I was in my underwear and he was in his boxers. The position we were is was definitely how you have sex but just with clothes on. He was stroking back and forth until he came and where he came was definitely where my vaginal opening is but mind you, he was in his boxers and I was in my underwear. My underwear was thin. I definitely felt the fluid get on my underwear and I immediately freaked out. Is it possible that his semen got inside of me, especially since I\u2019m sure he came on my vaginal opening, despite us in our thin underwear? \n\nIs it possible for me to get pregnant? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ovulating however I do think my period is in 10 days. Moreover, I\u2019m a virgin and this was my first time dry humping.\n\nAlso, if I plan on taking a pregnancy test, when would be the best time for me to take it? Is one week a good time frame?",

I know mine was. Just need some peace of mind, ig.",

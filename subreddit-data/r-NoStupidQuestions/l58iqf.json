I just enjoy these two hours alone before she and the kids wake up.. that's the only time alone I can get in my day... And I really like it.. But I'm starting to think it might be weird or a bad sign... Like usually people love to spend time with their families..\nAny married people out there with thoughts on this..?\n\nEdit: THANK you for all the awards I really appreciate your feedback and support too !",

Of course they need other people. That's how people survive.",

Codependency is not the strong desire, even the extremely strong desire to be close to people you love or care about. It is the inability to tolerate that desire not constantly being filled because you do not have a sufficiently well developed sense of self respect, such that you do not interpret that desire\u2019s temporarily not being filled as an indication of your undesirability. It\u2019s when your partner wants to read instead of chat, and instead of saying, \u2018sounds good, I\u2019ll call my friend\u2019 or \u2018cool, going to catch up on some show\u2019 or whatever you like doing, you say, \u2018oh what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 or \u2018really, you don\u2019t want to tell me about your day or hear about mine,\u2019 etc.\n\nCodependency and dependency are not the same. Humans are all dependent on one another, of course, and they desire closeness. Codependency is when you have no tolerance for delaying gratification of dependent needs and require constant reassurance from your partner (there\u2019s the \u2018co-\u2018 part) that the dependent relationship you are in is not in jeopardy \u2014 rather than being able to reassure yourself or having enough confidence that you wouldn\u2019t even need reassurance.",

Its about lacking value, self worth and independence and needing someone/or a relationship that validates or fulfills in you what you that which you can\u2019t yourself. Co dependency goes above and beyond simply needing a normal human connection or level of intimacy in a relationship. It\u2019s building what often can turn into a toxic situation and lead to severe outcomes without the other person. \n\nwhen you can\u2019t function without a relationship/someone because of what they or it does for you or when needing someone so bad it can effect or impair ones rational judgement, that isn\u2019t normal human need for someone/connection",

Like any behavioral issue, it's not the simple act of engaging in the behavior that can be a problem but, when that act starts to take over your life and causes problems with your ability to function in a healthy way, it can be a problem. The concept of co-dependency isn't about making someone feel guilty for needing the support of others. It's about recognizing that sometimes *over* depending on others can be problematic. \n\nI used to be in a relationship with someone who was bipolar and displayed symptoms of co-dependency and, believe me, it is very damaging to the person you're with. I never felt like a whole person in the relationship. I felt more like a nanny than a partner while my ex made me feel like it was my job to make sure that he was ok emotionally. \n\nThe fact that the person upthread says they learned that co-dependency isn't real in *couple's therapy* of all places makes me wonder if they got anything useful out of the process. It sounds (at least on the surface) like they went in, barely engaged in the process, and took only what they wanted from it.",

She likes the news (has several newspaper online subscriptions) or texting/calling friends and relations.  And me? I'm on Reddit, Netflix, Prime or reading books. We will often interrupt the others attention to read or play something interesting to the other. She has an office upstairs for her business and I refinished our basement into my office/guest suite with a full bath. It's very comfortable and I love being down there but we really enjoy each others company.  After a long day we each like to do our own thing but it's nice to do it together.",

At 5am to 7am it's quiet, no one is up, no one needs anything and I get that time to myself uninterrupted (most of the time).  I'm not slightly on edge waiting for the next call of \"Daaaaaaad?\" or the sound of a dog scratching the door etc.\n\nI'm a much happier person because of this, it doesn't hurt anyone so it's win, win for everyone.

I'm 42 with 3 adult children, sleep odd hours, work odd hours, drink, smoke, have no skin care routine, plenty of stress etc and I still get asked for ID when our legal age is 18. My mother and grandmother both look a good 20 years younger than they are also. I have met many people younger than me without kids who looked much older than me. So having kids or not really has very little to do with how old someone looks.",

I used to really need at least 8 hours of sleep if not 10 every day. I was famous for napping. Turns out I just have a lot of allergies. So with allergy medicine now I can comfortably sleep 5 or 7 hour days regularly with much more energy and wakefulness than before.",

It's possible, but don't expect it or beat yourself up about it.\n\nI do have allergies too. I'm just not really healthy I guess, although I take medicine and such. But I also need a lot of sleep. And that's ok. I would like to have more hours a day, but I like those hours to be not miserabel. So if i have to choose between feeling miserabel and more hours a day or sleeping more and feeling well, I choose the last one.",

I usually have 30 minutes to an hour of alone to do whatever I want when I get home from work before he he gets home from work. It\u2019s nice to be able to unwind, just be silent and putter around for a bit without having to answer to anyone. I\u2019m sure sometimes my bf uses his alone time to look at porn, and while that can sometimes make me feel insecure, that has more to do with the fact I\u2019m not as hot as I was in my 20\u2019s when we met.\n\nOp\u2019s wife seems like there is something underneath this that is really bothering her. Maybe she has good reason, but maybe it\u2019s coming from a place of personal insecurity like mine does. The fact that she\u2019s projecting and trying to shame op into feeling weird about wanting alone time makes me that some type of couples counseling and individual therapy might be a good idea.",

Think of it as being like recharging your batteries -- something you need to do, so that you can cheerfully give attention and patience to your loved ones when they need it. This practice probably makes you a much better companion the rest of the time. Don't worry about it.",

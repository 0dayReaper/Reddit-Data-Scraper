For example, if a child is born with USA airspace they would become an American national. However, if that country doesn't allow the child born in the country to become a citizen, it will then adopt the nationality of either the mother or father.\"",

If we are talking about citizenship and all that then it just inherits its parents citizenship in the majority of cases. This is more discussion of what nation of origin we put down on a birth certificate.",

            "comment": "It depends on where the plane is registered and where the actual birth occurs. Ordinarily, the plane's registration is the \"nationality\" of the plane so it would be treated as having taken place in that country. However, some countries (like the US) grant citizenship based on birth in its territory so a child born in US airspace can claim dual-US citizenship.\n\nhttps://best-citizenships.com/2023/01/24/airborne-citizenship-for-child-born-in-a-flight/",

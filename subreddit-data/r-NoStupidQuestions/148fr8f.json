Phrases and idioms can really stand out. \n\nA friend of mine told me that when scammers talk to her, they will claim to be from the US, and will say something like \u201cI am Charles by name.\u201d We can understand what that means easily enough, but the structure of that sentence is so odd that no native speaker would ever use it. But it probably is a structure that works in their native language, so it sounds right to them.",

In my experience, it\u2019s often two English first names, or a first name from their culture with an English first name as a last name. It\u2019s not foolproof, as English speakers will literally name their kid anything, and a few English first names can also be last names (\u201cRegina George\u201d is a believable American name), but very few English *female* given names are common last names. \u201cMadison\u201d and \u201cMacKenzie\u201d are the only ones I can think of, and they were last names for centuries before they were female given names. \n\nBut sometimes I get emails from people claiming to be recruiters signing their name \u201cSally Jessica\u201d or similar, and it\u2019s like ok. That\u2019s not real. \n\nOn the same note, alleged business people referring to you as Miss or Mr Firstname. It\u2019s at best extremely overfamiliar, and more commonly actively condescending in English. There are cases where people might greet each other this way in social situations, but it\u2019s not how an American professional would reach out to a recruit.",

A speaker of AAVE will most certainly use double negations and it is universally understood in their social context. The habitual \"be\" is an elegant concept with a clear meaning and is also universally understood in the same way. \n\n\nTo differentiate the non-native speaker from the native speaker we have so many different clues just from a single sentence. Is this person's accent one which we can place in a group known to us? Does the word choice  fit the patterns we have come to expect? Where do they place the stress? Are they using phonemes which are foreign to us or do they mix up different phonemes? Maybe they are inconsistent when they use z and s. \n\nClearly one can be considered a native speaker even whilst using non-standard grammar (He be running dawg) but if we break the expected patterns it will immediately sound foreign.",

They laughed and informed her that they switched because they couldn't understand *each other* \\- one was from the west coast on Karm\u00f8y, and one was from the east near Oslo. They said that the difference in accent and pronunciation made it so that it was easier for them to just speak in English.",

They'd just moved here to do a year abroad and their formal English was excellent but their conversational English was very limited. I remember helping one of them with spelling/grammar on an essay and he pointed to some word and said \"Is it so spelt?\". As a native English speaker I'm not even sure I can tell you why that question is so awkward (someone more knowledgeable in grammar than me might) but I can tell you that it sounds really awkward to an English ear. I'm not entirely sure it's even wrong, but I'm sure I'd never say it that way.",

For example I was proofreading a translation of a French technical manual to English -- in English instructional books it's very common to have a text box in the margin with special notes like warning you're about to do an action which can't be undone (e.g. permanently delete a file). In English, it is always a \"Warning\". The draft I was proofreading labelled the box \"Attention!\". That's a grammatically correct translation of the French word into English (both French and English appearing identical), but it's never the word a native English speaker would use in that situation so it sticks out like a sore thumb. \n\nThere's many examples of this, most you would only realize if it was done incorrectly/used infrequently used language",

It was about Plato and how he used the word democracy but meant something different by it to what we do. The tutor gave us the example of the word \"Thacherite\" and how it means \"someone who pertains to the policies of Margaret Thatcher\" and anyone could look that up and understand it. But they wouldn't understand why it's a pejorative to half of the UK and not to the other. To understand the meaning of the word is to understand a lot about the last 40 years of British politics.\n\nThese subtleties of language have always fascinated me.",

            "comment": "Often. Non native speakers with perfect elementary grammar often get lavished with praise that they \u201cspeak English better than most native speakers,\u201d but this isn\u2019t strictly true. The reality is that native speakers and non-native speakers make very different types of mistakes. \n\nNative speakers are a lot more likely to make grammatical or vocabulary errors in writing that would not be detectable if they were speaking. \u201cYou\u2019re\u201d vs \u201cyour,\u201d using an apostrophe before any random \u201cs\u201d in a word, etc. Native English speakers spoke English before they could read or write, and had to sit down in classrooms and learn for years to understand why \u201cthere\u201d and \u201ctheir\u201d are spelled differently. How things sound is almost always going to take priority over how things are written. \n\nA lot of the \u201cmistakes\u201d we make in writing also literally aren\u2019t mistakes when speaking, or are not mistakes at all in a specific dialect. Most non-native speakers learn standard American English or standard British English, but not the gazillion dialects of English that are totally valid in spoken and narrative written language, and will become very frustrated that they see/hear something that would not be correct in an academic setting. Some native speakers get like this too, and will interpret slang or a valid grammatical construct within another dialect a \u201cmistake\u201d on the same level as confusing \u201cthere\u201d and \u201ctheir.\u201d \n\nOn the other hand, non native speakers, even if they speak very well, will usually use the occasional weird turn of phrase, often because they\u2019re trying to translate something idiomatic directly from their language that they don\u2019t really understand is an idiom. Or, they learned in a classroom setting and got a lot of SAT words or old-timey/extremely regional English idioms, but not words and phrases that English speakers actually use. So they\u2019ll go around talking someone\u2019s great grandmother writing an application letter to Harvard. Another thing is pronunciation. I have met several Germans who I initially believed to be *British* because they spoke fluent English with British accents. Yet for every single one of them, pronouncing the letters \u201cw\u201d or \u201cv\u201d ends up giving them away eventually, because they *always* mess that up. \n\nThe exception is for people who speak English as a second language but learned that second language very young, before or concurrently with learning how to read. I know a number of people who entered American school in kindergarten speaking only Polish, Spanish, or Mandarin. They all spoke English exactly like Americans by 2nd grade.",

Sentences might be incomplete or seemingly nonsensical because the conversation they're in provides that context whereas non-native speakers probably learn a more formal sentence structure that's more 'correct' but isn't how people actually talk. \n\nMost languages start to build up these informal shortcuts as native speakers get bored of providing full sentences each time and start to cut out extraneous parts but informal English is really far along in the process, sections of conversations will frequently have single word sentences like 'alright?' which are meaningless on their own but work in context.",

            "comment": "Of course. non-native english speakers too! I love trying to guess what language does someone speak based on their accent.\n\nEvery non-native-level English speaker has some degree of accent in their english pronunciation, which is basically using their native language\u2019s vowel(s) and consonant(s) instead of the proper english ones. For example, I\u2019m Italian, and people over here pronounce water (/w\u0254t\u0259/) as /uoter/.\n\nThere are some people, like me, who don\u2019t have such an accent yet don\u2019t pronounce things quite right. I think that\u2019s called a cadence.\n\nAlso there are various things that are done in different parts of English-speaking countries that make you sound a lot more native. For example, I\u2019ve learned English in California, and they don\u2019t pronounce the \u201ct\u201d. So the water that I said before becomes something like /w\u0254r\u0259/\n\nI should also add, there are variations of the same word that might give away a non-nativity. For example, a real life example I had, was mispronouncing the word for aluminum. In the US, it\u2019s Aluminum. In the UK, it\u2019s Aluminium. In Spanish and Italian, both my native languages, it\u2019s \u201cAluminio\u201d and \u201calluminio\u201d respectively.\n\nI was waiting @ a Panda Express while talking to the phone, and unknowingly said \u201caluminium\u201d. A guy then asked me where I was from, since he recognized that no American would have said that",

I can tell when he speaks, there are some very subtle clues that are hard to describe, but it has something to do with his pronunciation. \n  \nIt's not quite an accent, but some vowel sounds will be slightly \"off,\" (which is fair because American English has a ridiculous amount of different vowel sounds and every last one of them is completely arbitrary), or his Ls will be a little too hard, things like that.  \n  \nThese differences that I hear are very slight. They aren't enough to nail down an accent or place of origin, but just enough that I can hear he isn't a native speaker.",

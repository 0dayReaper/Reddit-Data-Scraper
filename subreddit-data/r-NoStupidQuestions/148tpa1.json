In addition to that, for me at least, you just get the impression that he's a genuinely nice guy in real life.  A lot of attractive, famous guys are real dicks, and to me, that's really unattractive and I don't care how objectively good-looking they are, I lose all interest when a guy thinks he's the bomb just because he's famous and attractive.  That describes most of Hollywood.",

You basically play as a head of government and make policy changes.",

The economy was mostly player-driven and there was a strong economy, but there wasn't, other than with some Gil sellers, a case of a capitalist class owning the means of production. Certainly, it wasn't the experience of the vast majority of players that someone else owned the means of their production.",

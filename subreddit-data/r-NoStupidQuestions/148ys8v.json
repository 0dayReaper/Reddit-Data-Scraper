The Christian sabbath is (for most varieties of Christianity) Sunday.\n\nSome varieties of Judaism are very strict about not doing any kind of work, where turning on a light switch counts as work. OP is asking about loopholes.\n\nOne loophole which I am familiar with is elevators which are constantly running and stop at every floor, so you never need to do the work to tell it what floor to stop on",

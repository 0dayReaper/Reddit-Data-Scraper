They find a group that agrees with them on a few things that are important to them, and that's what they vote for. \n\nThose groups usually have a few very agreeable positions to earn votes, and they have many fucked up positions to continue to earn money from donations. \n\nBecause of all this, the organization can continue to rake in money and receive support, while actively working against the majority of their supporters.\n\nEdit since this blew up: I am completely aware that I did not represent every government and oversimplified the ones that I did.

I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I think the fact that voting day is always on a workday and most polling places are only open for normal business hours, prevents a lot of young people from making it in time. And that doesn\u2019t take into account the many examples of voter suppression we\u2019ve seen under this presidency and in the previous ones. Like why do old people vote more often? They\u2019re retired and have all day to make it to the polls, but a young 20-something juggling work, school, kids, bills, and whatever else, barely have time for themselves. Of course that doesn\u2019t take mail-in voting into account, but did people really know that was a feasible option before the pandemic? In my limited experience, I\u2019ve found that the average American citizen has no idea there are other voting options available. Maybe this will give people the push they need to take their rights more seriously.",

            "comment": "I'm from Kenya, and if I may be honest, majority of the population here do not understand the functions of government e.g. the different arms and their roles. Most, I believe, don't even understand why we have a government in the first place. I can't blame them because the way governments are structured post-colonization is different from how we organized ourselves in our small tribal, societies pre-colonization.\n\nMost of the people look at politicians as celebrities and don't even hold them accountable for failures related to their job descriptions. Instead, most care about their wealth, tribe and popularity. We currently have an MP who was caught by CCTV cameras inside a club (_which had been shut down but this is another different story on its own_) shooting the DJ after an argument ensued. The video made rounds on news media outlets and social media, but nothing is yet to be done. He still holds his sit as MP and even streams live on social media to tutor kids who are currently at home because of the pandemic, on various subjects. The DJ survived, but is currently paralysed from his neck downwards.\n\nNow, you may wonder how this man is still MP with a video of him attempting murder doing the rounds. I wonder too. A lot of Kenyans wonder this too. However, he still freely roams around his constituency meeting his constituents who seem to still adore him &amp; even mingles with / hangs around \"powerful\" politicians e.g. his party leader and even the president (at political rallies pre-corona).\n\nSee, you might think that the most important thing to ALL Kenyans should be having a functional government void of corruption, that works in our favour to improve our quality of life. \n\nHowever, you'd be surprised by how, with a huge, illiterate, tribalistic population, these basic expectations no longer matter and that MOST Kenyans just don't care about things beyond their tribes, cultures and religion when it comes to government and holding government officials accountable.\n\nI can't explain it in simple words because there are so many things that go into it, but what I can say is, you'd think fighting corruption would be at the top of the list for most citizens, right? Well, I'm sorry to say, but it just isn't.",

If something happens in America, or Canada, or the UK, you can't hold people accountable because doing so would destabilize the whole country. But in Kenya, it's not that it's as practically harmful to hold someone accountable, just the general consensus is they hold so little power its not worth bothering? Anyone could go out and just kill that guy, and justify it to themselves fairly easily considering the video of attempted murder. There's just not much point to putting yourself in that much danger because getting rid of the guy doesn't really matter.",

I'm just gonna highlight and respond to a couple paragraphs from it.\n\n&gt; Principiis obsta and Finem respice\u2014\u2018Resist the beginnings\u2019 and \u2018Consider the end.\u2019 But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things might have. And everyone counts on that might.\n\nIt's been foreseen and widely explained in the US. The rebranded 'opposition' or 'resistance' party remains part of the same political duopoly, serving nearly the same set of lobbyists and monied interests. Party loyalism is stronger than ever on \"both sides\". Third, fourth, and fifth parties remain relegated to the fringe. No sitting president, no matter how vocally opposed to their predecessor's executive overreaches, has acted to reduce the role's power while it's in their grasp.\n\n(Bolding added, italicization in original)\n\n&gt; But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. *That\u2019s* the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the **\u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops** in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\nMaking a show of patriotic symbolism is a very popular tactic for silencing dissent, obfuscating motives, and painting one's political opposition as the enemy. It's a great distraction.",

So revolution is only an option for countries where people already don't have any freedom or political power whatsoever, like Belarus, definitely not for country like USA",

            "comment": "I can only speak for the US but here's what I've gathered:\n1. Most people only vote every 4 years, in the Presidential election. There are midterms (deciding federal and state senators/representatives, some state governors, state proposals etc) every 2 years, and there are also local elections every year (city and county elections for positions like Mayor, sheriff, treasurer, councilmen, and local proposals like millages or new ordinances). This causes problems because the president unfairly bears the weight of every american's happiness in every facet of their life, despite the president actually having fairly little control over how cities or states handle a given problem. Nothing changes locally because *no one votes locally*\n2. The majority of voters are not wealthy. Many people in this country have to work overtime or work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They also have to manage all the other aspects of their lives (kids, parents, bills, medical issues, the broken dishwasher) and unfortunately there isn't very much time left to stand in line at the polls and cast a ballot, let alone research candidates and proposals to ensure you're voting in your best interest. \n3. For many positions, there are no term limits. This means that a person can hold office for *decades*. We often worry about what good/bad things a president can do for the country in 2 term (8 years total), but we think nothing of the senator or representative that's been in office for 24 years. The lack of term limits in addition to the practice of voting for names that we recognize causes elected officials to become content and comfortable in their position; they know that the likelihood of them getting voted out is low. They have no real incentive to make lasting changes. \n\nThere's a lot I'm probably leaving out, but these are IMO 3 of the biggest reasons.\n\nEdit: thank you for the silver! My first award ever!

We are all aware of how corrupt it all is, but it's easier to just ignore it and do what you want in your life. Nobody really cares. We all got the illusion of freedom of choice, and can keep busy with technology, and entertainment. Meanwhile, we're all caught up in our differences and hating each other for no real reason.

This social system comes with other benefits too; no one pays for medical expenses, educations arent just free, students receive a monthly income. And yes the level of education is also ranking high. I fail to see why this type of system is not demanded by all people if not for the benefits, then perhaps for the low level of corruption.\n\nI am not saying there isn\u2019t any corruption at all. Usually though when it happens, our news agencies have a tendency to make sure it gets the people\u2019s attention, maybe because we are not bombarded constantly by insignificant idiocracy and our laws actually demand all news to be fact checked and unbiased.\n\nI truly love traveling and meeting people in any country, however it\u2019s demoralizing to see how some struggle under the weight of their leaders ability to bleed their country for personal benefits or in the interests of friends and/or corporations. I am not all to optimistic on this part, but it would be great to one day see a world where governments are truly for the people, by the people within this path we\u2019ve chosen of capitalism. Guess though morals have always been for sale - just a matter of figures being high enough and it makes sense in some ways since we all strive for just a little bit better, though some will never be satisfied.\n\nThis time around a new way of corruption seems to have taken hold, which is that when a leader is openly corrupt but uses peoples own identity against them. Like if your a democrat then to the republicans all you do is spread lies and vice versa. In-between these lines a leader and anyone in power is free to do whatever as the people are too busy to fight over who is right and who is wrong. Maybe not a new tactic but it is utilized to the extreme and it really works perfectly.\n\nEdit: sry for the rant! To answer your question I believe corruption is part of any society and would claim it usually sits at an level tolerated by it\u2019s inhabitants. Maybe someone will dispute this? It\u2019s an inherent part of having power and can be an effective tool to both get and keep high ranking positions. Most people either feel too low a status to do much or too comfortable to engage or for a small percentage they benefit and thus have a reason to keep the current structure. This is also why most demonstrators are usually young university students, who are idealistic, not burden with materialistic needs or too comfortable in family, loans, jobs and such. They feel the spark of fighting a corrupt system, one that\u2019ll either break the people in power or themself into submission - to rare has it been the former.",

It's your choice. \n\nIf you stick to the liberal ideological framework, which you get taught in school (capitalism is good, competition is good, individuals exist, political representation works, nations exists, property is good, hierarchy is natural, greed is good, your are free,...) you simply cannot imagine to lead your own life or that change is possible at all. You stick to the status quo and it's behavioral programs, try to get the best piece of the cake you can get and just are a mindless cog in the wheel. \n\nNews flash: Liberalism (the ideology (which includes all flavors of the american electoral politics (you to republicans!), not what US-americants call liberalism) is utter and total bullshit. It's a philosophical framework which fuses together the most incoherent bullshit some people could think of to secure their privileges (Hobbes, Keynes, Smith). All it's basic tenets are lies and have been proven wrong by science (or by philosophy in the case of philosophical questions). \n\n* There are no individuals, see Nietzsche and the whole science of psychology\n* Hierarchy is not natural, see anthropology especially Graebers work on Madagassean \"anarchy\", Herrschaftsfreie Institutionen Texte zur Stabilisierung staatsloser, egalit\u00e4rer Gesellschaften by R\u00fcdiger Haude, Thomas Wagner\n* Cooperation is natural - see Mutual Aid by Peter Kropotkin, or alternatively basic evolution (hint: symbiosis is the basis of complex live forms , humans got domesticated by wheat and trees form an \"internet\" of root networks and help each other)\n* Property or rather the concentration of it led to the collapse of every empire EVER. (See history or What is Property? by Pierre Joseph Proudhon and Debts: the first 5000 years by David Graeber) Humanity lived 99% of its existence in usufruct (the total absence of property) up until 5000 years ago. \n* Political representation is running in circles, social struggles are fighting for the same rights they fought 100 years ago \n* Capitalism destroys the basic foundations of live on this planet, not just climate, deforestation, acidity of the oceans, monocultures (lets wait till the phosphor runs out in 20  years, looking forward to global starvation) and urbanization turn the planet into an unlivable hellhole (for proof see science)\n* Freedom as defined by liberal nation states is simply put the right to own property and the property of your mind (you also do not exclusively own your body, as you sell it in wage labor). This in itself is a tautological formulation like \"you get wet when it rains\"\n* nations and nation states have not existed 400 years ago. The first one was the US, previous empires were all multicultural and multi-ethnic",

            "comment": "I\u2019m Filipino and the government there is probably one of the most governments. I was born there and moved to America when I was 10 so living in two very different countries gives me a unique perspective. \n\nI think corruption in the Philippines is so bad because it\u2019s part of the culture. I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of Filipinos don\u2019t have respect for authority. People generally don\u2019t follow the rules. People never come on time, people litter everywhere, skipping lines is normal, cops aren\u2019t feared, people build houses on the sidewalks, etc. \n\nNow on to the government itself. When someone is a politician, it means they\u2019re rich rich. And the longer they\u2019ve been in politics, the richer they get. Why? Because for every funding they all get cuts. This starts at the very top and trickles down to the lowest positions. Even then, for congress/senate, the lawmakers don\u2019t really get a say in what they decide. They have to agree to their party because if they don\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t have been able to run in the first place. They also would get funding taken away from them which means they lose all the money they spent on elections.\n\nAnd speaking of elections, you know vote-buying? It\u2019s a literal term in the Philippines where people line up and receive money from candidates in exchange for a promise of their vote. This means that only those who are wealthy can run for office. Imagine in my hometown, which is a smaller developing city. The winning candidate for governor spent $17 million, and donations never count much usually,in just one election to win. And he earned it back in less than a year.... That\u2019s an incredible amount of money especially in pesos. \n\nAnd those wealthy politicians? Well their children are succeeding them. It\u2019s extremely common to have family members in other positions for the same area. This ensures that they continue the \u201cfamily business.\u201d Politicians and their families are seen as royalty in their respective areas. They\u2019re followed around by military (usually because they\u2019re extremely wealthy and are targets for kidnapping) and are seen as local celebrities. \n\nI think one of the main reasons the government system allows itself to be corrupt is that higher ups choose the government workers. For example, the governor is responsible for the public departments (ex education, constructions, hospitals/clinics, etc.) within the province (again imagine it like a state). This means that whenever there\u2019s a new governor, all these positions are wiped out, maybe not completely but can be if the governor decides to. So new teachers, new doctors, new assistants, new everyone. And these people have to be loyal to their governor. Therefore, they have complete control over every decision that needs to be decided. \n\nSo why can governments be openly corrupt? It\u2019s because it is systematically allowed to, at least in the Philippines, due to the complete control politicians have in a giant web of network. Starting from the Congress/senate and president, they have ties to local governments and thus all the public affairs in the smallest minuscule capacity that ensures absolute cooperation and loyalty. This corrupt system has been going on forever and to be in politics means playing in their own game. I personally think there\u2019s no fix in the corruption of the Philippine government. They would have to burn it all down and restart from scratch. \n\n\nP. S. I can\u2019t believe I wrote an entire essay on Filipino corruption. I guess I\u2019ve been inspired while being stuck here in the Philippines and having to experience how the government handled the pandemic.",

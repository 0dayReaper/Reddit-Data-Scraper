    "postText": "A few weeks ago I had to drop a class for multiple reasons, the main one being the fact that I had my main form of commuting stolen from me causing extreme stress.  \nSince then, said stress has made me extremely sick.. Like bed ridden sick, meaning I've now missed over a week of classes + now 2 deadlines.   \nI cannot get a doctors cert because I can't afford a doc appt, and regardless my college doesn't grant extensions for deadlines that have already passed...  \n\n\nAll of this has culminated into a melting pot of failure.   \n\\- I've now failed 3 assignments meaning if I want to move to semester 2 I will have to re-do those classes by taking on triple the workload of everyone else (basically impossible for me to pass since I couldnt even handle the baseline workload for semester 1)  \n\\- failing classes means my government no-longer loans money for my course, meaning I'd have to front $15k just to re-attempt the course (absolutely not possible, there isn't a single cent of savings in my family)  \n\\- Everyone around me is finding the course piss easy which has had me questioning my own intelligence... If it's so easy for them why is it 700 tonnes of anxiety and stress for me?  \n\n\nHow am I supposed to cope with all this? I cant afford therapy, I cant afford to go another year without working, at what point is it justifiable to just check out? At what point is it unfair that my friends and family expect me to keep living and breathing regardless of my situation?",

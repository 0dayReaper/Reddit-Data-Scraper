    "postText": "I see a lot of news about how the Federal Reserves wants to hike rates or whatever, and I\u2019m under the impressions that they change something called the fed funds rate, which I think is the rate that the Federal Reserve lends money to banks? Why does this have an impact on the interest rates in the economy as a whole? Can a bank charge a lower rate if they\u2019d like?",

Sometimes they might reduce it slightly if they feel they can get more customers that way\n\nThis has a flow on impact to the rest of the economy. Businesses will always pass their costs onto the customer, or in the case of companies which make huge profits use increases as an excuse to charge customers more while still making huge profits.",

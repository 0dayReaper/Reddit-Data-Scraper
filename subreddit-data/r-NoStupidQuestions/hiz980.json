Get an unsliced loaf of your favorite type of bread (I prefer sourdough) and cut it into cubes then toss them into a bowl with a generous amount of olive oil and mix it up. Season with kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder, hidden valley ranch seasoning and a dash of cayenne then bake it at 375 degrees for about 10ish minutes or until you see that they\u2019re turning golden brown.\n\nI used to be a chef and that\u2019s what we would do with every single loaf of bread that went stale before we could use it. People always love them, extra croutons on a Caesar salad was one of my most request add-ons from my regulars.\n\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone\u2019s interest. I promise I\u2019ll deliver as soon as I can. In the mean time for everyone asking if they can purchase a copy I would much prefer you make a donation to my favorite charity [Meals on Wheels.](https://www.mowsac.org/making-a-donation/) Given everything that\u2019s going on right now we need to make sure our elderly population is being taken care of as they\u2019re the most at risk but still absolutely deserve to be able to enjoy good meals.",

Legitimately, they are better-tasting, faster, and just all-around superior in every way.",

The mix itself was a recipe someone thought up years later, and it became popular. The cereal boxes started printing the recipe directly on the box since people were buying it just to make the mix. Eventually, they decided to capitalize and just straight up sold the pre-made mix. And that's where we are today.)",

You can cut or tear the bread. Lower temp for longer time will get them crisp through without a soft middle.\n\nIf you get a paper bag (like lunch bag size) you can put the crisp bread in it, drizzle over any fat source you want, and any seasoning you like, add salt if it's not in there already. Roll the top closed and shake it. Works for seasoning popcorn too.\n\nFlavors to try, together or separate: Old Bay, nutritional yeast, celery salt, garlic salt, onion salt, any powdered season you can get your hands on, any dry herb, any dry soup mix, those packets of seasoning like egg drop soup or taco seasoning or French onion soup or dip mix like ranch powder. \n\nGo crazy!",

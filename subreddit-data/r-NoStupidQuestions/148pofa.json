Because that could be a huge problem.\n\nBasically, you leaving blunts in your car could be seen as you potentially being under the influence of a controlled substance, which would put both you and the drunk driver at potentially equal fault for the accident.\n\nQuick tip for people:  Don't smoke weed in your car, including states where it's legal to smoke weed.  You can still get in trouble for impaired driving when they smell the weed or see your half smoked doobie.",

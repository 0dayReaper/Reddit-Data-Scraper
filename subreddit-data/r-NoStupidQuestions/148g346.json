This was never 100% true, but when Boomers were hitting adulthood it was easier to be self-sufficient and be able to live on your own with a normal paycheck. \n\nSince this is no longer the case, Millennials now are noticing that the stigma doesn't make sense, especially now when most people in the US can't afford to live paycheck to paycheck and pay rent. Boomers now are also learning that housing has gotten way too out of control, and are learning to be okay asking for help of their children and also okay helping their children. \n\nTL:DR - Nothing but social stigma from a different time.",

When you got to the point where you\u2019d want to move away to start your career in the city or whatever, you\u2019d find a nice boarding house, and later a roommate.\n\nI think the \u201cleave home and get your own place all to yourself,\u201d idea had a pretty short lifespan as ideas go - a few decades, maybe 60 years?\nIt isn\u2019t all that reasonable now. I think some houses should be built a bit differently to accommodate families living together but give different generations a bit more privacy, and I bet that\u2019s the way things will go.",

For example, if you have your parents, they\u2019re one family, then you have you and your spouse and children, that\u2019s another family. And maybe you have your brother and his family. You all live together. \n\nWho\u2019s in charge? Who makes the decisions? Who\u2019s responsible for what? Who disciplines or doesn\u2019t discipline the children? Who cooks? Who cleans and what? All of this could be decided beforehand I guess but someone would still have to be head of household to determine that. In Asian families, that would be the son\u2019s mother but especially in ancient (1200-1300) China, that caused some major strife between the new daughter in law and the mother, especially regarding how kids are handled. Idk if it\u2019s changed since then, I\u2019m sure it has to some extent. \n\nPersonally, while I can handle being around extended family for some time, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t raise my kids like they do. We don\u2019t believe in the same ways of doing things. My husband and I have different philosophies on how to run our lives than the rest of our family members. It\u2019s made us the black sheep of our families. The black successful sheep I might add, esp in comparison to our siblings who DO still live with our parents. \n\nWhile my mother in law is nice enough, she has to be in charge. But so do I.

Loud and aggressive judgement of your shopping choices, for example I once bought six sampler glasses of wine (6 oz each)  to try out and see what type of wine I liked.  I told my parents about it and then they proceeded to call me a drunk and recommend that I go to AA for the next month.

I was barely allowed to cook, I wasn't allowed to do my own laundry, and anything I did do was wrong. And when I didn't do them I was wrong, too. When my dad got mad he would yell, spit in my face, or push me. I have been pushed down stairs. When I left that house and was finally done with them it was because of a threat they made to my kids. There were at least three holes in the wall that my father punched. The house was never cleaned properly. My mom was medically abusing me to keep me sick and in her care. And she would give us all so much food poisoning. \n\nMy in laws are not much better, but for different reasons. My in laws are divorced and with new people. My fil is a narcissist racist bigot with a gf who holds the same beliefs. We stop allowing him near the kids when he said black people were going to drag all the white people out of their homes and shoot them in the streets...in front of my kids. Then he made racist remarks about being Italian. Guess who has two half Italian grandkids and a full blooded Italian dil? He says I can't take a joke.\n\nMy mil is also a narcissist and a control freak. She is the type of person who has a perfect yard and her house is a show room. To her, my house is a pig sty because while I clean I don't go as far as to scrub the walls every week. And I only mop or vacuum once or twice a week (but we sweep every day). She was mad that there were papers on our table. It's the end of the school year and everything just came home. We are sorting it, but I need the kids home to sort it and their last day is tomorrow. It's not a big deal, but to her we are living in squalor. Also, I haven't been weeding the flower beds because I have a chronic illnesses and being in the hot sun causing me to have a bad reaction where I break out in hives from head to toe. We have people who cut our lawn every week. It's not like it is all overgrown. It was three flower beds that needed some work. \n\nShe is married to a man, who has always been nice to my husband and kids and I. He seems pretty chill. But he basically abandoned his kids to be with my mil and that something that never sat right with me. I don't know how you choose someone over your kids.\n\nNeedless to say, my husband and I both were living together and away from them as soon as we could do it. No amount of saving of money is worth that kind of bullshit. No amount of saving funds it worth putting my kids through that. There is no community and love. It's all control. They need total control while also acting like toddlers. And I know a lot of people who have parents with these kinds of issues.\n\nIf you have great parents, by all means, live at home. The reason it is looked down on in the dating game is because of the lack of privacy and independence. It's nice to be able to make a decision for yourself without having to talk to other people to make fair arrangements. If the generations could be respectful to each other, then great! But I have not seen that happen in my personal life.",

            "comment": "If my parents are active enough to be working and providing childcare, there is no need for them to be living in my house, and further, *they* don\u2019t want to. They are capable of living in their own house. Grandparents also don\u2019t need to live in the same house to provide childcare. My grandmother watched me daily when I was small, and she never lived with my parents. If grandparents live in communing distance, why should they throw away their own things and independence to move into someone else\u2019s house?\n\nIf my parents are *not* active enough to take care of their own household, there is a very good chance that they need professional care, and *it is elder abuse* to give them substandard care. Using my grandmother again as an example. The time between when my grandmother could cook and clean the house on her own and when she needed a literal nurse around the clock was very, very brief. \n\nPeople are also living longer and taking longer to buy houses and start families. The idea of your parents moving in with you is cute and all when you\u2019ve got your own house and kids by 25-30, your parents retire to an easy chair to lay like blobs by 60, and expect to be rotting in the ground by 72, while you\u2019re still in your 40s, maybe 50 at the oldest. But that\u2019s not how the lifecycle of healthy people works any more. By the time my grandparents were old enough to need help, my parents were too old to physically help them. It would have been elder abuse of two entire generation of elders to expect my parents and aunt (60-70 years old) to try and carry around and do the bidding of my 90 year old grandparents, in addition to all of them still working. My cousins and I were experiencing a combination of of being young parents to a house full of kids or literally not having the means to be stacking our thousands of aging relatives in a back room somewhere. \n\nThat\u2019s another thing. This isn\u2019t consistent, but American living spaces are often a lot smaller than foreigners assume. There is no \u201cback room somewhere\u201d for a lot of us. No one I know who has multiple kids that need to be cared for has extra space for a whole nother set of adults to be living with them. No one I know *without* kids has extra space either. Singles and childless couples are often living in one bedroom apartments, and those with multiple kids have every room occupied. Even if you argue \u201cwell in my country we\u2019d just convert the living room, share rooms, Americans are too spoiled, deedle-dee-doo-dah,\u201d that\u2019s not always an option here legally. If you rent, there are rules about how many people can live in the apartment and they *will* evict you for violating that. It\u2019s a safety hazard. \n\nBeyond all of that, honestly, neither generation fucking wants to for their own emotional and social well-being. I have no interest to slaving to my parents\u2019 old fashioned ideas to save a Buck. Not do they have any interest is kowtowing to my rules just because \u201cfaaaaaaaaamily ought to help each other.\u201d We don\u2019t even want to live in the same city. Should I quit my job and go there, a place that is such hell to me that it nearly killed me? Should my father quit his to go where I like, a place my parents find dirty and loud, where they don\u2019t know anyone? I have to keep a strict 9-5 schedule, while my dad wakes up before dawn and naps through the day and my mother stays up all night watching deafeningly loud television. We don\u2019t have compatible lifestyles, why cram us into the same house so we all fucking hate our lives, instead of letting us be happy in separate homes?  I know many people in multigenerational homes. It\u2019s working for some, but far fewer that claim so, none of them are as mentally or socially healthy as they should be.",

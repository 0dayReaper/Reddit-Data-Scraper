You can appreciate the night for a while, and then appreciate the morning too. You sleep very well. You can even stay in for a while or sleep extra if you feel like it.\n\nThe only bad thing is that you will want to sleep as soon as the sun is gone. That can be annoying at times.\n\nI also live very close to the Equator, so I suspect this one doesn't work as well in places with those weird changes to sunset and sunrise. I recently came from Rio de Janeiro, it was weird to see sunrise at like 4:30.",

After having to work from home when Covid first hit, he\u2019s decided he prefers it over going into the office. We\u2019ve got one adult child moved out, one in college, and another in high school who\u2019s busy and out doing his own thing. So before Covid, I\u2019d have a few hours during the day to do my own thing, or at least be alone. \n\nI never realized how grating it can be to have someone (even someone you love) around *constantly*. And he\u2019s a genuinely nice person, but a sensitive person - so if I tell him I\u2019d prefer he go into the office a couple days of the week, I think it would actually hurt his feelings. \nI know there are worse things in the world to complain about. But some days everything he does just irritates the hell out of me.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold!",

I feel like, in my predicament, I\u2019m the boyfriend here, my gf works remote full time and I used to be a full time streamer. Now that we\u2019re in a small 1 br apt. She needs quiet during the day and I\u2019m forced to be silent and mute as she takes a ton of calls throughout the day. I can be a sensitive person. But she\u2019s so understanding the caring to me. Just express yourself. I do to her. Sometimes I leave to a friends house and stay there all day only because I know she\u2019d enjoy th peace and quiet throughout her work day. Good luck.",

It\u2019s evolutionarily advantageous for a population to have staggered circadian rhythms, because sleeping is when you are most vulnerable. Early humans had a better chance of surviving through the night if someone else was awake and keeping watch. \n\nSo instead of the whole group sleeping and rising at the same times, leaving everyone vulnerable for 8 hours straight, we evolved early birds and night owls to take shifts. \n\nThe early bird brains are wired to release melatonin (sleepy hormone) in the early evening, while the night owls stay up to keep watch for the first stretch of the night. By the time the night owl brains release melatonin and they fall asleep, there are only 4 hours until the early birds start waking up and can keep watch through the early morning. \n\n4 hours of group vulnerability is much more survivable than 8 hours of group vulnerability. \n\nOf course, these days we don\u2019t need that evolutionary protection mechanism anymore and it sucks to be a night owl stuck in a world designed for early bird schedules.",

Basically the only time I'd actually fall asleep at a normal hour was after 2-3 days of only getting 4-5 hours of sleep, then I'd be right back where I started for a few more days.

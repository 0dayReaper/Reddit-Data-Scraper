It makes me think my father did some illegal activity when he was a child and everybody are scared of me.\n\n(Asked this on Google, but Google gave me a link to subreddits that were blocked).",

The chances of them knowing you because of something your father did are infinitesimally low. This happened to me for a while after I dyed my hair the first time. It was so new that I kinda forgot about it.",

It's probably in their best interest to do this as soon as possible, otherwise any inheritance they'd be entitled to is going toward paying the subscription.\n\nI recently had a conversation with my father about this, and he is setting aside a password-protected list on his computer of important information about his accounts etc. so that I have that information in the event of his death.",

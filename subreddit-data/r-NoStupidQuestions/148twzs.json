    "postText": "I know that an average resting HR is roughly 50-100 BPM, from what I think I\u2019ve heard, but what about standing up?\n\nMore so, what about when walking? At a slow pace? More of a standard pace?\n\nI was recently diagnosed with POTS and I\u2019m trying to get an idea of what a baseline should be when standing up (not simply a resting heart rate, because standing is a degree of activity, even if I\u2019m not actively, completely *moving*) and when I am walking. \n\nIf it really matters, I am 29 and AFAB (assigned female at birth\u2014 I use this language because I am nonbinary).",

            "comment": "A resting heart rate, on average, falls within the range of 60 to 100 bpm for most adults. When you're in an upright standing position, your heart has to work slightly harder to counteract the effects of gravity and pump blood against it. This normally leads to a mild increase in heart rate compared to when you're at rest or sitting - anywhere from 5 to 20 bpm higher than the resting heart rate. \n\n\nTherefore, a typical standing heart rate might fall between 65 and 120 bpm, depending on the individual.\n\n\nWhen walking/moving, heart rate generally increases due to the increased demand for oxygen and energy by the muscles involved in walking. Normally, the walking heart rate rises by about 10 to 30 bpm above the resting heart rate. During a brisk or more standard pace of walking, where you are walking at a faster speed, the heart rate will generally increase further - about 30 to 50 bpm above the resting heart rate. \n\n\nPOTS can be difficult to live with (I have it too), but it can also be very easy to manage. Many healthcare professionals recommend increasing salt intake in combination with adequate fluid intake. Sodium plays a role in regulating fluid balance and blood volume in the body. Increasing salt intake can potentially help POTS patients by increasing blood volume and improving blood flow, which may alleviate/prevent some of the symptoms (like lightheadedness, dizziness, or even syncope).\n\n\nGreat question, btw!",

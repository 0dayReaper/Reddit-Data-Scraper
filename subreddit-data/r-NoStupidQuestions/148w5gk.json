If we all conformed to the clear trends of sexuality we wouldn't be into kink.\n\nDepends on the people and their lifestyle. Sometimes you have to schedule sex because you lead busy lives anyway, and sometimes it is easy to add kink in a nondisruptive way. \n\nWhatever works.",

I think that even very vanilla people may be surprised that they may enjoy shades of it. Oh wow, I did not mean to make a pun about Fifty Shades of Gray. But yeah, I mean, vanilla people may like handcuffs or blindfolds or whatever. I strongly recommend that people try some sort of kink, it doesn't have to be hardcore.",

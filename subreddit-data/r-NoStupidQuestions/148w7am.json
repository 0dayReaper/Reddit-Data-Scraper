    "postText": "My parents and I(20M) got into a discussion about world healthcare systems. I\u2019m an American saying that our healthcare system is fatally flawed, and they were saying it\u2019s better then most other countries. Long sorry short I was saying that going to the hospital and going into a lot of debt is a horrible system. They were saying that in other counties it could take a long time to get care, like years for a knee surgery. They were also saying that if you are dying anyway (like have cancer or are too old) they will turn you away. \nIs this true for other counties? I don\u2019t have much experience with other countries so if you wouldn\u2019t mind, could you share some stories about it? (Quick side note I\u2019m also very interested in Sweden cause they kept using that as an example.)",

I can't understand how bad it is in America.",

They're not cutting corners. They're not fucking people over. They just have a rational policy system that isn't based around profit at any cost.",

They are trying to force people into private health care, which is unbelievably expensive.\n\nI had a positive bowl screen in September last year (blood found), still waiting for a colonoscopy, don't even have an appointment with the specialist until September this year,  then it's likely to be another 6 to 9 months before I can get the actual colonoscopy. Even if I could afford to go private it would take 6 months.\n\nMy partners mum has been waiting nearly two years for a knee replacement, she can hardly walk. \n\nOne of my best friends had to wait 3 years for a herniated disc. \n\nI have to pay $240 for an ultrasound, and it's a two week wait. \n\nAppointment with a psychiatrist $400 upfront and only $200 rebate (very few options within an hour of where I live, in outer western Melb and the closest is 40 minutes away depending on traffic Maybe 35min maybe over an hour to get there.) It's been 4 months since I got the referral.\n\nI had to pay $320 for an MRI with no rebate at all. \n\nPartner went to one of the only bulk billing clinics where we live, he had an appointment booked, but when checking in was told it would be an extra 2 to 3 hours wait. That was after it being 7 days from booking to first available appointment.\n\nI go to a non bulk billing Dr clinic and pay out of pocket, but even there it's a 7+ day wait for a simple Dr/gp appointment.\n\nI went to the emergency room at Sunshine Hospital back in March, around 8pm, the line was about 5 to 10 meters OUT OF THE DOOR!!! Went to Footscray, was told wait times would be 8 to 12 hours.\n\nI'm currently waiting for an ECG due to regular chest pain and a reoccurring numbness in my left arm, I have high cholesterol and at the Drs office my BP was 150/ something. Even after I get the ECG my Dr said it will be a 3 to 6 months wait to see a cardiologist.\n\nHonestly, you probably get better healthcare out of the city than we do here in Western Melbourne. I had no problems when I lived in Ballarat, but that was 5+ years ago.",

Those are just myth that were fed to them so they feel better about their insurances premiums and co-pays.\n\nBut it's not longer than anywhere to have care, and the good part is, we don't let our health plummet before consulting so we stay healthier. Also, no, no one is denied medical care because they are old. This is totally insane to think that any kind of society would be fine with that.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in Canada. Here\u2019s how I look at it: \n\nSomething urgent like heart attack or stroke - equal between us. You get care right away.\n\nSomething chronic like diabetes - Canada has the edge. The whole point is to keep the population healthy and able to work, the government will fund treatment and not skimp.\n\nSomething nagging and painful like getting a new knee - the US has the edge, assuming you have good insurance. You\u2019ll get it faster because of all the people who need it, many of them aren\u2019t in line for it - they can\u2019t afford it.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the argument before that old people are just left to die - maybe you think we put them on ice floes or something? The government is happier to fund treatment for old people than a private, for-profit health company would be.\n\nI had a family member die at 91 a couple of weeks ago and they did what they could. I suspect a news story from - I dunno? A couple of decades ago? ( I\u2019m old, doesn\u2019t seem that long ago) sometimes confuses people and makes them think we are not giving good care to older people. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the news story exactly after all this time but this was the gist of it- a very old orthodox Jewish man, 90 years old give or take, was in the hospital dying. He was at best semi-conscious and there was no hope he\u2019d get better, wake up, be able to converse with his family again - nothing. The doctors recommended that what was keeping him alive - a feeding tube? I think maybe just a saline drip? Be removed so he could die in peace instead of prolonging the whole thing. His kids refused and went for a court injunction banning the removal of whatever it was. \n\nThe thing was - the argument wasn\u2019t medical at all, never was. This would have been a normal medical practice for end of life care. The family didn\u2019t expect any kind of miracle, they just knew he\u2019d die more slowly. The argument was religious - because they were Orthodox Jews and interpreted the duty to preserve life at all costs to mean they couldn\u2019t remove whatever the thing was. \n\nThe argument made news here and I think got twisted into \u201cCanadian health care is eager to bump off old folks,\u201d in some areas of the US.",

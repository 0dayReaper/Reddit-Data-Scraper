Says he's pro-America but is basically controlled opposition for Vladimir Putin, the modern-day Hitler. \n\nHe's like Ulfric Stormcloak in Skyrim (actually oddly a Simpsons-like \"prediction\" of a future event). A radical contender for leadership over a country who was used by the Empire's  (similar to the UN in this comparison) most ardent foe, the Thalmor (Russia), to divide the country so they could conquer it. Ulfric honestly seemed very like Trump, stirring up fears of other races (the elves) and making everything about the uneven advancement of a prevalent religion in the country (belief in the 9 Divines rather than the 8). \n\nAnother weird parallel is with Johnathan Irons, big bad in 2014's COD: Advanced Warfare. \"Politicians don't know how to solve problems, but I do\". And he was played by Kevin Spacey, a rapist like Trump. \n\nThis whole 2015-2023 period had been strange",

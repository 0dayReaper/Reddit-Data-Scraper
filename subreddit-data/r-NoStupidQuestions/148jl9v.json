But if it's my partner tickling me, I will laugh and trash around.\n\nBut I read that we laugh while being tickled because it's like we're being attacked or something, but then, shouldn't you laugh more when someone you don't like is tickling you since it's more of an attack than when you don't mind it??",

            "comment": "IIRC tickling is kind of like when pups and kittens play fight - you learn to defend your vital areas in a safe, controlled way, and laughing is a way of communicating \u201cI\u2019m fine and don\u2019t feel threatened despite my slapping and thrashing around.\u201d  So when it\u2019s someone you trust like a partner or parent tickling their child, it\u2019s natural to laugh - it even encourages both people to keep \u201cplay fighting\u201d. But if it\u2019s someone you don\u2019t know very well, it feels like more of a threat and you will tense up and defend yourself, but not laugh.",

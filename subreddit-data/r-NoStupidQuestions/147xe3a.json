I wasn't racist, just isolated, and I always felt a bit weird around black people. Moving to a city fixed that pretty quickly. Don't worry by the way - you don't need to hate yourself for it, it's not your fault",

Because we just took it as given. I mean, at the end of the day they have the same accent as I do. And most were born in the same hospital as me even. Their Britishness was never in question with me, or any of our other friends. Maybe I\u2019ve just been fortunate that I grew up in a place with very little racism. My schools had people in every class of practically every race and religion. My first school was a Church of England primary school, and we had students there that were Hindu, muslim, jewish, Sikh, it didn\u2019t matter. It was a school run by the church, but all were welcome provided you lived locally. Looking back, it still surprises the hell out of me. \nI\u2019m sure they felt uncomfortable with the multiple school assemblies a week where the local vicar would come down and read from the bible though. He did make an effort to read from the Old Testament a lot though, since that stuff is also in Judaism and islam anyway. Heck, Jesus himself is an important figure in Islam. They don\u2019t believe he was the messiah, but he\u2019s an important figure. One of their most important prophets. And while I was basically an atheist by the age of 8, I appreciate my time at that school. It taught me that humans of different religions and races have far more in common than some people would like us to think. And taught me the true reason racism is referred to as \u201cignorance\u201d",

The one my great-grandmother used when she said it.\n\nEdit: also the reason we append \"-American\" to the nationality of an immigrant is not usually to be US-centric. It's a signal of inclusion, as in \"you may have been born somewhere else but if you now consider the US your home, then you are welcome here and you're one of us.\" It's a reaction to the discrimination and racism that many immigrants face when they arrive here.",

Cultural exchange ***works***\n\nto this day i want to kick my past self for flinching a bit when Kobna shook my hand because i thought his skin felt strangely coarse.\n\n\nstill, good memories",

In highschool, I was friends with a girl who's parents came from India and she was lovely. But POC *strangers* still felt a little weird even though I *obviously* knew that it was just my own brain coming up with weird BS. \n\nLuckily, I moved to a big city and I also happened to move into an area with lots of immigrants. And then I worked with immigrant families and all of that weird shit with my brain just went away. \n\nIt honestly reminds me of the same thing a lot of boys and girls experienced growing up. Girls talked about *boys* do and not just Jack, John, Matthew etc. do. And boys talked about what *girls* like and not just what Kate, Ellie, Rose etc. like. Some never grew out of that. But pretty much everyone who befriended boys *and* girls got out of that way of thinking as soon as they found out that girls can be just as gross, strong and funny as boys and boys can be just as caring, gentle and clean. \n\nWe're all just human on the inside with our own experiences and people really have to interact with others on a regular basis to see that.",

The meetups app has no events in my town, if I decide to drive to a bigger town I\u2019m looking at about a 45 min drive. Also when it comes to classes they are expensive in the town I live in. I\u2019ve already looked, everything is inflated because it\u2019s a tourist place. There aren\u2019t many options.  \n\nAs for sports, I love playing and am a big hockey fan, however someone stole all of my hockey equipment this year and I can\u2019t afford to buy new equipment right now so that\u2019s out of the question. I also need to go to therapy for my ankle that I fractured last year but haven\u2019t been able to afford it, so I can\u2019t really play sports right now on a weak ankle. \n\nI do appreciate everyone\u2019s comments though!",

We\u2019ve all heard an overplayed song we hope we never hear on the radio again, but lots of times we actually don\u2019t like a song at first that we wind up liking on repeat listens.\n\nExpect there will be a learning curve to appreciating media from people who grew up with different experiences, different influences, and different social contexts than the ones you\u2019re familiar with, and persist with the project.

My best friends during my childhood and teens were either black or white depending on the school. So it's surprising to me that I have this hangup now as an adult because I obviously had plenty of exposure to people of other races.

Either way, I can\u2019t stress this enough, that\u2019s okay. \n\nAn ideal society demands that we treat each other with respect and integrity, no matter our differences.

You'll be able to tell \"oh, they're not doing that to be rude or mean, they're doing it because of x\" (for example, most eastern Europeans don't smile all that much, because it feels fake to them. So they're not being grumpy and they're not mad at you, they might actually like you a lot and be happy at the moment, and still not be smiling)\n\nAlso, if you know what to expect and what you're expected to do in response from those guides, you'll feel much, much more comfortable.

As I reached late teens and adulthood, I (thankfully!) realized that the racist and prejudice beliefs instilled into me were harmful, wrong, and abhorrent. I was completely humiliated about how wrong I had been and started a journey of trying to unlearn the hate I had been taught.\n\nI know a lot of people have suggested you \u201cjust\u201d hang out with people of different races, but it\u2019s not that easy if you\u2019re in an area that\u2019s not very diverse or if you don\u2019t know any people of different races. You can\u2019t just go up to a person and be like, \u201cHi, I need a Black friend, want to hang out?\u201d \n\nThe first step is admitting you have a problem, right? And you\u2019ve already done that, so well done! The next step is to delve into what specifically makes you uncomfortable about being around other races and the why behind those feelings. Is it because of things your family has taught you? Is it things you\u2019ve heard about people of that race online or in the news? Is it a nervousness about not being able to understand them if they speak in a different language, or not knowing how to act around people of a different culture? \n\nJournaling  is a great way to dig deeper and processes these feelings. Write the feeling, write the why, and then process where that feeling or belief comes from and whether or not it is based in truth and love or in fear, stereotypes and hatred. \n\nSomething that helped me tremendously was being intentional about watching, listening, and reading things online from people of various races, cultures and nationalities. Not just seeking out entertainers of different races to include into the YouTubers and other online personalities I watched (which I did do!), but seeking out content where topics of race are explored. There\u2019s fantastic videos on YouTube that interview people of color about how they feel about race-specific stereotypes about them and how harmful those perceptions are. There\u2019s tons of interviews of people sharing their experiences of racism. I\u2019ve read and watched tons of history articles and shows regarding the history of those races as well as their modern culture. When you learn where the prejudice and racism comes from historically, it\u2019s easier to realize how unnecessary it is! \n\nLearn as much as you can, and listen to people\u2019s experiences with an open mind and heart. It\u2019ll help shift your views and change your heart over time. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to go befriend someone just because they\u2019re a different race. Trust me, they don\u2019t want someone using them as a learning experience or token friend of color/race. But you can be more open and friendly toward people of different races that you come across naturally in going out, school, work, etc. Work through the discomfort and remember they\u2019re just a person, just like you. Find common ground and similarities. I think you\u2019ll find you have more in common with most people than you expect! The goal isn\u2019t tolerance, the goal is love and acceptance of people not despite their difference, but because of their differences. Deep down we\u2019re all just imperfect humans in need of acceptance and love, just like everyone else, no matter what outward differences we may have. Differences are a good thing. They make each person unique, and because of our differences, we\u2019re all able to bring different ideas and traditions to the table. Like different color threads joined together make a beautiful tapestry. How boring life would be if we all looked, acted, and spoke the same way! \n\nAnd give yourself grace. This is something you\u2019ve learned over time. It\u2019s going to take time to rewire your brain. It\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve made the choice to actively turn from racism and prejudice, but hateful thoughts and prejudices still pop into my mind because it was literally engrained in me as a child. I hate that it happens, but I\u2019ve decided to give myself grace. Because it\u2019s not the thoughts that makes up our characters. It\u2019s what we do with the thoughts that counts. Will we choose to believe those stereotypes or prejudices and act out on them, or will we choose to remind ourselves they\u2019re not true and act out with kindness, empathy, love instead?",

Know that they should be treated equally to you and any other human on this earth.\n\n\nThen take it another step forward and go to resteraunt run by other races, go talk to people of other races, be friendly and remind yourself that they deserve to be treated with the same respect as you.",

I think I put too much thinking into wanting to make sure I wasn't being racist or uncomfortable that I had anxiety about it. But now it doesn't affect me I think just time and having more associations with all different races it becomes more natural",

Just don't act in a negative way while exposing yourself to other people you aren't normally around, and you'll get accustomed to them.\nI was not offended when my teacher explained to me why my classmate was weirded out by me and I was a kid at the time. Honestly, good people will understand and will want to show you a positive example.",

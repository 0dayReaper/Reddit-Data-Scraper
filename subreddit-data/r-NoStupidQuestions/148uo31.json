    "postText": "City I live in, we get quite a lot of homeless. Probably because of anti-homeless infrastructure (not really sure) many of them hangout at really busy intersections where you can\u2019t stop or actually interact with them. There\u2019s no lights and nowhere to pull over and walk to them (it\u2019s a 55 with no shoulder, usually).\n\nI was driving today and had a bag of leftover chips from chipotle I hadn\u2019t touched a burrito. I wasn\u2019t hungry so I didn\u2019t touch it. I saw a homeless man at one of the places mentioned above, no way I could stop or slow down and hazard, people don\u2019t drive smart through there and I\u2019d get hit. \n\nIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve seen them out there pandering for food, and i had a thought a few times, maybe to brake, yell and like underhand toss the food. Aside from the fact it was a burrito and probably wouldnt have survived, would it just come off as really fucked up lol?\n\nI don\u2019t actually see homeless in \u201cconvenient places\u201d in the city and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s fucked reasons for that. But I often have food and stuff leftover from eating at work.\n\nTL;DR can you throw food to homeless when you can\u2019t stop",

    "postText": "Hey all. I recently got dumped by my boyfriend of 4 years, over text no less. We were high school sweethearts and each others first... everything. As expected, this hurts quite a bit. I can't be around people and I can't be alone. This being my first break up, I have no clue where to even begin processing this. All I've been doing is isolating myself so I can cry, accidentally triggering myself with old pictures/memorabilia in an attempt to \"process,\" or just completely blocking the entire situation from my mind. I don't know what to do. The stupidest part of me just wants to beg for him back. He would probably have me. I feel so lost and upset. I'm so tired but I can't sleep. I need any and all advice, please. I just want to move past this as quickly as possible.",

            "comment": "Go ahead and trigger yourself HARD, so you can get the crying out. It's okay, and it's even good to just sob and sob. I cried the week before last so hard I was gulping for air and hoping nobody in the house could hear me! She broke my heart, and I was just not okay. \n\nBut stay sober, don't hurt yourself, and don't isolate. Find someone to talk to--a therapist, friends, people in an online support group. \n\nMake a playlist of meaningful songs, and play them in earbuds when you go for walks. Go ahead and sing along and cry to those, too. \n\nSlowly begin to erase the pictures and messages form your life. Try to make yourself get rid of one or two per day. Even if you can't delete them outright, just upload them to a dropbox or Google folder where you won't see them. I've found that knowing they still exist makes it easier to delete them from my phone so I won't constantly see them when I scroll. Surprisingly, I don't have urges to go to the archival folder and browse there; just knowing they exist seems to free my mind from obsessing about them or needing to see them. \n\nI made an appointment with my doctor, and told him I was depressed due to a breakup. He was able to help by prescribing Trazodone, an antidepressant and also helps me sleep without being a sedative or personality-flattener. \n\nLast but importantly, forgive yourself for how rough it is to heal. Don't guilt trip yourself for spending hours on the couch, or feeling depressed, or writing bad poems, or whatever it is you do. You're wounded; you're not supposed to be functioning at 100%!",

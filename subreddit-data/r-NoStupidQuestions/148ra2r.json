By the time they were living with us two or so months, other friends could bring their pets over too.",

A new pet is introduced, making old pet dislike the \"invader\". Though when my friend brought a kitten in, their dog loved the tiny furball. So, that is to large extent individual-dependent. Typically, introducing kitten to adult dog works smoother. And make sure you pay more attention to \"old\" pet.\n\n2. One might be way more hyper and annoy other by trying to force them to play. So, keep pets' temperaments in mind.",

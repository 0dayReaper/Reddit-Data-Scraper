I've learned quite a bit today!",

When you're folding something vertically, the fold line is on the vertical axis but the actual paper is moving horizontally? I'd probably do hamburger with that instruction honestly since that would mean the paper would open vertically. I promise I'm not as stupid as my spatial reasoning skills make me sound, but I'm just trying to explain why some kids might respond better to hamburger/hot dog or short way/ long way.",

I told my sophomores that if they all got C's or the unit test, we'd spend a period learning how to fold ninja stars out of paper.  \n\nIt was a struggle from the get go:  hotdog vs. hamberder, mountain vs. valley, left vs. right.  \n\nLord.  Have.  Mercy.  \n\nIt made me appreciate how different people could be smart at different things.  The kids who turned in 0 homework assignments had shurikens zipping around the room in no time--making them bigger or smaller, adding patterns with markers.  The kids who book smart had to sit around me watching step by step by step to do it.  There were a few kids who just couldn't do it because their spatial ability was so limited.  \n\nThe dean gave in school suspension to a couple of my kids for ninja fights during the passing period.  In my defense, I told them not to do that.",

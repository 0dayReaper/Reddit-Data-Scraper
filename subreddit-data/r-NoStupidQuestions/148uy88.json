    "postText": "so i have a question, i am preparing for an interview for a clothing store the position is shift supervisor and i feel, like they wont hire person like me who doesn't look good(i have alot of acne and pimples on my face). so is it true, that because of my looks they may reject me after interview?\ncos it's a good brand where they sell high quality clothes. and most of the time i see people working in store like this a beautiful/handsome. \nwhat are you thoughts on this?",

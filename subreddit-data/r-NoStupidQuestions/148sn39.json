    "postText": "So cats are induced ovulators, and as far as my understanding goes, this means they have to have sex to ovulate. Meaning they never 'waste' an egg like women do every time we have our periods. \nSo what's the deal with that?",

            "comment": "Because different species have evolved different reproductive strategies based on their ecological and physiological adaptations. Induced ovulation is a reproductive strategy in which ovulation occurs in response to specific stimuli, such as mating. \n\n\nSpontaneous Ovulation (as observed in humans, and most other mammals) has become an evolutionary benefit because it provides increased reproductive opportunities by allowing for potential conception during each reproductive cycle, maximizing the chances of successful reproduction. Plus, it offers enhanced reproductive flexibility, enabling females to mate and potentially conceive during their fertile period, adapting to uncertain conditions. Additionally, it can reduce competition between males and allow for female choice. Lastly, it also encourages paternal investment, as males can recognize and respond to the timing of female fertility (responding to changes hormones/pheromones) which encourages not only mating, but also to increased care and support for offspring.",

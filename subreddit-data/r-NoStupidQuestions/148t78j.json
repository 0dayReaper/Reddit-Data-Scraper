            "comment": "SSRI\u2019s and drugs such as MDMA or Cocaine have very different mechanisms of actions as they are processed by your body. \n\n\nIllegal drugs like cocaine and MDMA act on specific neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopamine and serotonin. These drugs rapidly increase the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to an immediate euphoric effect. By directly enhancing the release or inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin, they induce a rapid surge of these neurotransmitters, producing intense feelings of pleasure, euphoria, and heightened mood.\n\n\nIn contrast, SSRIs, which are commonly prescribed antidepressants, work by selectively blocking the reuptake of serotonin in the brain. They do not cause an immediate increase in serotonin levels. Instead, it takes time for the drug to accumulate and modulate the serotonin system, leading to therapeutic effects.\n\n\nThe delayed onset of action of SSRIs is primarily due to the adaptive changes that occur in the brain's neurotransmitter systems over time. When serotonin reuptake is blocked by SSRIs, it triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular changes that eventually lead to increased serotonin availability at the synapses. It takes time for the brain to adjust to the altered serotonin levels and for the downstream effects to manifest as an improvement in mood and alleviation of symptoms associated with depression or anxiety.\n\n\nAlso,  SSRIs not only modulate serotonin levels but also have broader effects on neuroplasticity and synaptic connectivity, which contribute to their therapeutic effects but also require time to take effect.",

                            "comment": "Yes, SSRIs do technically increase serotonin levels immediate, but the immediate increase is not nearly as significant as the surge seen with illicit drugs like cocaine or MDMA. \n\n\nAdditionally, the mechanism of action plays a large role in this. If you don\u2019t know, the term \u201cMechanism of Action\u201d refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect. \n\n\nIt can be difficult to wrap your head around this concept without a fundamental understanding of chemistry/medicine, but to put it simply, drugs like cocaine and MDMA cause a quick and powerful increase in the amount of serotonin in the brain. They work by directly affecting the release and reuptake of serotonin. They make the brain release a lot of serotonin all at once, flooding the brain with a large amount of this chemical. \n\n\nWhereas SSRI\u2019s work by helping the brain keep serotonin around for longer. Normally, after serotonin does its job, it gets taken back up into the brain cells through a process called reuptake. But SSRIs block this reuptake (SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). So the serotonin stays in the spaces between the brain cells for a bit longer. This allows the serotonin to keep sending its messages and potentially help improve our mood over time.\n\n\nI hope that this helps you to better understand the difference between the two!",

It sounds like you are saying that the increase is so small that it doesn't cause any effect on mood? and I guess therefore the improvements some people see on SSRIs are due to downstream effects.",

While this can be very fun, too much serotonin can also have a very dangerous and immediate impact on your nervous system. \n\n\nWhen too many serotonin receptors are activated (by taking too much MDMA or mixing it with other drugs that increase serotonin levels), it can cause the nervous system to become overactive and can lead to a serious condition called Serotonin Syndrome. Symptoms include confusion, rapid heart rate, high body temperature, muscle stiffness, sweating, hallucinations, and even seizures in severe cases. If the body temperature becomes extremely high or if seizures are prolonged, it can lead to organ damage, including permanent damage to the brain, heart, and kidneys. Severe cases can also result in cardiovascular collapse or the failure of vital organs.\n\n\nSerotonin Syndrome is a serious condition that usually requires medical attention. Doctors will provide treatment to manage the symptoms and restore the balance of serotonin in the brain. Fortunately, if identified early enough &amp; treated appropriately, it can be resolved without long-term or permanent damage. \n\n\nTake it from me, though, Serotonin Syndrome is NOT FUN. It can be so easy to take large amounts of MDMA/Molly  in the moment, because you\u2019re feeling so great and you don\u2019t want feeling to end. But my goodness - when you can\u2019t stop rolling and you\u2019re experiencing these symptoms, the experience turns into a nightmare. It happened to me one time, and the experience stopped me from ever partaking in said drugs ever again.",

If I had and I was wrong, I\u2019d be getting shit about being a stupid American rather than ethnocentric (which is the correct terminology, not egocentric, you\u2019re welcome come back any time for some assistance). No winning with you asshats. \n\n\n\nYes I realize that strict 9-5 schedules are largely outdated. That was not the question, however. I did, however, answer the question. Which was \u201cwhat is a 925\u201d.\n\nI, too, find the subreddit /r/boneappletea amusing. Hadn\u2019t heard of the \u201cFlorida ceiling\u201d one. Cracked me up.

Does your hair salon let you tip on the card? \nMine only allows cash tips\u2026 $200 is easy to figure but when it\u2019s not a round number and you also have to tip the hair washer my head starts spinning \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab maybe I\u2019m just bad at math lol",

But her hiring that person benefitted her, not me, and I\u2019m already paying more for it than when it was just her. As such, for just a basic shampoo, I\u2019ll usually tip $5-$7.",

My wife has more stuff done and has bills of $130-$185 and I think she tips 15%. At the places we go, the stylist does the wash. Most of the time I walk there right after a shower, so she doesn\u2019t do the wash at all.",

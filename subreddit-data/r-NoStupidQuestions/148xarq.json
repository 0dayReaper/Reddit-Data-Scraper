    "postText": "Hello. Not sure where to ask this question so I figured here was the best place. I\u2019m getting drug tested for a the job mentioned above, what I want to know is even if I fail, can they deny me employment? Weed is legal in New York State and I read that they can\u2019t deny employment for marijuana use. Can I still get denied if I failed since it\u2019s a medical job? Is there any way to pass? Please help\n\nEdit: getting tested in a couple days",

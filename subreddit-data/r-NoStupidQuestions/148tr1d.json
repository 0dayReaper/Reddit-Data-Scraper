    "postText": " So I've been redecorating my room into my dream room for a few weeks now and I'm going for an apartment aesthetic and everything is going well and I of course ask for permission before putting any up or setting anything up but my folks told me it had to be illegal to put a doorbell outside my room door.\n\nI was bummed out because it would've been cute and useful since knocking on the door is like slapping a  screaming otter.\n\nSo I need to know, is it really illegal ? I had a feeling it wasn't but I wanna make sure they can't call the cops on me",

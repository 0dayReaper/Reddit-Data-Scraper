    "postText": "So my husband and have a house that was built 2 years ago, so everything is brand new. Builder did not put enough freon in the ac at installation, so it was freezing over on the outside pipe by last summer. We used an ac repair company. They fixed the issue last year, but ac started freezing over about a month ago again. Same repair company came out on 5/19 and supposedly \"fixed\" it. They replaced a cap that they believe wasn't fitted properly and allowing leakage.\n  Our ac unit started freezing over again last week. I contacted repair company who never mailed us a bill. They claimed they sent it to email but we never received it.  They want payment in order to come out again to look at the unit.So just yesterday they sent it. Now we are Having lowes come out to fix it. Should we pay the first repair company even though their work didn't even last 3 weeks?",

Description:

Ask away!

Rules:

Top level comments must be an answer/followup question.: All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed. (Link only responses are permitted if they are asking for a subreddit.)

Do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should "google it." Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself.

Please try searching the subreddit for your question first: Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index).

Follow reddiquette: Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

No medical advice questions: No medical advice questions

No trolling or joke questions: Disallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. 

No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions: Suicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.

Questions along the lines of "was I raped?" or "was I sexually assaulted?" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/wiki/resources#wiki_rape_and_sexual_violence) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/wiki/help).

No self-promotion, shilling or begging: No trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. 

Asking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. 

No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter: Nothing like "Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

No disguised rants, agenda posts or potstirring: Other questions not asked in good faith - such as putting a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question. Any questions we suspect of being leading questions or asked merely to promote an agenda or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) will be removed.

    "postText": "Recently (5 day before this incident) my hormonal IUD of four years got misplaced so I had to get it pulled out. Standard procedure, it was lodged, but still came out completely.\n\nCut 5 days later, He took a shower and jacked off. After the fact he came into the room and we started to fool around. I idiotically put the tip in for three seconds before realizing that \"Oh shit. I no longer have an IUD\" and quickly put a condom on. \n\nI now am panicking + ovulating and feel like an idiot. I understand pregnancy COULD happen, but what is the likelihood? \n\n(I hate people who say \"You seen young/don't understand\" but in reality I'm having a oh shit i'm 25 and NOT ready for kids yet moment.)",

No hummus? \n\n(Like how if you\u2019re allergic to nuts then it\u2019s basically all nuts) \n\nAlso this is sponsored by TikTok teaching me that green peas are legumes.",

Legumes are a big plant family and peanuts are kind of their own things. As an analogy, if chickpeas, lentils, and beans were wolves, dogs, and coyotes, peanuts would be foxes. Similar, but also not as closely related to the other ones.",

Apparently it's equally if not more common for them to be allergic to other nuts than to other legumes. That doesn't make much sense, because grouping tree nuts and peanuts is an arbitrary human thing and has nothing to do with the properties of the plants, but allergies don't make a lot of sense in general--still very poorly understood territory in medicine.",

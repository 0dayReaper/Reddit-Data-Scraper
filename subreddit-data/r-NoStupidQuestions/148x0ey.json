    "postText": "I'm mostly talking about US created shows because I know a magority of anime is created outside the US. It seems that all the movies that have been coming out for kids are all CGI stuff or live-action remakes. I don't really remember the last time Disney had an animated movie, it's all been CGI or live-action. Have people forgotten how to draw or is it not being taught anymore? I found this on YouTube, it's how the cartoon version of The Lion King was created and it looked like so much work, time and effort was put into it. The remake was flat to me, didn't like it. Cool fake animals but it was just flat, like AI art. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFL5xbxc0AY",

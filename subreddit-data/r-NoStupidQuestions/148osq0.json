    "postText": "I recently went from a 36\" waist to 32\". Halff a dozen pair of Levis, too good to throw away, could at least do for gardening. But even with a belt they fall down.\n\nI'm thinking about slicing the waistband at the left and right hip and gluing them together with a 2\" overlap each side. Is there a better way that doesn't require sewing skills?",

If you are doing it by hand it's going to make your fingers ache, if you are using a machine go slowly and use the right needle.  You may break parts of your machine.  \n\n1.  You want to make [darts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9x-i-txyfo) either one over the middle seam in the back or three smaller darts.  Pin this first and try them on and adjust then repeat until you're happy with the fit.  You can adjust the angle that allows room for your hips and butt to continue to fit.  \n2. If you want to keep the back pockets usable, you could make 3 smaller darts (at 3 6 and 9 o'clock looking down on the waist).  \n3. You can trim the excess folded material after you've finished the darting stitch.  This will make the darts permanent so you can't let them out later if you want a 36\" waist.  \n4. If you want to keep any belt loops, remove them first and sew them back on later (you may want to remove nearby beltloops to even out the spacing).",

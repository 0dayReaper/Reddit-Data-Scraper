I have a job, I proceed to use my own money at earned at my job from working \u201cx\u201d number of hours to get myself something to eat, as I often can go a few days at a time without eating because enough is never cooked for lil of us. My father get mad because I didn\u2019t get them anything, my father is never home everyday and my mother only comes home late at night, she\u2019ll often pick up something for herself to eat, which logically makes sense. I used to order stuff for my mother but my father would go through the kitchen and eat what I got for her like he did last week when she went looking for something I got her the day before. My parents occasionally cook however there is never enough cooked for all of us, meaning that I almost never get to eat anything because  \u201cI and your mom eat before you\u201d, which results in me ordering something.\n\nIt used to be, \u201ccan we get (restaurant name) and \u201cdo you have (restaurant name money)\u201d, and now I do",

I'm sorry your parents are so selfish, just know you can be free of them someday if you choose, and if you truly feel as if you are being starved then turn them into the authorities. You don't owe them misery.",

You starve yourself for days because they never have enough food for you?\n\nThat's some serious neglect, my dude. I don't know how old you are but it's not right for any parent to withhold food from their child. \n\nTell your father that since they don't have enough to feed you, you're feeding yourself. Though I doubt he'll make the connection to his own behavior.",

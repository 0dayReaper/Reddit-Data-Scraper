Things along the lines of:\n\nWhat specific types of volunteer experience should you have prior to applying?\nAre there skills that will help you stand out more in comparison to other applicants?\nHow long does the process take? And is there a good time to apply that is better than others?\n\nEdit: added more clarity to the question.\nEdit: \u2026\u2026 I do feel slightly stuuupi\u2026. about spelling it wrong. And even moreso that I can\u2019t update the title\u2026.",

Those were the go-to jeans for low-rise because their zippers were like 1.5-2\" long, and their pockets were the same. Jeans were great for HS girls who wanted some barely above their pubic mound, not so great for pockets.",

When you have no pockets you are kind of forced to carry a bag with you wherever you go. A retailer can sell a pair of pants for $30, but their purses are like $50; more money for them. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but in my head it sort of makes a lot of sense",

I feel like I rarely ever notice women carry them any more, at least younger women, so even if it is all a big conspiracy to get women to buy purses, from my point of view that strategy doesn't seem to be working.",

In the 1950s I believe there was actually a movement for women to have pockets on their pants lmao this all sounds silly but did you know on average women's pockets are around 48% smaller than men's!!! That's why there's still purses and handbags. I'm not saying it's to oppress women but I think it may have started out that way.",

Bigger problem is there's no overarching standard, so brands have different measurements from eachother.\n\nSince form fitting is more important in women's clothing than men's, optimal sizing would probably need waste, hip, thigh and length measurements compared to men's, which just use waist and length.  I'm sure many women would appreciate this, but having worked with the general public, I think most people would view this as more confusing than helpful, but I'm not in that industry so that's just speculation.",

I just wear men\u2019s clothes because of the pockets and easy sizing.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying it would be perfect. I\u2019m saying that using real measurements and more than one measurement would at least improve the ease of women\u2019s sizing. Jesus.",

Well, women in general would need at least one added measurement - hips. But even that's not enough because for some women, the widest part of their hips is up high, some it's lower.  And some women have a prominent butt, some a flatter one. Some have thicker thighs relative to their other measurements, some thinner, etc etc.  \n\nI wear skirts to avoid all this nonsense :)",

Whereas with women, waist, hips and legs seem to vary a lot more, even when they have a similar weight. Same with chests. 'Average' sized men have similar chest sizes, but 'average' women  can have small or huge breasts, making it difficult to size.  \n\n\nI'm the same height as my mom, but I weigh about 10% more than her. However, her hips are quite a bit wider, so she wears pants a waist size larger than me.  \n\n\nThis is in no way factual, but your question made me think, and this is the only logical answer I can suggest.",

Also, maybe clothing companies need to hire a few engineers and origami experts to figure out how to put pockets in clothes for more clothing variety, but that's my highly unpopular opinion.",

Plus it's often not a concious decision. You buy something that looks good and you go home and want to put something in your pocket and there are none. \n\nWalking around looking for items is tiring, most people don't want to spend an incredible amount of time shopping. Majority of consumers don't make fully informed decisions because it would be absolutely exhausting to remember everything we need to remember any time we buy things. So we act as we would normally and then are unhappy when we get something other than we were expecting. Of course it's possible to only buy clothes that specifically have pockets, just as it's possible to avoid Chinese goods or get only cruelty free items, but it would be exhausting and very time consuming to do any of those with everything we buy. Most consumers buy what is offered to them and looks best in the instant they are at the store, whether it's something with an unnecessary amount of plastic packaging, a cheap gadget that won't work well, clothes without pockets/ with incredibly itchy labels or anything else. Pushing the blame on consumers for falling for the tricks meant to get more money from us at our cost is just reinforcing that any company can do anything they want as long as it sells. And that certainly is realistic. It's also a very popular view, but I wish people realised that humans, including them, need certain level of convenience especially with everyday things, and that it's just not reasonable for the consumer to keep the guard up all the time.",

My suit didn't have a phone sized pocket so I got to carry a notebook and papers and go to my office for research. It's not really a good look to walk into the gallery of a courtroom with a visible cellphone so I couldn't just carry it. Very frustrating",

I found surprise pockets in the majority of things I rented. I think it was the extra care going into sewing those items + the better quality fabric. Flattering with pockets IS possible, but probably not attainable for most \u201cmall stores\u201d (which is where I get the clothes I actually own)",

They are literally the worst bag format for carrying anything. Even if it had nothing in it its still such and awkward thing to carry. \n\nUnfortunately if you're not a student or young, backpacks aren't really very fashionable. For me, denim jackets are the answer since they often have big inside pockets.",

Further, bridal designers have also installed pockets in their gowns, as my team and I have seen an increase in, recently. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s less of a market for larger pockets for women in other types of clothing because:\n\na: they generally carry a bag or a purse with them, negating the need for functional pockets.\n\nb: the tighter fit of women\u2019s jeans and pants cause a noticeable line that is considered undesirable.\n\nI\u2019ve closed the pocket openings and removed the internal fabric from countless pants and jeans in my time, and each time the sentiment is the same. \u201cI\u2019ll never use them, and they\u2019re useless anyway.\u201d\n\nAlso, there is an entire subtype of lingerie that give only bare coverage where needed so they can simply not show undergarment lines under their clothing - i.e. Thongs.\n\nObviously if women had larger pockets, they wouldn\u2019t feel the need to carry bags as much. But it\u2019s my understanding as a career tailor that these are the two major answers.",

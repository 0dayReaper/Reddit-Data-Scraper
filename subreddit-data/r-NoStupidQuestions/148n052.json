English is a dumb language that often feels like it's intentionally designed to be as difficult as possible to get right. \n\nYou do get used to it, and eventually have a \"feel\" for what sounds right, but that makes it really hard to explain *why* something is right.",

You know it\u2019s chaotic nonsense but you feel like you\u2019re in on it so you enjoy it.\n\nI usually don\u2019t know how to pronounce a word until I hear it and get it pretty quickly after that. But people are pretty forgiving on rare and commonly mispronounced words. The weirdest part is when I take foreign language classes. The Chinese teacher tells me there\u2019s tones in English and I don\u2019t believe her until I sit there pronouncing words wrong for a bit.",

However, I can certainly appreciate the complexities some of our words have e.g. there / their / they're. I can also understand that many of our idioms that form part of every day conversations must be very confusing for non native English speaking people.",

English feels innate to me, and I don't often struggle with it. But I definitely do notice the weird things. I'm honestly glad I'm a native English speaker, because trying to learn it must be so daunting.",

When you get right down to it, spelling isn't really that important. We all laugh at the pictures of horribly misspelled signs, but we still know exactly what they're trying to communicate. So in a sense even that is mission accomplished.",

Even though cough and tough are spelled nearly the same (and this is just one example), I never stumble over it. \n\nThen I had kids, and trying to teach them how to read really made me hate English. I was aware of the inconsistency before that, but it's really frustrating when every single rule that you think you know about phonetics is wrong more often than not.",

The words \"rough\" and \"tough\" are pronounced the same way, but \"bough\" and \"dough\" are completely different.  The letter \"c\" can sound like a \"k\" or an \"s\" depending on which word it's in.  English must be so, so difficult to learn when it's not your first language.",

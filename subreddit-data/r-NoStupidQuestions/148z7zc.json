I noticed that there are sometimes comments that seem like they're posted by someone else, but it says OP next to their message. Like, there will be a comment asking the OP \"why would you do that?\" not as a response to any previous comment, and it says OP. \n\nIs it someone using alt accounts to argue with themself on their post? Does the comment history get screwy when the OP deletes everything? I just don't understand it.",

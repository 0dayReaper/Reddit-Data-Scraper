The algorithm delivers videos to your feed that you\u2019re actually likely to be interested in. Mine, for example, includes videos of dogs, history, science, coding, makeup, fashion, and FL hiking/exploration. \n\n\nI like to compare TikTok to 2006-2009 YouTube. Back then, I\u2019d watch a video and just click on the related videos until a few hours have passed. It\u2019s a lot like that. TilTok is full of interesting and captivating videos, and it\u2019s not hard to spend an hour or two watching a bunch of random videos on miscellaneous topics that their algorithm believes you\u2019d enjoy (based off of videos you\u2019ve previously watched/liked on the app).",

In an effort to slow its rival in the social media war, they paid a major consulting firm (Targeted Victory) to paint TikTok in a bad light. Obviously, it worked pretty well. \n\n\nIt\u2019s always best to form your own opinions based off of your own judgement. Media can be very difficult to trust 100% - as it\u2019s not unusual (in Western culture) for stories/opinions to be funded &amp; pushed to the masses. Yay. :) Isn\u2019t it great? :) :)",

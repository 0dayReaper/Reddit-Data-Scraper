    "postText": "Case in point, _Diablo 4_.  A number of my console friends say they can't play online because they aren't subbed to PS Plus and XBox Live. However, they're still able to play locally because PS and XBox allow them to use their internet connections to access Blizzard's servers.\n\nHow, then, is it legal to force people to pay $10-$20 a month to play games they've fully purchased, on consoles they've fully purchased, using their own internet connections, to reach someone else's servers. How does that make sense?\n\n---\n\n**EDIT:** I thought this was the one sub you could ask questions without having to defend them, but for the record: **I'M ON A PC** (well, a Steam Deck). This is a genuine question from a non-console gamer who doesn't understand why you might be required to sub for their service to play games that run off other companies' servers.",

And there's commonly other benefits as well.\n\nAs for legality, what do you think is illegal about it? Their matchmaking servers don't run for free, and they may indeed be hosting servers for the online matches to run on when played on th3ir systems as well.",

                    "comment": "_Are_ they running on their matchmaking servers, though?\n\nFor in-house games (say, _Spiderman_), I can see it. But for games from houses like Blizzard, that have all their own servers, what are Sony or MS actually doing in that equation.\n\nI dunno, it just seems illegal (or at least highly unethical) to force players to pay for something they clearly don't even need (since, again, you can still play D4 without a sub, and you need to go online to Blizz's servers to do it).",

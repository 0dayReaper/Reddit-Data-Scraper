I'll drop the link in. It's an interesting video. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gybTMf_Xa10\n\nAymara language @ 5:24",

I remember when I was 5 and had recently learned about years (what year it is now and which one would be the next etc), once before sleep I tried to count: how old will I be in such-and-such year? When I reached the year when I would be 10, I thought: that's too far into the future, anything after that seemed like \"in the next life\", and I slept. The older you get, the faster time seems to pass; now four or five years is not that large of a time. I guess for old people time flows really fast. So, the younger the child, the slower times goes in his perception, and when going back we approach the moment of birth, perceived time should go infinitely slow (as in relativistic time dilation), so the perceived moment of time of birth is negative infinity. We feel like we have always existed.",

He spent time with people who had terminal illnesses and found that actually many of them accepted death and felt that a lot of life's pressures were released when they came to grips with the fact that they were going to die. I appreciate that that doesn't directly relate to your comment and it's something I'd thought about, but do agree with you!\n\nIn fact thinking on it, it's a big reason as to why I'm vegetarian. It gives me anxiety thinking of how it must feel for an animal to be in the position you described (for however long) being trapped and resigned to knowing that you're being killed. It's the helplessness of the situation.\n\nI suppose it's an argument for assisted dying, having the actual control over it.",

It's not different or scary to think that you'll have to not-exist in the future. And if there is an \"afterlife\" (more than just non-existence) then you've probably already experienced it.\n\nAnother recent episode (I think it was [Local Natives](http://youmadeitweird.nerdistind.libsynpro.com/local-natives), but I could be wrong), someone retold an anecdote of someone's toddler having a moment alone with their baby sibling, with the parents listening in secretly. When the kid thought they were alone, they asked the younger sibling, \"Where were you before? I'm starting to forget!\" (or something very close to that)\n\nSo, yeah. Trippy. Beforelife? Who knows!",

It's a much bigger problem for the people who are still alive and missing loved ones, which I think is why an afterlife is such a common belief. There might be nothing in the world scarier/sadder than the thought of never seeing the people you love again, and the afterlife is such a perfect remedy for that.",

Without wondering what's before or after (our personal experience, if we could be there to witness it), I'm interested in the thing from another point of view - how is life created? Cells grow exponentially and the physical aspect of creatures growing is obvious, but what exactly brings the life into the chunks of meat that we animals are?\n\nDeath is a lot easier to grasp. There is life, which then ceases to exist, nothing is forever, yada yada. But new life? Like I said, the physical aspect is easy, we transform and utilize various resources (such as energy) to create the shell, but where does the consciousness come from?\n\nIt sure is possible that our consciousness is literally just a fine tuned mixture of electricity and genetic programming (which is supported by the theories that there's no free will, all our impulses etc are hard coded into our dna). Who knows, maybe we really are just biological computers and creating life is just putting some electricity into that computer to get the 1s and 0s flowing. So, maybe life never really comes from anywhere special, nor does it go anywhere special. It would just be another manifestation of physics.",

If there are theological arguments for existing before you were born, they don't really matter to people because we can't relate to that stuff. You have no drive to believe in life before conception. \n\nBut after existing for 70 or 80 years, after acquiring all sorts of experience and memories and connections that you desperately don't want to lose, the thought of having to lose it all forever and go back to not existing is just too hard to bear. So there's a strong drive to believe in a life after death that somehow preserves all the good things about living and removes all the bad things about living. And, of course, there's a strong drive to believe in a life after death that punishes those who deserve punishment and rewards those who deserve reward.\n\n*That's* why people always ask where we go after death but no one\\* ever asks where we were before we were born and had a consciousness.\n\n\\* It's not strictly *no one.* There are people who believe in existence before conception. But, yeah, most people I know never give a thought to the possibility of life before conception.",

Scriptures like Revelation 12:9 -  And the great dragon was \u200b\u200b\u200bcast out\u200b, that old serpent, called the \u200b\u200b\u200bDevil\u200b, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.",

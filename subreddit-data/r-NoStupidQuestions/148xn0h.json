So this hypothetical kid would get half from one parent and half from the other, but it's unlikely to be like... the exact opposite halves.\n\nHumans have 23 pairs of chromosomes but let's say you just have 3\n\nyou and you clone have Aa Bb Cc, this offspring might end up with AA BB CC, aa bb cc, AA bb cc, etc.\n\n\n---\n\nEdit: some plants can self-pollinate but they won't be the exact same because of these reasons, just to make it not about humans since people are focusing on the impossibility of how this would actually happen.\n\nAnd there are other ways to get genetic variation as well such as crossing over.",

Two clones would still produce a unique baby, as at least some of our chromosomes contain differing pairs of genes.  These genes can supersede one another if one is dominant, or combine to give different expressions if both are co-dominant or co-recessive.  You'd just come away with a kid that's at higher risk of developing genetic illnesses that you might be carrying.\n\nLike that idiot Mary and her typhoid.",

            "comment": "If you can reproduce with them, they aren't an exact clone of you, obviously, since an exact clone would be of the same sex as you. If we imagine this is a clone that's identical except having your dad's other sex chromosome (so identical to you except a Y chromosome instead of the second X or vice versa), then no, the offspring would not be identical to either of you, and would have a high probability of birth defects.\n\nYou have to consider that you have two copies of every gene you have--one from your mother and one from your father. When you have a child, they inherit a random mix of those genes, so of the genes they inherit from you, some will be your father's copy and some will be your mother's copy.\n\nYou and your opposite sex clone have the same exact pool of genes to randomly pull from, but what gets randomly pulled to be contributed to the child will be different between the two of you. Say you have brown hair, inherited from your dad, but your mother was blond and you also carry a copy of the recessive blond hair gene from her. Well, if you and your clone both pass down your mother's copy of that gene, the child will have two copies of the recessive gene, and will thus have blond hair even though you and your clone both have brown hair.\n\nThe big problem this introduces is that humans often carry recessive genes where, if you have just one copy of it, it causes no problems, but if you have two copies of it, birth defects result. If you have any of those, there is a 25% chance your clone and you will both pass down the bad recessive gene and your child will get the birth defect. This is the reason incest causes birth defects, and if two almost genetically identical people reproduce, the probability would be extremely high.",

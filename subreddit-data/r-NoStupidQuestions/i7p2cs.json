    "postText": "Basically why isn't euthanasia legal? Why would we rather someone killed themselves in more or less violent ways, rather than letting them die in their sleep and in a controlled setting? What are the arguments against this?\n\n\nEdit: Well wow this definitely blew up. First of all thank you to everyone who gave me awards, I'm not sure what they are but it's still really nice receiving them haha.\n\nWhile I couldn't read all the replies, I gathered that the main arguments against euthanasia are money and the fear that people would take advantage of it, as well as religion.\nFor those wondering, I'm from Italy and well here the problem is definitely religion. But we did have a very talked about case a while ago where a paraplegic guy was helped to die by his friend. The friend went to trial for this but in the end, he was found not guilty.\n\nAnyway, thank you to everyone who replied, best wishes to all :)",

It\u2019s gross.\n\nAt any rate, I generally support in concept but those are the most valid concerns I\u2019ve heard on Capitol Hill over the years.",

As an American I wonder if the reason euthanasia has been so strongly fought is the amount of money that would be lost by nursing homes, pharma, and other long term care facilities. \n\nThese are two separate issues that need to be tackled. Unfortunately, avoiding massive crippling debt that would burden loved ones beyond the loss of someone they care about is a valid reason to consider euthanasia. The broken medical payment system in the US is not a reason to force more suffering onto someone and their families.",

There is really a subset of the population that just feels differently. I always have about 25%-35% of students in every class that just do not want to die at all costs. The thought of death scares them so much that they would literally prolong life even if it's painful, expensive, and ultimately they know it's just a bit of a longer life.\n\nOther students feel that cost isn't as important as quality of life. That many would choose this due to pain at the time of death.\n\nIn order to choose this option now (In some states) it has to be made by the patient who is diagnosed by 2 independent physicians as terminal and they have to be of sound mind. Otherwise we do get in to some other issues with family motives. Many people do not want to consider these options long before they are actually needed as they are \"morbid\" which complicates things.\n\nOne of the greatest amounts of expenditures are in the last 6 months of life. Why are we doing so very many tests, procedures, etc etc when really it has little value to quality and often quantity of life. It's just putting money in the healthcare pocket.",

That strikes me as such a weird concept but I see this mindset all the time. There does seem to be a strange idea that we live forever, that death somehow is the unnatural part, but living on a machine and a cocktail of medicine is more natural than death. Is it fear you think? I always summed it up to people being too dumb to understand that all things die and humans aren\u2019t special. But I have been accused of being cynical before lol. The fear thing is interesting, people are terrified....typing this out now it makes perfect sense! Don\u2019t know why I never really put it together like that!",

When you\u2019re gone you\u2019re *gone*, and there\u2019s no shiny paradise or similar waiting for you. And while the real world sucks sometimes, as long as you\u2019re alive then it can always get better given enough time. But once you\u2019re dead then that\u2019s it. Even if your score is in the negatives now the only way to reach that high-score board is to keep playing.\n\n2) There\u2019s *so much* out there. So many foods I haven\u2019t tasted, books I haven\u2019t read, games I haven\u2019t played, sights I haven\u2019t seen, thoughts I haven\u2019t thought yet. So many that it\u2019s literally impossible to do them all, even if I wasn\u2019t the type of person who liked to take my time about it. And that\u2019s just on this planet alone; look up at the skies and think about how much there could be out there in that expanse of eternity, in the *eons* of time still to come! As a person who grew up on a diet of fantasy and sci-fi I *want* that, even if I have to wait forever for it to come about, and for that I can\u2019t be dead.\n\nWhich of course doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not for allowing people the option to do it, though I\u2019d mourn their decision. I do think that beyond the listed requirements above I\u2019d also push for a \u201cof sound mind\u201d type one, because elsewise you get into cases where a bad diagnosis becomes the straw that breaks the mental camels back, regardless of said person\u2019s actual chances.",

This life is amazing BECAUSE of all of the possibilities. \n\nI also feel as if there is nothing after this life.  The funny thing about my feelings on this is I didn't decide this one day and that was that. I didn't purposefully decide to be atheist, and if pressed I would say I'm more agnostic than atheist.  I personally wished I could convince myself that there is an after life, but without a preponderance of evidence, I just think that it goes black when you die. And that's sad, and scary, to me.  \n\nI really hope that as I age, I can learn to accept, with dignity, entering the void. I'm of the mindset that, like wisdom, this grace will be hard earned through years of experiences, and not something that you either have or don't. I hope anyway.",

I can't imagine anyone opting to end their own lives without serious and deeply profound beliefs that life is absolutely no longer an option for them.\n\nInstead,  we couldn't let my dad have the honor of making his own choices, and prevented him the dignity of letting his last days be on his terms. In the end,  he had multiple strokes,  a solid DNR, and starved himself in a hospital bed, clenching his mouth shut to prevent any water or medication from being administered. \n\nIt was absolutely awful, and his frustration has stuck with me, even 3 years later.",

It\u2019s gross.\n\nIt's gross, but it's a legitimate reason all the same. You'd need more than that to get a Dr. to approve MAD, at any rate. They don't just let people off themselves for addressable reasons. When left reserved for the terminally ill or people with objectively terrible QOL the chances of someone abusing it are pretty low.",

I\u2019m tired. I can usually force myself out of bed to go to work with the understanding that I\u2019d be in the street otherwise, but little everyday things that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal at all can ruin my whole day and make me furious for hours, often fading to deep sadness at my circumstances. It often feels like my cognition is degrading over time, like I can\u2019t remember or think nearly as well as I used to just a few years ago, but I haven\u2019t ever done any hard drugs. I wish I didn\u2019t have to do any of it at all anymore. I can\u2019t imagine living with so much chronic anger and unhappiness for the many years I have left and sometimes I feel like eventual suicide is somewhat inevitable, almost like I know it\u2019s how I\u2019ll die. A medically induced death sounds far more dignified than blowing my brains out, if I\u2019m just going to kill myself either way. I realize my problems aren\u2019t as bad as someone who lives in constant physical pain or something, though. \n\nI\u2019m ok right now and I don\u2019t have any immediate plans to kill myself. This isn\u2019t me reaching out for help or for someone to talk to, I just feel I have some relevant thoughts to share as it pertains to me. For me, I don\u2019t need to rush into suicide. If I really want to do it, I\u2019ll want to do it later, too, and I have the privilege of simply being able to wait to do it until then. I\u2019d definitely at least want to get all my affairs in order first. Maybe one day I won\u2019t feel this way at all. Mostly it\u2019s the people I know that have kept me here so far. I don\u2019t want to make them sad, but at the same time, it might be best overall if I didn\u2019t force myself to live a life of dissatisfaction just for them. Whenever someone with a terminal illness passes, someone will remark without fail that \u201cAt least they aren\u2019t suffering anymore.\u201d I feel that same sentiment should be extended to anyone who decides they\u2019re done with life\u2019s struggles, regardless of background, because life truly is hard and for some, it\u2019s just too much. \n\nPersonally, I feel like people should be free to get an assisted suicide for literally whatever reason they want, or even none in particular. Maybe not one on the spot, but after a predetermined amount of time, if someone is still interested in ending things, they can come in for the procedure. There are other reasons that people consider suicide for than just physical or mental malady. There\u2019s also financial hardship, loneliness, an insurmountable past, old age, and many more. \n\nThe problem with how things are currently set up is that not being eligible for assisted suicide isn\u2019t going to deter anyone who\u2019s truly determined (and it hasn\u2019t in the past), which places the methodology on the victim. If done wrong, the attempt may lead to a slow and agonizing death, or a severe injury and a failed attempt. After failing a suicide attempt, someone may be left permanently disfigured, disabled, and with even worse circumstances than before, but now also without the ability to try again by themselves. Some people call suicide \u201cselfish,\u201d but the only thing that I can see that is selfish is expecting someone to live a life they aren\u2019t happy with just so that you can continue to enjoy their company. People might also see it as running from your problems, but it\u2019s your body, your life and you shouldn\u2019t be compelled to do the things that bring you misery, even if it might be \u201cbetter\u201d in the end to face them and potentially overcome them. I\u2019m not sure I could be convinced otherwise at this point. If you don\u2019t want to have to face them, fine. That shouldn\u2019t be anyone else\u2019s concern. \n\nMy bottom line is that even if assisted suicide isn\u2019t available to the people who don\u2019t have a quality-of-life-altering ailment, at the very least it should be available everywhere to those who do. Sorry for the wall, though.",

Obviously, suicide isn\u2019t a good thing when it could possibly have been prevented, so people would do what they can to try to steer people away from that decision more effectively than they\u2019re doing now. If quality of life can be made even marginally better for those in need, I bet it would save at least a few lives. In a world where suicide was something you could just sign up for, I bet there would be tons of programs created for the sole purpose of helping people improve their lives so that they might decide that continuing to live is better than not. Knowing the US, though, assisted suicide would cost a fortune (probably up front lol) and I bet it wouldn\u2019t be covered by any insurance programs for any reason, for fear of their customer base starting to shrink. Hopefully either the trends of US healthcare change, or one is lucky enough to be considering suicide in someplace with better healthcare than the US.",

I did well with the academic side of college and had been considered a formidable candidate for professional school (wanted to be PA or SA).  With fifteen years of therapy under my belt, I'm a janitor and in my more lucid moments I'm somewhat grateful that I'm mostly self-supporting.  I'm not really improving, just treading water, and I can't save for the future or afford a pet.\n\nThe thought of living like this for another 20 or 30 years scares the bejesus out me.  The many, varied and often disturbingly creative ways I've hurt myself troubles my therapist (my first one told me, not long before her retirement, that I made her fear for license).  Euthanasia seems like a preferable option to suicide (especially if the method is very painful and bizarre) or being impoverished, elderly and alone.\n\nI support the idea of euthanasia as an elective procedure.  However I understand that to be ethical it probably would need to be approved by a doctor or panel.  Unfortunately I think most psychiatrists would view it as admitting failure on their part and giving up on mine.\n\nIt would be nice if euthanasia was seen as taking the least painful of many bad options, but if the world was that nice a person wouldn't be in a situation where they needed to make that decision in the first place.",

Sick people are a big money and time drain on their families and there have been examples where someone has wanted to die so that their family is able to save money. \nSo the idea of free choice is great but the idea that someone wants to kill themselves because they are worried about being a financial drain on their families? That makes me want to ban euthanasia and push for free healthcare. \n\nFurther, if we as a society truly accept that mental illness is as serious as physical ones, then why aren\u2019t people who are just plain suicidal allowed to determine their own death? It seems like suffering is suffering. If someone doesn\u2019t want to live, should they be forced to ever? Should our obligation to affirm life be weighed heavier than their personal choice to die, without hurting anyone else? And at what age should we make that choice available? \nAn age limit seems absurd when the terminal part means \u201cdeath is coming soon\u201d. So a 13 year old can suffer with a terminal illness that doctors have said will kill them but an 18 year old doesn\u2019t have to? If we are actually considering this a right, then we should consider all the facets and extend it to as many people as possible.",

Free Healthcare (well, government provided healthcare) is just better for people actually being treated, and then for the topic at hand, offering euthanasia with in it, as an entirely voluntary option seems like it'd solve your problem here.\n2. The argument is for terminal illness, with suicidal tendencies are not considered to be.\n3. The age limit is where we consider someone able to make their own decisions, with their carers deciding before (which I have problems with, due to them being able to deny so much to their children, if they want to), but I agree with your point of that being a large, unsolved problem I can't really answer when personal consent is essential.",

If a relative of a person with a terminal illness obtained strong sedatives, knowing the person intended to use them to kill themselves, the relative may be considered to be assisting suicide.",

There was some controversy about whether it was constitutional, since it was arguably an intrusion on federal jurisdiction (criminal law is federal), but I think the feds decided not to challenge it (politically awkward).\n\nIt was all made moot by a Supreme Court of Canada decision that not allowing a path to a dignified death in these circumstances was unconstitutional (oversimplifying, but kinda saying the right to die was inextricable from the right to live, IIRC). SCOC gave the federal government a certain amount of time to come up with a bill, which it eventually did.\n\n*BUT... that bill was more restrictive than the SCOC decision, so it was challenged, and an appeals court (in Quebec) struck down the requirement in the law for death to be reasonably foreseeable, allowing people that are suffering greatly but not necessarily terminal in the short term to request MAID. The court made the decision immediate for the individuals that brought the case, but paused wider application, giving the government time to amend the law (they just got an extension, 'cause covid...)",

Once you reach the stages where you want to be put down he will come over and see if you qualify to be put down and if he thinks so you still need to get a second opinion from a different doctor.

After a consult with phych and documeting that his current state was his new baseline (wasn't expected to further recover), they (hospital) agreed to allow him to pass, they stopped all treatment and support, and moved him to hospice care. He passed a week later after refusing all food and fluid, and being given pain meds only for comfort.\n\nAlthough it wasnt \"immediate\", it was legal with his consent.

Convince her she's a burden!\n\nLots of people will be like \"naw, this wouldn't happen!\", but it already does in lots and lots of little and more innocuous ways. A perfect example is America's fascination with perfect teeth. How many kids get braces before they even hit puberty? Do they really need to? Naw. Look at the rest of the world. We do it \"just because\". Well, that's hardly a reason to kill a person. How long until we get to the Logan's Run's \"Carrousel\"?\n\nEdit: I see there's a whole lot of people who don't understand the slippery slope argument. It starts with something serious and moves on to something inconsequential. Things demonstrate that exact slope happening, like braces. See, when braces started, few people got them and only if their dental health was at risk and now you get them because that's what you do when you're 10. Just like idea of euthanasia/assisted-suicide, it starts because there's a real thing that should be taken care of, but then moves on to that's just what you do when you're 30 (the Logan's Run reference). Many people just don't want to start down that slope. \n\nI'm not going to address all of you that simply don't get what \"slippery slope\" means individually. You're either capable of investigating the thing or just having your wrong gut reaction. \n\nLastly, just because there are people who use the \"slippery slope\" argument doesn't mean that I am one of them so if you personally attacked me for attempting to explain it so your small closed minds can understand it, shut the hell up and go away you morons.",

Part of my job is to teach family members that death is ok, NOT treating medical conditions to prolong life is ok. We live in an age of such advanced medical technology, pills and surgery that so many people seem to expect to prolong life forever, even when the person is in the most horrific condition (e.g. advanced dementia, end stage multiple sclerosis). \n\nBut even doctors aren't taught about hospice. Hospitals do a poor job of starting hospice. So I get patients that only live a week or sometimes 24 hours, because the family and doctors do everything they can up to the last hour. It's terrible for the patient and the family. It doesn't give them the quality time they could have had under hospice, or to prepare for death in a meaningful way.",

Whether so single payer or lots of private insurance, the insurance company is always going to push for the cheaper option. They already do this, in diagnostics and treatment. Often the cheaper option will be one death as opposed to many treatments, especially when so often any given treatment isn't a guarantee and there's \"trial and error.\" I certainly don't want insurance to pressure anyone into dying. I'm suspicious it could eventually be presented by insurance as someone's only available option, but even if it isn't, just the financial pressure with the easy opportunity is too much. People already kill themselves because they feel like a burden, imagine how many more will be pushed to that when the biggest barriers of doing so (getting a means prepared, following through the act oneself, and dealing with the pain) are removed. And usually that happens because of depression or other mental illness, which are historically undertreated! Insurance could be even less likely to treat mental illness when they know they could be financially rewarded for it when the sick person agrees to just die.",

            "comment": "In the Netherlands it\u2019s legal BUT there are some rules to it. Children under 18 are only allowed when there is unbearable suffering and no hope for improvement. We had to go through the process with my sister when she had been deadly ill for 7 months at the age of 10-11 ( and the doctors would not listen to us, she had a tube from the stomach through which she was fed but her body had rejected it and all kinds of nasty tissues and inflammations had developed, when we had permission and the documents for euthanasia however they did listen and removed the tube expecting it not to be true but instead of a 1 hour \u2018inspection\u2019 surgery to see her stomach they did a 5 - 6 hour one to remove the tube and tissue ). \nAnd we were starting it last year when she had fallen terribly ill but were sadly too late. ( she suffocated before we were able to start the treatment and procedures ) \n\nEither the person has to be suffering terribly and be terribly ill and not get any better. ( prospect of dying a horrible and/or painfull death )\nOr they have to be an adult and make clear why they no longer want to live. ( terrible future health wise , bad health, very old with a bad health, cancer etc. ) \nYou have to be able to talk to the doctors and tell them you wish to die. There is a whole procedure and you have to be found to be right of mind and in your right to ask it. ( when you suffer dementia or other conditions that may cause you to not be able to speak or not be right of mind you probably will not be able to have euthanasia) \n\nThe debate about euthanasia is still ongoing though, just like the one about abortion. I think it\u2019s terrible we\u2019re more compassionate towards our animals than our own. The debate here, and the reason why it\u2019s still difficult to go through is because of religious reasons...\nThere is a huge group of christians, catholics and the likes who are against euthanasia because they believe their faith sees it as su\u00efcide or murder and you need to trust their sky spirit to determine when you die. Wether that be in a horrible way or not, you need to die from \u2018natural\u2019 causes the way their faith intends you to. The only other debate point is age, are old people who\u2019ve had a fulfilling life and don\u2019t want to die from bad health allowed to do so? Even when they\u2019re healthy now? What about people we can\u2019t help and \u2018fix\u2019 and who in the end will do it themselves anyway? \nBut the biggest part is still the religions their belief it isn\u2019t allowed. I know of two people who made the choice. Both young ( 34 and 50+ ) and both with an outlook of a horrible death. The youngest was \u2018helped\u2019 at the hospital and would\u2019ve suffocated. The older one had cancer for a second time, no prospects of it going away and a terrible health. They\u2019ve would\u2019ve deteriorated untill there was nothing left with a hell of a lot of pain. Their GP helped and arranged everything with them. \n\nIf we could\u2019ve had the choice my sister would\u2019ve had euthanasia too. It was what we preffered instead of suffocating with my father there helpless next to her. But sadly her body couldn\u2019t put up with it any longer. She died 15 minutes before they would have the conversation with her doctors and start treament. \n\nOn the other hand there is something you do need to realise. In many cases, like ours, if the patient can\u2019t speak any longer and the family needs to step in to decide. It\u2019s a lot harder to decide. I\u2019ve had to put down three guinea pigs and our family dog. All at a point there was no hope and their health was in such a bad shape it was the kindest thing to do. But those decisions are already hard as hell. The feeling afterwards: \u2018did they want it?\u2019 and \u2018was it right to do?\u2019 Are allready there with them. Let alone you need to decide over or with a family member, a human being. Yes, you don\u2019t want them to suffer and you don\u2019t want them to die a horrible death. But you still live with a feeling of: but is there no hope? No hope at all? And you need the right doctors and specialist around you to make that decision. You cannot turn it back. And you will need to live with it. But in my personal opinion it is the last kindness we can show someone. Wether they suffer physically or mentally and will never be able to live a good life and have a fulfilling life with quality of life, they should be able to decide to leave however they want. \n\nWe\u2019ve always had the state of mind that we would make the decision when time came. And her quality of life would be the measure by which we would decide. In the end we were too late, after 4 days of fighting for her life, no progress and her body getting tired. Seeing her deteriorate with no hope of a ( descent ) recovery. We knew what had to be done. And I would like my other family members to have the choice when time comes. I have a younger brother who is also disabled. We\u2019ve got a DNR for him as well and the same principle. When his quality of life might make life unbearable we would decide the same. It\u2019s a hard subject to talk about. But very important. Ans i think it should be a basic human right. We have no choice over where, when and how we are born. At least let us decide when enough is enough.",

We identify more strongly with each other, and don't want to see ourselves in that position or making that decision.\n* The Slippery Slope.  Once it's legal to kill a helpless person, it's possible to generate circumstances in which you can claim that someone was helpless, dying, and consenting even if they weren't.  Sure, it may not be easy or likely, but as long as you have to fight to the bitter end for every human life, this sort of murder cover-up isn't really possible.  A mysterious death of someone on life support is still suspicious if there aren't medical reasons for it.  Not to mention that, given a few decades and evolving economic conditions, and next thing you know you're euthanizing the disabled *without* their consent...\n* Humans are more valuable resources than animals.  Sad to say but true.  Civilization runs on human productivity.  Even an elderly, terminally ill invalid is a resource... to the hospital billing someone for their care if nothing else, economically speaking.\n* Consent is a tricky issue at the best of times.  In matters of life and death, whether someone is of sound mind to consent to such an action is very difficult to nail down, legally speaking.  The likelihood of significant legal ramifications becomes too high.  Someone's going to disagree and file suit, and your defense - that they consented - is difficult to mount.\n\nBesides, there are countries in the world that have overcome these issues and made consensual euthenasia legal.  I think they're in the minority, but still.",

A psychiatrist, the personal GP, nurses, doctors that can shed light on the medical condition of the patient. A legal euthanasia is not a one man job and the process takes a lot of time. \n- sick people are not cash cows in most societies. The profit of an insurance company is a weird reason to keep someone alive when they are in pain imo\n- consent is a tricky one, espacially with things like dementia.

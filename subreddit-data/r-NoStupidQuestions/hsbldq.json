My psychiatrist specializes in ADHD and believes there's two types of ADHD: 1) ADHD with sensory oversimplification 2) ADHD without.\n\nI recently started taking guanfacine to treat sensory issues and it's been amazing. It's like I'm not as aware of things around me but in a good way. It's not the anxiety-driven hyperawareness I had before. I can also tolerate higher amounts of stimulants without getting anxiety which makes it balance really well. No more overthinking how someone is gonna take my email in a negative way, etc.",

Not that I knew that because there were so few times that my sinuses weren't partially stuffy.  A few years ago I went to an ENT for an unrelated issue and he pointed out the sinusitis, did a CT scan of my head and showed me how utterly blocked everything was.  He recommended balloon sinuplasty, and if you guessed that means they inflate a balloon up your nose and inflate it, you'd be right.  It expands the sinus passages so they can drain properly.  He also zapped my turbinates to shrink them.\n\nIt wasn't as awful as it sounds, in my case at least it was totally painless with the local anesthetic.  I didn't expect my sense of smell to improve, but the difference was amazing and immediate after the anesthetic wore off.  To put it in terms of vision, a room lit by a candle was suddenly lit by fluorescents.  I never knew there was *detail* when it came to smell.  Naturally this affected my sense of taste, and a glass of orange juice blew my mind.\n\nFrom your description below I guess your anosmia is neurological instead of mechanical, but have you spoken to an ENT about it?  There may be options out there you never imagined, as was my case.",

It's been 16 years and there hasn't been a single day that I haven't wished for it back. \n\nI want to smell my husband and my kids. I want to smell the rain and cut grass, the ocean and food cooking. I want to smell the gas leaking out of my stove and rotten milk before I drink it. Not having a sense of smell is extremely sad and lonely. I'm sorry for the over sharing, it's just difficult to describe how hard it is to not have it.",

I still play, but not nearly as much as I used to. \n\nI have been watching Hulu and Netflix a lot. Binging on old favorites and finding new things. I had no idea I'd enjoy some of the anime stuff out there, but some are fun to watch.\n\nWhat about photography? Even if all you have is your phone, you can take some pretty nifty low tech pics of flowers, bugs, clouds, plants, cats, dogs, etc. I have a goal of catching a lightning bolt going across the sky, maybe your friends could set a similar goal?\n\nCooking can be awesome and cathartic. Plus you get some good eats if you do it right.\n\nFor painting, I'd highly recommend watching WowArt  on YouTube, that guy is amazing.\n\nTry new hobbies, even if you don't think you'd be good at it. You don't have to be good at it. Hobbies are about the journey of improving whatever skills you set out to learn.",

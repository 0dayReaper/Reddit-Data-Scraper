I uh didn\u2019t think a 5 min google search was going to blow up like this. I also would like to clarify that I meant I didn\u2019t understand why people were acting like it was new news which people have discussed below.",

Wayne Madsen is an author and conspiracy theorist, not a journalist. \n\nThis blog post links to waynemadsenreport.com (the home page) as its source. Feel free to check it out for yourself, it\u2019s a trashy conspiracy site that looks like it time traveled from 2003. \n\nThe settlement allegations in the blog post from legalschnauzer are nowhere to be found. \n\nDonald Trump has done countless things worthy of anger and criticism. Please fact check everyone, knowledge is power",

If you're trying to reach people in rural America where internet speeds can be ridiculously slow, you want your site to load quicker than more reputable sites, like mainstream news sites. The best way of achieving that is to make it as simple as possible, and the sort of thing that could be loaded with no issues back in the days when everyone had shitty internet.\n\nEdit: changed to make this sound less authoritative. I never said this was a fact, it was just a theory I've heard before",

No database.  No CMS.  Just what needs to be there in as few bytes as possible.  This is a nightmare to maintain, though, so most people are going to use CMSs where possible; and only use it where bandwidth is going to be a problem; like very rural areas or ship-to-shore comms etc.\n\nFast loading is a different art these days and the assumption is generally that the visitors are going to have at least passable internet.  So it's all about minimising database calls; and making pre-prepared cache pages; optimising the server software etc.",

There would be russian or east european girls at his parties, just hanging out.  He would promise them modeling careers or massage training and pimp them out.  At a high school in Palm Beach Florida, it became common knowledge that there was this creepy old guy called Jeffery that would pay 2 or 3 hundred dollars for a massage that would allways turn sexual.  Girls could make a couple hundred dollars and sometimes he just masturbated.  The ones he liked that cooperated became regulars, and the madams took compromising photos and threatened the girls if they talked.  \n\nSource: Robert Evans\nhttps://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/part-one-jeffrey-epstein-pimp-to-30710425/",

Noone can truly believe Epstain managed to kill himself, under suicide watch, in prison, with both cameras malfunctioning, and both guards sleeping... yet the media stops in it's tracks, satisfied to believe he really did.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone did come out to defend him from the royal family, but they did touch on the interview that Prince Andrew gave...remember the one where he couldn't remember where they took that picture with him and his victim, but he might have been eating pizza somewhere specifically at that time, and also it is impossible that it was him, the victim said that he was sweating all over her while they danced, and he doesn't sweat because he has a medical condition, fancy that.\n\nI hope one day we all know the truth.",

Republicans heavily downvoted comments that attacked Trump.\n\nThe republican downvoters were outnumbered by the democrat downvoters.   Sick of constantly being downvoted below 0, the Trump supporters/republicans left r/politics.   \n\nDespite being progressive myself, I regard the one sided echo chamber that was left in r/politics as dangerous and toxic.   \n\nFor one thing, no one left in r/politics saw the Trump win coming, despite the Trump win showing up in the polls if you actually took into account the stated margin of error.  \n\nFor another thing, the echo chamber has left hundreds of thousands of people unable to de-escalate political arguments  long enough to have a civil conversation long enough to *understand* why people are on the other side.\n\nWithout understanding, nothing can move in a better direction.",

Also as much as I dislike Trump, these are nothing more than an attention grab by \u201canonymous.\u201d The case shown in the documents was dismissed because there was a lack of evidence and in fact prosecutors stated that he was very helpful and likely not even a suspect.",

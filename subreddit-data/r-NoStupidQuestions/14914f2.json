A person can be despicable and still be right in many things.",

I think it\u2019s easy to overestimate the impact on one\u2019s personal life when news like that comes out, but remember you never knew this person, and this person never even knew of you.",

            "comment": "In a way this is what Harry Potter fans have to deal with. Many idolized JK Rowling the author, and many who did so were from the LGBT community. Now that she's labeled as transphobic, her once fans need to grapple with the fact that for a lot of them, the Harry Potter series shaped who they are today. \n\nI guess this is where I like the term \"emulation\" as opposed to \"imitation\". Emulation means to copy what is good, and drop what is bad. Whereas imitation is to copy both the good and bad. \n\nMy guess is that as much as the YouTuber is a creeper, the affectations that you picked up from them may not necessarily be bad. So long as you emulatint, not imitating. \n\nElon Musk is a great example of someone who has many positive traits worthy of emulation. But lots of terrible traits that should not be imitated.",

I take influence from them. I study them. I ask myself questions in the back of my mind about the editing, cinematography, acting, framing, music; things that some consider minutiae. It comes with being on the autism spectrum. You could say I don't experience the medium in the same way as Joe Average. I'm afraid that if I just passively, mindlessly enjoy stuff, I'll become just another consumer buying product, another statistic for the marketing guys. I don't consider myself a prude, though. I'm a huge fan of B-movies and exploitation flicks. I have every single Godzilla film. I enjoy movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme. I've enjoyed quite a few Michael Bay films and a couple of Adam Sandler comedies. Hell, if I had the time and editing software, I'd make a video essay reevaluating direct-to-video genre movies Molly Ringwald made the nineties. I love cinema, art and schlock. But sometimes, I have my limits. There has to be a moment where you just feel like standing up in the middle of the theater and telling everyone that life is short, that we're being conned out of our time on this earth to experience nothing more than a trivial distraction, and that we should all go out and do something more valuable. Spend time with loved ones. Help others. Learn something. Don't just occupy space. Don't go through the motions. Live for once, because someday, you'll be gone.",

I prefer things of substance as well but personally, I don\u2019t need everything to have a serious meaning or something. \n\nAnd what\u2019s saying people that go see those movies aren\u2019t doing those things? Hell my spouse and I love watching mindless movies. \n\nI don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with a mindless distraction. I\u2019ve had a hard life sometimes I need a break from my own thoughts. I\u2019m sure many others do as well.",

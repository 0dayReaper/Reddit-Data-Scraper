Some people have been raised to look at the evidence, others have been raised that A is true and B is a lie.  \n\nGetting defensive or angry only happens when people are struggling to justify their position.  If you have come to a given viewpoint through logic and reason, then you are able to justify your position.  \n\nOnly when your position is dictated by dogma, are you likely to struggle to justify it.",

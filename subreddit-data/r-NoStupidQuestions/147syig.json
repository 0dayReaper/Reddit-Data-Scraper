Like for example it is only been 5 years since /r/nationalsocialism was banned. \n\nReddit used to allow almost everything and gradually clamped down.",

Unless they have some way of finding me, the person, it doesn't matter even slightly to my private life.\n\nSocial Media services primarily earn their income through advertisement and ads that can be targeted are worth more money than genetic site-wide ads.  This creates an incentive structure where the social media sites want to know everything possible about you.  \n\nBack in my day, in the Internet days of yore, it used to be such that the worst thing that you could do to a person was to 'dox' them, i.e. say Difficult_Bit is Jane Smith and they live at 124 XY lane.  That opens a person up to all manners of danger from the online sphere.  Now every online service is trying to do this to every single user because it earns them $0.09/ad impression instead of $0.03.\n\nPrivacy is the ability to separate your actual person from your online activities.  Not being able to delete posts.\n\nHaving decentralized services based on a protocol means you can care as much or as little about your privacy as you'd like and there is nobody gatekeeping access to these services that can require you identify yourself or require you give them specific data prior to accessing the services.",

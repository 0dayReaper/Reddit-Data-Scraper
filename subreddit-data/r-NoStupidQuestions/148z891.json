If so, how would one know what it\u2019s supposed to feel like? Gender roles? If that\u2019s the case isn\u2019t this idea of rejecting labels for favor of new labels enforcing gender roles?",

It's not about gender roles, it's about an internal perception of gender identity, which people generally only notice when it is different from their assigned gender. You can reject gender roles while still having a gender identity. These new labels don't enforce gender roles, but help people describe and communicate their experiences when other labels don't fit them.",

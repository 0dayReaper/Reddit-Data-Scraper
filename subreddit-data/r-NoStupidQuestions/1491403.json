    "postText": "So I wear very baggy clothes (I\u2019m 5\u201d4 and 135 pounds) but they like stick to my body instead of flaring out and giving the baggy effect. What am I doing wrong? Am I not wearing baggy enough clothing? Or is it cuz I buy usually straight jeans but it happens with pajamas too, how do I stop them from sticking to my body",

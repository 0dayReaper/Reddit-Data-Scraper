    "postText": "Ok I don't want this to come across as racist, I am genuinely wondering if this standard behavior in other parts of the world, or I just keep encountering really rude people.\n\nWhen I am at a store and someone is looking at a section, I either wait until they are done, or I say excuse me and grab what I want and get out of the way.\n\nI live in an area with a lot of recent immigrants. At least 4 times in the past month I have been shopping, and just suddenly have hands reached in front of my face etc trying to get something off a shelf. Like out of nowhere. Today basically this woman almost pushed me out of the way to get what she wanted. no excuse me, nothing, just like boom i'm here now too.\n\nI don't want to start a fight and be like, get some manners, if that is not what they are used to etc etc. But it really is starting to piss me off",

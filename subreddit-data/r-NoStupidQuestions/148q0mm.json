    "postText": "The day before yesterday, I (19M, 260LBS, 5'9) started lifting. Nothing heavy, just 20lbs dumbells. I'm incredibly weak, so this is a pretty annoying challenge. Yesterday I walked half a mile, and lifted 60 times each arm. 25 in the morning. 35 at night (I couldn't sleep). In the long run though, will this even help? It's a lot of effort for someone as weak as I am, but I really do want to thin up on the torso and bulk up a bit on the arms. If I do this everyday for a month, I know I wouldn't see progress. But if I stuck to it for 2, or even 3, would I lose weight? Would I get any stronger at all with something as light as 20lbs? Well, not light to me, they're quite heavy, but still.",

            "comment": "To gain strength and muscle, you need to be progressively overloading, and bringing your muscles close to failure during an exercise.\n\nIf you are lifting these weights for 20 reps per set, but you\u2019re muscles are not getting fatigued, you will not make much progress.  If you are barely able to get 20 reps, and that last rep feels like your soul is leaving your body, that\u2019s a good indication that you are probably going to gain strength over time.\n\nThere are many ways to progressively overload.  The easiest way is the increase the weight.  After a while 20lbs for 10 reps may be easy, which is a sign that you should increase to 30lbs for 10 reps.  This will almost definitely be harder.  And after a few weeks when this is easier, you can progress to 40lbs.\n\nAnother way to overload is to increase the reps.  If 10 reps of 20lbs is easy, try 20 reps of 20lbs.  Then 30 reps.  As long as you are going to (or close) to failure on each set.\n\nThis is how people get strong and build muscle. Follow some reputable fitness influencers , some lifting sites, or find someone at a gym and get on a program. It\u2019ll help immensely.",

                            "comment": "A common term within lifting is Rep Ranges, which specifies a lower and upper bound of reps for a given set.\n\nFor example, a bench press program may say something like 3x8-12 of 225lbs.\n\nThis indicates that we should be doing 3 sets of 225lbs on bench press, and pushing ourselves to go for 12 reps each set. On week 1, I will probably get something like 10 reps on the first set, 9 reps on the second set, and 8 reps on the third set.  On week 3, I may be able to get 12/11/11.  Once you feel confident, you can increase the weight and start over.  This means you\u2019ll only be able to do less reps of 235lbs, but after a few weeks you\u2019ll get to 12 reps and the cycle repeats.\n\nThis is what we mean by progressive overload, and it works for every single muscle group you have on your body.",

Semi-frequently.\n\nAs for diet, I'm not on one and don't plan to. Since I was a younger kid, I haven't been able to eat most things. I don't know why, but my tastebuds reject most food, and my body just will not force it down. My family and I have guessed it's a medical issue due to a lot of my problems being similar to those with diagnosed ARFID. I've tried to brute force my way through it, but I end up a mess every time. That could maybe be explained by autism. I'm probably autistic too. Pretty much everyone in my family is diagnosed with autism except me. Grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, and both sisters. I was never diagnosed with any conditions or disorders at all (other than adhd due to it being exceptionally bad) because growing up, I never went to the doctor. Now I don't even have one.\n\nI eat things that aren't very healthy, like potatoes. The main thing I eat is potatoes, actually. Normally, I cut and fry them, but other times, I'll make homemade potato skins. Other times, I'll eat frozen food, like corn dogs or little pizzas. This diet is very unhealthy, but I only eat once or twice a day, so I always figured it evened out for the most part. I haven't been gaining weight in a long time. The last time I saw the scale move upwards, I was 16 or 17. Now, it stays around 260, within 2 or 3 pounds.\n\nMaybe baked potatoes would be better for health and for portions? Bacon bits to add a little protein, which is good for muscle, even if only a little.",

I want the body that looks a little muscular normally, but not more than average. The kind that looks normal until you flex, then everything is way more pronounced. Ik the \"sleeper build\" thing is a joke, but I do actually want that. The thin but muscular look. That's what I want to see in the mirror. I wear baggy clothes too, which would help that.",

            "comment": "Some thoughts:\n\nBodies are weird. You mentioned wanting to cut belly fat and add arm size. How you do those two things may be very different, and lots of people\u2019s bodies respond differently to different exercises, etc\u2026. \n\nI would focus, personally, on non-appearance based outcomes. Strength for example: Decide to get stronger. Start looking into some beginner workout routines. Arms, legs, core, etc. Lots can be done with body weight. You can see immediate progress and maybe unexpected benefits. (For me, some joint and back pain got a LOT better when I started doing regular, light strength training. \n\nI would also look at diet as part of this too. Portion control is huge. Drink a ton of water to help. What you eat matters, and so does how much. \n\nI would also research how to do exercises properly. Good technique will limit injury risk and lead to better results for your efforts.",

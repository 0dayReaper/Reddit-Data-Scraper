Hearing things like \" you can't let it win!, you are strong, fight back!, etc.\". I know they mean well. But hearing that stuff all the time for years while my disease is kicking my ass (literally and figuratively:P ), being in the hospital all the time, having 4 major surgeries, etc. Often I don't feel like fighting. It's exhausting and denying how my health has messed up my life makes it feel like I didn't fight hard enough. If only I fought harder I'd somehow be doing better. I know it isn't good to go to the opposite extreme and wallow in self pity. But it also isn't good to ignore how much being chronically ill has affected my life. Mostly for the worse. It's almost like I'm not allowed to feel bad, frustrated, or defeated. Because that's the illness winning. Anyway, sorry for the ranting and venting. Take care Everyone! :)",

I don\u2019t understand the details, but they went to put stents in for chemo then decided she was to weak and held off for a bit, and this caused the cancer to spread rapidly (I think they said oxygen exposure but don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right). At any rate it went to her brain and she was gone not long after. \n\nEveryone says we should have sued, honestly I think they did her a favor and I know she would think so as well. We all knew she didn\u2019t want to live that way and the doctor had already told us they can\u2019t save her, just buy her time.",

There was no getting better for him.\nAnd yes, he suffered. He very nearly drowned in his own phlegm on several occasions during that week. He suffered many indignities that he should have not gone through.\nBut, the doctors could show now mercy on him or the family.

It is not one often considered it seems.  People don't realize how badly senior citizens can be treated by families because people who treat them well cannot even fathom that happening.  In care situations and at home situations they are abused  sexually, physically and emotionally more than anyone would want to know.\n\nThat all being said I am fully for PAS with the proper stipulations.  I think that people whose religion doesn't allow them to do so can abstain and should have zero say over others that do not.

They simply stopped all treatment, stopped eating, and coordinated with friends and loved ones so that someone could find them soon when the time came. They even had a gathering (party is too festive of a word) where they had a last chance to see a lot of extended family and friends. It was both sweet in an odd way and heartbreaking that this is how they had to do it, instead of quickly and humanely.",

She needed to wear a button thing at all times in case something happened to her(and the thing wasn\u2019t even water proof so she couldn\u2019t take it in the shower(you can guess how that turned out, luckily she survived). \n\nAfter a while she was placed in an elderly home, with no friends at all. She had lived on while all her friends had seen the dirt. She made a few at the elderly home but they saw the dirt themselves too. So all she had was basically her family. My core family lived to far away to visit her often so it was really only her children who came to visit her at a regular basis. \n\nTime went on and she got worse. She had horrible nightmares because of her medication. Dreaming about the second world war and alike. Most of her days were spent sleeping and waking up to eat and other important stuff. We went to visit her once, but her memory had faded so much she didn\u2019t even know who we were, so it wasn\u2019t any reason for us to visit her unluckily. Eventually she died which I think was the best for her.",

His barn cat just had kittens, she brought them to his lap (barn cat is a loose term, he spoiled and doted on every animal on his property, they all loved him). We stayed outside with him, surrounded by his sheep, goats, his favorite llama and dogs with a lap full of tiny kittens until he passed peacefully.

Fortunately, he met the strict criteria and had his mental faculties to be able to make the decision.\n\nI had an uncle who died about 15 years ago from cancer. This was long before we had the right to die legislation. It was an absolute horrible, long and drawn out passing. He was an awesome guy, was a big burly teddy bear worked 20 years as a firefighter and was a very proud man.\n\nBy the time he passed away, he was about 90 pounds and spent his last 3 months bedridden unable to even use the washroom himself. I remember asking the doctor and my mom's conservative family the OP's exact question. Why did we put our dog to sleep when he got cancer because it wasn't fair to let him suffer but we couldn't do the same for my uncle.\n\nThey all thought I was a monster for even suggesting such a thing. I couldn't then and even today I can't grasp why they let it go on for so long. He was dying, there was no cure, there would be no miracle. I know that had he been able to, he would have wanted to chose to die before it got the point he did. It still bothers me all these years later. I feel like he deserved better",

Grief isn't logical, especially when paired with this kind of social conditioning.",

One of the reasons is because unethical family members may advocate for putting grandma/grandpa etc out of their misery to hasten getting their part of the inheritance.  Since putting animals out of their misery doesn't carry this benefit, this ethical dilemma isn't there.  With human euthanasia it would be important build checks and balances into a broad state or countrywide system to ensure that's not happening.",

Animals dont value living in pain for the sake of continued living. They just suffer and suffer and are miserable until they die. So once your animal is only suffering, you can put them to sleep and they dont wake up, but those final moments shouldnt be scary for the animal. They should feel comfortable and tired, and unaware of life vs death. Most people would be terrified in the same situation because we spend way too much time thinking about death.",

Designating a healthcare power of attorney that you trust and know will respect your wishes is so incredibly important.

I think a lot of times (but unfortunately not all) people make decisions to keep  their loved one on machines and keep doing procedures because they still have hope despite all odds and don't want to given up because of \"what if.\" It comes from a loving place, I honestly believe that, however if people have clearly stated they don't want that, it should be respected.",

I had considered the same question you posted for years, but when it happens to someone in your family, the roadblocks become more obvious.  We did not know how long she would live. Her decline was gradual, until it wasn't. There is a component of liver failure where the toxins your liver fails to absorb end up in your brain, and it can change your personality, inhibit your mental ability, and come and go at seemingly random times.  There was no way she could have made this decision for herself.  I can't even pick the time frame in the 18 months before her death that this cognitive decline started.  \n\nI fully support people being able to pick the time of their death, and have a painless-as-possible one, if they have the mental capacity to do so, and some level of terminal/chronic diagnosis.  For a lot of people, though, there is no clear line.  And I can't imagine my father, or myself, having to live with the memory of making that call.",

            "comment": "u/TheJeff is the closest on this one. It's deeply tied to history and belief systems. Greeks and Romans practiced euthanasia. It was debated by Christian theologians during the Middle Ages and by the Enlightenment philosophers we still look to today.\n\nFor this discussion, I assume, OP, you're willing to take animal euthanasia as a given, that you wouldn't advocate for its abolition. I think it's not helpful to compare animal euthanasia to human, as there's no significant historical debate over whether the former is ethical.\n\nThe debate around human euthanasia (and suicide) is interesting in that it shows what a given culture takes for granted as its key value. In Japanese history for instance there was a certain comfort with people committing suicide after \"dishonoring\" themselves, whether in battle or in finance. In Christian cultures, there's a pretty strong correlation between belief that God is \"in control\" and lack of tolerance for euthanasia. And in western medical culture, death is an enemy to be vanquished and virtually no part of a doctor's training is how to approach death in any other way, to the point that many doctors are never even taught how to discuss death with a dying patient's family.\n\nSo, OP, as you think about this, I would suggest you rephrase the question as less argumentative (your question implies you've already formed a firm opinion) and more as \"How did it come to be that people believe it is preferable keep a suffering person alive, even against their express wish to die?\"",

            "comment": "If you were looking for the answer for why this paradox exists when a human is suffering so much that he or she *wants* to die, then I think the answers that have already been given are sufficient. But I think your question might have been something else, or at least there's an equally good question to ask: Why do we *generally* consider it \"merciful\" to euthanize an animal in pain while we *generally* try to keep people alive despite the pain. Think about it not in terms of crippling end-of-life pain but, say, a broken femur that's never going to work right again, or a cancer that's in its early stages. A lot of animals would be put down in those situations, but no one would think about euthanizing a person with those symptoms just yet.\n\nI think the answer there is that humans, because of their developed brains, can have meaningful lives despite disability and pain. We don't have to walk to have friendships. We can enjoy novels, and films, and games even when we hurt and cannot move. We can create and interact and sometimes enjoy life despite pain.\n\nAnimals are much more physically-oriented. When they're in pain or disabled (to a degree) it overwhelms their existence and they don't have the intellect to find escape in other things.\n\nStill, one of the tragedies of being a pet owner is that you're never really 100% sure whether the animal has reached that point; whether the cat would rather power through the next three months just to have some more time with you on the couch, or whether she's ready to go.",

There is debate that this could be abused by abled caretakers against the disabled to end their lives against their actual wishes and not all disabled people can speak up for themselves to prevent being \"euthanized.\"  It's not a bad idea to have it be an option, but it needs to be acknowledged that there is a lot of gray to the debate and it needs to be addressed to make it a truly safe option of actual choice for all involved.",

In a nutshell- we are complete assholes when it comes to death!",

He argues that it\u2019s a not logical and everyone ends up better if you focus on quality end of life experience rather than keep alive at all costs.\n\nThat being said, the author also admits that despite his knowledge and his experience as a top doctor, he could not help but keep his dying father alive despite his father\u2019s wish to die.\n\nIt\u2019s just too emotional and painful of an experience and so you\u2019re not driven by logic anymore.",

You can choose to move a dying family member to palliative care (generally in the hospital), hospice (usually similar to a nursing home), or home hospice (at home with a little help from a nurse). Write a living will so your family knows you want this. I have friends in the ICU who would love to let more of their terminally ill patients die peacefully rather than keep them alive because of families\u2019 denial.",

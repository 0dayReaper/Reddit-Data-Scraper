    "postText": "I really hope this isn't a stupid thing to ask. \nBut recently I've started working in child care and I've noticed children smell really sweet. When I visit houses with children the air smells sweet and damp. And when I leave I can smell it on my clothes. \n\nI was wondering if its just vomit? Or some other bodily fluid in the house causing children to smell. But I've noticed it frequently. \n\nAlso as a side note, I have ASD and my sense of smell was always quite strong. I can smell myself when I'm sick, and I smell like glue. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it.",

You might be smelling a mix of the childcare products kids use as they are more likely to have that sweet, sugary smell to it. They also are the ones eating more sugary foods. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, it would be a bit neat if you were like Joy Milne. She is a woman who can smell Parkinson's disease. Probably not true and you would definitely be smelling something else, but it'd be neat for someone in the world to be able to smell something everyone else can't.",

Also, I don\u2019t have a particular strong sense of smell, yet I can smell it. \n\nBut, I don\u2019t know what it is, I am afraid. Not all kids eat lots of sweets, not all guardians use sweet smelling scents on babies and yet they all smell *like that*",

So babies and kids generally don\u2019t smell as bad as pre/teens. Not sure if it would cause the strong smell you\u2019re describing though",

Formula and breast milk on bibs l, clothing etc. It might be a sour smell af first, but it's not as unpleasant you might expect. And it's all babies. When I scrolled through the comments I was surprised no one else said this, because when I think of babies and smells, this is by far the strongest memory that came to my mind",

It's 100% the breast milk and the formula! FML, ty, I couldn't fucking figure it out... Also, don't worry, my foul mouth ass ain't worked with kids in almost 2 decades.",

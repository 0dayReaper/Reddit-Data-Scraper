And you come across a group of enemies and one surrenders, but you don't have any way to take him back to base or anything like that. \n\nAlso the scene in band of brothers when they came across the SS battalion and the officer guy saw that one young German soldier. If that soldier surrendered would he have to call of his attack to secure the prisoner. Or was he right to just kill him?",

So there is a way out that can be used.",

During WW2 a Waffen-SS armored spearhead under the command of \nJoachim Pieper killed 84 American POVs on its way to retake Antwerp. They were machine gunned and shot on the head with pistols.   \n\nIn the Pacific as the American army \nwas island hoping pushing the Japanese back to Japan, American soldiers killed many Japanese soldiers that surrendered. This was in retaliation of the brutality the Japanese exhibited throughout the entire conflict. Also these small Islands didn't have buildings to house prisoners, there was no materials to built prisons or food to share with the POVs. \n\nEven if that was possible as the American army moved forward, the Japanese patrols could've rescued the POVs that were left behind and used them to defend the mainland. So they were killed. The Australians were trained to kill any Japanese that surrendered with closed fists just in case they were holding explosives.\n\nA quote from Wikipedia:\nFurthermore, in many instances, Japanese soldiers who had surrendered were killed on the front line or while being taken to POW compounds. The nature of jungle warfare also contributed to prisoners not being taken, as many battles were fought at close ranges where participants \"often had no choice but to shoot first and ask questions later\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_prisoners_of_war_in_World_War_II\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmedy_massacre",

            "comment": "It's always a war crime to kill someone or de combat, which includes any soldiers who are surrendering.\n\nWith that being said, war is a messy business. All sides in a war, particularly large-scale conflicts will break the rules of war to one degree or another, even if they're making a best effort to follow them. Sometimes the choice will be made to kill surrendering soldiers due to circumstances even by militaries who really rather not take those kinds of actions.\n\nWhen judging participants in a war, it's usually better to look at how institutionalized breaking the rules of war is and what the circumstances of violations are. If a belligerent executes civilians regularly as a sort of standard practice, that is one extreme. Killing someone trying to surrender inside a building while you're still under fire is another extreme.  \n\nFor situations like the one you described, I think it's best to consider if it is a widespread practice or if is it individual soldiers/units making those decisions in difficult circumstances. War is a messy business and even if we hold ourselves to the highest standards, things are bound to happen when it's life or death. \n\nIt's still a war crime, but IMO there are definitely degrees of bad and mitigating circumstances in certain situations. No one has ever come out of a war with a perfect record.",

    "postText": "I was honestly curious for those that use non conforming pronouns, such as they/them, on how to address them. For example, if they are a service worker and the persons gender is obvious to assume (and this includes transitioning transgender people, I will always use my best judgement on this), I will usually say \u201cthank you ma\u2019am/sir\u201d in a way to show them my respect for their professionalism and service. However when I simply have no concrete assumption on this, such as those non conforming, I have no idea what to say. I guess I could just say thank you, but again I like to address someone further and I\u2019m unsure of how to do it properly. Would it be \u201cthank you them\u201d? \n\nI\u2019m in a rural, pretty right wing area where this kind of scenario isn\u2019t common, but I do visit areas of the latter. I just want to do right for my fellow humans and I have lack of experience when it comes to this. TYIA",

You don't need to use \"sir\" or \"ma'am,\" you can just say, \"Thank you.\"  And if someone hasn't told you their pronouns, use they/them to be safe.",

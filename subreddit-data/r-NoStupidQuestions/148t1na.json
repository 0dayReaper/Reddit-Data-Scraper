            "comment": "yes. white (and other groups that aren't indian and chinese) people are typically very curious about us because of how intensely different it is from their cultures/countries, so they visit. I'd say people probably are more drawn to china than india though, because of concerns for safety, especially women. i guess their pop culture is a bit more palatable for foreigners too considering how much of it is quite similar to what's consumed in the west, just in chinese language, while indian pop culture is a bit more unique to indians/south asians. this probably impacts the desire of tourists to visit. i know many non-chinese girls who have gone to china for cpop group concerts and such, but nobody really often goes to india for things like that.\n\ndespite the casual racism the average indian or chinese diaspora member may be faced with, i find that a lot of non-chinese and non-indian people have a lot of love and interest for our cultures.\n\nas an indian, i've always thought, with the rise of words like \"koreaboo\" and \"weeaboo\" and \"asiaboo\", that the og ___-boos were the \"spiritual\" \"yogi\" white people who would travel to india in like the 80s (?) onwards on a \"spiritual journey\" lmfao. so totally zen and downward dog bro, my chakras are so aligned rn \ud83d\ude29\n\nthey're always fun to interact with, assuming they aren't disrespectful.",

I just remember them by vaguely by what their character archetype is or what actions they took to influence the plot. \n\nThis is in contrast to my childhood where I remember full details about characters, even non-iconic ones and sometimes even minor parts.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? Is this because movies are less memorable in general? Or this just some lame side effect of adulting?",

We always watched TV with CC at her house and the habit stuck. I now watch things with CC whenever I am able. It also doesn't hurt that my own hearing isn't great, so with CC I don't have to strain to understand dialogue during loud scenes.\n\nRecently I started watching some Netflix anime with the better half. He likes dubbed (he's a heathen), so the characters are all speaking English. BUT the CC is a direct translation of the Japanese script! So 80% of the time what a character is saying &amp; what the CC is saying don't quite match up.\n\nFor example, a character might say \"Oh no, I overslept!\" while the CC says \"Oh no, I'm gonna be late!\" It's the same sentiment, just expressed slightly differently.\n\nI find it highly amusing to see some of the differences in language using this method. You might not like it so much, though!",

Film is a visual medium, you don't need to know the names of the characters in order for them to be great characters. I recently watched Marriage story and I thought it was phenomenal, but I certainly can't remember the characters' names. One of my personal favourite films ever is Lost in Translation, but again I wouldn't be able to tell you the characters' names, maybe that's because it has two A list actors, or maybe because they never introduce themselves to eachother in the film. Regardless, I still love the film and it doesn't detract from it at all.",

I'm face blind and the opening scene switching back and forth between DiCaprio and Damon was a mindfuck because I had to pause it and start over again to realize they were two different people.

That would mean for example actors that have been type cast, can give an entirely different movie experience to viewers that are familiar with them. \n\nIt doesn't have to be type casting either. Your mention of the word archetype rang a bell. I'm commenting on the hopes that my comment will jog another redditors memory.",

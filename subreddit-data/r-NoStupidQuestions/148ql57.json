    "postText": "I'm in my mid-20s (F) and I live at home with my parents. My parents refused to accept rent money from me, so we compromised and I currently pay for our car insurance, which includes my parent's cars, my two sibling's cars, and mine. The total amount of the car insurance payment is aroud $700. The two siblings mentioned don't live at home. Sometimes, I pay for groceries, family trips, family meals out, and other misc expenses (on my own accord).\n\nMy parents are not great with money. My mom likes to spend beyond her means, and my dad, albeit disapprovingly, lets her. The problem is that my mom likes to ask to borrow money from me. The amount varies, but typically ranges anywhere from $50 to $10,000. She has always paid me back but sometimes it takes months. Sometimes, she pays me back instantly in cash. On occasion, she has gotten annoyed with me when I ask her what the money is for or why she doesn't just go to the bank herself to deposit the money. I have asked her why she doesn't ask to borrow money from my older brother, but she has said that he and his fiance have a mortgage and other expenses to cover (even though his S/O is well off). \n\nFor additional context, I am Hispanic and the eldest daughter. I'm saving up to move out and relocate. I have a steady job and make an average income with enough to put money away in savings most months.\n\nI feel ungrateful for not wanting to lend them money, because they do so much for me. I am thankful that my parents give me a place to live and they help out a lot, but I would like them to stop asking for money so that I can save enough to move out. How can I ask them to stop asking me for money?",

You don't get to ask where the money is going when someone wants a loan. Either give them the money or don't; your only concern is whether or not they can pay it back with their current means. Don't be a usurer.\n3. If your mother is spending all of her money and her husband isn't giving her any more, neither should you.\n4. They have refused rent money, you owe them nothing. These loans are a power game.\n\nI understand the dynamics of a multigenerational family in America. It has benefits and drawbacks.\n\n**These people will bankrupt you.**\n\nAlso, don't save for college unless the thing you want to do absolutely requires a college education. ...in which case, if you were likely to get the position, you wouldn't have to scrape money together. Save for emergencies and self-sufficiency, instead.",

Those are video.\n\nBut for example the Trump stuff that's happening right now is all sketches. It sketches drawn by people.\n\nSo why do some of the people get the sketches and the other ones get the photos?\n\nIs there a rule or something? If you kill people you don't get the sketches you get the photos?",

If they don't allow cameras, then courtroom sketches are all you're gonna get. \n\nAs far as I know there's not much consistency as to *which* courts allow cameras. In many cases it's just up to the individual judge's discretion/preference.",

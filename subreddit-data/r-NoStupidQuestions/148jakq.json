    "postText": "I work in catering and have worked a LOT of weddings. One thing I\u2019ve noticed: almost every wedding playlist is the same, regardless of DJ. Does everyone just like the same music or is it more expensive to have a custom playlist? \n\nSome of songs I hear at every wedding, for reference (excluding line dances):\n- Cotton Eyed Joe\n- Soulja Boy\n- Take me Home, Country Roads\n- Mr. Brightside (once I heard this played 4 times over the course of a single wedding)\n- I Wanna Dance with Somebody\n\nI\u2019m not trying to judge couples for their wedding music choices, but I\u2019m curious as to why they\u2019re all the same. The most turnt I\u2019ve seen a wedding party get was when they played the Chicken Dance (full version) and it had me wondering why people don\u2019t play songs like it more often.",

            "comment": "That sounds like a pretty eclectic playlist to me (rap, country, rock, pop). Glad that the chicken dance is still bringing aunties out on to the dance floor.\n\nI think that the real answer is that it's pretty safe to stick to typical wedding songs. It's horrible to go to a wedding where no one is dancing. By having a few songs you know will get the old people up, and the young people, you're guaranteed to get people moving. Maybe that music isn't your cup of tea, but for many groups it is",

But mostly it's an excuse to jump around ( I'd play that song also). \n\nMr Brightside, I couldn't tell you why. I don't remember this from the last wedding I attended. \n\nTake Me Home Country Road might be a regional thing. (Just like I think we keep playing Don't Stop Believing because of the line \"born and raised in south Detroit\")\n\nI Wanna Dance with Somebody: Because yacht rock is awesome.",

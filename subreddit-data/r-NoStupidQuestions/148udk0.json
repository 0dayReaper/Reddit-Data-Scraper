    "postText": "How does youtube get away some of their false medical ads? I just watched one that said that tinnitus (ringing in the ear) will cause COMPLETE memory loss within 2-3 years. That the ringing is the sound of the brain cells and memories being erased. And if you want to stop the process then do the simple solution that has recently been discovered before it is too late.\n\n I hit skip after that because I couldnt stomach the insanity any longer. How does YouTube get away with allowing these ads? Do they not have to meet the same FTC regulations as ads on networks?",

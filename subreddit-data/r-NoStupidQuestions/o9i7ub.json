So now we're supposed to believe M4A is magically going to make everything better? I myself don't use the VA because it's such a mess, so it's not hard to see why so many Americans are skeptical of the government \"taking over\" healthcare no matter how bad the current system is. (For the record, I'm pro-M4A with the option to buy private if you want to, because even shitty insurance is better than nothing.)",

My BC used to be like $50 for 3 months. It then jumped to $150 if I used CVS, but $60 at Walmart or Walgreens. My current insurance uses CVS as their plan or whatever, but I just take that to Walgreens and it works. I honestly think CVS makes people think that they HAVE to use CVS if their prescription/health insurance is CVS sponsored.",

Sure the work is boring AF, but when you're able to cover your bills (my insurance plan is $45/month for a $3k deductible and out of pocket max - super cheap if I need no care, and any catastrophic events can \"only\" cost me up to 3k) you'd be surprised what kind of boring you can manage.\n\nI know that this might just sound like a capitalist hellscape, and it kinda is, but I swear that when you feel like your job actually pays what you're worth it's a lot easier to deal with the future...",

They were assuming that generally more people will pay in that they will ever pay out.\n* System worked so more and more companies tried to make money out of it.\n* Since it's capitalism, biggest ones decided simple scheme. To not allow smaller ones in - they will use their volume as a leverage. They demanded from hospitals lower prices because of how much business they were bringing in. Or they will send people to other hospitals. It worked. Hospitals gave them discounts.\n* But since hospitals did not want to pay up for discounts solution was made. Since it's insurance company that pay the price - why not inflate the price? This way they get the discount but hospital gets what it wanted. So they did that.\n* Now this is where fucked up part comes in. They could not inflate price just for insurance companies. That would be too obvious. So you, average Joe without insurance - you pay inflated price. This is where all those scary stories comes from about Ambulance ride that cost 3000$\n* Now you would think that insurance companies would be upset about inflated prices... but opposite happens. They were very happy about it. Because of inflated prices - normal people could no longer afford health care and they were FORCED to use insurance companies. And they still had their discount so they did not cared about any of it.\n* And because you are now forced to use them and health care is crazy expensive - they can inflate the price of insurance. \n\nI'm not sure how government can f\\*\\*k it up more than corporations did. It's one big scheme designed to squeeze you from every penny. For no reason other than bigger profit. \n\nAnd it's a perfect business because - NO ONE WANTS TO DIE.",

This model simply wouldn't work for a profit driven system.\n\nEdit: at least 4 people have replied that the ACA limits admin budgets to 20%. I may have been looking at old numbers, although I don't really know how the percentages are calculated.

There\u2019s a major city out west that has a hospital \u201ccomplex\u201d serves *a lot* of Veterans and is, to all accounts I\u2019ve heard, absolute steaming garbage. Whatever local issues it has are compounded by - again, what I\u2019ve heard - is tremendous mismanagement and or cronyism.\n\nMeanwhile, Veterans at certain hospitals in the Northeast have reported its paradise.\n\nLikewise, disability benefits is wholly unrelated to the provisioning of medical care, but \u201cthe VA\u201d is the villain all around. It\u2019s a large and complex topic (I might be more familiar than the average person with Jon Stewart\u2019s famous picture of a floor sagging from the weight of boxes), but you will rightly have someone complaining that their disability claim was mishandled when it\u2019s clear they lost both legs to an IED and it comes back not service connected, you will have someone wrongly complaining that the VA is jacking up their claim when their DOD doctor covered up the service connection in the original file (nah, just a scratch, don\u2019t know what he\u2019s complaining about, sent him home and said if it bothered him in the morning take 200mg ibuprofen, the baby),  or the Veteran sends themselves to a private doctor who doesn\u2019t see them for 6 months (which sucks, separately) and is then mad at the VA for the 6 month wait *it had no control over and had to wait for at their behest*. And then there\u2019s all sorts of schnadigans with older paper records.\n\nLike, all are true. Good people get treated well. Good people get screwed. And bad people screw up good parts of the system. And none of them are directly attached to the equally varied medical system.",

There was less bureaucracy in getting things approved and paid for. There was more wiggle room on what a doctor could prescribe without needing additional qualifying paperwork/authorizations. Choosing a provider was generally pretty open unless you had a strict HMO. You can find plans like this still, but you will pay a gross amount more for the privilege. Very few people can afford the \"nice\" insurance if their employer isn't heavily subsidizing that premium, and even then, fewer and fewer companies are opting for the higher tiers due to premium costs.\n\nMost of those knock-on benefits have been lost in the lower tiers as insurance companies constantly tighten their coverages to try and make more money off their clients. You're left with services that cover less or similar as something like Medicare. All while also costing absurdly more.",

Hear me out.\n\nThe whole idea of insurance depends on having more healthy people than unhealthy people. The higher the ratio of healthy to unhealthy people, the less expensive everybody's costs are.\n\nPrivate insurance companies are for-profit businesses. If there is a government-run insurance that can't reject applicants, then the private insurance companies will organize themselves to be a tiny bit more attractive than the government-run insurance, but only for healthy people. As a result, the government-run insurance's ratio of healthy people to unhealthy people will get worse and worse over time. As the service itself gets worse and worse as a result of that drain, the private companies will also get worse and worse because they only need to stay a little bit more attractive than the government option. *Everybody* ends up increasingly worse off except for the insurance executives and stock owners.\n\nIf you try to regulate the private insurance companies to force them to accept more people, they'll fight you tooth and nail. The only way to prevent the scenario I just described would be to force every insurance company to accept every applicant without prejudice, which is completely antithetical to insurance-as-business. They'll seek \"compromises\" because as long as they're allowed to set things up to give themselves some ability to be more attractive to healthy people and less attractive to unhealthy people, they'll be able to sabotage the government system in the long run. Sooner or later, the government system collapses enough for the private insurance companies to end up with enough power to be as greedy as they like.\n\nIf you have a single-payer system though, then\u2026 well, then everybody is in the same pool. That's the whole point, really. Everybody is incentivized to provide the best possible care because everybody has the same policy. It's in nobody's interest to sabotage anyone else. On top of that, the sheer _size_ of the single pool will lower costs too (thanks to economies of scale). It's better for everybody _except_ the insurance executives and shareholders who stand to gain more with the other system.\n\nHopefully what I said makes sense. In any event, I hope you have a great day.",

But a lot of people have an issue with the government taking more of your money to \"do ___\".\n\nFor one a lot of people don't trust that the government is actually going to do what they say they're going to do. Anytime a bill comes up that proposes increased taxes there's always debates that allege that the money is actually not going to go towards what it says it's going to.\n\nIe - there was a recent bill in my state that was designed to raise taxes with the extra money going to the schools but the argument against it was that the increased taxes would just go to the already overpaid School administrators and not actually go to the classrooms.\n\n2. Also America is the society that has individualism ingrained in it, but again Americans are generous so that doesn't tell the whole story.\n\n3. Especially when it comes to government programs, a lot of people may feel that those types of programs are going to wind up being exploited by people who don't truly need it and are just going to mooch off of the system. And they don't want their money going towards that. They would rather to donate their money somewhere where they perceive that it's actually going to be useful.\n\nThat or they feel that the people who are going to benefit shouldn't be benefiting from it. For example people who feel that illegal immigrants should not be entitled to free healthcare.\n\n-------\n\nOverall, I don't find that the majority of people or a large majority of people don't want programs like State health Care in place, or money allocated to the schools etc. With more people it boils down to concerns about who's making the decision about how that money is distributed and how that money is actually going to be distributed and if they feel like that is antithetical to their political or worldview",

The main difference though is this: \n\nif you find out a charity is corrupt and skimming off the top, you can stop giving your money to that charity immediately.\n\nIf you find out governmental agencies are corrupt and skimming off the top, and you decide to stop giving them money, you get thrown in prison. You could advocate for it, sure. But the whole time youre advocating, the system is getting more and more corrupt, taking more and more of your money in the process. And it takes a lot more effort to shut down a governmental agency via advocation vs simply not giving your money to a nonprofit that you know is corrupt.\n\nYou could talk about charity corruption, but at the end of the day people tend to *talk* less about it, and simply give their money somewhere else. With the government, the only thing you can legally do about it is talk, which is why so many people do.",

Americans don't trust the government to use taxes efficiently. Some Americans think that if things aren't going well for some people, they need to work smarter/harder, not depend on government which will squander the money. \n\nThere is some truth to the fact that working harder/smarter makes you more successful, but obviously that's not always enough in a society where you have low regulation on pay and uncontrolled variables like absurd healthcare costs and other landmines outside of your control.",

I also have private health cover and so probably contribute more than just taxes to the NHS if I use an NHS hospital through private. I would be happy to pay a little more tax. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I use what I take home after taxes, but I could adjust a little if I needed to pay a little more. \n\nMy success is blind luck; I\u2019m a white middle class male, born to a middle class family. I\u2019m smart (not as smart as I used to think \ud83d\ude1c). I have had a lot of good luck and not very much bad luck. I work hard, but so do many people who have a lot less. \n\nI don\u2019t see my taxes as me paying for services I get back: although I should at least pay for those if I can. I see taxes as a way of distributing the good fortune in an equitable way. You can\u2019t create a system that caters for good fortune, but you can create a system that more fairly distributes the gains of such good fortune and I am up for that; even if I can\u2019t buy the next gadget or quality item I want.\n\nEdit: I forgot to say that there will always be people that will take more than they give and never try to make up for it, but their existence can never be an excuse to not share with the much larger group of people who work hard and just have less luck; even if the luck is just that you were born and raised to have the mindset required to succeed",

They don\u2019t want someone else to get out of the grind easier than them and the people who have worked their whole lives don\u2019t understand how people could really be unable to find a job because that has never happened to them, so instead they assume the person is lazy and dishonest and therefore not worthy of help. The perception is probably related to what another commenter said about our society being based on the idea that anyone can do anything jf they work hard enough (even though that is demonstrably not how things actually work).\n\nAlso, news will cover abuses of systems, but generally not them working as intended. Maybe we need more heartwarming stories about people that just needed a safety net and then went back to work. Or people who are profoundly disabled and not supported by family and we know they need society to care about them.",

No doctors office. No school . No fire station . No police station . One sherrif office and a grocery store . And, terrible internet. So many businesses have closed , the hospital closed and sold off for apartments refab . The loss of the hospital ultimately means the slow death of the community, it is now fate \n\nThe people who are mad at this loss are the same people who voted for the leaders who voted for the loss. The community I grew up with and the people in it \n\nNow when I visit as an older adult , I hear the same talk from them with new eyes and ears. \n\nAngry at the loss of government investment and their local community, angry that city people have this and that and they don\u2019t, thinking everything is pointless because no matter how hard they try it will be completely lost and won\u2019t move the needle for them\n\nThese people are desperate for reasons to find why their community and it\u2019s future is crumbling and they all have been led to believe it\u2019s other small people taking away too much of the rations , they are blind to the billionaires game of stuffing pockets and playing politics\n\nIt is heartbreaking because it could be over come if everyone could understand each other and how very much the same we all are",

As someone else said in the comments, it's more centered on a distrust and desire to be separated from government.

And to achieve this you just work hard.  That's it.  \"If you work hard all your dreams will come true\" is the most American opinion you could have.\n\nWhen we get older this starts to be challenged by two things:\n\n1) Rich people.  We rationalize them as people who have achieved the American Dream.  Good for them.  Keep working hard.\n\n2) Poor people.  We rationalize them as people who aren't working hard and therefore have not achieved, and will likely never achieve, the American Dream.\n\nSo we have upper, middle, and lower classes, and everything seems fine as long as we don't think about it too much.  And keep working.  It's a holdover from 1950s thinking, where we rode this magnificent economical wave of wealth for a whole generation, and came up with this philosophy.  It's mostly a conservative philosophy, because American conservatism is the philosophy of keeping everything the same.  Never change anything, keep everything as-is.\n\nThis starts to be incongruent with the real world when you realize that the children of the 1950s, the American baby boomers, were only children when they experienced this spoiled, fattened calf of a time period, and they don't realize that it was born of imperialism, espionage, political sabotage, and incredibly high taxes.\n\nSo with this mindset you can understand how socialism, which they understand as the government wanting to redistribute wealth among people, has become a meaningless, vile word.  You can understand how any conversation of taxes or foreign aid is met with disgust.  And you can see how they are hesitant to help others.  There are an alarmingly high number of people here that truly believe that wealth and success just comes if you work hard, without so much as a critical thought such as, \"but wait, aren't things like factory workers necessary in the world and does that mean they just should settle for having not achieved the American Dream?\"",

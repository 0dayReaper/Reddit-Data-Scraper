    "postText": "Im scared I don\u2019t know what to do I feel so confused and manipulated.. I\u2019m lost.\n\nSo I have heart failure and am working on trying to get a heart transplant. I recently moved out of my abusive moms into my dads- and it hasn\u2019t gone good. I do cardiac rehab 3x a week Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. \n\nThis all started on Tuesday. I came home from hanging out with my brother and my dad asked me if tomorrow morning I could help the kids (I live with a 5, 8 and 12 year old) mop the floor. We have a swiffer. I agreed and went on with my day. I went to bed as usual and woke up at 9:30 am and went out to help. The 12 year old had the 5 and 8 year old help clean and they finished all of it. I asked if there was anything I could do or help out with. They said no so I went back to bed. I went to cardiac rehab the same day. And when I got home my dad scolded me for not helping them cleans he acknowledged it wasn\u2019t entirely my fault but scolded me. He told me in return to clean the bathroom. I had felt awful from rehab and I told him I physically couldn\u2019t do it. He said he wanted it done anyway. Even if I have to mop, take a break, etc, so I didn\u2019t argue and I went to rest. I slept until 10 and woke up, knowing I still had to clean the bathroom or else my dad would get mad. I got up and I cleaned. I still felt awful, and as I know my bodies limits o was right, I pushed myself too far. And I felt awful after cleaning, and ended up vomiting at 1am. \n\nThe next day I had cardiac rehab again and I physically couldn\u2019t do it my oxygen was also at 68% I told them what had happened and I had to sit on oxygen for an hour. They then called my doctors and I went on with my day \n\nFriday comes around and my doctors call me to clarify to me what had happened, before calling my dad my dad seemed understanding over the phone but as soon as he hung up he complained saying. \u201cI only made her tidy I barley made her do anything, what she did wasn\u2019t that hard\u201d stuff like that. \n\nHe then also scolded me later on for \u2018running my mouth to my doctors\u2019 \n\nMonday rolls around and I talk to my cardiac rehab team with my grandpa and they decide to call CPS on my dad. There\u2019s also been other instances. For example I had been bloated and swelled from steroids I had to take due to an infection I had. My dad told me not to go to cardiac rehab while bloated because \u201ccardiac rehab will call your doctors and you doctors will bitch at me\u201d \n\nAnother example is I had trash pile up due to me being sick. When I finally took it out my dad said \u201csee that wasn\u2019t that hard,  it\u2019s not hard to take trash out\u201d I explained it may be easy for him but for me it\u2019s 10x harder because I\u2019m disabled he simply responded \u201cit\u2019s not that hard\u201d \n\nHe also is constantly telling me \u201cI have it easy, he gives more shit to the other kids , I do the bare minimum\u201d and more like that \n\nWell CPS now had an active case and my dad isn\u2019t very happy he\u2019s telling me I cannot talk to my doctors alone, my grandma has to be in the room at all times so no more private convos and even worse he\u2019s telling me \u201cyou\u2019re over exaggerating things, you could\u2019ve told me and I wouldn\u2019t of made you do it or told you to do it tomorrow (I told him I couldn\u2019t do it physically). You could\u2019ve just did it tomorrow I wouldn\u2019t of been mad, I\u2019ve never yelled at you you\u2019ve never gotten in trouble for something you couldn\u2019t do, your grandma has to be in there when you talk to CPS she can\u2019t leave you can either have a good summer or a bad summer depending on what you tell this lady, I never medically neglected you if you tell this lady an over exaggerated story, if you lie you\u2019ll be sent to a foster home, with strangers when I tried to explain to him what happened that day he got angry at me for supposedly \u201ctelling him he was lying\u201d and that he asked me to do it when I didn\u2019t have cardiac rehab and I did it on the day I did or that I did it the day after that (he asked me to do it the day I had cardiac rehab) he says I stay up all night and I woke up at 3am to do it (which isn\u2019t true) he\u2019s also been complaining about my doctors getting involved with CPS and this case \n\n\nI just feel so confused and hopeless maybe I\u2019m over exaggerating maybe I\u2019m a bad person or a bad daughter maybe I do have it good and I\u2019m just over exaggerating in scared I\u2019m confused I\u2019m lost I don\u2019t know what to do I also feel like I\u2019m being manipulated but I can\u2019t talk to anyone because all of my family kisses his ass I\u2019m just lost and scared",

For child protectice services to be involved I'm guessing mid teens (I'm sorry you have to go in for treatment like this at such a young age btw).\n\n\nIt's good you realise how bad this is, but instead of asking about manipilation, you need to be aware it's abuse. I'm half way through reading, so may edit in a minute after finishing.\n\n\nEdit: After reading, yeah, he's a prick. Your Dad is not meant to coerce/intimidate you into giving answers that benefit him into an investigstion that favours him. It's just so wrong.\n\n\n\nYou're not a bad person/daughter, you're not overdramatic, overreacting &amp; having it good/easy is not the circumstance you're in. A grown man doesn't treat their sick kid like this, ever.\n\n\nI'm an ex foster kid myself, bad parents do exist, I know from my own experience &amp; I'm sorry, but anyone deserves so much better than that, no matter age, gender etc.",

And everytime he runs across people he knows he always glares or gives a dirty look. Not many people are fond of him.. they all say he\u2019s a dick. Just I\u2019m a people pleaser and when I hear someone\u2019s other perspective even if it\u2019s twisted to make them better I can\u2019t help but to feel guilty for thinking they were a bad person.. I Just it\u2019s hard and I\u2019m confused.. and o feel like I\u2019m over exaggerating and overexaggeratint my condition and what I physically can do",

He's already making you doubt yourself if you think you're over exaggerating.\n\n\nYou're trying to get a replacement heart, it's major surgery &amp; people don't open investigations into really small things. You're 17, so it's good that you hopefully should be able to get out of that scenario soon.\n\n\nWhat you need to be doing is talking honestly about your scenario for both yourself &amp; if your siblings are suffering, them.\n\n\nI'm honestly really sorry, it's beyond unfair for a teenager to be dealing with something medically like you are, alongside an adult behaving so badly.\n\n\nI'm 27 &amp; I promise it gets so much better leaving bad scenarios like that, even if it takes a while to process it. I've been recently processing things from when I was a kid even as someone a decade older than you.\n\n\nReally not sure what else to write, good luck with your treatment, wish I could somehow do something.",

CPS will do an investigation for I think 60 or 90 days. During that time you will be interviewed alone, and so will many people around you, including the other children. CPS is going to shake things up and it\u2019s important you ask for what you need. If your caretakers are cruel, gaslighting, manipulating you, if you feel unsafe you need to tell your story to someone so that your best interests will be met. Thank you for reaching out. You will find what you need. Just keep up your efforts and with a healthy environment I pray you will flourish and grow strong and begin to see a change for the better.",

A selfish one sees it that way.\n\nHeart failure at your age is a serious and troubling thing for anyone to go through and a supportive person is not what you got. Is the heart failure seen as some sort of character failure on his part? Is he trying misguidedly to 'coach' you into putting more effort into your day to day activities?\n\nI understand where you are coming from having myself lived through a heart failure situation where a slow walk was all I could do in the way of 'exercise' before the angina kicked in. In my case it was a quintuple bypass during a smaller heart attack that resolved the situation.\n\nReading between the lines I am assuming you have some congenital heart problem that cannot be treated by traditional stent or bypass surgery or various valve jobs, and not a severe obesity problem which also makes the usual surgical  procedures too risky to begin with.\n\nso as to the question are you being Manipulated?  yes.\n\nAnd what is the point of this manipulation? \n\nWhat end result situation is he seeking? \n\nIs there a way to afford the medical procedures?\n\nWhat are his positions on these issues? Does he even think you have a heart issue.",

There is no one rule.\n\nSee: The movie Django Unchained, which uses the n-word around 100 times, uncensored, spoken by white characters, only about a decade ago. This was in theaters. You could just walk up to the ticket counter, pick a time and seat, and go see it.",

Subscription services are not subject to these guidelines at all, and are allowed to self-regulate.",

Let's say that NPR decided to do a broadcast about the history of black civil rights, and includes a recording of speech that contains the n-word. In this context, it would likely be permissible, even though it's considered some of the strongest language around, because it's for educational purposes and there wasn't intent to offend.\n\nTheoretically, you could broadcast something *extremely* offensive without using swears or slurs at all.",

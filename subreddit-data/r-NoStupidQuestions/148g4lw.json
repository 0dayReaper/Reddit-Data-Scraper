Why are you looking?  How is this any of your business?\n\nYou live your life, I'll live mine.\n\nWhy does it need to be labeled a \"trend?\"  Why does there have to be a reason for it?\n\nWhat if I just felt like painting my nails today?\n\nIt doesn't concern you.  Its fine to notice it, because obviously people are going to notice when someone's nails are an unnatural color.  That's fine.  Basic perception and observation is fine.\n\nBut when you take to public forums to make a big deal about it, you're immediately wrong because you're calling attention to something from other people, and its none of anyone's business except the person who's body the nails are attached to.\n\nNo matter how you spin this, coming to a public forum and being like \"what's the deal with xyz?\" is exclusive and derogatory.  You are, probably without even knowing it, singling out a person because of a choice they've made about their own body.\n\nStop doing this.\n\nIts not your body.\n\nYou don't get to ask these kinds of questions.",

I'm sure there are many men who never cared before and have always worn nail polish because they liked it. I think there are also many men who now feel more able to express their fashion/creativity through nail polish when they felt that there was previously stigma but now there is less, or maybe they have gained confidence and overcome self consciousness.\n\nThere is nothing inherently negative about having a discussion about something you have observed about people.",

I (M) painted my nails once as a kid and took SO MUCH SHIT that I hid in a closet and cried for half the day. Now, almost 30 years later, enough dudes are doing it that it\u2019s becoming normal and I probably wouldn\u2019t be an instant pariah if I did it today. Representation matters.",

Everyone should be stupid and self-centered! /s\n\nEdit: your comment history explains a lot. Besides the judginess and entitlement, faking that you love your son but caring that much about someone asking a question about guys wearing nail polish is next level. Jesus\u2026",

Pride is about acceptance, and some people feel emboldened to do things they didn't dare before, such as wearing nail polish. Also possibly to show their allyship or rally for men wearing nail polish being commonplace, but I'm not sure about that.",

It\u2019s the noun that gets put into plural. \n\nUsually in English, adjectives or phrases functioning as adjectives come before the noun, and there\u2019s no debate about the plural. If instead of \u201chole in one\u201d we said \u201cone-stroke hole\u201d, you\u2019d say right away that the plural is \u201cone stroke holes\u201d. But hole-in-one is an idiom that puts the phrase functioning as an adjective after the noun.  So we still make the noun, in this case \u201chole\u201d into the plural.",

Unfortunately it usually says a lot about the person and they usually have some pretty big issues with themselves. \n\nBut for you, it\u2019s more about who you surround yourself with. Surround yourself with kind, fun people and you will be happier for it. Help those being bullied but don\u2019t pay attention to the bullies.",

            "comment": "Here\u2019s a flawed metaphor I use to visualize my existential sadness: \n\nSome people see a square, they know there\u2019s four sides, they know what side they stand on, the vaguely know their actions have consequences but from where they\u2019re standing nothing especially awful has changed so they assume they\u2019re fine.\n\nSome people look and see a cube. They see the one face that other persons standing in front of, they see the faces on either side. They spend time walking around the cube observing it from different angles and different perspectives. And they notice that when they\u2019re on the opposite side of the cube and that person\u2019s spewing hateful things across their square that a heap of hate is pouring over the other sides of the cube and suddenly they\u2019re standing in a sea of sadness and hate, completely unbeknownst to the square people. \n\nIt can feel impossible shouting into the void, trying to explain the three dimensions of this cube to the square people. But they don\u2019t see it that way. You try and explain all the 6 faces of the cube, but they think you\u2019re overcomplicating it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a square, there\u2019s just four sides\u201d \n\nFrom the other perspective how frustrating it is as a square person trying to talk to a cube person. It\u2019s there it\u2019s right there, but they don\u2019t see what you\u2019re talking about. They\u2019ve drifted off to a completely different square, we haven\u2019t finished talking about this one yet. I bet it feels disrespectful even, the way they\u2019re always changing the subject and not answering your specific question.",

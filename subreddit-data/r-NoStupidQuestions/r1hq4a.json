She\u2019s not talking to me now but if you read this Hunny, I told you it was weird.\n\nEdit 2: My wife isn\u2019t mad everyone lol, she\u2019s more upset/surprised that the majority agrees weird . Some on Reddit need to realize not every married couple turns everything into a fight. We both had a great morning of laughs over this. Some on Reddit also need to realize just because something is weird doesn\u2019t mean it requires mental health professionals lol. While I think she\u2019s weird for it, it\u2019s really not a big deal. They\u2019re her kids she carried and she can keep whatever body pieces she wants. I will however of course start storing used baby wipes from changing the newborn in my closet in a chest for her to find.",

I think in particular after they'd died, as a memorial, but I'm sure it wasn't exclusive to that. The art I saw in person (in a museum) was embroidery but people have done all kinds of things with it. Specifically they'd used hair from everyone in their family to embroider something about their family. A family tree maybe? It's been a while. It takes all kinds of forms though, you can look it up if you're interested and the idea of human hair art doesn't gross you out. Hair lasts a long time. Probably way more commonly known is people giving locks of their hair as a token. So, think of it like that maybe and it gets less weird?",

I'm studying forensic pathology, autopsy science, and forensic nursing atm so dead things are my jam.\n\n\n\nMy cats are all freeze dried. I go to a specific guy (professional) that exclusively handles freeze drying people's pets. However, I do own other pieces of taxidermy separate from my pets that are traditional taxidermy, not freeze dried.\n\n\n\nOf the four of my freeze dried pet cats, they're mounted in different ways. One is like she's sleeping, and the rest are soft mounts. For one of them I took a recording of her meowing and got it put into the platform she's on. It's motion sensored so every time someone walks by she meows. I'll pet and occasionally cuddle my passed pets, but I mostly talk to them. Sometimes my husband tells the cat that meows to knock it off when he walks by.\n\n\n\nI've always been interested in taxidermy and the process behind it. I'd love to learn how to do it myself, too. I've also just been into dead stuff and decomposition since I was a kid. I had a couple people in my life die super young and in traumatic ways and am working with a therapist on my trauma surrounding death. Keeping the pets I've lost close to me and in a way I can still cuddle them makes me feel a lot better and helps me cope with my issues surrounding loss.\n\n\n\nAnd before anyone asks no, I'm not into necrophilia, I'm not a psychopath/sociopath, I would never harm animals or people, I don't want to make taxidermy people. I'm just very very weird.",

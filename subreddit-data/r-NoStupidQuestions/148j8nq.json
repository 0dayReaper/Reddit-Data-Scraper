    "postText": "I\u2019m 23F and I just want to be more involved with my parents, do stuff with them, have fun and make good memories. But I don\u2019t know how as stupid as it sounds. \nMy mom basically works two jobs and my dad is busy with his. He goes to gym and I\u2019ve started doing that with him! But at night when they\u2019re done working they just watch some tv and stuff.\nBut I recently picked up my dad from dropping his rental car off and I realized that we didn\u2019t have much to talk about or anything and it made me realize that as loving and supportive as my parents are they\u2019re not great at fun. None of them really have time for hobbies and I feel like nothing to REALLY bond with them. \n\nWhat sort of things could I try to do with them? Should I try and talk with them?",

I try get them to play games like Mario kart  and all but my mom get easily frustrated (thus uninterested) and my dad is neutral but again not super interested. There\u2019s other card games that we play but some require 4 players or they\u2019re bored of the game bc it\u2019s the same 3 games they play. Where I\u2019m at in the states there\u2019s honestly not much to do for activities that my mom can do, she has a bad knee. \nI\u2019m sorry, I hope it doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m making constant excuses, but this is where I feel lost. I try to do things with them that I enjoy but they\u2019re either neutral or uninterested in the activity and I have a hard time doing things they like to do bc there\u2019s not much they do like to do or they\u2019re too busy or something.",

If Mom was washing the dishes then I would grab the drying towel, or help hang the washing with her. If Dad was washing the car I would grab a sponge. I found the \"doing\" stuff was a gentle way to figure each other out again. For me it helped open up to proper verbal communication. And then you can start having fun. Good luck as parents are very cool and they get old a lot quicker then we like to think.",

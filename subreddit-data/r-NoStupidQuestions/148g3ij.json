    "postText": "So we have a Cop that lives in our complex, never spoke to him, haven\u2019t had the chance don\u2019t really care I just keep to myself.. one day my girlfriend called me panicked saying that the same exact car his wife drives with him in it and followed her to work, so much so it was from inside our front complex gate, following 4 turns before getting on the highway then switching lanes twice ( with it still following ) then getting off, two more turns and followed a U turn.. I mentioned it to our complex office and the next thing you know his wife is following my girlfriend from our complex pool half way to our apartment runs up to her and says \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you\u201d she starts yelling and screaming at my girlfriend.. \nnow I\u2019m all for conversation but when a woman starts yelling and screaming belligerently there\u2019s something that just makes me tone them completely out .. anyway honestly all we want is for them to leave us alone, what should we do? \nI\u2019m debating even complaining to the office again, my girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to file a police report. But if this happens again I will be calling the police department.",

Not 911, but the non-emergency line. Tell them you need to speak with internal affairs, as you may have a rogue cop pursuing you extralegally, and you need to report this higher up the totem pole than a citizen's complaint.\n\nMost police organizations \\*will\\* have an internal affairs or similar department. Don't let them tell you otherwise.\n\nGoogle: \"how can I speak with internal affairs with \\[MA\\] police\" &lt;-- Replace your state\n\nExample: MA Internal affairs: [https://springfieldmapolice.com/internal-investigation-unit/](https://springfieldmapolice.com/internal-investigation-unit/)\n\nBe brave and be specific. There are no details too small to discuss. \n\nGood luck, and may the literal \"force\" be with you on this.\n\nom",

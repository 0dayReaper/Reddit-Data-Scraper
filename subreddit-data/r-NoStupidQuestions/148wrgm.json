A crazy thing is that if they don't learn any language before a certain age (like puberty I think?) those wires/connectors in their brain are just kind of re-absorbed into the brain and they can never become fully fluent in any language even if they're reintroduced into human society later on. They can still start to learn language and communicate just never at the normal fluent level we take for granted.",

These things are tricky to measure because a conflicted person's views can change very fast. However, I will say that the number of closeted agnostics and aethiests is probably a lot higher than we assume them to be.",

They aren\u2019t positively claiming anything by definition.\n\nTheism is about belief. \nGnosticism is about knowledge. \nYou can believe something despite of knowledge or you can believe without knowledge. They aren\u2019t the same thing.\n\nSo being agnostic just means you accept that you don\u2019t know. Atheism is not believing any positive claims about god. But it doesn\u2019t mean you assert anything yourself. \n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of:\n\nPerson: I have an imaginary friend.\nAtheist: I don\u2019t believe in your imaginary friend.\n\nThe atheist cannot disprove it, but sees no justification for believing the claim.\n\nTo assert that no god exists (as in to positively claim that no god exists), would be more along the lines of antitheism, which is rare",

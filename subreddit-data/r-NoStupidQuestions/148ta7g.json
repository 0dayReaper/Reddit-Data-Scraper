I don't know anything about this religion other than the fact that people claim it's an evil cult.. what do I do?\n\n\n\n\nEdit - I'm not a very religious person at all, but I do believe in God and I do pray so joining was never even an option in my mind. I guess I was more curious to know whether or not it's still possible to be with a person that is in scientology. Judging by the comments- I know the unfortunate answer to this now, but the whole situation is scary and I don't really know how to go about cutting things off with him. This whole situation has me very paranoid.",

The days where they could hide their practices are long gone; there have been many documentaries lately about them, exposing some very disturbing things. \n\nScientologists are actually forbidden from being in relationships with people who are _not_ Scientologists.

            "comment": "You need to reach out to the Aftermath foundation to get some support.\n\nScientology isn't just an evil cult. At the early levels, they want your money, and they want to help you. Their idea of help isn't super rational, because it's faith driven. It creates a strong sense of community, though, which is very easy for people to appreciate. I mean, you have a community, you have support, and you have friends. What's not to love?\n\nThat's when the high pressure sales tactics start. Buy the next book, buy the next course. And honestly, for some people, these courses are good things. They can teach you how to organize your thoughts and feelings. Auditing even kinda looks like therapy.\n\nAs you get deeper, the pressure increases. You keep paying for more and more courses. The church encourages you to max out your credit cards and empty your savings. Pay for more books, more courses, attend more events. But you are moving up the bridge to understanding.\n\nEventually, your finances start to look bad. But they have an option for you! Join the Sea Org. No bills, no costs. They supply everything. You live in a community barracks, you eat at a community cafeteria, and you work for them. For the next billion years.\n\nYour auditing is all recorded, and people know everything about you. You have to get permission to physically leave the compound. If you are trouble, you can be put in a low quality home near an unpleasant areA (on the compound) and forbidden to interact with others until you work out your problems. You are also given harsh physical labour.\n\nIf you are good, thorough, you work 18 hour days, seven days a week, for the good of all existence, for 50 dollars a week. For the rest of your life.\n\nMedical care is forbidden. There are no sick days. Illness is caused by your failures as a spiritual being. Serious illness is treated by being locked in a cell until you realize what you did wrong and work it out in an auditing session. \n\nMembers of the Sea Org can marry, but cannot have children without leaving the Sea Org. Remember, though, that you have no money, no savings, no safety net, and haven't been in the job market for years. How do you support a kid anyway?\n\nSo you work, and Scientology takes every penny, until you die.",

Agents of Scientology are known to have attempted to murder investigative journalists researching the group *at the direction of the Scientology leadership*, and these actions have never been apologised for, rejected, condemned or even forsworn by *any* Scientology leadership. I'm sorry, but murder is WRONG, and any group that supports murder is WRONG.\n\n- rejects mental health conditions as medical conditions.  It instructs its members to refuse psychiatric care and to not take mental health measures, including medication. Persons who became Scientologists often report worsening mental health with no relief. There have been suicides.\n\n- Scientologists don't support standard education.  Many persons raised within Scientology report that they are taught reading, writing and basic arithmetic before being sent to do adult labour within Scientologist properties.\n\n\nThose are just what I can think of off the top of my head.

I just moved to a new state and my old insurance is not valid in this state so i gotta find new insurance, but I only have like 70 dollars to my name right now. I am trying to find a job super fast, though. I mean, what's the worst that can happen to me? Even on the meds I still get depressed or struggle with my anxiety anyway",

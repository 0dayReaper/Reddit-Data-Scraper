            "comment": "Going by tailors I think they measure around your gut rather than under. Although I think even that is up to a certain size only. Personally I find it extremely uncomfortable so I am an under the gut wearer. I just came to terms with the fact that no matter how I spin it, my size cannot be hidden or faked so I wear what\u2019s comfortable to me. But anyway, did some google and essentially once you reach beer belly stage you won\u2019t have a waistline anymore so if you are like me, 6\u2019 350lbs - you likely wear it under. I think women are different as I see a lot of bigger women wearing their gut inside. To me that makes it actually look worse.",

It is not the spindles that move the tape, it is the capstan and pinch roller.\n\nSince the capstan and pinch roller move the tape where it is flat, it does not change speed when the rolls change diameter.  There is a motor moving the take up side of the cassette but it runs just enough to keep tension, it does not govern how fast the tape moves.",

The motor always runs faster than really needed to ensure that tape is wound properly independent of how much tape is on either side.",

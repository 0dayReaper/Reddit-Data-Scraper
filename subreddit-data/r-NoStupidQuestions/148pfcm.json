Use case is definitely a deciding factor when it comes to language, but there's a lot of other deciding factors.\n\nCRM is a pretty generic and basic application of software, so there's not really a need to single out any language specifically for any major advantages. \n\nYou'd probably be looking for a language with:\n\n- Easy UI development for something that looks nice and is easy to use\n\n\n- Object orientation to easily separate and interface entities with each other during development\n\n\n- Probably something Web based at this point, there's a lot of legacy native applications but not too many new ones. Even when developing for native applications, most of the logic sits behind an API as it minimises the amount of work required when working with multiple platforms",

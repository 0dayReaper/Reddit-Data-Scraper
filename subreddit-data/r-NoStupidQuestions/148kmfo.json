Is it better to rehome them before it happens or is leaving a specific location in a will usually enough?\n\nEdit for clarity: the person is terminal, not the pet.",

It was decided well before hand, the dog stayed with the person until it became too much, then it went home with the new owner.\n\nMy wife made a similar agreement with a lady our grand-daughter knows, we are the designated home for the dog if that should ever be needed.  She is not terminal, just elderly, and knows the dog will outlast her.  We have had the dog for a night here and there, and have spent time with the dog and her, so she feels good about leaving it with us.\n\nMuch tougher though if you can not find a solution yourself, and have to rely on a shelter or let someone else decide what to do.",

There are too many potential relationships I let get away with really awesome girls because I was too much of a coward to make the first move. He may say yes, he may say no. Regardless, open communication is the way forward. Making the first move is absolutely okay and you\u2019ll save yourself the awkwardness of the \u201ctalking\u201d phase where neither of you know where the relationship stands and don\u2019t want to change it out of fear of things being awkward.",

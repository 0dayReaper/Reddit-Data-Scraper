    "postText": "Hi Reddit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about three months ago, I was on a trip in my car and hit a pothole which caused a flat in my front driver side tire. I visited a local Discount Tire and decided to have both front tires replaced, but kept both my rear as they had a 4-5 months of life left and didn't really want to spend the extra $500 at the time. Well, I won't ever do this again. Now that I want to replace my rear tires, I tried to visit Discount Tire and was told that this specific tire was discontinued. They suggested getting two similar tires for the rear, but I'd rather not have two sets of different tires. I've searched online everywhere and local shops, and nobody carries it. Do I just take the L and replace all four tires with the same brand, or risk getting a similar set? For context, I have a 2020 Honda Civic Sport Hatchback so I'd like the car to have a decent set of tires for \"performance.\" I've certainly learned my lesson.",

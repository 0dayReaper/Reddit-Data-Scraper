    "postText": "So... I'll keep this simple. I have a wall with two different outlets on it, on other ends of the wall. Each has two plugs. One outlet has my PC plugged in, and my monitors into an extension cord. I want to make sure that plugging an extension cord into the other outlet (other side of the same wall) for my TV power and Nintendo Switch dock would not be damaging.\n\nMy wall looks like this, if it helps.\n-----[:]-------[:]---\nThe wall, in total, is 15 ft or less. [:] represents each outlet. One has my PC equipment + one extension cord.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the help!! I appreciate it a lot. Honestly, worst case scenario, I use a monitor as my TV temporarily, since the main use for it was my Amazon Fire Stick for shows and my Switch for games.\n\nComputer runs with an Intel Core i9-12900k and a RTX 3070 (three monitors). Work computer is an Intel Core i3-9100T (two monitors) and is plugged in across the room. TV is an older Samsung TV with a Nintendo Switch and Fire Stick. None of the three devices are ever on simultaneously.\n\n-\nDisabling notifications, thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "How many monitors?  Home current works on circuits.   Each circuit goes into one breaker on a breaker box and is rated for a certain amount of power.  And you can only put a certain number of outlets, lights, etc per circuit.  Overload the power drain and the circuit breaker trips.\n\nPlugging one thing into each outlet (and two outlets is two outlets) will never trip the breaker, if everything is working right, labeled right, up to code, and not shorting out.  But we all plug more than one thing into at least one of our outlets using a power strip.  And all of that adds up to fill up the circuit no matter how you spread it out among the outlets.   If you have a lot of huge monitors and a massively overclocked computer, that is a lot of electricity.\n\nStill, if you turn off your monitors before you turn on your TV and switch, I think that would be fine.  And the effect of overloading would be to trip the breaker and you would lose what you were working on and have to reset the breaker switch, but you would be unlikely to do actual damage.",

I also have a separate work computer, which does not use as much electricity, but I never have it on at the same time as my other computer (and it's also on another wall, although in the same room and through the same breaker). \n\nThank you for the great advice! :)",

            "comment": "It depends on a lot of things. Are both outlets connected to the same breaker? If yes then you\u2019re limited to the wattage capacity of that breaker. It varies by country, but average in the US is for a regular 15 amp breaker to handle 1800 to 2000 watts. If all devices connected to that breaker (regardless of how many extensions or outlets) exceed that capacity, then you\u2019ll overload the system and that\u2019s dangerous. You can check the watt ratings of each device either on their packaging or usually written on the devices themselves.\n\nIf each outlet is connected to a separate breaker, then individually they can each handle the max 1800 ~ 2000 watts on their own.",

If you get 0v on the DMM, it's the same phase. \n\n Just connecting extension cords isn't an issue; what matters is the load that you're powering.",

            "comment": "Don\u2019t plug one extension cord into another. As long as all your power cords are thick enough for the amount of power your devices will draw, and as long as all your devices don\u2019t use too much power, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nI assume the outlets in your room are part of the same circuit. If you live in the US, that means that all your devices in that room can safely draw up to 1,500 watts simultaneously (1,800 for a very short time). Maybe more, but that\u2019s not guaranteed. In Europe, that figure would be closer to 3,000 watts.\n\nIf you have a PC with a powerful CPU and a RTX 4090, for instance, that PC alone might draw more than a 1,000 watts. Add a space heater in the winter (another 900 watts or so), and you might trip your breaker.\n\nBut usually, you don\u2019t have your powerful PC running at the same time as all other devices on maximum load, so you should be fine.",

Your PC should be well below 600 watts, add 150 for a **really** big monitor and maybe another 20-100 or so for speakers (depending on size), and you can probably run your PC under full load as well as some lights and an A/C on the same circuit simultaneouslywithout any issues.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, your breaker will trip. That usually doesn't ruin anything, although, if you're unlucky, it might.\n\nMuch more dangerous is using cheap or underspecced extension cords, or plugging multiple extension cords into one another. **Never** do that.",

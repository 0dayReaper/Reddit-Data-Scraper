    "postText": "I'm a guy, and am early 20's. I have only had 1 girlfriend in my life and she ended up cheating on me. I've tried using dating apps and get barely any attention. I've also been told by a friend of mine that I give off gay vibes.\n\nMy ears are pierced, and I have an eyebrow piercing, I have a few tattoos. I used to have shoulder length hair but now its swooped over the eyes, some have called it \"anime hair\". I have facial hair, I keep it trimmed. I'm skinny, but aren't necessarily a twig. I wear chains/necklaces, occasionally bracelets, and occasionally a ring. I've been told by my friend that I give off gay vibes because of how I stand, or if I make some hand gestures. Outside of work I generally dress in just a hoodie or something. I have these ripped white jeans that I like to wear. And I wear my timberland boots occasionally\n\nI'm straight, there's nothing wrong with being gay but its just not me",

On tinder not getting likes can be related to your pictures, your bio and other things. People are hesitant of the following\n\n-Less than 3 different photos in different places\n-Filters on photos\n-Too professional looking pics\n-Not smiling/looking inviting\n-No bio\n-Rude bio\n-incomplete bio\n-Short bio\n-Overly long bio\n-Smokers (don't lie about this it's pointless she will just get on the date and smell the smoke on you and she will know)\n-No career/Education or plans of either\n-Not listing hobbies or interests\n-people who seem unsure about what kind of relationship they want for example looking for short term open to long term is just a big I don't know what I want.\n-No I'm not active here message me on X or if it's a superlike it's an accident these read as arrogant\n\nThere other things too like if your 19 and have that you want a family your axing out instantly alot of women who don't. That's fine if that's a deal breaker but you get my point here.\n\nUltimately from my female friends I noticed they are much more likely to read the bio and even read bios of men who's profile photo they didn't find attractive so I would focus on that especially since that's in your control. These findings are of course highly subjective. \n\nBut remember people are looking through alot of profiles you want your bio to make them smile a little.",

Best place to meet like minded people in general is while doing something you enjoy. \n\nBy the way. Couples meet at work and at class all the time. Does that mean you should hit on every woman you like at these places? Obviously not. Like you said, woman don't like that. But are you making friends at these places? Are you socializing? All it takes is for you to find the right person and you won't have to \"hit on them\". A relationship will form naturally. Of course it's all a numbers game and it's hard to find a person like that. Which is why you don't worry about any of that nonsense and just live your life.",

It\u2019s not like it changes your personality. \n\nNow if people are acting flamboyant because they feel like they need to to fit it, or there\u2019s people restricting themselves from doing so because they feel like they need to fit in, that changes things because then *people are forcing themselves to conform to a stereotype*. That\u2019s different than their true personalities. \n\nIf you had a room of 100 gay dudes, and a room of 100 straight dudes, ideally there\u2019s no difference at all. Gay and straight people aren\u2019t any different. The only reason there *might* be a difference, is that flamboyance is a stereotype in the first place. So some straights, being afraid to seem gay, suppress the tendency to act flamboyant in order to \u201cfit in\u201d. And similarly there\u2019s some gays, who want to \u201cfit in\u201d, and try their best to fit the stereotype.   \n\nWe need to fight against the stereotype because it prevents *all* groups from being true to themselves.",

He disclosed pretty early on (and pretty casually) that he\u2019s bi. I thought \u201cThat\u2019s hot.\u201d We just moved in together after 5 years.

That\u2019s what happened every time for my bf lmaoooo.",

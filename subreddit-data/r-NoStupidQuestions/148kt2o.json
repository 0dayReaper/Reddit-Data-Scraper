Yes Uteruses have been successfully transplanted before and babies have then come from those transplanted uteruses long after the surgery.\n\nBut attempting one with a baby IN the uterus would put waaayyy too much stress on the baby. It is a major surgery.\n\nThe baby would probably have much better chances being removed from the womb like in a C-section and being cared for in a NICU like very premature babies are",

            "comment": "Removing a uterus, a hysterectomy, is a major surgery (just had one, it\u2019s not easy) and there are major veins and blood vessels involved. The trauma of disconnecting the uterus from its major blood supplies could be enough to kick off early labor. A woman\u2019s body, first and foremost, will try to protect itself. In a way, this is why some miscarriages happen. So there\u2019d be a huge risk to disrupting that environment. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how an artificial situation would even occur but transplanting it into another woman causes major risks to the baby. Any time a transplant happens, there are heavy, serious anti-rejection drugs involved which lower the immune system so it doesn\u2019t attack the new tissue. I have a feeling those drugs are toxic to a fetus or run the risk of lowering the new mother\u2019s immune system so much that she may be very ill and unable to carry the baby. There\u2019s a reason why doctors try not to do any sort of surgery on pregnant women unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.",

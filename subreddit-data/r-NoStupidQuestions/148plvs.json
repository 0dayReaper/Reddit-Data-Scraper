Upper management like refuses to leave work if they're sick so I'm the last 6 months I've been sick at LEAST 5 times. I take my vitamins, I eat healthy, my own home is clean, I go to the gym regularly but these people INSIST on coming in sick because they're cOmPAnY mEn &amp; wOmEn. Would wearing a mask help at all?",

But it's only droplets for the first few seconds after it leaves your mouth.  Once it dries up and becomes airborne particles, then no, masks won't help at all, they are just a placebo at that point.",

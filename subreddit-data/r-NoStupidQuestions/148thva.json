You aren't with holding special water and making the cat drink stinky water. \n\nYou can try a cat fountain or moving the water dish to another spot. I guarantee the cat will eventually drink the water though. I'd drink water out of a puddle in the street if I was thirsty enough. Your cat will be the same. It's just got a habit that needs broken. It's not cruel because you're giving the cat fresh water. It's on the cat at that point.",

The water in the dish is totally fine. \n\nI have a mastiff that insisted on putting his gigantic ass head up to the kitchen tap, seemed comical... dog stands flatfooted on kitchen floor and drinks from kitchen tap. Pretty soon that's all he wanted, wouldn't touch the water bowl. Had to stop because the gross factor soon overwhelmed the comedic value. For a while he'd ignore the water bowl, stand by the sink looking all cute and thirsty... had to remind myself not to let him train me. He's been drinking from the bowl for a good long time now, never gives me any grief about the sink anymore.",

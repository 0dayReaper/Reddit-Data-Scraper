            "comment": "That's a really broad question, and will differ on the style of music.\n\nEven just in western music, classical, jazz, and blues harmony are all pretty distinct even though we typically use the classical vocabulary to describe them.\n\nGenerally speaking, you are going to be looking to use harmony to build and release tension. How you go about that, is again going to depend heavily on your style of music.\n\nHarmonic intervals that are further away from whole number ratios of frequency are going to sound more \"tense\" or dissonant. Follow those up with more consonant intervals, and you feel release.\n\nThe initial steps are going to be determining which chords are diatonic to your key. For example, C major consists of the tones C,D,E,F,G,A,B with no accidentals. The chords that are built from those are C (CEG), D minor (DFA), E minor (EGB), F (FAC), G7 *also called dominant* (GBDF), A minor (ACE), and B diminished (don't worry about this one until you have a good grip on harmony, it is very ugly if not used correctly). There are also other kinds of chords, but for those usually also have special use cases. Musicians will often use the number of the scale degree to communicate chords across keys. In the case of C major, 1 for C, 2 for D, etc. There is also roman numeral notation that is commonly used, with capital and lower case being used to signify major and minor chords, I, ii, iii, IV, V7, vi, vii diminished.\n\nSome very popular progressions will include a cadence. That is, going from a chord built on the 4th or 5th degree of a scale to the root chord of the key. This often called a resolution when it goes back to the root chord. Then you will either lead into that cadence or move in smaller steps to and from them.\n\nIn Jazz, you'll get a lot of what's called a 2-5-1. In pop music, there is a ton of some variation on 1-4-6-5. Classic 12 bar blues heavily leans on dominant 1-4-5.\n\nThen you have other non-diatonic chords... inversions, suspensions, dominant substitutions, borrowed chords, parallel modes... Harmony is complicated.",

                            "comment": "So your mileage is going to vary a lot, then. All of those styles are going to rely on sounds that are heavily distorted or digitally manipulated, so some progressions are going to sound more tense because the fundamental frequencies aren't going to have the natural resonances.\n\nTry starting out using just the root and fifth of the chords. Those are called power chords in the rock world, and they strip out everything except the most consonant interval because effects and distortion add a lot of harmonic information. Then you can add the major or minor 3rd and other scale degrees in as you like them to fill out the harmonic space.\n\nGood luck!",

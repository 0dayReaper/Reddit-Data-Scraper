Those banners that would say \"YOU'RE THE 1,000,000th VISITOR, CLICK HERE TO CLAIM YOUR FREE IPOD!\" and stuff like that. Signing up for free trials, doing all the pop-up surveys, and and following every rabbit hole. Most of them were bogus, but like once a week he'd actually get something sent to him in the mail that was legit. He had a bunch of cool gadgets because of it, many of them for sale at school. Things like the newest motorolla phones, or a free copy of a video game, or a gift card to somewhere kids didn't care about like Pier 1 Imports. He even sold them or gave them teachers. I'm not sure if it was ever worth all the effort but it was interesting to see that it sometimes worked and all of that clickbait wasn't necessarily BS. Probably 10% of it was real if you took the time to do it.",

I know someone who works in ads and have discussed with them whether the entire field of advertising is simply a giant bubble. I\u2019ve since adopted a more nuanced view..\n\nThis may have been true in past times, where something like a Super Bowl ad just \u201cwas\u201d $25 million and couldn\u2019t be directly linked to sales. It was a prayer, basically. An attempt at PR, hard to quantify.    \n     \nUser-specific targeting was kind of a game changer though. I\u2019m someone with very specific interests, as is the case with most people, and I\u2019ve seen ads on platforms like Instagram for companies that I would literally never have heard of otherwise. I rarely purchase such products even though they\u2019re interesting, but in some cases I do end up pulling the trigger. Like \u201chey, I need some bath soap, and this looks super cool and is locally sourced!\u201d Small businesses and startups now have tools available to ramp up product awareness across the globe for exactly the type of people who might be interested. In the past, they would have needed to rely on word of mouth or prohibitively expensive as campaigns to get the same yield. \n\nWeb ads also mean that you can gather a ton of data on how different ad spend translates into sales. There are entire teams of people who do nothing but optimize targeting, and their work is based on data. As in, they\u2019re optimizing real numbers in a way that wasn\u2019t possible decades ago. And it\u2019s hard to argue with data.",

The difference comes down to what is considered a learned vs. unlearned behavior, not necessarily the body parts themselves. \n\nPutting aside the specific example here (the ad example), a Pavlovian response/conditioning would involve an unlearned response being paired with a previously neutral stimulus.  So the common example is the dog salivating over the food, right? The dog didn\u2019t need to be taught to salivate, but it did need to be \u201cpaired\u201d with the food (previously neutral stimulus) in order to then induce the salivating later on.\n\nIn terms of what youre referring to, some aspects of what you\u2019re talking about are biological, but not all.  For example, let\u2019s say you have a twitch that happens in (on?) your fingers every 30 seconds or so.  That would be an unlearned behavior that just happens.  In theory, you could pair that with a sound (previously neutral stimulus) and possibly induce that twitch later on. But, the important reason that this is Pavlovian is bc that \u201ctwitch\u201d is NOT learned- it\u2019s a biological response.  It\u2019s the same reason why you may not be able to eat X food after throwing up immediately after eating it. It was a biological response to a previously neutral stimulus.\n\nSo the reason this ad example is not Pavlovian- it\u2019s less about the specific body parts and more about the behaviors and how they came about.  No one \u201cscrolls\u201d past ads from birth. \n\nHowever, I will say, you could thereotically pair that scrolling with a sound to trigger that behavior, if it was really that important to you. Lol \n\nHope that makes sense!\n\nEdit to add- if it\u2019s not Pavlovian, some may be wondering what it actually is.  It\u2019s operant conditioning.  And I think it would actually be negative reinforcement that would be maintaining this behavior (which is NOT punishment)- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning",

It was not just about salivating over food (which is absolutely a natural biological function), it was about pairing the biological response to a new, previously neutral, stimulus- ringing a bell. \n\nPavlov knew that dogs naturally salivate just before/while eating food. (This is a natural response to eating, as it helps dogs (and us) break down our food while chewing.) Pavlov started ringing a bell while feeding the dogs, which essentially paired those two stimuli together. \n\nEventually, over enough time pairing these two stimuli together, if Pavlov would ring the bell (without any food present) the dogs would begin salivating. This proved that a completely unrelated stimuli could trigger a biological response.\n\n*edit: if clicking on an ad in the past lead to malware/a virus, and then the user avoids that behaviour (clicking on ads) in the future, that is positive punishment.",

It is best practice to have as close to 100% share of voice on all branded searches at a minimum. For instance, \"nike basketball shoes\" is a branded search for Nike. The last thing they want is for a competitor to conquest their ads and everytime you search for \"Nike\" a Reebok ad shows up first. Even more important when your brand doesn't populate up top the SERPs. Imagine spending a ton of money on a TV ad campaign and when people go to search they can't even find your site. \n\nsource: I work in SEM and write the copy for these ads as part of my job.",

We would have to make sure that that link leads you right away to the 'red shoes' selection, and hopefully you'd see something you want. If you're searching for red shoes and we don't have any, and we show an irrelevant ad, then you'll click and then go away without buying anything - and it would've cost us 50p or so for that.

So many times I've seen \"the thing i want\" only for me to click on it and see they don't have any of that stuff, doesn't even come close (like looking for leather sofa's and clicking on the link sends me to a store that sells only lamps). \n\nHow do you see your job in 10 years? Cuz I don't know anyone who's not getting fed up with advertisements (online through social media, search engines, TV ads or even billboards.) I see people around me increasingly becoming aware of and using things like duckduckgoo or simple adblock. If I had any kind of marketing job I'd be really worried about that, but how do you see this as a person with more experience in this field?",

Small businesses will sometimes work with a Google rep to help them place ads.\n\nRemarketing/Retargeting is a very effective tactic. When you made a purchase and showed intent, you were given a cookie and placed on a remarketing list. They have an expiration date though I don't know the maximum time off the top of my head. I think its 180 days although best practice is 60-90 days. It may not work on you and thats totally fine as we only get charged if you click on an ad. Although some display ads use a CPM model instead of CPC.\n\nWith big data only getting better and more granular, advertising will too. Think about all these free services you get to use like Google. They are able to remain \"free\" because you give them your data in exchange. Obviously there will be some forms of advertising that go by the wayside much like print ads have but advertising will always be around and as a digital marketer I have never been more confident in the future of my industry.  \n\nI use adblock myself and encourage people to use it as it is a very small portion of the target audience.",

Thought it seemed hella fishy and I finally noticed that the URL in the adress bar had a very subtle spelling error in it. The website itself had been made up to look lile an excact copy of the actual website I was trying to reach. Super shady. \n\nI reported the ad to Google and immediately changed my password. But yeah, I never click on these ads anymore. I\u2019m so paranoid now that if I accidentally click one, I\u2019ll go back and click the \u201creal\u201d link instead.",

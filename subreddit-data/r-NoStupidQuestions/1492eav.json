    "postText": "I noticed a lot of people trying to give away all sort of small to really large sheets of tempered glass, I have a crawlspace which I've been thinking on the possibility of encapsulating, so I have this question popped up in my mind.\nLikely a bad idea, as I have not come across anything about it, as i tried to search for it.\nCan't do wrong with asking, right?\nAt worse, I learn something; at best, I might build a innovating space, and recicle something that could be going in the dump.\n\nOne downside I can see is the potential of the glass shattering, so knowing what sheet thickness or some specific tempered glass to avoid, could eliminate this downside.\nSince the glass cannot be cut, likely be spots that would require other materials to be used to fill in. Since is a crawlspace though, that rarely anyone care about the aesthetics of it, I'm not concerned of the idea of having to do such.\n\nI'm not really too serious about attempting this; I'm more curious about if is feasible or not, and if it is, how would be done, if you were to attempt building one?\n\nSo this question could lead to a simple no, or something interesting.\nI'm hoping for the later.",

I'd look for something and could hardly find what I'm looking for, so I click on a video that's close but not exactly what I want, and then I find what I want in the related videos (with the keywords i searched!)\n\nThis only started happening recently, like maybe the recent weeks or months. I wonder if anyone else experienced this lately?",

I just fucking hate it. Just give me what I searched for!",

Then, one of them makes a reference to whatever is the current meme (a few weeks ago I could say the celebrating coffin, for example) so you decide to search for the name of this meme on the exact same tab you are without thinking about this trick, as soon as the video ends.\n\nWell, I hope you enjoy having your recommendations be meme compilations including 2012~2013 memes for a few weeks instead of the movies related stuff you enjoy because you didn't fucking think of opening a porn mode tab during that one search.",

So I go to their channel and find that under their \"videos\" tab all the uploads are in what appears to be a random order (I'm guessing it's by views, likes, or some combination), with no sort function. Why does it not just show their most recent ones first?",

I typed something related to bedding, so Google shopping insists I buy one of four thousand different king-sized duvets for $400. I'm sure more and more people using images for a functional shopping filter made the products seem more relevant, even without choosing the product filter.\n\nI'm sort of surprised any products make money from advertising on Google shopping considering how terribly it functions. But I only shop online when I need something too specific to find used/local in the time frame. Maybe there are a bunch of people who like to type in \"blue\" to Google shopping the way my grandmother would browse 6 months of my mom's catalogues whenever she'd visit.",

For example, you're looking for a specific shoe, and instead the top results will just give you the shoe section of well known stores even though they don't carry that specific shoe which is all you're interested in.",

It turns out the big online flower websites just partner with these small local shops to fulfill orders. So the $20+ shipping and handling fee is utter bullshit because odds are that flower arrangement travels &lt; 5 miles from store to door. I discovered this by searching around the area and found that a lot of the small local shops had websites with the exact same format and their products were all exactly the same as the big online stores. I think it's a similar arrangement to what grubhub has with restaurants where they jack up the prices and fees for providing an online portal to order from small shops that don't have the capability to create their own website with online ordering. \n\n\nSo I'd recommend calling the local stores directly. Sometimes you can get a much better price by cutting out the corporate middleman.\n\n\nAnd to your main point -  SEO and Google's inability or indifference to combat it sucks. I'll search a specific phrase or word in quotation marks and get results back that don't contain that phrase anywhere AT ALL. I'll click through to webpage, do a Ctrl+F to search the page and it's not there. I assume the phrase appears 1000 times in hidden code or something because I don't know how else it would appear at the top.",

            "comment": "Google is absolute garbage for searching anything related to a product. If I'm trying to learn something invariably I am required to search another source like Reddit through Google. \n\nFor example, I became introduced to the concept of weighted blankets and was intrigued. So I Google \"why use a weighted blanket\" and \"weighted blanket benefits\". Just by virtue of the word \"weighted blanket\" being in the search I got pages and pages of nothing but ads trying to sell them, and zero meaningful discourse on why I would use one. So then I have to resort to limiting myself by searching \"site:www.reddit.com weighted blanket benefits\" just so I can get connected to real people talking about the device and its benefits/drawbacks. \n\nAnyway, fuck Google. It's still okay for searching about concepts, but if you try to search anything even remotely commercial or that can be sold as a product then good fucking luck. Unfortunately the alternatives aren't much better because engines like Duckduckgo just simply aren't as good at indexing and giving you the results you would want.\n\n2000's Google was the best in my memory.",

Even the history search doesn't return things ver batim. The URL bar also searches history and doesn't return half the sites I've visited, only the things it *thinks* I want. This means that unlike in the past, if I know I visited a site, half the time the only way to get the URL is to manually scroll through my history.\n\nI'm assuming this is to cater to people who have no idea how to use a search engine, browser, etc, but for those of us that got used to crafting explicit queries, it's really fucked us over.\n\nIt's the same shit MS has done with Windows. The windows search became shit because it started trying to guess what you want instead of just returning what you type in. \n\nIt's the stupification of consumer electronics.",

            "comment": "Like others have said, it's not just in your head and it is unfortunately 100% intentional. It's true that Google spams ads in Search and any site that uses Google Ad Services with hidden trackers (about 76% of the internet as reported by CNBC), but the more sinister thing to consider is WHY do they do this? I put a TL;DR but it's very worth it to check out all the links I tagged in this.\n\nTL;DR - It's not about money. Everything Google presents you is a social experiment to see how you will interact with what they put in front of you. Google intentionally inconveniences you as part of the experiment. All of that data is collected, attributed to the personal profile they have of you and used educate their machine learning and artificial intelligences, just like in the movie Ex Machina. Google will probably be first to create sentient AI. Here's their progress from 2 years ago so they of course are farther along now. [Google's AI Assistant Can Now Make Real Phone Calls](https://youtu.be/JvbHu_bVa_g) \n\nThe Daily Mail and Forbes report Alphabet (Google's parent company founded by Google executives) is valued at over 1 trillion dollars. Google is by no means struggling financially and does not NEED to spam the whole internet with ads so then why do they do it? There are many reasons and none of them as simple as greed. I have a friend who used to work at Google X (Google's own Area 51 branch) and he's confirmed to me many times how Google is the most brilliant, nefarious company on earth. \n\nIt's not about money. Everything Google presents you is a social experiment to see how you will interact with what they put in front of you. Google (and Facebook and Amazon) track how you INTERACT with a page's information ([Google and Facebook are watching our everyone move online.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/google-facebook-data-privacy-concerns-out-of-control-commentary.html) ). \nThis means how long you hover over an item with the mouse, how long you keep your screen positioned on certain objects, what you do and don't click on, how long you stay on a certain link or page, how have you interacted with similar links/objects in the past and much more. They have a system in place that measures where they think your eyes are focused when looking at the screen. Google intentionally inconveniences you as part of the experiment in order to see how you will react (Facebook got in trouble for the same things years ago but everybody does it now [Facebook's secret psychological experiment on users.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/facebook-sorry-secret-psychological-experiment-users) ). All of this data is collected, attributed to the hugely intricate personal profile they have of you and used educate their machine learning and artificial intelligences, just like in the movie Ex Machina. In that movie, the genius founder of a tech company similar to Google funnels all the information from the world's search history into an AI to potentially create sentience. Google's legitimately doing the same thing. I am not a conspiracy theorist and I mean this in the most literal, non-sensationalist way but Google genuinely wants world domination thorough tech. Not money, not simply power or influence, but the ability to manipulate the minds and lives of the masses however they please. It's the closest power trip to being a god. The more you read insightful tech news with insider knowledge, the more you come to see this is true.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to say, if you really care about your privacy, which we all should, then you should use Firefox as your default browser with AdBlockPlus and DuckDuckGo.com as your search engine. These are the only major players who don't track you and sell your data. Also check your privacy settings on all social media because you have more options than you realize, and finally, you can turn off the extreme default personalization of Google Ad Services if you want. You'll start getting lots of weird random ads but they won't be based on invasive info collected on you.

I really care about people understanding their control over their own data and what's really going on behind the scenes with these tech giants.",

And if you search for something like \"big bananas linked to blah blah blah because blah blah blah\" instead of getting specific query you will still get \"why bananas are healthy\" and nowhere will you get a single article even trying to answer the thing you're looking for.\n\nPopularity of the article and of the website itself seems to be weighted far more important than answering the actual querry.\n\n\nduckduckgo is just as useless\n\nbing.com can sometimes be better actually, but nowhere near Google's former levels of fame.\n\nI think this might be a result of search engine optimization too.",

And in the middle, there will be a period where people can\u2019t agree of it even has a blowhole, or even what constitutes a blowhole. Does an alligator have a blowhole?  It wouldn\u2019t be a whale either. But again, same problem, what\u2019s a whale?\n\nBut it\u2019s be slow gradual changes. The blowhole doesn\u2019t form and one day whales breathe through it, the nostril location changes slowly over time. That\u2019s why I asked about alligators. The nostrils are on the top of the snout and they lay in the water with only the top of their body exposed. They\u2019ll also go under water and come up to breathe. So, blowhole?  That\u2019s what the nostrils on some whale predecessors may have been like.",

So in that order there will always survive the rats that have the best mutations to live in water (biggest lungs, best under-water orientation, best limbs for water, etc.).   \nNow imagine them over the time of millions of years becoming otter-like things, then seal-like things, then dolphin-like things, and then whales. I would imagine that being a plausible case.",

            "comment": "Evolution works because something with a good mutation survived and passed that mutation to its offspring. None of it was some fast magical change. It happen slowly. Cell by cell, millimeter by millimeter. \n\nMillions of years ago an ancestor of the whale lived on land and had fur, four legs, a tale like most modern mammals and a snout with a nose. Some members of that ancestor species started spending more time in the water. And then more and more. It started losing its fur. Its paws became webbed. By now it was spending almost all of its time in the water. \n\nThis evolution continued. It\u2019s tail became more muscular, maybe to just help it change direction better at first or maybe it started using it to propel itself faster right away. Soon it\u2019s back legs were just sitting there not being used so they got smaller and smaller. \n\nMeanwhile it took extra energy to lift its nose out of the water. At some point a genetic mutation made the nostrils slightly turn up making it slightly easier to breath. That creature was able to spend a split second less breathing meaning it could use that split second to do other things. Th nose continued to turn up but it still had to lift its head. Off spring continues to develop and the ones that did best had their nose move from the front of their snout, to the top and then along the head and eventually to the back. \n\nIt isn\u2019t about big changes. It\u2019s about little ones. At some point in history two members of a human ancestor species were somewhere together. Suddenly they realized there was a predator and they ran. One was ever so slightly faster than the other whether due to metabolism, bone structure, musculature or some other slight difference. The one that ran faster survived because the other one was caught by the predator. So that ancestor passed those same genes on to its offspring making us slightly faster than we were.",

Those that were able to last longer in the water were able to feed on fish wouldn\u2019t need to compete for prey, flee larger predators, or hunt prey who had evolved to avoid land predators. So, across hundreds of generations, a whale\u2019s ancestors may have gotten better and better at holding their breath and better and better at swimming, potentially developing webbed toes and then fins, until eventually you have a mammal suited for water. If anything, a mammal living in water makes more sense if you assume a land mammal moved to water and evolved than if God just decided to fuck around and make 3 fish need air",

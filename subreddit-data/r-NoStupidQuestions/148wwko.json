    "postText": "Hi there!\n\n34F here with a family hx of diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. In short, if I don\u2019t exercise at least 2 to 3 days a week, I put weight on very easily. I aim to work out at least 30 mins a day 4 to 5 days a week and have for the last 15 years for weight management. I\u2019m not athletic and never played sports as a kid. Also, I love food (mostly healthy due to a sensitive stomach but I can throw down if necessary). I love exercise when I do it but when I\u2019ve fallen off the wagon it can be hard to get back on but I KNOW it\u2019s good for me so I eventually find my way back. Knowing how good exercise is for physical and mental health, why are there people who refuse to be even a little active? This isn\u2019t meant to be judgmental at all, I\u2019m genuinely curious.",

It was painful. \n\nI lost 115 lbs. it\u2019s astonishing how much easier and enjoyable exercise was. \n\nIf overweight people could feel just how easy it is to exercise/move around at a healthy weight, we\u2019d have a lot less overweight people.",

When I was running daily (30 minutes) I always felt like I was about to give up during the run. \n\nMy theory is that because I'm not muscular (bottom 7% of lean body weight for the same height) my muscles just aren't particularly strong and that's why I am stressed exercising, which is why I don't enjoy exercise.\n\nBTW I hate exercise even when slim.",

This is also easier than saying \"no\"\n\nYou will learn through time how to ask someone out smoothly and work it into a conversation.  But for now, as a newbie to the process, just asking it at someone point during a conversation is what you will aim to do.  You will get better at it.  \n\nJust know that you will be rejected sometimes.  You will be accepted for a date sometime.  \n\nOnce you get someone you are interested in accepting a date, then come back here and we can take you to the next steps or you can also to go to r/DatingAdvice",

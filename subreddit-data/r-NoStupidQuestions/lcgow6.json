My first job at a gas station didn't make me feel any better because I was treated like garbage, then I was a busser at a sports bar/alehouse place which had the same problem (except the one manager who was awesome to me, fuck yeah he was great.) Then I landed a job as a plumbers apprentice, and it really has reinvigorated my love for living. Tldr I have disliked living for most of my (short) life but being able to do something as important as fixing people's plumbing or repairing their BFPs has been a great experience. I feel like I have a reason to live since I'm enjoying this job and am doing something that helps people directly, as lame as it may sound. Also my family has been a big help the whole way helping me stay sane :)",

And the people who have are not gonna let the people who don\u2019t have just get basic income without working. Because our entire thing is you have to earn your keep. So they\u2019re gonna have to come with more creative ways to keep people occupied even though there won\u2019t be many real job because the computers will be doing them all. A futurologist from decades ago, I think it was Alvin  toffler, or was it an economist from a century ago I can\u2019t remember and I\u2019m too lazy to look up, had predicted that with automation people would work less not more.

When my son was a baby, so almost 6 years ago, i sat down and added up all the monthly expenses of having a formula-fed newborn. It was roughly $600/mo, but that *did* include diapers, wipes, formula, etc. \n\nThankfully in Canada we have the child tax benefit, which, depending on income, can be up to around $580/mo, per child. Once they hit a certain age, i think 12 or 13, that amount drops, and then eventually stops all together. But man oh man does it ever help, really. Especially once they hit school age and the school wants money from you every time you turn around lol. \n\nIs there such a thing in the US? Ive never heard about it one way or another.\n\nBut having that much help every month makes a huge difference, and honestly i think it gives people that extra hope at having kids. Theres a lot of comments like yours, that financial issues can seem to take that desire away, and honestly its heartbreaking. I think anyone that wants to have children should be able to do so without *all of it* being decided by finances, you know? I mean, im not saying every child requires $600/mo to raise them, that was just my estimate with my son *at that time*. It could be much more or less depending on your situation too.",

I was constantly asked to cover someone's shift who wouldn't/couldn't/didn't want to show up. I suggested people to hire, friends who were actively looking for jobs. Management wouldn't hire them.\n\nWithin 2 months of starting I had the highest in counter sales and the highest in kpi  sales for a non management role, but even higher than all the managers besides the commercial manager/inside sales and the store manager.\n\nI loved what I was doing and I was working circles around everyone at our store.\n\nWhen my 45 day review came around I was told I was just doing an average job, I was doing just enough to keep me employed.\n\nI realized that the guy to my left was probably making 14 an hour after being there for 7 years and the guy who couldn't show up who had been there for 20 years was probably making 16 dollars an hour only because he never quit and kept getting 40 cent raises every year.\n\nId rather check out than work 60+ hours a week for just enough money to eat and share a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 other people...\n\nIts just enough money to allow you to show up at work week after week and have no time or enough cash to do anything except show up.\n\n\\#3 in sales within 45 days in a 20 person retail shop working 60+ hours a week and being told I'm just average by management so they can boost their bonus. Nah ill take a pass and work on my resume.\n\nEdit: words/clarity",

I was an adult when they divorced, but she didn't tell me how bad her money situation was to protect me. I found out a few years later how much she'd been struggling when I was staying at her house for a few days and woke up at like 2am to get some water and found her crying in her loungeroom because her power and water were way overdue and the credit cards were going up instead of down due to interest and she didn't know how she was going to pay them.\n\nFirst thing I did was pay off all mum's current bills, then we got a lawyer and dumped all of dad's credit cards back on him. My mum now lives with my husband and I, she doesn't want for anything, she's been able to retire (she was filling the freezer section at a supermarket in her 60s) and she's been able to finally do the things she's always wanted to do.\n\nMy husband and I are able to support my mum while saving and affording things we like to do. I generally enjoy my job and co-workers, but if I didn't have to work I'd totally quit and play video games and do my hobbies all day. I probably could if it was just my husband and I, but I never want my mum to worry about money again and I want to give her the life she deserves after she did that for me to her own detriment for 30 years and so I roll my arse out of bed and keep working.",

Every time I would get banged up or feel a pull or twist or pop a part of me is like \u201cman I hope something is fucked up so I can take some time off work\u201d but it never happened. I did have an MCL injury that I literally didn\u2019t miss any work for. If it was something a little more serious I figured I\u2019d rehab the injury and get back out there.\n\nFucked up part is I tore my meniscus playing last year and only got 2 days off (surgery was a Thursday) and now my leg is not the same a year later and I can\u2019t play hockey anymore. Part of me thinks this is some weird form of punishment for wishing injury on myself. I miss hockey so much and work gets worse every day. Life can be really cruel sometimes.",

Regular jobs don't cut it for independant survival any more, never mind saving any money. Cost of living is so high that dual-income parents can't support their kids. Property is nearly inaccessible to anyone born in the last thirty years. \n\nAnd in response to this we're constantly told to just try harder. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps, get a side hustle.

I buy Magic cards I really want to build the best decks I can. I buy rare collectibles to add to my collection. I buy hard to find anime that I've always wanted. I buy video games or old consoles and stuff like that. \n\nMy job is merely a means to an end and since I started looking at it that way, it's greatly improved my mood. I just leased a 2000 Blazer that I'm taking on extra work to get paid off as quickly as possible so I can start building it into a badass 4X4 trail rider. \n\nIt doesn't work for everyone, but if there are things you like doing then focus on those to get you through the day.

            "comment": "I love this post. I\u2019m depressed and have been for years and have wondered the same thing. If you don\u2019t make a certain income and/or are living paycheck-to-paycheck and you\u2019re not passionate about your work, I really don\u2019t understand how people do that for years on end. I\u2019m only 25 and I was fed up with working years ago to the point that I even became suicidal. Maybe I have a sense of entitlement having grown up with many things given to me admittedly, but even if that hadn\u2019t been the case I\u2019m pretty sure I would still feel similar, maybe further down the road. I don\u2019t know how people go for 40 years spending 1/3 of their lives doing something they hate. Many people respond to that with reasons such as having kids or family members to take care of, and while I respect that, it still sounds depressing to have to sign away a third of your life just to make ends meet for yourself and a few other people.\n\nNot to change the subject but I really feel as though the current wealth gap at least in the U.S. is a main contributor to why so many people have to live this way. It\u2019s unfortunate. I\u2019m not hating on people that have become successful, but more than 50% of all wealth is in the hands of 1% of the people. This is what creates the unhealthy work-life balance that many people experience while people like Jeff Bezos and Oprah have multiple homes which are unoccupied for most of the year. Spaces which could very well be inhabited by people that would be more than happy to live there full-time.\n\nUltimately time is money. Everybody knows that. So following that logic, if there is someone such as Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates that could never work another day in their life and still be more than comfortable, that means that proportionately, logically, and inevitably, there are going to be numerous people that will never get to experience what it\u2019s like to have more than 8 hours of down time per day (really 5-6 or even less if you count commuting and taking care of other responsibilities).",

Maybe I\u2019m alone with this opinion but it\u2019s worth a shot, especially if you\u2019re at the point where you are questioning whether you should even be alive. A carpenter or house builder always seemed like they would be satisfying careers, as well. Just my two cents",

The resto of the time was spent with their families and friends: their tribe, the people that they loved. Sure, they had plenty of other stressors, including a shorter lifespan, high infant mortality, deadly disease and animals, etc., but they were external stressors that the mind had millions of years to evolve to deal with. HGs weren't worried about money or politics.\n\nOur HG brains are not equipped to deal with 50 hour work plus all the other shit in life. u/poop_wagon, you are not alone, and feeling like this is completely normal.\n\nMy best advice is to take up meditation, because the structure of society is not gonna change any time soon. \"We can't control what happens to us in life, but we can control the way we experience it.\"  \n\n\n*Edited for grammar*",

Unless you omit for the sake of privacy aspects of your life (which would be perfectly legit), it sounds like main part of your day is the job. My motivation improved when I got a cat (or you can get any other pet, I just like cats) and I knew I'm getting up to play and give food before going to work. Going home from work I would not be drenched in cloud of \"this job sucks\". I would be automatically caught in \"is the cat waiting on the window, or just sleeping\" and these small little things help to improve jo psychological hygiene. Getting some hobbies that are far from work and if possible active (sitting home with Netflix or games leads often to idle thoughts) helps as well.\n\nSo I get out because of cat(s) and airsoft. Try to find something to cheer you and keep you going as well.",

Currently I'm going down a career path that doesn't necessarily appeal to me, but it is something im good at, and it's something that will enable me to do more fun things with/in my life and remove many worries brought on by daily life. The kid in me would say to keep searching until you find your dream job, but at some point, and in some situations, that's just not the best way to go about your life. If you're focusing on your job, then perhaps it's taking up to much of your consciousness. Do what you love, and when you can't, work towards it.",

The whole thing about worker alienation Marx talked about is real and in our time it's getting worse. Capitalism, whether you are for or against it, does have this effect on the working class, and all of us who aren't owners are workers plain and simple. The idea of a middle class , while a handy descriptor for some discussion of social values, is really just a way to keep the working class divided and our attention away from the owners who run society.\n\nAs workers, everything we do belongs to somebody else. Our creativity, our dedication, our altruistic intentions, all of it belongs to the owner class.  It's no wonder we feel lost and alone.",

Are you a creative type per chance?\n\nCreatives tend to be \u201cfree spirits\u201d and feel confined and stunted in any work they do regardless of if they like or are good at it.\n\nDo you particularly have ADHD as well? That\u2019s also a typical feeling ADHD people have (speaking as a person with ADHD who\u2019s also studied psychology).\n\nHave you considered/looked into becoming self employed in some way? If it\u2019s not financially feasible to be self employed, a temporary solution is to work a job that pays the bills but also allows you enough time to work towards being self employed. \u201cA job to pay for your hobby\u201d if you will. A small example is how my mother in law works a technical job but couldn\u2019t care less about computers to supplement her ceramics shop and her horses that she loves. She works 12 hour days but only for 3 days and has 4 days to herself to do what she enjoys. She only has a high school diploma as far as I know so degrees aren\u2019t even necessarily that integral (not useless, I have a degree and proud of it, but it\u2019s not always necessary).\n\nI hope you can find your passion. If you\u2019re under 30, this is quite normal to feel. We go through a few life crises throughout our lives and I learned in one of my psychology classes that the average adult will change careers at least 7 times in their entire lifespan. \n\nIt\u2019s annoying and frustrating but don\u2019t give up! Just keep trying to find yourself and worst case scenario, there\u2019s always retirement to look forward to.\n\nSending you positive energy on your journey!",

Work is just something, one of the things, that I do. It's not who I am, or all that I do. I enjoy going out and helping people, so when I walk to work, that's an opportunity for me to find chances I can help people. Even if it's something as simple as picking up an extra apple and giving it to someone else.\n\nThat helps I think. Finding what does make you happy and just doing that. I feel rewarded from helping others and experiencing new things. Work just gives me money to do that.",

I have been absolutely miserable at every single job I've worked at. It felt purposeless doing a job I didn't give a shit about. Plus, if you add a dickhead abusive manager who treats you like shit into the equation and he will make going to work everyday absolutely miserable. It's the equivalent of waking up every morning and driving directly to you're bully's house just to hangout for 8 hours straight.\n\nAfter bouncing around from job to job I began feeling helpless and like something was wrong with me. I've walked out of multiple jobs due to the fact that I was so miserable going into work everyday and doing something I wasn't passionate about. That's when I decided enough was enough and started on my path to get an education. I'm now studying computer animation and I am happy to say I am chasing my dreams and will one day be working in a job field I am truly passionate about.  In the meantime I found a job that actually works for me and I'm not actually miserable at. I get to work alone (no boss, no manager, no coworkers) and listen to interesting podcasts all day. I feel like I have more control over my day and my decisions and I'm trusted to do my job while no one is watching. It's the perfect job for me to be doing while I'm getting my education.

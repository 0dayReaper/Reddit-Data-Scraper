    "postText": "Me and my roommate have been depressed and so have had the bad habit of smoking bongs inside for the last few months. I happen to have an already bad sense of smell, plus I\u2019m used to the smell itself, so I\u2019m not sure how bad it is but probably quite bad. We\u2019ve got a fabric couch and a rug as well.\n\nSo far I\u2019m thinking:\n\n- airing the place as much as possible especially with airflow from the back to the front\n- will try and get my hands on an air purifier (might be too expensive at the moment)\n- washing couch cushions \n- maybe getting the rug and couch itself steam cleaned \n- general clean of the house/vacuum for any debris \n\nAny other tips?",

It'll react with just about everything and anything to make a whole host of toxic byproducts. Ozone levels are an indicator of air quality (high ozone means bad air quality!) It's also very very very toxic (hence why you cannot be next to an open ozone generator). \n\nHonestly I'm not even that concerned about ozone itself. Ozone g\u00e9n\u00e9ration needs quite a bit of power and I'm more than certain ozone generators on the market don't meet safety qualifications. So it's an big fire risk and you're not going to be around. Plus you're a stoner and as an ex stoner I know we like to be comfortable. So lots of wooly surfaces and an unsupervised sketchy high power ozone generator is asking for a fire.",

A single bottle of Ozium will obliterate any smell if you use it enough- the directions say to only spray for 1 second for an entire room. Do that a couple times a day for a few weeks and the room will smell antiseptic.",

Its called olfactory fatigue, when aroused by an odorant the olfactory neurons in our brain start to stabilize through a feedback loop, and over time the smell of the odorant gets weaker and weaker until you can no longer notice it.\n\nMore often than not people notice the bad smell of a car or room when they first enter them. Along with weed smokers not being able to smell weed, it happens to people with body odor/bad breath, and it happens to cigarette smokers. Be a good friend and let others know when they STINK, they may not be able to tell.\n\nBut yeah, enough with my long-winded explanation, I completely agree with getting a non-smoker to come over and judge it.",

I use lavender soap. \n\nIf you're going to keep smoking inside look into concentrates. A lot of the time they're comparable in price to bud these days at dispensaries and will be a lot less pungent overall",

In 12 hours your place can smell just fine. Do some laundry. Mop floors. Chuck an air freshener down. Use your dryer with your clean laundry if you have one. Put some carpet cleaning foam down on the carpet. It will be fine.\n\nSee some people saying clean the walls and shit but thats unnecessary I think and is a tough job.

I'm talking at LEAST 2-3 sticks burning in each room, all windows and doors closed so the fragrant smoke doesn't blow away but settles into every little crack of every weed-smokey surface. Be mindful to light them well away from anything remotely like a fire hazard, these babies can drop the glowing end or fall over.\n\nThe trick is it's a similar chemical composition to the bad odour and spreads in the same way; good smoke covering bad smoke. It'll be overwhelming at first but your house will smell good for days.",

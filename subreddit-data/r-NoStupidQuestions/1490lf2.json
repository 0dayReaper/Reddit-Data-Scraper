    "postText": "I (F22) just got out of a very much tiring relationship of 2 and a half years. There's this cute guy (M24) I go to university with, and has been someone I've known passing. A week ago, I  hung out with him, and he offered if I wanted to be friends with benefits with him.\n\nSo we were hanging out somewhere, (I asked if he had wanted to hang out, as the night before he called me and asked if I wanted to go on a drive with him. The following day, I asked if he wanted to hang out and he agreed. We kinda knew each other from similar friend groups.) And we got into talking about things. I tried my hardest to not bring up anything sexual, although he was a very attractive person. However, we got into talking about it as he initiated. He told me we should hang out more, and then we got into the actual fwb conversation. He said he wanted something purely physical and non-committal. \n\nI understood, and told him that at the time, I chose to say no, as still was coping with the recent breakup with my ex. EDIT: He told me it hurt his ego a bit (as a joke)that I turned him down. Anyway, fast forward, he drove me home and told me that he was still keen on his offer. I \"thanked\" him sarcastically, and told him I'd hit him up if I ever changed my mind. \n\nThat being said, it's been a week. To be honest, I've been thinking about it a lot, and want to maybe do it. But I don't know if things have fizzled out. We haven't talked ever since. What do I do? \n\n\nTLDR: There's this cute guy (M24) I (F22) go to university with, and has been someone I've known passing. A week ago, we were hanging out, and he offered if I wanted to be friends with benefits with him. What do I do?",

Nobody but you knows whether or not you're jumping into things too quickly or not.\n\nBut I probably would at least take things slow and see if he respects your boundaries or if he just pushes to sex.  \n\nI'm not saying he'd hold you down or anything but a lot of dudes whine or just keep trying to wear you down until they hear ok and that's fine to them.  And it's not ok\n\nBut it's not my life at the end of the day, just my two cents",

You said you found him attractive, you don't have to restrict yourself because of a past relationship\".\n\nHowever, the \"He told me it hurt his ego\" part ... yikes. That's worrying. And asking again a few hours later on top of it is also pretty bad. Seems like a guy who isn't very good at taking no for an answer. Fwb are tricky relations, they are notorious for not ending up well. I'm not sure you want to risk it with a guy having this kind of mentality.",

If you think the ego joke wasn't light-hearted or that he is disrespectful then I'll agree on not committing to anything with him \n\nBut if you think the dude is respectful/cool then honestly I'd say go for it if you trust him, at least as a one time thing. Fwb don't really work imo but for someone out of a two year relationship, having a rebound helps get you back into the dating scene or at least out of the relationship mindset.\n\nBiggest stipulation here is how comfortable/trusting you are of the dude and whether or not you want to. If things don't work out, then I'm sure by now you understand that shit happens and some people suck. But I'd rather try out something I think 'would be cool' then miss an opportunity.\n\nAlso 'though i just got out of a relationship?' - relationships kinda end for a reason. If you weren't ready for it to end/ready to move on, then sure maybe hold off and digest it before you go back into the scene, but no one can say when you will/won't be ready to move past a relationship but you.",

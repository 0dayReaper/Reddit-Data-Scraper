We can go anywhere deemed \"necessary,\" such as work, grocery, pharmacy, doctor, etc.  I plan to go out on my boat and I seriously doubt anyone will try to stop me because my boat is already kept in the water (boat ramps/access are closed) and I'll be alone.",

Up until now only Denver was doing anything.\n\nEven then, the exceptions are so many and so vaguely defined that it's almost pointless. Other than restaurants and bars being closed, people are basically going along with their normal lives.\n\nMy personal thought is the only way the US has a chance at preventing this is with heavy fines and a lot of people enforcing them.\n\nIt's so immensely frustrating I can't stand it.",

Then the pleasure of getting to come inside from the wet cold, strip everything off, take a hot shower, and put on cozy sweats is amazing!! You have to shift the way you look at it. (And maybe invest in some good waterproof clothes to keep you warm and dry.)",

I feel truly alive again when I get to soak up some sun after a long stretch without it; I feel like a snake on a rock getting some rays. Sometimes I stop walking and just stand, turned towards the sun like a plant. \n\nIt\u2019s so interesting how it\u2019s changed for me!",

Perhaps If it's not out of pain and forcing your shit out, you may be having butt hunger... similar experience here is about the time that I had to work 24/7 and things were not that okay in my life, I had a house, I had a car, I had a job and savings, I just didn't have time to enjoy my life or choosing a partner or anything, I was way more busier working to know that I'm lonely or not. after a while different parts of my body started to hurt and i couldn't stop the pain and dropped unwanted tears while nightdrives as well, I was diagnoised with \"skin hunger\"; I didn't even know it's a thing. I needed hugs and intimacy. Different organs of your body could get hungry or thirsty. But you need to make sure before taking actions",

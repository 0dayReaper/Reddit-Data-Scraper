Some 'tech support' scammers put up ads on common Google searches, and they are the scum of the earth, so I'd love to screw them over. I'm sure there are enough safeguards in place though that they wouldn't really lose out (not least, I'm sure they have a maximum amount they'll pay per day/month before pulling the ad).",

For instance, a small business bidding on their company name will be relatively cheap (if its unique) where as an industry term may be much much more per click. \n\nFor instance the company I work for is only a few dollars for the company name, but one of our key terms for leads goes from $16-$24 a click. Hundreds of dollars a day just to get those sweet sweet inquiries. That\u2019s one of the reasons sales can be so competitive and bonus driven, without converting those leads the company in question is just throwing money at the wall. Fine for the mega corps but deadly for small businesses. \n\nThis only applies to the terms which are clearly labeled as adds. The organic search results after that are based on completely different criteria. ",

                    "comment": "You buy ads in Google search based on keywords, and then you select how much you'd be willing to pay for each click on your ad. This is your bid. Whoever bids the most takes top spot (roughly - there are some other factors Google takes into account, like whether your site is a bit spammy or loads really slowly).\n\nIf you Google \"buy hammock\", Amazon is the first \"organic\" (non-paid) result, but Amazon isn't the first paid result. This means they'll lose some of that sweet, sweet hammock traffic to competitors, despite all the work they've put into topping the organic results. \n\nIn most industries, this goes one step further: companies buy ads for their own brand names. If you Google \"Amazon\" the top result is being paid for...by Amazon. There are two reasons they would do this. \n\nFirst, if they don't bid on the keyword \"Amazon\", a competitor will, and Amazon could lose traffic for searches for their particular brand to a competitor. Even if it's only a small amount of traffic, no business wants to be doing that. \n\nIt's not a huge loss for them to buy that ad space, either. Most businesses, knowing that Amazon will bid on their brand keyword, will know they have no chance of competing for that term, so they won't bother. This lowers the competition, which makes the keyword cheaper. So really Amazon just needs to be there, bidding something, just to stave off competitors trying to skim off little bits of traffic that's sort of 'rightfully theirs'.\n\nSecondly, when you make your ad for Google search, you get a lot more control of it than you do over your website's organic listing. You can choose exactly what text is displayed and choose with specific webpages are linked to. (you can do this to an extent for your organic listings using structured data, but ultimately it's up to the search engine what users see in your organic listings.)\n\nThe paid search listing for Amazon (at least, the one I see) includes links to Alexa, and a link to 'start your free Amazon prime trial'. By using a paid ad, Amazon can direct me to the specific parts of the site that are the most profitable and strategically important for the business. \n\nSimilarly, you can also target very specific audiences with paid listings, but you can't control these in organic. If your analytics data has shown you that people tend to start their Amazon trials in the evening, usually around 7pm, you can increase your bid at that time. \n\nOr you can create different ads for different audiences. If young people buy jelly beans rather than hammocks (the fools), you can create an ad for jelly beans and increase your bid for the ad space when someone under 35 is searching for jelly beans. Then you create a second ad about hammocks and increase your bid when someone over 45 is looking at it. \n\nIn short, the second reason Amazon and Apple might want to have paid ads despite performing so strongly is that paid ads give your more control over who sees your brand and what it is they see.\n\nFor most businesses, this second reason is a bit of a luxury. Showing paid ads just to direct your website users to a specific part of the site isn't really viable when you have a small budget, but for Amazon and Apple, who have silly super-powered paid marketing budgets, it's worth the investment.

E.g., in one study, participants wore headphones that played a different word in each ear. They were told to attend to one ear. They would reliably correctly report the word they heard in the ear they were attending to, and could not report what word was played in the other ear. The interesting bit is that after being played the words, they were shown an ambiguous sentence (e.g., \"she threw a stone at the bank\"). Their interpretation of the sentence correlated to which interpretation was related to the *unattended* word. So if the word they didn't attend to was \"money\" or something, they would interpret \"bank\" to mean 'financial institution,' even though they had no awareness of hearing the work \"money.\"\n\nAll that is just to say that you can be affected by things you don't pay attention to, but probably not to the extent that subliminal advertising works, like you said.",

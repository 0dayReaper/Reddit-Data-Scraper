    "postText": "(For outside) \nWith booze and a hoodie I\u2019ll be fine but asking because my girlfriend likes not having to overdress and enjoys sitting by a campfire while camping.\n\nEdit: since it\u2019s causing some confusion I\u2019d like to explain that the entire campground does not have restrictions on campfires and lights. The main part of the campground allows it but they have a Dark-Sky preserve zone further away from the regular campsite which has restrictions on artificial light pollution. People come here to see the stars and Aurora Borealis and the campsite promotes astronomy. Wether people show up with telescopes or photography equipment, if everyone around them were having campfires and making it less visible for them, I would be bothered by it too.\n\nThey do let you cook and use propane cookers but after sundown is when the rule comes in effect.\n\nEdit 2: I am sitting outside for hours in a chair, this is not for staying warm in the tent. Yes I know what a sleeping bag is. Yes I know I can wear warmer clothes. All I asked about were what other people use for a heater when camping",

For a cheap option go with double stainless heater that connects directly to the top of the tank. You just don't want to run those inside for a long period of time due to the gasses they emit. Both options will give a low orange glow that won't be very visible from a distance.",

After a few hours, wrap it up in fluffy towels like it was a Palantir. Fluff is important to comfort the rock, so they will relax.  Take the hot rock in its towel with you, along with a sleeping bag. \n\nWhen you get there, put your happy rock in the bag, put your feet in the bag, and you\u2019re all set. Don\u2019t let the rock touch the sleeping bag directly, as direct heat will melt the plastic in the fabrics. As Jedi Master Adams wrote, always bring a towel. \n\nYour rock will stay nice and warm for several hours.",

However, the automoderator thinks you're asking a question about the current events going on at Reddit regarding the API changes, the Global Blackouts, and why you might not be able to see your favorite subs any more. We like questions! But we've been getting so many questions about this topic that our users get tired of seeing them, so we've removed it. You may have a good question, like:\n\n* Why are so many subs suddenly private? Did it get removed by Reddit? What happens to posts there after the protest?\n\n* Can someone explain this whole Third Party App thing? What is Apollo? Why do some people prefer it to the official app?\n\n* Why isn't my favourite sub joining the protest? Can we force moderators to join?\n\n* Can't Reddit just force subreddits to stay open?\n\n* What are the best Reddit alternatives? Can't someone just copy the Reddit code and make a new version of Reddit that allows third party apps?\n\n* What should I do with my time during the blackout? \n\n[We've created a megathread where you can post questions like these - and more!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/143k833/reddit_api_changes_and_sitewide_protestsblackouts/) Check it out - questions posted there get answered regularly, and your question might already be answered there! If not, **feel free to post questions there** as long as you follow the rules.\n\nThis is an automated message. If you think your question has nothing to do with third party apps or the Reddit blackout, feel free to message the mods. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I put them in care packages to give to people without homes.  I know you can buy a bulk pack of glove or shoe sized versions from Amazon for a decent price and they last 8-12 hours.  The kind that are designed to heat your back or neck for therapeutic purposes can stay warm for 12-18 hours and are designed to wrap around and connect with Velcro and slightly elastic \"arms.\"  I know a woman who used these for menstrual cramps and muscle spasms/injury.  Both of these designs (\"packets\" and \"wraps\" use activated charcoal as a heating element.  It just needs to be exposed to air to begin warning up and the dust slowly turns into a solid mass over hours as it takes heat.  Just don't get them wet.",

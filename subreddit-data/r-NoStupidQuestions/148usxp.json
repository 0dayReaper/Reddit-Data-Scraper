    "postText": "\n\n\n\nI 17m went on a double date with a 17f and 2 other friends. The date went awesome. We had so much fun all of us. But at the end of the night she was driving me home and I was in the back of the car when she dropped me off because her friend was sitting in the front so I wasn\u2019t really able to do anything other then say bye. And the worst part is the other friend that was on the date with kept telling me that I needed to make a move by the end of the night either by hugging, kissing, holding hands. Anything, and I did none of that. I could tell she was kind of expecting it too because she kept whispering to my date that I might do something. So how badly did I screw up? First date btw. Do you think she lost attraction?",

At the right place at the right time, when it seems ok, get close to her and tell her you really want to kiss her. Then lean in, touch her very gently, see if she responds. If no, well, you tried. If yes, enjoy! Don't think any deeper than that. It's all probably fine.",

They don't use the special secret sauce paints that absorb radar nor are they designed to purposely deflect radar beams in other directions. A big old balloon still has an actually pretty sizeable area that would be considered \"flat enough.\"",

I wasn't sure if some of the microwaves fired at it might pass through as well.   \nBut, I figured I might have it wrong, which is why this question is in this subreddit lol",

Even reflecting back just some is usually enough.\n\nBut the missile used was a AIM-9X Sidewinder which uses infrared and is special in having a helmet-mounted targeting system. You just look at it, mark your target, and fire. The balloon was probably standing out on infrared due to being high up and getting hit by constant sunlight.",

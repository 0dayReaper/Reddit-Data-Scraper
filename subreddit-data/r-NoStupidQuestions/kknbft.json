When you read you are moving at your speed of comprehension and can match your \"input speed\" perfectly to how fast you absorb the thoughts, almost without thinking about it. \n\nFor listening to an audio book or podcast, you need to manually change the speed of the words until it matches the speed at which you absorb it. Otherwise, your brain will move faster than the words and you will get bored and space out.\n\nMy podcast app allows me to set different speeds for different podcasts, which is really nice. Funny podcasts usually sit closer to 1.0x speed because it helps the timing, while more information focused podcasts get a higher speed (1.3x) to keep my mind from wandering.",

My head couldn't keep up with my ears.\n\n I realised that when it comes to books I don't really read them as linearly as I thought - I reread sentences, stop and think about them, bounce back and forth for context.\n\nI don't understand these people who can listen to audiobooks on like 5x speed.",

Think about the temperature difference between your skin and the surface it is touching. Try to feel the weight of your limbs resting against your leg if you\u2019re sitting.\n\nListen without goal. Just listen. If you notice repetitive sounds, experience their pattern. If not, let the randomness make a symphony. You will be surprised how much you will start hearing.\n\nYou can close your eyes if you want to, but you don\u2019t have to. I think it helps.\n\nAfter some time just experiencing your senses, and this is stuff that you can build up to over time, start to notice your thoughts coming to you. This is the hardest part for me: don\u2019t judge the thoughts that come to you. Recognize them, but think of them like a float in a parade, let them pass without trying to assign a positive or negative connection, just experience the thoughts like you were previously focusing on your senses.\n\nThe hard part is letting them pass and allowing others to replace them, and not judging them. I still can\u2019t really do it, but the focused breathing and attention to senses does have its own rewards I think.",

Really, meditation is just focusing on your breathing, deep breaths in and out, until later you realize you\u2019re not thinking about anything at all. \n\nOf course it\u2019s more complicated than that, I highly recommend you check out just about any meditation app. (Headspace is my favorite)\nGood luck :)",

Even just looking at apps - there's so many to choose from and so many competing for our attention, we've been conditioned to change our activity every few minutes.\n\n You can be assessed for free by seeing your GP (UK) if you do think you may have ADHD. They'll refer you on to a specialist to assess and diagnose you, but your GP may also look to rule out other things.\n\nLife has changed a lot (looking at you 2020) which has caused a huge increase in things like shortened attention span and issues processing information, which can also be symptoms of a bunch of other conditions like stress, depression and anxiety. Also don't forget, some symptoms of ADHD can overlap with other less common mental health problems, like complex PTSD. \n\nBasically what I'm saying is, yes, people with ADHD can have issues in focusing on one task at a time, but so can everybody else at times. The difference is a whole host of other behaviours/brain patterns that affect those living with ADHD. Don't overthink it if the only thing you're struggling with is the reading thing.",

It's not always easy - can depend on how old your son is but I would just suggest being persistent, or asking to see a different doctor if there really is no movement. Has your GP given any indication as to why they won't refer? I know they sometimes try \"watch and wait\" for a little while to see if anything changes. \n\nI work in adult mental health, so I know the Adult ADHD Teams sit under secondary mental health services in my area, though not sure if it's also the case for children and young people. If your son is still in education, the school/college/uni, his teachers would be a really good starting point to see if they've noticed anything with his behaviour.  They might be able to give you more specific advice about whats in your area, and how to get him seen by someone.\n\nIf he's an adult, again at least in my area, referral would need to come from his GP. \n\nMore info on the NHS site [here you might find helpful](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/diagnosis/)",

I'm not originally from the UK but I've been here for some years now. I've been trying desperately to get a psychologist referral for a while. Last time I called my GP they said they'd refer me to specialist mental health care (is that the same as secondary mental health services?) but I got a letter from primary mental health services to make an appointment. It specifically said it was a service for general mental health issues and not a specialist service, which I believe is what I need. Do you have any advice for navigating this or any insight into where I am in the referral process or whether Ive been referred to the right place?",

This covers your GP or anywhere you can self-refer to within the NHS. For mental health, this would cover the IAPT service (might be called Wellbeing) which deals with more common mental health issues like anxiety and depression. You might be referred here if you're struggling with low mood/anxiety.\n\nSecondary Care - anything you step up into, usually things that are more long term/urgent or require particular interventions. For mental health, this could be more complex or specialist conditions, such as ADHD, schizophrenia or complications with common mental health issues. You might be referred here to receive a diagnosis, speak with a doctor about medication for more complex mental health conditions, or where you have more severe symptoms of a common mental health problem.\n\nIt sounds like you've been referred to an IAPT service (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies), which is a step between your GP and secondary care in terms of mental health support. Don't worry, this doesn't mean you've just been palmed off to someone. IAPT are designed to support people using a stepped approach, so they'll do an initial assessment with you to determine what's going on and what kind of support you're after. IAPT can support you with self-help strategies and coping mechanisms, and also offer support with different types of therapies and counselling. If they feel after the initial assessment that you require something more than this, they would likely refer you on to secondary mental health services and/or signpost to alternative support like external organisations and charities that offer what you're after. \n\nFirst step is booking that appointment, and if you're not sure what you need you can be honest with them. They're there to help.\n\nHope that helps :)",

No one seemed to agree if I had it or not. Doctors over a certain age looked at the results and said no, you don't have ADHD. Younger doctors didn't even question if I had it based on the neuropsych test.\n\nI was never even asked about family history and the ambiguity of that test haunted me for years before I found doctors who took a look back and went \"what the fuck? Of course you have ADHD.\"\n\nNot saying you do or don't have it, but trust your instincts and senses about your own body. It may not be ADHD but one neuropsych test can seemingly mean something wildly different to different pairs of eyes.",

I mean at the end it was basically like, \"well you display a number of symptoms that overlap, so our best guess is you have depression, either have avoidant or schizoid personality disorder, you're mildly on the autism scale - so why don't you try mood stabilizers to help with your anxiety and depression\". It's nice to have a fuller picture for providers to look at in the future, but it's not like a definitive diagnosis. \n\nMy ADHD rule-out seemed largely based on my ability to sit in front of a computer and press 1 for one stimuli (I think it was a noise), or 2 for another (I think it was something flashing on the screen) over 15 minutes. I wasn't really convinced at the start I had ADHD but that anxiety was a factor, but fuck if it isn't annoying to read a whole page in a textbook and realize you've been looking at it and not absorbing anything.",

I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago (in my 30s), I had no idea I had a ton of other symptoms that no one usually mentions. The ones that are typically thought of, I had already figured out how to deal with (mostly). Timers to keep me in track with whatever I'm working on, tons of lists (sometimes to many), heavy use of calendars (including appointments to set my calendar and review lists), and having very specific places for my important, things I need daily (still hard to remember but most things I keep a back up in the same spot). My medication also helps with these quite a bit.\n\nThe ones they don't talk about are the ones that are the hardest for me to control. I can use timers to keep myself on track for a project but once I'm done there is no more timer. That is a huge problem because ADHD also has the opposite effect also. If I finish and see an ad for something interesting or remember something I saw two seconds of on TV a couple months ago and now that is all I am doing. For example, my friend sent me a text one evening that he bought some raw denim jeans. When I finished looking up what that meant it was 4 am. I had a whole list of which jeans I should buy and knew everything there was to know about them. This happens a lot.\n\nAnother thing that no one mentions, is rejection sensitivity. It's like being Michael from the office but you are self aware you are doing it the entire time and you can't stop. It took me a very long time to start doing stuff because I liked it, or I thought it was cool or fun on a regular basis. The fear of being rejected by anyone is bad but most of time it isn't the fear of it. Rejection from people is constantly happening for me (whether it is or not). And not just strangers, great friends that I've known for a long time are going to eventually reject me because (I have no idea). It's just there with no explanation from stuff that happened in the past. It's hard to fully describe but there are plenty of mental health pages that can tell you the feeling with better words \n\nOh, and a large percentage of people with ADHD have these things but no one mentions it outside of mental health websites. There are many more symptoms that I didn't list that people don't normally associate with ADHD.",

A lot of people do. But for someone with ADHD, it will every time, for nearly everything.

Being distracted while reading or doing any task really, is just one symptom among many that make up having ADHD as well as the fact that these disorders not only present quite differently among men and women, they are also unique to the individual.

Oh, there's a built in dictionary! Oh this passage is important to my studies... I don't even have to take notes. I can highlight it in any color I want and it appears on another notes page within the ereader app. So, you run into the problem of switching between different tasks (reading, taking notes, back to reading) much less.\n\nI've come to see it less as a book replacement and more like a prosthetic that allows me to do something much easier than my disability would traditionally allow.\n\nEmbrace anything that positively grants you abilities where before there was a disability. ADHD brains have trouble with directing and controlling focus. Anyone reading this, don't let it be lost on you that we often have in our hands a device that can do things easily that we can't. At its best, a smartphone can be a co-brain that picks up slack for us that we normally can't. Be a cyborg.",

I literally went from 0 books in 10 years to 30 books in the last year just by discovering I could put audiobooks on my phone.

People think ADHD is just innattention, but you look at studies and every single one seems to paint a much more serious picture of the condition than public perception has caught up with. Offering up strategies and help to one another seems like something ADHD folk are both well suited to (failing a lot means you know intimately the pitfalls of learning and, once you get good at a thing, means you have a more complete map of the path ahead than those who never encountered trouble) and will maybe help raise the tide for us all. It isn't easy to live with a divide between what you want to do and what your body actually ends up doing.\n\nGod bless medicine and therapists.

Sometimes it helps to not have to focus on a page, and just listen. I listen while driving or doing chores or cooking or even during lunch breaks at work. \n\n- Pick a memoir of a celebrity you like (musician, actor, comedian, politician, etc). They usually consist of short essays and you already have a basic knowledge of that person, so it's easy to follow. Bonus points for the audiobook version of these as they're usually narrated by the author themselves! \n\n- There's no shame in putting a book down and walking away from it. Try again later, or try again with a different book. Some books just don't come to you at the right time &amp; will catch your attention differently if you read them later.\n\n- Comics and Graphic Novels count as books. \n\nHope that helps anyone even the smallest bit. Books are magic (when you find the right one).",

Of course, I'm also a very visual thinker with almost no \"audio\" in my mind at all. So I do better with text that is highly descriptive. A neuropsychologist that I work with told me it probably had to do with my brain failing to adequately process small units of speech called phonemes. But I've never gotten tested or looked deeply into the issue to learn more about it.",

I find that I need a distraction from everything else I'm thinking about and since I know the music well it's just background noise and I can focus on reading or whatever else I'm doing.",

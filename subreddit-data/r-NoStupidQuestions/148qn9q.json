    "postText": "Every time me and my boyfriend M (25) have been having sex lately, he has  specifically requested me to lick the back of his balls. It kind of makes me feel weird. I am a F (23), I\u2019ve never experienced this type of thing before. He says licking his balls from behind feels gay, so he\u2019s had me lift them up so I can kind of get behind them? Is this a fetish? Are there special nerve endings on the back of the scrotum?\n\nTL;DR I\u2019ve been licking the back of my boyfriends balls, is this normal?",

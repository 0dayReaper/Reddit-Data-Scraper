Not to mention there are definitely accents here I'm unfamiliar with or leaving out, on top of things like how the Brooklyn accent itself is really a few different accents, Bushwick is going to sound different from Bay Ridge. \n\nI'm from Long Island and people ask me if I'm from Maryland all the time until I code switch and start talking like my mom.

If you don't know London, Waterloo is ON the South Bank of the Thames. Only water separates it from North London. Islington is, as the crow flies, 2.1 miles from Waterloo. That's how short a distance it can change over",

I am aware there is possibly a lot of racism and even classism in the comment I just wrote, but I am only relaying my example from Linguistics class, not assigning value to it. I know not all black people speak the same way anymore than all white people do or any other racial or ethnic group do, but that is just to say that yes, studies have shown multiple times that people who \u201csound black,\u201d often face more negative associations as a result. \n\nThat is the most obvious example of code switching and the most commonly cited in the classes I was in as a teacher,  but code switching is not limited to that. \n\nSoutherners, Appalachians (who are not all southerners, contrary to pop culture), Latin folks, and so on often face issues as a result of having accents and lexicons considered to be \u201cless than\u201d the prestige dialects and accents, so many groups through the US switch to a more \u201cmainstream\u201d way of speaking when in the public eye or outside of their region or social settings with people who share that accent. \n\nPlus many younger southerners do no have as strong an accent as, say, their grandparents because they consume media that is made in other parts of the US and lean into watering down their own accents. Also, if he lived in a larger city in Alabama, he might naturally have less of an accent than a kid from a small rural community. Nashville kids have less strong of an accent than a kid who grows up just an hour or two away from them, just for example.",

I used to work in San Francisco and for a 2002 our office was in the Tenderloin (poor neighborhood) and we triggered our alarm in our offices. Police came rushing in with guns drawn and forced us all on the ground within two or three minutes of us arriving at the office. We were all wearing shorts with the organizations logo. One of my coworkers had an English accent and the cops started harassing him asking where his accent is from. A few years later we upgraded our offices to the Financial Dostrict in San Francisco. Only about 10 blocks away but literally a different world. We triggered the alarm once again. About three minutes later police officers were knocking on our unlocked door. We opened the door and they asked us if we were okay and said yes. They did a cursory walk through to make sure we weren\u2019t being forced to say we were okay then left and wished us a good day.",

Most of the places we went i found people to be very kind and polite, and everything was normal, nice and clean. However in downtown LA i could be in the skyscraper area and everyone would carry their starbucks coffee, dressed for business and have a suitcase, and just 3 blocks away there were long rows of people living in cardboard boxes and struggling dollar stores everywhere. The biggest difference for me is your lack of a social safety net.",

All of Europe isn't the same culture, so why would all of half of North America be the same beast?",

The same goes for the wealth inequality, thousands of people literally homeless and legions of others scraping by and then there are a ton of people living in the fancy condos and multi-million dollar Tudor homes in Mt Tabor and driving teslas around.\n\n I think the thing is that if you are lucky enough to be lucky in America, you are very lucky, but if you have the misfortune of being unlucky, there is no safety net to help you so good fucking luck.",

I also can't believe how much it is to deliver a baby, when it's practically free in NZ.\n\nHigher education is very expensive, very easy to get into student loan debt spiral, as opposed to no interest student loans that we had back home.\n\nTax rate is good though, iirc it was about half (percentage wise) to what I paid in NZ. But if you tack on the extra costs for insurance and other government assistance, it works out to be about the same.\n\nGas and fun cars are so freaking cheap. Wide open roads make for great roadtrips.\n\nThe suburban lifestyle we see on TV or movies is actually pretty accurate. Two car garage, backyard, front lawn, home owner's association etc. Houses aren't cheap but it's at least affordable compared to Auckland.\n\nSo yea, if you are healthy and not poor, it's a great place to be. If you are not at least one of either, I'd recommend other developed countries.\n\nEdit: so there's a bit of confusion on my comment about house buying, I lived in Bellevue for a couple of years (Crossroads, supposedly the ghetto part of the city) and moved south an hour's drive to buy a house. Not saying it's cheap, just compared to Auckland.",

Older Americans are still living in larger houses despite their kids moving out because they have so much stuff to store. The hoarding is borderline ridiculous.

I'm certain people like this live in countries with no safety checks too, and I wouldn't want to drive in any of those countries.",

I actually was in a better position to afford a health issue when I was broke than when I was lower-middle class.\n\nNow I have a job that provides medical benefits so it's not as big of a worry, but if anything would have went wrong I would have definitely preferred making minimum wage than making slightly more.",

            "comment": "As someone from an actually currupt, very violent, poor country, I love it here and would never go back. Sure, it has its  issues, but every country does. USA is the the most important country in the world arguably, so every issue they have is made a huge deal all over the world. \n\nSchools shootings in particular are kind of specific to the US, but stuff like racism and healthcare are issues pretty much everywhere. Don't get me wrong I'd kill to be able to just go to the doctor without having to worry about money.",

If they\u2019re a asking Asian people or ethnically ambiguous people, and the asker is of a different race, they mean your race/heritage. \n\nI\u2019m Asian-white mixed, and that\u2019s always what they mean for me. It\u2019s really annoying (there\u2019s some great humor videos on YouTube that demonstrate why), so I\u2019ll often play dumb. \n\n&gt; Them: Where you from? Me: The USA. Them: Where you *really* from? Me: Boston. Them: No, like *before* that. Me: Oh, I grew up in NYC, in Queens. Them: You know what I mean! Where your *parents* from? Me: My mom grew up in New Jersey, but my dad\u2019s from the Bronx. Them: Ugh. You know what I mean!, like the country or race. Me: Yeah, I know exactly what you mean, but it\u2019s really annoying to have people keep asking. \n\nThe best is when they get exasperated and start guessing. I\u2019ve had a Hispanic person guess I\u2019m Hispanic/Latinx and want to know which island I\u2019m from, and a Native American person ask me what tribe.\n\nEdit: here\u2019s one YouTube video about it: https://youtu.be/DWynJkN5HbQ",

My husband was technically born in one small town and spent his first 4 years there. But he doesn't tell people that's where he's from. He tells them he's from the town where he spent the majority of his childhood and where he went to school. I have been known to tell people the large city I live near instead of my little town because they wouldn't have a clue where I was talking about. It all depends on context what the right answer is. Sometimes, the answer isn't where you're actually from, it's where you currently are from.",

Pack mentality is somethin' we (humans) should be moving away from, at least in my small-town-raised mind.\n\nSometimes funny to see their processing when you say born in 'A', and did most of my growing up/schooling in 'B', or, spent the last few years living in 'C'. \n\nAnd I don't even hate the game, just got bored of popcorn early on.

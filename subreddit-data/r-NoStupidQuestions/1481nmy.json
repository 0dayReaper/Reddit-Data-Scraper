    "postText": "I recently moved into an apartment, my room space is particularly small. I was thinking of getting a bunk bed with a desk underneath.\n\nIt seems like the bunk is more for a younger group, early teens type of bunk, but it's perfect for utilizing the space in my room, I have a gaming desktop with 2 monitors and a lot of desk decorations/accessories from my previous home.\n\nI also have other furniture like a dresser and TV and a small piano trying to utilize as much space as possible. I couldn't find any decently slim-sized bunks with a desk at a decent price.\n\nIf anyone is wondering what the bunk it's called, it's called \"The BattleBunk X Rocker\" im pretty unsure about it. I haven't really talked to or seen adults with bunks anymore, so I don't really know people's opinions on it.",

I would not want to have sex in the top bunk of a bunk bed and it has nothing to do with the aesthetic of it but more the lack of space, sturdiness, hitting your head on the ceiling, etc.\n\nAlso forsure need sturdiness in general.

Classy? ...and sort of made it look like it's clearly a matter of space-saving *design*, rather than like a 17 year old's room, then it would be fine. I went to a young woman's flat once and she had her bed on a platform above her sort-of built in wardrobe. Definitely climbed up to it and down on a ladder, and she was very much a woman and not a child. So - I'd say it's a matter of presentation. If worried, you could consider alternatives, for sure, like a folding down bed from a wall etc.",

As I say, there are other ways to achieve the same thing. Obviously, money and area and general wishes for design come into account, but yeah. Personally, I'd consider it. Then again, it's really a case of doing what you want, matched with how much you care what others think.\n\n[Example](https://images.ctfassets.net/kthggqw6zjg4/NcQXa0g2G5coTwVMlVx7d/5cc524e0bbf885093abbccf095bf0148/NEW_COLLAGE_2.jpg?w=510&amp;h=390&amp;fit=fill)\n\n[Example](https://cdn.homedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tiny-San-Francisco-Apartment-Loft-Style.jpg)\n\n[Example](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/e0/b9/d5e0b9f0d413760130111168bb02fd4f.jpg)",

As you attested to, these types of beds are usually for kids and teenagers. I don't know how tall you are, but at 6' I find it a struggle to sleep on anything smaller than a double, and even that's only achieved diagonally.",

Those ladders are so flipping uncomfortable. \n\nThe one you linked also only a single mattress and has a 100kg limit, so absolutely no chance of getting lucky with that bed.",

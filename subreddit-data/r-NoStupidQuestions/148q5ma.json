    "postText": "I have this app called Outread, where you can read any article, post, or text in the app and adjust it to your reading speed. One of the reading methods this app has is called \u201cflashing\u201d where they flash a certain number of characters in a certain amount of time to increase your peripheral vision so you can just recognize the words. Nonetheless, I just forget what I just read in the end and I end up backtracking and reading the article again.\n\nI tried decreasing subvocalizing and the Feynmann method but nothing seems to work. Reading books doesn\u2019t seem to work for me because my mind just wanders and I\u2019m on the same page for 20 minutes and I can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m reading. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips?",

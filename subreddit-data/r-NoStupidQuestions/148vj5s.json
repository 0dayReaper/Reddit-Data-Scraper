            "comment": "Hi there, I'm a psychologist. Relevant questions here: how long have you been in treatment? How do you get on with your therapist? Have you guys discussed where treatment is going, and made a plan together? Have you raised your concerns that it's not going well?\n\nWithout knowing your situation, it's not possible to say if any of the following may be the case:\n\n\ud83e\udde0 not a good fit with your therapist\n\n\ud83e\udde0 not working in a framework that makes sense to you \n\n\ud83e\udde0 if it's early in treatment, possible that you had unrealistic expectations for how quickly you would start to gain benefit from treatment \n\n\ud83e\udde0 if you've been in treatment a while, possible you've plateaued, are no longer in need of regular treatment, or otherwise are not focusing on the right things anymore\n\nIf it's about fit, you definitely have the right to find a therapist who is a better fit for you. \n\nIf you're concerned about, or not clear on, the treatment program, by all means tell your therapist so you can work together to find an approach that you're comfortable with. This should probably involve a discussion of what you can realistically hope/expect to get out of treatment, and also - this is important - what you need to do other than just attend sessions. Therapy isn't a button you press, it's a collaborative process and does involve you putting in some work between sessions, whether it be things like practising learned skills, making lifestyle changes, experimenting with new behaviours, or even just reflecting on the sessions so you can bring in something to discuss or work on.",

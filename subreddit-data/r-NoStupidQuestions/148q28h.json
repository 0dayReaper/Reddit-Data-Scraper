                    "comment": "Birth doula here. I\u2019ve been to over 500 births, and had an unmedicated birth myself. Let\u2019s talk about it.\n\nPain is subjective. My boyfriend likes to have his dick bitten. BITTEN. Like, hard. As hard as I can go without freaking myself out. And he is not even a masochist. This is a first for me\u2014previous partners would faint at the graze of a tooth, but this one LIKES it.\n\nI have had gallbladder attacks, till I got that fucker removed. They were horrible. Constant pain for hours, till it subsided. I remember being on bands and knees for six hours, having thrown up the oxycodone they had prescribed me in case I had an attack (surgery had been booked but it was a few weeks away), thinking I would rather be in labour than deal with this shite.\n\nI also have hurt my knee. I slipped on a piece of paper that my son left on the floor when he was two. I went one way, and my knee rotated about 270 degrees. You can think about that for a while if you like. I lay on the kitchen floor screaming till the ambulance came. I remember thinking once again, I\u2019d rather be in labour.\n\nChildbirth! Yes, it was intense. But I was very fortunate to have a relatively quick labour for a first timer\u2014eight hours from start to finish, 45 minutes of pushing. At that time, it was the most painful thing I had ever experienced, until the knee and the gallbladder years later. It was fucking intense. But! There were breaks in between the contractions. And pushing was a relief. And there was a purpose to the pain\u2014it wasn\u2019t just me screaming on the floor because my knee was destroyed, it was purposeful pain, I had people with me for support, and the end goal was precious.\n\nNow.\n\nI have been to a LOT of births.  I have seen a lot of things. I have seen many, many instances where contractions seemed like torture, where I said to myself, if this was my experience of birth, I\u2019d have gotten the epidural in a New York minute. And I\u2019ve seen births where folks seemed to sail through, even if it was tough.\n\nEveryone\u2019s experience of pain is different. Not having balls myself, I understand that being kicked there hurts like a son of a bitch. Comparing that experience to birth isn\u2019t fair, though, because the kick lasts a short time (although I know the residual ache can last much longer), whereas birth typically lasts a long time. So if you take, say, a 60 second window: a man has just been kicked in the balls. Set a timer for 60 seconds. Put that on a pain scale of some sort. When we talk about \u201cchildbirth,\u201d what are we talking about? A labour that started normally? Or one that has been induced (inductions are typically more painful than spontaneous labour). Are we talking about contractions at 3cm, 6cm, 10cm? Or while pushing? Or about the whole process? And which birthing person are we talking about? Because I have seen people screaming the house down at 2cm, and I have seen people breathing deeply at 8cm but they look like they\u2019re at the spa\u2014and it\u2019s not about pain tolerance overall, it\u2019s just how labour is for them.\n\nThe bottom line is that I don\u2019t think this comparison is useful or even realistic. I have had more pain and less pain than childbirth. I\u2019m sure there are folks out there who have been kicked in the balls and have experiences more painful than that, even.\n\nChildbirth hurts (almost all of the time, except in niche cases). Being kicked in the balls hurts. It\u2019s all a rich tapestry. Or something.",

Most people who say it is more painful are interpreting it as which reaches a higher pain threshold. In this regard it seems quite likely as gentle hits can yeild considerable pain, while hard hits can easily render them speechless, cause vomiting, and unconsciousness simply as the result of pain. However the question can also be interpreted as over the course of the process who deals with more total pain. In this case labor can last for numerous hours, while most bad nut shots are better in under an hour so birth likely has more pain if you add it over time.",

A woman's brain releases chemicals after giving birth that helps to focus her attention on her newborn baby and not the pain she just experienced. Also, labor is different for everyone. Some may experience more pain, while some may experience less. Also, there are still epidurals. Some women have different pain tolerances. I've heard of some women who have had little to no pain and some who had the worst experiences of their lives. Child birth is not easy for many women. A lot of prenancies aren't even consensual. So if they have multiple pregnancies, it could be from accidental pregnancies, or maybe they just enjoyed the experience of actually having a child and they aren't focusing on the actual labor experience. Child birth isn't what's bad, it's labor. Child birth is a beautiful, life changing experience that many woman crave, or plan to have in the future. If they love the first kid, why not have a second? Maybe they want to kid to have a sibling. I think the reason a lot of women have multiple pregnancies is because they can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just because you know something is painful doesn't mean you don't do it. Woman are so strong for bringing us into this world. Men wouldn't volunteer to get kiked in the balls because they're not getting anything out of it. And the reason why you don't see guys choosing to get kicked in the balls is because there's rarely an occasion that calls for it, it hurts, and they're not getting anything they care about out of it. This doesn't mean it's \"worse\". In my opinion, it's not a comparison. Both are different. Even equal maybe. Pregnancy can affect your entire life, physically, emotionally, and you have to take care of a child, which is beautiful but can be worrisome in some situations. Hell, sex can affect a woman's entire life in society. Getting kicked in the balls can lead to damage but most of the pain is physical. That doesn't mean it's not as bad. Just different",

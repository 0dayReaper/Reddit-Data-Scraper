    "postText": "I don't know how to change a fuse. Here is what it looks like though. And I found a spare fuse to use.\n\nBut I am just worried that I will get shocked if I do this while the power system is on. Do I need to turn my apartment's power off somehow in order to do this safely? How?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1tLkZm4\n\nThanks all! It was fixed safely. We unplugged ALL appliances, then took out the mainfusebox thingy on the top so that our power went out (desired effect), and THEN unscrewed the broken fuse, and screwed in a new one of the same amp. Then put the box back in so power went back on. Bam! All power now working.",

            "comment": "It doesn\u2019t look like you have a shut off switch in that panel. Check with the landlord as to where it is. That said you can still change it without shutting all the power down. Make sure there is nothing turned on for the circuit that is blown, if in doubt unplug the device/ appliances that have no power. You can then change the fuse. \n\nIf the fuse is one of the four in the bottom ( from the pic it looks like the far right) just unscrew the old one and screw in the new one. If it\u2019s an oven or dryer that\u2019s out it will be one of the two top blocks with a handle, inside are long tube fuses with metal ends. Pull the old ones out and pop the new ones in.\n\nImportant Note: make sure you fuses with the same amp rating as the old ones. If you soon blow a fuse again you should let your landlord know there an issue for an electrician to look at. \n\nAlso, since you know what\u2019s on the circuit that\u2019s currently out, write down on a piece of paper or tape what is on that circuit and stick on back of the panel door. ie. kitchen plugs and lights.",

You can change them without turning anything off as long as you don't touch the threads of the fuse while putting them in and out.  (just like a light bulb - you would touch the metal part while change the bulb)\n\nThe most important thing is to place the SAME SIZE FUSE back in.  Make sure the amp number is the same.",

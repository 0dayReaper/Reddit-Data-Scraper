    "postText": "for context, i am a nineteen year old black woman who\u2019s been dipping my toes into online dating.\n\ni had a great conversation with a man, up until i brought up the fact that i wasn\u2019t looking for casual sex.\n\ni brought up the fact that i\u2019m not interested in casual sex many times before in this conversation (it is also in big bold letters in my bio, twice) and he kept saying originally that he was a \u201cgentleman and respecting of women\u201d.\n\nhe then started to bring up urges and all of these other things that started to be red flags. to say what triggered me to ask the question; this is the last message he sent before my last one where he unmatched me.\n\n\u201cSo your saying in this situation your talking to a guy he's a gentlemen opens door takes you out on dates for a couple months respects you never tried anything, one of the few men out here with his own place and car and no kids and your saying the only way he's gonna have sex with you is when he savs he wants a committed relationship?\u201d\n\n\nmy response was:\n\n\u201cyup, sex is not for playtime for me. i want love and intimacy and shit during sex not a quick fuck. look, if you don't agree that's fine but i don't base anything on sex. i don't owe a man anything, i can pay for my own meals, my body is not something to be bartered i'm a human being with feelings just like you are. someone opening doors for me, taking me out on dates, not going as far to take my consent from me, and having his life together as an adult does not grant him access to my body.\u201d\n\ni think it\u2019s just confusing cause i already said multiple times i wasn\u2019t looking for sex, though when i defended my body that was the last straw. i guess what im asking is, why does defending the right to my own body come off as something to unmatch me for? did i just dodge a creep or what?\n\nedit: i\u2019ve gotten some great answers here and i appreciate you all for even taking the time to answer the question :) will be marking as answered thank you again \u2661\n\nanother edit just to clarify: i am 1000000% okay with him rejecting me. i keep seeing you guys tell me to get over it, it wasn\u2019t that serious i just wanted an answer.\n\nedit again sorry: some people still seem to think that we had known each other a long time. we did not! this was during the first couple of conversations and we had not even met in person for the date planned yet.",

I did online dating and even with my pictures and all about me it still seemed to be a complete gamble whether we were going to get on in real life or not.\nAlso just wanna say that urges as a teenage/young man are debilitating and most of the western world does very little to educate people and it can leave someone feeling very isolated. It in no way excuses the range of bad things that men do under this influence but it needs to be addressed. Raising my children what I\u2019m most nervous about it how I educate my boy to keep those feelings in balance.\nStrong boundaries from young women with a very good head on their shoulders, such as yourself, is very encouraging. As you\u2019re taking responsibility for yourself, and not for them. And that sends absolutely the correct message",

Another explanation for why guys act like this is honestly a lot of guys are extremely lonely, low in social intelligence, and lack significant interaction with the opposite sex. Thing is I think this is actually a social issue that\u2019s getting worse over time. \u201cIncels\u201d do not appear for no reason, the rapid rise in how many there are has to be indicative of something. I think men especially my age (20) lack sufficient support systems. It explains perfectly why people like Andrew Tate are so popular, he provided a solution to a growing problem. \n\nRed pill YouTube is toxic men doing the same thing Andrew tate does and they get millions of views. Why? Lonely men who\u2019ve gone down a dark path. I sympathize because I was extremely lonely myself, I just had a family who guided me through life. Not everyone has that.\n\nNot saying all this to mean you should feel bad for this particular guy. He went about this in a bit of a strange way. You two are just incompatible, that\u2019s fine. You communicated well IMO.\n\nIf I can find it I\u2019d dig up some statistics. The amount of single men and women (men in particular) is rising every generation. The amount of virgins is rising. The amount of social interaction we have in general is falling. This is causing problems we don\u2019t even know about yet IMO.",

I think bringing a healthy (meaning NOT blaming and viciously attacking women for every problem) awareness to men\u2019s mental health is crucial. It is hard because mental health generally is such a shit show with less than bare minimum support, convincing men to seek professional help is often difficult enough when there isn\u2019t already such horrible support available in general.\n\nI stay away from the opinions of red pills generally but my understanding is that their belief is that women should be able to fix the problem of rising incels by offering sex? But when they are in that sphere and mindset they are extremely dangerous for us to even be around. They don\u2019t see us as actual human beings which is horrible and terrifying to even hear about, let alone actually engage with.\n\nIt\u2019s all so difficult and I really really hope that there becomes better resources for them to feel included in a community without becoming a great danger to us.",

There is an implicit norm that this is shameful. \nHowever I always had been taught respect for women and to treat them as persons. But I was somewhat frustrated and if you don't have that respect for women (or all persons for that matter) taught I can see how it's easy to project that frustration onto women. \n\nAnd also I still believe some girls when younger they are sometimes impressed by the 'wrong' guys and if you do try to be nice it sometimes can be disheartening that girls find you cute, but would never consider you in a romantic way. Resolving such feelings is key to not let that fester.\nOfcourse usually that's only a half truth, because there is a reason you aren't considered an at the same time when we are young we all need to learn how to pick someone for a relationship, so obviously 'mistakes' are made. \n\nSo I think these are contributing factors:\n\n- loneliness and individulasing society, so community structures are often absent.\n\n- no positive role models which makes it easier to see woman as objects.\n\n- It can seem girls are making wrong choices, because young and it's easily to feel 'I'm better than that guy'.\n(especially more so the more narcistic you are) even now I' am older I sometimes see women with no self respect and they get treated so badly but would never consider me for a relationship. But most women seem to get more self respect and experience as they age.\n\n- implicit or explicit Virgin shaming, which leads to self hate or at leas self conciousness that you don't have an experience other people have had. On top of that:\n\n- toxic masculinity in which feelings about shame or frustration or sadness are rejected and therefore young men have trouble to work through these feelings and they fester. \n\n- porn and other media treating women as objects.\n\nWe need to address all these things to be succesful in preventing this. \nBut it's hard because once 'sucked' in it's always the easy option to blame someone else rather than work through your own feelings, incels are not the only ones doing that.",

Most of these channels are just stirring up these issues to create a following, and blaming women helps with that. Some of the most insecure men are giving advice on youtube, and unfortunately, they're able to look credible enough in the eyes of young men to pull it off. \n\nI think changes in society are affecting men and women, expecting women to \"fix\" this situation makes it seem as if all women came together to create the current situation. Instead, changes socially impact us all, and it's up to all of us to help each other out. Some men's issues must be solved by men, I think we need more positive male role models. Imagine the power of Andrew Tate in the hands of a positive figure, that would do a lot of good for exactly the kind of people who need it. \n\nOverall the internet doesn't seem to make that possible. Humans are strongly biased toward negativity; the more outrageous takes you can create, the more attention you get. Being positive generally isn't outrageous, it'll be a slower path to virality. \n\nMost of all, a lot of people have to touch grass. The perception online of what women are attracted to is so out of touch IMO. There is no \"one\" thing. It all depends on who you're talking to, but it really isn't that deep once you start putting yourself out there.\n\nI should note that the \"red pill\" isn't supposed to exist as it does now. It basically started as an opposition to the typical advice of \"just be yourself.\" That only works if \"yourself\" is not a bum with no hobbies, no interests, can't take care of himself, etc. Basically, make yourself better before you start blaming others for lack of success. At least, that's where I started with the red pill. What it is now is insane.",

Cuz based on the little snippet of the conversation you\u2019ve posted, it looks like he just unmatched you because you made it seem like you\u2019d be platonic for months. \n\nYou yourself even said it\u2019s fine if he doesn\u2019t like that, and he clearly didn\u2019t. \n\nForget the cringy \u201cgentleman\u201d stuff\u2014he asked whether the two of you could get intimate after *months* of platonic dating during which he even admitted he wouldn\u2019t push you on your boundary, and you said no. \n\nThere\u2019s your answer, and I think it\u2019s one you really need to hear because most of the people in here don\u2019t seem to be telling you the truth, which is:\n\n**most guys nowadays simply aren\u2019t willing to wait more than 2-3 months just for a *chance* to get intimate and maybe start a relationship** \n\nI really feel like these people are giving you a ton of false hope which will only lead you to greater disappointment and frustration in the future. \n\n**There just aren\u2019t gonna be all that many guys willing to wait that long. Are there some? Absolutely, but they\u2019re in the minority, so please be aware of that and set your expectations accordingly.**\n\nAlso, what did the guy do that everyone in the comments is trashing him for? It doesn\u2019t even seem like OP is mad at him at all. **Yeah the gentleman spiel is cringy, but I don\u2019t think a little cringe is enough to indict a man\u2019s entire moral character.** It seems like all he did was ask for clarification on your boundaries, which you gave him, and your boundaries didn\u2019t coincide with what he was looking for so he left. Simple as that. \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve posted here it doesn\u2019t seem like he pushed or begged or anything beyond that, and it doesn\u2019t look like he resorted to name calling / insults or anything like that either after he got \u201crejected.\u201d **This seems like a cringy but otherwise completely mature response, and it\u2019s honestly kinda scary that people are being so harsh and so judgmental over something like this**. \n\nWhat was he supposed to do?? Continue talking with her even tho they wanted different things. Seriously, I don\u2019t see how he could have handled this any better aside from dropping the \u201cgentleman\u201d stuff",

My opinion after my own experiences with gay men as well as listening to the angry rants of female friends is that a lot of men seem to think of romantic partners as \"mothers they can fuck.\" They expect you to clean, cook, and take care of them like a mother would, and then also be a sexual object at their behest. This is due to toxic masculinity, and I think if it doesn't come from within the home it definitely comes from right wing pundits getting to them on social media such as Andrew Tate's videos or Jordan Peterson. \n\nFrom my own expeditions into these communities and looking into what these dudes watch, I find that there seems to be an influence online of an incel belief that women only want idealized men, of which they will constantly and endlessly have sex with, but supposedly won't have sex with anyone else, and that the reason these men aren't having sex is supposedly because women exclusively seek sex with these fantastical \"top 20%\" men. This, like any conspiracy theory, usually then falls into a racist subtext of The Great Replacement Theory and antisemitism. It also has a lot of misogyny from a view that women's sexual liberation is somehow an indicator that society as we know it is coming to an end.\n\nIn short, stay informed, stay safe.",

I think men want applause for the bare minimum because I think the bad behavior of men gets talked about abundantly more than the good behavior so the men that can say \u201cI didn\u2019t do that\u201d or \u201cI would never do that\u201d think they deserve a super pat on the back. They don\u2019t. But they really think they do.  I\u2019ll give you an example\u2026I was in a relationship for a very long time where my boyfriend would go to work and pay the bills and that was it.   LITERALLY that was it. While I went to work, took care of the kids, managed the house, Dr appts, rides, outings meals..shopping\u2026 you name it.  And any time I\u2019d express exhaustion or how the balance was WAY off he would remind me of all he did for me and how his paycheck (f*ck mine I guess) was something I should be grateful for.  Now, he was not the father of any of my kids but aside from the financial contribution that he was, he didn\u2019t go above and beyond for them either. I didn\u2019t expect him to. We were together for almost ten years though and I\u2019d have just thought we would function a little more like a family at that point but we didn\u2019t and he reminded me all the way up to the end how grateful I should be that he stepped in and did what he did\u2026. He really tried to make me feel like I was out of line for expecting a mental/emotional relationship with him because he paid bills for a woman who had kids that weren\u2019t his. The LITERAL bare minimum and the man thought he was a god.  It\u2019s a thing and it\u2019s a thing to watch out for because that shit will really make you question your worth.  \u2764\ufe0f good luck.",

That's not a good sign, he probably has no real experience with relationships and thinks if he just gentleman's you hard enough, you'll give up your chaste ways.\n\n2.  Online dating is rough for a lot of guys.  You don't get a lot of responses unless you're a 10/10 claiming to make 6 figures, so he was probably trying to twist himself into what you wanted long enough to trick you into dating him.  For guys, it's like a job hunt. You send out 100 messages and maybe hear back from one person, so you start saying different things and trying buzzwords and hoping something gets you a response and hope you don't screw up the follow up interview.\n\nOnce again, it's not an excuse, just perspective.

The role you choose to fulfill in sex doesn't make you a lesser human being or \"use you up\" or anything like that. You don't need to stigmatize all men as rapists and \"defend\" your body against them. If a guy finds you attractive, there's a good chance he'll also want to have sex with you and might express that. It's just a powerful, natural feeling. According to some evolutionary biology theories, your desire to wait and be safe/selective about sex is also probably natural and biological.

Men crave sexual satisfaction from their first erection until the day they die, whether they can get it up or not. This is something women have to accept about men. You can't wish it away. You can't argue it away. You can't logic it away. Men are made that way.\n\nHowever, women don't have to feel obligated to be a sex toy. This is something men have to accept about women. \n\nIf a man can reach his own junk, he can satisfy himself. This is something men have to accept about themselves.",

            "comment": "As a middle aged woman who has been through a few rodeos, let me tell you what I wished someone had told me when I was your age. \n\nHold on to your standards. A lot of men out there think that dating should work like this- \"I buy you a burrito and open your door and ask you a few questions about yourself to seem like I\"m interested in who you are as a person. In exchange, you will open your legs and let me stick my dick in you. It's very simple so just be quiet play your part.\" \n\nNope. The cost of enjoying my body isn't a burrito. Neither is it ten burritos. It's whenever I fucking feel like it and that might be after one burrito or a hundred. I decide because it's MY body. Heck, depending on how horny I am, it could be zero burritos! Also, I don't owe dude who bought me a burrito an explanation. Nor do I owe him consistency. After one night, us going out for burritos might end in sex. The next time we go out for burritos I might not be up for it. Nor am I obligated to continue with sex once we start down that road after burrito eating. You might be on taking me out for my tenth burrito and I think we're all good and we're making out and having fun and I decide actually I don't want your dick tonight and I'd rather just go home. I can do that. Because it's my body. \n\nBy the way, this rolls over to when you get married too. Marital rape is a thing and it doesn't always look like you think rape looks like. It can also look like coercion and threatening to take away resources like food, shelter, access to shared children if you don't put out. There's a lot of men out there who think that just becuase they married a woman, they are now owed sex with that woman. That's not true. You're never owed sex, ever. No matter if you married her, didn't marry her, gave her a baby, didn't give her a baby, bought one burrito or ten burritos. No man's hard on is EVER your responsibility. It's his.",

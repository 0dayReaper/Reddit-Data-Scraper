    "postText": "(M28) I'm a male Uber driver in a city known for strippers and prostitutes. Usually work late nights on the weekends, that's when the night life is in full swing and there are plenty of passengers to pick up. \n\nEver so often, I pick up one of these girls. Usually age 20-35 female. First one I picked up was a tall girl from a random apartment. She had a box of stuff with her and was very drunk. As soon as she got in the car, she was very talkative and quickly admitted to being a stripper at a place nearby. Ok so smooth sailing so far, some light conversation, she asks me to put on some music. At this point, I have to add. I'm usually friendly with all of my passengers. Its part of my job to at least make them feel welcome and not scared that Im driving them somewhere. \n\nSome music playing, she starts touching me from the back seat. Starts hugging me, touching my face but not in a distracting way, asking me to hold her hand. I play it off and when we reach the destination, she says she wants to ask me a couple questions. Assuming she's just flirting, I decline and tell her we reached the destination. At this point, she keeps embracing me and saying stuff like \"Let me just hug you for this song\" and \"you were so nice to me, why won't you talk to me?\".\n\nHere is my background. While my city is known for clubs and night life, I seldom ever go out. Been to very few dance clubs and never been to any stripper joints. I'm very sheltered. I don't have an idea how strippers usually act, all I know men make fun of other men for thinking strippers are actually interested in them. This story has happened to me about four times now, all good looking girls, so I let some stuff slide. \n\nMy question is, is this normal? Do strippers always act like this? Am I taking something that's supposed to be fun and thinking too much into it?\n\nEDIT: I dont think this is against rules but do correct me if Im wrong.",

You don't need to put up with anything that makes you uncomfortable.\n\n\"Would you like a hug?\" \"no, thank you\" \"why not?\" \"no, thank you.\"\n\nYou could even put up a little sign that say, \"Please don't touch the driver\"",

Women aren't generally taught that no means no from a man. Women aren't generally taught not to touch men or sexually harass men. There's a double standard, because society cares more about the consent of women than the consent of men.",

I can say that when I first came here it felt like a closer community. A lot more reddit-wide in-jokes and memes. Meet ups felt more common. This is back when \"Le reddit army\" became a thing to be mocked, because people from reddit would un-ironically flood youtube comments and places like that, calling attention to where they were coming from. It got super cringey, but shows that people looked at reddit as a whole as a community they were a part of, not just individual subs.\n\nThen around 2016 and 17 things got super duper toxic. Those people had always been here, but for the most part confined to certain subs. During that period it overflowed though. Not getting political here, but there were political reasons for this. Today things are waaaay better as far as that kind of toxicity, but it feels like a much larger community that is less personal than long ago. I think the thing I miss the most is the old AMAs that they used to have. It felt less like advertising (even though it was) and more like these celebrities and public figures were actually reaching out to the public for discussion. Sometimes it went bad (Morgan Freeman, Rampart Woody etc.), but there were a ton more good ones. It was cool to actually have a good chance of getting an off the cuff response from an AMA participant. Things are far more commercial on today's reddit, but not nearly to the extent that the admins and people involved in the business aspect of the site would have wanted it to be by this point.\n\nAnyways, this is just my opinion. I absolutely know that other people have different takes on how things have progressed on reddit through the years and that's cool. One of the best aspects of this place is how varied experiences can be depending on which subs you frequent.\n\nSorry for the novel.",

Searching Reddit with Google works fantastically, and Reddit knows that, so there's no reason to spend developer hours attempting to create a feature that competes against Google's far superior feature. And, even if they did make something comparable to Google, Reddit users aren't gaining any additional functionality. They'd simply be moving the functionality from Google to Reddit. So, they choose to spend their dev hours on other features that Google can't do for Reddit.",

Its priority is the bottom line. Maybe users don\u2019t like the awful search function, but no one\u2019s going to leave the site because of it. That being the case, why would you invest resources fixing something that\u2019s going to give you zero return on that investment? As much as people complain, they\u2019re apparently happy enough using google search instead, so there\u2019s your solution.\n\nAnd actually, most of the time people talk about this, it\u2019s from a current user\u2019s perspective, but I would bet reddit cares way more about new user acquisition, and from that perspective, reddit might actually be incentivized *not* to improve their search. As it is now, you have a big group of people (current users) going to google and performing searches with the specific intent on finding a result from *your website*. That\u2019s gotta do wonders for bumping your site up on google\u2019s search results, so when a non-user googles something, it makes it that much more likely they\u2019ll see reddit and thus more likely for reddit to gain a new user.\n\nSo basically, with a bad search function, reddit has a big group of people helping their SEO efforts for free.\n\nSo why would they improve the search function?",

It\u2019s not just a text search but a contextual text search across limitless domains that makes it difficult.\n\nSay you type the word \u201coil\u201d in there. The modifiers that weight one post or another change depending on if you also write \u201colive\u201d or \u201cautomotive\u201d in there as well then you need to weight the sub based on some algorithm: does the 2k member artisan olive oil sub get boosted by content or number of members (which could be considered accuracy vs precision) then know to do that for every single potential topic that might have a sub or a post.\n\nGoogle makes it look easy, but they have a crap ton of very good engineers working on this as their full time job (minus 20% unless they don\u2019t do that anymore).\n\nGoogle can do it because it\u2019s core to their business model. For Reddit it\u2019s not. They can just rely on people using google or DuckDuckGo and focus on their core competencies and save the money required to do it well.",

The theory is that lots of people use the sites name as a keyword, which increases SEO due to Googles algorithm seeing it a lot, and therefore driving more traffic to Reddit.\n\nIt may just be a coincidence, but that one makes sense to me.",

Google has managed to turn themselves into thee search engine via their indexing and searching processes. It is part of the reason bing has taken awhile to become a decent search engine. Most websites have pretty bad search engines. The smaller  ones will work better since there is less data, but once the site gets bigger it becomes more difficult. I'd also guess that reddit also doesn't invest too heavily in building their search engine.",

On a \"traffic per employee\" basis Reddit likely has one of the most severe ratios on the internet. Sometimes that's OK, because some things only require a small number of people, but search isn't one of those things. Search is expensive and difficult to do well, especially across the breadth (e.g. videos with titles but no description, memes, etc...) and depth (e.g. comment trees) of content that Reddit covers.",

The trade-off for higher magnification in a telescope is that you take a picture of a smaller area.",

I don't think you understand how huge the Earth is. At any scale the curvature of the Earth is visible, it doesn't matter how high the resolution is; you will not be able to make out something as small as a boat.",

If your picture was real, that plane would have to be *hundreds of miles* long. Even if we had a picture that was at a high enough resolution to show planes (which I'm not sure is possible), for the plane to actually be visible, you'd have to zoom in so far that you could no longer see the curvature of the Earth, and it'd just look like an ordinary picture of a plane, seen from far above at an angle.",

Besides, Google Earth mostly uses aerial photography for its image data, not satellite photography, since it gets better resolution for lower cost.",

Because everything in the background would also be magnified to that same degree. The degree of what physically or visually appears in the photo is relative to the level of magnification needed to see it. The magnification needed increases as the distance of the camera increases from the subject of the photo, yet at the same time, you can only see a certain resolution at a certain level of detail.\n\nDoes that make sense? Have you ever seen this? [https://www.in2white.com/](https://www.in2white.com/)\n\nZoom in. You can see the individual *cracks* in the rockface of the mountain... but at a zoom level where a majority is out of frame and thus not visible at that level of detail.\n\nYou can't see an ant on Earth, as if you were physically close enough to personally see it at that detail, and simultaneously the entirety of Earth. I think that would involve some sort of quantum-quantum mechanics that we're nowhere near ready to even comprehend if it's even possible.\n\nThis question is fascinating. Quite a deepthink and I'm not even high.",

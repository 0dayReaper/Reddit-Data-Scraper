Going to the court. 2. Make a diplomatic &amp; social media stink about it. 3. Economic sanctions against the owners and related companies (companies that share major shareholders, sponsors, business partners).\n\nThen there's the unreasonable one, which is less likely but not completely impossible. Diplomatic kidnappings. Arresting citizens from that country Inn trumped up charges until the Panda is returned.\n\nI've l them in the order and likelihood that I believe they'll happen.",

Have they had a more lucrative lease offer from another zoo elswhere in the world that doesn't have a good track record of looking after animals.\n\nYou say the chinese care about them but they have been shipping them out as rentable assets for years and lets face it china doesnt have a very good reputation for human rights and welfare let alone those of animals. \n\nP.s.They eat just about anything and im sure if the pandas weren't endangered and they had a plentiful supply they'd be eating panda steaks.",

It is the same scenario as if a vehicle, artwork, or other valuable property was stolen.\n* Civil court action would be taken against the suspect zoo to recover all costs associated with the recovery operation.\n* Criminal charges of fraud and grand larceny would be filed against the management of the suspect zoo.

If someone tries to steal the pandas, then law enforcement will immediately become involved, just as they would if any other valuable item was stolen.  Here is a direct quote from Wikipedia regarding the process:\n\n\"In 1984, China's leader Deng Xiaoping modified the policy, such that subsequent pandas would be leased, instea just as they would if anything d of gifted, beginning with China presenting two pandas to Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympic Games for $50,000 per month per panda. This practice was again modified in 1991 in favor of long-term leases. China began to offer pandas to other nations only on ten-year lease. The standard lease terms include a fee of up to US$1 million per year and a provision that any cubs born during the lease period be the property of the People's Republic of China.\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda\\_diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy)",

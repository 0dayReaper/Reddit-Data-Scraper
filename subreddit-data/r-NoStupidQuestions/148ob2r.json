His primary audience was edgy teens in the beginning.  \n\nToday, he's pretty washed up, but still relatively rich.  He produces maybe 10 videos per year, typically lazy vlog content pretending to be documentaries.  I think he also has a conspiracy theory podcast.\n\nHe's also full of YouTube controversies ranging from petty internet drama to potentially being a sex pest.",

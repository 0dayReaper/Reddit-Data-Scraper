            "comment": "Depression is, by nature, negative. Beyond the mental health connotation, you could attempt to think of it in the context of its other meanings, if having the typical connotation pop-up in your mind really bothers you. A depression in furniture, an economic deppresion (a general decrease). This is not great advice, but I'm trying here. Generally if you want to unattached an emotion from something, I try to break it down scientifically (or linguistically, in this case) and understand it.",

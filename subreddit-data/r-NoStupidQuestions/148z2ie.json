    "postText": "Well he\u2019s not really a kid, next year he\u2019ll be 18, but I\u2019m worried about the headspace he\u2019s is right now. It just seems like most things have continued to get worse for him as he has gotten older. When he was younger he was quite tall compared to his peers, but he hasn\u2019t grown since 14 and stands at 5\u20198\u201d now. He also gets cystic acne on his nose which not only makes his nose look big and swollen, but many of those cysts have remained on his nose. Another thing, he used to have very thick coarse hair, but he\u2019s been receding since he was 16, which I don\u2019t even understand because nobody else in our family has really suffered with hairloss. I know it sounds like I\u2019m almost targeting my son here just listing out his characteristics like flaws, but I just wanted to provide context. Because I think it\u2019s due to these things above that he has developed anxiety and likely some level of depression. He doesn\u2019t spend time with his friends anymore, most of his time is spent in bed or looking in the mirror. And this year after he worked his butt off to earn a 4.7 gpa, he simply said it didn\u2019t matter because of his 3.3 from freshman year. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to say anymore because it seems like no matter what I say, he seems to be unreceptive.\n\nAnd yes we\u2019ve tried therapy and medications for the cysts and medication for the hairloss, nothing has worked.",

I really don't have any advice but thank you so much for trying to help him. I hope he gets better soon. It can be really challenging to find a solution when someone is unhappy with their appearance",

He's dealing with a lot of pressure from multiple places emotionally and mentally. \n\nWhen I lost my adopted dad (long story) to lung cancer I was inconsolable until his attorney gave me his final letter to me as part of the estate. Within that letter was the one thing that helped me more than anything. He wrote in there that even though we weren't bound by blood I was his son. He loved me and that he supported me in anything and everything I'd ever do. He knew I saw myself as basically a mass of scar tissue and a failure of a human being (part of the long story). That little bit of encouragement helped me more than I can ever say. He saw me falter and fail at things. He saw me achieve things that seemed impossible in more ways than one. But through it all he loved and supported me until the time of his passing and beyond. I know this is a an apples and oranges comparison but sometimes that extra boost is all a person needs.\n\nRemind your son that no matter what he's achieved or will achieve, you love him, that you'll always support him in his endeavors and that he'll always be your son. Be there for him as much as you can. That's all one can really do.",

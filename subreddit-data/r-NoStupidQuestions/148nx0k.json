It\u2019s a deck building card game. \n\nLike Magic, there are money cards (like mana) and action cards (like spells,) along with victory cards. You start out with a 10 card deck, and can spend money cards to buy better money cards or action cards. Once bought, you put them into your discard pile, which gets shuffled when you draw out your deck. You can then play/cast these for free on subsequent turns, with the goal of getting an engine that lets you buy lots of victory cards. The winner is the player with the most victory points, which get tallied at the end of the game.",

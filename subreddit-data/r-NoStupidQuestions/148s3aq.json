Also because where I work there are LOTS of gnc, nonbinary, and trans people so you really never know!!! I have been surprised by some pronoun reveals, a few ppl in my department who appear cis actually use only they/them. It's also a matter of wanting to be respectful towards people...the assistant manager of our department is nonbinary and uses they/them, but because they never corrected anyone when they were referred to as otherwise I didn't even know for months, until I saw their email signoff. If we had introduced ourselves with pronouns, I know a lot more people in the department would use their correct pronouns instead of assuming, which would probably be nice.",

I either had to announce my incongruency or whimper the ones I wasn't too comfortable with (although I feel I now have made peace with those parts of myself). It was honestly very distressing and uncomfortable. I never went there again. \n\nI know I'm not alone- I'd much prefer people aren't put on the spot to out themselves and are given the fluidity to talk about their preferred pronouns in their own time.

It\u2019s meant to be as inviting as possible and allows people to get to know each other\n\nAlso, as a college student, a *lot* of people are gender-nonconforming. It genuinely is needed for a lot of colleges, because you never know someone\u2019s pronouns until they tell you. It avoids a lot of confusion and misgendering if you just say it at the beginning\n\nAll this to say is that stating your pronouns I super fucking common and shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise to anyone anymore. As I said I\u2019m a college student, but I also work for a remote law group and we always state our pronouns as a formality because you don\u2019t always know through calls or text.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly blaming anyone who doesn\u2019t get this idea, but stating pronouns with your name is just a very non-discrete and polite thing to do for both yourself and others around you",

Not too taxing because in my last job of 19 years I flew a lot and was always *First Name*.

I let it slide, thinking I'd get it straightened after hiring. That was a mistake. So far I've got one guy at work who calls me *Middle name*.\n\nTLDR: First impressions stick.",

I'm learning Japanese, and one thing stands out to me that we refer to ourselves with a (usually) gendered pronoun, whereas in English we don't. If I use \"boku\" to refer to myself, it gives a lot more context than \"I,\" and sorta tells people I'm a bit masculine. I think English lacks a lot of little nuance like that, which is cool for being more vague about things, but does mean we need to go out of our way sometimes to add clarity. \n\nI'm not partial to any particular English pronouns, so stating mine (any) is super unnecessary, but I get why people might want to. It's generally seen as rude to misgender someone (including, if not especially, cis-gendered people), so it's just a thing to tell someone what's polite. I'm not sure yet if Japanese has a way of taking out the guesswork of whether you need to add -san or -sama when trying to be overly formal with someone whose status you're unsure of, but I imagine it would be kinda like someone telling you to use -sama ahead of time so that you won't accidentally say -san and make them angry. Or like a young woman telling you she doesn't like being called -chan at her age, so you know to use -san instead. It's less awkward to tell people ahead of time than to correct them afterward, in my opinion.",

The reason for this is that it\u2019s a good way of signaling to others that I will respect their identity, while helping to normalize the use of pronouns. \n\nI\u2019m a 6\u20193\u201d white man, age 30, with a mustache. I want people to feel safe around me, and bigots to know that me being another cis white guy doesn\u2019t mean I agree with the vile comments.",

We need to get to a world where a slight foul is shrugged off and chalked up to life experience.  Everyone does not deserve a pound of flesh for every social slight.  So if you want to share your pronouns, sexual orientation, political party and religion without prompting that is your right to do so and loudly without shame.",

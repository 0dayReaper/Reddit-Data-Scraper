Think of every survival trait needed to make it a week without getting sick from what you kill and cook it's exhausting to even think about it. \n\nThen you need clean water which practically every abundant source of natural fresh water is already taken/occupied so you'll have to filter and clean your own from less than optimal sources. Just live on grid man.",

Maybe start there and learn everything you need for that, plus get the gear like water filters etc. Once you're adequate on that, you'll need to learn how to hunt/gather food if you're planning to be out there indefinitely. Or how to grow food I guess depending on what kind of off the grid we're talking about. Next you should learn some kind of nursing/something beyond just first aid. A Wilderness First Responder is an 80 hour course that's designed for when you're out somewhere where help is not on the way, but it's still pretty basic if that's going to be all your medical knowledge. A Wilderness EMT is also a thing and is the next level up, I think it's about a month of training and you can get it through NOLS (probably expensive though). Also you'll need to learn how to store food, I'm sure there's lots of people doing the homestead thing who have YouTube channels and stuff you could start doing.",

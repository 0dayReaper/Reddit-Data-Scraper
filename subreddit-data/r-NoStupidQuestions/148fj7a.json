            "comment": "Smaller chips means faster computers because the distance the electricity has to travel is shorter. It also makes that less electricity is needed in total to run the chip. We're actually bumping up against the physical limitations of computer chips right now, fun fact. We literally cannot make them smaller.",

However, that was in a research lab, and they spent millions of dollars building that one transistor.",

            "comment": "Yes, there are a few significant advantages you get when building smaller transistors. But there are a few misconceptions floating around here.\n\nTransistor switching frequency isn't determined by channel length but rather by gate capacitance. Larger gates (the thing switching the transistors) generally have a larger capacitance. Large capacitance also increases power consumption: You need to load and unload the gate every time you switch the transistor. \n\nThen there is flash memory, which only works because things are so small that electrons sometimes ignore the laws of (classical) physics. \n\nAnother point is manufacturing. Any tiny spec of dust embedded in the silicone or anywhere during the manufacturing process may kill the entire chip. Assuming you need a fixed amount of transistors for a chip and your ability to build clean rooms doesn't change, increasing the chip area will decrease the likelihood of it working.",

If you take away the supply voltage the tunneling is not possible anymore and a charge gets trapped and information is retained even during a power off state.",

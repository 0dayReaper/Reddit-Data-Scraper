            "comment": "tl:dr It's an artifact of the 80s/90s that rode in on century-old waves of panic about 'sexual psychopaths'.  \n  \n**These are cherry-picked excerpts and I have left a great deal out.  Go read the articles for yourself.  This post is meant to help frame part of the question, not an attempt to answer it.**  \n  \nMONSTERS, INC.: A Concise History of Sex Offender Laws  \nhttp://oncefallen.com/history.html  \n  \n&gt;Prior to 1870, sex crimes were rarely depicted in the media, but in the 1880s, to sensational stories help to cement our fascination with the \u201csex killer\u201d \u2013 HH Holmes and Jack the Ripper. The term \u201cRipper\u201d was used to stereotype sex offenders for many years to come. With this sudden fascination with serial killers and \u201csex fiends\u201d came increase reports from the media, peaking in the early 1910s. During this time, the modern stereotype of the sex offender as a dirty old man/stranger on the prowl to seduce children with toys were candy was already starting to take shape (Jenkins p. 34-38).  \n  \n&gt;The 1930s was a time of unparalleled economic and instability, so it is little surprise that a series of high profile cases helped create an appearance of a violent crime wave. Sensationalized cases such as The Lindbergh baby kidnapping, the Cleveland Torso Killings, and Albert Fish solidified the fears over \u201csex killers\u201d. The prominence of a national media helped to make previously localized crimes a nationwide concern (Jenkins p. 49-52). As a result of these laws, a number of reactionary laws and strategies designed to handle the perceived crime wave, including civil commitment laws, lists of known sex offenders, and castration laws were introduced (Jenkins p. 80-82, Leon p. 46).  \n  \n&gt;[In the 1950s to 1980s] Skepticism of the justice system eventually extended to rehabilitation efforts. Rehabilitation was seen as a myth, and a paradigm shift to a punitive \u201cjust desserts\u201d doctrine was propagated by the government (Jenkins p.112-113). The Gay Rights Movement also fueled fears of \u201cpedophile rings\u201d, and the newly formed \u201cMoral Majority\u201d used these fears as anti- gay rhetoric until the AIDS epidemic provided a better avenue for exploiting public fears (Jenkins p.124-125). Pornography and obscenity as a cause for sexual deviancy became a primary focus in the 1970s, and a number of unconfirmed (i.e., bogus) statistics were cited to justify this fear (Jenkins p.145-147).  \n  \n&gt;In 1990, the sensational trial of Earl K. Shriner led Washington State to pass a comprehensive \u201csexual predator\u201d law. Washington\u2019s legislature passed sex offender registry and community notification laws, and long-term indefinite sentences coupled with civil commitment laws (Jenkins p.191-192). The view of the sex offender as an uncontrollable monster than cannot be cured but contained supported an \u201canything goes\u201d approach to dealing with sex offenders. While this idea was not unique to this era, the unanimous support and widespread dissemination of laws are unique to the Containment Era (Leon p.113-114).  \n  \n&gt;Registration and community notification laws made the public participants in the supervision of sex offenders. This is a very dangerous precedent. Sex offenders became targets of overt acts of vigilantism. Family members of those impacted by these laws and even victims were endangered by sex offender laws. These actions have been justified by the perceived extreme harm caused by offenders, their immunity to treatment and reform, and the danger posed to children (Jenkins p.199-200, Leon p.183-185).  \n  \n&gt;Each wave of predator panic has held the same basic belief\u2014the image of the sex offender as an \u201cincurable\u201d \u201cmonster\u201d complete with ominous-sounding terms like \u201csex fiends\u201d, \u201csexual psychopaths\u201d, and \u201csexual predators\u201d. The monster mantra justifies novel approaches to addressing sex crimes to isolate and contain the sex offender. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the wave of skepticism that follows a collapse of the monster paradigm. The pendulum swings between the sex offender as a nuisance or sick but treatable person and the incurable monster, though the pendulum tends to spend more time on the incurable monster side of the spectrum.",

No, silly, she didn't figure out the flat number and tell him \"you might want to close your curtains, love\"  or slip an angry note under the door - she, being a truly law abiding citizen, watched him until she was suitably enraged by the sight of his wobbly bits and then phoned the police. Who offered to go round and tell him to close his curtains, because the only other option was to arrest him for public indecency and obviously that would be ridiculous.\n\nNope, she decided she would like to press charges for the terrible injustice done to her when she stared at his  nakedness, without telling him, through his window. \n\nAnd she bloody won. Now the poor guy has a charge on his record that makes it sound like he was flashing an old lady.",

People get passionate about a lot of things related to sex, from abortion to gender differences. So it doesn't strike people as strange when we ask a sex criminal to inform their neighbors of what they've done, in fact people's gut reaction is to accept the idea.\n\n\nI guess it's always been like this.

You're more likely to be raped by a partner for example, because you have sex with them so there will be more \"opportunities\" for them to cross a boundary. Remember, most rapists don't consider themselves rapists or believe that what they did was rape - that's part of the reason why the idea of \"false accusations\" is so prevalent. Many rapists believe they are falsely accused, because their rape didn't fit this common trope of what a rape is supposed to look like.",

In reality, the overwhelming number of sex crimes are committed by people (A) not on the registry and (B) by someone known to the victim already.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that forcing people to be on a sex offender registry actually can have the opposite effect of making the public safe. The offender ultimately has a more difficult time reintegrating into society after their criminal sentence has been served. People who cant reintegrate fall into a much higher category of recidivism.\n\nObviously, something needs to be done with the higher risk sex offenders, I'm just unconvinced a public registry is the answer.\n\nSo no, I don't think registries for other crimes are appropriate either.",

I can\u2019t work or live in most places. Nothing I do will change the public\u2019s perception of me. So hey, might as well keep offending. What else have I got to lose?\u201d\n\nIn fact the idea that sex offenders are more likely to reoffend than other types of criminals is also a myth. We were going over this topic in my psych class. In the majority of studies the sexual recidivism rate is under 20% which is lower than the recidivism rates of other types of crimes. (https://www.smart.gov/SOMAPI/sec1/ch5_recidivism.html)\n\nBottom line is this issue is way more complex than people like to think. And as a society we\u2019ve failed to analyze it in a rational manner. Which is understandable since sexual predation is such a sensitive topic.",

Nudity and sex isn't nearly as taboo in a lot of other countries as it is here in the States, whereas our tolerance for incredibly violent content is much higher than a lot of other countries.\n\nThe perfect example of the two comes from February 2004:\n\nOn Feb. 5, Janet Jackson's \"wardrobe malfunction\" during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show would come to define overblown controversies for years. With how controversial that was at the time, you would've thought Timberlake stripped her nude and raw-dogged her right there on stage. But, no, all that happened is that her pastie-covered breast was exposed for a second, but the fallout was fucking legendary: Jackson's singles were barred from certain Viacom/CBS-owned radio stations *worldwide*, and the write-in campaigns from conservative groups to the FCC lead to Viacom/CBS being fined.\n\nTwo weeks later, The Passion of the Christ was released in theaters and [would go on to be the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/mpaa_title_lifetime_gross/?by_mpaa=R&amp;ref_=bo_tt_ar) (Deadpool didn't even beat it). A movie that depicted what could only be described as religious torture porn (that even Saw couldn't match later that year) was flocked to by the very same conservative religious groups that called for Jackson's blood for daring to show some breast on live TV.",

After luring Megan into his home with the promise of a puppy, Timmendequas raped her, strangled her to death, and dumped her body in a park two miles away. He willingly led police to Megan\u2019s body the next day and confessed. This was the first time Megan\u2019s parents became aware that the man who moved directly across the street from them had not only been convicted twice already for molesting other young girls like Megan, but was living with two roommates who were also registered sex offenders\u201d\n\nMy finding shows that when a person \u201ccommits lewd acts using force, fear, violence, or duress upon a child under the age of 14, with the intent of arousing or appealing to the sexual desires of that person, and is punishable by 5, 8, or 10 years in prison.\u201d If I\u2019m wrong correct me.\n\nEither way, a child can\u2019t defend themselves. They don\u2019t know any better. They\u2019re preyed on because of their youthfulness not because of who they are as people. Serial killers are repeat offenders who typically have \u201ctypes\u201d and will get life or death once caught. A child molester has a chance at getting out, mental illness in tact, with their \u201ctypes\u201d everywhere.",

            "comment": "In the 80's, a kid named [Jacob Wetterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jacob_Wetterling) was abducted, raped, and killed. His killer was not found for *decades* as part of another abduction/rape case.\n\nHis parents, having to face the atrocity of what happened and the lack of closure, became huge advocates for what we now know of as the sex offender registry. They spread their story and it was the exact right time to whip the country into a frenzy-- *their* kid was abducted from his sleepy little town, just out being a kid, and no justice was ever found (at the time)-- **and your kid could be next**.\n\nThe country demanded fast, huge change.\n\nAnd so, the sex offender registry was adopted-- in various forms across various jurisdictions-- but Jacob Wetterling was the start.\n\nSo to hammer the point home: The sex offender registry, in some areas, has strict requirements like informing your neighbors of your status because the country went ape shit over a little kid being abducted from their \"safe\" neighborhood. \n\nAnd the illusion of safety was absolutely shattered and the reaction-- *over*reaction in my opinion, but that's a debate for another time-- was what we ended up with.\n\nMurder and kidnapping never had quite as big a single, explosive push as the Wetterling rape case had, so there was never quite the same reaction. But the creepy fucking fuck who abducted Wetterling scared the shit out of people and was seen as-- more than anything else-- a sexual deviant.  (e: I should add here that they *suspected* one guy all along but never had any evidence-- I don't recall if they actually pushed him in their public story, but a creepy sex stalker perv was definitely the image the masses took hold of)\n\nThe kidnapping and murder were just incidental to the rape, and that's what scared most people-- there's rarely a reason (in the minds of the public) to kidnap and murder a kid, unless there's rape/sexual motivation. That terrified people-- the idea that a perv would come around, stalk your kids and snatch them off the street.\n\nI got most of my information about this from a podcast mini-series called *In the Dark*-- it's a good, informative podcast that's kind of like *Serial*-lite-- they're obviously riding the coattails of Serial's popularity, but that doesn't make it a bad podcast.\n\ne: It's worth noting that, as far as I can tell-- the rapist/killer in the Wetterling case committed several of these types of crimes, but was never convicted until decades later. So the sex offender registry *wouldn't have actually helped* Wetterling-- it was just the *idea* that a sexual deviant could commit these acts that scared the shit out of people. At least, that's my understanding, but I could be mis-remembering the details a bit.",

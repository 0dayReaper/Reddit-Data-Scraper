    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m not looking for sympathy, but I want to know how to deal with the loss of my closest friend. I lost my cat today, I didn\u2019t notice the signs she was sick until she was already gone\u2026 if I could go back and get her the help she needed I would. But I know that\u2019s impossible. \n\nRight now nothing feels okay or right. I\u2019m scared to go to sleep because I know I\u2019ll wake up and forget what happened momentarily. And that shock\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to process it. \n\nI feel guilty\u2026 I didn\u2019t notice she wasn\u2019t eating, until I asked my dad if he fed her, and he said he thought I did, and yet her food and water was still full. She was hiding under the sink when I found her. She sometimes does that randomly, but this time was different. I don\u2019t know how to continue forward. I\u2019ll never hear her meow or feel her purr again. \n\nI\u2019ve been told it wasn\u2019t my fault, and that the signs were only obvious in retrospect, as even other people saw her the day before and thought nothing of her behavior or appearance\u2026\n\nShe was the most loving and pure cat I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nI can\u2019t even see my therapist to discuss this which is why I\u2019m asking here. I\u2019ve tried distracting myself but then I feel like I\u2019m not grieving respectfully or properly. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is too serious or grim a topic. I just didn\u2019t know where to ask.",

            "comment": "Hi. Im so sorry to hear about your pet. Unfortunately, cats are very good at hiding illness/discomfort. I've lost 2 kitties in the last 6 months. One was very old and I was kind of waiting for it, but the other was only 2 and seemed very healthy and normal until the last 24hrs. Please don't beat yourself up about it. The signs, even if there, are often so subtle as to be easily missed. It doesn't make you a bad cat-mum.\n\nI wish I had some advice that would help make it hurt less, but I really don't. It's just something that we all muddle through. \n\nIn our family, when we lose a pet we like to bury it in the yard and plant a tree over it. I find the circle-of-life feeling of growing something there to be comforting, and I'll often say hello when I'm watering, tell them about something that happened that day or something.\n\nWhen you feel ready, you might want to open yourself up to the idea of a kitten or other new pet. Not to replace your kitty, of course, but to fill your need to snuggle and care for something. In my experience, it really does help.",

I feel like even though I didn\u2019t directly, part of me feels responsible for her death. I was her caretaker. The world doesn\u2019t feel the same anymore\u2026 \n\nI just wish I could have been a better cat parent. She wasn\u2019t very old, 6 years in fact. I knew I had black mould in my previous abode, didn\u2019t put two and two together\u2026 plus I was in an admittedly annoyed rush to clean the mess (she had defacated on the floor/ herself, which she sometimes did when startled/ stressed) and am worried that shook her up enough to push her over that edge of life. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think the sink was an odd hiding place at first, she did that when I first moved in, a few months ago. But in hindsight\u2026 \n\nHer body tightened up and she passed as I was cleaning her..,\n\nI\u2019m sorry to vent like this, I just\u2026 am at a complete loss.",

            "comment": "Why can't you see your therapist?\n\nIt SUCKS. It is the worst. People who say stuff about \"just a dog....' or whatever are phenomenal assholes. Ignore them. It's worse than losing most people.\n\nThere's likely no one else you take care of every day, feed, clean up, sleep in the bed with. \n\nThat said, it will get better. You won't forget her. You'll still regret, you'll still think about her, but it will feel better than this and you can remember how good times you had together and how much you love her.\n\nAlso, there are support groups. \n\nGoogle your area + pet loss support. Some big animal hospitals run them, Bide-A-Wee has some, some are online if not near you.\n\nIt's just people who are going through the same thing and understand and meet to talk about it and support each other. It can help. Good luck.",

I jsut dont get it. \n\nIf i ever have kids why should i tell them such a lie? and not just be honest about what christmas is?  \nTo me getting and giving a present to a loved one / child is much better that \"hey some imaginary figure gave that to you\"..   \nEven saying that christmas is just about love and not gifting seems better.",

Even in my 20's I \"still believe\", mostly just for the laugh of it. \n\nPersonally, I'll definitely do what your mom did for you for my daughters (gifts from different fictional characters). I think it's more about the fantasy of it and the magic and wonder it brings to kids. \n\nI loved waking up on Christmas morning to see what Santa brought, or even just from what might have happened during the night. A few years my parents/mom dis some cool cool stuff. \n\nOne year my Dad left ashy boot prints by the fire place, another year my mom left a ripped wrapping paper trail all the way to the tree with a ripped open Grinch puzzle (from the Grinch). If my daughters ask I'll let them tell me what they believe, but I'll still try to bring that magicalness into their childhood regardless of whether they believe or not.",

I think it was good so I never became more entitled and expected more from my parents. As some of the other posts said it made things magical because not only the lore of santa but it was the one time of year I could get a toy that I often saw the kids at school with. And once I realized Santa wasn't real it just made the gifts more special.",

This was harped on rather seriously not just for Santa, but in everyday life, too. Even bragging about your legitimate accomplishments was strongly discouraged. I think this value being widely shared throughout the community back then made it so that more \"Santas\" showed up for kids like you with gifts that were special, instead of \"oh I bought the cheapest shit off the shelf and dropped it in the collection bin, so I'm awesome\".\n\nIt's just how society changes over time, so it's nobody's fault, but I can't help but believe the reason so many kids have and will continue to be left out when it comes to Santa is because fewer people \"believe\" in being Santa to others these days.",

I didn't know what to say so I just agreed. She said her friend who was 14 at the time still.believed in Santa. And the 12 year old and the mom did actually use it  in just that way : be good , even when I don't see it, Santa knows and won't bring you presents. Or even \"be good or I'll tell Santa \" \nSeems kinda crazy to me",

I don't understand why so many 'christians' have given rise to this 'good point, bad point' system. The whole point that Jesus actually talks about is that we all have more bad points than good ones, we are innately selfish creatures, and Jesus' death is the payment we deserved for our 'bad points'. That's why 'grace' is such a huge word in Christianity...every christian should realize they're not a 'good person', but they've accepted the grace of someone else paying the price for their bad points. \n\nI don't wanna be preachy but it's so fundamentally wrong to think that Christianity is just good points vs bad. Even the historical figure of Jesus didn't present it that way.",

            "comment": "I used to think it was magical or just a bit of fun until I started teaching. Every year come January the kids would come in and start talking (sometimes bragging) about what Santa had given them. Sometimes Santa was extremely generous to certain children, others unfortunately not so much. You could see some of the other children who were \"good\" thinking to themselves \"why didn't I get as much as everyone else?\" It was actually a little heartbreaking.\n\nEdit- Santa seems to be a really emotional subject still for a lot of people. My original comment was made quite casually.  I should clarify that I'm not suggesting we cancel Christmas. The issue I have is that we generally feed kids this idea that there is a godlike figure who will pass judgement on how good or bad you are, but then doesn't even follow his own rules, because he gave your bully more gifts than he gave you. I am not in denial that shitty things still happen to good people either. It's a big hot topic in schools right now to help children be resilient and we do that whenever opportunities arise.  But as adults we are in control of how we explain the mythology of Santa and set up whatever traditions we want to follow. Let's just be mindful and show a little empathy while we do so. At our house Santa gives one modest gift and fills your stocking, everything else is from family and friends. I really don't get people's logic that the wound is already there, so what's the harm in a little sprinkle of salt. Trust me, kids know early on where they all sit in the pecking order, all year round. They don't need the added salt.",

If we can find something that's large and fun and visibly impressive but pretty cheap (good example: those bop bags they can punch and throw around) then all the better.  \n\nI prefer the idea that Santa is fun and thoughtful and likes to surprise people to the idea that Santa has an unlimited budget and gets you exactly what you want.  I remember having the same flawed logic as a child that it didn't matter if we could afford it or not, what's money to Santa?",

I see tons of rich kids getting things like new computers, phones, etc, even if there are multiple children.\n\nI've also heard of children who are poor but the parents go to great lengths to get something good.\n\nWhereas most middle-class families including myself maybe get $150 worth of gifts combined for each child. Don't get me wrong, the amount of gifts we get is still lucky, and usually, it encompasses what I'm 'wishing' for each year. Otherwise, I try to save up until my birthday to buy something myself.\n\nFor instance, I needed to save up birthday money, Christmas money, and sold an old electronic of mine to buy the Oculus Quest 64gb.\n\nEDIT: You can stop calling me ungrateful even when I admitted I enjoyed it and thought $150 was lucky. I save up my own money when I buy anything else. I was hesitant to post this for that specific reason.",

I'll explain the CCJ below because Santa probably would have been better. \n\nThe Cosmic Christmas Jellyfish (CCJ for short) live deep below the ocean and sometimes comes out and flies in the sky leaving a colorful goo in his wake that some people mistake for the Northern Lights. He is a giant, colorful, magical flying jellyfish. \nTo receive presents on Christmas you must do as follows:\n1. Clean your room \n2. Leave a pistachio offering out for him \n3. Be asleep. \nIf all of those things are done he will eat the pistachios and poop out your presents. \nIf they are not, however, he will rip you limb from limb, eviscerate you, and leave your guts strewn about your room to be discovered in the morning. \nI had a weird childhood",

            "comment": "I think the biggest problem with telling young people there's no Santa is because kids have no filter.  When everyone at school is talking about Santa, they'll blurt out that Santa isn't real, and they'll crush all their classmates.  \n\nI read this once, and I saved it.  If I have kids, I think I'd like to do this.\n\n[The Secret of Santa](https://redtri.com/i-m-the-mom-behind-the-secret-of-santa/)\n\n&gt;In our family,\u00a0we have a special way of transitioning the kids from receiving from Santa, to becoming a Santa. This way, the Santa construct is not a lie that gets discovered, but an unfolding series of good deeds and Christmas spirit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When they are 8 or 9\u2014whenever you see that dawning suspicion that Santa may not be a material being\u2014 that means the child is ready.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I take them out \u201cfor coffee.\u201d We get a booth, order our drinks, and the following pronouncement is made:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cYou sure have grown an awful lot this year. Not only are you taller, but I can see that your heart has grown, too.\u201d I point out 2-3 examples of empathetic behavior, consideration of people\u2019s feelings, good deeds etc, the kid has done in the past year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIn fact, your heart has grown so much that\u00a0I think you are ready to become a Santa Claus. You probably have noticed that most of the Santas you see are people dressed up like him. Some of your friends might have even told you that there is no Santa.\u00a0 A lot of children think that, because they aren\u2019t ready to BE a Santa yet, but YOU ARE.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cTell me the best things about Santa. What does Santa get for all of his trouble?\" We work our way from \u201ccookies\u201d to the good feeling of having done something for someone else. \u201cWell, now YOU are ready to do your first job as a Santa!\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now for the fun part! Make sure you maintain the proper conspiratorial tone.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We then have the child choose someone they know\u2013a neighbor,\u00a0usually. The child\u2019s mission is to secretly, deviously, find out something that the person needs, and\u00a0then provide it, wrap it, deliver it\u2013and never, ever reveal to the target where it came from.\u00a0Being a Santa isn\u2019t about getting credit, you see. It\u2019s about unselfish giving.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My oldest chose the \u201cwitch lady\u201d on the corner. She really was horrible\u2013had a fence around the house and would never let the kids go in and get a stray ball or frisbee. She\u2019d even yell at them to play quieter. He noticed that she came out every morning to get her paper in bare feet, so he decided she needed slippers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;His next task was to go spy on her and decide how big her feet were. He\u00a0hid in the bushes one Saturday, and decided she wore a medium, so we went and bought warm slippers. He wrapped them up, and tagged it \u201cMerry Christmas from Santa.\u201d After dinner, he slipped down to her house, and slid the package under her driveway gate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next morning,\u00a0we watched as she waddled out to get the paper, picked up the present, and went inside. My son could hardly contain his excitement, and couldn\u2019t wait to see what would happen next. The next morning, as we drove off, there she was, out getting her paper\u2013wearing the slippers. He was ecstatic. I had to remind him that NO ONE could ever know what he did, or he wouldn\u2019t be a Santa.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Over the years, he chose a good number of targets, always coming up with a unique present just for them. One year he chose the daughter of some friends of ours, who were going through some tough times. Christmas for them was looking pretty bleak. With the help of his father, he polished up his bike, put a new seat on it, and with her parents\u2019 permission, placed it on their back porch. The look on her face when she saw the bike with a big bow on it was almost as good as the look on my son\u2019s face.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When it came time for Son #2 to join the ranks, my oldest came along, and helped with the induction speech. They are both excellent gifters, by the way, and never felt that they had been lied to\u2014because, instead, they were let in on the Secret of Being a Santa.\n\nAs my siblings and I got older, and my older brother and I knew Santa wasn't real while one or both of my younger sisters still did, my mom used to say \"as long as there's a spirit of love in the world, there's a Santa Claus.\"  What this lady did with her kids seems to demonstrate that in spades.  I think she successfully transitioned from the magic of Santa, to the magic of gifting selflessly. and she did so in such a way that the kid isn't going to tell his classmates that Santa doesn't exist.  Because Santa does exist, just within all of us.",

I'm not saying we should abandon it (for the most part it's a nice tradition and just a bit of fun for the little'uns at Christmas), but as others have pointed out it leaves some kids with awkward questions about why Santa likes little Timmy down the road more than them.  \n  \nSide note, when I was a kid we had both - we'd get some small \"stocking filler\" stuff from Father Christmas, but the \"main\" gifts would always be from our parents.",

Also, it is easier to convince a child that they should be grateful for a stranger gave to them, instead of their own parents. \"Maybe it's not what you wanted, but Santa delivers billions of presents to kids all over the world\" will hurt less than a kid finding out their parent doesn't even know what kind of toys they like, and buying them bad ones.   \n\n\nI think the experience of finding out that Santa isn't real is a good one. Parents + adults lie, is a good thing to teach to kids, especially if they employ their own reasoning skills to understand this.",

My family was pretty poor and dysfunctional but some of my happiest memories were of my older sisters and I decorating the tree, a real one that my dad had gone out into the forest and 'acquired'. We couldnt afford a fake perfect one. We would sit on a big old sheet, spread on the loungeroom floor, put on an album of carols and make tree decorations. Chains of coloured paper, twisted, folded and glued, strings of popcorn sprayed with silver, gold and red. Little coloured half blown up balloons painted with glue and sprinkled with glitter and folded aluminium foil, cut into lots of shapes, little hole at the top and cotton threaded through to hang on the branches. Grand total, maybe $10 dollars. Ive had expensive trees with fancy decorations but nothing was as magical as those trees at Christmas when I was young. Not expensive pressies but always wrapped and the whole family had a nice lunch. Mum's orders, no fighting at Christmas.",

The world can be a truly shitty place, so why not make it as magical as possible for your kids before reality sets in for them?\n\nI can only speak anecdotally, but I loved the whole Santa fantasy for my daughter. She would write him notes asking him questions, and I\u2019d trace over a work document on my iPad with a reply (I didn\u2019t want her to recognise my handwriting). On Christmas Eve, I\u2019d leave a glitter trail from the balcony door to her bed, and back to where the presents were (Santa\u2019s magic dust - he had to check she was asleep first, of course). I\u2019d eat the carrots she left out for the reindeer and leave chewed up bits behind at the balcony (because reindeer are messy eaters). I got into the whole fantasy way more than I ever expected, and she loved it. When she found out about him when she was eight, I was so sad. But for the last three Christmases (8-10), she\u2019s asked me if we can pretend that she doesn\u2019t know, so we can still do the same stuff. I\u2019m expecting the same this year. It makes me so happy to know that she loved it all so much.",

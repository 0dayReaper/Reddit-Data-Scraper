    "postText": "I, my fianc\u00e9 and our roommate are moving into a new apartment. They toured the apartment today and we all agree that it\u2019s the right location, size, and most importantly, the right price. The problem is that the current tenant is in \u201csome kind of hoarder situation\u201d according to my fianc\u00e9. Trash on every surface of the living room, and in the larger of two bedrooms there was trash all over the floor except for a cleared walkway to the bed. The apartment is a basement unit, so I\u2019m worried about the smell compounding with the already *earthy* smell of most basement apartments, and it\u2019s within 5 blocks of a large park, so I\u2019m also a little worried about bugs and rodents.\n\nWe are all fastidious people, the lease will have an overlap of just over a week with our old lease, and I am sure we will work together to get the place in order when we move. I\u2019m wondering what sorts of things we can do that maybe go beyond scrubbing counters and walls or vacuuming the carpet.\n\nI\u2019m already suggesting we ask for an itemized receipt for the cleaning, and I\u2019m thinking a visit from an exterminator is a good idea regardless of what we find. Any ideas are welcome though!",

If you get one room spotless, then you can store your stuff in there until you get the rest of the place done. If the current tennant is not an asshole, they will get their shit out of there. If you assume the worst, be ready with cleaning products and garbage bags.",

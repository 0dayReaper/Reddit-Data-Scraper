    "postText": "I've noticed that on a lot of socks now, especially some of the more designer ones, they have an L and R for which foot its supposed to go on. I always follow this and even switch them if I notice its not on the correct foot, but when I did it today it got me thinking. Is there really a difference? Is it just some marketing thing to make the socks seem more \"specialized\" or is there actually some science or design based on putting the same sock on the same foot all the time?",

Some socks are designed with just the right space for each set of toes on each foot, so if they were on the wrong way, the sock would be tight around your big toe and very loose around your pinky toe.",

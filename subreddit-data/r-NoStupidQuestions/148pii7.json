    "postText": "\nI was dating this guy and I really liked him. We had history with each other but it never blossomed because both of us ended up in relationships with other people.\nAnyways,I was showing him that I would be a good candidate for a girlfriend(cooking for him/supporting him when he was struggling in school etc.) After awhile he said I was coming on too strong,but at the same time he was telling me about the possible future we could have. we only had been dating for 1 1/2month, he claimed that he didn\u2019t want to get a relationship until a year from now. He claimed that he just wanted to \u201cget his shit together\u201d before getting in another relationship. (He only broke up with his ex a week before reconnecting with me).Well we ended up having sex and he started to point out a lot of my flaws and he said that I\u2019m too anxious and i overthink to much about what his intentions are. He told me he had that potential to be a master manipulator and a serial killer if he wanted to because of his intelligence. He would always tell me how kind and good he was as a person. However, I felt like he thought I wasn\u2019t a good person. I always felt like I had to perform for him and I would be extremely anxious and self conscious around him. He recently told me that he didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship anymore because we were on two different thinking planes and that he doesn\u2019t think we could connect spiritually and mentally(I\u2019m a Christian and he\u2019s not). He also said he feels like he\u2019s been trying to groom me to be what he wants. He says he doesn\u2019t deserve that.\n\nI just want to know you guy\u2019s opinion on this whole situation. \n\n\nDid he never like me and only want sex?( he claimed he\u2019s only had sex with two people in his life because he doesn\u2019t want to share energies with anybody) however he had sex with me 1 1/2 months into dating.\n\nHe\u2019s a nice guy from what I know. He was very considerate and was very observant of me. He was complimenting me a lot and how much he liked me and all of a sudden it stopped.",

    "postText": "Are there any games, tv shows or series, but mostly games where it is DURING the apocalypse and not POST apocalypse where everything is just a watselands with some thugs? For example I really loved the game last of us during the beginning part where the zombie onset starts and everyone runs for their lives (or the first 2 seasons of FTWD). It does not need to be zombies, could be weather disasters too or just WW3. I'm trying to get into this mood of ''the cities are not safe now try to find shelter among all the confusions'' type of stuff. Eeverything always seems to be post apocalyptic and not during the events and the big fall itself. So if anyone has suggestions for a game or tv show about that, let me know. Please dont suggest me something like Fallout games since I said I want something during the apocalypse (not some after stuff with wasteland and some thugs).",

One of the best movies ever made, IMO.",

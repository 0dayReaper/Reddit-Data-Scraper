Make sure to play up how embrassing and weird your attempts have been. And but at the end or if he hasn't already say.... \"Well... I've put more time into trying to figure out your name than I put into work/university. What is your name? Your like full name? Cause I'm not going through this again to figure out your surname.\"\n\nShould work. TL;DR...

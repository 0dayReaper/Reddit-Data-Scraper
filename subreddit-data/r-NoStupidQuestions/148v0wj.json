Even if they're *small* compared to those, they need to have the rights protected in order to compete. \"Right to work\" only protects corporate overlords, and lowers wages.   \n\n\nIt's mostly the death of unions, and the systematic dismantling of a unions right to negotiate your wages and workers rights.",

For instance, Jeff Bezos could probably still make billions with only 100 employees.\n\nThird, union busting, corporate control of the media, the death of a true left, and many other factors have shattered collective bargaining, so the power in negotiations has shifted towards employers",

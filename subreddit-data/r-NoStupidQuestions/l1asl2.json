For example if you give a synesthetic a page of thousands of O's but only one U they can spot the U almost immediately by color alone. Normies can't do it as fast.

Those tend to be the people who really just dip their toes into whatever top 40 comes on the radio. They may not have strong opinions about popular music but still indulge emotionally with other music in other ways, like singing hymns in church etc.\n\nOthers go out of their way to seek out and curate music that makes them feel a certain way. Some really get into the meaning of the lyrics, and some just listen for certain melodic or rhythmic or other tropes they tend to like. I think personally if you\u2019re listening properly and really trying to feel what emotion is being conveyed, and going out of your way to discover new or unheard music, you\u2019re doing it right. But that\u2019s just me; everyone is welcome and has the right to listen however they want to, however they feel like.\n\nI like to allow my favorite music to define moments in my life. For example, whenever I go to the beach I\u2019m usually bringing a speaker and playing my favorite tunes as loud as I can. Trying to boost the vibes and define that moment with those vibes. But often the person I\u2019m with will say something like \u201ccan we just turn off the music and listen to the ocean?\u201d And I\u2019m like ok what a bummer but, whatever. I guess it\u2019s just not the mood they were looking for in that moment.",

Now they always want me to play tunes because they say I\u2019m really good at picking and keeping a particular vibe going instead of having sporadic mood swings in the atmosphere. \n\n(As an extension I have like 20 long playlists for different vibes and might go through a few of them in a sitting as the environment\u2019s vibe changes. Makes it much better as there\u2019s no random skipping (which I\u2019ve found is the part which annoys people)).",

Because those songs will play, everywhere, for a few months, and occasionally beyond that, to remind you of that mindset. It's not a great time to discover new music either, especially when the themes are melancholy and the music is good. To this day, I think some of those albums I found were brilliant but hate how they make me feel anxious and hollow.",

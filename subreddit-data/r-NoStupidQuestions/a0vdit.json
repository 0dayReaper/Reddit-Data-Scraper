            "comment": "I worked at a company about 10 years ago where I was one of the few who knew how to run and transpose certain reports. I liked the company and was leaving for school and wanted to go back so I actually gave a month notice. I knew they'd have to hire someone and train them.\n\nThey found someone internal to take over for me in a couple of days so I spent a lot of time at their desk training them. Well, Wednesday of the next week my manager called me into the office to say they were letting me go because I was never at my desk and I wasn't doing my work (a lie).\n\nI filed unemployment. The company tried to fight it, saying I was let go for performance. However, a month before I had my annual review and had all high marks, and had never been in trouble.\n\nUnemployment found on my favor and the company ended up having to pay me unemployment for 6 months. Instead of just paying me for two extra weeks, they fucked themselves.\n",

You will never be able to work there again though. \n\nAnd this is the difference. Employers who are firing you will never want you to work for them again, so they will lose nothing by simply walking you out the door. They don't care if you're upset at them. \n\nIf you don't care about upsetting all of those people, go ahead and walk out. They'll never rehire you. If you go somewhere else and someone who you've upset by walking out is there, they may not hire you. \n\nIf a company is forced to lay you off because of a business change or downturn and they do wish to rehire you, they will give you at least 2 weeks notice and keep on good terms with you so that if business makes it possible for them to rehire you they can.

Well I ended up having to do it, did it, lady tiped me a couple bucks and then the store manager fired me right after, now no where in my job description does it say to help with groceries like that. And was pulled from what I was doing(moping bathrooms) to help bag groceries, I wouldn\u2019t want the janitor bagging my stuff I\u2019d bitch at the company about that. But I was in their union they had, even went to the headquarters a town over and talked to a union rep about how I was wrongfully fired and nothing was ever done for me, so in a way I agree with Kroger, some unions just take your money, Fuck grocery store unions. \n\nBigger unions like the one my dad was a rep for for his trucking company he worked for, he saved a lot of his coworkers asses/jobs.

There's a bunch of things you can do that aren't significant enough to justify firing the workforce but can get management to do what the workers want. Eg poster campaign, all wear same course shirts, all send letters asking for one thing, sing a union song at lunch, etc etc",

When one country falls to the corporate tyranny, it starts spreading it to all the countries with side offices. Keeping worker rights is a constant fight, because there is always that one psycho that wants to put everyone to a death march.\n\nUnfortunately, the unions really need big champions. Not just US, but especially the Asian countries. Working from 8am to 8pm Mon-Sat is the norm for many people there.",

It's just common decency as a human being to allow your colleague proper time to find a replacement, or find a job.  If your boss asked you to do something egregious, you would probably quit the next day; if you had a major fuck-up, you'd probably be fired the next day.

In the corporate world, like  /u/CasuallyCompetitive was describing, 2 weeks is the norm as well as severance packages.\n\nFor me, it's comes down to courtesy and relationships.  Every place I've left for a new job, I always gave at least 2 weeks in order to make the transition as smooth as possible for the people taking over my work because you never know when you may encounter these same people in the future, need a reference or even come back to the same company after a while (happens a lot more often than people think).\n\nVice versa for the company's side.  While not all corporations care, the good ones do and if, for example, they're eliminating a department or something like that, will give notice along with options for the workers (i.e. severance package or moving to an open position within the company).",

I had to call every day to see if they needed me to come in after school. After 2 or 3 weeks of calling and not working, I just stopped calling. I eventually got calls from them, but I never answered. A couple years later I needed another job, applied there, got an interview, told them what happened in that same store before, and still got the job. It probably varies from place to place or clothing store. ",

If you can schedule the job interview before the end of the month, then it is great, because that means the day your old guy walks out, a new guy walks in.\n\nThat is not always possible, so you then use the last month the employee is there to prepare for being a man down for 2 weeks or a month.",

Their priority is to their business, so giving you two weeks notice to be \u201cnice\u201d usually isn\u2019t on their radar. \n\nIt\u2019s also a big risk for the employer to give you advance notice of your firing. Employees often pretty much stop working after that conversation, do a poor job, or flat-out sabotage their work. They get angry and blow up at their supervisor or coworkers. They may try to get other employees to quit or act out in protest. In short, they become a wildcard, and that is usually too big of a potential problem for an employer to risk it. ",

Most employers don't have pension packages or anything like that, so there's not a good reason to stick around long term. 401ks can be transferred. You have to look out for yourself #1, just as businesses are looking out for themselves. If it's not financially or strategically prudent to keep you on staff, a company will let you go, often regardless of seniority. However, the reverse can be said as well. If you feel that a company is not fulfilling your financial or personal growth potential, you should look for an opportunity elsewhere. Don't wait for them to magically fulfill those things. \n\nI know it's easier said than done, though. It can be scary and high risk to leave a job. It's weird for me because my first two jobs in my career ended due to financial-related layoffs. But they ended up being the best things to happen to my career. In both cases, the next jobs I took paid substantially more. I'm not sure I'd be making as much as I am today if I hadn't been \"forced\" to leave a couple jobs. Had I not been laid off, who knows how long I would have stayed there, stunting my personal growth? What that tells me is that the time to leave a job (for me) is sooner than I think.",

Most employees in the states can get fired, or quit, at any time. \n\nIf you want to leave a company on good terms, 2 weeks is a courtesy you give your employee, it's by no means a requirement, again, for most jobs. However, the flip side to that is, if you want to go back to work at a company you previously quit with no notice, it's unlikely they will ever take you back. It's the same theory from the employers perspective, with the slight difference being that if they're firing you, they likely won't want you back anyway, so no additional notice is expected. If a company does temporary layoffs with the expectation of hiring an employee back, a 2+ week notice is generally given. ",

Whereas they want you to give them time to replace you so their company isn't impacted.\n\nThe whole situation is about the employer and not about the employee. \n\nHowever, its professional courtesy to give 2 weeks notice from an employee standpoint, if you should need your employer as a reference or they get called anyways, you would want to have left on the best of terms. \n\nPersonal story, and there is probably many of the opposite, this is just mine. I was in highschool and gave 2 weeks notice to my retail job, was happy to stay in work, help out etc. I was one of the best employees, all the managers knew me and I helped out through the whole store. Told my manager politely, thanked him, gave him my 2 weeks notice, he just got angry at me, told me to leave, wasn't needed anymore. \n\nStill happy I did it, I just remained more professional then him, a 15/16 yr old kid to a 40 something adult..",

In the case of redundancy it's longer again due to statutory consultancy periods, which can be around 4 weeks.  \n  \nIt's not that uncommon for some employees (particularly those who could be disruptive) to be offered \"garden leave\" rather than being asked to work their notice.  Depends on the role, though.",

The pool of employees is larger and less connected than the pool of employers.\n\nOn the flip side, itnis unlikely your employer can do too much to fuck up your life in 2 weeks between notice and you leaving. On the flip side, an angry employee with nothing to lose absolutely can fuck up a business if they want in 2 weeks. They can mess with files, piss off clients, sew discourd in the rest of the staff, etc. This makes offices more hesitant to give problem employees much warning.\n\nThat said i have been at plenty of jobs that did give notice when there was about to be layoffs, when a grant funded possition was ending, or when they knew of the firing in advance and had a good relationship with the employee.\n\nImmediate firings were most often (though not exclusivelyl a thing when the employee did something wrong and they want them out the door now.\n\nOn the flip side, if a job royally screws you you are well within your rights to walk out the door. You won't get a good reference, but you may not have wanted one in that situation anyway.",

I work on a contract which luckily has been extended twice, but each time, I've been left in the dark about whether it would be extended, and I didn't get official confirmation that I'd continue to have a job no more than one week before my contract would expire.

I'll let you know if I get an explanation. ",

These posts usually contain their age and gender in brackets... gives me the heebs.\n\nEDIT: well this blew up more than I thought, thank you all for engaging in this discussion, I appreciate all the comments made with some thought to them..I am attempting to read all your messages but may not get time to respond to you all.",

It was a full blown dick pic that was sized up to fill the entire email box from left to right so it was a very huge pic on the screen.... I never exited so fucking quick in my life. \n\nWhat's worse is that our pc is beside the TV/lounge area and my dad was laying on the sofa. Idk if he saw that or not, but I hope not lol",

We discussed things like sharing pictures etc. and talking to strangers. I grew up with the internet and learned not to do stupid shit. You NEVER should share any identifying content. ( only facebook would be allowed with fun pictures once I was 18+ ) And preferably you use a pseudonym name or something else rather than your real one whenever you get an account somewhere. \n\nA friend of mine didn\u2019t have a parent like that. She did some pretty weeirrddd shit. She got into contact with weird people. She\u2019s lucky she never got into any trouble. She would actually meet up with random strangers she talked to through chats on kids websites \n\nNow I see kids streaming and posting video\u2019s, pictures and stories of themselves and friends without parents even noticing. ( and sometimes grandparents/parents doing it for the attention they get which is even weirder ) \nI\u2019ve seen first hand what kind of weirdo\u2019s there are, and that was years ago, I don\u2019t want to know what lurks around these days.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the topics on here. Sex and the likes can be explained and talked through. But the influence strangers can have and the way content like pictures is shared is far more \u2018dangerous\u2019. \nThough I do think 10+ year olds need to learn how the internet works and how to treat it.\n\n*Edit : Year instead of your. And pseudonym instead of synonym, thanks kind redditor! That mistake snuck in without me realising. I\u2019m ashamed I didn\u2019t see it before posting.",

They're appealing when you're new to experimenting with drugs, which for a lot of people happens in high school. Once you're either over that phase, have used drugs long enough that it seems routine, or know all that you care to know about them, discussing drugs kind of loses its appeal.\n\nAlthough I don't really do drugs anymore (besides the occasional drink), by the time I was 20 I had tripped enough times to lose interest in experience reports,  smoked enough blunts that I didn't care to see any more pictures of them, and bought and sold enough to not want to hear any more about dealing or buying. \n\nI think they've always attracted a bunch of young people, it just seems to me that younger generations are becoming too comfortable with sharing an online and real-life identity, and not being careful to preserve any kind of anonymity or plausible deniability.",

Every little boy or girl knows that private parts are taboo, and taboo sparks curiousity.  A kid doesn't even have to know what sex _is_ to search for boobs or penises.\n\nYour options are to lock everything down and supervise your kids internet time, or to accept that they're going to see this stuff before they're ready, and build a relationship with your kid where they're not ashamed or embarrassed to ask questions about stuff they see online.\n\nHell, you can do both at the same time.  When I was a kid me and my dad would spend evenings browsing forums and watching fail videos.  We do the same thing with subreddits when I visit.\n\nTech is everywhere, and you can't fight the future.  All you can do is be a good parent and try to get out in front of it.",

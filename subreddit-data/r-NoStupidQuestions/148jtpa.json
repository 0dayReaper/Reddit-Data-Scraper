Orange creamsicle, etc.\n\n\nI think it has more to do with tradition. A major ice cream brand would need to introduce new flavors and see how they do. They won't do that bc it's a risk and they could lose money. They stick with chocolate caramel and praline and peanut butter swirl toffee crunch fudge marble cookie because they have data on it. It sells. Apple a la mode ice cream has no data. Grape berry ice cream has no data. I'd personally love a lemon curd, nectarine, or plum ice cream, but oh well.",

By mixing grape skin into the grape juice it allows the concoction to freeze to make ice cream. \n\nHe goes to back to her all jolly and, having fulfilled her request, she agrees to date him. \n\nBut just before they can enjoy their newfound relationship, her cat jumps up on the table and takes a bite of the grape flavored ice cream and DIES instantly. It turns out that the chemical makeup of grape flavored ice cream is super potent to animal. \n\nThey do not get together and instead the poor guy sends his findings to a government agency (CDC or some veterinary science group that can do something with the information) and there is a ban in place on any grape ice cream for the foreseeable future. The grape concoction is still used today for putting down animals because of how quick and painless it is.",

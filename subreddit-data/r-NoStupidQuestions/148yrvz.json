Hobbies are skiing, surfing, bird watching, car repair, wood working, sodoku, puzzles, collecting, soccer, basketball, reenactments, piano, any instrument. Something where you sit and stare at something is not a hobby my man. Learn how to Whittle and make figurines or paint a picture or build a birdhouse. Invent something, design something.\n\nThe idea is to dedicate yourself to doing something that will leave an impression on someone or something in the world. Leave behind things that someday someone will say \"This was his, he made this\" or \"he did this\" and be proud of it. Doesn't even matter if it's the shittiest bird house ever to exist, it is yours.",

I\u2019m sure there are other apps like that too.

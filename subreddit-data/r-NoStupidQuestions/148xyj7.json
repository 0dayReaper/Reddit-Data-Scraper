    "postText": "In today's age and time, I still do not understand the relevance of this practice. Even educated families still follow the tradition of dowry which has been rebranded as gifts, seer(gifts given after marriage), expect the girls family to share the marriage expenses(but do not want to share cost of engagement held at the girls place), etc.\n\nAnd if all this is not enough, the society expects the bride's family to also bear the childbirth expenses and again gift in gold for the newborn. \n\nIn previous generations this was understandable given the girls did not work. However, most men prefer to marry girls who are employed and yet demand money from the girls family in the name of traditions.\n\nWhy this double standards?",

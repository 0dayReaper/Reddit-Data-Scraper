    "postText": "I've heard that said before and I'm wondering if it can be true. I left an abusive relationship 3 years ago and I stayed single for the aftermath of that time. I wanted to work on my personal growth and make sure that I was really ready for a new relationship.\n\n About a year ago, I started seeing a man and I thought things would be different. The only way he's different than my ex is that he doesn't hit me. It's not a good relationship and I'm leaving him. After 4 failed relationships, I can say for sure that I'm done with them.\n\n I'm 40 years old and I think I'm just not cut out for them. I'm not perfect but I've been through enough of men thinking they can run my life to know what I will absolutely not tolerate. I'm not saying all men are the same. I'm saying all the ones I've met seem to have issues.\n\n Lack of motivation, laziness and just a general failure to grow up. I will admit that I'm getting older and I'm kinda set in my ways but I'm wondering if it's possible that I'm not cut out for relationships. Maybe some people aren't.",

If you prefer not to spend your time, energy, space, life in a romantic partnership, that\u2019s very much fine if it\u2019s fine for you :)",

My life is a lot less complicated when I'm single. \n\nThe reason I'm leaving this one is because he's controlling. Well he's trying and I'm not tolerating it. I also realized that I just want to be single and he won't accept that I want to break up. \n\nThe good news is that I have a friend coming to get me",

Being in those types of relationships skews your perception of what is normal or acceptable in a relationship, and greatly lowers your bar for what is good/deserves praise. That doesn't mean you're not cut out for relationships, it just means it will take a lot more work to consistently assess any relationship you're in for red flags or even just signs he may not be for you. That said, being happy and content with yourself/being alone is more crucial than any relationship and would be the first step even if you did want to someday get back into dating.",

One day I noticed the suggested tip on the receipt seemed weirdly high. (I'm in the US and I don't want to do an AMA on tipping) . I realized that tip suggestion was 15% of the entire bill, not 15% of my half of the bill. If I was someone who had let machines do *all* my math thinking for me, that's a mistake that might have slipped by me. That one incident wasn't the difference between financial stability and financial ruin, but stuff like that can add up over time.\n\nIt's important to be able to do some basic mental approximations so you can double check that what the machines are reporting seems reasonable.",

Plenty of exams have calculator sections.\n\nBut you should also be able to get a rough estimate mentally in order to confirm the answer on your calculator makes sense in case you made a mistake entertaining it. And if you show your work your teacher can see your thought process to make sure you understand how you got your answer, which might be harder if you do everything on a calculator.",

Being able to use the most basic functions of a calculator is useful, but I don't have any doubt all of my students can do that just fine.\n\nHowever, it is also important to manipulate basic arithmetic operations enough to be confident about how they work and relate to each others. This way you don't get lost when we start replacing the numbers by letters. And I have much more doubts about that for a lot of my students. I've had too many of them being so used to using a calculator, that they don't really know what it's all about anymore. To them, it's just symbols to enter. I've seen a 14 year old kid not being able to compute \"3 divived by 3\" without a calculator. How can that kid hope to recognize a problem from real life, put it into an equation, and then solve it? That's an extreme case, but even without going that far, a worrying number of students are not confident enough with how those operations work to properly reason on them once things get one step more abstract.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with calculators by themselves. But some practice with computing is required to assimilate what those operations mean and think about them properly.",

    "postText": "I saw an episode of unsolved mysteries where a guy fled before his trial (manslaughter) and went missing for years. The follow-up was that they found him years later working in a clothing store in Dublin. His trial was minor, wasn\u2019t national news, and not well-known, yet they just happened to catch him all this time later? \n\nThis is just one instance of something like this. I\u2019ve seen dozens of stories (not on unsolved mysteries) of people who committed crimes and were found decades later working in a bar in Argentina or something like that. How does that happen? Lol.",

            "comment": "It's a lot simpler than you're probably thinking. When people flee the country because they're criminals, they sometimes tell people after being there for years. They find a girlfriend, they get really close and they eventually tell them they're on the run from the law. Sometimes girlfriend tells, sometimes not. Other times a totally random person recognizes them. Other times a private citizen tracks them down. Sometimes it's ridiculously obvious where a person has fled and authorities just don't have resources or legal right to track them down. \n\nThere are plenty of international fugitives who are still missing.",

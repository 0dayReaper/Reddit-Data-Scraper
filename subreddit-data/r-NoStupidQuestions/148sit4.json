If the object and the flame are at the same temperature, they\u2019re in \u201cthermodynamic equilibrium\u201d and the object will not get any hotter. Adding more flame from another torch won\u2019t change that if the second flame is also the same temperature.",

So you're not really ever got to get to \"thermodynamics equilibrium\" with a chemical reactions in that way.  It's not like setting a hot object next to a cold one.  \n\nIt's more like calories in vs calories out.  The temperature will keep going up until they heat output equals the heat intake.",

Also, the longer you're doing that kind of work, the more desensitized to it you'll get.",

Maybe early exposure helps, maybe people just have natural tolerances to different things. Either way it can almost always be overcome with effort and experience if you really want to, that doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be easy though.",

            "comment": "Lawyer here.  \n\nYou refuse bail only if the person is a risk to others or a flight risk.  Donald Trump isn't going to personally harm anyone (ie: he isn't violent; and incarcerating him for what he might say is a 1A issue). Donald Trump isn't a huge flight risk (he's running for POTUS, all of his assets are here, and he's under constant surveillance by the media, law enforcement, and his own security).  Therefore, he's likely to get bail, and he has the money to post bail.\n\nThere is also the \"we live in a democracy\" issue that needs to be considered.  Trump is running for POTUS.  He is a serious candidate, and has held the office in the past.  You (and I) may not like him, but to incarcerate him without finding him guilty, while his political opponents suffer no such handicap, is a serious impediment to democracy.  Remember, he's innocent until proven guilty - which means his rights between now and any finding of guilt need to remain as uninfringed as possible.\n\nEdits: Typos corrected.",

Is the DoJ weaponized? I'm not sure I believe that, but a quick way to give this rhetorical credence would definitely be for the DoJ (led by a Merrick Garland scorned by the GOP/Trump) to jail the front-runner political rival of the current administration.\n\nIf he's guilty, let the trial occur and make moves after that. If they're confident, they'll let justice prevail and he'll be convicted.",

I assumed, sure; brainwashed as I am. \n\nHe\u2019s always been rich, and he\u2019s been POTUS. People need to get straight on what it takes for the US government to admit our shit stinks enough to federally indict a POTUS for the first time in our pristine strawberry-fart-smelling history. He obviously fucked his own pooch well enough for folks to globally admit a US President can do that. If it could have in any way been explained differently, our gov would have told that tale.\n\nThis is the point where I\u2019ve had at least a half a pint of Tito\u2019s but my alcoholism doesn\u2019t negate my country\u2019s sad state in acknowledging how badly we fucked up: Edit: this ex POTUS\u2019 criminal trial has been randomly assigned the same judge that subjugated herself in attempts to help him; she was summarily refused by the 11th and the investigation continued. \n\nNow she\u2019s back, ready to slow walk all of it unless Jack Smith planned for her possibility. He let it go to Trump\u2019s state of FL so I imagine he knew Aileen Cannon was a possible judge. That\u2019s how firm the evidence he has against Trump. Even Trump\u2019s own appointed judge can\u2019t negate the evidence. Despite her failed attempts last year. \n\nFor anyone thinking that our democracy is some kind of example\u2026 literally, the jury is still out, but of all the indictments of a POTUS, this is the one you could watch to find out if the USA is full of shit or not. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, he\u2019ll be judged by a jury of his peers in his state of FL and as the **GOP leader**, southern FL is the safest spot his lawyers (of the ones who haven\u2019t quit) will find the most corrupt and preferable outcome for their client in. \n\nIf the USA can\u2019t manage a decent jury in FL, just listen to the indictment while you\u2019re on the shitter sometimes and know that\u2019s where your national secrets were before your country decided to grow a pair and ask the elite turned potus if he really meant it when he said we\u2019re all safe from being fucked via the discovery of our secrets. \n\nWe\u2019re all concerned now because he lied and said our national secrets were safe and not in his hotel\u2019s shitter when they were. \n\nAudio of the indictment https://player.simplecast.com/9fe15942-f30e-4349-8f63-5501ba8c027e",

On August 23, 2018, Winner was convicted of \"removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet\" and sentenced to five years and three months in prison as part of a plea deal.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Winner)\n\nOr how about...\n\n&gt; [A federal appeals court on Monday denied a request by the former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to be released from jail on bail, and upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to hold Manning in civil contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/22/chelsea-manning-federal-appeals-court-rejects-release-bail)\n\nDo you want to go back further? We can look to one of the first people to get charged under the Espionage Act, Eugene Debs, [who certainly didn't seem to get bail either](https://www.newspapers.com/article/115358863/eugene-debs-in-jail/). And he was running for Congress at the same time, so the argument of \"well Trump certainly can't run for office from a foreign state\" is, at the very least, a shift in perspective.\n\nEdit: there seems to be a perception that these cases are exceptional? Which, to be fair, every Espionage Act case is exceptional\u2014it's a fairly rare charge, all told. That being said, what's even rarer is getting bail for it. [Aldrich Ames and his wife were both denied bail](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19940302&amp;slug=1898036), and so was [the wife of Jonathan Pollard, who sought refuge with the Israeli embassy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/12/10/judge-turns-down-bail-for-accused-spys-wife/434c0e6b-9834-495c-a491-dd5d741e2b62/), as well as [Larry Wu-Tai Chin, who was charged years after the fact and had remained in the US for his retirement](https://apnews.com/article/c013c09ddc69d5475ed3df00a81ad53a). Were these people flight risks? The US attorneys that prosecuted them certainly argued so! And to my knowledge they didn't argue it in this case with Trump, which is certainly exceptional as well, in its own way. \n\nIf you believe that these people were each uniquely flight risks, or that Trump is uniquely not a flight risk, then the outcome seems justified. But, if nothing else, it is very unusual. We'll see if Trump really is selling documents to the Saudis, or if he was just incompetent in handling keepsakes. Until the outcome of the case, however, it's helpful to keep in mind the history of such charges, and the weight that they usually carry.",

Eugene Debs was a presidential candidate who was charged under the Espionage Act and received bail. \"The airmen\" is Jack Texeira and we already mentioned why he would not receive bail. Anyone who could conceivably defect and has intelligence training is not going to be granted bail more than likely.",

I think it's not an impossibility that he would  \"schedule an overseas trip\" and not come back. Why does anybody believe he would be incapable of running away given the overwhelming evidence that he is a massive coward and completely willing to commit as many crimes as he sees fit?\n\nUnless they're going to make a former president of the United States surrender his passport, which would mean the justice department openly declaring they believe he will try to run, then this is not out of the realm of possibility.\n\n\"This is the greatest criminal hoax in the history of the world. And I will not give the Biden crime syndicate the pleasure of trying me in a fake kangaroo trial. The fake lawyer and very weak Jack Smith is a Democrat trying to destroy America. Until I am declared the legitimate winner of the 2020 and 2024 elections and all sham charges against me are dropped, and I've been very innocent and very honest about all of this, I will be staying here in Saudi Arabia.\"",

Some things that the judge considers are whether the defendant is a flight risk and whether he presents a risk of danger to the community.  They will confiscate Trump's passport - that's common practice.  Having practiced criminal defense law in both the state and federal systems, I would say that defendants are less likely to be held in custody pending trial in federal cases (unless they are accused of violent crimes) than they are in state cases.",

But it always ends the same. After they get to know me 1 or 2 dates later, they all (politely) dump me. Same with friends. Any that I am able to make slowly distance themselves from me after like a month. \n\nThe advice to do in these situations is always to learn to love yourself first and that will help. But how am I supposed to love myself when there is something so clearly and fundamentally wrong with my character that people want to run away from? How can I love myself when life has shown me time and time again that Im not even worthy to be loved by other people?",

Sometimes you feel like you are on top of the world and sometimes you feel like you are down the deepest hole.\nI do not know your personal experience, so I can only talk about my view. \nI think that everyone is compatible with someone (either on a friendship level or more), even though they might not have met those people yet. Maybe that's your case.\nLoving yourself is a long process and it's hard not to seek for validation all the time. I think that it gets easier every time a small attitude becomes a habit. Maybe it's looking yourself in the mirror and telling yourself you love your smile or other features, or maybe it's writing about some nice or genuine act you made that day. Sometimes a simple walk in the park also helps. \nBeyond that, my advice is to be nice to others. I would say to try not to rush into a relationship, and instead, try to build a meaningful connection with someone. People life based on their life experiences, it takes a big effort to understand someone. \nTry to start small and not pressure yourself, making someone happy can lead to a beautiful friendship. For example, most people like to get told a good morning and you can always compliment someone on what they wear/something they have or about their personality.\nAlso therapy could help. Having an opinion from a capable third party can give you the insight you need.",

I\u2019m not talking about some psychopath lone wolf shit like online advice guys say, but at the end of day people aren\u2019t always there for you so you need to learn to love yourself and function on your own and anything after that is just a bonus.",

            "comment": "If this is truly happening with everyone, not just love interests but friends too, it's worth trying to figure out if there's some common issue driving everyone away. Are there people you can ask about it? Former good friends who have been distancing themselves? Try to do it in a way that emphasizes you really want to know the truth even if it sounds harsh so that you can work on yourself. Not everyone will give you an upfront answer so ask several people at least. \n\nTo me this sounds like you may just lack self awareness and are perhaps doing something that bothers people. For example, I have a coworker who's generally nice but talks over everyone and just never stops talking so nobody ever wants to be around her. I have a friend who I had to start being friends with in small doses because he's super confrontational and just turns every single interaction into some kind of debate in a way that's exhausting to be around, and most of our mutual friends are pretty done with him for that reason. Both of these people are great in some ways but are just so lacking in self awareness that they don't understand how these specific behaviors are driving everyone away. \n\nIf you can identify if there is some specific issue and address it, that could really improve your situation. This advice isn't *instead* of loving yourself, but it might be an important step in solving your problem.",

My first thought was, \u201cwho\u2019s gonna pay to have this fixed?\u201d\n\nAt first, I thought it would be her since she did indeed break it in an extreme way.  However, since obesity is recognized as a disability, she could argue that she attempted to use a stall for the disabled, and it was not up to par.  Thank goodness she wasn\u2019t hurt but, if she was, who would have the legal advantage?",

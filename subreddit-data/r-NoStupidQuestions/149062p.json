My brain does this automatically, all the time, sometimes with multiple overlapping tracks. Right now, it's two different songs, me writing this comment, and me wondering what I should eat for dinner.",

            "comment": "Yes, scientific studies have shown most people do have inner monologues. However, not everyone uses it all the time, and some people may have a more visual or non-verbal thinking process. Inner monologues can be pretty simple-stupid like: \u201cDid I turn off the oven? Yeah I definitely did\u201d or \u201cI don't know if I'm ready for this. What if I mess up? What if I make a fool of myself? Maybe I should just back out and avoid the whole thing altogether.\u201d It\u2019s a fairly wide net but if you hear a voice or your own voice it\u2019s your inner monologue.",

I deleted it immediately but there's the recently deleted bin on IG that still has it-- i can't delete it there because the person will be notified via mail. so i'm kind of panicking now because idk if the person will be notified via email that I posted something on the story (their ig acct has the professional settings/functions)\n\nwill they be notified?? or know abt it? otherwise, need to wait for 30 painful days for it to be deleted in the recently deleted folder, and pray that they won't check it. actually crying rn haha...",

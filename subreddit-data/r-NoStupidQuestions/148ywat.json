    "postText": "Zoomer here. I keep hearing old people (anyone born before 1990) talk about how great life was before social media and how everybody actually talked to each other and how relationships and connections were incredibly strong, whereas now everyone just sits in silence on their phones. And I honestly get it, we're really closed off these days, and I wish I wasn't too introverted to try to consistently break the norm. How did people keep in touch with each other? How often did they reach out? How often did they just talk on the landline versus make plans together? What was meeting new people like? I feel like I'm idealizing it a little, was life really more social back then? How would you suggest we get back to it?",

I had some who thought 30s was old people. :). \n\nAnyway. Landline phones were a thing and there honestly was less to by yourself so you find ways to hang out and get together. I remember a lot more hanging out with friends and coworkers after work or on weekends. Even in early to late 2000s.",

There was no such thing as being \"friends\" with people from high school or grade school like just in the background. You never saw them again. Now you have your entire class in your followers even if you don't talk to them you still know what they look like and who they turned out to be.",

All the same shit  people do now, but we planned more.\n\nAnd believe it or not, people used to talk to each other on telephones. Parents had to deal with a kid tying up the phone for hours listening to their girlfriend or boyfriend breathing. \n\nRelatives called each other out of the blue to catch up and share news .",

I remember reading that back in the 1800s in London for example, men and women would send each other messages via courier, and it was so fast that you could send several messages per day to the lady you loved (or were courting). Since at least the 1950s when everybody had a landline, our grandmas would be on the phone all day with their best pals or boyfriends.\n\nWhen I was a teenager back in the 1990s, we had this 'system' where you would write a note in a piece of paper, fold it very well and ask your neighbor to 'pass it' to the girl you wanted.",

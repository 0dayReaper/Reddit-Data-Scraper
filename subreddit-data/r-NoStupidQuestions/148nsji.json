But I get hit on frequently and that\u2019s not the issue here. What I have an issue with is men being abrasive in doing so or doing it in weird instances like parked at a red light.. even with a little one in the car\u2026 for why?  What is going on up there that you think \u201cI\u2019m just going to ask for her number real quick?\u201d Does this truly seem like the moment to \u2018shoot your shot\u2019 where do you see this going after asking? And conversely if I did give you my number doesn\u2019t that say something\u2026 off or questionable about me?   ANYWAY I\u2019m rambling. But I was trying to come up with a clever response in this situation to say to get men to be like \u201cah whoa okay nevermind I shouldn\u2019t be asking that\u201d  \n\nBut all I could think of were responses that make me look crazy and while I do ask this question with the intent of messing with someone I\u2019m not sure I want to make myself look bat shit crazy but I need recommendations on something ludicrous I could say that might work?",

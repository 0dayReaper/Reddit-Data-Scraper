Even in this extreme situation should you consider yourself lucky?",

It means if the wind had blown slightly differently one day, you likely would never have been born. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should be thankful all the time or that you should ignore hardships. I believe what he\u2019s saying here is to notice the unique position you hold. You are unlike anyone else and have the opportunity to live. It\u2019s about not being a passive bystander and taking moments to enjoy your life when you can.",

From an outside perspective it seems horrible. And it is. But that calf has nothing to compare its experience to. Some humans are born into the worst conditions imaginable, some are born into pure luxury. Lucky isn't really a term that describes their life experience. Instead it's more of an astronomical chance that that specific person is born. That being said, there isn't another person to say \"so glad it was this person born and not the other\".",

            "comment": "I mean you need to look at this from two different perspectives. Dawkins was speaking from the concept that life is inherently very difficult to create and we should be feel lucky we exist through this difficulty. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid to die because we were just lucky enough to live. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t saying that we should be happy about the experiences that make us unhappy in life just because we are born.",

While box offices / viewerships are typically still healthy for such  products, there is a noticeable increase in critical opinions of those same products, indicating that while such films or shows are being watched, they are being enjoyed less.",

They will eventually wane until the next cycle brings them back and they seem fresh and original.  The dark knight showed us how good a \"gritty\" superhero movie can be,  avengers showed us an epic light hearted blockbuster and how good that can be.  joker the antihero.  So anyways, theres varying trends within the genre but it is on the decline until people forget about them and a fresh take brings them back.  All this my opinion of course",

It's like expecting action movies or rom coms to fade away because it's been a few years since the last big one that rocked everyone's socks off. I think there's just a market for hero movies now the same as any other genre.",

I think it was Matt Damon critiquing that a movie like Good Will Hunting can't be made today.  Think about it: how many original movies have you seen, let alone heard about?  A movie that wasn't based on a book, a story, a previous franchise or other comic book?\n\nMaking a movie is expensive and risky.  The reason superhero movies and remakes are HUGELY popular is because they are safe investments.  The people watching movies today are the kids who grew up reading comic books 20-30 years ago.  These people are now the spenders whereas our parents aren't really going to movies anymore.  Not only that but the same people going to movies today now have kids of our own so we get to expose them to the characters we have grown to love.  Honestly, it's a Hollywood execs wet dream.  Between merchandising and ticket sales, as long as they can churn out a Marvel movie every year, they are printing money.\n\nNow compare that to a fresh, completely unknown movie.  Unless it's picked up by a streaming service, it isn't getting produced. Not only that, but it probably won't help your career.\n\nIt's also why we're in a golden age of television right now. Movies that would have been are being turned into TV shows, which are cheaper to produce and there seems to be an appetite for fresh content there.  But there are hints that execs are taking less risks here too.  Disney for example has picked up Ms. Marvel and Hawkeye as series, both in the Marvel Universe.  Amazon and Netflix, however, seem to be more bullish and willing to experiment with Jack Ryan and Space Force (among others).",

I miss fresh, original stories that really make you think.  They are becoming increasingly infrequent in Hollywood, but there are still interesting, novel stories being brought to life in international cinema.  The best films I saw last year were all foreign.\n\n*Another Round* directed by Thomas Vinterberg and starring Mads Mikkelsen, for example.  It won the Academy Award for best international film last year.  One of the best movies I\u2019ve seen in years, I highly recommend it.  Leo DiCaprio is already remaking it for some reason, but trust me you should just see the original Danish one.  Mads preforms a glorious and triumphant dance sequence at the end.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZcFFKS-Qk",

CG quality is all over the place and generally much worse than before. People go to cape movies for the spectacle so good special effects is a big selling point.",

I still keep up with the big superhero movies because they're a fun escape, but I've stopped going to the theater for them.  The quality has dipped, and worse they keep hitting the same notes over and over again.  You can see kernels of genuinely amazing stories, like Peter Parker trying to rehab a severely mentally-ill Green Goblin while grappling with his own failures to balance his life, that get completely lost in the studio-mandated CGIfest endings and the fan-service of throwing in as many cameos as possible.  \n\nI'm getting bored of it.\n\nMeanwhile I just binge watched 3 seasons of The Boys in a week, legitimately think Peacemaker might be the best new show of the year, and really enjoyed The Batman despite it's lengthy runtime and going into it with my own biases against it.  I'd also absolutely kill for a proper adaptation of the Immortal Hulk run, and am hyped for the new season of Harley Quinn.\n\nIt's not the superhero/comics genre I'm tired of.  It's the generic formula used in most of the crap being churned out for the marquee titles in the genre.  Marvel in particular keeps all it's projects on a tight leash even when they genuinely trying hard to be something different.",

Sony gets all the revenue from the solo Spiderman movies while Disney gets all the revenue from the other MCU movies that Spiderman appears in (Captain America, Avengers).  Marvel Studios is making all the movies and I presume the employee salaries are paid by either Sony or Disney depending on which is collecting the revenue for the film.",

The infamous scene from Black Widow is actually just bad studio lighting that doesn't look like the sunlight it's supposed to be. A lot of the newer shows and movies have been directed by people who don't have a ton of experience shooting for VFX. The producers and VFX supervisors from Marvel are supposed to fill in those experience gaps, but with the volume of work they're doing now, that doesn't always work out. Then post production is left trying to clean up the mess on a short deadline.",

Westerns were a major genre for so long that the era of Western movies was literally longer than the Western era it based itself on. It started in the 30s and didn't burn itself out until the 70s. And Westerns are a way less diverse genre than Superheros, where you have something like The Boys and something like Ms. Marvel, both within the same umbrella, yet otherwise basically nothing alike.",

Action movies are always a big draw for people and half the time the protagonists are superhuman anyway (or accomplishing superhuman feats). \n\nFor something like the MCU, the people that just want to watch some fun action get what they want on an individual movie basis. For people that want and follow larger interconnected storylines, they can catch each installment. So Marvel Studios / Disney are hitting several demographics at once. \n\nPlus most are family friendly so whether it's little Timmy or your great aunt Bertha taking the kids for an afternoon, it's easy to jump into and be entertained by the ride.",

Robin Hood, Sinbad, and Zorro to name a few. We even have fascinating villains like Dracula.\n\nHeroes have *always* existed and fascinated us. I wonder if the people \"fatigued\" dislike a hero they can't see themselves \"realistically\" becoming. And by that I mean they buy a gun or cheap replica sword and don some shitty \"armor\" and larp on the internet about how they're like John Wick or a samurai. Or they dislike heroes that don't emulate American police and/or military forces.\n\nCould also be they dislike the diversity representation in the MCU, which is quickly becoming one of the most diverse properties in Hollywood. Maybe they're fatigued by the lack of dominance of the White Cis Male Ultra-Macho Gunslinger. Where were these \"fatigue\" people back when Hollywood was dominated by the White Cis Male Gunslinger hero and his damsel in distress?",

For instance how many Robin Hood movies have we gotten already? How many WW2 movies? How many western movies? Don't get me wrong, I still love a lot of these movies yet I also feel they're blocking any chance for us to see other time periods. I want to see big budget movies set during the renaissance or pike and shot era of Europe. I want more movies set around the French Revolution and Napoleonic era. I want more movies set in ancient Roman and Greek times. \n\nHistory has so many damn fascinating eras and personalities that I would love to see on the big screen with an even bigger budget yet I'm not hopeful that we'll ever see many of them because the truth is it's a big risk for a studio to make a big-budget movie set in an era or around a person that most people today have never heard of or are only vaguely familiar with. Why take a chance on making a movie about Hannibal Barca that only history nerds will see when we can just make another Robin Hood movie?",

Pop music? Romance novels?\n\nFor every genre there are a ton of people who love them.\n\nEDIT: I keep getting the same response, so I\u2019m just going to answer it here. \u201cSports aren\u2019t predetermined, you don\u2019t know who\u2019ll win\u201d\n\nMy mum loves cricket. So let\u2019s look at that. Team A will send in a bowler. He\u2019ll throw the ball. Because of the rules of the sport, as well as the limitations of physics and human physiology, he\u2019ll throw it in one of half a dozen ways. The batsman will try to hit the ball. Once again, there are a limited number of ways to do that. Then he\u2019ll run between the stumps while the fielders try to catch the ball and get him out. Once they\u2019ve done that six times, they\u2019ll send in a different bowler. Once they\u2019ve done that 50 times, or gotten 10 batters out, Team B will bowl. \n\nAnd every single ball will look like that. \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a massive oversimplification!\u201d Yes it is. And so is \u201cthe hero will always win\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of cricket, and all I see is the same cycle of throw the ball, hit the ball, run done again and again and again. Every single ball is almost identical to the one before and the one after. And I wonder how can anyone enjoy this? But a cricket fan will see how each bowler bowls a little differently. Each batsman responds differently. Each fielder reacts differently. You\u2019ll see a world of fun and variation where I see only the repetition. \n\nI look at superhero movies and see that The Batman focused on the detective side, while Love and Thunder went cosmic, No Way Home lent heavily into nostalgia, and Multiverse of Madness embraced the weird! These were all very different movies to me, and the fact that they were all released close together doesn\u2019t effect how much a fan enjoys them. But someone like OP who obviously isn\u2019t a fan just sees the same powered individual fights a villain and saves the world formula repeated again and again. \n\nThis is true of *all* entertainment. Cop shows, Rom-Coms, music, books, sports, superheroes. Everything has its repetitive elements that make it seem boring to those who aren\u2019t fans. \n\nEDIT 2: formatting",

            "comment": "My glib answer is: your question is like asking why aren't audiences sick of action, science fiction, or romance movies yet.\n\nMy second glib answer is: your question is based on the current supply of *Marvel* superhero movies. The MCU is like 80% of the current superhero movie market right now; their next competitor, DC film universe, is far behind in success, clout, and how much attention people pay to them.\n\nMy more realistic answer is: people aren't sick of them because they're still fun and interesting. Obviously, everyone has a different threshold of just how much they consider superhero movies fun and interesting. I personally know friends who never jumped on the superhero movie train, so their threshold was zero movies. I myself remained highly excited all the way to the latest \"Thor: Love and Thunder\", which is the 29th movie of the MCU. I am still excited to see the new Marvel films.\n\nTo help you better find your answer, you should look into why the Western genre (e.g. \"3:10 to Yuma\", Clint Eastwood's \"A Fistful of Dollars\") went away. They were massive during the 70s and 80s but then eventually fell out of favor. Sooner or later, that same thing will happen to superhero films. A new genre will come along, and then in 2050 you'll be asking \"How are people not sick and tired of XYZ movies yet?\"",

I think westerns, by virtue of being set in basically the same time period with basically the same sets and technology are inherently more limited as a genre than \"superhero\" is. If you tried to set a western in modern New York or outer space you'd have to change so many elements that people generally identify as core to the western movie archetype that it would arguably become a different genre. Meanwhile you can set a superhero movie in any time, place, or culture and have wildly different movies that people may still find interesting.

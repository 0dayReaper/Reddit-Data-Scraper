You would be very much in the wrong to go knocking down trees in his yard. Revenge is often romanticized in literature and song, but it is seldom justified or sanctioned.",

At some point an intervention will help end this, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any and this is just dragging on for years.. I don\u2019t get the logic of how this hasn\u2019t escalated",

I'm not sure what they'd accomplish by trying to burn down Russia's house.   it's doubtful they could, really.   the country is physically and populationally &lt;-- should be a word &lt;-- ginormous.   \n3.   and, ofc, nukes.   why give them the excuse?    \n4.   there's actual \"rules\" about war Russia is not just ignoring them, they're deliberately committing every war crime there is, almost as a policy.    but that goes back to point 1.    \n5.  Ukraine actually is hitting a few of the targets they're \"legally\" permitted to hit.  military and strategic ones that don't involve civilians.  so there's that.",

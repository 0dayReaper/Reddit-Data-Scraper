You also have a high risk.\n\nWhat to do. File a report with the police with as much DOCUMENTATION as you can get. (a text messaging sequence where you  mention to him about the threat to kill and ask an explanation because you don't feel he should have. If he fails to claim he never said it, you have an admission by its lack.\n\nCan you move far far away?

Someone threatening to kill you is so far beyond a red flag no matter how it's said that it's really concerning that you don't immediately recognize it that way. To clarify, this is not to say you're doing anything wrong or scold you for not seeing it that way at first. Especially since you've been in abusive relationships and potentially grown up around your mom's abusive relationships, it's super normal that you would have a skewed perception of what is acceptable behavior in a relationship (often people with a long history of abuse will find themselves comparing their partner to past partners and thinking, \"well he's an improvement\" without realizing that he's still mistreating you). Abusers will also often be able to pick up on this and target people who have been abused before because they are able to get away with more.",

Everybody gotta make some experience somehow.\n\nI had a girlfriend who wanted my FB password. Afterall, \"if you don't have anything to hide, it won't be a problem\".\n\nBoys and girls, even if you don't have anything to hide from your partner, don't give them your passwords. \n\nIf you seeing somebody with *that* level of insecurity, either he/she calms down or you better get out of that relationship asap.",

You can absolutely find someone to trust and give your heart to. But do it at your own pace. And communicate clear, set boundaries about what you're comfortable with. And then give them reminders if needed. As much as I tried to keep that top of mind early on, not having been in the situation I wasn't always thinking about it from her perspective. Someone who truly cares about you won't be put off being asked to take things slow, or avoiding certain places or situations, or generally making you feel more comfortable and at ease.",

Always be as kind and gentle with yourself as you can. \n\nRemember every day that you are a good person who is very much worthy of love and respect.

It can also teach you various tricks that help with your communication with your friends/family so you don\u2019t become controlling. Also, being controlling often happens when the person is either insecure or has anxiety.

It\u2019s a lot easier maintain control over someone when they have no outside opinion and no one else they can turn to for help.

I\u2019m a parental abuse survivor and I\u2019ve taken family psychology courses, so I can personally recognize the signs, but I\u2019m in the minority. I believe that all required Heath courses should have a section on psychology and recognizing abuse. It\u2019s important to know the signs!",

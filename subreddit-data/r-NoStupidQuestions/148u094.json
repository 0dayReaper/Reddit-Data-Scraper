Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. \n\nOtherwise, welcome!   \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

If she's a good friend, she might let you roll play with her, pretending she's one you're too shy to approach.\n\nYou learn from doing. Sometimes you'll fall flat on your face, but take it as an experience you learn from, and get back on saddle and try again. It gets easier after every attempt.",

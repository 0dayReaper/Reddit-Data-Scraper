What usually happens is we do one or two takes of the full piece, then we hit spots where there was a mistake, starting at a spot that\u2019s easy to splice in and ending at a natural phrase point. We do that for any egregious mistakes that the recording engineers can\u2019t easily fix, then send it off to be mastered.",

The engineer runs up the previous, first take in ProTools, playing it through my headphones while I'm singing and recording a parallel, new track. The engineer then replaces the rough patch in the first take at a gap where it's not even perceptible. With passage of time, I now can't even I.D. where the cut was. Only did it on one song of the 10 that I recorded.",

Generally the 'main' vocal line is one take, however there's always studio trickery like overdubbing to create the best possible version.\n\nA lot of bands have the main vocalist do all the vox in studio but since that's almost impossible to replicate live, they'll have their guitarist or bass player or whatever do backing at concerts.",

Flies in the face as I\u2019d expect an artist to sing as well as they can and really shine but she often plays down her vocal talent to play the crowd and keep things interesting. It\u2019s usually only covers and classics that she\u2019ll try to maintain the integrity of the song.",

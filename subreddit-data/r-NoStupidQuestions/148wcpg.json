I found similar questions in other subs but those subs are blacked out today.\r  \n\r  \nBasically I have a family member in another country, and he wants to watch some home videos we made of major life events (birthdays, weddings, etc.). I have the DVDs but no DVD player. I want to take the videos off the DVDs and transfer them to my computer, then upload/send it so they can view it. These are all personal videos we recorded, nothing with commercial copyrights.\r  \n\r  \nI'm thinking about buying this external DVD reader to hook up to my desktop to read the disk: [Best Buy Link](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-8x-external-usb-double-layer-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/5852919.p?skuId=5852919&amp;extStoreId=125&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwp6CkBhB_EiwAlQVyxa3I0YPjCqkL1LreSCtZRyooqySF71njcc_As0SE7C8NIw5vJPWOvhoCjMUQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\r  \n\r  \nAnd then I was going to download Movavi or Handbrake to rip the videos into something like an mp4.\r  \nWould this process work? Or am I thinking about it the wrong way?\r  \n\r  \nThanks in advance for the advice!",

Unfortunately, questions about suicide are not allowed on NoStupidQuestions.  **Asking how to kill yourself is never allowed on Reddit.** Not even if you're 'writing a book'. Trying to get around this filter will get you banned.\n\n* If you are struggling with feelings of [depression](/r/depression), with [suicidal thoughts](http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/11151/CWST.pdf), or if you're just having a really tough time, **we encourage you to [talk to someone](https://www.imalive.org/) and ask for help**.    The national mental health and suicide hotline is `988` in the USA.  More comfortable with texting? Text `START` to `741-741` for the [Crisis Text Line](http://www.crisistextline.org/get-help-now/) Want to know what to expect when you call? [Check out this FAQ!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotline_faqs)\n* If you're asking because you want to help someone else or deal with the aftereffects of a loved one's suicide, try posting in /r/SuicideWatch. Not sure what to say? Check out [this handy guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/).\n* Interested in the psychology behind why people commit suicide or have intrusive thoughts? You can ask on /r/psychopathology.\n* If your question is only *related* to suicide (like wondering about suicide trends or the legality of euthanasia in different countries) you can try asking on /r/morbidquestions. Keep in mind that *questions about how to kill yourself are banned there* (like everywhere on Reddit)! You might also be interested in some common suicide FAQs, such as [Is having suicidal thoughts normal?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/search?q=suicidal+thoughts+normal&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), [Do animals commit suicide?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/search?q=animal+suicide&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and [How do suicide hotlines work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/search?q=suicide+hotline&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) (or check out the [hotline FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotline_faqs)).\n\nYour question has been removed pending review by a moderator.

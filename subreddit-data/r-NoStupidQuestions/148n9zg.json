    "postText": "If you are in a survival situation like a zombie apocalypse, famine, deserted island and you have lice. They suck your blood so you lose nutrients and energy. But if you eat them do you get that energy back or even do you gain energy from eating its body too. And if so where is that extra energy coming from cause eventually (on a scale i realise is far greater than possible on a single human body) that could become a sustainable net positive food source? Like I know it wouldn't sustain you and probably the energy of catching, chewing and digesting would cancel out any energy gain but still i need answers.",

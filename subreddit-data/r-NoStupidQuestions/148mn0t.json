    "postText": "This has happened a few times and I wanted to know if this is a common experience, so I thought asking random strangers on the internet is as good as a place as any. For a week or so I've been extremely constipated. Nothing helped me poop, not even caffeine which usually makes me run to the toilet. Earlier today I had to go in manually with a plastic glove and take out the hard stool. After that, everything else just came out. This was around 40 minutes ago and I still feel like I lost a pound or so and my body just isn't used to such quick weight loss. This is the longest I've had to recover from a large shit, has this happened to anyone else, or is it just me?",

            "comment": "March 19th 2010 I took the biggest and longest shit I have ever taken in my entire life. Now when I say biggest/longest I mean it was so fucking big it wrapped around the bowl. \n\nI unfortunately did not have a poop knife so I couldn\u2019t even flush it down the toilet. It took me a solid 30-40 mins to get it out of me. I was sweating buckets.\n\nAfter I finished I just sat on the toilet for another solid 20 mins catching my breathe and focused on my breathing. To this day I haven\u2019t taken a shit that big.\n\nThe reason why it was so big: I ended up getting a tooth infection and I was prescribed percocets for the pain until I could get to the dentist back home. I was about 4 hours away from home. So I was partying that week, drinking and eating garbage food. I kept taking Percs, and they make you constipated, which I didn\u2019t know at the time. I hadn\u2019t pooped in like 3 days maybe 4. Finally as I was on my way home on the bus it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to spend 2 hours holding in a shit on a bus packed full of people. As soon as we got to the terminal I sprinted down the stairs to the bathroom. \n\nGod it was such an awful experience. I\u2019ll never forget it. I remember looking into the bowl and being like \u201cWTF is that!\u201d I snapped a pic and sent it to the group chat but no one believed it was my shit. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s my poop story, I hope you enjoyed the Tales of the Percocet Poop Snake.\n\nEdit: \n\nHere\u2019s the Poop Knife story everyone was asking for if you haven\u2019t read it, it\u2019s a good read. \n\nThe poop knife story is not mine: https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/ke8skw/the_poop_knife/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1",

Although I have to apologize that you had to have such a monumental shit in a public restroom. I have a bidet at home so my asshole is very spoiled and having to poop in public now is like my worst nightmare. Also fyi for future reference, opiods are constipators. When I had major surgery a few years ago I had nurses bringing me stool softeners with my other meds round the clock for my 4 day hospital stay. And the longer I was there the more I was given. First poop after surgery when I got home wasn't very fun either!",

Because my knee was in bad shape, I couldn\u2019t use the regular toilet because it was too low, so they wheeled in something that looked like a wheelchair but had a basin in the seat. After about half an hour of torture, I finally pooped. Reader, it was the size, shape, and mass of a baseball. I heard it go \u201cthunk\u201d when it came out. I asked for more morphine afterwards, and when the nurse saw what I\u2019d left in that basin, she was very happy to give me more. \n\nI felt that one for a few days.",

            "comment": "So I was constipated this one time. So I went to the pharmacy to get some over the counter laxatives. I took those and three days later I was still constipated. Doctor time. I get prescribed something to soften the cement poop, and also the colonoscopy juice they give you for a colonoscopy to really flush it out. Now I\u2019ve had a colonoscopy before so I knew what to expect. Except it would turn out I didn\u2019t in this case.\n\nI take the cement poop softener and the first dose of the colonoscopy juice. And then I wait. After a while I could feel the turtle head of a cement dump wanted to come out but was stuck like a newborn lying sideways in the womb. At this point my eyes are watering and I realize I am in the midst of the most painful dump of my life. Or so I thought. Eventually, progress! I feel the turtle head of a cement dump coming out to play and then . . . plop. Just the head. The rest of the turtle  was still hibernating.\n\nSo now to give birth to this carcass of a cement turtle poop. And so I push, to the point where not just my eyes are watering but I\u2019m sweating and my nose starts running. I push so hard I  stop scrolling Reddit and put my phone down. And this is where I realized that my previous most painful dump a few minutes ago was actually only the second most painful dump of my life. And then, the carcass of the cement turtle poop leaves my bowels and joins it\u2019s head in the toilet bowl. I flush. Relief. Or so I thought.\n\nI go sit down in my study across the hallway to catch my breath. Happiness. Or so I thought. Suddenly, there is a huge growl in my bowels and I can feel I might need to go back to the toilet. As I get up I realize that I forgot about the colonoscopy juice so had to make haste across the corridor to the toilet where the diarrhea that was the turtle\u2019s ocean left my intestines in what was a never ending stream of humiliation. Luckily it was over quick enough. I wipe and turn around and am met with what looks roughly ten times worse than that toilet in the movie Trainspotting. I clean up the toilet, flush and move on. While running to the bathroom I didn\u2019t quite make it so there were some splatters on the wall and the floor. Cleanup time.\n\nSo I go downstairs to fetch some chemicals, water, mop and bucket and get to cleaning. Just as I finish Armageddon lets rip out of the bowels of my personal hell and I don\u2019t have enough time to drop my pants and turn around and the result was a toilet bowl that now looked 20 times worse than the Trainspotting toilet, and a tsunami of diarrhea down my leg and up the wall. I start trying to clean but wave three comes and I have to run to the other bathroom just to decorate it as delightfully as the first one. This is where I would normally choose to die but couldn\u2019t because both myself, two bathrooms and the hallway looked as if the guy(s) who made the Trainspotting toilet so dirty had let rip on a not insignificant part of the upstairs level of my house. \n\nSo I spent the rest of that Sunday doing a deep clean of myself and the mess I had made. All while reflecting that this was probably the most shitty Sunday of my life.\n\nOr so I think.",

Never again.\n\nI'm going to go against the grain here. If you too have IBS-C (as in, you are diagnosed and this happens routinely), you may need to avoid insoluble fiber in large quantities as it can cause an impaction. Fiber works great for occasional normal constipation but if you have an ongoing issue it can potentially cause more harm than good. YMMV.",

I'm gonna tell you specifically: **Psyllium husk powder** is, by far, the most effective food-grade fiber laxative on God's green Earth. \n\nBuy yourself a small bag on Amazon and, whenever constipation happens, mix a teaspoon of it into some peanut butter and make a sandwich. Or mix it into the sauce/gravy of your evening meal. It tastes pretty bad on its own, but it blends right in with most foods.\n\nUse it during your next emergency, or make a habit of adding it to your foods a couple times a week for prevention. It will not let you down.",

I tried everything--laxatives, suppositories, even, yes, trying to fish out the obstruction with gloved hands. Nothing worked, and it just made my ass hurt. I was desperate.\n\nFinally, at the suggestion of the pharmacist, I took some magnesium citrate, which, if you're unfamiliar, is what they give people to flush out their systems before colonoscopies. Fellas, it is some of the nastiest-tasting medicine on god's green earth. They try to hide it with fruit flavors and fizziness, but that just makes it worse. I was told, \"Drink half of it. If nothing's happened, drink the other half.\"\n\nThis was my first experience with mag citrate, so I had no idea how long it was supposed to take. I drank half. God help me, I drank half that bottle. I felt... weird, but nothing had actually *happened* yet. So I forced the other half of that foul-tasting human Drano down my throat. And then everything happened at once.\n\nFriend, I have never had a bowel movement like this before or since.\n\nI pooped out things I'd eaten that day. I pooped out things I'd eaten before this started. I pooped out things I'd eaten as a child. I pooped out things I had only *thought* about eating. I passed everything from rocks to muddy water. And it didn't stop. I was up and down for the next 24 hours or so. I had to send my partner to the store to get baby wipes and hemorrhoid cream because my ass cheeks were raw. You know how when you've got the stomach flu and you keep trying to puke even though there's nothing in it? Imagine that, but your ass.\n\nI'm fairly certain I lost ten pounds that night, and there was one point when I was terrified I might actually poop out a kidney. I began to worry that I was never going to *stop* pooping and that this was just my life now. I get exhausted just *thinking* about that experience.\n\nSo TLDR I promise you're not the only one this has happened to.",

The kind where one of your knees gets to bouncing a little without your say-so. They were NOT malleable. They were NOT log shaped. And they were NOT taking prisoners. I could tell from the outset that something was gonna tear if I pressed my luck. so I tried to clench a bit to reshape, to no avail. They had already stretched things to the point of burning like someone slapped a sunburn. I tried wadding up some TP and reaching back there to knock off the bit that was already out. Nothing. So I was left with 2 choices. 1) Drive myself to the ER sitting on this thing like I was trying to hatch an ostrich egg, and have some stranger stare me in the eye and get to scooping, or 2) push with everything I had and hope I didn't tear something so bad I bled out, or passed out from the pain. A tear was inevitable. I knew that going in. But I figured if I had to do the hospital trip I'd want to kill myself from shame anyway, so I might as well go for the gold at home. I took my shirt off, rolled up the bottom to an inch thick or so, and bit down on it. then I grabbed the tub with 1 hand and the trash can with the other. Bit hard and squeezed with everything I had. I was glad no one was home because I was SCREAMING. My vision started to tunnel and narrow to a point, and just when I thought I'd black out it finally breached and dropped in. Not even a thundering splash though. Which was a huge disappointment. But once it was out, oh boy did the rest of the evacuation feel amazing. My vision came back, my asshole burned like hell, there was blood on the TP, but I didnt care. I was smiling, and my eyes were rolling back in their sockets. it was heaven. I don't wish it on anyone, though. It was terrifying and glorious. \n\n\nI also had one where I think I had food poisoning because I was alternating sitting on the potty and flopping sideways in to the tub running a cold shower and still sweating bullets, but that was a whole different thing.",

This thing shot out of my asshole like a bullet and the next thing I knew my ears were ringing and my vision was fading to black. \n\nThankfully I recovered before I fully passed out, but it took a few hours for my asshole to feel normal again.",

I go to the bathroom, let out some ungodly noises and get a humongous hard as hell turd - halfway out.  It's literally just hanging down and won't break off. So my fat ass shaking around telling it to get the hell out and nothing.  Wrap my hand in toilet paper and pull. But it breaks off up close. So I still have a huge turd pushed out and its so large and hard it's hurting so bad.  I'm wobbling around the bathroom hoping movement will help while freaking out cause others should be coming in anytime. Nothing.  So I grab some more toilet paper, jam it up there, and rip that fucker out. The sigh I let out then. Took my butthole a while to recover.",

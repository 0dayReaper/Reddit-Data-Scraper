Starving yourself is never a good idea.\n\nEating at the same times every day, eating properly portioned meals and making certain to *carefully* indulge in your favorite snack every few days will help.\n\nAs will including even a small amount of physical exercise beyond your normal daily routine",

You will see them, but it will take a considerable amount of time.\n\nRegular, healthy weight loss is a game of patience and acceptance. When i was 340lbs, it was almost an entire calendar year before i saw *any* weight loss, and that was with me going to the gym every day for that year.\n\nIf you want to see 'quicker' results, incorporate 30 minutes *extra* exercise into your daily routine *or* try to increase your steps every few days by at least 1000 steps. The human body habituates to physical exertion very quickly, which means that even though those 10000 steps might leave you tired, your body *will not* exert itself any more than it *has to* to reach that goal",

            "comment": "The nutritionists where I live, literally people who have seen thousands of failed attempts at weight control have stated these cornerstones: 1) have set times for main meals and follow that schedule, 2) if you get hungry between meals, have a small, healthy snack and then resume the schedule, 3) eat slow enough that the mechanism telling you when you've had enough has time to activate, and 4) use portion control to create a small deficite.\n\nThey advise against fighting hunger, as that is exactly what ends up making you stuff your face later on (they actually use a term 'hunger debt - something you'll pay for with interest later on'). Hunger and feeling when you're full are healthy mechanisms and ignoring either is connected with yo-yo pattern weightgain and eating disorders.",

(3) The calories you burn with 10k steps is an estimate and may or may not be close to the actual amount of calories you burnt.\n\nIt seems to me that you hold those number in too high regards. Yes, they are helpful. But if you don't notice any weight loss after a month then clearly one of the three things I mentioned above is the problem.\n\nAnd the way you ask how many calories you can consume makes me think that you aim for that amount. I think it's better to find a healthy eating habit and afterwards, calculate how many calories you consume.\n\nAn example of bad eating habits is eating 1000 calories of \"good food\" and a 200g bag of chips, totalling ~2000 calories. Yes, you ate less than your TDEE. No, this eating pattern won't help you lose weight.",

    "postText": "***Assuming you don't live together, but I'll take married/living together answers too out of curiosity!\n\nI currently see my girlfriend about 1-3 times in the week, depending on a few factors. We go to the same church, so Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights for the youth group. Saturday I get lunch at her job (she's a waitress). And if I'm lucky either Sunday after church or another random day in the week we can hang out... I feel lately like it isn't enough... I know I'm *seeing* her multiple times, but at the youth group we're both serving in different areas and on Saturday it's only for like an hour, give or take. \n\nI know we both have things going on and need our own time, but I miss her and want to see her more too.",

            "comment": "Depends, but in general, we see each other on Friday evenings/the weekends. \n\nFriday evening, we both have soccer games (separate teams) at the same park, so we'll meet up afterwards and go out or hang out at one of our places. We have other games throughout the weekend too so we'll usually end up going to one of each others to watch the game. \n\nIf both of us aren't too busy we'll usually end up spending saturday or sunday together but we make sure to give each other space to do other things (see friends/family, errands/chores, etc) or to rest if needed. \n\nEvery now and then we'll spend a weekday evening together if it works out logistically (we live on opposite sides of town, I usually work close to where I live but sometimes I get scheduled to work on the other side of town - so for those days it makes sense for me to stay at his place the night before to avoid a long commute in the morning). \n\nFor me personally, as much as I love seeing him, I'm also an introvert whose social battery is pretty small, and I need space to myself to maintain my mental health. He's understanding of that, thankfully. \n\nFor your situation, I'd just communicate your feelings to your partner (assuming you haven't already) and see what they say. I'd avoid pressuring them into spending more time together if they feel like they're already stretched for time, as it could strain your relationship. I'd recommend making time for phone calls if possible, I know it's not the same as seeing them in person, but I think it helps. \n\nAlso, if it ends up being a situation where there's nothing yall can do to see each other more I'd consider maybe taking up a new hobby, reaching out to friends, or spending more time doing things on your own. I spent alot of time single before meeting my partner and began to feel okay doing things on my own, I feel like that skill helps me now in avoiding codependency and helps during periods where we don't get to see each other as much.\n\nSorry for the long reply lol",

I figured out once that in a normal week we\u2019d have potentially 27 hours when we were both home, likely to both be awake, and might possibly be in the same room. That\u2019s of course not counting that we might have to do errands separately.",

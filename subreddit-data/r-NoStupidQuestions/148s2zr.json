    "postText": "I\u2019m very overweight (about 200-210lbs, 5\u20194) and actively trying to lose weight. However, I feel like I can\u2019t get the ball rolling, so to speak. I\u2019ve been going to the gym most mornings for a few weeks, but I\u2019m not able to do more than walking and after a while, I feel like I hit a wall and am not able to walk anymore, and I feel like it\u2019s preventing me from making any progress. My legs just cramp up and I feel like I can\u2019t move at all. I feel like if I could just lose like 10-15 pounds, I could make more progress in the gym, but I don\u2019t know how to lose those first few pounds. Any advice would be very appreciated.",

Don't be afraid to go one day on, one day off while your muscles adjust. Better to miss a day to soreness than a week to injury.\n\nThe rest of it is diet. Keep track of what you're eating for a week, particularly the calories. That way you've got some idea of how many calories you're eating in a day. If you're like most people, it's more than you think.\n\nNow take 10% off that number (to start). That's your limit now. Here's where you start making choices on what to eat and where to shave some calories. Might be as easy as switching a soda for an iced tea. This is where an app like MyFitnessPal can be helpful.\n\nLather, rinse, repeat. As time goes on, lower your limit, start paying attention to the rest of the label (cut sugar, increase protein, etc). 1 to 2 pounds a week is a good pace.",

Give yourself a cheat day.\n\nLess sugar, less salt, less soda, chips etc. You don't need to go cold turkey. Just eat less of junk. Look into getting \"Mrs Dash\" it's a flavourful replacement for salt.\n\nTake the stairs instead of the escalator/elevator.\n\nEach day, go for a little walk\n\nWhen you have to clean at home, put on some music and dance as you clean\n\nOn youtube they have dance exercise videos done to specific decades of music. So you can exercise to 80s music, 90s...60s..etc. It's just a fun 20 minutes...no push ups,  no heavy weights...just moving your body and having fun. Maybe give one of those a try.\n\nYou do stuff like this, the weight will slowly start to drop off.  Good luck.",

            "comment": "I'd say start with what you can at first. I agree that weight is lost in the kitchen, but I don't think that means you have to cut out everything and start \"dieting\". I put that in parenthesis because extreme diets can cause you to temporarily lose weight but once you get tired of it, you go right back, or worse, you start eating healthy and then \"binge\" or \"cheat\" because you held yourself to an unobtainable goal and then feel stressed and guilty about it and feel like all your progress has been reset. The cycle is horrible. I know someone who used to \"fast\" by not eating for two days and  then eating again. Eating disorders are way too common and they're so dangerous for you mentally and physically. My rule is to try and be as sustainable as possible. I started my adding salad to my lunch and dinner(or vegetables, broccoli, cucumber etc.) And fruits to my breakfasts and eating sweet fruit when i crave sugar. Dark choclate is something i also occasionally enjoy eating.The main thing is to find healthy food that you enjoy eating. You should never have to force something you find gross down just to lose a couple of pounds, or see every food in a negative light. I also don't think you have to completely cut out sugar, but that depends on your genetics and personal health. My advice is to change things up in your diet and replace the unhealthier things and eat healthy meals you genuinely enjoy. For example if you're a hardcore soda drinker, reduce your intake and eventually replace soda with an iced tea that doesn't have nearly as much sugar. Try and eat things that give you the same satisfaction, that are healthy, that still fill you up and dont leave you hungry half an hour later. The idea isn't to not eat, it's too eat healthy for a healthier lifestyle and life. Keep low impact exercises for now, a little bit will turn into more. If it helps, try low or no impact excersises that don't require you to be on your feet. There will be many times you will have to push yourself, but remember to take care of yourself. \nMake sure you're getting quality sleep, and don't stress, believe it or not it's one of the worst things for you. Drink water, make changes where you need to and don't overdo it. \nI hope this helps in some way! Stay safe! And good luck :)",

That's not a huge intense workout that you have to psych yourself up for but if you're taking transit everywhere you're likely going to have to walk a few blocks on either end to get to/from the station, now multiply that by every trip you take every day. Do that with any other things you can work into your daily life. Small routine things will have a bigger impact over time than big pushes when you're motivated that you end up dropping on your less motivated weeks.",

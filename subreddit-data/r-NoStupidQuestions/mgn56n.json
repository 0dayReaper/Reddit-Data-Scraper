Trying to create your own website. HTML, CSS, PHP, CMS, who has time for that? That's why you need Squarespace. Squarespace is the easy way to create your very own professional website using simple drag and drop actions, no matter if you're trying to open a digital storefront or finally starting that travel blog you were always talking about. The home page of the Notre Dame most likely wasn't made using Squarespace, but if it was, they could update it to reflect the tragic events on Monday, the 15th of April, with just a few clicks. If you want to give Squarespace a try, they are currently offering a special promo where you can get your own website, AND your very own domain for a free trial month by registering using the promo code squarespace.com/notre.\n\nThat's squarespace.com/notre\n\nHoney is a free browser add-on available on Google, Oprah, Firefox, Safari, if it's a browser it has Honey. All you have to do is when you're checking out on one of these major sites, just click that little orange button, and it will scan the entire internet and find discount codes for you. As you see right here, I'm on Hanes, y'know, ordering some shirts because who doesn't like ordering shirts; We saved 11 dollars! Dude our total is 55 dollars, and after Honey, it's 44 dollars. Boom. I clicked once and I saved 11 dollars. There's literally no reason not to install Honey. It takes two clicks, 10 million people use it, 100,000 five star reviews, unless you hate money, you should install Honey.\n\nSituations like this are why I use Audible. Audible is a subscription service that allows you to buy audiobooks that you can listen to on your phone. Audible allows you to choose from a gigantic array of audiobooks narrated by amazing narrators, that you can listen to from anywhere! Right now I'm listening to The Dead Zone by Stephen King, narrated by Oscar winning actor James Franco. It's the chilling story of a highschool teacher who falls into a coma and wakes up with psychic abilities. In all seriousness, audibooks are great for when you're alone, and I should maybe stop with the YouTube.\n\nSpeaking of skills, let me take a few minutes to talk to you about a website called Skillshare. Have you ever wanted to learn how to do something out of the ordinary or interesting? Well you can, by taking classes online at skillshare.com, which are taught by instructors and have their own class rosters. Heck, I learned how to juggle and make a PB&amp;J sandwich the RIGHT way, by using Skillshare. So what are you waiting around for? There are DOZENS of online courses that you can take ranging from Physics, all the way to fingerpainting!

Not sure why they think my doc won't just roll his eyes at me if I ever suggested that Singulair would be a better treatment than Xyzal for my seasonal allergies but I digress.",

That's because the whole thing was wax, with a homeopathic level of other stuff in it that maybe, possibly, in some studies, be remotely related to doing something that might not be the opposite of treating headaches.  \n\nFrom Wikipedia:  \n\n&gt; As of September 2000, there were two versions of HeadOn available in markets/stores: ExtraStrength and Migraine. Chemical analysis of the Migraine formulation has shown that the product consists almost entirely of\u00a0wax. The three \"active ingredients\" are\u00a0iris versicolor\u00a012X,\u00a0white bryony\u00a012X, and\u00a0potassium dichromate\u00a06X. The\u00a0\"X\" notation\u00a0indicates that the three chemicals have been diluted to 1\u00a0part per trillion, 1 part per trillion, and 1 part per million respectively.[12]\u00a0This amount of dilution is so great that the product has been described as a\u00a0placebo;[13]\u00a0with skeptic\u00a0James Randi\u00a0calling it a \"major medical swindle\".[12]\u00a0The formula for the Extra Strength version of the product is the same as the Migraine except that it excludes the iris versicolor.\n\n\nThe [ingredients section](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeadOn#:~:text=The%20three%20%22active%20ingredients%22%20are,12X%2C%20and%20potassium%20dichromate%206X.) goes into further detail, but it's basically more of the same.  \n\nThey put a candle in a gluestick applicator and convinced you to rub it on your face.",

One box had my dog's all-time favorite toy (I still keep it on display next to her urn) but most of it was cheap easily-destroyed toys (or toys too small to be safe for a large dog) and treats I couldn't use because of her sensitive stomach. Great idea in concept (and I'm a good target demographic as someone who's terrible with money and constantly buys unnecessary shit), but I cancelled it at the end of the discount period and didn't miss it.

I love *90 Day Fiance* and might watch some of their spinoffs if there's a couple I'm particularly interested in following, but I'd just like to get through one episode without seeing *Dr. Pimple Popper* every single commercial break.\n* VPNs in general. I understand online privacy is important and they've been promoted by a lot of people I trust, but I don't understand why a VPN itself is necessary on top of all the other measures we'd normally take to stay safe online. I'm also put off by the way they advertise it since accessing region-blocked content seems to be a big selling point. Give me an extra layer of security and that's fine, but telling me all about how I can trick Netflix into thinking I live in a different country makes your product look unnecessarily shady. I mean, car dealers wouldn't talk about how you can use all their cool compartments to stash drugs or weapons.\n* Those meditation commercials by Headspace. Nothing against it, just pure overexposure.\n* Basically any service advertising fitness or romantic advice, since they tend to be really long (multi-minute) ads that drag on. You can skip them, sure, but I like to just pop in a playlist and zone out, just letting the 10 and 15 second ads go by naturally. I really hate it when the flow of my game/work is interrupted by having to skip the ad, no matter how easy it is. It's like this: having to pay a penny for something that was previously free is worse than having to pay $2 for something that was $1. Going from nothing to something is always an infinitely large increase, no matter how objectively tiny the burden is.\n* GrubHub. You know the ad I'm talking about.\n* (law students) Barbri Bar Review. I swear ever since I started law school every other ad I see on YouTube is for bar prep services, and not even multiple brands. *Just* Barbri. It's bad since I'm a 1L, and I won't even take the bar for another 2.5 years. I am doomed to see literally thousands of these ads before I even start studying.",

They make you wait to skip or design that fucking x so damn small that you \"accidentally\" click on the ad anyway, it's fucking disingenuous and crooked. They're grooming children to get used to buying shit they don't need so when they become adults it'll be second-nature.\n\n\nSure, ads make the company money, but maybe, just maybe, if your company *lives* off of ad revenue then maybe it shouldn't survive. Ads used to be about companies providing a service to solve a problem *and here's where to find us, etc.*, not anymore, now it's every youtube video (including first aid videos for fuck's sake), every shopping site, convenience app, etc. This is turning into *Idiocracy* levels of advertising. Brought to you by Carl's Junior...\n\n\nI don't mind companies making profit in the same way that I don't mind fighters making money off uppercuts and roundhouse kicks, but at least with fighting you can't use weighted gloves, certain attacks, and there's a goddamned referee to determine what rules to follow and when enough is enough, these fuck's have free reign.",

They have the most jarring yet catchy jingles. If someone says \"mattress\", you think \"Canon\". That is why literally today I got a new mattress. What brand is it? Canon's direct competition. Because fuck you Canon. \n\nThen there is this billboard near my home. It is very clearly a cheap advert, with a famous journalist posing next to the owner of a company, who's giving the camera a hilariously bad side eye and smile look, while posing with a sample of plexiglass in between them. \n\nI run past that last billboard every day. It is so bad it pisses me off. The photo is very clearly a cellphone picture, not even taken with a pro camera, and it took me a week of either driving or jogging past that fucking sign to see the plexiglass in the first place. For a week, it felt like the woman paid for a billboard to say \"hey. I hang out with the guy from the news!\". It is the \"The Room\" of billboards. \n\nThat said... If I ever need a plexiglass window, I'll probably call them. Their advertising is absolute garbage, but it is so bad that I can't help but remember it.\n\nEdit: I seem to have misspelled the mattress company. Given that it is mostly known for their radio jingles, [especially this one](https://youtu.be/G7KoqlswncI), I typed it phonetically, and that was an incorrect spelling. My apologies. I also want to clarify that Cannon*, the mattress company, has absolutely nothing to do with Canon, the camera and photography equipment brand.",

I'd be willing to bet there's been much ink spilled regarding how advertisers can get as close as possible to this threshold without crossing it. (I'm imagining a graph with advertising quantity on the x axis and advertising effectiveness on the y axis, the y value steadily increasing as x increases, and then all of a sudden dropping off a cliff).\n\nAnyway, I do the exact same thing. I like to think of myself as a relatively informed consumer, but I'll still catch myself, before I do my research, kinda knee-jerk \"defaulting\" to a brand I've seen in advertisements (say what you will about marketing fucks, the shit works)... but if I feel like I've been \"bombarded\" with your ads, I will go out of my way to avoid your product.\n\nSimilarly, if you send me one of those \"we noticed you were browsing this particular item on our site for 10 seconds, you should come back and buy it\" emails (looking at you Home Depot), fuck you very much. Does anybody know what these are called (I'm not talking about abandoned cart emails)? What kind of inbred sociopath ever thought those were a good idea? (Though I guess they must work on some people, right?). There's a very, *very*, special place in Hell for whoever came up with this sales tactic, and a slightly lesser (but still special) place in Hell for whoever uses it. Send me one of those and I will do my best to *never* buy anything from you again (sadly in the case of Home Depot this isn't 100% practical), and at the very least I'll buy that particular product (if I was going to do so at all) somewhere else.",

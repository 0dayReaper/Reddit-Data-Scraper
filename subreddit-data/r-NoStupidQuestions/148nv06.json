Combine that with a warmer Earth without ice caps and you get large areas underwater. Places with oil, gas and coal often belong to this type - the carbon deposits come from sediment that fell to the bottom of the ocean, which is why it's called sedimentary rock.\n\nMeanwhile, places that have gold, iron and other minerals tend to be from the middle of the earth, pushed up - lots of metal, but little if any fuel. Those are called igneous rock, after the magma in the center of the earth.",

    "postText": "I used to read constantly. 12 hours a day for about a year. Then I burned out and quit reading entirely. This was maybe about 5 years ago that I started reading. I did it to distract myself from my thoughts, which won't shut up. - And I used to read every single comment on a bigger post on the major subs (up until maybe 150 comments). Now? Not so much. - And I'm a Marvel fan too. And I can barely retain my attention after about 5 or 6 issues. After that, I have to take a break for at least an hour. I'm 32 and have never been Ike this til about 2 tears ago. - And in case you're wondering, I don't watch TikTok vids. I used to he able to watch longer YT vids, but now anything over 10 minutes seems too long. And when I play a racing game on my phone, I kinda space out after a few races and go on autopilot.\n\nI feel like I'm losing my focus. And my sleeping schedule is very messed up. Like I'll be awake for 35 or more hours then I'll sleep a lot, like 12 hours or more. Also, I don't care too much about my typos that much either. I used to always correct my mistyping if I saw it. (And I've even made the \"there/their\" mistake once or twice.) I feel like my mind is slipping. I *am* diagnosed with a psychiatric condition, bit it feels its worsening rapidly. And I'm too scared to tell them because I know they won't believe me. I feel like my mind is slowly shattering and coming undone. I'm very emotionally sensitive and I think I've acquired misophonia. People screaming can put me in so much agony that I begin to get upset myself if they keep up with it.\n\nWhat's wrong with me?",

It'll take about 5 pages to get interested enough to keep going, but by then I've quit. And I used to read books that were super long, like Tom Clancy. I've never even finished the last book of his I started to read even tho I was interested. And jt took me maybe 3 months to read 200 pages. (Every now and then.) And I used to be addicted to reading. Like I'd get a headache if I didn't read that day. Being serious on the last part too.",

It doesn't need to be tiktok. That's terrible, but most social media is made to make you keep scrolling, keep engaging, keep tapping. \n\nTry limiting your phone or any social media (or youtube) use to an hour a day.",

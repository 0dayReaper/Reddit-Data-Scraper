    "postText": "I went on a date with a guy three weeks ago and I thought it went great. He's a photographer who does mostly boudoir and pinup photography. He said at the end he had a good time and wanted to be friends before pursuing anything more serious because a date was just an introduction and didn't mean anything romantically to him.\n\nI thought for our second date, I'd book him for boudoir photos. I thought it was something spicy that might ignite something in him. Our session was a few days ago and I found him very rude during it.\n\nI figured it would be a casual thing, do some poses, undress a little, and chat, but he kept on his camera mostly and kept directing me in poses that he wanted, not ones I wanted. If I tried to go a little further and suggest dropping my bottoms he said he's not interested in that. We still got some sexy photos but nothing really encroaching on explicit like I'd have wanted.\n\nAt the end, I asked him what he does with the photos, if he'll keep mine to look at, and he said it's \"not worth the space, so he'll delete them when he's done editing them\". Honestly it felt like a slap in the face. I didn't expect him to say he'll have Jerk Fest 3000 with them, but as a sexy memento, you know?\n\nHe told me he didn't want to see me anymore and I just don't get it at all. Maybe I'm socially stupid or something, can someone tell me what I did wrong here? I feel dumb spending $200 to try to seduce him and it did nothing but drive him away.\n\nETA: the session was a few days ago, but I got the photos yesterday, alongside his message of breaking up.",

In addition, your response to him saying he wanted to start things off on a platonic basis was to try to get naked in front of him. He may have taken that as a red flag for not respecting boundaries.",

Imagine you\u2019re him, and somebody you\u2019ve met only once and expressed interest in only as a friend turned up to your place of work and started asking if you wanted them to take off their clothes. It probably wouldn\u2019t go down super well, right?\n\nAside from his personal feelings, he also does this for a living and this is his profession. He didn\u2019t really know you and surely wouldn\u2019t be willing to put his reputation as a photographer on the line because somebody he met once was trying to get him to take more explicit photographs. Especially in boudoir photography, it\u2019s really important that models feel confident and safe with their photographer. Risking any sort of negative review from somebody who says they were encouraged to completely undress past what the photography session was initially booked as could be extremely damaging to his career, regardless as to whether this was somebody he was seeing romantically or not. It\u2019s still in his professional space and you still booked him as a professional, so he still needs to act like a professional.",

The story reeks of desperation and immaturity.\n\nYou absolutely *do not* schedule a second date as a business transaction with the person's secretary.  And then go try to tease them and strip for them in their workplace?  That is some crazy rom-com nonsense at best.\n\nBack in the day, we would've called that boil-a-bunny crazy; psychotically obsessed, stalkery.\n\nI know times have changed, but they haven't changed *that* much.\n\nAnd I know, in my case we took it really slow and easy and a lot of people would go much faster and harder.  But not *that* fast and hard.  Especially if your date said that they considered the first date as an introduction.  They might be willing to get to know you better, but not if you do stuff like that.\n\nETA: I'm sure the original poster didn't realize that, and thought it would be cute and fun and sexy.  Hollywood has taught us to think like that.  But no, it's kinda the opposite on all points.",

    "postText": "I remember one time I was in a washroom stall on campus and the handle broke. Luckily I managed to get out by crawling under the space between the stall and the floor.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve since been to hotels where the stall goes all the way to the floor. What happens if that handle breaks? Are they supposed to call maintenance? If they don\u2019t have a cellphone on them, or cell reception isn\u2019t good enough to make the call, are they supposed to shout for help? And if no one can hear them, how doable and/or safe is it for them to climb the top of the stall and get out the other side, compared to the risk of waiting and waiting for someone to hear them?",

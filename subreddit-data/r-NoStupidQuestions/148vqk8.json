John Wilkes Booth disagreed with that and killed him to try and prevent it happening and to make an example of him.",

            "comment": "So he was actually assassinated right before the civil war ended. Originally, Booth, a pro-confederate, only wanted to kidnap Lincoln to blackmail the government into releasing confederate prisoners of war. But the confederacy was falling, and Booth attended a speech Lincoln gave where he advocated for rights for freed slaves, and Booth wanted to kill him for this/to prevent it.\n\nHe also got co conspirators to try to kill the vice president and secretary of state, and originally planned to shoot Lincoln and stab Ulysses S Grant at the theater himself, but Grant ended up not coming and the other 2 attempted assassinations failed. So it ended up just being Lincoln. But if he had succeeded in his aims, even though the Confederacy would still have lost the war, it would have been a very devastating blow to the Union- losing the top 3 government officials and the general in command of the entire army.",

But the other conspirators failed their mission. Booth was originally just going to kidnap Lincoln but he decided to assassinate him after he heard that Robert E. Lee surrendered and ended the war.  After he killed Lincoln, he fled to meet the other traitors but they were all caught. Booth was eventually shot while resisting arrest.",

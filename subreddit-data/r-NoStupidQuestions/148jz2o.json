Look at Iran - in the 1950's they were being exploited by Britain for their oil - Britain was taking their oil and Iran wasn't making any money off of it. Iran elected a new prime minister who nationalized the British oil company, and the UK (and USA) arranged to have him overthrown.",

Beyond that though, Venezuela nationalized their oil industry like a lot of the Arab states did, but spent 25 years chronically mismanaging it. The Arabs viewed their oil as a precious resource that needed to be cared for. The Venezuelans viewed it as a never ending piggy bank.",

            "comment": "It can save you the tax money on the money in the account. \n\nIf you have a $3000 FSA account, that reduces your taxable income by $3000.  If you're in the 28% tax bracket, that's $840 on your federal tax return. \n\nYou can pay your copayments, your dentist, or other medical expenses with money that you get tax-free, or money that you pay tax on.    If you think you'll use it, the tax-free option is usually better. \n\nIf you aren't sure you'll use it, then be careful.  You may not be able to get that money back if you don't spend it.   You may have until the end of the calendar year, or perhaps until the following March to spend it.     You can be audited - your HSA/FSA organization can require you to prove your expenses are legit, so don't try to scam them.",

            "comment": "It doesn\u2019t necessarily save you financially - it just not taxed. \n\n\nHowever, it can take a lot of the stress away from dealing with medical expenses, especially if the funds are available in full at the beginning of the year. Some employers don\u2019t allow this, but many do. \n\n\nI always feel better knowing I have enough money in my FSA account to cover my medical expenses. Additionally, if you\u2019re also insured, you can use your HSA/FSA to help cover your deductible early in the year. This way, your insurance benefits actually kick in!",

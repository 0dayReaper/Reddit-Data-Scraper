    "postText": "I read a post earlier on this subreddit regarding someone\u2019s recent experience with Scientologists. Everyone in the replies seemed to agree on two main things:\n\n1. Scientology is a cult and dangerous\n2. And so is the Jehovah\u2019s Witness denomination\n\nI grew up as a JW (my family was never serious about it and we didn\u2019t really adhere strictly to any rules) and it seemed like any other denomination. I am no longer JW, mostly agnostic. \n\nThere are obvious harsh rules like disfellowshipping of family members, but it doesn\u2019t seem any different than what I\u2019ve seen of God fearing Christians in America who will disown family members for their sexual orientation, etc.\n\nAny help or suggestions on where to learn more about this would be appreciated.",

I've heard and read many enough cases of JW rape victims, including adolescents, being blamed for the rape, pressured into not talking about it (only opening up after getting rid of the organization), as well as other forms of both mental and physical abuse there's no way in the world I could call it anything but a cult. Comparing to other religions/sects/cults doesn't really affect this. Disowning your family members for the sake of religion is just a crazy, crazy way of thinking if you ask me.",

    "postText": "There is constant talk in the public zeitgeist about misinformation. Much of it is demonstrably false, so why aren\u2019t there more seditious libel cases?\n\n  \nWhy can public figures spew lies on social media? Why can broadcast television shows become platforms for disinformation? Aren\u2019t behaviors like this exactly what seditious libel laws should protect society from?",

            "comment": "Because seditious libel in the USA only covers very specific things. Like explicitly saying to overthrow the government.\n\nAnd even then, it would be hard to prosecute, because the first amendment and our freedom of speech means you can say damn near everything with no repercussions from the government, even if it is factually wrong.",

However, in some other countries it's still on the books, and individuals are frequently jailed for speaking out against the government.",

In skimming some of the info on that ruling, I did see some mention of the Sedition Act, but otherwise the case seemed indirectly related. Wasn\u2019t it a matter of an official suing NYT for defamation and not a case about lying about the federal government?",

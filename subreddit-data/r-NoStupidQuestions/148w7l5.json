When he's off work and a firetruck goes by with it's sirens on he covers his ears because the sound to him is associated with being on the way to some very stressful scenario.\n2. To this day I get stressed out if I'm chilling at home and hear a car door slam outside, because throughout my whole childhood that meant my dad might be getting home, and he's a very stressful person to be around. \n3. I had a job where my boss was always calling me and was really stressful to talk to all the time, that ringtone filled me with stress and anxiety for a long time after leaving that job, I had to change my ringtone and even then when I heard the same ringtone on someone else's phone I would be filled with stress for a moment until my brain caught up to what was happening and why I was stressed.",

            "comment": "The happiest people on earth are modern-day hunter gatherer tribes. Depression and suicide are non-existent in some of these tribes - to the point that the members find the idea of suicide bizarre and comical. They cannot wrap their heads around the idea of not wanting to live. \n\nThis is because their societies provide them with the things that bring true happiness: \n\n- a close network of friends and family who you know well and trust\n\n- a sense of belonging (because when there are only 30 people, you're probably the best in the village at something)\n\n- lots of physical exercise and sunlight\n\n- lack of exposure to harsh chemicals, junk food, pesticides, pollution, etc that are common in modern societies that deteriorate a person's health\n\n- not on social media, not constantly bombarded with negative news and artifical representations of happiness",

Do activities that allow them to experience flow state.  Focus on experiences rather than material possessions.  Have thinking habits that are based around appreciating what they have instead of imagining what they \u201cshould\u201d have.  Be kind to other people. Exercise, eat, sleep, meditate.\n\nEdited my first sentence to make it more inclusive",

            "comment": "No. Hypoxia from inhaling helium is only really a concern if you\u2019ve filled an airtight room with it. Some people will directly inhale the helium from a balloon and at worst, occasionally faint due to hypoxia, but it\u2019s usually short lived because once you start breathing, the helium will quickly leave and oxygen will fill your lungs again. Most houses\u2019 ventilation will make it so you probably won\u2019t even notice. And the concentration of helium in the air will be pretty minimal in a room",

            "comment": "No, not unless you have so many helium balloons that they take up the vast majority of the interior space inside the building. The air around you is already ~80% nitrogen, another inert gas, and popping a bunch of helium balloons inside a room might take it from 80% to 80.1% inert gas.",

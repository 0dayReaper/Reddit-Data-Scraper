I also had to assure people I snack when I\u2019d like or take the occasional lunch. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to overthink it, most people are too busy to notice / appreciate your helpfulness so they can take a break.\n\nDo be careful to manage your energy, working with kids is rough and you need your moods and focus on peak. Not eating takes a different meaning (I do eat when with kiddo).",

I don\u2019t know about it specifically. \n\nThere\u2019s no need to compare struggles imho. Even to the person who has it all/nothing, their worst pain is still their worst pain. We can all sympathise I\u2019d like to think. \n\nFrom what I recall when I was young I\u2019d weigh myself daily and even multiple times a day, workouts, from a very young age. Then I had a phase of not caring (or pretending not to\u2026). It took a long time to really love myself, and now I feel like it\u2019s possible to truly really love yourself enough to be sufficient and even glow (without trying/validation).\n\nFeel free to DM if it helps, happy to chat in general.\n\nIf it helps, remember to eat enough to keep your sugar and energy in check, lots of water. If you see your moods fluctuate take breaks, track your caffeine too. \n\nI say this cause kids can be highly triggering - it took me learning how to track my son\u2019s routine and hangry etc. and following it a bit, to get me in habits of eating during the day and so on. You learn from managing them cause it\u2019s the same basic biology, and we can\u2019t outsmart biology so I suggest keep the minimum you can and know how you feel at different times (your needs). \n\nOn the flip side as a parent knowing what I know, I\u2019d be concerned for your well-being and also acknowledge your ability to deal with and help chaotic kids relies on that. \n\nIn short, just take care of you first and foremost. Have fun with the kiddos!\n\nPeople wouldn\u2019t think to guess or talk about why you don\u2019t eat. Those that do would be out of line and gossips (I don\u2019t rely on such talk and think less of them than you if I heard it).\n\nETA: Other signs to keep an eye on, shakiness, dizziness, nerves/sensitivity, dry mouth, these can all be linked to dehydration and/or low sugar. Talk to your doctor, they\u2019re really good about telling you good minimums and what to keep an eye out for.\n\nSorry for the unsolicited advice \ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude36",

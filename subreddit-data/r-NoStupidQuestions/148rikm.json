            "comment": "Ice and wood aren't elements.   \n\nWater is a compound. Steel is a mixture or alloy.   Wood is a complex organism, made up of several mixtures.   Coal is also a mixture.  \n\nElements are those 118 specific atomic substances on the periodic table.  Oxygen, Nitrogen, Uranium are elements.  Each atom generally retains the properties of the substance.  \n\nWhen atoms get combined, they can form compounds.   Hydrogen and Oxygen form a bunch of compounds.  One of them is water.  H2O has a particular set of properties like color, smell, freezing point, boiling point, compressibility, density.    Other Hydrogen-Oxygen compounds like Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) have different properties.   \n\nDifferent compounds have different properties.  \n\nWhen we get to things like mixtures, they may or may not retain other properties.   We like steel as a mixture of iron, carbon and other materials.    The mixture does melt at different points, it retains qualities like strength and malleability, and reduces brittleness.  \n\nWood is so many different things.   Some of it is water, so as it is heated the steam can be liberated.   There is a lot of carbon and if we heat the wood in a low-oxygen environment, we can make charcoal.",

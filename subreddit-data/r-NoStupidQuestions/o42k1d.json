It also leads to Belgium being less competitive than neighbors, thus being uninteresting to businesses (both small and large) causing outsourcing, moving companies and too little businesses being started. \nThe indexation was skipped when Belgium had peak unemployment to try to attract business.\n\nBelgium is great to live in. But we have a debt of 96.8% of our GDP. Which is almost double our neighbors' so we have gaps to fill. The lack of competitiveness is perceived as one of the big issues (depending on what party you ask)",

America was the greatest country for straight, white, religious males but everyone else left in the dirt. He certainly makes some great points regarding morality but even that isn't as clean cut as he makes it seem. Overall, I think his point stands but with a giant asterisk next to it.\n\nI really hope we're on the verge of a cultural revolution that upends the inequality we see and deal with every day. There are answers to a lot of the concerns and problems that are out there but we're too busy fighting each other to band together and actually make some changes. I have some hope but it dies a bit more every year.",

I don't know why a megalomaniac would be drawn to government when the vast majority of politicians never have any real power or get any recognition or notoriety.\n\nThat said, it's definitely not easy to get those people elected for important roles if they aren't corrupt.",

You should be very wary whenever someone think as single policy is going to be panacea.\n\nAs an example here's a potential issue with indexing min wage to inflation. Minimum wage increases leads to (some) price increases as labor becomes more expensive. These price increases lead to inflation. So you can sort of create a positive feedback loop where they both feed into each other. Now this isnt going to lead to hyperinflation or anything, but it would make it harder to manage inflation when more things are attached to it.\n\nIf you really want to index wages, then the current consensus seems to be indexing it to around 50 percent of the median wage. The leading min wage researcher is an economist by the name of Dube, I'd encourage you to look into his work if the topic interests you.",

If you\u2019re stationed in Hawaii, your cost of living is going to be way more than if you\u2019re in El Paso, TX.   \n\nYou can\u2019t tie a federal minimum wage to a single rate of inflation because it\u2019s not static across the entire country.   The number you hear quoted on the news is an average.  \n\nSo what would happen is that the federal minimum wage would increase nationally and some states would get raises above the actual increase in cost of living and some states would end up falling behind again because their cost of living is increasing faster than national inflation.  \n\nThe problem is that states, generally, fail to raise their minimum wage at all.  And then every few years/decades when the stars are aligned, some token raise is made to the federal minimum wage.  \n\nAnd the federal government can\u2019t force a state to increase the state minimum wage.  They can set a federal minimum wage but they can\u2019t force Utah to raise their minimum wage based on local inflation.",

Most of the mansions there are owned by either people on the mainland or foreigners (Chinese and Japanese, mostly).  \n\nThere are almost no jobs outside of tourism and most transplants are rich mainlanders  who come over to retire with tons of cash.  \n\nThis has also caused a major brain drain on the island as anybody that is smart enough to get a job on the mainland goes there to make money and hopefully they can afford to move back home and retire there one day.   \n\nIronically, it\u2019s very difficult to find a job in Hawaii if you\u2019re on the mainland and want to move there.  \n\nThe insane cost of living and the relatively low wages they can pay usually means that after the honeymoon period wears off newly hired mainlanders quit and move back to the mainland as quickly as possible.  \n\nLike, it\u2019s almost impossible to get a recruiter or employer to respond to you unless you have an 808 area code phone number and a Hawaii address on your resume.",

Like, certain places have already passed extra taxes on shitty unhealthy food, that already breaks the whole premise because the alleged hamburger is now more expensive in country A than in country B and that should throw off the index considerably.

                            "comment": "I'm really tired of saying this over and over:\n\nMembers of Congress need to have good incomes from Congress. Otherwise the only people getting elected will be millionaires or \"supplement their income\" by becoming corrupt.\n\nBefore someone replies with a stupid cynical comment about that already being the case, lemme point out that the first wave of millennials elected mostly are co-renting in DC. Some actually slept on the couch or floor of their Congressional offices when they first got there.\n\nEdit: Okay, because I'm getting stupid responses, lemme explain -\n\nThe premise of either sabotaging Congressional wages or tying it to some other metric is that it will create an incentive for Congress to pass laws or increase minimum wages. The latter is being argued in this thread.\n\nThe problem with this is that it also creates a *punitive* action for a lack of action. Let's say for a moment that Congress only gets 5x federal minimum wage - nevermind that they are employees in the District of Columbia where the minimum wage is significantly higher for a moment.\n\nNow Congressional members are only making about $75k before taxes (I'm assuming you also would not exempt them). This is not enough to rent a place in DC, on top of maintaining a home in, let's say, San Francisco. $75k/year pre-taxes isn't even enough to rent in SF and DC at the same time.\n\nIf that person has no other job or income, they are going to leave Congress no matter how altruistic or good they are at their job. This would result in bankruptcy or extreme poverty, full stop.\n\nMeanwhile, the millionaires from everywhere else don't give a shit. That SF rep is in dire straits - they have nothing at all - while the millionaire members can continue to *not* raise the minimum wage in order to crush poor members under debt and financial hardship.\n\nWorse, some of those poor members might decide \"Well, fuck this, I can't survive like this but I want to stay in politics.\" So, they start engaging in corruption. Maybe they trade extremely bad policy votes in order to raise Congressional wages. Maybe they vote for horrendous acts in order to get \"speaking gigs\" from huge corporations to supplement their income. Maybe they help appoint judges or corporate lobbyists to important positions in order to get a lucrative post-Congressional job.\n\nDecreasing wages of Congress does *not* do what people think it does. The extremely elite, wealthy individuals will *continue* to be wealthy **and** they won't care. Take away $100k/year and it will literally not matter one bit to people like Mitch McConnell, or honestly even to wealthy individuals like Bernie Sanders. It will not change their opinions or their politics. The *only* thing it will do is hurt poor members of Congress, who ultimately are outnumbered, and the end result of that is you are driving an entire class of people out of politics.\n\nIf anything, you should dramatically *increase* wages in Congress, to try and dilute the impact of wealthy interests *outside* of government. If every member of Congress was pulling down $500k/year without any side-gigs, maybe it would eliminate some of (obviously not all of) the influence that money has in our politics.\n\nEdit2: Since a day later, I'm still getting incredibly stupid responses, just going to add - the point isn't to stop greed. The point is to provide reasonable living wage for the job. By nuking wages in Congress, you aren't stopping wealthy people from being abusive, you're just hurting the lowest earners in Congress. That's the whole point of minimum wage in the first place - to try and give people a working income. And people keep suggesting that maybe if we hurt (poor) members of Congress, then they'll change. Stop being fucking stupid.",

Call them \"essential\" or \"the jobs we clapped for for about 3 months until we got tired of doing it but they risked their lives for us every day\", but the jobs need to be accomplished. I don't believe it's reasonable to force someone to commute 2+ hours a day just to make sure the trash in my office cubical is empty, simply because they can't afford to live any closer, and don't have a skill set that commands 6 figures.\n\nMy point is that the argument around $15 federal minimum wage is missing the bigger picture - setting a simple dollar amount doesn't account for local economic conditions. But the data exists to do something smarter - like tying it to a local COI or something similar. That's all BAH is, just in the housing market. This then becomes your new wage floor, and local municipalities can up it if they need to - but they could never go below. It gets updated once a year just like BAH or social security, and never has to be reauthorized by Congress - so it's hands off.\n\nPolitically though this doesn't energize anyone - \n\n\"what do we want? A COI based minimum wage that is also indexed with inflation and based on local economic conditions! When do we want it? Now!\" \n\nBut it's probably a smarter way to go. Even though some areas like Socorro, NM would probably be under $15/he and some places like Denver would be at $20+.",

I think you would have some areas try to manipulate the calculation by making cost of living seem much lower than it actually is. I think a better alternative would be force change at the company level. This could be done in two ways: \n\n1. Tax companies at a higher rate. Companies can avoid paying these taxes by reinvesting into the company including increasing wages. So wages as a whole would go up for everyone. \n\n2. Tax companies for each individual person on their payroll collecting food stamps or other federal assistance. The person collecting federal assistance should be kept anonymous with strict penalties around sharing that info. The penalty should be more expensive than just increasing wages. Some exceptions might be made for smaller companies. The intention would be to after large companies like wal-mart who can afford to pay people more, but instead use these social safety nets as a way to subsidize their workforce and pay people less.",

Working off the current system, it should be that the federal minimum is the lowest COL out of any of the states and then each state (or county would be better but definitely a lot more work) could do a rounded percentage above based on their area. So for example, if Idaho has the absolute cheapest COL (I\u2019m pulling the state out of my ass here) and it could be $15/hr to live, that\u2019s the minimum across the USA. Say Virginia is 25% more expensive to live in than idaho, then $15 x 1.25 is $18.75 so that would be their minimum. \n\nI\u2019d like to think that\u2019s how the system was meant to be, and maybe it was created that way but I\u2019m too lazy to look it up right now, and it definitely doesn\u2019t work that way now",

Most are pushing for $15, which while good for many states, would wreck the economies of rural areas, so not even democrats from those areas support it. Republicans are even worse, as they don\u2019t want it raised at all for some unknown reason. TL:DR It doesn\u2019t benefit enough politicians for them to do anything about it.",

Employers usually don't adjust wages to the inflation because the market usually shifts back to equilibrium pretty often in most cases. Shifting wages because of inflation would only really be saving pennies or can be accrued in an end of a year bonus or commission of some sorts. The only positions I might consider to be adjusted to inflation would be public or federal employees since those jobs typically adjust/react fairly slowly to changes in the market economy.",

Within a few months some businesses had to close because they couldn\u2019t keep up or work out the new minimum wage with their profit margin. \n\nI\u2019m all for increasing but I think doing it slowly instead of all at once would be a better way to go. Work out a schedule to increase it yearly and allow businesses to adjust and make the appropriate moves to maintain that pay grade. Helps keep businesses open and people employed.",

            "comment": "HIV requires sexual contact or being exposed to infected blood and somehow getting it into your body. It's likely that the virus didn't survive on the glass surface as it is exposed to dry air and UV from the sun which kills it.\n\nNow if you have open sores, you touch fresh wet infected blood smeared on the window (gross) and by chance, the virus makes into your body, then maybe. It's unlikely that you have leaned against something so obviously dirty.",

If it is infected, keep an eye on it and if it gets worse, go see a doctor, though that's really unlikely. It'll get better on its own.\n\nAll that being said, if any part of it is an open wound, it should be covered. Don't be in a hurry to show it off -- follow the directions you were given.\n\nAnd if you must show it off before it's fully cooked, at least put some Polysporin on it -- that will reduce the chances of any infection by contact like this to zero.",

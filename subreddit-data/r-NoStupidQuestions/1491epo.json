    "postText": "So I met this guy in 2021 lets call him bob, now bob is the sweetest guy youll ever meet and you could say he is loyal but maybe too loyal. So I met him at a birthday party and ive been talking to him ever since. We became super close and would hang out with eachother every chance we got. But then 2022 i met this girl that ive known of because we\u2019ve been in the same school for eight years, but I just didn\u2019t talk to her. I started becoming friends with her and her friends, but also while being really good friends with Bob. Eventually after talking to this girl for a while I started FaceTimeing her almost every day while still talking to Bob. We became super close, and I would add Bob to the FaceTime when I wanted to talk to both of them. Eventually, this became an every day thing with talking to the both of them and out of the blue. They would start talking without me, and of course, like everyone else I started to develope FOMO. NOW I DID SOMETIMES ASK TO BE ADDED TO THE CALL, BUT SOMETIMES THE GIRL WOULD SAY NO AND I RESPECTED THAT BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY WOULD LIKE TO TALK THEMSELVES, BUT AS TIME WENT ON, WE EVENTUALLY FORMED OUR OWN FRIEND GROUP, AND THIS FRIEND GROUP CONSISTED OF SIX GIRLS AND FOUR BOYS. (Siri is stupid idk why its all caps ill just type now). as time went on they started to develope feelings for eachother so i let them be but at times i still wanted to talk to my closest friends, so I would ask to get added and once bob did add me after a couple minutes the girl would leave then call bob back, it wasnt like they were talking about anything important in the first place. So i started to get mad after them doing this 10-15 times, i started to get pissed and i had to talk to them twice about it and they both said the bull shit things about \u201coh you arent losing us and we will try to find a balance with all of you guys\u201d this happened twice and they still havent done that in 3 months, now they are dating after i helped get them over the hump of I like you, u like me, but nothing was happening. I shouldnt have done that knowing that what is happening now would occur. At this time it is summer and ofc they are spending every wakening second with eachother when if they werent dating bob would be all over me and the unnamed girl would be all over her best friend of 10 years but no, they are with eachother and they havent been trying to do anything we me or any of the other friends, ofcourse they would go to the whole group hang outs but only if the other one was there. And just for an example of what has been happening for the past couple of months, today inwas supposed to go to a small city with bob, he had asked me to go yesterday infront of the girl and so she had knew about it, well today came and went and he said nothing to me all day but once i said smth to him at about 3-4 he said \u201coh yea we arent going anymore\u201d (like thanks for the memo bro), then i see on snap maps just an hour later that he is at the girls house and they went off doing their own thing. I honestly just want to tell them both off but ive kept my composure this whole time. I slightly confronted him about it tonight and my other friend we were playing online with asked him if he had any explination, ofcourse he acted like a deer in head lights stuttering almost like he was stimming. I know for a fact that both of them are going to be that couple that blows all of their friends off then once they break up they have no one. Should i let that happen or should i try harder? Or should i just see where it takes them, let them have their own decisions on what is best for them then once they do break up i wont give a rata ass for them and completely ghost them?? You guys tell me if im just being to sensitive or not, because this hasnt happend with my other friends and their gfs just them. But hey maybe i am being overly sensitive but someone please tell me if i am!!!!",

In the end, you want them both happy correct? Because you love them as friends and they are happy right now, yes? It just sucks they aren\u2019t including you and changing plans to purposefully not include you which could be considered jealousy even though it is justified. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t get nasty or go full ghost blocking them and such (up to you though), I would just step back and start hanging out with other people. Let them miss you a bit. They will find an equilibrium eventually and want you around. Lots of people get infatuated during their honeymoon period. Make the decision later once you have taken some time away, so you are less emotional about the situation. Just my opinion. I hope it helps. 33F and have dealt with a number of friends coming and going. It is normal enough, just wait until some of your friends have kids.",

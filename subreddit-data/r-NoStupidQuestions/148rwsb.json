    "postText": "So I bought a mistubishi outlander limited addition in red last year around summer in august, I did not get an oil change until last summer. My dad tells me my car will let me know when it\u2019s time for an oil change, I get this light that says routine maintenance required, it goes on when I start the car but goes right off after. My dad tells me when it stays on it is then time for a dealership checkup, while my mom disagrees. I don\u2019t know who to believe. Clearly my dad probably knows cars more than my mother. She was not there when I bought the car only my uncle and my father. Would it hurt to go to the dealership for an oil change or do I wait for my car to tell me otherwise?! Idk what to do I know nothing about cars!",

Your car will tell you when your oil life gets low enough but, if you don't drive a ton, oil filters also expire with time.  It's not going to destroy your car not doing that but it's not going to help it's lifespan.",

            "comment": "What year is your Outlander? \n\n\nFor older cars, it\u2019s recommended to change the oil every 3,000 miles or three months. Most modern cars, under normal driving conditions, can typically go between 5,000 to 7,500 miles before needing an oil change. \n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s normal for the check engine light to briefly illuminate when you start your car and then turn off immediately. When you start the engine, the vehicle's onboard diagnostic system performs a self-check to ensure that all the sensors and components are functioning properly. During this self-check, the check engine light may briefly come on as part of the initialization process. \n\n\nIf the check engine light turns off quickly and remains off while you're driving, it typically indicates that the vehicle's systems are operating properly. \n\n\nHowever, if the check engine light remains illuminated, flashes, or comes on and off intermittently while driving, it may indicate an underlying problem that requires attention - this is always worth a trip to the dealership/mechanic.",

I feel like it's probably an easy fix but I have no idea wth I am doing and am too embarrassed to tell my landlord incase it is just something dumb and simple.",

If that's stuck open, it'll just keep filling. \n\nIt's fixable, and depending on the machine it's not terribly difficult, but it's an honest fault - it should be your landlord that sorts it.",

    "postText": "I (F) was getting to know someone  who was potentially gonna be my fubu (M), until we got to talking about threesomes.\n\nHe said that he's had threesomes before, FFM ones. I asked if he'd ever consider participating in an MMF threesome but said that he \"(didn't) want to participate if there (was) gonna be two dicks in the room.\" I explained that in my opinion, MMF threesomes are more for the lady partner than for the guy partner, and that if someone was to ask me for an FFM threesome, I'd automatically ask for an MMF one, just so they knew the weight of their request. \n\nI know that it depends on preference, but it just makes me think about how women are mostly seen as objects. I feel like although people are in a fwb situation, both parties should want what's most pleasureful for both of them. That being said, is he a red flag?",

Competition for a mate is a very normal thing in the animal kingdom and humans are animals like any other.\n\nSexuality is a complex thing, saying \"you're comfortable with X so you must also accept Y\" isn't fair to any party involved, even if on the surface it may seem that way.",

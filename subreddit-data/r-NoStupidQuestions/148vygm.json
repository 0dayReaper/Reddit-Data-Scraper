    "postText": "I was applying for jobs, and it seems like a lot of minimum wage customer representative jobs that are work-from-home take sooo much longer to get back to you than the ones that pay $10-15/hr more. I applied at a local truck delivery place and got an interview within hours. At other places that also pay medium wage it took less than a week to get an interview. At several work-from-home minimum wage jobs it took at least 3 weeks to get any answer.",

At a Wal Mart that employs 100 people, you might literally see 300 people come and go in any six month span of time. They take longer to get back to you because they have a stack of 150 applications ahead of yours to process.\n\nWell run businesses who pay decent wages are just more on top of things.",

            "comment": "If a company is paying more than minimum wage it means that labor is scarce enough that it needs to pay more to attract it. If it's paying minimum wage, it means that labor is so abundant that it doesn't need to pay more than the minimum to attract it. Therefore, you can expect there will be more competition (abundant labor) in the market for minimum wage jobs, and some sort of requirement or restriction for higher wage jobs.",

            "comment": "Not saying the below applies to you specifically (as there could be other factors specific to yourself). Particularly as you choosing between a WFH job and a delivery truck are completely different. But.....\n\nThe general trend of minimum wage jobs being harder to get is exactly what you should expect to be honest. You have a lower bar which means a wider range of people can apply - which means the employer can be more picky with who they choose. Plus, them getting so many applicants means yours is less likely to be seen before they find another candidate.\n\nContrary to popular belief, employers don't have to recruit the first applicant who fits the minimum criteria. Additionally, minimum wage WFH jobs are far more likely to go to the most qualified/ experienced candidates (who are also probably going to negotiate for more than minimum wage). Also, popularity of WFH is even more intense post-covid.\n\nDepending on how qualified you are, higher-wage jobs tend to have tighter requirements - or else are where there's less qualified (or willing) applicants. Employers can't really afford to be as picky in regards to who they select (out of the range of qualified applicants).",

It isn't based on our bodily needs.\n \nIf I had to guess (being ignorant on the subject), I'd wager it is more of our bodies adapting to 8 hours of sleep than anything. I know some need more or less (example: personally I'm good with 7 hours).",

The idea was that days should be structured into 8 hours of work, 8 hours of \"recreation\" (anything not work) and 8 hours of sleep. It has nothing to do with the length of night, which changes based on time of year and where in the world you are.",

People are frequently proud of their respective heritages. It\u2019s also racist/ethnocentric to consider being called something else an insult. However, it\u2019s common for many of us of a Latin background to get mislabeled, which gets tiring. A friend of mine once referred to me as a Puerto Rican, and I didn\u2019t respond well. It also sucks when you meet fellow Latin people who giggle about your national ancestry because they\u2019re from somewhere else. Bottom line, people frequently suck.",

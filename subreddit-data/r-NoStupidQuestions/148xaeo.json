I would recommend sitting down and making a list of what you want for your life, a basic image of your ideal future life and all your goals and work on them one by one, being full aware that things might change along the way but at least you\u2019re taking steps now towards what you know you want. Then, make another list of all the things you think are getting in the way (or could get in the way) of achieving this and make a vow to stop or lessen them.",

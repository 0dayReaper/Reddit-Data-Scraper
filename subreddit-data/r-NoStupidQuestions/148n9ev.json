Like I know it is something I can do but just the mere act of looking seems like such a stressful task that I can't do it. I've never had this problem ever with schoolwork and stuff like that before. What can I do?",

            "comment": "It is really scary! Two strategies that have helped me:\n\n1. Break it down into tiny tiny pieces, like \"Open your resume, add stuff from the past year to it, edit your linked in, make a list of jobs you might apply to, open the job application,\" etc. Then, focus on checking as many tiny items off the list as you can, trying not to think about the overall goal at all.\n\n2. Talk to people who are doing the kinds of jobs you might want to do. Ask them about their career path and ask for advice about yours. You will often have a way better idea what you want after doing this and then applying will be easier",

            "comment": "Try and identify what specifically scares you. \n\nDo you feel overwhelmed with the work load? Try and break the task down into smaller ones until the small ones don't feel scary anymore. Go down to \"open word document\", \"write down first name, last name, age\", etc. if you have to.\n\nIf you worry about not meeting your own expectations in terms of quality? Any task worth doing, is worth doing shitty. Start writing however shit it might look to you. A first draft can be edited afterwards, but a blank page stays blank.\n\nWorried about not getting any positive results? People will only see the finished results, they won't know your thoughts behind it. They won't know how much better you feel section x or y could have been. They don't know what the idea looked like in your head, they can only see what your final results are. And people are a lot more charitable to others work than their own, especially since you're a college grad. Nobody expects you to have all the knowledge at this stage in life.",

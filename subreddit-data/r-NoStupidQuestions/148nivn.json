    "postText": "So I tried my first year of college just a little shy of a year ago and I completely messed everything up. I was already struggling in high school because of my horrible work ethic and lack of drive recently. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I sometimes barely feel motivated to get out of bed in the morning, much less start commuting to college with less than half of an idea of what I even want to major in. My entire family obviously isn\u2019t happy with this, and I have two options. 1: Get sent to live with my grandmother. (Not a Great option if I don\u2019t want to get shamed by my family the entire way there.) 2: Go to college and just pray I\u2019m not still an idiot by then. \n\nI\u2019m turning 19 tomorrow, so it\u2019s no surprise why this is happening, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not still confused. I can barely talk to my mom about this without her shouting at me and putting a world\u2019s worth of pressure onto me in 3 sentences. I find it impossible to talk to her without just feeling like she\u2019s just trying to get rid of me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely unbiased, since this is the same woman who wanted me to work at Amazon (which I\u2019ve heard is literal hell on earth) JUST because one of her friends worked there. \n\nI\u2019m practically clueless. She\u2019s making me apply to random colleges near us as I type this. I don\u2019t know what major I want, what kind of future job I WOULD want, nor do I know what kind of college I even want to go to. It\u2019s all so overwhelming and she\u2019s so hard to talk to nowadays. \n\nWhat do I do? Please.",

For example I learned I hated electrical engineering but found mechanical to be decent enough. Now I make way more money than I did at Caesars and may work days tend to be way easier too. Engineering isnt my passion but I'm good enough at it, make good money, and my coworkers are friendly so even if I don't achieve my dreams, at least I'm garuenteed a comfortbable acceptable life.\n\nI guess the TLDR is sometimes it's way easier to figure out what you want to do by trying things and figuring out what you really DONT want to do. Knowing what you hate helps narrow your options.\n\nI worked a LC and a factory job before this one and both really showed me how much I didn't want to work those jobs forever. They make my current job seem really nice in comparison.",

            "comment": "Sounds similar to what I went through when I first went to uni.\n\nFirst off, sounds like you may be struggling with a mental illness. In my case, it was depression and that really contributed to lack of motivation and poor grades. If possible, try and see a psychologist and see if there is anything they can do in terms of treatment and medication.\n\nI suggest you deal with this first. I did not address my issues until after I failed two years of uni and got kicked out. For what it's worth, I got my shit together eventually. I worked for a year then began taking some courses part-time to get back into things and figure out what I wanted to do while getting my confidence back. Eventually got my undergrad and now just graduated with a law degree. But if you can avoid that expensive and lengthy lesson to get there, I'd suggest that.\n\nYou do not need to worry about exactly what you want to do right away. Depending on your capacity, go to uni part-time or full-time and try and get a mix of classes. Doing some common prereqs mixed with electives that seem interesting to you is a good way to go about it to try and figure out if anything piques your interest.\n\nIf nothing interests you, that's okay too. Take time off uni and work. University is not for everyone and unless you see yourself doing something that requires a degree, it's better to take time off than waste four years (and lots of money) getting a piece of paper you won't use just because your parents pressured you into it. Maybe take a look at some local trades schools.",

I still struggle with those thoughts for sure and I'm not saying you necessarily do have it, but worth at least seeing a doctor or psychologist if you can.\n\nAt the very least, even if it's not a mental illness, talking to a professional can help provide you some insight into yourself that you might not get otherwise so I highly recommend it!",

I did really enjoy my job at Starbucks that I worked at before going back to school then continued part-time during school. Made a lot of friends there that I still am very close with today (including my two closest friends). So, having a good support network of friends, especially ones in similar situations as yourself (i.e. unsure university-age students) is important and I found that work was great for making those connections.\n\nYour mileage may vary depending on your relationships with your family, but being more open/honest about your struggles or doubts might help. My mom did not know much of what was going on with me so when I got kicked out of uni things were very bad between us for a bit until I broke down and she got me to see a psychologist. After that, there was a greater understanding of *why* I was struggling that wasn't just me being \"lazy\" etc. Again, depending on your relationship with your parents and their level of understanding or willingness to learn about mental health etc, this may or may not be an option.\n\nConsidering I struggled with school, it really helped for me to slowly return to full time classes by only taking 2-3 per semester at the beginning. Don't rush trying to graduate in four years if you don't know what you want to do. Also feel free to follow random interests. For example, I liked the show Criminal Minds at the time, so I decided \"okay I'll major in Sociology\" and I took a criminology course which I liked, but none of the other Sociology courses were open so I filled my schedule with some Psychology courses which I loved even more so I switched my major. I looked for some postgrad stuff in psych but faced a lot of rejections despite my great GRE score and GPA, mostly because they wanted volunteer and research experience as well.\n\nWhile I tried to get those done, I continued working and ended up taking some HR classes, one of which was employment law. I really enjoyed that, decided to try the LSAT, and eventually got into law school and now at 34 (16 years after my first year at uni lol), I just got my law degree and started articling and I'm really enjoying it.\n\nSo you really never know where the path will take you and how you will discover what you love. The hardest part is recognizing that your journey is different than others so try your best to not compare yourself. I saw plenty of classmates in law who knew they wanted to do law right from the womb pretty much haha. And I sometimes would be jealous of that sureness they had, but I've learned to appreciate my journey, as lame as that sounds haha.",

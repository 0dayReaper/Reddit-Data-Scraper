The modern physics tell us that the 4 dimensional space that we can observe wraps around itself like a Klein bottle. To be able to bend, our universe lives in a hyperspace of 11 dimensions. Our universe is just a bubble inside a vast multiverse of infinite dimensions. You should read more math. Read about Conways surreal numbers. There are infinite number of infinites. The universe is so vast that it cannot fit in your finite human monkey head. Read about Islam read the Quran and it will bring you peace. Christianity is childish, Islam is abstract.",

It's the simplest way I know to get spiritually and religion without the crazy legalism and doctrinal issues that's so off-putting to us non-believers. If you're not gay, don't worry: the only gay-friendly churches that are probably going to have an all-gay congregation are the Metropolitan Community Church, a denomination that was originally founded for LGBT Christians to have a place to worship.\n\nAny other church that welcomes LGBT people is probably mostly made up of tolerant straight people.",

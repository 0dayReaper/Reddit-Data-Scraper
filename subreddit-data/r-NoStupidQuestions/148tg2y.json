This phrase was borrowed from another Reddit question asking people to list songs they liked BOTH ironically and unironically, and nobody else batted an eye, they just started listing songs.... as if this wasn't basically a contradictory request. \n\nSo I wanted to ask stupidly analytical questions about what the phrase itself actually means, or any way that it may somehow not be paradoxical?",

You don't care much for it the first time or even first couple times, but the more you listen, you start noticing the melodies that... hey, that's actually pretty catchy actually... \n\nYou might keep coming back to that song and noticing even more details that actually make it a pretty well written song. But you may still not necessarily like the majority of music in that particular genre.\n\nI feel like the phrase is often used about songs that are likely what that person would consider goofy or parody, where you sorta go in thinking \"I'll never like this in a million years\".",

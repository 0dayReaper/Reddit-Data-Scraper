            "comment": "You've got a few factors to consider. \n\n1) there are literally more inhabited planets than there are active Jedi at their highest strength. Even during the Republic, 99% of citizens never saw a Jedi in person, and 99.99999% of those same citizens never saw the Jedi use any powers. The average citizen of the Republic was probably pretty skeptical of the Jedi actually having powers, and instead suspected that they were just leaning on legends of their powers to conduct their diplomatic missions. Sure, maybe the Jedi had powers long ago, but these days you're pretty skeptical of the whole thing.\n\n2) the Empire, which controls virtually all interplanetary communications through the Holo-net, set about eradicating every record of the Jedi's power and influence. Where they couldn't erase stuff, they set about gas lighting the population about the corruption and fraud that was rife in the Jedi order, to the point that most people would believe that the Jedi had been tricking the Republic before Palpatine came along to save it.\n\n3) anyone that had concrete info about the Jedi knew to keep their heads down and play along, or risk attracting the attention of the Empire and Vader's efforts to eradicate the remaining Jedi. This fear of openly discussing them would cause the Jedi to quickly fall into legends.",

Think of Jabba like a mafia boss - the Empire/Government might not like them, but when you have a galaxy to try and control, having someone else who can keep the peace can be handy. So the Empire had a small garrison on Tatooine (they had a military presence, but it wasn't big in terms of scale), let Jabba do his thing in the Hutt Space under the knowledge that it might be easier to let the long term mob boss survive rather than cause a chaotic power vacuum.",

Like modern day.  We know psychics exist, but to actually meet one that can read minds and see the future?  Yeah, that's a legend.",

Your average Joe might know who Patton or McArthur were but, do you really know a lot of people who knows the names of more than handful of generals during the begining of the afghan war?

The ratio of Humans on earth per United states president is much much much smaller than the ratio of sentient creatures in the Star wars galaxy to Jedi.\n\nWe know, for example, that Coruscant had TRILLIONS of people. \n\nAnd that's one planet in the middle of things. And even then 99.9999% of people on Coruscant almost certainly had no clue about the Jedi other than \"big important religious types, work for the government, can apparently do freaky things with their mind but that's probably rancor dung\".\n\nNow imagine a planet so far disconnected from the Republic that they only get one republic vessel every few months for Tax purposes. They aren't going to know anything about some small subset of a far off and poorly connected government.",

So basically the war was just palptines 2 armys fighting each other to make the entire galaxy vulnerable. And while this was happening, other real wars were taking place and tons of people needed the jedi for other reasons. Jedi are monks not warriors, as Qui gon said in episode 1 \"i can only protect you, not fight your war\" (something like that). At most they shouldve trained the clones and left the war be as they usually do, unless sith are involved. Sith being involved though is kinda why they went over the top and lost their way. They stopped focusing on just sith and treated the Droid army as if they were just as important as the sith.",

The only armies and navies were planetary or system wide, and no Republic Army or appatus had existed since the Russan Reformation.  The Jedi had led armies in the far past and have good institutional record keeping, still operated strike teams that worked with local forces across the galaxy, and were politically neutral enough that no senator could object to picking them over a planetary Cadre to take over the new Grand Army.",

Imagine being on Naboo but simply on the other side and having no clue that any real battle was taking place at any time.\n\nBut one thing to add: the original *Star Wars* before it even had a *IV* added to the name - and after - didn't really have that fleshed out. You might even presume that the empire held sway over far more of the sentient universe maybe. It was only in later series where they may have remarked on some planets' numbers and so on that it became so big. Before it really wasn't explicated.\n\nAnd if you think back to Ancient times on Earth - an emperor might have a seat of power but they really just had command over those right below. A lot of major conflicts and events got back to them but they weren't necessarily involved. They just had to trust shit was happening. Same with the empire.",

The Galactic Republic was the ruling body prior to and during the Clone Wars crisis, featuring a fully democratic Senate body, led by a chancellor. The jedi were a seperate religious order of peace keeping warrior monks, based on Coruscant, who were conscripted to help the Republic win the war against the confederacy of independent systems (aka the separatists). As the CIS's Droid army ran over entire planets and decimated systems, slaughtering millions in the process, the jedi decided that helping end the Droid threat was the best thing they could do to help restore peace in the galaxy. Prior to the war they mostly kept to themselves and focused on helping people across the galaxy without involving themselves in politics. Many of them aren't brave enough for politics, afterall. \n\n2. The Jedi were pretty mysterious to most non-coruscant based people of the galaxy, unless they had a direct connection to them. Again, they were a sect of warrior wizards who followed an ancient code and were generally not involved with the day to day lives of most people. In Clone Wars we see several scenarios where a planetary government is having some kind of power struggle, but the Jedi can't do anything about it because their code forbids them from involving themselves in the affairs of sovereign nations, unless directly related to the war against the separatists. This is how Mandalore was lost, with no Jedi intervention whatsoever. Maul was not a sith (anymore) nor a separatist, and the Deathwatch were a native mandalorian group, so the jedi could not intervene in their internal political affairs. \n\n3. After the fall of the Republic post ROTS, the new empire destroyed the jedi temple and most of the information about the jedi order. Outside of those who were around for and directly involved with the Clone Wars, no one would know much about them other than they were religious fanatics who carried laser swords. Especially after a few decades as the myth of the magical warrior wizards faded and those who spread their message were silenced. \n\nUltimately there are going to be small inconsistencies, since obviously they didnt know everything about the prequels while making the original trilogy. But I think it *mostly* lines up pretty good of youre willing to forgive a few small foibles. \n\nOne thing the Clone Wars series did *so* well was illustrating the stark difference between the government of the Galactic Republic, and the Jedi order. While the Jedi were involved in the war effort, they were not a ruling body at any point, and any time they want to do something they have to run it by the Chancellor or submit a vote to the Galactic Senate beforehand. Throughout the series, the Jedi answer to the Republic (and therefore who we all know Palpatine really is) and often times this leads to them not being able to help someone or not being quick enough to stop a plot that costs lives. The Republic is shown to be highly corrupt and heavily flawed, and eventually that Republic becomes the Empire after order 66, as the Senate votes and signs over all power to the Chancellor, aka The Sith lord Palpatine, who immediately abolished democracy and establishes his empire.",

Any of these groups that held pro-Jedi sentiments(Church of the Force springs to my mind) would be targeted for removal, likely for religious extremism because of the association with the Jedi Order. The ones that may not have liked the Jedi, but weren't pro Sith/Empire (Like the Nightsisters) would have likely shared a similar fate. That leaves any organization that would have been or could be convinced to be pro Empire or Sith. These groups would be either absorbed to utilize as a fighting tool, and for Palpatine/Vader(Depending on who specifically was overseeing the operation at the time) to find a new apprentice. Both were looking, after all. If they couldn't be used for fighting or experiments in the Force (I'm thinking pro-Empire branches of the Church of the Force) they would have their organization turned into a puppet of the Empire. Also, a lot of non-Jedi force groups operated under some level of secrecy because iirc the Jedi Order for most of its involvement in the Galactic government considered all Force practicing groups that weren't them Sith or Sith-adjacent.",

He pretty much made it up as he went along, occasionally accepting creative input from others until his head got too big.\n\nObi-Wan states that the Jedi were the guardians of the Republic for more than a thousand generations, but a few characters make it obvious that Force users/worshippers were generally viewed with skepticism at best. Han Solo, who would have been alive during the supposed purge (albeit only ten or fifteen at the oldest), initially thought it was a bunch of superstitious mumbo-jumbo, and despite Vader's obvious power, many in the Empire wrote off the Force as an old, dying religion.\n\nI think it's more likely that the Jedi (and the Sith) would have lived quiet, monastic lifestyles dedicated to studying their own beliefs, similar to Catholic and Buddhist monks. They would have been viewed as secretive, perhaps even cultish, by outsiders, coming forth only as needed. Conspirators would have viewed them as having an unhealthy influence on the government, much like conspiracy theorists today view groups like the Freemasons with suspicion.\n\nConsequently, after Palpatine became the Chancellor, he wouldn't have simply walked in and said, \"Hey, dudes, I'm the Emperor,\" but he would have gone total Nazi-style and focused on magnifying and spreading a strong anti-Jedi sentiment among the population, radicalizing his supporters, and declaring himself the Emperor only after gaining enough influence to guarantee he could defend such a position.",

I got the impression that Obi-Wan went into exile when he was a young man, and Vader's eventual unmasking made it seem like that was the case, too. More believable that folks like Han and the Imperials of little faith born well after Jedi were extinct might think everything was exaggerated.\n\nThat said, it makes the circumstances of Luke and Leia's births all the weirder. Sure that's because it wasn't the original idea, and Lucas was retconning as he went along, but it could have been an interesting backstory if Amidala was still with Anakin/Vader up until twenty years prior, and faked her death when she got pregnant or something, and got off Coruscant with Obi-Wan's help.",

He's great at the general framework, but sucks at the details. That's why the OT was better, because others worked out the details. When the PT came along, no one dared question Lucas, so his weaker points came out, namely directing and screenwriting. \n\nThe Jedi should have been nomadic, only showing up when help is needed. They allow the force to guide them to where they're needed. They protect the republic from the shadows.   \nNever show, perhaps never even mention Yoda. Yoda lives on Dagobah. He never left there. He's quite content to live at his 'slimy mud hole' home. \"Wars do not make one great.\"  \nBetter show (don't tell!) the friendship between Anakin and Obi, which you'd have more time to do if Anakin was a late teenager, at youngest, during Ep I.  \n*Never* show Anakin becoming Vader. Leave it implied that Obi failed with Anakin, and tried again with another pupil, so the movies can be watched in numeric order and not ruin the reveal in Ep V (as much as can be not spoiled for a 40 year old movie).  \nKeep the mystical aspects of the force. Remove the physical connection (midichlorians).\n\nLots of other problems with the PT, really. Lucas should have hung back and guided, but stayed away from the directing and screenplays. His ideas are great. His execution is flawed.",

Combine that that there were only thousands of Jedi spread out through the galaxy and most everyday people would never have interacted with one...making the Empire\u2019s job that much easier.",

On a planet like Earth, that's a very small minority, but in a galaxy filled with trillions of life forms, that's incredibly minuscule.\n\nThe Jedi were only really active in Republic space. They didn't get to go to the outer rim or even some mid rim worlds outside of Republic space. So in a massive galaxy, they only got to go to a handful of planets. Many people outside of the Republic probably didn't believe in them, and those that did never understood the difference between Jedi and Sith.\n\nThe Empire completely wiped out the Jedi. Utterly and completely. Not just killing them, but erasing them from history. Jedi temples were destroyed along with their records. All traces of the Jedi, aside from the few in hiding, were completely gone.\n\nAnd so the Empire wiped their records, so no one was to learn about them in school or anything. The generation of children growing up at the dawn of the Empire, didn't learn about the Jedi, and people who were adults during the Jedi's existence, didn't talk about them, it was taboo. The Empire wanted the Jedi gone from history and so it was done. Talking about the Jedi would make you seem like a sympathizer and probably get you imprisoned or worse.\n\nAnd most people didn't want to talk about Jedi, because they didn't see them as heroes and wanted them gone. The Jedi were blamed for the Clone Wars, and seen as warmongers, not Guardians of peace. By the time the Clone Wars came to an end, most Republic citizens hated the Jedi and saw them as corrupt, so they easily believed Palpatine when he said they tried to overthrow the Republic, and went along with them being wiped out.

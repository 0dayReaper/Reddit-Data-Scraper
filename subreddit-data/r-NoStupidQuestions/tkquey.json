It\u2019s really taxing on the body and pushes it to the limit of what it can do. Your body acts in the interest of the fetus, and as long as the mother is alive it doesn\u2019t care what other havoc it wreaks. \n\nDeciding to submit yourself to a major medical event in which your vagina can tear all the way to your asshole, you can hemorrhage, your hormones do crazy shit, you undergo immense pain, you might have a needle stuck up your spine, you run a significant risk of unplanned surgery, you may suffer permanent injury or bodily changes, and you may die, is a huge decision. Childbirth can also come with significant psychological trauma, both for the person giving birth and others in attendance, often a partner. People brush it off as an afterthought, and frown upon those who cite childbirth as a primary reason for not having kids.",

                                    "comment": "There's way too much in this topic to answer in a single reddit comment.  Thousands of books have been written on this topic.  Billions are spent in marriage counseling every year.  But here's my story.\n \nI watched my older brother go from girl to girl... always chasing that \"in love\" feeling.  I knew better.  I knew that feeling was just chemicals being released in your brain when you saw that person and after 12-18 months, that feeling goes away.  That's why you never get married in the first couple years and you find someone you can commit to, not just be 'in love' with.  I was the smart one... I was supposed to have it all together and figured out.\n \nWhen I met my wife this played out as planned.  We dated for 4 years, decided to get married and things were great until our second kid was born.  Things kinda fell apart after that.\n \nFast forward 10 years and my wife and I are coming out of a very bad stretch.  I almost committed suicide a couple times because of depression caused by the feeling that she just didn't want to be married anymore.  Since I committed to her until death parts us, it seemed like the one thing I had left that I could do for her.  She could go find someone that she could be in love with.  It also does away with messy divorces and sets her and our kids up for life.\n \nSlowly... way too slowly... we started talking and coming out of it.  We saw a few therapists and finally settled on one that's helped us a lot.  So far my takeaways for marriage are: \n \n1) Relationships are like anything else in life.  They don't trend towards the positive on their own.  Your house needs work to stay nice - powerwashing, lawn mowing, maintenance.  Your car needs work - oil changes, car washes, detailing.  Neglecting these small efforts will quickly turn a small job into an overwhelming job.\n \nYour relationship is the same way.  Smiling at them the same way you used to smile when you were 'in love'.  Bringing them flowers or their favorite drink because you were thinking of them.  Constantly thinking about fun things to do that they would like.  I call it working for their good.  Telling them how much you love them all the time.  And most importantly, shepherding your emotions, which will naturally tend to take them for granted and see them as \"just there\" instead of someone you're crazy about.  All of this is super easy in those first 18 months of dopamine addiction but after that, you have to continue to put in the work, even if you don't feel like it.  It's exhausting, especially for an introvert like me... but it's better than digging yourself into a hole and then having to do a lot of work to climb out of it... or worse, digging a hole so deep you can't climb out.\n \n2) The more you focus on what the other person's doing, the less happy you will be.  They're being selfish?  They're being rude?  They're not keeping the house clean enough?  None of that matters.  You KNOW they're not selfish or rude most of the time.  You wouldn't have married them otherwise.  Focus on your attitude, how it might be affecting them, what you're doing or not doing that might help.  A marriage isn't both people giving 50%.  It's both people giving 100%, all the time, no matter what.  Focus on what they're doing right.  You've already chosen to spend your life with this person.  You might as well be happy and in love with them.\n \n3) If a person isn't holding up their end of the marriage, talk about it.  Tell them what you need.  My wife and I waited until we just couldn't get any lower and decided that was the appropriate time to discuss things.  We were scared about how they'd take it but once their reaction couldn't get any worse than things already were, we jumped in with both feet and said things in unkind ways.  I don't recommend doing it that way.  Before marriage, make sure that they can take constructive criticism and make sure that you can as well.\n \nThrough the help of our therapist, we both realized that we weren't behaving in a way that facilitates a good marriage.  She was being selfish and expecting me to solve all of her problems and make her feel like she did in those first 18 months.  Thank God she realized this on her own because it's not something that you can make someone see.  They have to have that realization.  When I stopped doing that, she shut down.  I was putting all of my insecurities on her.  Lots of trauma as a child made me feel worthless and unlovable.  She was proof otherwise and as long as she loved me, everything was ok.  I did what I could to keep her happy but when she stopped being happy, I went back to being worthless.  This is what caused my spiral down into depression.  That's a lot to put on someone.\n \nWhich brings me to #4, start therapy early and keep it going.  If it's just to make sure you stay strong, once a month is plenty.  That outside opinion is invaluable.  They'll show you what you're doing/not doing and how to keep the relationship strong.  If you're already digging a hole, it's really hard to see out of it so finding solutions on your own becomes a lot harder.  Try out different therapists and find one that suits you both.  They don't care if you ditch them for someone else.  They understand that everyone needs the right fit.\n \nI'm sure there's tons more... like I said, lots of books on it.  But the crux of it is, work on yourself, not your partner.",

It\u2019s hard to change something you aren\u2019t aware of. It\u2019s true it\u2019s not real life but we don\u2019t learn everything from real life and no kid looks to their parents and thinks oh that\u2019s what love looks like or success etc. Maybe at certain times in their life but other influences are also inherent.\nThe English seem to create more realistic storyline\u2019s and have more realistic, average looking people in strong character roles. As for reality tv it was great when COVID hit. Although they still had the lighting, professional makeup, hair etc it wasn\u2019t to the usual standard and reality peaked through the camera at times.\nI wonder if the media is behind the annoying saying \u201cand what would that look like?\u201d Everything reduced to imagery and superficiality.",

Serial TV with long story lines has made this a bit better, but I still think it has a massive impact on our self worth and the leniency we afford ourselves and others.",

Especially if you're a clueless teenager who doesn't know any better, and neither do your friends.",

In *Frozen*, like half a dozen characters all tell Anna \"You can't marry someone you just met.\"  No title because spoilers, but another recent princess movie ends without a romantic couple forming at all.\n\nOn TV, *Crazy Ex-Girlfriend* actively undermines rom-com tropes.  It starts out with a \"he's my one true love, it's meant to be\" vibe and then subverts it in all kinds of ways, both hilariously and deadly serious.  The show runner had written some scripts for Hollywood romcoms, and tried to give them new or different endings, and was basically told that the ending has to be the normal expected ending.  So she made CXG, which does *not* have a normal expected ending.",

Porn becomes a huge part, if not the only part, of our sexual expectations.\n\nWhere as, romance, beauty, those things are everywhere. From the moment you start watching cartoons, you get positive messages about these things. They are in all types of media, not one limited genre with a limited purpose like porn is. \n\nAnd you get to see it in real life. People live out their relationships in the real world. No, not every intimate detail, but its still way better than porn.\n\ntl;dr: yes, but porn and sex are still uniquely a problem",

Sometimes that intelligence is a curse cuz they\u2019re smart enough to get into trouble lol. But my 3 of my cats are trained, kind of like a dog would be, and I trained them with snapping my fingers. They\u2019re smart enough to know the difference between when I\u2019m snapping my fingers to call them over to me, or snapping my fingers to tell them to stop doing something bad. They\u2019re smart lil kitty babies, and I love them so much!\n\nOne of my cats (who thinks she\u2019s a dog, and is actually getting paperwork from my psychiatrist and psychologist to be legally recognized as a therapy animal/ESA) sleeps with me in bed every night, and she knows when it\u2019s bed time. She comes and cuddles up right next to me and curls up with me under the covers. Also, anytime I have a panic attack she comes and sits on my chest and REFUSES to leave until I calm down. I also have a chronic back injury, and when I\u2019m hurting really bad she\u2019ll come lay right where the pain is. She just knows. \n\nThey\u2019re such incredibly intelligent and emotional creatures, and I love my kitties so much!",

Cats know this just from their base animal instincts. If you can, try to get one of those running pet water fountains. I guarantee your cat will LOVE it. He will be very well hydrated. And no more making you get up to turn on the faucet! It\u2019s a win-win for you and your kitty! :)",

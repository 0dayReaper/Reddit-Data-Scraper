Looking up how to apply for a passport a couple years ago, the first result is this very official-looking page, that only in fine print mentions \"oh we're not affiliated with the actual passport authority and are just charging a fee to forward your application to them\".\n\nSometimes they aren't even marked as being an ad; they've just baited enough clicks that way and gamed the ranking system enough that they're now the top result even without being an ad.",

The first 2 or 3 listing on every google search will go to paid ad slots if anyone has paid for those key words (which is pretty much every single keyword and combination at this point). So you can confidently assume the first 2 listings on any google search are always going to be ads and start looking below them. \n\nIf it\u2019s people running SEO campaigns to achieve their rankings there is simply nothing to do that\u2019s how the algorithm is designed to work.",

The need to bring back *any* result is higher than the need to bring back the *correct* result. As an example, when I'm searching for something for a specific game, Google now occasionally ignores the game name part of the search term, and instead just recommends results for any game that has something in common. \n\nSo yes, I feel like the quality has massively dropped in the last few years.\n\nEDIT: I've no doubt this is due, in part, because everyone who has a website is trying to play the system to appear in the search results, and there are plenty of articles that have been optimised to death to appear at the top of the rankings, and they have no information on them, so that is a factor as well.",

I used to have many little plugins like that but after seeing a few of them be sold and turned into malware I have been much more careful. Like after The Great Suspender got hit, that was it for me. It's why I got rid of my plugin that made every Amazon link a Smile URL. You are giving someone a lot of leeway here in what they could do to you if they chose to.\n\nI know there are plenty of plugin authors that wouldn't sell their shit or whatever but many would for the right price. The good thing about the one you mentioned for Pinterest is I bet you could take that plugin and copy and code and make your own, assuming you are just using the store version now. That would prevent it from updating later. It's so simple I doubt it would ever break. Same as the Amazon Smile one I mentioned.",

Google is trying to figure out what people actually want when they search those keywords and put them at the top of the list. Google frequently makes changes to the algorithms to try to defeat the tricks that websites use to \"artificially\" get their results to the top.\n\nFor example, it used to be that you could do \"keyword stuffing\" to get to the top. You'd just put as many keywords as possible in your site (sometimes just in the metadata - it wasn't even visible on the page) and that'd make Google rank you higher. Now they've changed it so that Google prioritizes pages that have more text and seem to be more of an \"authority\" on the topic. The result is that today sites are becoming wordy as shit, trying to look like an \"authority\" on a topic. Someone selling pants will have a long history of where pants come from, for instance, or go really long into the political implications of wearing bellbottoms in the 60s. But really, they're just trying to sell pants, and the information may LOOK authoritative, but a lot of the time there's only a bare minimum of research that went into it, and sometimes it's flat-out lies.\n\nIt's kinda disgusting, when you think about it. This race to the top of the Google results has turned the internet into a place where it seems that everyone wants to sell you something. I can't look up the best way to get mice out of my basement without having to shift through thousands of pages that want to sell me mice traps, bait, exterminator services, etc. They'll *look* like they've got useful information there, but then they'll always wind up with a pitch for something and I'll realize they're only motivated to sell me that product, and everything else on the page could be nice-sounding bullshit without any truth behind them. \n\nNo one on the internet is unbiased anymore.",

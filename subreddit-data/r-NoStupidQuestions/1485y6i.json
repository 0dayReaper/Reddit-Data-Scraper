Tuna may be processed and labeled as \"solid\", \"chunked\" (\"chunk\") or \"flaked\". **When tuna is canned and packaged for sale, the product is sometimes called tuna fish (U.S.)**, a calque (loan translation) from the German Thunfisch. Canned tuna is sometimes used as food for pets, especially cats.",

You can find defence quite commonly in Britain in the 1400s.\n\nWords like catalog / catalogue. In Britain, mostly it was catalogue, but you can find catalog in Britain in 1587.\n\nWords like oesophagus esophagus came from spellings like ysophagus. In 1772, Irish writer Thomas Nugent spelled it Esophagus. (Though it was admittedly mostly spelled with an oe.)",

If we use the fresh stuff, it's a tuna sandwich/salad.  \n\nThe term is not universal across the US, by the way.

Dogfish, sunfish, starfish, sailfish, catfish, bluefish, blobfish, rockfish.\n\nTuna fish isn\u2019t a singular species (tuna is a family of species), but maybe it became a common way to refer to multiple species of tuna at once? Like if you\u2019re buying or selling tuna, but not referring to the exact species, just say tuna fish? Maybe? That\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing. It\u2019s perhaps how old timey english speakers referred to tuna broadly. Or how it was referred to in general without specifying exactly which species of tuna. \n\nApparently the word tuna comes from the Greek \u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (thunnus) which means \u2018to rush or dart along\u2019. So, since all the fish in the tuna family general behave / look kinda similar\u2026 tuna fish? \n\nInteresting that we dont say salmon fish though? Even tho there\u2019s multiple species of salmon.",

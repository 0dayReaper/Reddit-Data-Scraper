    "postText": "I have golfed sporadically over the years. I enjoyed it but it was impracticable living in nyc with not a lot of money.  It was an activity I did with friends on vacation-not every vacation. \n\nI am moving to a place where the weather is perfect.  There is a golf course 10 minutes from my new place.  Can I get into the sport and do well to not embarrass myself on the course? Is there opposition to green newcomers on a course, I will take a while on each hole.\n\nEntry to the sport financially is not an issue.  I can afford the gear.",

You absolutely could learn to play a decent game in your 50's.  Put your pride away, take some lessons from a pro and get proper game-improvement clubs fitted.\n\nOr, just do what most guys in their 50's do; They use golf as an excuse to drink beer, smoke cigars and tell dad jokes.  Golf is a sport and a pastime, just up to you how you use it to fit in your lifestyle.",

This was a man who had literally never lost a ball and *always* went straight down the middle.  I'll never forget the look on his face when he teed off and the ball bounced sideways and plopped into a lake.  Never seeing that again (Florida remember) so he took another ball and.... exactly the same bounce straight into the lake.  Priceless.  Forty years of golf, no balls lost.  Three minutes later, down two.",

I relearn how to golf after I don't golf for five or six years a lot of times.\n\nIf you're moving to an area that has a big golf presence like Florida or California or, believe it or not, Michigan (where I live) golf lessons are a dime a dozen.\n\nThe PGA used to sponsor a program called 5 days to play or something like that. Basically, it's a 5-day lesson package that leaves you ready to play by the weekend.\n\nTo answer your question directly- it depends. It depends on your physical shape, your desire to play, if you have a friend that is willing to take you, how big your ego is, all that other stuff.\n\nBut also golf is really fun. I don't play any other sport where I can be frustrated for hours and hate what I am doing and then in one moment make a pure strike of an iron and then all of the sudden I love golf again. \n\nTL:DR; get a lessons package and then play and play and play and play and play and play and play! Get fitted for a game improvement set or just by the Costco one and then get what you really want for your second set.",

That will speed things up. \n\nIf you are a really bad player, it might slow things up, but in my experience, the guys who slow up play the most are the ordinary duffers who act like they are playing the last round of the US Open. Things like taking 45 seconds for a fairway shot, or marking a third putt. Or having both guys in the cart drive to each ball, rather than dropping one guy off and then driving to your ball, so that both of you are ready to hit. \n\nBut there is no reason why you can\u2019t successfully take up the sport in your 50s.",

    "postText": "hey guys, i know most of these are unrealistic in real life now (because most people will probably think you\u2019re a cheesy idiot and this kind of stuff seems to have gone out of style in lieu of current hook up culture and more straightforward raunchiness like mentioning removing underwear, bending someone over against a wall, or hooking up in dirty bathrooms in modern reggaeton and hiphop music, which dont get me wrong is great too, i guess) but as someone a little more old fashioned (closet romantic \ud83e\udd2b) i was just wondering what everyone\u2019s favorite fictional romantic moments from general pop culture are?\n\na couple for me:\n\n- dave franco singing roy orbison\u2019s \u201cyou got it\u201d to emma roberts in the film \u201cnerve\u201d (i have the same leather jacket from that scene \ud83d\ude05 another similar one to this is health ledger singing \u201ccan\u2019t take my eyes off you\u201d to julia stiles in \u201c10 things i hate about you\u201d)\n\n- the bar scene in the film \u201cthe replacements\u201d (keanu reeves is about to leave the bar but then stops himself and goes back and plants one on brooke langton while having his actions being narrated by football greats john madden and pat sumerall)\n\n- the end of \u201csixteen candles\u201d: molly ringwald leaves the church her sister just got married at having had a terrible birthday (everybody forgot it) and sees Jake Ryan (her crush) across the street standing in front of his red Porsche waving at her. he later shares a small birthday cake with her and wishes her a happy birthday.\n\n- \u201cocean\u2019s eleven\u201d: george clooney surprises julia roberts at a dinner table in las vegas and tells he just got out of prison lol and he\u2019s there for her/to get her back even though she\u2019s in a relationship with andy garcia\u2019s character and she\u2019s not very receptive to the idea lol calling him a thief and a liar (clooney: i only lied about being a thief!) lol and also the ending &gt;!when brad pitt picks him up from his second stint in jail and she\u2019s in the backseat of the car (and reveals she still has her wedding ring after all)!&lt;\n\n- the watch from dr. strange: rachel mcadams gifts benedict cumberbatch a jaeger-lecoultre watch with a pretty awesome romantic engraving (\u201ctime will tell how much i love you\u201d) that he carries with him (even though the watch is broken and doesnt work anymore after his accident) as a momento of her, throughout his journey in becoming dr strange.\n\n- john cusack holding up the radio outside ione skye\u2019s window in \u201csay anything\u201d is a classic one too, i guess",

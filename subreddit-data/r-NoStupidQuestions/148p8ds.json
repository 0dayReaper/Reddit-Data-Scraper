Buddy of mine married his highschool gf around 30, so what, 12 years together? Almost immediatly after getting married she changed and I thiiink cheated on him. He was legit ready to move across the country to \"get away from it all\". Told him he leave behind all his friends, his family, his whole life. But the one thing that *would* stick with him is the heartache and bad feeling. They'd in fact worsen. So go out of your way to spend time with friends and family. Find new hobbies, make new memories. This shit sucks, but itll fade.\n\nAlso, for the love of god, dont creep on her socials. I did that, hoping for a \"oh a made a huge mistake, I want him back!\" type of post, but it never game. I'd just scroll and get more and more upset.\n\nYou'll get there, and you'll be stronger for it.",

Perhaps finding a partner who *won't* betray you. \n\nIt's perfectly normal to feel anger and hate after being cheated on, but over time it's better for your long term mental health to let go of those feelings of resentment once you're able to do so.",

Desirable sex is every bit as tempting as a drug addiction.\n\nYou would probably do the exact same thing if the roles were reversed.\n\nHere's how I look at it: she isn't *yours*. You're just getting to spend more time with her than most people. Enjoy it while it lasts. It's gonna leave a big hole when it's gone.",

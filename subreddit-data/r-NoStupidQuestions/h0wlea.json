The media latched onto the tiny column just because of the fact it was in a science mag, and took it as a fact that MSG and Chinese food will give you migraines and make you dizzy when in reality no studies had been done. \n\nSo it was started by an innocent scientist or researcher just sharing a couple anecdotes, then racists and fear mongers used it to push any agenda they had.

I think you'd be considered a little strange if you've never had hot cheetos before. Even people I know who don't like spice in general have at least tried them. \n\nThat being said, it's not exactly considered a culturally important food or anything. It doesn't have any of the same mythos that burgers, steaks, and apple pie have. It's just a common junk food that can be bought basically anywhere.",

My family took a road trip to see my mom\u2019s family in Indiana and we swung by a McDonalds to get lunch. The staff did NOT know what I was taking about when I ordered that sandwich.... truly blasphemous for us spice lovers.",

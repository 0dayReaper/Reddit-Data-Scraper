Thanks and sorry for english mistakes.",

Then you get four weekdays off until you need to work again?\n\nIf so, I would 100% go with option 1. Basically every week would be a single 12 hour work day + 6 hour break in between, with some weeks only being a 6 hour work day on Friday and then a 6 hour work day on Monday the following week.",

I don\u2019t mind working more but the fact that the work is only in the morning too would make my life much easier to manage compared to option 1 where I have opposite shifts. It also includes weekends and holidays for the family but overall less pay.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to decide tbh.",

What is the purpose?  Can they tell you that they need you on any given day so that you never know when your off days are?\n\nI think I would prefer option 1, because you would know when you are working, and you could plan things for your off days without having to worry about checking in.",

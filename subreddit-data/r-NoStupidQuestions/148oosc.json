Employing goon squads to beat up union protesters is part of a free market.  \n\nToday, there are also laws that restrict things like hiring goon squads or undercutting your competition.

Just as you think it's the businesses right to seek out cheaper ways to do things, their primary workforce deserves the right to set, negotiate, and protest wages or work practices they deem reasonable.

In simplest terms, they don't have to work if they don't like the conditions and the union allows them group power to do so and demand change in order for work to start again. If non union workers want to work they can. If unaffiliated drivers want to support the company more than the people getting the same shaft they are then they're allowed to continue working. If you cross the picket line, you allow the company to continue operating longer before they have to negotiate, making you the enemy tho this doesn't change your ability to work. Long into short, if you can't support other workers then continue to fuck them over and support the company, or support the workers and don't do work that the company is offhanding to others so they can continue making money off while short changing their own employees. Doesn't seem hard to understand if you've been on both sides of it\nAddon: youre fucking yourself over by supporting the company over the union. What makes you think if the primary workforce is so pissed off they refuse to work that the company will give you, a rando with no affiliation to them and no long term ties/legal representation, a decent wage for the work you provide.",

For the company it means workers not getting paid or having health coverage, bringing in replacement workers, threatening to cut jobs or move work somewhere else, etc.",

If my body isn\u2019t telling me I\u2019m hungry, but I\u2019ve been up for most of the day without eating, I like to cut up small chunks of apples, extra brown sugar, and milk. Those options sound good though, I might have to try them",

I was down to 200 in January, but got injured at work and now I'm back up :(\n\nwhen I weighed 165 I was in basic training for the military lol. unfortunately i got discharged. that was back in 2019!! I didn't really even start losing weight until maybe around 2021. When through a divorce and tried ending my life.  \n\n\nalso recently I injured my shoulder blades by doing cable chest pulls (idk the correct term for it) really bad which sucks because i also have a bad habit of sleeping on my sides haha \n\nThankfully I am better mentally now and I just got in with my doctor yesterday. I've got a lot of appointments coming up and I just want to get back to where I was in 2019 so I can have another chance at the military, It was my dream as a child :)",

This results in hair loss (telogen effluvium) and muscle wasting so you look and feel more fatty at the same weight. \n\nCollagen protein added to coffee if I can't stomach enough meat/fish in a day. It is flavorless and not slimy, but it isn't a complete protein so it's not a good full substitute.",

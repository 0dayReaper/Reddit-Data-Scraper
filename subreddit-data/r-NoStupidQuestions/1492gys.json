    "postText": "So I\u2019m 26 and working mostly with younger people who are 19-20. They\u2019re chill and all but often drama talks. \n\nOne girl especially. She continuously talks about dating and/or boyfriend that has Instagram and she totally freaks out about him \u2018following\u2019 other women on Instagram (and liking their pictures). To the point, she made a fight with her current boyfriend. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not really into social media. I personally have Reddit, Discord for gaming and Instagram for games and religion stuff.. and that\u2019s it. \n\nMy question to this is, is it normally that people freak out so much about follows and likes? Because - I do not understand the drama behind it.",

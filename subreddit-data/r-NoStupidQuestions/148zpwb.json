My husband would never sleep though\u2026 he gave up his noise machine for me. I gave up TV at night after 11pm for him. Fair enough trade. (The noise machine and the fan both resulted in nauseating migraines constantly, no idea why tv is okay and the constant drone isn\u2019t to my brain. It was torture.)",

If I do not have a soft ambient noise in my room, I either continue thinking about stuff I don't want to think of or have a constant whining in my ears.\n\nThe soft noise and bland chatter from something I have seen a thousand times (South Park, Simpsons, Family Guy for example) is not stimulating enough for me to stay up to watch but it is good enough to still listen too as I fall asleep. \n\nI'll also have the TV on minimum brightness and the sleep timer on so it turns itself off eventually.",

Men can still have value and worth even with no hair, while an ugly woman is often told to just go kill herself.  Read any social media if you don't believe me.",

Also, everyone seems to really be making it out like alopecia made Jada less beautiful which is not true at all! I understand it would be very hard to lose your hair to alopecia but damn does she pull off short hair well!",

Women are expected to have long pretty hair. It's the same thing as calling someone weak or puny, not a massive insult to a woman (sometimes a flirt) but very insulting to a man because men are expected to be strong. Women are expected to have nice hair hence the sensitivity with baldness.\n\nIt's not really that hard when you think about it",

When I have a full head of hair, I'm told I look 'professional', 'nonthreatening' and 'pretty'. Strangers are friendly and even flirtatious. When my bald spots start showing, strangers recoil from me. When it spreads and I shave my head, strangers treat me with pity. When I wear a scarf, strangers act scared of me. When I wear a nice wig, I go broke. When I wear a hat or an affordable wig I'm told I look unprofessional. I have grown envious of bald men, because it seems like men's appearances affect their lives much less. I wish I could just be ugly in peace.",

It was pretty heart wrenching to go with her to her doctors &amp; hold her hand while she got her shot. I always thought she was so strong. Not just because of that but I was in gymnastics &amp; so was she but she was SO good, competing in nationals &amp; was on track for the Olympics (much better than I). Alopecia stopped all that. Once her spots were noticeable &amp; it was just getting worse, she dropped out of gymnastics, completely. I know it broke her. It made me so sad to see her lose her dream before we were even in HS.",

I used to have long, wavy thick hair my entire life and now it's gone (for now).\n\nI have noticed a lot of people treat me different when I just walk around with my shaved head. It finally looks buzzed now and not bald. People make less eye contact and smile less and I don't have men hitting on me anymore when I don't wear my wig. And I agree it's frustrating to feel like I have to wear one to look professional.  \n\nI also don't like wearing certain head caps/wraps, even when running errands, because I don't want to look like I have/had cancer. This is a personal preference for myself, as I don't care what other people like to wear.\n\nI hope our society begins to accept and normalize all genders having any hairstyle they want. Whether being bald or having really long hair for any gender.\n\nI have had fun playing around with the masculinity/femininity of the look. Playing around with bold make-up and earrings,  and I recently got some new piercings. \n\nI honestly thought Jada looked beautiful at the award ceremony rocking her natural look (without getting into the politics of the situation).",

I'm a fit male,with what i'd say above avg shoulder length which gets emphasized even more with bald/buzzed head.And considering my beard isn't that well filled, i shave it so i'm kinda skinhead looking. So ya, as a male you do look more threatening when buzzed, at least that's my personal experience. Tho I noticed some women go for that kind of look,others are just plain scared. I've been even thinking of going all out in my look, and getting tatoos :D\n\nOh and i noticed you asked smth about scalp itch, i have that too. Try DS shampoos ,usually can be found in pharmacy.I suffer dermatitis (redness and itch, followed by scales) which gets relieved by both buzzing and shampoos and cremes for it. I had it on scalp, and sometimes on my nose/eyebrows. Nizoral was for me too drying, you could try it if you buzz your hair to 0 and then put on Lipikar Baume AP then you won't have the dryness issues but i still recommend DS shampoo and DS cremes if you have issue elsewhere.  Kinda expensive, but it's a life saver for me.",

Men's appearances aren't ignored, but women's appearances are much more emphasized in terms of their overall value as a person. So anything that makes a person uglier (by mainstream standards) is going to be more emotionally impactful for all but a small portion of women who have evaded this pressure and a small portion of men who have adopted a similar centrality of beauty. Losing your hair might lower physical attractiveness for both men and women equally (not sure if that's even true) but there's generally less at stake, socially for men.",

I\u2019ve been bald AF since I was 22. So I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just jarring to see people act like 1 this was never accepted behaviour and also 2 \u201cwell your a guy so it\u2019s not much of a stigma to be bald\u201d\n\nNah yeah, not like people rip your hat off, call you bald, gross, ugly, and when you ask them to stop they just do it more. Or when you try to explain to your friend group that making fun of balding is no better than making fun of someone for being fat and they in turn double down on the jokes because they disagree. Having to wear a hat every day because you lived you life long enough to know that your guaranteed to get harassed if you take it off.\n\nGuys can\u2019t even wear wigs, like are we gonna pretend toupees haven\u2019t been the universally mocked for ages? I wore a wig once for Halloween, I thought hey, I can get away with it! Nope. Ripped off my head, bald head pointed out, wig tossed into a puddle. \n\nIn short: as someone whose been almost entirely bald for the past several years, Im gonna have to say it\u2019s a double standard. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lot that genuinely feel it\u2019s crappy to make fun of, but fat chance convincing me most of the planet changed their opinion on this over night.",

                    "comment": "Agreeing this is the root of the answer. It\u2019s about how hair loss affects the status, value, social standing, and limitations of women vs. men. Hair is deeply tied to looks for women and looks are deeply tied to women\u2019s value and what opportunities they might have in life. Quick example is just the math on what women can spend on salon and dying hair. It\u2019s sticker shock to most men who aren\u2019t aware. \n\nI think a bigger principle here is that people are more sensitive to the things that change their ability to access needs or wants. And along with that, our brains do a lot of unwritten social calculus on those things in any given moment. We\u2019re evaluating proportion of harm in milliseconds based on a combination of ideas that aren\u2019t always articulated or measured against each other on paper. We can get this wrong based on unawareness of people\u2019s experiences, but the group tends to measure this together when there\u2019s a reaction. We feel it first and explain it second. \n\nSo, baldness for a man can limit him in ways that do hurt, and it\u2019s not right to make fun of. But then the social impact is less and many men make fun of their own baldness even to either cope or because they are okay enough that it doesn\u2019t have same sting. Baldness or hair thinning in women is something that\u2019s only whispered and considered too mean to even mention.",

If you look at how many hair and eyelash products there are targeted at women than men they are completely outweighed. Plus there is a large amount of men who choose to shave their head so I guess it\u2019s a lot more commonly accepted to see men with no hair whereas not many women shave their head. There are also other symptoms than hair loss with alopecia that you don\u2019t get with baldness. A lot of it has to do with societal norms and pressure on how women should look whereas it\u2019s more \u201cacceptable\u201d to see a man without hair.",

Men have insecurities about their looks but are much less likely to suffer professionally or socially if others perceive them as unattractive. Then there's the fact that baldness is largely associated with masculinity. And, aside from the social policing that demands women be \"attractive\" there's an added layer that prohibits them from being \"masculine.\" TLDR: historically, a bald woman has had much more chance of being ostracized or missing out on opportunities just because of her baldness than a bald man does (not to mention one is a disease and the other is not)",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nSo I was thinking about how old Reddit is, launched back in 2005, it has amassed 1.66 billion (2023). So that means that since its inception it has been hoarding and storing, forums, funny comment threads, loads of links, pictures,  videos, and countless sub reddits.   \n\n\nNow I do have some knowledge in SWE (Software Engineering) and data analytics. So I am thinking they are using Databases, and creating algorithms to handle such loads. Reddit probably paired up with AWS(Amazon Web Services)  to store their data. \n\nBut does that mean they will continue to hoard all this information? will they ever just end up wiping it clean?",

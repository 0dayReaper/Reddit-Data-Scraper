I\u2019m almost done with med school and really wondering if I would allow my kids to do the same thing at this point. Almost nobody from my high school went to college, and I know many friends are now in their late 20s in trades or small businesses clearing 100k. And I\u2019m sitting here with nearly 350k in debt (and that\u2019s after a scholarship to college, working mostly full time since 16. Damn med school tuition and losing all my damn money to rent in an expensive city). Going into a low paying specialty so I\u2019m never going to be the classic \u201crich doc\u201d. I love my job but unless it\u2019s a passion I tell everyone I know to find another career in a heartbeat.\n\nI feel even worse for my friends who went to college purely because they were force-fed the myth that college is the only option if you did average or above in HS and are in fields that will never pay more than a trade. Hell even my college buddies in finance think their hot shit but my neighbors from the boonies have way more assets than them.",

My granddad was a carpenter and his knees are non existant at this point. My dad was an electrician and he has several bridged vertebre in his back (though a lot of the damage was caused by a bad wreck), Im nearing 25, and Ive been a mechanic for about 4 years, and specializing in semi trucks for 3 now. I can already feel my body taking its toll, but Im adapting how I work to mitigate the damage unlike my fathers. Hearing in my right ear is noticeably less sharp, so Ive started wearing ear plugs at work. I regularly practice proper lifting as even just our brake drums easily clear 100lbs each. I try to keep my back as straight as possible as I work, bending at the waist, knees, or even just propping my chest on something to hold me up as opposed to hunching over, etc.. \n\nI know eventually my body is going to break down regardless, but I couldnt enjoy my life behind a desk or wearing a suit and tie. I have a blast doing what I do. None of us make it out alive and Id rather have a body that tells stories of my life.",

For some people higher education is absolutely the right decision and they would hate working in a trade while for others trades can be very lucrative and fulfilling work without the cost of a four year degree.

He went out west a couple times to help with their forest fires, but from what he's said, the western state governments were absolute cheapskates that didn't want to pay for their travel costs or anything. It sounds like they basically wanted free help courtesy of New England. \n\nI'm not sure if that's because they were already used to using low-cost prison labor and were balking at paying professional wages - or if their unwillingness to pay professionals is why they resorted to using prison labor. But either way, it's pretty terrible.",

I have a lot of education but it's very foolish and shortsighted to start with an assumption that janitors or maintenance workers or whatever are just obviously in those jobs because they're unable to do something else. There are lots of reasons to do janitorial or maintenance work, including not only that it can pay better than other professions, but that it can be much less stressful than other jobs (compare it to being a teacher, for example, and holy shit I would so much rather be a janitor, especially right now). And to go along with that lack of stress is what I think is probably having an easier time detaching from your job and enjoying your spare time. People with more demanding jobs can sometimes feel like there is no such thing as spare time.",

Despite that, after all bonus incentives and sales targets have been calculated, I still make less than the ones I coordinate, who have next to no idea about what it is they are selling.\n\nThat is simply because a lot of people selling a lot of computers appears to have more of a direct impact to the company's progress than my input or advice does when it affects sales deals, at least in the minds of higher-ups. I would argue that my advice and input is just as much the deciding factor in securing a multi-million deal as is the salesperson's ability to negotiate it, but if I told that to management they would shrug it off as if I were talking nonsense.\n\nIt is what it is. I am considering asking for a sizeable raise though, since they have been actively trying to pin more duties on me lately in a very nonchalant manner.",

Government could probably pay for everyone to have a decent accomodation as well.\n\nAlso it's not that difficult to reach full employment these days either, in fact labour shortage is more of a problem in many countries, than unemployment.\n\nSo, why is personal debt so high these days? Couldn't minimum wage be rather higher? Some companies don't make that much profit so they would suffer but you could argue they should be allowed to just fail, although it creates some more unemployment, something more efficient will come along and pay more.\n\nPoverty really is a failure of government in these times, of course the right wing blame society for it instead.",

From the perspective of an employer, a masters is just indicative of more experience than that of a bachelors. The general personal qualities a degree helps build, and thus acts as a token to demonstrate those skills, you also get from working.(discipline, research, teamwork, working under pressure etc; core skills, analysis and evaluation, and the general processes of constructing and completing challenging new work efficiently, demonstrated learning and application of knowledge)\n\nNaturally, assuming a masters takes an extra year, i'd tend to find that someone with a bachelors who spends that year doing work, while perhaps not their preferable career choice, will at least be on equal footing after one year, versus someone who has done a masters, as most of the value of the degree comes from the Bachelors, the masters is just one extra deciding factor of increased experience over someone who doesn't have one.\n\nThat said, there are also plenty of other ways to bolster experience and personal development outside of academia directly, though this is certainly far easier to fill from engineering style degrees, where you can develop your own projects to bolster out experience.  \n\nSo you should soon be in a great place, and likely able to access more opportunities, good luck :)",

In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a job\u2014any job\u2014can be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 an hour?\n&gt;\n&gt; To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly \"unskilled,\" that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort. She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you int to live indoors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity\u2014a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Read it for the smoldering clarity of Ehrenreich's perspective and for a rare view of how \"prosperity\" looks from the bottom. You will never see anything\u2014from a motel bathroom to a restaurant meal\u2014in quite the same way again.\n\nBut get it from the library or local book store if you can avoid amazon-- they're one of the worst offenders in terms of labor, and putting local stores out of business.",

And a lot of things have limited utility.  You're not going to rush out and buy 3 more toothbrushes just because you can afford them.  You're not going to hire a plumber if you don't need one just because you could afford it.\n\nThe increase in demand will be only for items that the lower working class wanted but which were just out of their reach previously.  Meanwhile, the bargain bin items they had to buy before would see less demand, since now they can buy the slightly more expensive item.  That would drive these prices down.\n\nSo some things would go up, some would go down, it would not be across the board, and it would not be proportional.  Overall, the working class would be better off.  More mid-level items would sell, stimulating the economy.  And prices for the things really poor people buy would decrease, making their lives easier as well.",

I spent my 20s landscaping, which didn't afford me a luxurious life but allowed me to save enough money to spend winters abroad, and then I always had a good (not great) job to return to when I came home. Rarely was there overtime (and if it was, like an hour tops), I could listen to music, the crew were always made up of cool folks, and I got to spend my days working the earth in the outdoors, staying in shape, and putting my own small touch into beautifying my city. I loved it, and needed nor wanted nothing more.\n\nThat being said, I couldn't imagine how shit my life would be if I treated that job like it was my fate rather than something that allowed me to pursue what I really wanted to do, if I had spent ALL of my 20s landscaping instead of 3/4 of it landscaping and 1/4 of it traveling. My job was a means to an end, not the end in itself. I think more people need to adopt that mentality, whether the end is travel, time for creative pursuits, or putting clothes on your children's back. Unless you aspire to a \"higher calling\" (ie: surgeon or congressperson or CEO), then your job should *always* be a means to an end, not the end in itself.\n\nThat's just, like, my opinion, man!",

The issue here is first of all, there is WAY too much emphasis on the fact that people need a college degree. Trade schools are a wonderful thing - there are people who work long, arduous hours, come home smelling terrible, and are extremely happy.\n\nWith that said, going to college had a specific purpose years ago, which was in simple terms to become formally educated in order to be \u2018qualified\u2019 to be in a certain position (such as a teaching degree or an engineering degree). When the government took over student loans back in the 70s-80s, that was when college became less of a place for formal education and more of a business. Moreover, going to college does NOT in any capacity guarantee a \u201cbetter\u201d paying job. It may give you a few more opportunities, but if you get a degree that is only useful in a very niche area, you should expect to have a limited number of options. And, to the point of government takeover, you\u2019ll still be in debt just from the way that the loans are designed as well as how much college tuition has gone up in the last 40 years.",

Barely.   \n\n\nI wish I couldve found work. I was passionate about it, since it was something active i could do that involved science. I was encouraged by everyone to go into the field. But there was nothing. People at the time were talking about a military port in Nova Scotia that would be built, bring bunch of jobs. I dont know if that ever went anywhere.   \n\n\nThe worst part was, the day before the final exam. When I had an epiphany and realized it was all Pythagorean theorem. I felt robbed after the job search, having to go back to minimum wage. To go back home another year. With the knowledge that I couldve googled if I tried hard enough and no reward. Just a credential I wouldnt feel comfortable flexing now.",

(who cares about them)\n\nSee, there's this argument that 'humans are inherently greedy' that people use to discredit UBI, but I feel like it's the opposite; humans are inherently greedy so they *won't be satisfied* with the bare minimum *and* will have *more* of their income to spend on things that stimulate the economy like shopping and entertainment.  We like to imagine an unfortunate 'neckbeard' living in his mom's basement and flipping burgers, but if that dude had his own place and fewer bills, he'd be spending all that money he saved on, idk, computer parts, or maybe even \"bettering\" himself if he wanted to.  People who've spent years as a cashier would maybe open a small business or go back to school.

In fact, that margin is the amount of money the rich person gets. If automation removes a human workforce, then the rich are exploiting society (their consumers) for profit, without adding any value to society themselves.",

I don't personally consider IT white collar but we should be beyond the point where service industry means shit pay. More to the point we need to stop the notion that jobs like CPA or CEO mean making 5-10x what literally everyone else makes.\n\nMost importantly we need to get past the notion that \"traditional\" college is the only or best way. Four year university degrees aren't the norm except the last 50 years, not even the entire time the United States has existed. Traditional education beyond primary school, meaning up to what we now call 6th grade, is actually apprenticeships and trade schools. There's not a damn thing wrong with going to trade schools, vocational education, apprenticeships and community college that focuses on useful education in infrastructure requirements for modern society to continue.",

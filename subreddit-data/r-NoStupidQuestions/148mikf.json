    "postText": "We've had our inside only cat for almost two years now, we got him when he was 3mos old. He's been the only pet We've had. My husband has found a small inside dog he is wanting to get for our son. How should we introduce them or go about it? I don't want my cat feeling betrayed and he's more my cat than anybody. Will they usually be able to tolerate each other? I've only ever had cats and dogs outside to where they had plenty of yard etc to separate.",

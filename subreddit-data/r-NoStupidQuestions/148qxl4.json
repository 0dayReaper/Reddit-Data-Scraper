I was very surprised when someone I considered a close friend did this to me because she\u2019d seemed like a good person, so it didn\u2019t make sense to me that she\u2019d do this and see nothing wrong with it.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just explained by the people who do this being inconsiderate / not caring about their friends feelings, because that doesn\u2019t explain why they become interested in the partners or exes of friends again and again. Is it some sort of power thing?",

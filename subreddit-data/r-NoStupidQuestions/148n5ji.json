It's not weird, but pointing the finger at other people is....well, it's not about them.\n\nI'm sure you have *some* experience. I'm not judging you but get out and have that wild sexual experience. That is obviously lacking. An experience that makes your socks fly off. The kind that will make you understand why people talk about it. Why most of the world is comfortable with it but Americans are not.",

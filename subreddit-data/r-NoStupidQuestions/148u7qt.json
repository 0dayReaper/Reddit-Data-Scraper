Plus, there\u2019s a potential public policy argument that letting this type of technical crime slip by encourages victims to enlist third parties (that aren\u2019t law enforcement) to \u201csteal\u201d back their property and potentially cause more trouble with those additional crimes I mentioned\n\nPersonally, I think a prosecutor would proceed with charges in that cases regardless of intentions, simply because the act was performed and they can prove it (which is all you really need for robbery). That said, if it was a case where no other crimes were committed and the original victim was satisfied with the recovery of the item, I could see a prosecutor potentially deciding not to press charges",

Are we talking about drug dealers or gang leaders? Not all drug dealers are gang leaders or in a gang, most aren't. As far as the stupidity of drug dealers, I can agree with you on that. I've seen junkies arguing with the judge for their drugs back, offering to do jail time to get them instead of probation. I've also seen dealers call the police because someone broke in and stole their drugs. But most of the time nothing happens. Drugs get stolen, they don't know who did it and they know they can't do anything about it except hide them better next time. Most drugs dealers aren't violent and definitely not murderers.",

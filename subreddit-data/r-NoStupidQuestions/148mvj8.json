    "postText": "A few months ago i noticed one of my antique pocket watches, made from a patent alloy that i assume mainly contains nickel, was stuck to the desk with a green residue that had formed on the back, i thought nothing of it and that my mother might have sprayed something on it that reacted, but today i pick up a stainless steel fountain pen that i haven't used in a while and it's covered in this disgusting brownish/greenish stuff that's sticky, out of curiosity i pick up a nickel plated watch i haven't worn in a while and while it's not as advanced as the other stuff, there's also brown coffee-like stains on it, partly on the front glass too and some green dots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this stuff is on the left hand side of my desk, but some things seem impervious to it or have only a got a mild case of this strange corrosion, silver seems impervious, so does plastic/resin, a metal clock winding key also seems completely unaffected, my modern stainless steel pocket watch is unaffected and a nearby antique watch with a patent metal case seems to only have blackened and toned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is going on here? why is some steel and nickel containing items developing these strange spots/stains and corrosion? it doesn't look like it would come off easily and almost looks like a kind of corrosion or mold, i asked my mother if she's been spraying anything on my desk and she said no, some other steel items have also developed werid dirt-like stuff as well, it's almost like a disease that's infecting all my stuff.",

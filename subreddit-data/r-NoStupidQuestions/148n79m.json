As the prof, I\u2019m the person in charge of the class, and that means I do have some legal liability for the people in the class and to the college. As far as the college is concerned, I\u2019m letting you \u201csteal the class\u201d even though you arent getting credit for it.  Also, the college has liability for people on its campus, like if you slip and fall\u2026 even if you\u2019re NOT paying for the course. It\u2019s my legal obligation and part of my contract to kick your ass out if you\u2019re not on my roster. \n\nNOW WILL ALL FACULTY DO THIS OR CARE? No, obviously, of course not.  However, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we\u2019re \u201csupposed to\u201d  \n\nAlso, please ignore all the people above saying \u201cof course you can\u201d or it\u2019s calling \u201cauditing\u201d.  It is possible to audit a class, HOWEVER you still pay for the class - no, one doesn\u2019t get credit, and it is nearly always cheaper, but auditing students are NOT just people wandering in \u201ctaking the class\u201d. They are full on students that are choosing to not receive credit for the course, whatever their reasons.",

    "postText": "Okay so I was looking through my old messages and someone I used to message on Facebook had blocked me years ago(2015). I\u2019ve been blocked ever since. But today I saw it said \u201cmessage request\u201d In small font above his name. And when I click on our messages it shows only the messages we had sent each other before he blocked me. The last photos we had sent to each other now is blocked out and says \n\u201cimages sent in message requests are covered. Tap to see blurred images\u201d \n\nIt was never like that before. Does that mean he unblocked me at some point and tried messaging me? And then blocked me once again? \n\n*our message conversation was never at one point in \u201cmessage requests\u201d it\u2019s always been in my normal chats*",

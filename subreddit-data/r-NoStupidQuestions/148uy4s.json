    "postText": "My boyfriend is a DoorDasher. He was driving and got a ping for an order and looked down at his phone. He was crossing a street and didn\u2019t see the car driving perpendicular to him (before or after looking down at his phone). The other driver T-boned him and hit his back bumper. My boyfriend knows it was his fault and takes full responsibility.\n\nMy question is about insurance, just because I don\u2019t know anything about getting into an accident and getting tickets and filing claims or how all that works. The other driver was speeding (don\u2019t know how much over the limit), so I\u2019m just curious if that could effect anything?\n\nWhat I\u2019m thinking about is similar to the tailgating law: if someone rear ends another person, they\u2019re automatically at fault because they were driving too close. Had they left enough space in between their cars, they could\u2019ve stopped before hitting them. Would that at all be applicable in this case? The other guy was speeding, so had he been doing the speed limit, maybe there would\u2019ve been enough time to brake?\n\nAgain, I\u2019m quite inexperienced with stuff like this so anyone with knowledge/similar experience that could help enlighten me is appreciated.",

            "comment": "Okay so a couple of things \n\n1. Your insurance company is only concerned with who\u2019s at fault. If your boyfriend stated he was at fault and informed insurance of this then it\u2019s case closed \n\n2. Speeding could help but it depends on the situation. It would need to be notated on a police report so that it can be proven outside of that it\u2019s just hearsay and will be dismissed. \n\n3. The tailgating thing is a myth there are situations in which a rear end can be the fault of the car in front. \n\nA lot of people think that car insurance companies are detectives looking for the facts or open to other details. They are not. They just want the easiest determination so they can cut a check and move on.",

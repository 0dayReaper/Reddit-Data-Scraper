Thank you for your recommendations and all that\n\n\n\nThe Last time I talk to my friend was 3 days ago but if I call him or text him he\u2019s usually answers and if he can\u2019t answer the call, he usually text me saying that he can\u2019t call. This is very out of the usual with him, and I asked my other friends that know him and they said that they haven\u2019t talk to him since I did and I\u2019m getting a little worried I\u2019ve known this dude since sixth grade, so what should I do? Also, my messages aren\u2019t delivering they are not green, but they aren\u2019t delivering either it\u2019s just blank under the messages. So please help me and thank you for your help.",

I've been struggling to brush my teeth consistently these days and I realized I have enough energy to do it when I first wake up, but by anything around dinner I'm completely out of it and don't have the energy to do even things I enjoy, much less brush my teeth and other important adult tasks. So, is there any reason that brushing one's teeth \\*has\\* to occur at bedtime instead of in the morning? I know both would be ideal, but we're starting reasonably here...",

            "comment": "I used to struggle with brushing my teeth but in September i got braces so i knew i had to brush my teeth more frequently. I bought an electric toothbrush that has a timer. First, you dont have to do that back and forth and circles on the teeth so fast/hard?? since the toothbrush does it for you. Second, my toothbrush indicates me when 30 secs has passed so its time to change \u201csections\u201d. You basically divide your mouth in 4 parts and every 30 secs you switch to an other side. I also force myself to not think about it so it feels quicker. It\u2019s made brushing my teeth a lot more fun and easy. Ofc in the beginning i was still struggling but it becomes an habit after a while and its just incorporated in my schedule. Example: I take showers at night so right after i took my shower i brush my teeth. You got this OP. Personal hygiene can be difficult for some people and I hope it gets better\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nEdit to add: After every meal i drink some water and i brush my teeth right after. I feel like drinking water kind of helps to get rid of the taste/food particules",

Might not be ideal but reasonable is better than nothing - all the best.",

For instance, if I searched \"ducks\" on youtube, the first three results are something duck related, but then the next several results are based off of previous searches I had or vids I may be interested in that may have absolutely nothing to do with ducks. So infuriating. Give me ducks or give me death.\n\n\nEdit: holy duck, this blew up a bit. lol sorry guys, I was just using ducks as an example and am not intensively looking for ducks videos but I appreciate you guys sending 'em my way!\n\nI was just pointing out that youtube is kind of butt when it comes to their searches. Even typing specifically in detail what you're looking for in there brings up a bunch of stuff that may be relevant to the user overall, but not always relevant to what the user is searching in the query. You gotta sift through a lot of \"recommended\" videos to get to the good stuff.",

Even a good chunk of OEM game controllers turn out to be knock offs. Along with razor blades, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, and damn near everything else you can think of.\n\nI asked a question once about an rc car I was buying for the kids on Xmas last year. The seller answered my question and completely lied. I bought the rc car. It was junk. Also came with a piece of paper saying if you left them 5 stars they would automatically send you a free 2nd battery pack. Left a bad review and explained why.\n\nI was almost immediately contacted by email from them. Offered to send me a 2nd battery, refund me my money, and let me keep the car if I would remove my review.\n\n If that's not buying your ratings I don't know what is.\n\nSo I said ok, I'd delete the review after I got the refund and the battery. They delivered. I didn't.\n\nLike 4 months later they offered me an Amazon credit of $30 if I would remove my review, and I agreed. Got the $30.\n\nReview's still up.\n\n*thanks for all the UPS and rewards. Since this received so much attention I thought I'd throw in a great informative podcast episode from [Reply All, called \"the magic store\"](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/brhow4). It goes into great detail about how and why Amazon became the train wreck that it is.",

Having made use of such \"resources\" in the past, I bounced around one help desk to the next as the only assistance they could provide was to offer other numbers to call in a never-ending loop. Nobody thought to verify if it was possible to actually talk to someone. Friends, family, and reddit falls into the same practice of kicking the proverbial can down the road by suggesting help is actually available.\n\nFinally finding the \"forbidden knowledge\" I was searching for became a moment of catharsis and alleviated much of my anxiety in regards to my own death. Still, attempts to help others achieve the same satisfaction is \"frowned upon\" and replaced with \"just call this number\" rhetoric.\n\nAnywho, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

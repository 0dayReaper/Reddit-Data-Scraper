    "postText": "I need photos from the Stonewall riots for a promo of a drag show. It's a small one, so even the most rainbow capitalist of rainbow capitalism likely wouldn't care, but I don't want to test my luck too much. I found one that was actually from a different protest by Leonard Fink which was taken in 1971 so it had a 28 year copyright which was automatically renewed for 67 years [(according to an image restoration company)](https://imagerestorationcenter.com/copyright-laws-on-old-photos/) and it's not like I can ask the photographer since he died, but since he died before the automatic renewal I wouldn't be shocked if that changed anything. We aren't making a ton of money but we are not a non-profit either.",

Tell you exactly how to credit the image and what the licensing restrictions are, if any (for instance sometimes they are 100% free to use, sometimes there are restrictions on commercial activity, etc.). edit: Also found pexels.com",

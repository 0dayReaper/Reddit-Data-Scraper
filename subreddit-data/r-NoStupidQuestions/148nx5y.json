If you take it again and get an A, you'll still have the prior F, so it will be the equivalent of taking it twice and getting a C both times (0 + 4 / 2 = 2).\n\nIf you don't take it again, you may not have enough science credits to satisfy the entry requirements at your future college/university.",

I never took high school bio, but going off what I remembered from 7th grade life science I was able to remember enough to pass the final exam.\n\nOn top of that, if you ace it you could use the extra GPA bonus points for it being an AP class to compensate for your chemistry grade.\n\nIf all else fails, remember \"**D**\" is for \"**D**iploma\"  *and* \"**D**on't look back\"",

In elementary school pretty much everyone recited it and it probably did look culty but I didn\u2019t notice.

I went along with it, not really thinking about it, until maybe sophomore year when I started to find it cringy and weird. I started off by standing but just not saying it, which nobody seemed to notice but was my little private form of resistance. By senior year I no longer stood for it; I'd just doodle or play Tetris on my graphing calculator. This got their attention, and the teacher would glare at me. After a week or two, he held me after class to ask if I could at least respect the pledge by standing. I told him I'd think about it (I guess I didn't have the balls to say no to his face). The next day I went back to sitting and playing Tetris, and despite frequent glares, it was never brought up again.",

I refused. I thought he was insane and creepy. Everyday he would ask me to recite the pledge, and I refused. He was getting more agitated as the days went on and he then said he would fail me if I didn\u2019t recite it the next day. I refused again. The teacher called my Dad, who had no idea what was going on, and told him he was going to give me an \u201cF\u201d. My Dad wasn\u2019t upset, but pleaded with me to cooperate. I said absolutely not, I am not budging. My Dad called him back, and that was the end of it. The teacher picked at me the rest of the year, but he looked like the asshole. I am extremely patriotic, but I am not a psychotic Nationalist. I am a realist who thinks acknowledging our nation\u2019s flaws and working to solve them will make our citizens happier, our country stronger. The Pledge of Allegiance is a Nationalistic piece of propaganda garbage. Don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cunder God\u201d part. It\u2019s unconstitutional.",

Most stand, but I let them know at the beginning of each year that no teacher or administrator can force them to stand or say the pledge. Our district administration observed some classrooms and witnessed students refusing to stand or say the pledge, then tried to tell us teachers that we have to make the students stand and say the pledge. That didn\u2019t go over well... I can\u2019t believe there are teachers out there that actually try and punish students for not saying the pledge. Funny thing is... there is no pledge during distance learning and I\u2019m pretty sure not a single person has even thought about it or complained.",

My school had the pledge of allegiance AND military propaganda that we had to watch every day for 15 minutes after lunch masked in some cutesy \u201cteen news show\u201d.

People did give me odd looks and sometimes made comments. I was never punished for it by teachers.",

I can\u2019t recall if there was anyone who explicitly got in trouble for not doing it, but I think the teachers wanted you to at least stand up for it if you didn\u2019t want to say the words. Also similar to other commenters, it was coupled with a moment of silence (maybe around 30 seconds or so)\n\nYes 100% very culty but only if you think about it directly. In the moment it felt very normal and routine. Same as listening to the national anthem before sporting events",

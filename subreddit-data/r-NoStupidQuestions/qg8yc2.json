            "comment": "This is a complicated question. Let me first start by sayin that most of the ultra wealthy have wealth through assets, either physical property or stock ownership NOT through income. When we say Musk is worth 200B, most of that is assets. His liquid wealth, while still substantial, is likely much much smaller, maybe a few hundred million. You also must understand that money is not the same to the wealthy as it is to us. Money for them is a tool used to create more wealth. Anything which diminishes that tool must be minimized in order to maximize the usefulness of the tool. Basically we have a few motivating factors here, one is the desire to sustain a lavish lifestyle utilizing a much smaller amount of liquid assets, so paying 25% of 300 million will actually lower their ability to own all those fancy houses and yachts and rub elbows with politicians and officials. Second, is the desire to utilize wealth to productively to make more wealth. While a few million less may not be substantial, those few million may be worth 10x or 100x if properly invested, so the pain of that tax is many times multiples. Third the desire to avoid taxes on assets which is a whole separate discussion around property rights, but when 98% percent of your worth is in assets, you sure don\u2019t want that to happen.",

Break up their oligopolies, unionize every workplace, tax them at 70-90+% above a mil income, progressive wealth tax above 50 mil, put the earnings toward infrastructure, education, healthcare, housing, and green transition. It's really not this difficult, and their admitting themselves that the money beyond a certain point is functionally meaningless to their lifestyles. So let's stop enabling their small dick energy pursuits at immortality and put their capital to use for once - the way they always promised capitalism was supposed to work.",

Im South African.\n\nWe pay income tax, 35% levy on fuel price and 15% VAT on all purchases.\n\nThis covers the entire population. If youre middle class or wealthy in south Africa you can between 18% to 36%.\nIf you earn under a certain threshold you dont have to pay income tax.\n\nThe fuel levy is mandatory. \n\nVAT is charged on all purchases whether your 5 years old or  55 years old, a Billionaire or Homeless you pay VAT.\n\nThe problem is our government is corrupt, a kleptocracy and generslly inept. Over msny years Billions of Rands have gone missing or were stolen. Every year hundreds of millions of tax payer money is misappropriated. Ministers openly embezzle and steal tax payer money.\n\nNearly every minister has been linked to a scandal or crime. Stolen funds or using government  or state assets to inrich themselves and not a single person has been or will be held accountable.\n\nHundreds of Billions of tax money is collected by the government yearly but the majority is always misappropiated, mispent, used to replace money that was stolen or generally doesnt do anything for the nations infrastructure, schools or people in general that its supposedly meant for, or rather the bare minimum is done.\n\nSo if i were a Billionare. I wouldnt be eager to give my money to the Sputh African government. Id rather burn it tbh.",

You'd be the one recieving the money that was meant to go towards infrastructure. Same as in the USA. \n\nYou wouldn't be thinking of burning your tax money if you were a billionaire. You'd be thanking your government buddy for commissioning your company's services on paper, while massively overcharging to do nearly nothing, so you can pocket the taxes of the working class. Then you write-off the income as government-sponsored and pay no tax on it.\n\nThis is the same logic trap that a lot of US citizens fall into when they hear about raising taxes. \"When I'm rich in a few years, I don't want to pay more.\" they think. The same elite class lobbying for lower taxes for the rich because it will \"trickle down\" into your hands, those people are pocketing the tax you pay while loopholing themselves out of paying their already low tax rate.",

They believe that they are better equipped to decide how that money is spent, that they are more intelligent than their government (most rightly so, where the latter is concerned). There is also the fact that when you're ultra wealthy money isn't a currency used to acquire goods, it is a way to bend the world to your will. Money is used as clout, as branding (charitable giving, which is double fun given the tax benefit), as a means to ensure laws are passed in your favor and further secure your business/industry/legacy is protected for your lifetime and your heirs'. The ability to take as much power as you can transcends the dollars.  My work is with the ultra wealthy. It is a totally different mindset. A total contrast to my life outside of work, but fascinating to have a view into.",

I'm a CPA and used to do taxes for millionaires.\n\nClients would often ask me to do, or overlook, greasy stuff. Most often in the form of \"don't ask questions\" about a certain number, but sometimes worse.\n\nThere's a pretty thick CPA code of conduct that I was happy to apply by telling this type of client to politely fuck off. Despite what some may think, absolutely no client is worth pleasing in exchange for your designation.\n\nAt the time my firms billing rates were middle of the road. Now I am at a higher end firm and I see the firm telling clients to fuck off for less.\n\nSo I guess that leaves the sketchy low end CPA firms. I can't speak for those internally, but I can say that they are more routinely inspected, and I don't think they would be very good at whatever tax scams they are advising. Thier clients are highly likely to be caught.\n\nTLDR; in contrast to what your accountant wants you to think, your high accounting and tax prep fees are not correlated with your tax savings.\n\nFor every tax saving they find they might catch two missed taxable transactions. A fat code of conduct will cause most, if not all, accountants to refuse to overlook those missed transactions.\n\nAlso it's prohibited for CPAs (in Canada at least) to charge fees based on results.",

I cancelled my regular deposits and just let myself spend my paycheque on food and video games (and tattoos and haircolour now that stuff is open) and things I always wanted but wouldn\u2019t let myself indulge in. \n\nI\u2019m chilling out mentally now so I\u2019ll probably start contributing to my savings again soon.

And the fucked up part is that number is *usually* around 500 Million in assets. Yes, you can always buy a few Picassos and toss them on the fire to keep warm or build a mansion and tear it down constantly, but short of that kind of wasteful spending, you generally are going to make money faster than you can spend it (once you reach the magic number).\n\nBut after a billion in assets the useless things you can buy gets even more amazingly bespoke and meaningless: Swarovski Crystal studded Hummer Model 3 with diamond encrusted vodka bottle chiller in the driver's arm rest for example. Or a 500 Million dollar yacht for Bezos. These guys are so rich that was *pocket change.*",

It's just an absolutely insane amount of money.\n\nBTW, I'm starting to think that a lot of those billions the ultra-rich have... Aren't real, that it's mostly a stock-market **speculation**, one house of cards after another backed by thin air and no tangible assets.  That *perceived* wealth could vanish in a puff of smoke or be seriously paired down if *anything* goes sideways.\n\n(I'll be over-simplifying, there, but please bear with me) Think about it: individual X starts a company, somehow it becomes successful and then goes on the stock market.  Company founder wasn't particularly rich before, suddenly is worth countless billions...  Billions from what? That person didn't see a swelling bank account, didn't see a sudden massive cash influx into the company's coffers, no, those billions are all from the stock market.  And you think that money's real?\n\nI could go on and talk about margin loans used to disguise income (which in itself is seriously f\\*cked up) but I hope you get the idea.  What would happen to people like jeff bezos if the stock market took a serious downturn? I'm sure that many don't have revenue-generating assets that could replace the current source of their \"wealth\".",

They have stock portfolios, IRAs, 401ks, own real estate, own business. These items are only worth what people are willing to buy them at. Stock market crashes then you're screwed. Business goes under, screwed. Property values tank, screwed. Want to sell the business/property? Then it's only worth the selling price. What the wealthy end up doing is they take out loans or lines of credit at the bank. The bank knows they're rich because they own amazon (Bezos) so the risk of defaulting is low. Sometimes they trade it for their company stock. \n\nOverall, people get taxed on yearly income or capital gains. If you dont claim an income... no tax. Your business took a loss? No corporate tax this year. Capital gains tax kicks in once you pull out of your portfolio. \n\nCant tax you for spending your loan money (yet).",

It's very well documented that the mega rich use a whole host of both legal and illegal methods to avoid paying taxes - offshore accounts, undeclared income, other accounting tricks. Forget the worst offending billionaires, even our favourite sports stars (Ronaldo, Messi) have been caught evading tax recently.\n\nThe question is asking why such rich individuals would actively go to the effort of not paying their fair share of taxes, not why they aren't taxed on their entire assets every year.\n\nI also have a personal view that it's not particularly productive that we're so quick to jump to this \"it's not real money\" narrative whenever discussing the obscene wealth of billionaires (not aiming this at your particular comment at all, which was well written and informative). You mention Bezos - he took 10 BILLION dollars out of Amazon last year, in cold hard cash, and he'll do a similar amount this year. Of course most of his absolutely absurd amount of wealth is in his companies, property etc, but the idea that this wealth is completely inaccessible to him or that he doesn't also have a similarly absurd amount of liquid wealth is letting him &amp; society off the hook from the magnitude of the inequality he represents.",

Do you look for various rebates etc when buying a new phone?\n\nAnd this behavior isn't specific to the rich. HR block, turbo tax etc heavily, almost exclusively base their ads on maximizing deductions and tax credits, and those ads are targeting the average citizen, not the rich. \n\nSorry to answer your question with a question, but: Why would anyone willingly pay more than they need to?\n\nRegardless of how people feel about the rich, they generally dont get rich by simply wasting/unecessarily spending money. Some studies place 88% of millionaires as \"self made\" meaning they didn't start rich, and more likely than not had to put considerable effort into minimizing costs/expenses. That is not a skillset that just evaporates at an arbitrarily determined level of wealth. \n\nAre there problems with our tax system and how the different deductions and incentives work?

I think this thread is missing a major motivation that both the rich and not rich have for hiring tax advisors: not screwing up and getting in trouble. I advise big banks and funds on taxes. Yes minimizing tax is a goal, but for the most part, these companies want to avoid doing anything super risky tax wise, especially if a rating agency is involved in the deal. The main reason they hire people like me is that complex transactions involve complex tax rules and it's very easy to screw something up and put yourself in a world of hurt. Wanna set up a mortgage securitization? There is a specific vehicle that lets you do it, but there are very specific rules on how to do it, otherwise you get slapped with a huge extra tax, your deal is ruined, and every investor and their mom is suing you. When I help set something up like that, I'm not saving my clients money, I'm saving them from paying extra tax and getting sued into the stone age for securities fraud. Doing taxes wrong has implications way beyond getting audited and having to pay up.\n\nLikewise, for regular people, a lot of them have a fear that taxes are too complicated for them to do themselves, so they turn to HR Block or whoever for comfort that they did it right. That's why they often offer \"audit protection\". This fear is probably unfounded for most people, but it is there.",

There are myriad other things like this. In fact, the accounting fees are tax write-offs.\n\nThe average person looks at this as if the billionaires are getting wages. They're typically not. Elon Musk for instance lives off of loans. All of his money is not money, it's \"wealth\" - ownership of stocks and other assets.  \n\n\nEdit: One thing to add: the wages paid to the pilot and stewardess are write-offs as well.

I suspect that at that level of wealth the process is almost automatic from the billionaire's perspective. \n\nAs to why bother, I doubt there's a level of wealth at which you suddenly think, 'That's enough.' Your wealth generates more wealth, and a lot of people other than you have a stake in perpetuating it. Having it is better than not having it, and it costs you barely anything to gain more. Even if you do decide to give it to people with greater need, like Bill Gates, you'd probably prefer to give it away to the people you choose in the style you choose. I'm sure Bezos has just as many objections to how the government spends his tax money as the average American does.",

            "comment": "There's also a facet to this that people don't tend to consider for whatever reason, which is simply, why wouldn't they try to avoid taxes?  We are upset that billionaires don't pay enough in taxes, which is fair, but it's up to the government to tax them appropriately, not up to the billionaires to be like \"Well, my taxes were only $140k this year, but I tacked on a couple million more, get yourself something pretty.\"  Let me tell you, when it's time to do taxes, I'm looking for every legal deduction I can take, the same as they would do.  \nPlease don't take this as me stating billionaires shouldn't pay more, it's rather the opposite.  It's up to the government to raise the taxes on the millionaires and billionaires to make them pay what they legally owe.  The problem is the implication with a question like this is that they don't pay what they legally owe, and that's generally not the case.  They will, and do, exploit every possible loophole to avoid being taxed, as would I, and most likely anyone here would, too, who's smart.  The trick is to close those legal and quasi-legal loopholes.  \nIn the 50's, the upper tax bracket on earnings over $5M in a year was 90%.  If you're not familiar with tax brackets that means ONLY the amount you make OVER $5M is taxed at 90%.  The secret of this trick wasn't the government trying to take 90% of their money, the the trick was that reinvesting in your business, paying your employees better wages, paying for pensions, investing in the arts and sciences, all of those things are tax deductible.  So as a millionaire, if I make $6M, I can either give $900,000 of that last million to the US government, or I can set up the 'Regional Memorial Hospital Richter12x2 Cancer Ward'.  That makes me look good, saves me money, and helps the community for a long time to come.  Which was what was intended.  Reinvest the wealth in the community versus hoarding it.  As a millionaire, would you rather have another increment in the bank account, or a literal building with your name on it you can drive by each day as a reminder of what a hot shot and all around good guy you are?  \nEventually though, the people who write the laws and tax brackets were replaced by people who really didn't understand the strategy of the system, and the tax rates were lowered.  Then at some point, millionaires and billionaires figured out how buying politicians could also possibly be a tax deduction if it was done by their corporation, which is also a person on its own for the purposes of wrong-doing, and now we are where we are, electing politicians who we thought represented our interests, but who end up voting for whatever their corporate sponsors tell them, and pushing through whatever bills are written for them.",

It's not that they actively try hard to avoid them - the thing is, the government encourages people to own businesses and to invest, so they throw in  tax incentives to do so (e.g. business expenses are tax deductible, selling stocks after 1 year will get you less tax fees, etc.). \n\nThese sorts of rules (in theory) create jobs, value, and innovation while a business owner or investor will choose to abide by them in exchange to get their kid's tuition, their mom's hospital bills, or if all is going well, a new car. They probably could do it either way like you say, but if we were in their shoes and know all the tax \"cheat codes\", we'd probably be doing the same thing.",

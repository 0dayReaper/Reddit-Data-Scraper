            "comment": "It's because of the stuff that's popular. Find ones that have a... for lack of a better word, healthier, more \"loving\" atmosphere, and you'll be more likely to find ones where the actresses are enjoying themselves, with a smile on their face. Hardcore stuff is meant to appeal to dudes that want things their way, even if it means being domineering and neglectful of their partners. Ones advertised as being \"for women\" are more likely to fulfill that whole \"healthy atmosphere\" thing. Even if you're not into the lovey-dovey stuff, the ones in which the girl is in control will often feature women who look more comfortable. Predictably, this type will feature the guys on the back foot, so to speak.\n\nIf you're looking for something specific, try the following to get you started:\n\n* FSDSS-611\n* MIAE-346\n* MIDV-093\n\n\nHint: The long-ass Japanese titles are a good indicator of what you'll get if you can read it. The first one, for example, contains phrases like \"staring at each other\" and \"loving one another\". The second one contains the phrase \"sorrowful first love\". The last one... \"&gt;!reverse rape!&lt;. So yeah.",

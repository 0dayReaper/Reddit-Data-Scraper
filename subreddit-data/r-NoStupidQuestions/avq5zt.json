Related memory, we lived on the outside of the neighborhood with woods behind our house. At night we'd open the back sliding door and yell \"Bear, Bear\" in a high pitched sing song voice. Sometimes no response, wait an hour, try again, eventually he'd meow back. We'd go back and forth \"Bear!\" *faint meow* \"Bear!\" *slightly louder meow* until he made his way home for the night. It's great to think about him again. \n\n\nSad news alert: My big brother died on Monday night from a heroin overdose. He was the oldest of 5 and now I need to fill his shoes. He loved reddit, introduced me to it years ago. It sucks so much, if you know anyone struggling reach out. Thinking about Bear cat brought back a whole new category of Sam memories. It's nice and sad. Thanks reddit\n\nEdit: it's super sad seeing funny stuff on here and thinking ohh I'll save to show Sam and I can't anymore. Gosh this sucks.  I apologize for weighing down this light hearted post. It's therapeutic to talk about it instead of just keeping it inside.",

He comes over for dinner every day.\"\n\nTHEFUCKAREYOUTALKINGABOUT! He does WHAT!? I feed that cat two meals a day AND he hunts and eats field critters all night. And you're telling me he's been coming to your house for two years for EXTRAS? And his name is Chips. He sleeps in my bed. Actually, on my face.\n\nBut seeing each other outside was never a problem. He LOVED outside time with us. It took me too long to realize it and we only got a couple years of outside playtime with him. He would walk to the neighborhood mailboxes with us. He would roll in the grass in the front yard with us. He would climb the trees and stalk us.\n\nIt started one day when he meowed at the front door and I let him out. Then he immediately meowed to come back in. When he immediately wanted back out I was frustrated, but as soon as he stepped out he turned around and meowed back at me. So I stepped outside and shut the door, \"NOW WHAT.\" He walked a few steps, looked back and meowed. I so walked to him and he kept walking. We explored the front yard and had a great time.\n\nIf you are letting your cat outside you should go with them. Play in the yard. Follow them around the neighborhood. Let them show you *their* world.",

She would walk two meters in front of us and show the way, and sometimes stop in a patch of grass to get scratches. One time we walked a bit further than we usually do, in a different direction than the one the cat was waking towards, and she began meowing loudly at us. My boyfriend and I joked that we were going out of her territory and she was warning us.",

They recognize that we aren\u2019t great a deciphering their body language, and they recognize that we communicate using sound, so they meow at us. Normally adult cats don\u2019t meow (edit: at other cats, at least).\n\nIf you make eye contact with a cat and you want to let it know you aren\u2019t a threat you can try \u201ckiss blinking\u201d which is basically a slow blink. Sometime the break in eye contact can reassure them that you\u2019re not actually hunting them.\n\n[heres a cat doing a blinking kiss](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K4C1FX9Y124)\n(Warning, video is kind of loud)",

Maybe the cat recognizes that it gets help when it meows, but it could just be it\u2019s personality.\n\nMy cat absolutely loves me, she\u2019ll follow me around the house, she waits outside my bedroom door when I wake up, she tries to lay on me if I\u2019m in the bath (or just chill in the bathroom in general), and I\u2019m the only person she cares to cuddle with. If I give her a kiss on the head she seems indifferent and confused, and I read that cats can range anywhere from loving kisses to hating them. \n\nThey\u2019re weird little creatures that can have such big and different personalities.",

You can see this all the time with dogs, because dogs express their emotion pretty loudly.  If a dog sees you through the window, and can't hear or smell you, they have a confused look like they aren't sure whether to bark or greet you. \n\nDogs and cats both recognize smell more than anything, then voice and pattern of movement, appearance least of all.  Your cat probably was confused.\n\n\n\n",

He climbed out of a tree and just strolled  right up to my stepdad and sat down. SD thought it was cute so he gave him a fry and said \u201cWho\u2019s got a name for this guy?\u201d and one of the neighbor kids said \u201cFuzzyballs\u201d and it stuck. \n\nFast forward a few years and this guy is a celebrity. It was so strange because it was like he was tame. I never saw him eating anything but human food. It probably wasn\u2019t too healthy but it was cute. During the winter whoever found him in their garage had to take care of him all winter. We got him one year and it was insane how well adjusted he was. He must\u2019ve been someones pet or something before he came to us. \n\nOne night we were all out catching fireflies and one of the kids noticed him and pointed him out but then one of the girls screamed bloody murder as a COYOTE JUMPED OUT OF A BUSH AND TACKLED HIM. You can imagine this would be a traumatic experience for everyone involved but some of us were men of action. \n\nGrowing up in the Midwest, you\u2019re taught not to mess with coyotes. They\u2019re smaller than wolves and frankly, they\u2019re pussies, but they\u2019re still wild animals and predators but we didn\u2019t care. We led a fucking charge on this coyote carrying our friend away, shooting nerf guns and yelling expletives. I shit you not, I\u2019ve never felt a part of something as important as this rescue mission. \n\nHe tries running away with his prey but gives up after a few yards as we\u2019re getting close and Fuzzyballs (the tough bastard) is wriggling around and throwing him off balance so the coyote drops him. \n\nFuzzyballs is obviously shaken up and just as terrified of this tsunami of kids as the coyote was so he bolted but after a few days he started coming around again. \n\nA few years later he disappeared and I can only imagine the coyote came back to finish the job. \n\nFuzzyballs if you\u2019re out there, don\u2019t be a stranger.

When I see him hunting, expertly hiding behind bushes, sneaking around the high grass, I always call him loudly, as if he's the sweetest little thing. I get really angry looks from him for blowing his cover.",

Folks laugh when they see us out strolling but it's cos she'll just panic and run straight into danger.\n\nI tried to adopt a cat but the Cats Protection League in Scotland won't let you adopt a cat unless you have an enclosed garden as if cats can't climb fucking fences and still be minced by cars. Lots of people hate cats round here and abuse them so I'd never think to let my cat out alone :(",

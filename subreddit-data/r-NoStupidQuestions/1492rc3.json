The state issues a bond that where they promise to give the owner a certain amount of money at a certain time, and then they sell it for somewhat less than that amount. So far all bond payments have been paid out. This is in large part financed by issuing new bonds.",

The recent ones to do so were Argentina and Greece.   However,  treasure bonds have duration in the 1-10 years range, It's seems pretty unlikely that US will bankrupt in the next 10 years. Considering the uncertainties on the economic situation public debts for countries like US or Germany is like one of the safest investment you can do.",

            "comment": "The US is constantly paying back their debt. US treasury bonds have fixed maturation dates, so China or Japan can buy a 5 year bond and know that they'll be paid back, plus interest, in 5 years. Of course, the government is selling *new* bonds to pay for this, but since they've never defaulted on the bonds, they're still a safe investment. \n\n... Also, foreign countries only buy a small fraction of the debt. The majority of it is bought by Americans, American companies, and the US government itself.",

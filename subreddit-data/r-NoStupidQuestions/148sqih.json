    "postText": "I'm watching lost in space. This guy is practicing some stress test for a flight in his spaceship. The test requires him to recover from passing out. I understand it's just a silly sci-fi but...could you pass out and recover 10 times in an hour and be ok? Theoretically how many times can you pass out in a row and still be functional? Everything I've googled leads me to stories of people passing out 5 times with months in between or years.",

High G forces or oxygen deprivation would cause this phenomena. Being unconscious due to lack of oxygen to the brain will start to do damage to your brain cells after about 1 minute of oxygen being exhausted from your blood stream. \n\nThere are breathing techniques and muscle tensing techniques that real life pilots use in high G simulators to remain conscious for longer.",

Fire to nuclear reactors? Chewing leaves to pills that can cure deadly infections? Rhyming stories around the campfire to the Lord of the Rings?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that us humans learn from each other. A generation takes the previous' knowledge and pushes it a bit farther. A painter grows up practicing techniques from the masters before developing their own. Also, sometimes other inventions are necessary. Couldn't develop penicillin without a microscope. \n\nI'm not a moral philosophy expert so hopefully someone else can add to this, but here's a rough timeline- \n\nc. 300 000 years ago- our species emerges. We are similar to chimpanzees. We form tribes. We brutally torture and kill anyone \"different or other\". This allows us to survive and pass down our genes. Why should we act differently?\n\n1750 BCE- King Hammurabi writes some laws. One is \"an eye for an eye\". Meaning, if someone kills your daughter, you can kill their daughter *and no one else*. This was revolutionary. Prior to this, if you determined your neighbor has become \"other\" by wronging you in some way, you were free to exercise your anger however you saw fit.\n\nc. 1500 BCE Jewish Torah/ Old Testement 10 Commandments written. Not getting into religious debate, but from a secular standpoint, Exodus provides a fascinating look into morality in the Middle East at the time. God tells how you should treat your neighbor- no killing, stealing (including the \"property\" of his wife.) Then proceeds to tell people to kill the \"different\" tribe next door, rape their daughters, and enslave the leftovers. \n\nc. 1500 BCE- In India, Hinduism begins and develops the concept of Karma- do good things and you'll be rewarded. \n\nc. 500 BCE- The Buddah of India and Confucius of China teach a version of \"treat others how you want to be treated. \n\nc. 470 BCE- Socrates/Plato of Greece. Talks about being \"good and virtuous\". Plato claims that the highest good is following whatever the majority of the city vote into law. (Interestingly, it is obviously morally good for a slave to obey their masters. And the poor, women, and non-Greeks are \"other\". ) \n\n1650 CE- Hobbes says it's moral to establish peace and that we can *only* do this by listening to a King. \n\n1775 CE- Thomas Payne writes Common Sense encouraging the now USA to separate from Britain. This led to the US and French revolutions, and the idea of the American Dream- a poor person can grow up to be a powerfull leader. \n\n1780 CE- Immanuel Kant develops the idea that ethics are universal. What is right should be applicable to everyone in every situation (ie do not kill) and we should follow those rules out of duty, not a sense of reward (happiness or heaven). \n\nAt this time, the Industrial Revolution made it much easier for a society to function without slaves. Unsurprisingly this is when we start seeing mainstream objection to slavery. \n\nWe invent radio, photographs, television. Ships, trains, and planes. We can suddenly see the \"other\" people are a lot like us and learn to consider all humans as part of our group. \n\nThe Holocaust happens- massive torture and murder which was *extensively documented* in response \n1948 CE- The Concept of Universal Human Rights is created by the UN. This is really the first time mainstream society starts considering torture/murder of opposing armies to be a bad thing.",

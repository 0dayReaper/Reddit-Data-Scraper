After arguing for a while, they were willing to let him use a restroom in the office, with administrators around him. My son is a good kid, has a 4.0, and is in 2 honor classes. I need to know if this is legal, and what I can do about this?",

I was in high school in the late 90s, and my high school locked every bathroom except the one next to administration because kids wouldn't stop smoking in them.",

She always let us go to the bathroom whenever after that.",

The kid kept complaining of a stomachache, asking for their mom, she told them to stop and was extremely hard on the kid for not keeping up on the day's activities. The kid was very obviously unwell to my kindergarten eyes, pale as a ghost and just looking really off. We had to go to gym class and this nasty mean teacher called the kid out for lagging behind our group, she stopped the line and demanded the kid walk next to her in front. The second the kid got there, she turned on her heel and is leading us away and the kid goes, \"ohh no\" and nails her on the skirt, pantyhose and shoes. She yelled, \"[kid's name], the bathroom was right there!\" Because a rude ass teacher like her would have let the kid slide into the bathroom when she was on the kid all day for not doing exactly what they were told? Right. Sure thing.",

One time I was at the teachers desk in front of the entire class, trying to ask if I could go use the restroom, and even though she said yes I just couldn't hold it and started to pee myself, right there in front of everyone. This blessed angel of a teacher, without any hesitation, pushed her favorite coffee mug off of her desk and splashed the water all over my pants and the floor, covering the fact that I had just left a puddle of piss. If it wasn't for this lady, my life at this school would have been so much different, and even now 13 years later I still think about her and wish I could tell her thank you.",

During the recesses, the restrooms are open with about 143 yard duty aides, the principal, and the vice principal watching guard.\n\nThe kid who got caught... I've had to walk him around during the recesses making sure he picks up trash and rakes bark.\n\nTotal waste of manpower, but what're you gonna do?? As soon as the bathrooms were locked we had to put locks on the water spickets, because those suddenly became the target of destruction.\n\nSmh.",

Nobody is doing this without videoing it and uploading it.  If you can find it, bring it to the police and file a police report (yes I know how much school administrators love doing that).  Because the police have the power to subpoena IP address records from Tiktok (who will gladly give it up for free) and can then go to the ISP and get the home address of the person that uploaded the video.",

So they would have to keep it in their main profile. \nWhy can\u2019t schools just look back on the OP\u2019s videos and bam, there\u2019s your culprit. \n\nWhat am I missing here???",

This was really bad for me because I had very heavy periods. One day I bled through my pants because I couldn't find a janitor to unlock the restroom. My dad complained to the school board that it should be illegal to close restrooms, and they told him it was within the principal's right to do so. But a nice teacher did give me special access to their restroom after that.",

            "comment": "My school is starting to do this, but they haven't completely shut down the restrooms. They made it so that only one gender bathroom is open at each location (We have like 6 different bathrooms of varying quality around the school). My school is structured so that the math and science classrooms are one one side of campus and the english and history classrooms are one the other side with everything else in between. If you're a girl on the english and history side of campus, you might have to walk all the way to the math and science side of campus to use the restroom and vice versa. It also changes every day. I'm guessing this is so they can more easily monitor the restrooms without having to make everyone find a security person or janitor to open the restroom for them, but really all it does is make us walk more.\n\nI hate this stupid trend of kids going around and fucking up all of the school facilities. \n3 classrooms were close for cleaning for 3 days after kids broke in and sprayed everything with a fire extinguisher (one of those was a computer lab/the robotics club which I'm a part of and I would have been so pissed if they had broken our robot). \nOne teacher got all of her stuff stolen from her classroom (not just personal belongings but most of the stuff in her classroom) and she was completely destroyed since she was already having an extremely hard week.\nthe hand sanitizer dispensers in the classrooms are getting stolen and so are the water bottle refilling stations. \nThere's probably more that I haven't even heard about yet. At this rate students won't even be allowed on campus after school outside extracurriculars like we're some kind of elementary school. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I'm a high schooler.\n\nSorry, I needed to get this rant out there because I'm so tired of this\n\nedit: grammar.",

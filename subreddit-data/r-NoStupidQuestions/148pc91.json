Few questions to start:\n\nWhat's the purpose of the question? Do you want to start and develop a business or are you just interested in learning more about the subject?\n\nWhat kind of business are you asking about? It depends on the industry but VERY basically you would have a product/service that costs you something (cost), and then the amount of money you bring in by selling that thing (revenue). Revenue - cost = profit, the amount of money you have LEFT OVER after replenishing your product.",

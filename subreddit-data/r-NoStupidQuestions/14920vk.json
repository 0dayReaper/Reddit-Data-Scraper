You'd still enjoy the remake without having played the original, but it wouldn't give you the full experience.\n\nIf you want to be even more detailed, you should go :\n\n* *Final Fantasy VII*\n* *Advent Children* (film)\n* *Dirge of Cerberus*\n* *Crisis Core* or the remake *Crisis Core Reunion*\n* *Final Fantasy VII Remake* with *Intergrade*",

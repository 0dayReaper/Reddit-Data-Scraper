The first cultivation is thought to have happened in the Mediterranean region, where the natural habitats were salty and wet, or marshy soils near the coast where celery grew in agropyro-rumicion-plant communities.[4]\n\n&gt;North of the alps wild celery is found only in the foothill zone on soils with some salt content. It prefers moist or wet, nutrient rich, muddy soils. It cannot be found in Austria and is increasingly rare in Germany.[5]",

The cabbage variety of bitterness can be particularly off-putting to children, who tend to be very sensitive to bitter tastes, noticeably more so than adults. \n\nI like all those vegetables but (except for broccoli) only if they are roasted, which brings out some residual sweetness and usually bathes it in enough oil that it is rich and yummy. This method does particularly well with Brussel sprouts, I find, turning them from inedible balls of bitterness into something soft and buttery with a nice umami taste.",

                            "comment": "You would be surprised at how many fruits &amp; vegetables, even nuts, are completely \"engineered\" by humans.  We just did it the hard, slow way over centuries of careful, selective cross-pollinating and cultivating.  Like dogs, but faster since plants are pretty much generational over a single year, with a few exceptions.\n\nTechnically, anything in the wild that's an edible, dark, leafy green in the Kale family is \"wild broccoli\", because Broccoli (as well as the 'cruciferous' veggies cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collard greens, several other sorts of \"greens\", etc.) are all Cabbage.  In fact, even common, green cabbage is man-made.  Their common ancestor was a lot like Kale, but even more foul- and bitter-tasting.  All those other veggies come from the attempt to grow something from it that tasted better and was more filling.  Well, many attempts over thousands of years, maybe hundreds of thousands.  Originally, it was the only plant in Northern Europe and Russia that provided vitamin C enough to stave off scurvy, in the absence of citrus fruits.  It's the reason Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons were able to colonize Scandinavia and other northern climes at all.\n\nMost melons are berries, taxonomically speaking.  So are apples and pears.  In their natural, original form, they're berry-sized like you'd expect, up to and including watermelon.  The rest is our doing.  Wild strawberries are one of the few kind-of exceptions.  In the wild, they're way tinier, very berry-sized (even though they aren't a berry, technically), but they're also much sweeter and more flavorful.  Typically the original, wild form of our produce is more bland or bitter tasting, less sweet, but strawberries are the reverse.\n\nCarrots used to be white or purple.  The Dutch engineered the orange variety in honor of William of Orange.  Dunno why they took over though.  I think they tend to grow bigger and fatter than the wild varieties.  They also taste milder.  Wild carrots are a little peppery-spicy IIRC.\n\nEven Maize, good 'ol sweet corn, originally had ears about the size of the head of a stalk of wheat, and (multicolored) kernels about the size of a wheat kernel.  Which only makes sense, since they're both cereal-grasses.  Corn just apparently has the genes for Gigantism, which we exploited for food.\n\nAvocados are the exception, or one exception I know of.  They're pretty much natural.  They depend on animal dispersal; their seeds are supposed to be eaten by ground sloths or other giant megafauna that are long since extinct.  If it weren't for human cultivation, they'd die out eventually.  But their original form is pretty close to what we grow, just with bigger seeds and less flesh around them, and a bit rounder.\n\nEDIT:  I forgot to add that, as far as wild berries are concerned, park rangers and boy/girl scouts will tell you there's a simple rule for edibility.  If the berries are bluish, they're always safe.  If they're white or yellow, they're always toxic.  And if they're red... you're rolling the dice.  Some red berries are safe, and some aren't, and you shouldn't take the chance unless you really know what you're looking at (much like wild mushrooms).",

It is the name of a small principality in France that belonged to his family holdings. The word for the colour orange actually came into use shortly before his birth. There is very little evidence that orange carrots where created to honour William of Orange during the Eighty Years war. As far as I am aware this was a random mutation. \n\nFunny thing is that orange was used in the flags of the early Republic, and is still used as the national colour. The two got conflated quite fast!",

Genetically modified is used to describe things like gene splicing and genome editing. \n\nThat being said, most all foods are GMOs, even foods with non GMO labels, because there is incredibly lax regulation on the term. Furthermore, GMOs are completely safe and literally the best thing we've ever created in terms of food production. GMOs are superior in basically every way to their non GMO counterparts. \n\nAnother rant because why not: processed foods like McDonalds don't spoil and people are for some reason turned off by that. It's a fucking miracle of science. If you went back 300 years and told people that you had invented a hamburger that was 500 calories, nutritionally complete, tasted pretty decent, and was shelf stable for upwards of 2 years, you would be a fucking god of food to them.",

But say a farmer wanted the heads to be smaller and the leaves to be bigger, they would choose seed from plants with the biggest leaves. Eventually big leaf will look different to big flower, even though they used to be the same. At that point you have a new cultivar\n\nTechnically a plant we've bred into existence can take up residence in a wild eco system, but it's so unlikely to work it may as well be dismissed. The reason is that plants do many things to protect themselves and ensure the next generation of seed is dropped. This could mean producing nasty tasting chemicals (or yummy ones admittedly), growing really fast when conditions are unfavorable (bolting) which results in a stringy and bland plant or slowing down growth during times of low energy. Many of the survival mechanisms employed by wild plants make them unappealing to us, usually by tasting like shit so animals are less likely to eat them. We also want to persuade the plant to delay dropping seed for as long as possible, to get growth in other areas. These factors mean a domesticated plant has very little chance at competing against plants that still have all of their survival mechanisms in tact",

After thousands of years of cultivation, a lot of food plants have exaggerated features that serve hungry humans more than the plants themselves.  Without humans protecting the broccoli plant from pests, providing extra water and nutrients, and removing other plants (weeds) that compete for sunlight, the broccoli would be at a disadvantage to its leaner, meaner wild plant cousins.  It depends entirely on humans intentionally gathering seeds and re-sowing the plants - and this is a kind of symbiosis in action, because we need them and they need us.",

Do the same next year.\n\n&gt;Could a broccoli plant be planted and take up in the wild?\n\nMost crop plants are not particularly prolific compared to wild plants. They are designed to spend most of their energy creating the biggest and most numerous food parts/usable parts for us, and that leaves little energy to propagate themselves assuming they are even capable of growing without careful cultivation at all. Most of them aren't, they will quickly be outcompeted for resources by weeds and other native plant life and eventually they will wither away and die on their own.\n\nNature is pretty metal, and our delicate, coddled crop plants stand little chance of surviving in the wild against other plants that millions of years of evolution have hardened for battle.",

Cattle were developed from an extinct wild animal called aurochs. Apples were domesticated from wild apples which are barely considered edible; small, bitter, and full of seeds, like crab apples. Oranges are hybrids of domesticated versions of wild citrus which are not very sweet at all. Wild pigs are still around but do not look quite like the ones we use to make bacon and sausage, nor are they nearly as docile. And so on; some of the wild stock we have domesticated can still be found and even recognized and eaten in wild form, although they will have a slightly different flavor and will produce less edible meat, fruit, or whatever. Others are no longer living in the wild, or would be unrecognizable to most people today from their domestic counterparts.",

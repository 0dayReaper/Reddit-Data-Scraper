A toilet stool will help your stool like you wouldn't believe. Absolute game changer. Pooping is faster, easier to clean and more complete compared with not using one.\n\n\nIf you look for toilet stalls on Amazon you'll see loads. Squatty potty brand is a rip. Tip: go for a taller on rather than a shorter one. Knees propped up more = better pooping.\n\n\nGood luck.",

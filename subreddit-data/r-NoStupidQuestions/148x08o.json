You want to eat enough to get full, but be mindful of what you\u2019re getting full of, a plate full of veggies, fruits, lean protein is very different than a plate full of greasy fast food \n\nNot eating to the point of starving yourself causes your body to think there isn\u2019t enough food and it will try to hold onto fat, or cause you to binge eat to get nutrients that youre lacking \n\nThis is a good video that explains it: https://youtu.be/P7yM0TKvUm4",

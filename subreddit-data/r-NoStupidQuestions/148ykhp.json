Physically it wont hurt you much but mentally it can get quite heavy when using high doses regularly.\n\nI also smoke crack often nowadays and I'd call crack even less a hard drugs. It's more addictive and will kill you faster but the actual high is short and not truly worth its money. (A lot more uncomfortable already starting when you wake up with smoking crack in your head. Constant toilet number 2 and a sort of anxiety and thats before you even start smoking).\n\nI recommend trying acid just once when interested (not very addictive since using it daily wont work), I'll never recommend crack to anyone.",

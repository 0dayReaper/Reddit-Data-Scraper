I have no private health insurance\n\nSeparately I had a bad primary outbreak of GHSV last year when I had to spend a week in a different hospital (free of course). I just walked into the ER and got in right away. I had a private room. Now I still get regular free consultations with a gynaecologist at the hospital. Free scripts posted to me etc\n\nAmericans in my support group are in bad marriages because they can\u2019t lose their partner\u2019s insurance, plus or paying large deductibles etc\n\nI was in the US recently on holiday and had to pay US$460 for a podiatrist to spend 5 minutes cutting down my ingrown toenail.

My state (FL) also used our income to decide what medical coverage she'll get even though she would always be disabled. If she was 18, she'd qualify for full coverage from the state. She died when she was 11. We owe the IRS thousands of dollars for keeping her on Medicaid so that we could have full-time nursing for her. If we had gone one state over to GA, she would have been covered, and we wouldn't owe anything. Our system is beyond broken.",

If you are middle class person it's pretty much:\n\n- hospital/emergencies - public healthcare\n- specialist visits - private insurance (shorter waiting lines) with a switch to public if you really need expensive treatment or hospital.\n- dental - mostly private due waiting lines but it's really location dependent.\n\nRicher people sometimes use private hospitals or use private treatment e.g. for small surgeries. \n\nMeds are usually offered through co-pay (depending on bracket offered by government). \n\nStill the major benefit of public healthcare is that you don't go bankrupt e.g. if ER is needed. I collapsed in public transport, peopled called ER, I received treatment and paid 0. I broke my ankle playing soccer, co-workers drive me to ER, I've waited 3hrs though (as life threatening injuries, heart attacks etc have priority) but still paid 0. And it's not like any private place was open around 22.\n\nIt's insane comfort. You are annoyed by waiting time, worry about your health or the fact you need to notify your employer (who can't fire you, if you provide doctor's paper you went to ER) etc. And you don't worry about the fact you'll lose all your savings because you messed up your leg.",

We have those same wait times here now.  Need to see a specialist?  My kids have been on 6+ month waitlists to see pediatric specialists.  The only difference is the price we pay afterwards.  I think everyone complaining about wait times has never had to do anything other than go into an urgent care office, where the wait times are usually short.  If you have to use the US medical system beyond that, we already have the wait times they claim as the primary problem in other countries.",

In public system I would wait c. 6 months to first visit and probably 3-4 more to finish all stuff.\n\nIn private I paid about 500 USD for 3 visits at endocrinologist, USG, biopsy, oncologist consultation and it took about 2 months as most of it was outside private insurance I bought (costs 700 USD per year, but a lot of stuff is not covered...like in private insurance). There's significant difference in waiting time, especially if your sickness/injury is not that life threatening/urgent. Especially for specialists as system is underfunded. \n\nEven in urgent care people who complain about waiting time are like me. I had broken ankle. Hurts AF, but it's obvious they need to prioritize and any person with heart attack or stroke symptoms (or any other requiring ASAP care) will be put first. Usually it's nothing but if doctor misses them they might die. I will just scroll my phone and curse waiting time. It's not possible to take everyone in 1-2 hrs.\n\nBTW once our system become more and more hybrid...the waiting times in private healthcare significantly increased. Decade ago when private medical companies started going to \"private\" practicioner usually meant same week appointment. Now it's usually booked. Maybe not for 6 months (that's for public system which covers everyone, including elderly and low income people, so essentially a lot of people) but it's not unusual to wait 1-2 months for visit or certain tests.\n\nActually hybrid options works pretty nice IMO. The average quality of service as well as expensive and bankruptcy giving stuff is offered to everyone. If you have money you can just pay a premium for more premium service. It's not equal for everyone, but it's still better than leaving more than half of population at bankruptcy lottery risk.",

They don't pay a dime until we've paid at least $5,000 in expenses for an individual, or $10,000 as a family.  Once one of those minimums has been met, they then pay 70% of (covered) expenses until we've paid $15,000 I think it is.  There is a maximum they'll pay before 100% of it becomes my responsibility again, but I don't recall what that is.\n\nYour wait times sound very similar to ours.  I was told 1 year from one doctor to establish a \"new patient\" relationship (and this is a doc I was already seeing, but due to COVID got pushed long enough that I wasn't considered a patient anymore.). Another doc told me 6 months, but was able to get me in sooner under a cancelled appointment since I had an urgent need to be seen as a follow-up from an ER visit.  My kids have been on year-plus waitlists to see specialists, but 6 month is pretty usual.\n\nUltimately our systems are nearly identical, ours just costs exponentially more.",

I remember talking to people without insurance who was describing what was almost certainly symptoms of gallstones or another who many of us agreed that was very likely diabetes. Those posters didn't have insurance or had insurance where they'd still have to pay some and they would only \"keep it in mind\" or \"consider\" going to the doctor about it because they couldn't afford it at the moment. They promised if it got \"bad enough\" they'd go to the doctor. \n\nIn countries like Canada where you don't pay at the time you see the doctor, money very seldom comes into play when deciding to go to the doctor's office (I say seldom, because those who work shift work may need to take unpaid time off to go). Here, we can go if we have any concerns so I can only imagine how delayed detection and treatment is if people kept waiting until they felt it was worth the money to have that lump assessed or their blood sugar levels tested.\n\nHeck - I developed pre-eclampsia while pregnant with my first kid and was on hospital bed rest until inducing delivery. Those outcomes may have been drastically different if I wasn't receiving such regular care (it's the same weekly care recommended in the US at that stage of pregnancy, but not everyone without universal health care can afford to follow those recommendations especially if saving up for the labor bill). If it weren't detected as early as it was or if I resisted going to the hospital because of the cost, the outcomes could have been very different. Not only for that pregnancy, but also the next where I met with the doctor to talk before even trying to conceive to understand the risks. I was monitored more closely during the second pregnancy as a precaution and had no issues",

We very much pay, a lot of money, to have \u201cfree\u201d health care. \n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect system, but it\u2019s pretty good. People generally don\u2019t get left behind, and anything serious is actioned quickly. It\u2019s tough to see the more service-oriented model in the US - because we then sometimes wonder \u201cwhy can\u2019t we have it like that?\u201d\n\nBut it appears the cost of that service flexibility (which relies on spare capacity for last minute availability) is the profit motive - and therefore some people left behind. \n\nI have two big peeves, one on the user side and one on the government side.\n- User: because people don\u2019t get a bill/statement, I believe the system gets overused. Especially things like ER visits. I don\u2019t say abuse in all cases, because abuse implies a degree of malice. It\u2019s more ignorance. People go to the ER with a cold because they have no idea that visit costs the system 2-5k. \n- Policy: the whole operation is publicly funded. So high ticket items like wages become targets for hawkish governments. Right now, it\u2019s nurses. Our compensations for these roles *were* reasonable until Covid; now with inflation they\u2019re not. They\u2019re still great jobs, but the government vilifying people who just want to make a working wage is not a productive solution. And it\u2019s all the workers in the sector - doctors, nurses, PSWs, techs, admins, etc. Nobody is crying for doctors because they make significant amounts of money, but it\u2019s a lurking problem from a global competition standpoint.",

In the public health system it becomes harder to get emergency surgery performed because of the amount of people waiting, and the tiering of emergencies which is highly understandable. When I had to have my gallbladder removed through emergency surgery before its rapturing, I had to wait in hospital for over 5 days without food, fasting in the \u201cpromise of a surgery\u201d. In those 5 days I had my surgery scheduled and cancelled 4 times because people kept presenting with worse emergencies that needed immediate care. It was emotionally draining and I was in a lot of agony. Private health insurance would have ridded me of this but then again I\u2019d have to pay for it, as well as out of pocket fees. I hope this gives you some perspective.\n\nIn addition though I did have $70,000 worth of cancer treatment completely for free because of the type and the stage. So the government here does help those in dire need.",

We had the same thing happen here in the US.  My wife had a gallbladder attack during COVID and went to the ER.  They checked her and sent her home, told her to come back they next day if it gets any worse.  They flat out said if they had any beds free they would have been keeping her for observation and likely a consult with the surgeon first thing the next morning.  Instead she got worse, so we took her back in to the ER the next day, and they had to ambulance her to another hospital because she was beyond the level of care they could provide due to lack of resources.  Her bloodwork had progress to being well beyond what they see in emergency cases and they weren't sure she was even going to make it.  COVID (and in my local case the lack of proper response to it) overwhelmed hospitals around the globe.  It isn't literally called a \"global pandemic\" for nothing.\n\nThe rest of your points sound very similar to here too.  Ambulances do always show up, but you're going to pay a couple thousand dollars for a 2 mile trip, even if all they do is give you some oxygen (then your insurance will deny it and say it \"wasn't medically necessary\" and refuse to pay anything.  I've seen ER waits of 12 hours here.  Years ago we were at the ER for one of our kids, and someone literally crying out in pain from a migraine was checking themselves out of the ER because they had been waiting over 6 hours without being seen.\n\nI will say that cancer treatment tends to be very fast here in my experiences with my grandmother and my mom.  The rest of it all seems very similar to what we see here, we just often get bankrupted on top of it.",

For insignificant health problems there can be very long waits and the quality of care is often not as good as if you were a full paying customer in private healthcare\n\n2. Sometimes Dr's can be reluctant to send you for some testing unless they are certain it's absolutely needed (money saving) vs in the US they will send you for as many things as possible in order to make as much money from you as they can. This means in the UK some diagnoses can take longer\n\n3. Getting a Dr appointment has become a pain in the ass in recent years. You can only get one on the day, and if you call at exactly 8am, and you basically have to be available for whatver time they give you. Can't seem to ever get prebookable appointments anymore. \n\nSource: from the UK but live in the US half the year with my American fiancee so I have experience of both systems: I wouldn't change it for the world and I love the UK system.

My family would have been in crisis trying to pay for a doctor's appointment had this not been free.

I would survive long enough to eventually get my allergies under control. I was still allergic to every single one of those items, just not as much.\n\nWe stayed at that hospital for more than two months. After comming back home, everything wasn't just fine. I've had countless visits to the hospital, planned ones and the ones not so much for about a decade. The gov. arranged for my grandfathers hunting team to hunt one calf over the allotted amount per season and it ended up in a freezer in our garage. Later on types of prescription formulas mixed with water to mimic milk came around so I could eat my first \"waffle\". Oh I forgot. I also of course developed Asthma.

The delays, the misdiagnosis, and general healthcare worker burbout do not help. \n\nI'll give you an example of this. Our health care professionals are heavily regulated because their bills are paid by the government. That's not necessarily a bad thing because unnecessary testing is a thing.  However, that also means that misdiagnosis happen often too since you can't get tested for everything unless you have relevant symptoms.This quickly becomes an issue for women, who are disregarded pretty frequently across the globe and is even worse when it's women suffering with rare disorders. \n\nIn 2017, I was dismissed by multiple health care providers who confidently claimed my headache was a migraine. I couldn't eat from throwing up, and I couldn't sleep from the constant pounding. I went to the ER multiple times and even ended up throwing up in a cab. They still sent me home after giving me morphine through an IV every single time and told me i was just overreacting. I had to literally have a seizure in front of a triage nurse on my 3rd visit for them to take me seriously. Turns out I was displaying prestroke symptoms at 24. Two hours later, they confirmed I had multiple clots in my brain, confirmed weeks later that it was caused by a rare genetic disorder. They hadn't seen a case like this in decades, apparently, and my case was still treated as something that wasn't serious, even though it was. They didn't even help me find specialists after my discharge, which they needed to (and told me they would) do to ensure my clots didn't give me an embolism and were breaking down. When I finally got a hold of my ER doctor, he had forgotten and sent a letter later that day. He told me I'd have to wait six months to see a specialist. Most major veins were blocked by clots at this time.  I didn't really have time to waste, but specialists are far and few in between. \n\nOn the bright side, the free Healthcare gives me access to my family doctor, who was on vacation when I got sick but as soon as he heard, he started to make calls and call in favors so I could see specialists and start my rehab right away. He got me in to see someone in a week. That doctor immediately saw my blood thinner dosage needed to be increased because it was no longer helping. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my family doctor. Now, if I had to pay for all this at 24 while getting paid very little, I'd be dead. So yeah, the pros far outweigh the cons.",

            "comment": "UK based. \n\nPro\u2019s: Money isn\u2019t a barrier to accessing healthcare. You don\u2019t have to choose between paying for drugs to keep you alive and feeding your family or bankrupting yourself over calling for an ambulance. There\u2019s still an income gradient to health outcomes but it\u2019s less stark than in an insurance based system where high earners get great care and the poor go without. Helps to lessen the entrenchment of inequalities. Fewer incentives for medics to overprovide care to earn more with marginal or no patient benefit. National health service - highly regulated supporting high quality care for comparatively low costs and similar provision nationally. \n\nCons: waiting times for care, both urgent and non-urgent. Care is rationed by queuing not ability to pay (though in private care you basically pay to queue jump). Lack of investment in facilities because budgets are dependent on politics of taxation. Similarly lack of investment in training &amp; workforce planning from govt controlled university course numbers (tied to willingness to commit to health budget increases). \n\nIn general care is mostly good, often outstanding, sometimes poor, and overall people love the nhs. It\u2019s a national institution. But right now there\u2019s been years of underinvestment, waiting lists are really long and people are suffering while they wait (exacerbated but not caused by pandemic). \n\nPersonally as someone with chronic conditions I pay next to nothing for drugs with a list price of \u00a3500+ as dose that I take fortnightly. I see a specialist 4 times a year and pay nothing bad my general taxes. I have routine bloods run 4 times a year or more and pay nothing. I\u2019ll see my primary care practitioner maybe 5 times a year, and pay nothing. I have annual vaccinations at no cost. I\u2019ve just had IVF treatment on the NHS and paid nothing. I\u2019m pregnant and my antenatal care and cost of giving birth will be zero. Periodically I\u2019ll have routine screening done, again no cost\u2026. I don\u2019t have to worry about whether insurance will cover me, or if I\u2019ve reached annual limits, or if I\u2019ll default on my mortgage because of healthcare costs. That to me is infinitely valuable. Very happy to pay my taxes where it enables everyone to have these benefits.",

People that earn below a certain gross salary get \u20ac100 a month from the government to pay for their medical insurance. So it's not 100% free, but still fairly cheap.\n\nI have had half a dozen surgeries, all unrelated to one another. I have had 2 semi-urgent surgeries: a complex bone fracture and appendix issues. On these occasions, the hospital looked for gaps in its schedule (or moved things around) which resulted in getting surgery within 12 hours. All non-urgent surgeries that I've had were planned ahead. For instance, an ear operation planned at a date one month later.\n\nIn the past, anyone could walk into the first-aid post at the hospital. I did so for a deep wound that needed to be stitched, or a broken bone. This is free. However, about 5 years ago, a new law was passed that allowed hospitals to fine people if they come to the first-aid post with a trivial problem. But this fine is just \u20ac50 at the time the law was passed (if I remember correctly). Now, you ought to go to the general practitioner (GP) before you go to the first-aid post at the hospital in nearly all cases. GP consultations are free too.\n\nEdit: to actually answer the question... x)\n\nI started to have belly aches but they weren't that bad, so I shrugged it off. But the belly aches didn't go away so after a week, my mom brought me to the general practitioner. She did some tests and prescribed me a liquid food diet with lots of fibres. So another week went by while I was on my diet, but it didn't help. Some days I didn't have belly aches and some days I did. It was a nagging pain. Eventually I kept complaining to my parents (nagging) until she brought me to the GP a second time. I can't remember the conversation but the GP sent me to the first-aid post at the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, they suspected that it's my appendix but they weren't sure. So they did an ultrasound and it turned out that my appendix was completely dissolved into a small ball of fluids. The rupture of this ball is life threatening so they wanted to remove it quickly, even they apparently, I had been walking around with it for nearly 2 months (when the pain began). The hospital didn't operate on children below 16 years old so I was transferred to another hospital (5 km away). Once there, I was checked in, got a shared room with a lovely old lady, and went into the operation room that same night.\n\nThis whole ordeal was free because children are covered by their parents' insurance.",

But I'd like to share a positive one, with a slightly bad twist.\n\nShortly after the Easter in 2017, and right after a week of gastroenteritis, I developed diplopia, aka double vision. I could only see good at an exact distance from my eyes, at about 25 cm (~10 inches). Everything before and after that appeared doubled, I had to wear an eye patch which I had to alternate every couple of hours, just to be able to function.\n\nTook close to a month of visiting doctors and staying in public hospitals for the results of several tests to finally conclude that it was an extremely rare autoimmune disease called Miller-Fisher syndrome. Typically my sight should have reverted by that point, but the doctors said it was probably an atypical form of the disease, meaning there was no way of telling if and when that would actually happen.\n\nThe treatment required many doses of Immunoglobulin G (Ig G), and it took about 2 more months for me to not have to use an eye patch. Now, if I didn't have public health care the treatment would have cost me close to 20 thousand euros, and that's not counting the cost of hospitalization for more than 3 weeks. And believe me, 20k in Greece is a lot of money, more than 2 years of minimum wage pay, which was what I was getting at the time.\n\nLong story short, I never paid anything for the hospital or the treatment! Not a cent. Funny enough, though, I did have to pay for some of the special tests required to figure out the disease, exactly because they were so special they weren't covered (cost me a total of ~400 euros).\n\nNow for the slightly bad twist... One of the tests done to me during all of this ordeal required a lumbar puncture that was performed at my local hospital. I was to go to a university hospital in a different city that was more equiped for such cases and the fluid was to be sent there as well to be tested. After almost 2 weeks of staying in that second hospital, and after being told several times that the test was just \"taking a bit too long\", they finally realized that the fluid was never actually sent to them from my local hospital! It was still in their fridge and by that time it was worthless. So I had to endure a second lumbar puncture just because they screwed up!\n\nSo take that as you will... Free public health care did help me for free, but not 100% free. I didn't go bankrupt as I would have if I lived in some other countries, but I also got screwed a bit by either bureaucracy or incompetence.",

I was seen within 30 minutes of checking into the ER and I went to the busiest hospital in the state. Total cost to me for all of that: $11, for take home pain relief/anti-nausea medication. A quick google says that would easily be in the thousands in the US. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for our public health system - it\u2019s not perfect but I\u2019d take it over for-profit",

He never regained consciousness after the initial attack.\n\nIn the public setting cost/price/money for procedures/medicine/treatment is never provided, raised or discussed 99% of the time (I personally have never heard of it). \n\nIn my friends situation, there would have been zero cost related to any treatments, procedures or medicines provided EXCEPT the initial Ambulance ride may have had a cost for the trip (if he/family didn\u2019t have private insurance to cover it), also the treatment offered to the family would have highly unlikely had any discussion of cost but just a practical component (we can do this and when, transplant waiting lists etc.), there may also be some auxiliary costs that I am not aware of or experienced myself.\n\nThe universal public health care system here is not beyond criticism some patient outcomes are not great (small child died recently waiting in ER) and some service wait times are extreme (years), we also have a private system which acts as a buyer pays system - if you can afford it.\n\nAs the family, friends and I grieve for the loss of a son, brother, friend, colleague I can\u2019t help but think - would there be an added burden on the family if they were in say the USA? Would that family now been straddled with crippling levels of debt?\n\nWe live in Australia.",

Not looking for sympathy, just telling a story here.  \n\n\nHere in Australia, over the past 7 years, I've had 8 or so family and friends get cancer of one kind or another. Every single surgery, every chemo treatment, all the palliative care and hospice cost nothing. The largest expense for any of us were parking to visit our family and friends. After most of them died, I got to see counsellors to help with my grief, and my G.P. has helped me make some changes to my life to perhaps not get cancer. All of this was free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, dentistry is not covered. Teeth are luxury bones, and if I need em fixed, I gotta go on a waiting list to get them squared away at the local community health dentist. They can refer me to a capital city if there's anything they can't do, like issues with my jaw or whatnot. This is not free, but very cheap, but it's got a waiting list, and most people just see a private dentist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy G.P. has been wonderful, they've helped me make some substantive changes to my life, I'm happier, healthier, and a better person. And I'm still bulk-billed. And my meds cost $7 each, per month, until I hit the cap, then they're free for the rest of the year.  \n\n\nIf a political party was trying to privatise healthcare in this country, I'd march in the streets. If they accomplished it, I'd run for office on the issue of bringing it back. I cannot imagine living with a constant fear of getting sick or injured, and I can only imagine the corrosive nature of it.",

We still have to pay to visit a GP. Wait times are weeks if not months in my area, not sure about others. I have been on a wait list for a sinus operation to relieve chronic pain since 2020. Every time I chase it up I am told \u201cno time in the foreseeable future\u201d. In order to get on the wait list I had to prove I was in chronic pain with CT scans at my own expense. The specialists who tell me that I must wait longer also offer to do the surgery for me privately, at a 5 figure cost. Going forwards I will endure I take out private health insurance.\n\nAs a result of the long wait times for GP\u2019s people just go to the hospital a&amp;e which in turn clogs the system and wait times can regularly be 12+ hours. Of recent this has lead to fatalities. \n\nOverall the premise is good, but executed poorly. This is not the fault of the people working in the medical profession but rather the government ill funding them and refusing pay increases to remain competitive internationally in attracting staff. \n\nBasically, if you are dying they will save you for free, but you should still get private health insurance to avoid living in pain for years.",

It feels like being pounded in the head with a lump hammer from the inside while someone is trying to peel my skull apart from the outside. They are infrequent, but basically turn me into a ragdoll for hours at a time. They have been bad enough to leave me with some permanent brain changes (albeit minor). The only treatment I currently have available to me requires me to be in the hospital and requires me to be monitored (yes I know about triptans, I have bad reactions to them). I have never had to pay for any of the dozens of visits to the ER I have made over the past 20 years.\n\nSometime next year I will be engaging my private hospital cover for an elective surgery of the removal of a large gallstone. The cost to me will be $750, total.\n\nThe bad:\nOur hospital system is desperately underfunded after a decade of deliberate neglect by conservative governments, and covid only tightened the screws. I've spoken directly with hospital staff who were considering leaving the industry entirely over poor conditions, increasing demands, and lack of proper wages growth. Shredding bulk billing only made those pressures worse. The private system in this country cannot hope to handle even the demands of five years ago as the overwhelming majority of private hospitals deal with elective surgeries and much smaller patient volumes. Yes, public health is a massive budgetary expense, but it more than pays for itself in life expectancy and quality of life.\n\nThe ugly:\nI was once desperately ill in the United States and called my travel insurance provider and they told me that unless my life was in immediate danger the cheapest option by two orders of magnitude would be to fly me home. While travelling to the US I have met multiple people travelling to SE Asia to have essential surgeries performed (knee reconstructions, shoulder surgery, etc.) Because it was cheaper to travel to Kuala Lumphur, Taiwan, Singapore, etc., have the surgery and spend six weeks recovering in a 5-star hotel than shoulder the cost of the American healthcare system. Any shortcomings in a single-payer healthcare system are not made better by a user-pays system. Consider that Americans are, on a yearly basis, currently shelling out un the neighbourhood of ten times what a single-payer system is projected to cost. Even if those estimates are off, it's criminal that it hasn't happened yet.",

It cost me \u20ac300 (about AUD500 at the time) as a non EU citizen. Everyone else there was from the EU and all of their treatments were free. \n\nIn Australia last year I was sent to hospital in an ambulance two separate times with suspected heart attack. Again hours of tests, scans etc. All free, just walk out when they discharge you. \n\nDown side is \u201cvoluntary\u201d surgery can have huge wait times, and if you are willing to pay out of pocket without insurance it can be difficult to find a specialist willing to see someone who is not a public patient but also not privately insured.",

After that, he had to stay in the hospital for about 5 days for monitoring. We had to pay $600 for the ambulance fee, but everything else was free. Dad received timely and top quality medical care that saved his life, and it was almost entirely free\n\nAs others have said however, wait times for non emergencies are pretty atrocious. GP visits are also increasingly not bulk billing (I.e. free). My local GP did bulk billing until like last year. I haven't seen a doctor since, but my understanding is that it's now around $30 to see a doc there",

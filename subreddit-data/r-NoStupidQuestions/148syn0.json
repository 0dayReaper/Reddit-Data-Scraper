But most people disagree with at least some aspects of both parties. \n\nI\u2019m more liberal but I\u2019m not a Democrat. I vote Democrat though because that\u2019s the only viable choice that I have had available in the elections I was able to vote. I would love it if a viable third party candidate that had viewpoints closer to my own was available but that\u2019s a hard thing to do because of the system our founders created.",

Because each party has to win elections to get its way, they both have to appeal to undecided voters in competitive areas, so the party platforms are self-correcting toward splitting the vote. When the party wants to appeal to more moderate voters, it'll run candidates with modest positions; when they want to appeal to solid party-line voters, then they can run candidates with more extreme views. \n\nFor example, if a Republican incumbent has a big scandal, a good Democratic opponent would be someone that looks a lot like a typical Republican but isn't tainted that way; solid Republicans are more likely to stay home and undecided voters might switch. If the Democratic opponent is too different, the minority will be excited to vote for him but the same coalition that elected the incumbent might overlook his scandal to avoid the Democrat being elected. If a Republican victory in the general election is assured, then the winner will effectively be decided in the Republican primary, and so the candidate who is best able to appeal to the more politically active and ideologically committed people who vote in primaries is likely to win.",

So the policy discussions/debates took place more within the party (vs having smaller parties with a narrower focus like in a parliamentary system). \n\nSo you had broader-based political views between the two majors, but a wider range of philosophies debated and shaped specific legislation as it was written. In the last 20 years, the parties have become more homogeneous and polarized. You still have different factions, but I don\u2019t think the differences are as wide as they used to be. Because of the entrenched system it is extremely difficult for a third party to become established, and everything is so close that most people don\u2019t want to waste a vote on a third party candidate because they feel it will hurt their preferred national party. Right now most dems feel like every election could be the last if republicans win, so voting third party feels like a luxury we can\u2019t afford.",

Gay marriage and immigration were opposed by both parties in the early 2000s, but Dems started supporting both around the early 2010s to reflect popular support. Whenever a party loses, they will generally take up more popular positions, and whenever they win, they will be emboldened to take on less mainstream issues. Note that Trump is a bit of an exception due to his death grip over the party",

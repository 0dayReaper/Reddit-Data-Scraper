It has something to do with changes possibly being made to the API for third party apps. It really only affects mods\n\nEdit: confirmed they are temporarily shut down. I\u2019ve been in that sub for a long time, and have given no reason to be banned. So it\u2019s safe to assume they\u2019ll be back up in a day or two",

Life is hard. There are so many things that we have to keep track of. It's impossible to do everything in one day, and it's not moving closer and closer to your \"life goals\" every day is not the end of the world.\n\nI've found that, instead of to-do lists, achievement lists help me more. I used to make monthly/weekly/daily to-do lists with high standards of what I wanted to do to make myself a better person or improve my skills. Then I'd inevitibly not meet goals. So I thought, okay, I'll make more realistic goals! But then life would get in the way still, and I'd still feel bad, but this time even worse 'cause I'd think, \"Can I really not even meet my own goals? Even when they're easy to meet?\" So now I make a general goal like, \"read more\" and make notes on when I read more, and at the end of the month/week/whatever, I can see how I did and I can say, \"Oh, look! I finished a book this month! That's pretty good, right?\" \n\nAnyway, long story short, we all gotta be kinder to ourselves.",

Just look at all the people complaining about stimulus and unemployment checks and \"people won't want to work!\" and the protestors who are whining about wanting a haircut or to eat at their favorite restaurant.\n\nI feel that we (and not just Americans, but a lot of places) put productivity on a pedestal, at the cost of mental health (which in a lot of places, mental health care is shit and getting help is scoffed at). Working hard? Work harder. Want to take a mental health day? You're weak, why would you need that. Unemployed? Well tough shit, you're lazy and you need to get a job. The work/life balanced has tipped way to far in favor of work for a lot of people, because we gotta pay our bills, and CEO McGee wants more profits.\n\nAnd then there's people who desperately want to go back to work because that's their identity. They feel like they just can't exist otherwise.\n\nThen people that are staying at home are encouraged to be productive in some way. In some ways, this pandemic has absolutely shined a light on the \"must be productive at all times\" propaganda and really made some people rethink about it.",

I didn't even really understand what that meant when people called me a perfectionist. I took it as a complement, but it wasn't.   \n\n\nIt's basically self-torture. Nothing is ever good enough, things can always be better, and I found my idea of better was usually more about what i fixated on than anything tangible. Because things didn't hit this mark, I was often agitated and frustrated at the lack of meaningful progress in many situations.   \n\n\nAs i grew older i found much of this stemmed from unhealthy environments growing up. I saw people who were critical as being the ones who are actually honest, and the nice people as the ones trying to fool me. Growing up it was never safe to screw up, or even appear to screw up. Heck even when i did nothing, i could still get in trouble if someone was just in an agitated mood and I just happened to be around.   \n\n\nI still have some of those overly critical and reactive elements to my personality, but I am aware of them and do things to mitigate the stress it causes.   \n\n\nFor instance, I totally changed how i plan and get work done. I don't really specify tasks anymore, just goals and outcomes. I don't schedule tasks, i set times to work towards a goal, and i limit how much time I have. It's called timeboxing, works wonders for me.   \n\n\nI also have very simple rules around productivity. If something needs to get done that requires a bit of time, I make sure to work on it a little bit every day. My big rule is to never miss twice. If i skip one day, that's fine, then I have to do something the next. When i say, \"do something\" the next day, if my mood is poor, it doesn't have to be much.   \n\n\nThe only thing that matters for me is making constant steady progress, even if all i can muster is the smallest possible action towards a goal.   \n\n\nI've been working on a big software project for the better part of a year, and some days I will literally just commit one line of code, even if it's just a single comment. For me it's more about building the habit of showing up to work. If i find myself struggling, I just give myself a break.   \n\n\nAt some point as well, I realized the important part isn't the result. It's the process. If you are constantly frustrated with outcomes or yourself, you just have an ineffective process. Focus on the process, focus on what gets you to actually produce. Focusing on results, especially if you aren't getting them, will just lead to poor mental health.",

Rely on self discipline to get yourself started, and once you start to move you'll begin to feel more motivated.\n\nI know this is easier said than done, and I personally struggle with the consistency as well, but this view of motivation has helped me avoid falling back into that deep dark hole known as depression.",

So when I actually buy groceries, cook my own food (vs eating out), exercise, or do my skincare routine, the positivity I feel from that flows into other parts of my life like sleep, mood, motivated to work or go to the gym or buy groceries, and it\u2019s easier to concentrate. So if I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m in a rut maybe I\u2019ll force myself to go to the gym for 20 mins instead of an hour. Or I\u2019ll shower and do the skincare routine. Or I\u2019ll eat healthy. And then I feel a little bit better, like hey maybe I CAN do this!\n\nIt\u2019s so fucking hard though sometimes. Some days it\u2019s easier to force yourself than others. Sometimes I can\u2019t even force myself and have to let the course run itself until something in my life allows me to change.",

The way you think about those things are. \n\nFeeling guilty, disappointed in yourself, and thinking hopeless thoughts like, \"this is just who I am,\" and \"I failed today maybe tomorrow,\" are completely irrational self-sabotage. \n\nThink about it critically for a minute. Are some dirty dishes in a sink really some prophetic distillation your most  shameful personality flaws? No, dummy, they are dirty dumb cups. Is your weakness for pizza a perfect reflection of your weak willed self-indulgent nature? Please, you're not that special. Even vegans need their carboard cashew pizza to feel alive. \n\nDeveloping new habits is not a linear progressive process. You practise new habits within the context of your existing habits and learn how to balance them sustainably. If every transgression from \"the new way\" is automatically a failure that sends you into a spiral of defeatist self-criticism, then yeah dude you are doomed. \n\nMaybe, instead of being so critical of your mistakes, try being critical of your defeatist thoughts surrounding those mistakes and just be overall nicer to yourself. It's really not that deep.",

It really fucked me up. My parents loved me and wanted the best for me, but it's a gross cult that forces \"confessions\" from people while essentially hooked up to a lie detector, so it was a long time before I could unpack it all.

That no matter how much logic rants and raves, emotion is gonna take whatever turns it wants to.

Vise versa for the habits you want to bring in your life.\n\nThis has definitely worked for me in terms of my relationship with food. I used to be obsessed with food.  I thought about what I was going to eat from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. I'd already be looking forward to my next meal while still downing the current one. I think the food network was on 24/7 during that time of my life.  Every meal I ate, I ate until I was stuffed. Stuffed to the point where I wanted to vomit.  I played basketball in university, and when eating pre-game meals with my team, I used to have to contaminate my plate and plates of those around me just so I wouldn't pick at everyones left overs until nothing was left (to avoid being a lazy POS on the court). I knew how bad it was eating right before bed, but it was nearly impossible to make it to the end of the night without going to the kitchen 1-2-3 times, and never because I was hungry. My saving grace was that I was also also obsessed with eating healthy and working out. However, I was always 10 lbs away from my goal weight. No matter how hard I tried, I could never be disciplined enough to say no to food. Once university was over and my athletic career dwindled, that 10 lbs turned into 20 lbs, and even 30 lbs at one point. The thing that started to save me was that I noticed how much I hated the feeling of being full. I would be a lazy blob walking around with no personality until my body finally recovered enough so I could breath normally again. My friends would be able to socialize and hang out after a big meal, whereas I felt awful, self-conscious, and had so much guilt from eating and drinking so much crap that it would ruin my night. I also started to notice how good it felt to eat a normal amount of food and finish a meal without feeling stuffed like a turkey. I began to love that feeling more than I loved food.  Somehow, over the years, my hatred for feeling full fueled new healthy habits. To this day, 10 years later, I rarely snack, I never really think about food, and I usually only eat when I am hungry. I would never have imagined being this person 10 years ago! I love feeling healthy and I love that I sit at my goal weight without obsessing over food and working out. Learning to feel disgust with unhealthy habits and love for healthy habits has definitely been the key to my success!",

So for example, if I floss my teeth at night then I\u2019m more likely to load and run the dishwasher and fluff the pillows on the couch before I go to bed. That in turn makes the next morning more smooth because the sink is empty of dishes and the living room looks nice in the morning when I get up which promotes a better attitude for the day. Etc. etc. you get the gist. So if I make it really easy to floss my teeth - which for me is by putting the floss by the remotes so I can floss while I watch tv - then I am more likely to do the other things I don\u2019t feel like doing before going to bed. Kind of along the lines of formatting your most difficult daily task in an easy way so that you\u2019ll actually do it.\n\nJust thought I\u2019d mention it for those of us who struggle to keep a consistent positive routine.",

When work picks up for me (we have planned shutdown every Spring and Fall) I just totally fall off the rocker. It sucks. I think it's important to recognize that and say to yourself \"Oh it's not me that sucks. I'm not the problem. I'm coping with a bad situation.\" It helps me feel like it's not all my fault.\n\nAnother trigger for me: seasonal depression. It sneaks up on me, I don't realize it through Christmas and whatnot. Then like early February I find myself thinking I don't like the house I bought, my job sucks, why did I go into this field of work, my degree is a waste, blah blah blah. It takes me a while to snap out of it and realize it's the lack of sunlight. It doesn't help that my workplace has no windows. Light therapy helped this year but it still sucks. I just hope it helps someone else to realize that it might not be your fault you suck right now. That really gets me through some days.",

If it's day you want to practice guitar daily, do practice every day for 2 weeks, even if for only 5 minutes. Then your brain gets trained into treating it as a habit. And then once it's a habit you need FAR less willpower to do it, and you can increase the time from 5 minutes to longer then\n \nIt really works. Just that first 2 weeks can be really difficult. But whatever it is, practice, exercise, reading, cleaning, even if it's for only 5 mins a day just force yourself using whatever means possible to do it. And then once it's ingrained as a habit you're fine. I'm the laziest bastard in the planet but I've managed to force myself into habits this way. If I can do it anybody can.",

It is a must for me and I\u2019ve finally accepted it is okay for me to take them - for a long time I felt this huge guilt because \u201cit\u2019s not real.\u201d That being said, understand the process of finding the right meds is frustrating. I took Ritalin for a while (caused major depression) and vyvanse (was even worse and literally made it were I couldn\u2019t sleep, no matter what time I took it). I eventually settled on adderall because it does help me with symptoms with the only side affect being the drop when you come down. \n\nWhen you are going through the process of starting meds don\u2019t be afraid to tell the doc to go up or down on dosage or type. Explorer your options, but be careful because they are addictive. I\u2019ve recently struggled with taking above the prescribed amount because of the stress from work. \n\nAlso, remember meds are a tool not a fix. When you first take them, it will fill like you are on top of the world. Not because you are high, but you finally can follow through on task. This will, unfortunately, go away as you build up a tolerance. So keep practicing productivity hacks and trying to control your ADHD when not on the meds. This will give you a much better chance of success. \n\n\nI wish you the best. I know when I first took ADHD seriously and got on meds, it changed my course of life.",

I was working out and running my ass off about 2 to 3 times a week, lost a shit ton of weight for a little over a year str8. My grandad came down with cancer and it really derailed my motivation. Since he passed I have struggled with getting back in it really hard again. With the gyms closed and everything being so strange from the covid 19 outbreak I have almost no motivation to go. It has been at least 4 weeks since I have even gone out for a run. REALLY readyq to break through this funk and get back to dropping more weight.",

In most places getting fresh air and walking isn't forbidden. \n\nWeightloss is more about food than movement. Not being able to go the gym isn't a good excuse to not get movement and excersise. \n\nYou just aren't in the right frame of mind and that's ok. You know you have the ability to loose weight and that's fantastic.

It has benefits for my mental health and can really help with diabetes and such, but it's dangerous when you have heart problems. \n\nIt's not for everyone and some people don't adjust well to keto. But I feel way better in every way and loose a pound (half a kilo) per week without keeping track or extra exercise or anything. \n\nJust avoiding carbs is the trick for my body. I don't overeat anymore because I'm out of the carb addiction and fat gives my brain a better trigger. Every brain likes fat as fuel (muscles like carbs) and my ADD is more under control. \n\nSo, yeah... It's something to look into if you're interested in a change. It is based on a lot of science.

Talking to a psychiatrist helped me understand what could be at the root of those issues and I see a therapist to help me talk these kinds of things out.\n\nYour mileage may absolutely vary, but that has been a tremendous help for me. Sometimes I wonder if it's had any help at all and when thoughts like that bubble up, I try to be mindful of the last time I didn't do something because I couldn't bring myself to do it. Sure, I've let things slip on occasion because I wanted to do something else instead, but it has been a really long time since I've felt too overwhelmed or too down to take care of things.\n\nWith all of this said, there's no magic bullet. I absolutely need to keep putting in the work to improve myself, but there's a lot less that I have to fight against to keep it up.\n\nPromise yourself that you'll do the things you need to do, absolutely.

Atleast 10 push-ups a day, smoke a cigerette fewer each day, clean up one room each day; that sort of thing.\n\nNow this wasn't exactly new information to me the day I figured it out. I was told something along the lines of \"just do a little bit every day\" for most of my life. The trick was to find the ideal minimum that I could actually do (basically) every day. Here is how it works for me: I think of the amount I believe to be able to do every single day. Then I halve that... and then I halve that again and thats my minimum.\n\nIf you are anything like me you will think it laughably easy once you calculated your daily minimum. I did in the beginning, got overconfident, increased the minimum much too soon and was quickly back at the point of not doing anything at all. So I reduced it... and failed again. And then I reduced it again. In my case it was doing workout, once a day now. A single exercise, just one, each day. I almost felt insulted by my own decision. What can I say though, this minimum I managed to stuck with. I increased it after a couple of weeks to two excercises and some months later, just this week, to three.\n\nI am in the best shape of my life.\n\nJust three exercises still feels so low to me when I think about it, but somehow it has been working. I mean noone stops me from doing more, I just need to actually do those initial 3 each and every day. And I am! I consistend work on a goal of mine, without any outside feedback, each day for close to halve a year now. The first time in my life a have been able to do that! Aside from the progress itself, it's also tremendously beneficial to my mental health.\n\nTo be honest, it is still embarasing to act pround over something this \"low\". Which really is part of the problem. We are beating ourselves up over failure to a point were we have difficulties getting back up again. Three exercises (usually less than 10min a day) still seems too low, but it's working for me.",

What this sounds like to me is that you\u2019re having some trouble with being productive - maybe you have something going on like an undiagnosed condition - ADHD, depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, autism, there are lots of conditions that can make it next-to-impossible to be productive and \u201cdisciplined,\u201d that people often don\u2019t know they have. But you\u2019re determined, so you *try really hard* and *force yourself* to be productive so you can accomplish your goals and be the kind of person you want to be. But this comes at a price. It requires a much higher cognitive load than it should to be able to make yourself perform under those conditions. You\u2019re having to expend twice the mental and emotional energy to do these things, because you\u2019re working against the cognitive deficits caused by whatever condition you\u2019re struggling against. It could be low dopamine, low norepinephrine, low serotonin, too much cortisol, there are all sorts of things that can go wrong with your brain. \n\nBecause you have to exert an unnatural amount of effort to pull off that level of structure and discipline for a few days, because your brain isn\u2019t really in a healthy state to do it, you soon get worn out and just can\u2019t do it anymore. Now you\u2019ve completely drained all your willpower and mental energy, so you don\u2019t even have any left to do even basic things like bathing, so you live like a slob for the next couple days while you recover. It\u2019s kind of like trying to run a race on a broken leg, then *wondering why you can\u2019t walk at all the next day.*\n\nThis has been my *entire life.* I spent my whole life trying so hard to be disciplined. I\u2019d just flip flop from one extreme to the other. I\u2019d give it everything I had and push myself, but since I was working against my ADHD and emotional issues, it took an unnatural amount of effort. Finally I\u2019d just snap and give out. Then I\u2019d be too burned out to do anything for a while. Then repeat the cycle. Then, as an adult, I found out I have ADHD, autism, and bipolar disorder. I never had a chance! I went on medication, which was a huge game-changer. I still struggle, but getting diagnosed and treated was the best thing that ever could have happened to me. It gave me the ability to live a more normal life and do things on a consistent basis I could never do before. \n\nI would strongly suggest getting screened for ADHD, depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, or autism. Especially with ADHD, there are different types, and not everyone is the stereotypical hyperactive type. Best of luck to you, and I hope you\u2019re able to find yourself in a better place soon!",

            "comment": "For me there\u2019s a couple keys to avoiding that cycle. Since you said you were a slob for 2 days and good for a week, I\u2019ll just say you were 20% bad and 80% good for an example. \n \n(I put a TLDR at the bottom)\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t try to be 100% good on my goals every day. It\u2019s just not realistic or even possible honestly. That just leads to having 0% successful days when you inevitably burn out and can\u2019t meet your standards. So in a week, I\u2019ll be something like 80-90% good Monday to Friday and then more like 60-80% on the weekends. Obviously you can tighten that up or adjust based on your needs or how well it\u2019s working. I think this helps me form good habits better while you\u2019re still averaging that same 80% of good over time. It\u2019s also easier to improve incrementally starting there. \n\nAnother thing is recognizing urges and either finding alternatives or satisfying them in moderation. You also should plan this out so it\u2019s not a let down. Like when you\u2019re on a diet, I prefer to have a couple dark chocolate chips when I feel like it instead of just totally cutting out chocolate. When I cut it out entirely, the craving just kind of builds and builds until I just have to have some huge dessert. And then it just gets easier and more satisfying to keep doing it. A few chocolate chips a day fights the craving and is less damaging to my overall goals than buying a cake and some ice cream. Similarly, I might notice I\u2019m really craving a cheeseburger or something. Instead of ignoring that, I might say that if I meet my goals all week, I can have a good burger Friday night and cut back a little more than usual the next day or two. Again, I think if you ignore it, it just builds until you break. Now all a sudden you\u2019ve broken down and feel bad about it so you make a whole weekend of eating poorly. \n\nIt works with other things too, I just struggle the most with eating habits. It could be just cleaning most of the kitchen every week instead of making it spotless or simply taking a shower and brushing your teeth every day but not worrying about shaving, putting on makeup or dressing up daily. Then to my second point, if you feel it stressing you out a little, schedule a day later in the week where you know you won\u2019t do any house work or take care of yourself. Try to clean the house just a little more, and maybe get a haircut and mani/pedi or something like that leading up to that day though. \n\nTLDR: \n\n1) instead of trying to be perfect daily and then being terrible a couple days, try to be more realistic and manageable - maybe like 80% successful every day. \n\n2) plan for moments of indulgence when you are struggling instead of ignoring the urges. It feels better when it\u2019s planned instead of a breakdown and you can compensate for those bad moments in the days leading up to them.",

The biggest thing is that having fluctuating days like that kills your progress and momentum\n\nThis basic formula will help you to be very successful and avoid this pitfall.\n\nA.

Create a morning and evening routine for your work days.  Have it written out or typed out so that you check it off and fill it out each day.  To simplify  I think of it is book ending my days. Therefore regardless of how effective or ineffective my day is in between these two routine items I know that I'm continually moving the ball forward and not letting things fall behind. \n\nA good morning routine sets the tone for the day and increases the probability of a successful outcome, mood, energy.\n\nA good evening routine make sure we measure our progress for the day and make adjustments going forward.\n\neven a fraction of a single percent improvement per week can double your performance output in 18 months. if you keep the routine like this you will be exponentially ahead of where you are today in 18 months.\n\nExample\n\n##Am routine ( M -F )\n\n- wake up same time\n\n- mental gratitude review. Think about the things you're grateful for and imagine not having them or those who currently don't have them. your health is a great example considering their people right now fighting and dying around the world in hospitals gasping for air\n\n- make bed\n\n- no phone or external stimuli for  30 +minutes\n\n- brain dump on a piece of paper for five minutes to clear your mind.\n\n- review the three biggest goals you have.  Think about how great each one's going to feel and step into that. Visualization essentially\n\n- review your daily tasks and visualize yourself going through each one productively and successfully\n\n- hydrate\n\n- something physical even push ups\n\n- listen to five or ten minutes of some music that pumps you up so you get ready to tackle your day with high energy. it helps to shift you into a more focused and sense of urgency mindset\n\n\n## PM routine (M - F)\n\n- organize workspace\n\n- run dishes\n\n- take 5 minutes to do a quick clean-up.\n\n- organize any communications, emails etc\n\n- write out all the little things you did right today. Take a few seconds to celebrate each one.  Even something little as not having that extra cookie, focusing more on the project at hand etc\n\n-  answer this \" is there anything I did today knowing what I know now I wouldn't do again in the future? If so why? \" What will I change so that this doesn't recur?\"\n\n- answer this \"Did I come across anything today that I should learn further so that it will benefit my life?\n\n- answer \" was there anything today that caused me some type of pain? If so why? How can I avoid it in the future\"\n\n-  plan out your next day on paper\n\n- End your day relaxing and doing something you enjoy that's not related to work\n\n\n##Sat Routine\n\n\n- review end of day questions for the week\n\n- review your goals for the week and your progress on each one. look where they went well and where they did not and make adjustments after assessing what was the cause of the success or the failure for the week.\n\n-  do your laundry house cleaning and any other organization items,\n\n- review your finances and spending habits for the week.\n\n- review all your lists of good actions you took during the week towards your goals. celebrate those and know that those are all steps that are moving you towards where you're trying to get to.\n\n\nI'd recommend making a sheet for \n\n1. Your goals each week.\n\n2. Routine each weekday \n\n3. Saturday  sheet. \n\n I would print them out each week and then keep them somewhere in a binder. Filling them out by hand tends to have a more powerful effect in my opinion than if you just store the files digitally.\n\n\nyou may also want to look into the X effect which is a way to assist with this by printing a chart out on your wall and everyday you X off each item you complete correctly.\n\nI have three of them. One for my morning routine one for  my evening routine and one for my intermittent fasting. \n\nReally helps.\n\n\n\nGood luck kick ass.",

Act as if you are the first person in the world, experiment with everything, increase you perception of reality, it will help you grasp the meaning of your existence, and create your version of reality because life is a subjective experience.

Meanwhile if he DOESN'T have total days off/totally chill his routines crumble. \n\nI think its just down to personality wiring, in the end. Some people need more routine than others. I just can't do weekends or entire \"off\" days because the break in any routines starts a horrible cascading effect that has me blearly glaring at empty cabinets, messy dishes, and anxiety within days. \n\nBut if I stick to my routines (work, exercise, house chores, etc.) EVERY DAY... I'm good. \n\nKey is finding what balance/routines work for you and just sticking to it, I think, even if the people around you say you should relax more/do more/etc. Especially right now as long as you're still doing something to take care of yourself, your home, and keeping your head above water, you do you.",

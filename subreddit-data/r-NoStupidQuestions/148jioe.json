There is a particularly extreme case of this in history.\n\nWe get the word luddite from an actual movement in England during the industrial revolution that protested and sabotaged machinery. Tradespeople at the time, who crafted goods by hand, could not compete with factories and lost business as a result. So they attacked machines.\n\nThis is also where we get the word sabotage from. The French word for wooden shoe, which peasants wore at the time, was sabot. They would throw their sabots into the machines, causing them to be clogged up and break. Hence, sabotage.",

Even ancient Greek literature has people spouting that nonsense. \n\nIt's normal to pine for the imagined \"better past\" where things were more beneficial for you (or people who look like you). Usually because that group's success relied heavily on the subjugation of another group (women, slaves, immigrant workers, people of color). When things rebalance, those with unfair advantage naturally feel robbed. \n\nIt's always been lot more acceptable to say \"I miss the good old days\" than something like \"Things were so much easier for me when I could legally own slaves.\"",

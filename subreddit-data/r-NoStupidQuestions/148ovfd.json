This is the same action as the Heimlich maneuver.\n- Repeat until the blockage is removed from the airway.\n\n[Source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-choking/basics/art-20056637#:~:text=If%20the%20person%20is%20pregnant,action%20as%20the%20Heimlich%20maneuver.)\n\n**Fire Heimlich Maneuver**\n\n- Place the victim on back.\n- Facing the victim, kneel astride the victim's hips.\n- With one of your hands on top of the other, place the heel of your bottom hand on the upper abdomen below the rib cage and above the navel.\n- Use your body weight to press into the victim's upper abdomen with a quick upward thrust. Repeat until object is expelled.\n- If the Victim has not recovered, proceed with CPR.\n\nThe Victim should see a physician immediately after rescue.\n\n**Don't slap the victim's back. (This could make matters worse.)**\n\n[Source](https://www.phoenix.gov/fire/safety-information/general-safety/heimlich)",

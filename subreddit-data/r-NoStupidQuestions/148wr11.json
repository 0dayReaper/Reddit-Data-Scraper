We both might point at something that is red and both say that we see it as red but do you see anything like what I see?  What if you see in what I would call smells, or tastes, or something else entirely?",

You could hand him any item of any texture and he could immediately feel exactly what color the object was.\n\nEvery item he identified was the exact color I observed. So unless he somehow was conditioned to feel colors the exact way I perceive them, then I'm willing to bet this is more of a hypothetical thought exercise than anything else.",

Where I see red you see green, but when you see red I see green. We both agree on the name of the color cuz we never seen it as a different color. But we both claim to have opposite fav colors, when in reality our brains are interpreting it into the same pleasing \"color\" in our brain. Always remember... Even if you have seen their life, you have never seen it through their eyes.",

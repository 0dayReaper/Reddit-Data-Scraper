Okay , kindly don't judge me for I'm about to share something which many might consider crazy! see it this way , when I was a kid , i always wanted to be the brightest student of my class , be the best in sports , and be the best in sketching . \n\nI was pretty average in studies but was very creative, and i was good in sports that required strength/height as in short put/ jiu jitsu or basketball for i may not be fast but I could change directions easily. \n\nGrowing up life is pretty dull , I've got into my dream proffession , but my inner energy just won't calm down. I know it sounds strange but whenever I see some building I imagine it in various scenarios as in what if it was a stranded place in a zombie  apocalypse , what if the people standing right next to me were some sort of video game baddies who're after my life. \n\nSo becoming as close as my fantasies as you've pointed out kind of gives me a relief and an immense sense of confidence.",

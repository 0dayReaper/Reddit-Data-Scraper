    "postText": "So I'm watching a documentary on MAX. \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace\". \n\nQuick Synopsis: Family adopts a girl they think is 6 years old with a rare form of dwarfism but after some things, turns out she could be older. Much older. Like late teens/early 20's.\n\nA big chunk of this docuseries is the bouncing back and forth of her actual age.\n\nIs there really no test that can at least bring an estimate to an age? Or like, \"Some body part, under a microscope, looks to be about 16 years old because of (insert science jargon here)\"? Because the girls age in the show is being determined/changed by a few factors that I won't spoil.",

            "comment": "There are tests to do that, they're just not routinely available. For example carbon dating of teeth has been shown to identify the year of birth (give or take 1-2 years). The normal way to estimate age is by the properties of the skeleton because that's easy, but it's a crude measure that might not hold true for people with abnormal development.\n\nWhen you're talking about people with suspected identities, historical documents (like a birth certificate or baptism or early medical or school records) can usually provide the exact answer, even though they might be inconvenient to get.",

A lot of the uncertainty comes from precisely measuring small amounts of radioactivity for old samples, and with estimating the historical levels of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.\n\nThis method is not based on decay (very little will have happened for people currently alive) but on the fact that people born during or after the nuclear testing era have much more radioactive carbon in their teeth than is found in older organisms, making the amount being a reliable indicator of when their enamel was formed. Compared to estimates about the ancient atmosphere, we have great data of the recent rise and fall of this additional amount, which hasn't returned to normal levels yet since the end of nuclear testing.

Also, wrist X-rays can sometimes be helpful because they will look at the cartilage between the bones in the wrist, which eventually fuse together as you age. There are also a variety of DNA tests that can be done to estimate ages.",

In this process, assessment of hand radiographs relies primarily on the stage of development of the epiphyseal nuclei, the increase in size of the individual bones and of the hand skeleton as a whole, changes in the shape of the various skeletal elements and ossification of the epiphyseal plates. To achieve this, there are a variety of methodological approaches based on two different fundamental principles. The methods proposed by Greulich and Pyle, Thiemann et al. and Gilsanz and Ratib rank among the so-called atlas techniques, whilst the methods proposed by Tanner et al. and Roche et al. are classified as so-called bone-specific techniques. \n\n... \n\n- In order to be applicable in the field of criminal procedure, the methods of estimating the skeletal age of the hand developed with clinical aspects in mind must satisfy the demands of a high degree of estimate accuracy and good reproducibility of the estimated results. In the course of the present study, a study population of 92 persons was used to compare the above-mentioned atlas and bone-specific techniques for determining hand skeleton age in view of these qualitative criteria. \n\n... \n\n- Estimate accuracy was studied using Pearson's correlation coefficients, and weighted kappa coefficients were determined for studying the intra-and interobserver agreement of an estimate result. In the inter-method comparison, a basically good agreement was shown between the skeletal ages and the chronological age of the test persons on the one hand and the skeletal age diagnoses of one or of two examiners on the other. \n\n...\n\n\n- No general advantage of the methodological approach of the bone-specific technique was discernible in the course of comparison; in the female gender, particularly, the RUS2 and RUS3 score of the method of Tanner et al. proved unfavourable. For age estimation practice in criminal proceedings, the atlas methods of Greulich and Pyle and Thiemann et al. are particularly recommendable\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23483207/",

I don't have kids but if I saw a picture of her face I would assume she is in like 1st grade. What made the family question her age was the first time she was given a bath and the adopted mother freaked out because she had pubic hair. \n\nHere's the trailer for the doc. I guess I'm just more shocked that just how there's DNA tests and whatnot, there doesn't seem to be a test to scientifically prove someone's age and all we have are birth certificates and ID'S\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vLwy26hbCpQ",

Also, there's a huge difference in her face and body between pictures from when she was adopted and now that she's an older teenager / young adult. She was even losing baby teeth. And her birth mother was found, AFAIR they even DNA tested to make sure they were really biologically related. Also, there were other tests, but the family only showed the test that said the girl was older, written by their family doctor (as in, they only cared about the results that confirmed their narrative). So it seems to me that the adoptive family is either highly delusional or simply assholes. Their prodigy kid status is also dubious, so it might be that the parents are just attention seekers.",

For example the test that others were mentioning about the hands work only under the assumption that the person in question had a normal growth and that doesn't have a sickness or condition that could deviate the variables that they are measuring. Something like bonestructure could be useless with a rare condition because there could be no data to compare and assess the results.\n\nCarbon dating could also work and would be accurate and probably precise but that's an intrusive test that needs the removal or bone or teeth you would probably avoid it as much as you can and only use it under extrem circumstances.\n\nIf you want the exact date of birth for example. It's probably impossible because there are too much variables at play for it to be conclusive. And in any case most scientific methods give you a range of error but they don't tell you because isn't something you really need to know if is something like publicly available.",

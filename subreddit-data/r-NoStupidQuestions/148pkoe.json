Using campaign funds run through your lawyer is.  That's a big financial crime.  Trump is being charged with campaign finance violations.\n\nThe second indictment:  When he was leaving the white house, he brought several boxes containing documents that are sensitive to national security.  Many of these documents are \"top secret\" level classified or higher.  These are classified documents being kept in an insecure facility by someone who would flash them for clout.  Trump is being charged with 38 counts of violating the espionage act.",

Finally he lied to the DOJ when they came looking for the documents, saying that he didn't have them when he did. He then took steps to destroy those documents in order to evade the DOJ. Anyone of these crimes would probably get you disappeared by the government. He did all of it, and its all on physical transcripts. Text messages, emails, videos, etc.",

    "postText": "Tomorrow Ikea are coming to pick up old parts of a sofa that they replaced 2 weeks ago under their 10 year gaurentee as it was faulty. \n\nHowever part of the sofa is at my parents house as it was taking up too much room in the 2 weeks of having 2 sofas in my small flat (one old and one new), will they be okay to pick up the parts I have and then I dispose of the missing part or is this going to cause an issue?",

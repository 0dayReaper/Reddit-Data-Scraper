One thing which troubled me is knowing when and how did you realize you are attracted to same sex and how did you find your patner.  Was the feeling of same sex attraction present before you met your patner.  As this month is the pride month, would love to hear you all stories",

They just looked nice to me. \n\nAs I got older, I understood a bit more about relationships and attraction. For a time, I actually thought that everyone was bisexual (though I didn't know the word for it), but most people paired up with the opposite sex to raise children, because I knew that a man and women were required for that (I had a human anatomy book at a pretty young age).\n\nOnce I realized that my attraction wasn't the norm, I sat on it for a little while and then decided to come out as bisexual in middle school, when I was 12. Despite being bullied for it occasionally, I've never felt shame for it. Still identify as bisexual now, over a decade later.",

I'm a younger millennial but grew up in a rural, conservative leaning area, so LGBT stuff wasn't out in the open, let alone accepted. So, on one hand there was implicit pressure to just date men and pass as straight, but then as a young adult I didn't feel \"gay enough\" for queer spaces because of that cultural pressure to suppress that piece of my identity. So for me, it's less about finding a partner (tbh I'm pretty happy single rn, and my sexuality exists regardless of who/if I date) and more about overcoming the way I've been socially conditioned so I can express my identity more authentically.",

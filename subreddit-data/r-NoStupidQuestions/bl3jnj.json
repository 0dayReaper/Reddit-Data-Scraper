Sitting bleeding out somewhere, wasting away from a horrible disease. But the concept of being dead doesn't scare me at all. I dunno if it's just because of my experiences with meditation or hallucinogens, but I have no fear of it. Yeah, you won't get to experience anything ever again. And that's fine. There won't be a you to experience not being able to experience anything anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nButchering a paraphrase of Carl Sagan, that's what makes this life so special. We're small and insignificant and only alive for a very short time. You've gotta cherish every moment you have. Every time you spend with loved ones. Every sunset and tree and star in the sky you experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut when it's gone, it's gone. Live your life to the fullest. You only get one. If it causes you serious discomfort, it may be worth talking to a therapist to, or at least finding philosophies that might help you frame it in a less terrifying way. Meditate on your mortality, if it isn't too much. I consider myself an existentialist. I don't think that life has any meaning, so we impose our own meaning on it. Find a meaning for you, a goal to work toward, or just something you like to do, and spend your time doing that thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck, friend. I hope you have a good night :)",

This was accompanied by violent global storms.\n\nThe result was an ass ton of elements and simple chemicals ended up in the early oceans. The violent storms caused frequent lightning strikes, which fused more and more complex chemicals until simple proteins formed. These proteins being capable of building other chemicals. Across millions of years of these processes happening, self-sustaining chemical reactions built up into the earliest Archea, which \"lived\" to do two things; multiply and 'feed' off of the chemical soup by breaking compounds in the water apart for their chemical energy. *We have built simple cells like this in a lab.*\n\nThis biological reaction produced gases that built up and stabilized our atmosphere, allowing uninterrupted sunlight.\n\nEventually Archea developed that let the sun do the work for them. These were eaten and coopted by the chemical-eating Archea, for whom they broke down complex chemicals so the chemical eating archea could process them.\n\nThis evolved into early cyanobacteria and Phytoplankton, and the light-using Archea became chloroplasts, now found in all green plants.\n\nRemaining types of Archea then diverged down several paths, one of which was able to completely devour and break down early cyanobacteria for energy. Add a billion years to this and you have simple fish.",

Also cell membranes are made of lipid bilayers, which are able to self assemble themselves that way in the presence of water, so that's probably how the first cell membranes formed. Also Rna is macromolecule which can self replicate and is used in the interactions between Dna and protein formation, so one of the main hypothesis of the origin of life is that the planet was full of these self-replicating Rna (or something like that) and eventually they configured themselves into early cells.",

And my life specifically feels alien to me almost like any life could be mine or like the one I think is real is just an arbitrary selection from many possible lives... It's really hard to describe bc it is a visceral experience or feeling rather than a coherent thought.  But it has that Our Town feeling too like it's tied into death and things being heavier than we realize, and nothingness vs somethingness and the sheer weirdness of how specific life is (that we have bodies, that we live on Earth, that I have my specific body and life details and that I don't or seemingly can't know anything else).",

I was the person who's trapped inside my body and mind, I think I thought (the me that wasn't me) that this world was a prison or I was in a coma of some sort and was trapped here. I started talking (out loud) to someone/something (i don't remember what I thought I was talking to) about how I just wanted to leave or be released from the prison/coma. The part that's still vividly present in my mind is when I (the prisoner me) told the thing I was talking to \"no don't worry about him.. yes he can hear me but he'll just rationalise this all away like he always does.\".\n\nAfter that I was convinced I wasn't real and I needed to get the real me out of this world, I fell asleep that night freaking out and bawling because \"they\" wouldn't let me out. Then I spent the next months ***knowing*** I pr this world wasn't real. Haven't had an episode in a while so I'm hopefully doing better. I'm glad that you were able to get out of that place man :)",

Getting super existential lately, reading religious texts even though I\u2019m not really into that just because I\u2019m so freaked out and idk what else to do. Haven\u2019t even touched alcohol for a while because I was scared it was a sign I was partying a little too hard and that didn\u2019t change anything. Any advice would be appreciated.",

As someone with some experience and knowledge on this I can not recommend it for this purpose, even knowing that it has positively affected many people with treatment resistant cases.

Please don't go off of the advice on here. Really make your own judgment  on something that I personally know to have traumatized people from new experiences, period.\n\nMy personal advice, you won't find out more than you already know. The trial run to lsd, for me, is the question \"am I ready to look at what I'm doing from the perspective of someone who laughs at what I'm doing?\" If you're set in how you view things, I couldn't recommend it cause I'm sure you're likely to have a bad time fighting your thoughts and trying to be \"normal\" for at least 6 maybe 8 hours; you can't sleep either.",

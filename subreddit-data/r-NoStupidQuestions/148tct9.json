    "postText": "I\u2019ve been designing some cute graphics to sell tote bags online (I know it\u2019s very random). Idc if someone uses the art I made bc it isn\u2019t a big deal to me. But the issue is that I was warned by someone that people can take the images you make and copyright them themselves then you get in trouble. I feel like this can\u2019t be true because it\u2019s insane. But now I just want to see if anyone here knows about this? People probably won\u2019t do this to my artwork, I\u2019m not a professional or anything. But I actually have spent a lot of time over the past couple of months to make all the designs and that would suck if someone did this to me\n\nEdit: I also don\u2019t want to copyright if I don\u2019t have too because I don\u2019t have much money and I think there\u2019s like a 80% I\u2019ll never make a sale (especially since I\u2019m not telling my friends irl unless it gets successful). So I don\u2019t want to pay money for copyright and then just lose that money",

If they file a lawsuit against you, get an intellectual property lawyer and respond to the suit.\n\nEither way, it will be helpful if you have evidence of when you created the work. For example, dated photographs of the work in progress, or evidence of when you first uploaded the work.\n\nIf you're worried, start a private photo journal of your creation process.",

            "comment": "Near-death experiences (NDEs) have been reported for centuries before modern medicine. The oldest known medical report of an NDE was written by Pierre-Jean du Monchaux, an 18th-century French military doctor. In his book \"Anecdotes de M\u00e9decine,\" du Monchaux describes a case of a patient who had an NDE after being severely injured in a battle. The patient reported feeling a sense of peace and tranquility and seeing a bright light. Du Monchaux believed that the patient's experience was caused by decreased blood flow to the brain, which led to a change in consciousness.",

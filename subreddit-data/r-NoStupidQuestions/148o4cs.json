The next step is an arraignment, which is when court dates are set and bail if necessary. That is today. Then there is the trial, and after the trial would be the sentencing if he is found guilty.",

The trial will likely drag on for months, and one of Trump\u2019s main tactics are delaying. He also could have the belief that if he drags on the trial until he wins in November, the charges would have to be dropped",

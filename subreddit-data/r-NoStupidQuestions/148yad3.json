    "postText": "There are two awards I really wish existed.  Plus one just for amusement.\n\nOne is \"Le Mot Juste\" (probably about 50 points, equivalent to Take My Energy) -- awarded to a poster or commenter who coins a really good, clever, pungent, witty, memorable turn of phrase.  As in one recent discussion in which a commenter said (of an unpalatable prospect) \"I'd rather give birth to a chair!\"  Icon:  good question, maybe an old fashioned plumed pen?\n\nThe other is \"Underrated\" which would be a more positive and active way to say \"underrated comment.\"  Maybe 30 points.  Icon:  a jack in the box figure springing upwards?  Or a metal detector?\n\nA distant third, with the icon being a compass, would be \"Are You Lost?\" meaning \"this comment or post is a candidate for r/lostredditors \\-- 10 points only.  As in, say, a post in r/interestingasfuck which really belongs (I think) in r/nextfuckinglevels ...\n\nNumber Three might see very little use, though... so I would only argue strongly for 1 and 2.\n\nSo... is it a stupid question to wonder how to propose new awards?",

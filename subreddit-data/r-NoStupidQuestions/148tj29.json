Is it a subjective impression, or have you seen constant and excessive REM sleep on a sleep tracker?\n\nPeople only recall dreams if they wake shortly after having them, so it's possible that you have sleep apnea.\n\nI would suggest consulting a doctor and perhaps having a sleep study to see what is going on.",

Even Ancient Greek democracies didn't have full democracy in the sense that the entire population got to decide on everything.  \n\nIf we take it to mean the more modern sense of representative democracy where the people vote for people to vote on their behalf then no, not all democracies are republics.  Australia, for instance, uses representative democracy but Australia is a monarchy and you can't be a monarchy and a republic.",

There are a ton of *representative democracies*, of which the US is one. Some of these are Republics, but not all - others like Canada or Australia are constitutional monarchies. There are also republics that are not really democracies at all, like China, and monarchies that are not really democratic, like Saudi Arabia.",

However, this process removes a protective coating on the eggshell, and causes them to spoil rather quickly without refrigeration. In the UK, they do not do this process, and eggs can be safely kept at room temperature.",

Other countries do not.  Eggs do not naturally need to be refrigeration and storing them in a cabinet is just fine.",

Some took it as a sign of wisdom, that I'd wait to speak until I had something to say.\n\nWhile you're sitting there being quiet, think of something funny to say. But don't say every funny thing you think of. Let them talk while you think of something that might have worked just then. And use that to plan for when a similar situation arises again and you really will have something great to say.",

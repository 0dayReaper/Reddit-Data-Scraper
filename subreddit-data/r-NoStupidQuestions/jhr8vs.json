I hope you can do everything you can to live a happy and fulfilling life!\n\n\nI\u2019m in the US, but my best friend in middle and high school had just recently moved from India when we met. I loved seeing him experience all the new and exciting things for him here... it was fascinating and exciting Maybe sad at times too when he thought he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do certain things that are no big deal here.\n\n! He\u2019s gay and married to a man now and super successful and undoubtedly happy. I don\u2019t know how people in India generally feel about two men marrying but I definitely think he was able to \u201clive his truth\u201d and be sincerely happy thanks to his parents moving them here",

Metro cities are relatively modern as compared to country side, as is true for any country. But I can definitely say, that majority of the population is traditional. Which means your gay friend would still be in the closet. \n\nAs far as the post is concerned, this doesn't always happen. It's only when you're staring at nothing, and an egotistical/narcissistic person makes it all about themselves. It's very rare, and things on the internet should definitely be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I lived in Mumbai - born and bred. And then around the age of 25, moved to a different country as I got a better opportunity. Thank you so much for your concern, but I still don't mind living in India.",

An important step to becoming proficient in speed reading is to stop doing that. You no longer read the book to yourself in your head. You simply absorb the contents directly. The next step is information compression. Being able to effectively discard junk phrases and only store useful context. Learn this from a very young age and you essentially develop no inner monologue. Like the other poster said I CAN do it and sometimes it\u2019s fun to leisurely read a book out loud to myself in my head. It\u2019s just very inefficient and I don\u2019t do it normally.",

The alternative is to think in images, and maybe there's a third way which I'm not familiar with.\n\nYou don't, at least I don't, hear my inner monologue *in the same way* as if I'm actually speaking out loud or as if someone else is speaking. That would be an auditory hallucination I'm pretty sure.\n\nIIRC studies have shown that our vocal chords do micro vibrations when we have inner monologue, as though we were actually speaking.",

I have an inner monologue, i.e I hear a voice, but not hear hear, like you explained. But I also think in images, and sometimes smells and touch sensations. \n\nSimilar I was talking to a friend the other day who apparently can only recall her memories in still images and with no faces, like she'll recognize faces but she couldn't imagine someones face. That's so disturbing to me, I can recall everything from memories, moving visuals, sounds, smells, taste, what the air felt like on my skin, the vibrations in the floor as kids ran about, the feeling of weightlessness on the trampoline, the ripples in my friends shirt as she fell back to earth. I can even re-experience the fear and feeling in my stomach as I fell after jumping too high (my heartrate even increases when I recall that).",

I can think in clear vivid images or \"movies\", but not whenever I want to, only inadvertently or by random chance. When I try to steer it it won't work. That's a bit weird?",

These are both easy to do in your head, then you add 7500+61, also very easy to do in your head). Probably doesn't work for everyone but I can add much faster in my head with this technique.

If I want to imagine voices, I absolutely can. To me that's daydreaming or internal role playing.\n\nWhen it's me just experiencing the world and working things out, imagining actual sentences would get in the way, like it's an extra step. There's no reason to imagine my voice narrating myself going through the day, with myself as an audience.\n\nI don't know if it's related but I also have a form of synesthesia--everything has sort of a color/shape/character to me (like numbers, months, music notation). I thought that was normal for everyone until adulthood. When I'm thinking things through, a mix of \"feelings\" interact that are closer to visuals than audio, but are neither. You could ask me at any point in my life what color \"2\" is and I'd say red. But that's just an easy interpretation. 2 isn't red, it just \\*feels\\* the same as red. It's like there's a red island and its citizens are 2, 12, s, A (the note), February, Saturday, and so on.",

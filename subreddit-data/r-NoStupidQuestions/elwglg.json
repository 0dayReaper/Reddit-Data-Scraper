Believe it or not, it's working as intended by narrowing your choices via associations, then retrieving smaller and smaller batches of choices until it hits on the right thing.  For example: living thing &gt; person &gt; male &gt; person I don't know &gt; actor &gt; movie actor... and it just keeps going till it hits the right memory trace.   Sometimes memory processes get a little jammed up and pull a bunch of extraneous crap along with them, especially with proper nouns (that was an evolutionary hiccup), so the unconscious process just hands the whole pile of answers to your conscious thought to see if you can pick the right one.  Then you can start throwing logic and reasoning in to help out.  It's a pretty smart system all in all.\n\nIn conclusion, brains are neat.",

Next time you walk into a room and forget why you went in there, start taking slow steps backwards, particularly if you went through a doorway.  Doorways enact a reset on your working memory, and moving backwards to where you were physically before you forgot resets the reset because working memory is always in bed with proprioception.  You get a \"save point\" when you go through a doorway.  It doesn't work every time, but it's magic when it does.  Works especially good when you're tired or distracted.  \n\nOur neurochemistry professor made us all leave the class backwards the day before an exam, and there's no way I would have passed that class without it.  The neuroscience students were easy to spot!",

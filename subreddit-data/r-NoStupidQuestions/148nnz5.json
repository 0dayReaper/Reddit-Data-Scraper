It takes conscious work and sitting with the trauma and therapy sometimes for years etc etc before growth can come from it. The average person who has a full time job or a household to run or children to look after may not afford the time and resources to transform their trauma into some growth edge. I see this even in my own family where that transformation process is so unattainable or scary so many of us just numb (alcoholism, drug use, taking on highly stressful careers etc)",

You become stronger as you develop resilience and grow from having gone through trauma and go through healing. You also gain insights, knowledge, learnings, and growth that you may not have otherwise. \n\nYet at the same time, healing is not linear and you can be triggered and it is hard for the trauma to permanently go away (think Humpty Dumpty). And you may very well live with a bit of shadow over you, even if you logically know that you are more than your trauma, it does follow you through life.",

Like to be honest, most of the biggest insights I had happened after I irredeemably fucked up something important, something that someone without this and that baggage wouldn't ever have come close to fucking up. \n\nFor instance, for the longest time, I had issues bonding with people and getting close to them. I remember two times around when I was like 21 or so that someone told me they loved me, and I had to distance myself from them because of immense discomfort from merely hearing those words from them. But even when I would sense someone was getting to close to me, I would back off and intentionally distance myself from them for a period of time.\n\nOkay, half a decade later and I had some insights and experiences that now allow me to feel more comfortable getting close to people.... And? The insights and backstory of overcoming intimacy issues is... useless to basically 99% of people because 99% of people don't have intimacy issues. The backstory and insights costed me countless numbers of meaningful relationships in my life that I won't get back. That's not an insight worth having in anyone's life if the cost is fucking up a dozen relationships. \n\nI feel like overcoming trauma is just learning to be average / normal again. Like we can use a very concrete example of getting bitten by a dog. Most people aren't scared of dogs. When you get bit, you might now be apprehensive of dogs. Getting over that trauma is just becoming not scared of dogs again, in other words: being average, normal again.",

Even tho my new relationships are healthier now,  I had to go through unnecessary pain in order to reclaim my worth which is something a parent should do for their children to begin with.\n\nYour kids will be happier, healthier and more self-sufficient as they\u2019re raised with love, protection and empathy :).",

People who have faced no hardship in life are fragile; something bad comes along, and it shakes them. They have no grid to process it. People who have overcome hardship aren't shaken. They've seen worse and they're not caught off guard. People who have been crushed by hardship and never overcome it are crushed. It's another defeat, they don't stand a chance, why even try. These people usually have coping strategies that worked well as a child, but aren't serving them well anymore, and yet they run back to what doesn't work anytime things get tough. I've seen plenty examples of the last group, and I've been that person more often than I'd like to admit.",

A minor inconvenience is a catastrophe. I had to literally kick a girl out on the side of the road because she wouldn't stop complaining about how her dad was 2 months late with her $130k Mercedes upgrade as we're driving my unregistered uninsured shitbox with a misfire on 3 cylinders out of 8. \n\nAlso going to high school and having a teacher catch me microwaving raw chicken, thinking I'm being a punk, until I got really mad, like aggressively mad she threw it away because that raw chicken was the only thing left to eat in the DCF house and the gas was shut off so I took it to school to try to cook in the microwave so I could eat that day. The look in the teachers eyes when it clicked that like, she threw away my only food, she was shook. Like yes bitch I don't have any other options I'm too young to work to buy my own food, I can bring the raw meat we can't cook to school to microwave or I starve. I'll take the raw chicken at 12 minutes on high over hunger, that's not even a question. Who do you call as a mandated reporter when the child is being neglected at home but it's the government agency who rescue neglected children that aren't feeding them? \n\nAs a result im married to an ex heroin addict, I can't deal with people who aren't aware how fucked the world is, they seem like children.",

An injured muscle has to be babied, may require surgery, and will likely need physical therapy to get back to 100%. It does not get stronger.\n\nPutting muscles through hardship, suck as lifting heavy, is not equivalent to trauma, but rather to sort of \"ordinary difficulty.\" That will make you stronger. And in fact, muscles that are stronger are less prone to injury, and so too are humans.\n\nThe latter truth, certain kinds of tough times in certain quantities can increase your strength, is what people misunderstand as trauma causing growth.\n\n(A note here, technically the impact of exercise on a muscle could be described as trauma, but we're speaking of standard understandings of the terms).",

There are two main ways for it to occur. By far, the most common way is for you to be put into a situation that your character and skills are not adequate to handle and which you cannot escape. The simplest example of this is growing older. As a young child you are sheltered from the vast majority of the world's stresses and dangers, but as you grow the people around you will be increasingly likely to cease or diminish their efforts to shelter you, thus forcing you to confront life as it really is. You will, inevitably, be unequal to the task and be presented with one of two options. You can either grow or give up. Ideally, this process of removing protection is done gradually enough that we never get overwhelmed and instead experience a steady curve of Growth in which we are always being subtly challenged until we reach a point where we are confident in ourselves and out abilities. The other option, giving up, is essentially a refusal to face reality and instead deny it. The more drastic the change the more likely we are to reject it but, fortunately, this rarely happens. Some people might be unlucky and have to confront such change many times, but on balance it's rare.\n\nThe other kind of cause for Growth is personal motivation. This is the sort of thing that philosophers do, intentionally investigating themselves and the world in a deliberate effort to stimulate Growth, and has a basic perquisite of being able to conceive of the world as being larger than oneself and one's own perspective.\n\nTrauma is neither of these things. \n\nTrauma could, most closely, be associated with the first sort of stimulus, but it's just that. A stimulus. It is *not* equivalent to growth on its own. Rather, it presents us with a situation we are unable to handle and from which we cannot escape, *(if that weren't the case, then it wouldn't be traumatic in the first place)*. Trauma presents us with the dilemma, but it doesn't give us the answer. We have the choice of either Growing or retreating in the face of Trauma, just as we had the choice when faced with the incremental daily increase in Life's challenge when we were children. Ideally, one chooses Growth and becomes a better person for it, but any times Trauma is too much for us to handle and we retreat from it instead. Most of the time this is reversible. With the assistance of supportive companions and skilled therapists, we are able to go back in time and reconnect with the experience, choosing to grow in the present even if we didn't in the past. \n\nBut it is still the choice that brings about the change, not the stimulus for said choice.",

If you're asking if trauma *necessarily* causes someone to grow, the answer is a flat 'no'.\n\nTrauma is extremely complex, and trauma response all the more. \n\nTrauma can either break you, or not. If it doesn't break you, chances are good for growth, though not set in stone. If it breaks you, you can still grow, but it's harder than if it didn't break you. \n\nWhether trauma breaks you or not, and whether or not you grow from it depends on the type of trauma you experience, who you are as a person and how you *handle* trauma, what kind of support network you have, what kind of coping strategies you have/develop/are able to employ, what kind of help you seek...\n\nI imagine some self-help systems or very dodgy counselling systems might claim that all trauma is an *opportunity* for growth. Which is true in the same sense that a plague of locusts offers you the opportunity to plant a new field of crops.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of people who grow from trauma. But there are just as many, if not more, examples of people for whom trauma sent them into a death spiral.\n\nI can't give a blanket answer on this one. There *is* no absolute answer. I have experienced traumatic things in my life. I have been damaged, but I have also grown over time. But it would have been *so damn easy* to have been totally broken by them. I'm exceedingly lucky that certain things didn't go just a little bit worse. \n\nIf we're talking about where my life has ended up due to the trauma I've experienced, I would do it all again, because I'm happy with my life. But if we're talking about who I am as a person... I think I'd still like me without the trauma. And, unless it robbed me of my compassion, I think I'd prefer to just have never experienced it.\n\nHope this answers at least some of your question. Anyone who tries to tell you that any and all trauma is an opportunity for growth and you should be grateful for it is some kind of charlatan, one of the toxic positivity crowd. A negative thing is always a negative thing. You can turn it into something positive, if you're lucky enough, but it is *still* a negative thing that befell you. All the toxic positivity in the world won't change that.",

As a recovering alcoholic as well, I think that helping others helps anyone grow, whether they've had trauma or not; and I think that having trauma or being an alcoholic or going through something, so to speak, makes it so that you can help others in a way that no one who hasn't experienced trauma can. I think that recovery from drugs and alcohol, from trauma etc etc. Is all about connection and when you force yourself to connect with others as part of you recovery and become part of a supportive community, and that can make a person grow by leaps and bounds.\nTldr, *recovery* from trauma helps you grow as a person when you connect with others and get support.",

            "comment": "Personally I think trauma, undoubtedly changes you. Often times in the short term for the worse. Depending on whether or not you can work through or overcome the it, affects how it changes you in the long term.\n\nI've lived a pretty comfortable life with relatively few hardships. Nothing prepared me for my father getting cancer right after graduating high school. It absolutely wrecked me on so many levels. And when he passed less than a year later I completely fell apart. I dreamt about him every night and regularly called in to work so o could go back to sleep and see him. I refused to talk about him for literally a decade as I could never bring myself to face the situation and I would randomly break down at smells and sounds and situations that reminded me of him.\n\nEventually though, I shared a happy memory of him. And it felt good. And I would share a few more and some of his jokes. Finally, now I can talk about him without crumbling and actually feel good about celebrating his memory.\n\nI wish it didn't happen, but it did and it changed me. \n\nI have a completely different perspective on people silently suffering as I did. Not showing emotions doesn't mean you aren't suffering, in fact they might be suffering more.\n\nI also approach grief differently now, both for myself and for others. Encouraging them to talk about it when they are ready and trying to open up myself. \n\nIt allowed me to face my grandmother's passing from alzhiemers in a way that I couldn't have before. To be a support system for my mother and provide a thoughtful, funny and comforting eulogy at her funeral.\n\nTrauma always sucks and and is awful and we can't always overcome it, especially not alone. Damn, mine took 10 years, but eventually I did it!",

I currently have a 5 month old baby and it's the hardest thing ever. Of course I love him, but I've never felt so defeated and exhausted at times. I have the privilege to be a sahm with live in help from my youngest brother and my husband helps so much with everything. My mum also regularly visits and babysits for me.\n\nMy parents were refugees and came to Australia in boats. They experienced poverty, war and starvation so not much phases them now. My mum was a sahm to 3 kids without much help at all and she just did it without complaint.",

There are countless examples of this - clearly those of celebrities are the ones we tend to be familiar with, the late great Tina Turner being just one of a multitude, whose rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-mega-riches story is the basis of not only a biopic 1993 film, but a Broadway NY, and Westend London show. \n\nPost traumatic growth typically requires a person has a reasonable family life, or at least one loved one, usually family, but sometimes a friend who can offer emotion support.   People who have multiple negative situations stacked on each other are unlikely to experience post traumatic growth.  There are always some that do though, especially if they have religion or an equivalent belief system to help them process their thoughts.\n\nSadly many people get caught in a victimhood spiral and/or are never able to overcome their sense of anger of grief about what happened to them.  It\u2019s very sad because these people remain a prisoner of their thought cycles and it can substantially reduce the quality and fulfillment of the rest of their lives.  Often it comes down to them dwelling on \u2018Why Me?\u2019 but failing to see the dispassionate statistical reality of life - \u2018Why Not Me?\u2019 No one is guaranteed a life free from violence, bereavement, poverty, drug abuse etc.",

            "comment": "US? Accounting that layman don't really understand. The NFL got rid of this, because doing so cost them almost nothing, and it was a point constantly used to bash them. Professional sports leagues in the US are typically pass through organizations. To use the NFL as an example, the NFL is a non profit trade association made up of 32 members, the owners of 31 franchises, and the board of directors of the Green Bay Packers. There is no owner of the NFL. Just owners of member businesses. Those franchises are the business that has ownership and gets taxed(besides the Packers). The NFL exists solely to negotiate contracts collectively, organize competition, and pass through revenue to their member businesses. Their hold over revenue is very little.",

            "comment": "Probably because they tax players income which is lucrative, and they tax the advertisers, television station, arena, etc so the org itself can remain tax free because the govt is collecting from them anyways so no point to change? I\u2019m sure liberals in Cali will find out about it and change it though lol",

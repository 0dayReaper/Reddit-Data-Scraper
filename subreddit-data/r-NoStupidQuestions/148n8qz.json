To be perfectly clear, Donald Trump has a well-noted history of spending a lot of time in courtrooms &amp; hiring lawyers who specialize in attacking the opposition as defense lawyers &amp; gumming up the works w endless paperwork.

The people who believe he suddenly became the subject of witch hunts when he became POTUS are often willfully ignorant about his history &amp; turn a blind eye toward what he does to get in trouble in the first place",

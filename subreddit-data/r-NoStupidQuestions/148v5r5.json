And I\u2019m in the unlucky minority.\n\nDespite being an attractive woman, Men in real life rarely hit on me. If they do, they\u2019re usually not my type at all.\n\nMost guys I meet from online dating are rather awkward and boring when I meet them. I hit it off with one guy, and we \u201cdated\u201d for about 2 months. He seemed extremely into me and then he suddenly lost interest. \n\nI had my *first kiss* at 23!\n\nI\u2019ve never had a man truly reciprocate my feelings. \n\nIs there something wrong with me? I believe I get out as much as most people... why do all my peers have way more experience than me? \n\nI feel like I'm too old to be a virgin. But I'm waiting until I find someone who genuinely wants to be with me.... which also hasn't happened yet.",

I rejected people in the past for various reasons &amp; trauma etc, so you're not too old, nobody really is imo.\n\n\nIt's cool you want to wait &amp; find someone, just don't let yourself feel inadequate because of people around you, it doesn't mean you're any less than someone who isn't a virgin.\n\n\nSome friends of mine know I am &amp; are fine with it, if I decide to meet someone or whatever, that's fine, if not, I don't see how that'd change anything.",

Age isn\u2019t important, all that really matters is that you\u2019re controlling your own narrative\n\nAs for your peers, not everyone wants to wait, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that either.\n\nAs for your struggle to find a meaningful relationship, there could be a lot of reasons. Not dating enough people, not dating the right people, or just unfortunate luck. There\u2019s not enough information to go off of. It\u2019s really just a numbers game, and 24 is still fairly young so there\u2019s a lot of people who may not be looking for something all that serious in that age range. \n\nMy best advice is just to keep meeting people and have fun connecting and enjoy that conversation, whether it\u2019s just for one date or months. Don\u2019t worry too much about the physical aspect of it all, when you feel like it\u2019s right for you it\u2019s right for you",

Everyone\u2019s journey is their own, so take what you want and leave the rest.\n\n\nI think you\u2019re in an enviable position. You\u2019re maturing, but not too old, and you know what you might want by now. That always changes, but it\u2019s for sure more concrete than some people who maybe lost their virginity younger. Take your time to find the right person. Enjoy the build up to the experience. Most people would probably tell you their first was their worst time, but that\u2019s because we felt like we had to rush it. You get to manage that! \n\n\nBut also, when you feel like it\u2019s right, just go for it. The first time is never a Disney movie. But it can be fun and comfortable. That\u2019s your potential now. Be yourself and explore your hobbies, meet someone that way. Then have fun. Just be prepared to move on after, and it\u2019ll be a good experience either way.",

            "comment": "I can't answer if it's \"too late\" or not, but I want to let you know you aren't alone. I turned 25 yesterday and I'm still a virgin. I've never kissed anyone either or even been on a date, so you're ahead of me there lol.\n\nI'm not intentionally waiting but I grew up with really strict, controlling parents. I sort of have religious trauma surrounding sex and dating and all. I was never allowed to date as a teenager (I still am not), so out of fear of my parents, I turned down any guy who ever showed interest in me and never pursued anyone I liked. I shoved down any feelings I had for anyone. I pushed down lot of things and told myself it was the right thing to do. Now I am an anxious, depressed mess of a person who can't seem to connect with anyone, even on a platonic level.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm too screwed up to ever be loved the way I wish I could be. I think how much easier it would be to completely give up on relationships and just... I don't know, focus on work or whatever for the rest of my life. Forget romance and focus on helping my siblings and being there for others. But every now and again I see a post like yours and I always think to myself, \"If this person were my friend, would I tell them to give up? Would I tell them they're not worthy of love?\" No, of course not. I would encourage them to keep looking. So why can't I allow myself that same courtesy? \n\nMaybe that's something you should consider too. If a friend ever came to you with the same question you're asking us, what would you say to them? Would you tell them that it's too late to find love because they haven't had sex by a certain age? Is that what you really believe?\n\nI know this isn't a definitive answer but hopefully it helps. Personally I don't believe in \"too late\" for things like this. You're still really young! Why does it matter at what age you find your person? Everyone's life is different.",

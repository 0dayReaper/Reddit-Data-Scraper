I didn\u2019t see or understand talking to or meeting women and I don\u2019t really see how to without it coming across as creepy as I\u2019m not physically attractive despite my best efforts to change to be and women aren\u2019t exactly drawn to me.\n\nI feel like a huge loser and at this point it seems insurmountable and I can\u2019t imagine a realistic scenario where I don\u2019t end up alone for the rest of my life.\n\nHonestly, is it over for me and should I just give up?",

Do you really think having sex is something you have to achieve until certain age? If you want it like that, buy a prostitute and you'll be done. Otherwise just let it flow, live your life and eventually you shall meet someone with whom it will came naturally. Don't let social media or your friends convince you that you missing out. To be honest, most of peoplea at certain age just lie about their private life anyway. And why? Just to look better in the eyes of others who most likely lied about their sex life too. Just fkn chill.",

Even if you dance badly, most men are insecure about this and women will notice you.  Dont go into interactions expecting anything other that to have fun and make friends or you will seem disenguine/ creepy.  If there is a connection, flirting will progress from having fun.\n\nLast option, if things are getting desperate or older is to consider seeing a sex worker.  Thats taboo and frowned upon but there is someone that will guide you with no judgement or attachment and night be enough to kill off any anxiety you have.  It can be your secret.  \n\nFor actually interacting with women, just talk to them. They are just the same as men, the only difference is they get propositioned, stared at, etc a lot from a young age so will have some defenses up to screen.   \n\n  I think its terrible form to approach lone women - if you are meeting strangers,  your chances of a good interaction (or swift rejection and time saved) is best talking to a woman with her friends.  She feels safe, friends vet you.  They either let you in or tell you go away.  Less opportunity to accidentally be a creep.  Dont be the guy that waits for her friends to go to the loo / bar before catching her alone.\n\nIf you have girlfriends, get their advice.  I've actually asked strangers (women) to take me under their wing when I was out in a new city.  I dont betray the trust there and we had a fun night and they acted as wing (wo)men for me.  \n\nDespite what people say, women are not that fussy.  The barriers people think are there are not.  Be clean,  well groomed, have good posture, smile, have fun in what you do, be genuine and they will come.  Dress well - that doesnt mean expensive -  a clean white Tshirt and jeans are affordable classics that look good on everyone - iron your clothes etc",

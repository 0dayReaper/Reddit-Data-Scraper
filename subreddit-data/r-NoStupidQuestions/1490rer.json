            "comment": "What's so bad about population decline is the economic issues. You can't say \"aside from economic issues\" unless you don't realize that the economy holds up the world's society. And the economy is designed on the concept of perpetual population growth. In other words, by design, a period will eventually come that will likely make the Great Depression look like a bunch of rich people complaining about their meager problems.",

Countries like South Korea and China deliberately ran policies to reduce their fertility rate in the past and they have benefited from it (note: now they're reversing their policies). One explanation for why a lower population could improve an economy is the Solow Swan model. You can Google that.",

I even had trouble sleeping that night staying up all night almost getting no sleep.\n\nFirst, Yes this was the same Jamieson  brand. I know it's not meant for sex. The Awaken and feeling the need to work out was real.\n\nBasically, If I took one before having sex... would I feel better? Particularly like hours eariler, about 3 or 4 hours eariler?\n\nI need to clarify this. I know this isn't for sex. But I just remembered this stuff made me feel more \"active.\" I thought perhaps it could benefit me.",

B-12 is a very readily available vitamin and assuming OP is American, the source you posted states \u201cVitamin B-12 deficiency is not common in the U.S.\u201d.\n\n\nAs with most vitamins people take, they mostly don\u2019t do anything.",

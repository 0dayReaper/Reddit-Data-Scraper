They\u2019re going the same speed and same rhythm, are they not? \n\nI just KNOW this is stupid. I apologize.",

The second car will at no point be going 35 if it stays at 40, but there will be a moment when the second car is perfectly side by side with the first before moving ahead of it.\n\nThey just appear to be synced for a moment,  but they aren\u2019t actually so.",

            "comment": "This is a phenomenon called superposition of frequencies. I think that's the right name. When two waveforms (like your blinking lights) of the same amplitude but slightly different frequencies are compared, you get these patterns of alignment and misalignment. \n\nThis is why the lights seem to sync up but then drift away. The lights are flashing at similar but not the same frequencies. You can see this by plotting two waves at different frequencies. I'll post this them see if i can't get desmos to show what i mean and link that.\n\nEDIT I can't seem to figure out how to share my graph on mobile. Here's the site for the desmos online graphing calculator. \n\nhttps://www.desmos.com/calculator\n\nIf you graph these two functions you'll see the type of pattern I'm talking about:\n\ny=sin(x)\n\ny=sin(1.1x)",

            "comment": "Graphics in the 2000 election. Before then it was kinda random up to each tv station but that election took so long a consensus kinda grew out as it was being discussed.\n\nEdit: with Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; By 1996, color schemes were relatively mixed, as CNN, CBS, ABC, and The New York Times referred to Democratic states with the color blue and Republican ones as red, while Time and The Washington Post used the opposite scheme.[15][16][17] NBC used the color blue for the incumbent party, which is why blue represented the Democrats in 2000.\n\n&gt; In the days after the 2000 election, the outcome of which was unknown for some time after election day, major media outlets began conforming to the same color scheme because the electoral map was continually in view, and conformity made for easy and instant viewer comprehension. On election night that year, there was no coordinated effort to code Democratic states blue and Republican states red; the association gradually emerged. Partly as a result of this eventual and near-universal color-coding, the terms \"red states\" and \"blue states\" entered popular use in the weeks after the 2000 presidential election. After the results were final with the Republican George W. Bush winning, journalists stuck with the color scheme, as The Atlantic's December 2001 cover story by David Brooks entitled, \"One Nation, Slightly Divisible\", illustrated.[18]\n\n&gt; Thus, red and blue became fixed in the media and in many people's minds, despite the fact that the Democratic and Republican parties had not officially chosen colors.[19] Some Republicans argue the GOP should retain its historic association with blue, since most center-right parties worldwide are associated with blue. On March 14, 2014, the California Republican Party officially rejected red and adopted blue as its color. Archie Tse, The New York Times graphics editor who made the choice when the Times published its first color presidential election map in 2000, provided a nonpolitical rationale for retaining the red\u2013Republican link, explaining that \"Both 'Republican' and 'red' start with the letter 'R.'\"[20]",

So it was standardized. Because red and blue were already established, it was pretty much a coinflip for who got which color.",

            "comment": "I think red only started to be associated with the left side of politics after the socialist movement in the French revolution, only about a decade before the republicans appeared. Also, back when they picked red, the Republicans were actually the more progressive party and Democrats were the more conservative party. Republicans were founded as an anti-slavery party. It was only later that they flipped to become the \"let's bring slavery back and euthanise the homeless\" lovely folks you see today.",

            "comment": "I asked ChatGPT, what do you think of this answer? \n\nThe utilization of distinct colors, such as red for Republicans, is a way to cater to the human inclination for simplicity. People often find it easier to identify and align themselves with a particular \"team\" when they can visually associate it with a recognizable color. This visual representation helps individuals feel a sense of belonging and strengthens their commitment to a specific political group. By using different colors to represent different teams or factions, it becomes simpler for individuals to choose and remain loyal to their chosen \"team.\"",

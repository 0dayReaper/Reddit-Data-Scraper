Mellowed out a lot as I've gotten older, though I still consider myself having good libido. Its just not enough to see a \"hot person\" anymore. It's all about scenarios or some kind of connection.\n\nLike seeing my husband naked is always a treat but I don't get hot and bothered by it. But seeing my husband do something casual like doing dishes naked? Now that's pushed a button. I don't know why doing housework nude is hot to me now but there ya go.",

While I believe that what a person does while drunk is still a reflection of the type of person they are, people tend to say things that they wouldn't really want to say sober (since, you know, inhibitions and such).

I once told my ex that my coworker and I check out other girls we think are hot, but it\u2019s not the same cuz it\u2019s not her. God she wanted to murder me. I tried explaining for so long what I meant but honestly it just sounds bad anyway that it\u2019s said. \n  People check out other people all the time, whether it\u2019s a conscience decision or not is different. I was trying to tell her that even with all the hot girls out on the street I didn\u2019t want them and was thinking about her. It still sounds wrong, and I still feel dumb even trying to explain. But guys filled with hormones are not usually smart. \n  There is a possibility he was trying to tell you with his sexual frustration he was not giving in even though pretty much his body was saying to GO. It\u2019s a completely dumb thing, but he\u2019s drunk and he hopefully didn\u2019t mean it how you think. \n  The only odd thing is that he was explaining that that\u2019s how guys are when they aren\u2019t getting laid. It\u2019s true to some extent, but is this the usual underlying theme? I was dumb at really bad choice moments, but I wasn\u2019t brain dead all the time I think\u2026",

He doesn\u2019t need to sexualize random women he sees on the street. Secondly, it kinda gives off vibes that he going to use it to get sex from you, ie so he doesn\u2019t get a boner off other girls. And, you wouldn\u2019t understand because he\u2019s \u201ca man and he\u2019s different when he doesn\u2019t get laid\u201d so you\u2019d never understand. Which is also extremely gross.

If you want to scope out a woman or a man, great, do it subtly.\nManspreading. -- Another form of learned behavior. Guys, if you have to spread your legs that far apart, you need to get to a doctor immediately.\n\nWrapping all the women up like mummies. \"Oh, the woman has to be covered from head to toe because men might be driven to lustful thoughts if they see a woman.\" How did an entire religion lose its collective mind? Guys, if seeing a woman walking down the street with bare arms and legs is all it takes, you need to get to a doctor because something is really wrong with you.\nAll these things and others are trained behaviors inflicted on the men at an early age. They are not hardwired into the male animal. Now, do many men constantly think about sex? Yes. To varying degrees, but that's not quite the same thing.",

I guess. i mean, its a tip for a reason. yes, i always tip. because i appreciate the work they do for me. but if it was the other way, around, and i was serving them and they did not tip me.... i guess i wouldn\u2019t care. (and i honestly don\u2019t know why) because you can\u2019t force anyone to do anything they don\u2019t want to. and since their already paying full price for the service? im not saying its good to not tip, but what i am saying is... why do people try to make people feel guilty if they don\u2019t? i was on another subreddit for servers, and the way they were attacking the people who don\u2019t tip them, was shocking to me. lol. but i will definitely be tipping more since i know they look forward to it.",

The price on the menu didn't cover their pay beyond a sub minimum wage. If you don't want to tip don't go to a restaurant that is not \"No Tip\". \n\nYou can absolutely hate tipping and want it to change. Those are valid positions to hold. But going in knowing tipping is expected then don't you are ignoring the rules and hurting the servers. That's why servers are indignant about people who don't tip.",

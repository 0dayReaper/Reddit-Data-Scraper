Battle tactics: guns, bombs, knives.\n\nStrategy is just as much a part of battles as it is wars. You can have a strategy for the war, and one for the coming battle, and for everything else involved. Tactics are the means to achieve the goals of the strategy.\n\nLets say your strategy is to demoralize the enemy nations population to make the war more odious to them. You may employ a variety of tactics to achieve that goal(bombing civilian targets, torturing pows, trade embargos, capturing or destroying resources, etc).\n\nOnes the why, ones the how.",

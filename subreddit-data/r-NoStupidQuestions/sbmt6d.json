    "postText": "I'm Ukrainian and as you might know, shit's about to hit the fan (maybe not? I don't know). \n\nIf it gets relatively bad, we may be cut from electricity, water, heat supplies, so how do I prepare for that? Is there some survival lists/kits to look into? Like obviously we'll need water, canned food, maybe some way to start a fire inside if it gets to that, some way to cook (gas camping stove?), but what else? \n\nA place for excrements in case of plumbing issues, some medication? I have no idea how can one prepare to live in a war zone, and I don't want to panic but I'd rather be ready for at least *something* than just sit here and wait for what's to come.\n\nThanks. I wish you all a peaceful sky above your heads.\n\noh and by the way, is there something to do with the apartment itself? I don't know maybe like some sheets or platic over windows etc\n\nedit: oh wow so many great replies, some people even offered me shelter in their country, this community can be so incredible. Thank you all. I hope it won't come to that.\n\nThere's so many comments, I'm sorry I can't reply to all of you, but thank you, I will try and do my best.\n\nIt's over a thousand replies now so I'm sorry again if I missed anything, but if you want to ask/know something, just DM me and I'll try to answer. \n\nTL;DR: I live in Kyiv. People are split, but no one really wants to aknowledge the fact that we might be on the brink of war with (the better word would probably be 'destruction by') russia. Like, what's the point in talking about it? So we don't. Government just issued a leaflet about what to have in your medkit and how to behace in case of artillery strikes, so there's that. News are bleak, you don't know what to believe, maybe it's propaganda, maybe it's the boy who cried 'wolf', maybe it's a distraction. Fireworks went out yesterday (which are by the way illegal due to veterans with PTSD from war) and I was scared it was a strike. I'm prone to anxiety so maybe I'm not the most objective spectator, but it's fucking hard. You either read the news and realize it gets worse and worse, or you stick your head into the sand and wish it would all go away. Something like this happened before, but never on this scale, they're spending a lot of effort and money bringing all these troops (over 100k) and vehicles (they even had 90 trains with tanks in Belarus out of a sudden) and ships around us. And since the west didn't blink, either putin's bluffing or doesn't care. Fuck.\n\nEDIT on 24th of Feb since people keep messaging me. It happened. Nothing can prepare you to waking up at 5 am from explosions, it was the single most scary experience of my life. People are fleeing kiev. hundred-long lines to pharmacies and food stores. nothing else to say.",

            "comment": "As a war survivor (4 years Sarajevo siege) I can tell you that you can't plan that shit because every war is different, but if you have to, then firstly I'd put duct tape or similar tape on your windows in a triple cross pattern directly onto the glass. If the windows shatter due to the blast the tape will keep them more or less in one piece and this will prevent injury to a certain extent. In case of close military conflict in the area you need to close all the gas to your house at the main valve. Find one of those hanging wallets that you put around your neck and keep all your documents there, passport, IDs, etc. \n\nIf you have any valuables try and stash them in a good place (honestly, I'd dig them somewhere outdoors and share the location with someone i trust in case I don't make it) \n\nDepending on where you live (block or a separate house) and if you are civilian or military, you will need to know the place where to hide in case od shelling, usually underground. Be it ready made facilities or basements/underground parkings etc., and you need to have a kit of items with you at all times: flash light, small radio receiver with good batteries (remember that most probably everything will be cut including TV and the internet, and your only source of information will be radio, high calorie, no expiry food such as nuts, dark chocolate, dried meat, cans etc., candles, a lot of candles, good lighter or even a few of them, batteries, board games, playing cards (sometimes the emergency lasts for days and it can take a lot of time between the attacks), also it would be good to have some kind of small weapon with you even if you are just a civilian. \n\nOne of the things I remember we missed a lot during the war was yeast for bread making. We used to burn books from our private libraries to cook meals, and also burn wooden flooring to cook and heat. \n\nNot sure what your situation is, but try avoiding alcohol, during those times, even though it will be tempting. \n\nI dunno what else to say except that wars are horrible and there are no words to describe the horror that is left in souls and hearts of those who survive them. I truly hope the situation will de-escalate and that you will not have to do any of the things mentioned above.",

Passport is king, but university/high school/education diplomas/immunization records...Anything that vouchers for who you are what you have accomplished will help you get thru borders or refugee camps or visas. If you leave your place and you can carry only one thing it's documentation.\n\n\n2) Fill up your bathroom tub with water. You can drain it as needed for personal hygiene as long as you have running water but always have it full afterwards if you do not know when you're going to lose it. \n\n\n3) go get gasoline. Fill up your car if you have one. And buy canisters and fill them up. Gas is worth more than gold when stations run dry. And they will. People will kill each other over it so hide it and don't tell anyone you have it. You can use it for your own needs, you can sell it later, you can trade it. Cash won't be worth much as inflation is going to render cash worthless. Gas will be the new cash. And if you did put it in your vehicle someone will siphon it out quickly. So hide the car too :)\n\n\n4) go get candles. Better and cheaper than batteries. Can be somewhat reused as long as you keep the wax.\n\n\n5) go buy a tub of lard. It's winter so it'll keep for a while if power runs out and shouldn't be expensive now. Get lots of crackers and if you can, paprika powder. Crackers + lard + paprika = tons of calories and tastes ok. You can also take this stuff with you if you need to make a getaway.\n\n\n6) list is getting long and there are many nice to haves but your life is most important so if you can get one more thing get bags of nuts. Walnuts/peanuts/whatever-you-can get-your-hands-on nuts = calories (and they won't spoil)\n\n\nNow you have water and calories and light. With gas and paperwork you're better off than most people in the same situation. So be careful who you share that with.\n\nLast note to hopefully put your mind at ease, the invading force will go after militarily targets first. Stay clear and you'll be relatively safe. If you find that you must run...lie, cheat and trust very few (if any) as you make your run. Unless there are genocidal atrocities (rare, but happen) you will make it.\n\nThis sucks. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen to you. But you will make it. Good luck to you my friend.",

If they can do this, you can share account and password information. There, you can stash mountains of useful documents. This can be incredibly useful once you get refuge at establishing your identity and potentially help you access your various assets.\n\nWhen I travel abroad I keep a dedicated account that has scanned up to date copies of my passport, license, some other useful ID (SS, immunization, ..) credit card info, bank account numbers, etc. In case I find myself in a murky situation and need them, I have a chance at accessing them. I also keep emergency contact information handy (mailing addresses, phone numbers, emails) so I don't have to go searching around should I need it. \n\nSome advice is to store this sort of sensitive data on Google Drive or similar and add a second layer of encryption if you can that can be easily decrypted (easy doesn't mean insecure) through a simple application given the correct fairly large key. This way should the account be compromised in a non-emergency situation, your data is still secure. 7zip is open source, provides basic file encryption, compression, runs on multiple platforms, and is very easy for someone to use--can even be ran as a normal user so it's very portable. Not the worlds most secure option but if used correctly, secure enough.",

Realistically less so cause you are eithe staying put or fucking off somewhere else and you sweat an move. Know how to clean water. Filter it with layers of stone, charcoal and sand. Then boil the water for 10 minutes. I'm talking a not warm then moves 10 minutes but it is bubbling boil for 10 minutes. I would stock up now. If you plan to stay in place, clean then fill the bath tub. I would cover it after to prevent dust and other stuff from getting in. If you plan on moving out, either now is a good time or plan for when you have to. If you have access to a printer, download and print first aid instruction and how to make fire and water treatment. Sounds cliche but it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. If things are good, and the worst does not pass, you can laugh and toss the papers.  BTW, if you plan on moving, try to be light. The extra weight can do the opposite of what you are trying to do.",

You are not going to be prepared for your house become some ersatz bunker for two sides to spend a week battling over. You could even end up the victim of a sides war crimes if they decide to inflict any on you.\n\nEven less direct risks: you\u2019re not going to have police protection. A group of thugs could show up in the middle of the night and inflict all manner of horrors. If any of your family needs medical attention because of basic medical events (maybe they have a heart condition and take medications), what is just a visit to the doctor and a day of inconvenience becomes a life or death situation as all you can do is sit in your dark, cold, waterless house and pray. \n\nRead up about those who lived in war zones in relatively recent times, like the Bosnian conflict or the Syrian civil war. A war zone is not the place you want to be. There\u2019s people who survive them, sure, but it\u2019s downright *terrifying and traumatizing* under the best of circumstances. \n\nOP, if you\u2019re somehow reading this comment and HappyBreezers comment, make arrangements to leave *yesterday.* If anything, I would be researching how to protect and hide priceless family possessions so you can hopefully go back one day to retrieve them (for example, photos that aren\u2019t digitized, heirlooms too large to bring with you like paintings, etc).

In those cases you will need to be prepared to leave immediately, likely on foot. Other posters have covered that well. \n\nWhat you can do is prepare for extended periods without basic amenities. Food, water, lighting, warmth and sewage should be priorities, but also find yourself a means to stay informed and communicate with loved ones and to keep yourself entertained. What a lot of people don't realise is that war is very boring most of the time. You often can't go out to work or to entertain yourself. Once you get past the initial shock, you will get used to the constant anxiety to some extent and you will be bored, even during the most intense events. My fiancee lived in Aleppo during the civil war in Syria and was trapped in her office during a rocket attack for 8 hours. Keeping your mind occupied during such times is important.\n\n\nEdit: just spoke to her. She says to get digital copies of all of your important documents and keep the originals in a bag by the door. You should also know that the UN won't register you as a refugee while you remain in the region of conflict, so have a plan to leave the country if it comes to that. Feel free to reach out if you have further questions. Best of luck.",

This is what I learned from 2011-2014:\n\n1- Save a lot of drinking water and canned food.\n2- Tape on the glass windows will make the shattering much more safe and less messy.\n3- Car battery would help you keep power saving lights on.\n4- Hide your valuables and cash somewhere not obvious.\n5- Keep the beds away from the windows.\n6- If you take meds, stock up.\n7- Avoid rooftops and balconies if you hear something like shooting or bombing.\n8- Sometimes walking is a much better way to stay safe than running. This is a very important thing that not many people talk about. If the masses are running, joining them isn't the best idea. Walking away could save your life. It saved mine. Chasers and shooters focus on runners. Unless we're dealing with a sniper.\n9- Stock up on wet wipes. They can help a lot if water is cut off for days.\n10- Avoid arguments with the family. Mental health would not take both war and family fights.\n\nI never wished to give such pointers to anyone and I hope you'll never need them. I'm sorry.",

You can usually assume that you'll be able to find water and shelter, so select for water purifying, one change of clothing, and food. Make sure you include a fire starter, radio, knives, and light. \n\nOnce that's done, stockpile cured meats, canned goods, and bottled water. Once you have a couple of weeks of that, expand to longer term storage. Barrels of water, rice, wheat, etc. Don't neglect fuel for cooking and a method to cook. I recommend a volcano grill or similar that can use multiple fuel sources.",

Most deli cured meats you get in modern countries aren't really fully cured and need to be refrigerated. They last weeks *at best.* Be very careful about which you buy and assume will last.\n\n*Dried* Meats, hard sausages, smoked fish and meats (smoked hard, not the cold smoked soft meat) are more likely to last.\n\nAlso, if you can get a large block of hard cheese, wrapped in some simple cloth or dipped in wax, it stays even at room temperature for a long time.",

Preperations mean nothing if a 2000 pounder lands anywhere near the block you live on. Or random mortar or missile attacks to harass normal day living. Before even prepping, why not look long and hard on why you should stay.  Whats keeping you in that location that you cant do elsewhere?  If war doesnt break out, you can always come back.  I would recommend figuring out a place you can go first and make a plan to get there and what you'll do when you get there.  Then stock up on canned goods, water, basic medical kit, and a way to cook food.  A water purification system of some kind is great as well but should not be used to bunker down with.  If your infastructure cant provide water and your running low on it, then that should be a good sign to leave.  Just my 2 cents since no one seems to be mentioning that a war zone is significantly different from just a failure of infrastructure or extended camping trips.",

It may help prevent soldiers (from both sides) targeting your house on purpose, but sadly, nothing will help prevent stray shots.\n\nIf you have a basement/root cellar and there's room enough, place some sleeping bags down there, a space heater, some bottled water, and some dried food. If fighting starts near you, get in there and stay in there.\n\nSupplies should include food, blankets, bottled water, warm jackets, warm boots, gloves, warm hats, socks, a backpack for each family member, flash lights and batteries, Copies of your personal identification (Driver's licenses, passports, school IDs, anything), matches, a hatchet for cutting wood, aspirin/basic pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\nI'd be careful with anything that is a weapon. While it may help protect you from your neighbors or other refugees seeking to take advantage of your situation, it may also mark you as a potential danger/combatant and could get you shot. In numerous wars, civilians with rifles were often seen as francs-tireurs or partisans and often arrested, executed, or driven away. This is generally frowned upon and often considered a war crime (unless you can prove that the partisan was shooting at you), but that's not much help for you, when you're shot just because you had a hunting rifle strapped to your back.\n\nYou want to make sure you can carry things and still walk, so don't over pack. But you need enough supplies (food and water) to get to somewhere \"Safe.\" That's going to depend wildly on where you are and how far you can walk. Ideally you can just stay in your home and avoid trouble, but worse case scenario, you need to leave.\n\nIt's winter there, and I live in Minnesota so I know a bit about cold winters. I won't go too much over it, you know it as well, but warm clothes, layers, jackets, and good gloves/mittens will go a long way in the cold. Avoid getting wet, and if your feet get wet, find a place to stop ASAP and get them both dry and warm. You may need to have multiple pairs of socks to prevent both frostbite as well as trench foot (a condition where the foot is trapped in cold, wet conditions and acquires a variety of terrible diseases and potentially can cost you your foot or even life).\n\nFinally, stock some cash somewhere. If not Cash, jewelry. Something light, portable, and valuable. You may need it to trade, barter, or bribe your way past checkpoints or to protect yourself or your family.",

Do not stay if your \"spidey-sense\" is telling you there is going to be an \"incursion\".  Take things that are irreplaceable. \n\nJust to put in in perspective, 20k-250k worth of munitions can be used to eliminate one target.  That's a lot, and not something you want to see, hear, or be even relatively close to, as a civvie.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope its more sabre-rattling that anything.",

If you check the news every day and see that people actually die on the front lines *every fucking day*, you either get numb or probably go crazy. I live in Kyiv so *even if* the full out assault starts we will probably be relatively safe here, but no one knows. \n\nI didn't really believe it's going to be this bad until US and Germany started evacuating diplomatic families. If it had come to that, I think they believe it may actually start. People in general are 50-50, what's the point in panicking, we have no place to go either way. But if the panic starts, I don't want to go buy my water bottles *then*, it's already too late. So atm I just pick some 'survival' stuff each time I go to the shops, a few cans of food or some water and tape. If I'm wrong and being paranoid for no reason, be it, this stuff won't go bad over night and I don't mind spending a few hundred bucks to feel at least a bit safer. \n\nI know this may sound stupid, but you in the west only get like 10% of the actual news that happens over this conflict, and we have 24/7 coverage and shit gets worse and worse every day unfortunately.

            "comment": "I\u2019m certainly not an expert, and you\u2019ve gotten some good answers here so far! I wanted to add that in addition to planning for short term survival stuff in the event that water and electricity is cut out, I would plan for several months of difficulty getting most goods. \n\nSo for example, if the power were to suddenly go out and you were unable or unwilling to go outside, you of course want foods you can eat without cooking (lots of peanut butter and crackers would be good, applesauce, soups, granola bars, etc.) plenty of water, and I would probably prioritize warm clothing and maybe a small tent over a way to start a fire inside. An indoor fire can become quite dangerous. \n\nBut in addition to that stuff, sit down with your family and talk about what the necessary items are that you use over six months time, that would be very difficult or dangerous to go with out. Here I\u2019m talking about filling prescription medications for example, and ask for a three month supply maybe. Do you have women in the home who need to stock up on menstrual products? Do you need to stock up on birth control or condoms? Toilet paper, soap, trash bags, these are the types of things that might be tricky to get later if there are supply chain issues due to a conflict. \n\nIf you have children in the house, go grab plenty of crayons and coloring books, puzzles, legos, etc. the types of things that can occupy a lot of time if school is canceled. For adults, maybe get some board games like monopoly, chess, or checkers. Mental health is an important aspect of your wellbeing.  \n\nAnd then on an even more sobering note, I think anytime you anticipate conflict, you must be willing and equipped to walk a long distance. It could be to stores because gas is hard to come by, or it could be to another town, or even further\u2026. Make sure everyone in the family has good shoes, a new pack of socks that you do not open unless you have to leave, back pack for supplies, and a tent.",

Be cautious with this though, as it's a bit of a compromise. If you barricade too much, you might send the signals that you've prepared a fighting position. \n\nConsider your escape plan if the building's integrety is threatened. Make sure you have smoke alarms with batteries in them, and that everyone in the family knows where the emergency is. Make sure every bed in the household has an electric torch next to it, and a spare set of batteries.\n\nBottled water will only last so long. Also invest in some filters and some means of purifying water. This could be puri-tabs, iodine, boil and condensing it. Water should be one of your biggest priorities. Cholera and other waterborne diseases were one of the most dangerous aspects of the US campaign against Iraq.\n\nIf you'll be cooking by unfamiliar means indoors (like a camping stove) have a fire extinguisher to hand.\n\nMake sure you have a decent first aid kit in the home, and know roughly how to use it.\n\nMake sure all mobile phones are charged fully whilst the electricity is on. If it goes off, make sure that the phones are only used for necesary comms. Switch off unneeded services such as bluetooth and GPS (when not out and about). \n\nIf you need to navigate, try to have a paper based map, and some knowledge of how to read it. GPS may or may not work under conditions of foreign military occupation.\n\nIf you have a vehicle, make sure it's serviced, full of fuel and used to bare minimum, as you don't know when fuel will become scarce.\n\nDo your best to avoid getting caught up in the panic buying and stampedes at shops, as most likely the civil police have got their hands waaay full at the moment.",

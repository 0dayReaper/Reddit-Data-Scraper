Also, depending on your insurance you might need a referral from your primary doctor. Calling the number on the insurance card would likely be a good first step tooanswer those 2 questions: 1) is a referral needed? 2) what providers are in network and close to you.",

            "comment": "When people say check with your insurance first, what they mean is see if your plan requires you to have referrals. If it does, you need to see your GP or if you have something like MyChart, you can do a referral request. If your plan does not require referrals, then you can just choose what doctor you want, call and make an appt. Almost all clinics now have websites and they will have a section about insurance policies. Look there to see if they take your insurance. You can ask the clinic or your insurance to see if they are in network. Insurance will still cover visits at an out of network provider but not as much as if you\u2019d go in network. You can get some good discounts for staying in network but some people are restricted by location or speciality and all that is available is out of network.",

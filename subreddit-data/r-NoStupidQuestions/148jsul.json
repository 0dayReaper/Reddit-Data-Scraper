    "postText": "Hello-\nI have anxiety. I have generalized anxiety which manifests a lot in social situations and is definitely aggravated by change. Last weekend was really bad. I was applying for a job and planning/ managing my approach to my current job, and I was so physically uncomfortable. It was hard to go to work on Monday. It\u2019s like the flying monkeys from wizard of oz, and I\u2019m being attacked. I want a magic wand to feel better but nothing helps. \nWith the help of my therapist, I\u2019m working on an anxiety tool kit. Something to read/ things to do to help manage the anxiety and slowly feel better. Any ideas or suggestions?",

    "postText": "I live in usa. I got a booster last september 2022. I just honestly don't understand the instructions on the government website. It says everyone should get the latest and you only need the one now regardless of whatever happened before. Am I allowed to just go get another one if I want? Or was the last booster the last one (that was my 4th shot) and that's it, no more?\n\nHonestly I'm not afraid but I mean if they are giving them out free I'll take another one. I am not the kind to look a gift horse in the mouth. I'm the kind of guy that fills up my health meter at every opportunity when playing a video game, that's just who I am. Although I probably would wait until the fall tbh, like you do with the flu shot.\n\nEdit: I am asking if *I'm allowed to,* not advice on if I should get one or not. I'll decide that later. IOW I am asking are you capped at 4 shots or can you get 5+ as a regular adult?",

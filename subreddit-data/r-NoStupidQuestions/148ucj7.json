    "postText": "I've been dealing with one ex watching my social media for months now. We didn't end on good terms, and he was actually pretty nasty towards me so I haven't spoken to him again. He has multiple accounts, which have all been blocked. My social media for the most part is private at this point, but I keep my Instagram public for business purposes. I keep catching him looking at my Instagram stories from a newer page and he ends up re-blocking me from that one afterwards. It won't let me block him back because it immediately says \"user not found.\" It feels really uncomfortable and I've stated multiple times that I'd just like to move on. \n\nHow would you guys deal with this? Going private is an option but it will affect my business. But I'm open to anything.",

He kept making new accounts and new phone numbers and emails. It's ridiculous the lengths they go to keep some sort of connection. I hope it gets better for you!",

You could try ratting him out to his mother or current partners if they are stable people with actual influence on him.\n\nMake a post on your state or country legal advice subreddit (or consult an actual lawyer). The standards for what is considered harassment varies wildly, but depending on your location you may be able to get a restraining order before those criteria are met. \n\nUnfortunately an RO won't prevent him from escalating if he's the sort to do so. He may even cite is as the (bullshit) reason he did so. What it does do is give you a means to get the police to intervene severely once he does something \"scary\" rather than having to wait for \"actively dangerous.\"",

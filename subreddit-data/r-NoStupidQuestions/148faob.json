    "postText": "I'm a bit behind the times, but am wondering what the big fight over gender affirming care is about. Almost all states have laws prohibiting a person from getting a tattoo until they're 18 years old, so it does not necessarily seem out of the ordinary for states to ban medical procedures that can substantially affect a person's body or those that are non-reversible. Can somebody enlighten me? And, kindly do not send harsh, judgmental statements my way. I am not a troll, just completely ignorant about trans people and trying to learn.",

(after lots of follow-up with doctors and plus all the other treatments for gender/body dysmorphia that aren't pharmaceutical or surgical)\n\n\nThe right is conflating all types of gender reaffirming care with bottom surgery.",

They have been used on cis kids for decades to treat precocious puberty and those kids got off the blockers when they would normally start puberty. That says nothing of the safety for kids using them to prevent puberty lmao",

Go on ANY website from a trusted healthcare provider : puberty blockers are not without risks, sure, but once stopped, puberty resumes.\n\nThe damage from not providing gender care is bigger than any side effect of puberty blockers. There is a reason why suicide rates are so hight amongst trans children. \n\nAlso, not a lot of people detransitiion. Those are the exception. Anti-trans only use this exception to justify withdrawing care from all of them. \n\nStop being lazy in your arguments. Please read on how gender affirming care work. No, you don't just go and see a doctor and get your genitals altered the day after. No, doctors won't just push a kid to take hormones just for fun. This is just anti-trans propaganda.",

The states banning trans care for minors don't have an exemption for parent permission because their real goal is to make the treatment unavailable even if a kid, their parents, their psychologist, and their health care provider all agree it is best for them. \n2. Minors are not banned from getting nose jobs and boob jobs. Those happen all the time. I think it's a terrible idea for a minor to get cosmetic surgery, but if parents and doctors agree, I don't think it's my business or the government's business. \n3. For some trans kids, puberty is devastatingly traumatic. Imagine knowing inside that you are one gender, feeling that in your core, fighting for that life. You have known for years. Then you see your body changing in ways that will take much more invasive surgery to fix. You grow breasts, or your voice deepens, which is usually irreversible. There are some potential side effects of puberty blockers, but they can buy people time while they figure out their gender identity and they are only prescribed under the guidance of doctors. \n4. In general, parents have power to decide medical care for their kids as long as they don't threaten their life. They can decline vaccinations, use essential oils instead of antibiotics, decline cochlear implants for Deaf children, etc. Why are we uniquely getting involved in the medical care of trans people?",

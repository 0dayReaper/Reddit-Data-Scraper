    "postText": "I don't know where to ask this, if this goes against the rules, if it's stupid, but here we go. \n\n\\-I always tell people what they want to hear. No matter what my real opinion is, what I truly think, I always tell them what at least I think they want to hear. To an extreme. My friend is constantly cheating on her boyfriend or at least trying to. Her boyfriends is a wonderful person. Do I tell her she's an awful person? No, because I don't want her to be upset or to be angry at me. I just listen to her. \n\n\\-I always try to make people feel better about themselves. My family is constantly trying to put me down (Your hair looks so ugly today, what did you do? or You've gained weight, haven't you?) but do I tell her that she bleached it so much it looks awful and she looks almost bald? No, I just think of it because I don't want her to feel bad although she's making me feel bad about mine.  \n\n\\-When we are in groups of people and one person is telling a story and everyone else starts to talk about something else I look at that person and tell them to finish their story, the same things happens when I see someone getting ignored, I always try to make everyone feel welcome. This is because of the amount of times people take me for granted or just straight up ignore me, I know the feeling and it sucks so that's why. \n\n\\-When someone asks me for a favor, I do it. No questions asked. If I don't have the time or the money for it, I do the best I can to do it anyways. \n\nI can't think of more examples but lately I've been thinking if this qualifies as people pleasing or not.",

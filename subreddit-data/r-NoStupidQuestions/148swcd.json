    "postText": "To keep things simple, I\u2019ve spent the past 2 years putting most my time and effort into tennis. However, recently I\u2019ve found a career program that I really want to join. The program requires the participant to be in good physical condition and while I\u2019m not sure how good, I sort of have an idea. As for me, i have decent stamina and have done some weightlifting in my free time, but I\u2019m still pretty skinny (140~ lbs @ 5\u201910). My current routine involves a 2 mile bike ride, some cardio, and some compound exercises. Can I make reasonable progress in such a short time?",

They will follow you and adapt the program with your progress. \n\nYou can have progress with any program given enough time, but considering you only have 4 months and are the skinny type, I'd look into something tailored for yourself.",

The fact is, any pro-human effort is regarded as revolutionary by the right wing, and inspires fear on their part (what if I loose something because they got something? ) to which they react negatively. They never move toward the future,  they have no real goals, they only want to fight or flee. Paper tigers indeed.",

Some of these people literally expend all their energy being mad that LGBTQ people are so vocal, despite not even knowing any. Like...I can't even imagine the mindset of someone who does not know a single gay or trans person, yet spends hours of their life reading conservative \"horror stories\" about them, then spends like 50% of their conversations complaining about them, with the usual \"back in MY day!\" stuff without ever bothering to listen/ consider the other side. Everything they say is a fear based reaction to something unfamiliar to them. There is no 'end game' or plan. There's no proposed policy or solutions, just reactionary fear and anger. Then they go vote for people who vocalize that fear and anger. These are people who pathologically seek out things to be upset about and frankly, would benefit from extensive therapy. They just aren't self aware enough to realize they have mental health problems and need therapy, so will never seek it. I know it sounds rough but I grew up with and know these people and have been around them long enough to observe this behavior for years. It's my honest assessment of them. That's why you can't really reason with them, because when you try, what you're asking them to do is to re-evaluate the stuff that they're afraid of and to consider that it really isn't so scary. In order to successfully do this, they'd have to be aware that their fear is unreasonable and be open to working on it and most of them just aren't. I wish I knew the solution and how to approach them but I just don't.",

Going down the line of what I can recall it was \n\n- Communism and the red menace for quite a long time.  Up until the Berlin Wall fell.\n\n- then the middle East was supposedly full of nothing but suicide bombers that wanted to destroy your way of life through terrorism.\n\n- Hispanics who are coming over the border illegally taking your jobs and spreading crime and selling drugs.\n\n- now it's the LGBTQ which despite being a small community conservatives want you to believe for some unknown reason wants to turn your children gay too.\n\n- lest we forget black people who have always been portrayed as thugs and criminals since the 60's.\n\nAll of them bear sliver of truth (except the LGBTQ) but the conservative use fear to blow it way out of proportion and make you hate that group instead of looking to society to see the flaws in the system and ourselves.  It's much easier to say \"they caused all my problems.  They need to be stopped\" instead of working to fix the problem with yourself or your gov.",

They weren't European, spoke a different language, and followed different customs. Religion soon added a further dynamic as their beliefs were seen as in opposition to Christianity (since Jews don't believe Jesus was the true Messiah) with many in the Church citing Jews as the true murderers of Jesus.\n\nPolitics also played a massive part. Traditional Christianity forbade the practice of taking interest on loans as it was seen as \"unchristian\". Jews, however, were free to do so, and many became quite wealthy via banking and trade. This created a Jewish upper class in many regions, especially modern-day Germany, France, and Poland, which was resented by the landed nobility, whose wealth came from land and titles.\n\nFrom the 1800's on, the rise of nationalism (the idea of unified nations of the same peoples, not what we consider nationalism) pushed for a France for the French, a Germany for Germans, etc. Jews were in a somewhat awkward spot, as they were culturally non-European. They were closest to Germans, however, due to speaking Yiddish, a German Dialect spoken by European Jews. Had you asked someone in the Victorian Era which country would have been most likely to commit the Holocaust, most would have guessed France. Anti-Semetism only really picked up to dangerous around WW1, initially cause of oppression in France (read: Dreyfus Affair) and then during and after the war because of Britain pushing for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine as a way to undermine the Ottoman war effort. Many Jews objected to the war or chose not to fight (though a massive amount did) and this was used as propoganda by the German army to claim them as backstabbers, with the Communist uprising in Bavaria adding further fuel to the fire since many members were Jewish, as was Trotsky in the Soviet Union. Even when Hitler was in power, many in Poland, Britain, and France liked his ideas of Jewish deportation and ideas for a Jewish state in Madagascar were tossed around among others.\n\nModern Nazis are still succeptible to this same propoganda. Isolated sub-groups, especially cultural or linguistic, tend to draw suspicion from the majority, especially when they are perceived as refusing to assimilate.\n\nEDIT: Something that I forgot to add which is also relevant. In 1903 a  book was released in Russia called \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". The book was one of the earliest feats of modern published propoganda. It basically claimed to be secrets of a Jewish cabal working behind the scenes of all the most powerful and wealthy in order to rule the world. It was immensely popular with old-school nobles who resented the nouveaux riches (despite Many Jewish families being rich for longer than said old-school nobles) and was taken as gospel by many. That book is considered a huge force in shaping the mindset of Europe leading up to Hitler.",

Firstly, it didn't begin as aggressively as it is currently happening nowadays. In the beginning they were simply refugees for the most part looking for a new home. The sheer numbers pushed the Palestinians from several cities. It was a bit like how Americans conquered much of Texas in that they didn't originally aim to do so, demographics just worked in their favour... At first. \n\nThe true goals of population readjustment didn't happen until years later. The settlement of Israel into a true nation-state brought with it all the questions that had been settled in other nations a century prior. Language, ethnicity, and religion were big parts of that. For example, the main language of the Jewish people in Europe and America was historically Yiddish, but many in Israel wished to return to Hebrew both due to history, the association of Yiddish with their time \"in exile\", and its close relation to German. Religion was also a big question and Israel was largely split between a desire to become a more modern secular state akin to Britain, France, or West Germany VS. a more conservative religiously-led state with Jews as the only desired population, laws based on the Torah and other religious texts, and even possible exclusions for spouses of immigrants who were not Jewish. This split was and has remained a major defining part of Israeli politics and I am sure you can guess which side came to dominate. Spoiler: It was the more conservative side.\n\nNow, in the defense of Israel and their government, their first years were ROUGH. Their declaration of independence (existence is a better term) was immediately met with an invasion by their Arab neighbours who saw this as an invasion of Arab land. Like all things, politics did play a majority role, but there were legitimate grievances.\n\nThe Palestinian argument was strongest at Israel's inception, at least with the benefit of hindsight. Israel was basically just another colonial nation akin to French Algeria or South Africa, where a white minority dominated, especially at the beginning. Both France and South Africa treated their native populations horribly in order to maintain their rule and many, both Palestinians and those sympathetic to them, saw this as Britain and America establishing a puppet nation in the region in order to expell Muslims like a new Crusade. The problem was that the Western World was mainly sympathetic to the Jewish plight following the Holocaust and the subsequent invasions of Israel only grew this feeling. For Israel, the only way to truly end these attempts was to fully break the strings connecting the land to the Palestinians, which began the big attempts to target the Palestinians.\n\nWhile I cannot say if the ensuing actions were influenced by the mass ethnic cleansings of Germans in Europe, there was definitely a similar mindset. Germans were expelled en masse from their territories in what is now Poland, Russia, and Czechoslovakia in order to destroy German claims to the regions, even in places where non-Germans made up only a miniscule percentage. As the Palestines had frequently aided in the wars against Israel, seeing it as their own war of independence, they were frequently targeted afterwards. Israel also used the wars to expand their land and it brought up another contributing factor that would contribute to Israeli politics: The \"We Were Here First\" argument.\n\nIn my personal opinion, this argument is almost always a pile of you-know-what. This argument is not unique to Israel, and postulates that the country which first owned a region is its main \"rightful\" ruler, often using historical sites and events to cite that a region only is developed because of X country. Zionists to this day will claim that all of the region's developments are owed to historical Israel and that the development of the Jews there makes it their home more rightfully than the people who settled it since then. Similar arguments are made in Poland regarding the so-called \"Recovered Territories\" (despite many of them only being very briefly Polish, almost or more than a Millennium ago) as well as by Russia in Ukraine. I personally find this argument deeply problematic because it will never end. France and the British Isles used to be Celtic but no one would buy Ireland claiming them, just like Germany trying to regain its lands in Poland would be as unfair to the Poles living there now as it was to the Germans living there a century ago.\n\nLastly, and tied into the previous notion, is the Victim Complex, i.e. Nations which suffer under something and proceed to use this suffering as a blanket excuse. Germany was humiliated by the Entente in WW1 and brought forth a dictator who made that war look like a skirmish. Poland after WW1 was finally free from Russian and German domination and proceeded to oppress the non-Polish citizens in its new lands just like was done to them. North Korea went from Japanese rule to one of the worst dictatorships in the world which made the Japanese look nice by comparison. And they all used previous suffering as a blanket excuse.\n\nIsrael came to see their future as relying on the primacy of their own culture and religion, one which had been suppressed and persecuted long before the Nazis and now had a chance to flourish. They were not the first to take this too far, and are neither wholly guilty nor wholly innocent.\n\nMy personal opinion? I feel that the creation of Israel was a poor solution to Jewish persecution, one which only further infringed on the rights of innocent Peoples, BUT neither do I think that \"unmaking\" Israel is a viable solution either. Too many people have made families and lives there, and the bad blood runs deep between both regions. With the way that the scales of power tip, I'm afraid that it doesn't look good for the Palestinian people, and even if Israel undergoes radical chance (and many young people from there are rejecting the old values) it might be too late.",

In particular 2 emperors, vespasian and Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple within it. Caliphs did nothing to displace Jews because Jews were people of the book, dhimmi, protected by the Islamic law and without a political entity representing them. Christians called the Jews deicides because they choose Barabbas over Jesus. That's the reason why they were persecuted but in the middle age (excluding Richard I who expelled Jews from England not to patly back the loans Jews have granted him for the crusade) things weren't\"that bad\". Things went south during the Renaissance when, in particular in Spain after the end of the reconquista, all the Jews were expelled moving then to Venice or Greece (Thessaloniki in particular where there was a thriving Jewish community until WWII). Also protestant Germany wasn't an easy place to live for a XVI-XVII century jew.",

Not overt, or at least not condoned, but not condemned either.\n\nWe had Jews at our schools and we were good friends the entire time. Even my Jewish friends would make jokes about other Jews in a \u201clighthearted\u201d manner but looking back it was just an adaptation to fit in and it makes me sick looking back on it.\n\nHonestly, I currently don\u2019t hear any anti-semitism in California where I live and I think that\u2019s because a lot of people who didn\u2019t grow up in our area moved here from the south/Midwest to escape that kind of thinking.\n\nHowever, I haven\u2019t asked my kids if they have experienced any discrimination but on the other hand they are very open if \u201csomeone is being mean to them\u201d and we all talk it out.\n\nTLDR: people are shitty everywhere, I haven\u2019t experienced it with my Jewish kids or wife (I know that means it hasn\u2019t actually happened) but I was raised in a culture of minor anti-semitism as a Catholic because \u201cJews killed Jesus.\u201d \n\nBonus thought: Why do Jews get hated on for \u201ckilling\u201d Jesus but the Romans get a pass and the \u201cRoman Catholic Church\u201d gets named after the actual executioners of Jesus???",

The roman catholic church is named as such because it's pope resides in Rome, whilst the Orthodox patriarch resided in the Eastern Roman capital of Constantinople, and the egyptian coptic patriarch resided in roman Alexandria, etc.",

The effect was they had a word they could use against every group they didn't like without getting too specific. The phrase gave a permission structure for political violence. \"Wokeism\"  is the same thing. People laugh that \"woke\" doesn't mean anything and the GOP can't define it, but it's not supposed to mean anything. It's an easy, convenient slur to use on anyone they hate. The flexibility is the whole point. It's a very simple linguistic conduit for hatred.",

That's not to say that they never misinterpret the evidence left or that missing artifacts lead to incorrect conclusions. And everyone has some biases. But if I had to choose between random Nazi from Trinidad and the concensus of Historians with documented evidence, I'm going with the latter.",

In this case trying to convince people that Hitler liked black people is truly ridicoulous and funny, he was all about germanic supremacy, he only considered equals those countries that had inhabitants of germanic origin.\n\n So in the case of this Trinitarian man, it is impossible to even consider his argument as true. And yes, I agree that history is full of lies, even ancient history, didn't the romans erased almost all evidence of Carthage and their culture after they defeated them?",

The cult of tradition. \u201cOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.\u201d\n2. &amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rejection of modernism. \u201cThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.\u201d 3.\n\nThe cult of action for action\u2019s sake. \u201cAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.\u201d\n\n4. Disagreement is treason. \u201cThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.\u201d 5.\n\nFear of difference. \u201cThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.\u201d 6.\n\nAppeal to social frustration. \u201cOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.\u201d 7.\n\nThe obsession with a plot. \u201cThus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.\u201d\n\nThe enemy is both strong and weak. \u201cBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.\u201d 8.\n\nPacifism is trafficking with the enemy. \u201cFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.\u201d 9.\n\nContempt for the weak. \u201cElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.\u201d 10.\n\nEverybody is educated to become a hero. \u201cIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.\u201d 11.\n\nMachismo and weaponry. \u201cMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.\u201d 12.\n\nSelective populism. \u201cThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\u201d 13.\n\nUr-Fascism speaks Newspeak. \u201cAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.\u201d\n\nI also missed one somewhere since copy paste didnt work well.\n\nSome of this might not make sense but he goes into depth for each one.\n\nBut tl;dr a bunch of reactionary people who will literally blame anything like immigrants, gays, jews (which today are called marxists, globalists) as something that'll ruin the old fashioned way of living despite the fact that the world is always changing in literally every decade and century. They want a hierarchy where men are at the top and they're the rutheless warriors and anyone who says or thinks otherwise is an enemy.\n\nedit: I pressed save edit and despite that, reddit completely ruined the numbering points. I give up on this site, good to see so many black outs occurring tomorrow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: since this is being upvoted, here's the original that I copied from\n\n[https://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html](https://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html) \n\njust keep in mind that's a summary.

                            "comment": "14 Traits of Fascism by Umberto Eco\n\nPowerful and Continuing Nationalism\n\nFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\nDisdain for the Recognition of Human Rights\n\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \u201cneed.\u201d The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, and long incarcerations of prisoners.\n\nIdentification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause\n\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists\u2026\n\nSupremacy of the Military\n\nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\nRampant Sexism\n\nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation.\n\nControlled Mass Media\n\nSometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation or by sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Government censorship and secrecy, especially in war time, are very common.\n\nObsession with National Security\n\nFear of hostile foreign powers is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\nReligion and Government are Intertwined\n\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government\u2019s policies or actions.\n\nProtection of Corporate Power\n\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\nSuppression of Labor Power \n\nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\nDisdain for Intellectuals and the Arts\n\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\nObsession with Crime and Punishment\n\nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\nRampant Cronyism and Corruption\n\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\nFraudulent Elections\n\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",

Talking about the holocaust is a way for them to simultaneously associate themselves with Nazi violence, while denying it allows them to disassociate from responsibility for wrongdoing and accuse Jews and other \"enemies\" as liars. The book The Racist Mind by Raphael Ezekiel explores this paradoxical and hypocritical phenomen.",

There are in fact people out there who want the total eradication of the Jews... and most of them aren't even Nazis.\n\nThe other thing is that modern group identities rarely ever lend themselves to homogenous opinions.  If you ask environmentalists what power sources they'd approve of they range from everything but coal to only solar.  What ties these people together is a common desire.\n\nNeo-Nazis are not harmless, but they're more like a social club than a group ideology.  Younger people who get into these groups just want acceptance and when they start getting radicalized it's by accepting a stronger and stronger more extreme opinion on the world.\n\nMost modern Nazi groups are less about the eradication of the Jews and more about the preservation of the \"white race.\"  Sometimes it's strictly German and sometimes it's more broadly accepting of Eastern Europeans and other European countries.  When you have Nazis and politics they're looking at discriminatory social networks and punishments.  When you're looking at Nazis as a civil society group they're more about preventing the mixing of races in neighborhoods and preventing non-white use of public infrastructure.  For example the Sons of Odin was a \"neighborhood watch\" group that patrolled neighborhoods in order to harass minorities.\n\nBut as I said, these groups aren't exactly super consistent.  As you dig down the rabbit hole you'll find a conveyance of morals based on how far down that rabbit hole you intend to go.",

When hitlers nazis rose to power it wasn\u2019t because of promises to eradicate the Jews and start a world war. \n\nIt was about restoring Germany to her former glory, bringing jobs to ease the failing economy, and many liked him because of how un-politician like he seemed. \n\nAnd for the first few years of his leadership, things went very well for the average German. His introduced conscription policy, revamping the military, and major public works programs were hugely popular. They heavily reduced unemployed and got the German economy under control. \n\nThere were warning signs, such as Jewish people being forced to wear marks to ID them, Jewish businesses being boycotted, and other laws designed to restrict people hitler deemed \u201cundesirable\u201d. These went largely ignored by the world, and in 1938 he even won the man of the year award from life magazine. He hosted the Olympics as well in 1936. At the time he was viewed as the bright future of Germany. \n\nPoint being, the dangerous ones will promise many things that will appeal to the majority of the population. A better economy, lower prices for essential goods and services, debt relief, ect. They may blame marginalized groups for why the economy is bad or why prices are so high. Today, it seems like many of them are targeting LGBTQ+ people. I hope that they never succeed, but with the current political climate (at least in the US) it\u2019s looking like that may happen in certain states which is a horrifying prospect.",

When someone tells you who they are believe them the first time.\n\nAnd if you for even a moment think it couldn\u2019t happen here, crack open a history book odds are it already happened here.

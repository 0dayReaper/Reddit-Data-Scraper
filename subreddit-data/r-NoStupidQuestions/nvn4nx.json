    "postText": "I\u2019m 21 years old and I am a terminal cancer patient. I was doing well for awhile but it appears my borrowed time is up. I have Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in my lungs and I was wondering if anyone here could help me understand what\u2019s going to happen as this starts to progress further. I want to know what I\u2019m in for. I\u2019m not looking for a sugar coated \u201ceverything\u2019s fine\u201d approach. I know I\u2019m dying, I just want to know what\u2019s coming before the end.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not looking for the moment of death or afterlife. I\u2019m asking about the physical decline I\u2019m in for.\n\nEdit 2: to anyone that reads this thank you very much for your comments. I got many great answers to my question and many of you shared personal experiences. I can\u2019t thank you all enough.\n\nEdit 3: please stop telling me to turn to religion. Simple as that\n\nEdit 4: With an extremely heavy heart I\u2019m sorry to say that OP lost his battle with cancer today. OP was blown away by all the support and advice he received from this thread. He definitely appreciated all the advice.",

You won't have to worry too much, eating nothing and drinking nothing will lead to less waste when that does (if it does.)\n\nSome people report an overwhelming sense of peace before the end. I hope this is true for you. I hope you have a safe passage and wonderful journey.",

Go out euphoric, comatose, and most importantly, without extreme pain. There's no such thing as \"dying with grace.\" Don't hold yourself to that standard. No one else in the history of death has managed it, so don't  expect it of yourself. Peace bud.",

You may even have weeks left, but they will not be fun and you will lose weight and get weaker. Ask for opiates/morphine. They will keep you on it until the end. It will take any physical discomfort away and you will actually experience euphoria. They will increase the dose as the days go in, you may have strange dreams, but overall you will feel emotionally fine and relaxed and sleep a lot. It is not an unpleasant way to die. There will be no pain once they get you on the drip. Just increasing tiredness, lots of sleep, until one day your heart stops beating while you're asleep. There will be no sudden shock. You won't even know it is about to happen. You'll be dreaming some weird, crazy, fun opium dream. Then just peace, forever. I recently watched my sister pass this way from stage 4 cancer. Before she got to the end stages she was very depressed and anxious. Once she got to the last few weeks it all changed and she just wanted to rest, and she stopped worrying. Passing with morphine/opiates is a gift. Many of us will die suddenly or painfully, a relaxed and restful, calm, dreamy death is something I hope I have when my time comes. You are very brave, and I know this feels unfair. Just know that you're not alone. We are thinking of you, and we are all going to die. I only hope I go with as much dignity as you are. I will be there holding your hand in my mind as you lie there. Death itself will feel exactly like before you were born. Before you were born, you weren't upset about it. Death itself feels just like before you were born.",

Spend time writing and recording messages to everyone important in your life so they have something to remember you when you're gone.\n \nA small spray bottle filled with water and another with your favourite non water beverage and it will help your family wet your mouth and give you some comfort when you no longer have the strength to drink through a straw.  \n\nMove while you can.  At some point, you won't be able to.  \n\nFind comfort in religion if you want.  There are Chaplins at hospital that will simply sit and talk with you, and try and keep you company.  They won't try to convert you, but will offer it if you ask.  \n\nAt some point, you will be pissing in a bottle and using a bed pan... get used to it.  Don't be self conscious about the nurses helping you, they do it every day and it's nothing to them.  \n\nFor what it's worth, I hope you do get the opportunity to go relatively pain-free.  I watched the pain steal my father from me until he wasnt anyone I recognised.\n\nSafe journey to whatever is on the other side",

Please don't be afraid. \n\nAs for the rest, u/marly-'s description was recognizable. This is what happened to my aunt two years ago (she had brain cancer). In the last weeks, she stopped eating and drinking, but she got an intravenous drip to get some liquid into her. She would lie in bed all day, but we could visit her. After a while, the visits were too exhausting and she would sleep most of the day. She was not afraid though. She was in fact very peaceful.\n\nWhat I heard, is that near the end most people get one last moment in which they feel suddenly much better. This was also the case for my aunt. On her last day on earth, she ate quite a lot of M&amp;Ms (she hadn't eaten in weeks by then so this was really surprising for me).\n\nThis is all I can tell you, I'm afraid. I'm so sorry that you got this disease, and at such a young age.",

We bought so many boxes of bottles of Ensure. She didn't end up drinking all of it and i guess you get sick of artifical strawberry, vanilla and chocolate after a while. When she'd crave some real food you know darn well my mom or my aunt or uncle would cook it for her. But she'd have 1 or 2 bites and then she won't be hungry anymore.\n\nI was there at the hospital when she passed. It was hard because she was in a lot of pain and it wasn't peaceful. She was howling in pain not comfortable and then the nurses made us go outside just so they can put the catheter in as they realised she hasn't passed waste in a while and her stomach was bloated. When we came back in she wasn't in pain anymore but we saw her just slow her breathing, then Her BP just going down (in the end the nurses muted the machine because when it got super low it made loud beeps). She looked back and forth at my aunt and uncle and you can tell she was saying her goodbyes by the way she looked. \n\nOP I don't know your plans but if I was in this situation I'd want to be sedated so that I just pass. Her death still haunts me 2 years later and I still see it so vividly. How she was in so much pain. How everyone was in pain because she was in pain and there was nothing for us to do anything about it. And how cold she was at 11pm when we finally decided to go home and I kissed her forehead. The next time I saw her was in her casket. I have her watch and her cheap 2 dollar velcro wallet and one of her jackets that she wore often. One sister got her handkerchiefs and the others got other items of clothing as remembrance.",

Most of the time, you won't feel too bad. Given your medication is managed well, you shouldn't be in too much pain. \n\nMost of the patients spend their last weeks very mindful. They took their time to sort out their personal affairs, said goodbye to loved ones. \n\nThey also like to be as independently as possible, taking their time to do as much as possible themselves. \n\nFrom my experience their view towards the world shifts, they gain a whole new perspective, on a spiritual and emotional level. They live their lives until the end and make it count. Most of the patients have been extraordinarily kind and caring. \n\nOn a physical level there is if course the constant decline in abilities. You'll have to accept that at some point you'll be bed bound and rely on other people's help. \n\nThere will be issues like constipation or soreness in your mouth, fatigue. You'll spend a lot of your time sleeping and little tasks will be very exhausting for you. You won't have much appetite.\n\nWhen it comes to dying itself, you won't have to worry. Your body knows what to do. It is a process that can take days, you'll just be asleep for a long time, you don't want to eat or drink anymore, you don't want to have a lot of interaction with other people anymore. \n\nSome people get very anxious, but as for the pain, there are meds that can ease that anxiety and help you relax. A palliative nurse will notice your anxiety even if you aren't able to tell her anymore, as you can tell from the body movements, and give you medication to help you. \n\nBefore you actually die, you won't be in a conscious state anymore. It will feel more like a deep sleep. You won't be awake and telling people goodbye, as in the movies. \n\nI am very sorry for what you are facing. \nI know you don't want anything sugar coated, I just tell you the truth as I know it. \n\nIt won't be that bad for yourself, you will be able to manage. And in the end you have no more strength left and you will just accept and even welcome the fact that it's now over. It's going to be bad for your loved ones, but that's why you will say goodbye to them in the weeks to come.",

You'll also gain a different perspective of life, that will make it easier for you to accept that. \n\nThat being said, good palliative care seeks to maintain as much quality of life as possible, supporting your decisions and trying to maintain independence as long as possible. \n\nYou might also notice a shift in what you personally perceive as 'quality of life', as you will become more mindful of everything and you might appreciate things that you haven't been aware of previously. \n\nNever hesitate to tell people what you want. Lots of people feel ashamed, or don't want to be a burden, or they want to protect loved ones. Doing things to improve your quality of life will not only help you, but also those around you, as they will be glad to do something that makes you feel more comfortable.",

The last 6 months she was very limited in her activities, pretty much just going from her bed to her chair, watching tv, eating a few small meals, then back to bed early in the evening. About 2 weeks before her death she wanted to go see a house my sister was buying. We all drove over and she walked around the whole house then ate a big burger for dinner. We were kind of amazed. Then 2 weeks later we noticed she had no urine in her bag and we normally emptied it at least twice each day. So we all knew the end was near. We were able to be with her until the end. She did have to get up and use the portable toilet during her last night and she missed. So she said \"Ohshit, I pooped on the floor!\" We all hoped those would not be her last words and they weren't. About 10am she woke up slightly and asked my sister what day it was. She told her the date and mentioned it was my nieces birthday. Mom opened her eyes and said \"Life goes on.\" She closed her eyes and died about an hour later.",

As your body weakens, you'll likely lose consciousness first. At this point, the doctors will be able to see you slipping as your vital signs weaken. It's possible that you'll pass very quickly after you lose consciousness. If it looks like it's going to take a while, the doctors will administer painkillers and tranquilizers. The painkillers will help make sure you aren't in pain, and the tranquilizers will help you to go peacefully, hopefully avoiding seizures as your nervous system shuts down.\n\nOnce you lose consciousness, it's unlikely that you'll be aware of the world around you. You might dream, you might not. The important thing is that you shouldn't feel any pain, and with the doctor's aid you should be able to just peacefully slip away.\n\nOne final note, when people are very near death, they often seem to know its coming. And from what I've gathered from my family members in the medical field, it will be easiest not to fight it when the time comes, just let it take you. \n\nYou seem to be facing this bravely, which is very admirable.

Bleeding out, knowing I was dying was arguably the most peaceful \u201cexperience\u201d I\u2019ve ever had. As I lost more and more blood I progressively moved into a more tranquil state. I looked at it as just a dream, and I presume bleeding out in real life is very different, but everyone here says moments before you go is entirely peaceful. Makes sense as an evolutionary adaption to me. Or, if God made us, it would make sense that we\u2019d experience our fight or flight state, but as soon as our body recognizes there\u2019s no hope, it would only be fair that our final moments are of utter tranquility.",

It was peaceful really, nothing out of the ordinary. The lack of existence (I guess) was comforting and calm.

I guess being alive is just inherently stressful, everything has to keep moving on a biological level. \n\nThinking about ceasing to exist for too long makes my brain feel claustrophobic and terrified. It\u2019s interesting that when it\u2019s inevitable, it becomes calming instead. Makes me irrationally hope that there is some other awareness/existence that happens after death, but it\u2019s just so alien and different from being alive, that we could never fathom it.

While waiting for them to arrive, my uncle decided he should close his husband's eyes like they do in movies. He put his fingers on the eyelids and pulled down but they didn't budge. Instead, his fingers slid down and left very clear fingerprints on each eyeball. He was so freaked out that they would think he had been poking at his husband's eyes that he frantically threw a pair of sunglasses on him so they wouldn't notice when they collected him. Later he realized that it probably seemed weirder that it looked like his husband died inside wearing sunglasses.",

Whitewater kayaking with the wrong gear in icy water when you're not a strong swimmer will do that.\n\nDeath itself, I can't tell you, as I survived to type this. However, if it's at all helpful, I wasn't afraid. I was a bit frustrated at being dragged along the bottom of the river unable to get to the surface, but not long after, the little bit of panic subsided &amp; I became quite calm. I briefly worried for my children, then remembered I have a lot of life insurance &amp; the rest of the family would see to their well being. My life didn't flash before my eyes, per se, but the thoughts I did have were rapid fire.\n\nI accepted my fate, relaxed, &amp; let go. I was running out of oxygen. I closed my eyes &amp; could feel my life starting to fade. For the first time in many years, I was at peace.\n\nThen the current shifted, shot me back to the surface, &amp; once I was getting air again, my survival instinct kicked back in. But before that, I was at peace. It felt like allowing myself to fall asleep, more than anything. The lead up when I knew I was in danger but thought I could survive was scary as hell. When I was certain I wouldn't, it was relaxing &amp; peaceful. No doubt, that was the result of oxygen deprivation. Given it's your lungs that are failing you, you'll likely experience similar oxygen deprivation, then you'll just drift away.\n\nDeath is terrifying for everyone, I'm sure, but nearly losing my life due to a lack of oxygen was painless &amp; oddly comfortable. I can only hope that when your time comes, you feel the same comfort I felt when you realize it's over.\n\nI wish I could say more, or something better. But nobody truly knows what death is like. Even those of us who've knocked on death's door probably don't really know. But, of all the ways my life has nearly ended (I've had many close calls), that was perhaps the best way to go.\n\nI hope that helps give you some kind of comfort or acceptance. Given I don't have a psych degree, I'm not sure what else I can do for you, but I hope this gives you something.\n\nEdit: This got far more attention than I intended. I may not be able to answer everyone's questions, as this was never meant to be about me. It was the only way I knew of to help OP understand what may be coming. I hope some others with similar yet different experiences can share to give OP some peace of mind. I doubt any of us can make the terminal nature of OP's illness better for them, but hopefully we can bring some kind of comfort to them.",

My last moments before the drugs felt exactly like described, I had the same thoughts about my kids and my life insurance.\n\nThen there was a separate occasion when I had that overwhelming sense of peace.  It was after my first colonoscopy, but since it happened as I was waking up I can't be certain it wasn't the drugs.  I tell you, having never touched an illicit drug that isn't green and leafy, I suddenly realised how people could become addicted to stuff.  I wonder if anyone that's done a variety of drugs and has had a near death experience would describe them as similar?",

From what I have gathered in my couple years of learning about DMT prior to trying it the first time, DMT is something naturally created in the pineal gland in your brain and your body releases it the moment you die. When I smoked it, I immediately thought I was dying. It was very overwhelming, but it was also beautiful and peaceful. \n\nGoing in, I knew DMT was a safe drug (for the most part) and that I would be okay, but it was so convincing that I was on a journey towards death. While tripping, I thought about my wife and kids and that I may never see them again, but a big part of me was okay with dying because I knew they would be okay. I don't have a personal near-death experience to compare it to, but after reading reports from people who were on the cusp of death, it sounds almost identical. Minus the trippy visuals, noises, and alien entities I assume.\n\nEdit: also, let me clarify. When I say DMT is a safe drug, I mean that it's not really something you can overdose on, or get addicted to. I could feel my heart beating super hard (maybe adrenaline) so I would not recommend DMT for anyone with heart complications.",

My guess is that they gave her some morphine and maybe a little ativan to help her relax and then she was able to go peacefully.

She hadn't received any treatment and wasn't in a hospital when it happened, so no morphine or anything to help with the pain. It was stage 4 breast cancer that had moved into her lymph nodes, spine, and lungs. At the beginning of the night, she was speaking and making jokes, albeit slowly and with labored breath, but as the night progressed, she started to deteriorate quickly. She wanted a bath, and her friend brought her to the tub. She was vomiting and in a lot of pain, but then her mind took over. She told me that she was inside a rose, and it was soft and lovely. A peach rose. The hallucination made her feel better and I imagine helped with the pain. We got her back into bed, and she came back to us for a little bit, but then the oxygen deprivation won. She started gasping for air and making these sounds I can't properly describe. By that time, the ambulance had arrived, she was taken to the hospital, where she was only kept alive by them manually pumping her lungs. So we let her go. \n\nI'm sorry I don't have the most comforting story for you, and I'm sorry if this doesn't actually answer your question. And I truly hope you'll be more comfortable than she was.",

The most common thing I have heard is as your brain starts to shut down you see flashes of a bright light. Some people say they see their life flash before their eyes. They see all the good times they had.   Several people have said they saw loved ones that have died standing there waiting for them.  I'm sorry that you are going through this. It's not fair at all. All I can say is make the time you have left the best days ever. Maybe try things that you were too afraid to try. I know I would go sky diving or maybe try magic mushrooms or acid just to get the experience.  \n\nPeople who fear death aren't really afraid of the dying part it's the fear of the unknown. We all have to go through it. I like to think that my loved ones who have died will be there with me. My dad and I like paranormal things like ghost. We promised each other that one dies before the other the one that does will do everything they can to let the other know if the afterlife is real.   We will have to see what happen.  I hope you get to create some new amazing memories with your family and I hope you get to do everything on your bucket list.",

            "comment": "I don't know if this will help or not. I copied this from a Hospice site. Dying is different for everyone, just like sickness is different from everyone. Nobody really knows what dying feels like because the person is shutting down and can't really describe what they are feeling. Pain can be helped with pain medication to keep a person comfortable. I think the final days/hours a person falls into a coma because their brain and organs are shutting down and you drift away in your sleep. \n\nThe following describes the physical symptoms people have observed a dying person to have. Here are end-of-life signs and helpful tips:\r  \n\r  \n**Coolness**. Hands, arms, feet, and legs may be increasingly cool to the touch. The color of the skin may change and become mottled.\n\n\r  \n**Confusion**. The patient may not know time or place and may not be able to identify people around them. \n\n\r  \n**Sleeping.** An increasing amount of time may be spent sleeping. The person may become unresponsive, uncommunicative, and difficult to arouse. How you can help: Sleeping more frequently is normal. You can sit quietly with them. Speak in a normal voice. Hold their hand. Assume they can hear everything you say. They probably can.\r  \nIncontinence. They may lose control of urinary/bowel functions. This is a common end-of-life change that can occur during the process of passing on. \n\n\r  \n**Restlessness**. The person may make repetitive motions such as pulling at the bed linen or clothing. This is due in part to A decrease in oxygen. \n\n\r  \n**Congestion.** There may be gurgling sounds inside the chest. This is also sometimes referred to as a \"Death Rattle.\" These may be loud. This end-of-life symptom does not indicate the onset of severe pain.\n\n\r  \n**Urine decrease**. Output may decrease and become tea colored. \n\n\r  \n**Fluid and food decrease.** Your loved one may want little or no food or fluid. The body will naturally conserve energy required for the task ahead. Food is no longer needed. \n\n\r  \n**Change in breathing.** The person may take shallow breaths with periods of no breathing for a few seconds to a minute. They may experience periods of rapid, shallow panting. These patterns are common and indicate decrease in circulation.\n\n\r  \n**Fever.** Increase in temperature is common.",

            "comment": "I am a junior doctor working in palliative care, and I have seen more people die in the last few months than I probably would in my entire career. Ultimately, palliative care is all about providing patients with a 'good death' and it means different things for different people. Most patients with us have metastatic cancers. Less common would be end stage COPD and strokes. It's best to speak to your oncologist but hopefully I can help.\n\nDeath is both different and similar for everybody. I'll explain. We often talk about the Karnofsky  and the PACA scores for each patient on the ward round. Both of these tend to indicate what the general condition is. The Karnofsky in particular can give you an idea of how the body declines physically. Below are the links:\n\nhttps://www.mdcalc.com/karnofsky-performance-status-scale\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.nwcscnsenate.nhs.uk/files/2714/3394/6192/Fatigue.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOqo3n6onxAhUM4OAKHYnhDvsQFjAEegQIGRAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw2isXlXKJGTlB48B40Lqghc&amp;cshid=1623217323883\n\n\nPatient's symptoms differ depending on their cancer and where it has spread. If it is in the bones, you tend to get bone pain. Each type of pain has different characteristics and it is difficult to describe. However, if the bone is 'weak' you can get pathological fractures which can cause spikes in pain as you can imagine. If the tumor/swelling from the cancer/bone impinge on nerves, you may get sensation changes +/- weakness +/- neuropathic pain.\n\nHowever, these can be managed with medications which reduce swelling, strengthen bones, and proper analgesia. The silver lining is that as your body deteriorations, you will feel less and less of these symptoms. All patients, who are slowly deteriorating, reach a point where all active treatment is stopped and focus is put on anticipatory medications. These are the ones that keep a person comfortable in the terminal stages, and tend to deal with pain, anxiety, seizures, secretions, nausea, vomiting, mouth care, etc. They work very well! \n\nThe terminal phase of the deterioration or dying, is where things tend to be similar. If the symptoms are well managed, people become weaker and weaker. They will sleep more and more through the day, sometimes the whole of 24hrs. They will likely lose all appetite, and stop eating and drinking. They will likely become unconscious. Their breathing becomes erratic and noisy, which may be distressing to people around you but the person is usually not registering it by that point. But usually, these are not uncomfortable for the patient, and tend to pass away very peacefully. This is a very much a summarised version of what happens.\n\nDeath, if well managed, is a very peaceful process.\n\nWhat you should focus on now is making plans. Whenever we clerk our patients in, we discuss with them about their medical bits, but also about their spirituality, religion, family dynamics, preferred place of care and death (home, hospice, etc), who is important to them, who we should keep in the loop, organ donation, genetic sampling, and what their goals and expectations are, among other things. \n\nIf you'd like, these can all be worked into an \"Emergency health care plan (EHCP)\" or an \"Advanced directive\". You can also think about \"Lasting power of attorney\" (appointing someone who can legally make decisions on your behalf). A \"DNAR (do not attempt resus)\" is also important, this one is put in place by a doctor, hopefully, after a discussion with you. \n\nThis is probably too much information to take in right now. Sorry. \n\nSpend some quality time with the people you care about. I am really sorry about what you're going through, and I wish you all the best.\n\nFeel free to ask anything.",

The pain I should have felt in my lungs slowed down. Felt frustration, but just sorta gave up. While this was done in 5 minutes or less before waking up (wasn't passed out, but sorta... came to) on the side of the pool like nothing happened.   \n\n\nMy grandmother. Her systems just... shut down (old age). For about two weeks she was just... laying in her bed. No IV's, or anything, but not really eating or moving. Slowly speaking. Dazed. She did not seem to be in pain, but sorta... half asleep and awake all the time. She passed while I was in the room and I didn't even really know until the machines told me. Although she wasn't senile, her last days seemed like she didn't want to wake from a really intense nap. \n\nMy friend Ashley (not her real name). Cancer at 23. Dead at 25. She was... unrecognizable. Swollen, changed. All the IV's and machines hooked up. She was comatose for months. The hospital made no secret of the fact that they were keeping her alive to study the final stages of her specific cancer. She was unresponsive, but her family decided to keep her alive (barely) so progress could be made in research. Nobody knows what she felt during this time. CAT scans and brain function suggested she felt nothing and was functionally dead before her body gave out weeks later. But we don't know. When she was conscious and talking she would not speak of pain, just fatigue and frustration and confusion. The decision to allow herself to be kept 'alive' after hope was going was partially hers.   \n\n\nMake your wishes known.. ahead of time. If you are confused or frustrated and strange people are smiling at you, take it at face value, at people trying to help, people desperate to help and who care more than maybe you'll remember at the time.",

He had a rare muscular wasting disease and became weaker as time progressed. His mind was fine, but he was trapped in his body. \n\nHe was tired and dosed a great deal. I remember him telling me all of my life when I was tired. \"Gnat, you'll sleep when you're dead. Let's keep going.\" He did that until his wings arrived. When he woke up, he talked. If you have things to say, stay up. Docs will keep you comfortable.\n\nThe toughest part for him was being physically changed. He was a 30-yr USN veteran. This was not how he wanted to end.  I wiped him  clean for the last time. Be prepared to depend on people for your basic needs. \n\nAlso, voice how much of an intervention that you wish. We placed a PEG tube to help my dad  keep his nutrition up. I asked for this because I didn't realize that he wouldn't  come back from not being able to eat. I was sitting by his bed one day and in his sleep, he motioned as though he was picking up food and eating. Broke my heart. Be kind, voice your wishes.\n\nYou will be kept comfortable, but will get tired.  Do not be afraid to ask for what you need. This is all about you. Voice your needs. I kept a close watch on this. \n\nMuch love to you, little one. I'm sorry that your  journey will end much too soon.",

            "comment": "The answer to this question can largely depend on the kind of treatment you opt for - ICU and full code vs. palliation at home are entirely different things - different pain, levels of awareness, medications, interventions, yadda yadda. I hope there is a palliative team consulted for you already. If there isn\u2019t, please ask for one. Any doctor you see should be able to discuss death, but the palliative care folks often have more time to talk/experience with death, which translates to attentive and compassionate care. Never be afraid to ask for a second opinion. Ask lots of questions. Ask about intubation and resuscitation. You only die once. Do it the way you like. If you haven\u2019t yet, then whenever you are ready, ask your medical team to go through appropriate documentation with you in order to clarify your wishes. You are the driver, and everyone else is along for the ride. \nI cannot get in my patients\u2019 heads, but I will say that it can be very frustrating to see patients eternally left on the vent because their family is (understandably) experiencing guilt about discontinuing care, despite no hope of improvement. Sometimes less care is more, even though goodbyes may arrive rudely before we are prepared for them. Fortunately, we now have many helpful continuous medications to remove feelings of panic, and to ease you into a sleep. Dying in our era can be much kinder than in many eras preceding ours. I\u2019m so horribly sorry that your goodbyes are not coming on the schedule you expected, and I\u2019m sorry that is out of your control. I hope you find some comfort in the things that are still very much so in your control.\nEdit: specifically, opioids can assuage air hunger.",

Just unlucky I guess. Once, when I was a child, I was nearly drowned when an older kid decided to hold me underwater. When I was a young teen, I developed a severe lung infection and had to be kept on several antibiotics to stay stable. And most recently, I had my heart stop and restart before the age of 20. (A genetic arrhythmia previously unbeknownst to me, exacerbated by a medication I was already on).\n\nIn every situation, I was scared at first. When I thought I was going to die, I would fight and fight. But my energy would decrease. My heart would struggle to keep going. That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019d say is unusual when you know you are about to die- I was so keenly aware of my heart that I felt it everywhere in my body. I grew tired of fighting though. In every situation, I just kind of... gave up. I was done. My body was done. I didn\u2019t have the will to fight what was happening to me anymore, which made me unbearably sad for a few seconds. I was sad that I was giving up, and a little angry, but then I was at peace. I thought about everything in life that had made me happy. \nI thought about people I loved, and how lucky I was to meet them. I thought about my dog and my partner. I even thought about my coworkers. I decided I was ok with dying, and let go. From there on out, I just felt patient and tired. I had all the time in the world to wait to die, and it would happen when it happened. I closed my eyes and waited to go. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say to you. I have been dying, but never dead. And while my time is borrowed to a certain extent, my circumstances are not like yours. Physically, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get a lot of really smart and thoughtful responses on here. Emotionally, I can only tell you what I experienced. I went through the fearful, fighting stage, realized I was going to die; sadness and anger for a few seconds and then a peaceful release and patient wait for death. When I was closest to death, I mostly felt tired, patient, and calm. I was ready to go.\n\nI hope that we\u2019ve helped you get ready as best we can.",

It\u2019s kinda of like when your in a dream and trying to run and you just don\u2019t seem to move. I\u2019d imagine that is what it feels like to be dying. \n\nLosing autonomy and all that jazz is gonna suck. With your case your gonna feel stiffness and swelling in your lungs, across your chest etc. it\u2019s going to hurt to move, walk and even breathe. A lump near the surface of the skin is common, a fever that doesn\u2019t break and broken bones caused by tumours growing is part of the parcel that is Ewing\u2019s. \n\nBut all of this knowledge is just a stone throws away if you used google so I\u2019m guessing you must want something else. \n\nDeath is death. It\u2019s something that it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have or how much fame it will eventually come for you. People always think of death as some evil figure but I like to think that death is more of a deity which wants you to live and wants you to power through all that life throws at you because it knows that it is inevitable and you will meet it at the end of the story. \n\nMany people claim that when death catches up to you, one may see there god or something magical happens and there transported to another world to be it\u2019s hero and that might all be possible. It also might be possible nothing happens and it all fades to black. In both cases this is a good thing. The former means you move onto another form of life and living while the latter means an end to your suffering. Death is moving on from this plain of existence and I\u2019m not being religious or super scientific about it. It is really just moving on.\n\nEverything you\u2019re going through is daunting and reaching out to the people around you may seem harrowing but when your living day by day not knowing when the end is just make those final human connections to carry you into the next phase because that may be all you take with you. Try not to go into the light with any regrets weighing you down. Talk to friends and family and anyone that brings you happiness. The ones you leave behind will also feel affected by your passing. Let them remember someone inspiring that brings joy and meaning to there life. My grandfather always said he never wanted anyone to feel pity for him and I\u2019m sure you feel the same.\n\nStay strong. And if you do meet our maker tell him he or she or it owes me a lot.",

Slowly you lose definition in your sight and all you can see is light.  That light slowly becomes smaller until it's a just a spot. If you are scared you will feel your heart pounding. You can still think clearly.  Try to calm yourself,  talk to yourself.  The calmer you are the better you will feel and the easier it will be to think. When you are calm everything will be ok.",

It\u2019s really shitty that it\u2019s happening so young for you, but think of life in more than your human terms. Time is relevant. Dogs get 10 years, some bugs get 24 hours. It\u2019s not the time, it\u2019s what you did with it. Death is also as natural to your existence as birth, it\u2019s the path paved by every person, plant or animal that has ever existed. \n\nAs for the actual process, well, I have watched a few people die. My father had brain cancer and he went into a coma a few days before he passed. This is common for cancer patients, and you will be well medicated. Just before he passed, he opened his eyes and despite his family being in the room, he looked to an empty corner, smiled and took a final breath. I don\u2019t know what that means, we speculated that it may have been someone we lost earlier to show him the way. I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s a part of the reason I don\u2019t fear death. Whatever it was, he was happy to see it. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry again that this is happening to you. From the bottom of my heart and soul, FUCK cancer.",

I've only worked in an emergency department, but I can assure you, I've never in my close to 20 years seen someone come to and be panicked about what was happening.  Confusion at times yea, but not panick and distress.  There can be panick prior to a crash, but it's typically short term, and seeing you are already under medical care I can't see you getting to this kind of situation.  I personally feel you are not in a situation in which you will suffer.",

These hospice doctors have huge amounts of compassion. I am an ER nurse and my favorite most compassionate doctor cut his teeth in hospice care. They can get you morphine to help ease feelings of air hunger, and other medications to help with the anxiety. I wish you a peaceful journey. Do you have any advice to convey for those of us blessed with time?",

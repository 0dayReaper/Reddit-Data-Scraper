    "postText": "Hey y'all, I work in the Air Force (got propoganda'd when I was a kid) and I've recently taken up writing. I work in a place where I'm not allowed to have my phone on me, so the only computer available is my military computer. I heard from a coworker of mine that if I were to write (or just create anything copyrightable) then the military automatically owns that IP. Is this true?\n\nedit: had a /r/USDefaultism moment :/ i'm part of the USAF.\n\nedit 2: Seems like \"it depends, but probably not\" is the consensus here. Also, read your contract. Thanks for the help, y'all!",

The worst they can do is use it as evidence of dereliction of duty. Even then they can't claim *ownership* of it outside of limited circumstances.\n\nThere are like... maybe two cases in recorded history where the government actually sued to get money from the sale of a book, but it was after the author already published the book and the book contained certain information that hadn't gone through the necessary pre-approval channels.",

In many countries armed forces owned property and employees are subject to special military rules so it is possible that the material would indeed be owned by the military in that case. Depending on what kind of stuff you write your employer might want to keep control over your writings if it might affect them badly in particular, can\u2019t see why they would be interested in claiming copyright over a romance fiction story or the like though.",

The caveat here is that it has to be *for legal purposes* - i.e., for a criminal investigation. The security office can't just copy your movie script and sell it for money just because it's a real banger of a script. Even if they *did* have to seize it, for instance it contained classified material on an unclassified system, they couldn't monetize it at all.\n\nAll that being said, do be mindful about what you write about. And of course don't let it interfere with your regular work duties (I know, work gets slow so w/e).",

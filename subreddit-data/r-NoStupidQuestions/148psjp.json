I've seen 45 square meter two room and kitchen apartments go for like 1200 dollars, which in my country (Sweden) would go for like 500-550. \n\nIs this because landlords in the U.S are legally allowed to set whatever rent they want and can also raise the yearly rent however much they want? Here it's regulated and negotiated each year, and this year we got a really high rent increase where the average across the country is like 4.6% and people are panicking.",

They can't raise it in the middle of a year long lease, for example.  \n\nBut at the end of your contracted period, they can raise the rent however high they like in most states. \n\n\"Rent controlled\" units are few in number and have different rules for when/if the rent can be raised by any amount. \n\nI was paying $1500/m for one bedroom in a friend's mobile home.

            "comment": "It varies from place to place. As a general rule, landlords often have to jump through various hoops but assuming they do so they can effectively raise rent as much as they like.\n\nFor example, a landlord may be limited in how much they can increase rent upon renewal for an existing tenant, but not limited if they bring in a new tenant. In such cases landlords will often seek to evict or otherwise get rid of existing tenants in favor of bringing in new ones for whom they can jack up the rent. This is one of the reasons why leases these days are full of so many crazy rules and restrictions -- landlords often put those in there not necessarily because they care about whether tenants do something but rather because they *expect* tenants to break at least some rules...which gives them the ability to get rid of basically anyone basically any time they want.\n\nSo a theoretical limit on rent increases upon renewal is effectively bypassed by landlords who put insane rules in leases and then use those rules to evict or pressure to leave tenants if/when they think they can make more with new tenants.\n\nI've attended literal trainings on this topic, and on the market conditions where landlords prioritize long term tenants (when the market sucks) and when they prioritize evictions (when rents are rising rapidly). Landlords will literally put in specific payment order sequences so that, if a tenant pays less than their total balance, the payment gets applied to expenses that are non-evictable first, which maximizes the chances that the tenant doesn't pay some expense or fee that then allows the landlord to evict them if they want.\n\nWhether or not a landlord chooses to seek eviction for any particular tenant depends on a variety of factors, of course. But they *always* like to have the option, and so will try to give themselves that option as quickly and as often as possible.",

The US tends to allow more building than Europe though, though that varies from place to place, so that keeps prices in check. You know how Europeans always wonder about the US having \"paper walls\"? That's why, buildings just get slapped up in a hurry here.",

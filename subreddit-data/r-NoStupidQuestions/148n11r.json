    "postText": "When I was 18, I had to undergo surgery to remove a tumor I had in my brain (not the main point, I\u2019m still dealing with cancer but it\u2019s not as bad), and since then my drive to jerk off has completely vanished. I spent a couple of months in a hospital after the surgery, and after returning home I began noticing this lack of wanting to jerk off, despite an increase in my level of stress. \n\nIs this normal for someone my age?",

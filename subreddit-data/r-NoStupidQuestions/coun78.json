I went to visit her for the first time last year, and it was my first trip to the US since I was a kid.\n\nWe were at a Wal-Mart for groceries, and it was my first ever visit to one. She has just recently moved out, and her new place is lacking in some basic stuff. She suggested we pick up a microwave while we're at Wal-Mart because they sell them, and sells them for cheap. We actually walked around for a bit and yeah, they do sell everything.\n\nThe fact that I can just literally buy anything from kitchen appliances to groceries to camping gear at reasonable prices in one store blew my mind. Pretty sure I did say 'Welcome to America' to myself at one point from that.",

(I name them by the core demographic, but in reality *every* demographic is represented.)\n\nIn my old town the Poor walmart had the most basic stuff behind locks. The Rich walmart looked closer to a target.\n\nThe Latino Walmarts had a much better selection of food (closer to a supermercado) and Soccer replica jersies. Black walmart had a huge hair care section for all the different stuff black women (and men) do to their hair.\n\nSome had an electronics section that only had a single entrance (wasn't \"open\" flooring). Camping and hunting skews to what that local area has to hunt. If you're near water you have all the boating stuff as well.\n\nYou can tell pretty much anything you need to know about the socioeconomics and hobbies of locals just from a walmart tour.",

I live in the 'burbs, so our \"poor\" Walmart isn't on nearly the level of some of the ones you'll see, but the difference is still striking. \n\nMy son and I have recently fallen in love with fishing, so we're often out well before sunrise. We've been fishing super close to the house, where we sit right in between the \"poor\" Walmart  and a \"poor adjacent/rich\" one. The poor one has a LOT more fishing gear, but everything over about $20 is either locked up or has motion-activated cameras, like 4 per aisle. It also has every blade in the store under lock and key.\n\nThe \"poor adjacent/rich\" one looks like a rich one, but still has cameras, and while the kitchen knives are accessible, anything folding is locked up.\n\nThis morning, I decided to fish a different neighborhood a little farther away, and stopped at a third, more legitimately \"rich\" Walmart. Not only did they have lures that cost more than $5, but they also had a spinning display like you'd find for sunglasses full of folding outdoors knives with blades up to 6\" long, and no motion-activated cameras.",

Clothes are all redneck and much more cheap beer inventory. I once found a piece of paper in the toy department at my Walmart. It was explaining a process to the person deciding where stuff should be displayed, probably management level. It was chock full of sexist and demographic profiling, definitely not meant for public viewing. Granted it's toys, but I'm sure every department does the same. I took a picture of it because it was actually pretty interesting.",

One time when I was like 8 years old, I was at a drug store similar to CVS, and my grandfather was buying a few things including a bottle of whiskey.  I went to put it on the counter for him since I always just helped out and he was so elderly, and the woman at the counter literally freaked out on me and was like \"No no dear do not touch that!\" .  Literally she could not handle that an 8 year old was just helping to move a bottle of alcohol.   Like, ok I get it that you don't want a bunch of 20 year olds with a 21 year old buying booze and handling it.  But... a little 8 year old boy with his obviously very old grandfather?  Lady, do you really think I'm the one drinking this whiskey?   So stupid.\n\nEdit: and now all the idiots are out in force telling me its the law. Which its not.  Paste a link if its the law in indiana.  Also, are you saying that a baby couldnt also accidentally touch a bottle of alcohol?  That illegal too?  What about if i pushed the cart that technically had alcohol in it.  You people who want to argue over every little thing are do pathetic.",

The earlier days before the Marian reforms, post Marian reforms, and finally the late Empire. \n\nIn the early days of the republic, the army wasn\u2019t made up of your standard legionaries. Their armies were made up of mainly 3 types of soldiers. The histati, the principes and the triarii. Before going further, it\u2019s important to understand at this point in Rome, to be a soldier you needed to own property and land. These weren\u2019t the poorest people joining the army like we see later. The histati were the poorest and most inexperienced of the soldiers. They would be placed in the first line of the triple axes. The wealthier, more experienced, and better armored Principes would be the second line of soldiers. The triparri were the wealthiest and most experienced soldiers. They had the best armor, and used spears compared to the short swords of the histati and principes. They were placed in the rear as the last line and reserves. There\u2019s a Roman quote that goes along the lines of \u201cIt has come down to the triarii.\u201d They were the last line of defense of the other two waves failed. \n\nAfter hundreds of years and lots of war sucking away all the land owning men, they adjusted their recruiting system to allow the poorest of the poor to join, and the leader of the army/the state would pay for the arms and armor.  This would really take full swing during the time of Marius (the Marius in the Marian reforms) and Sulla. This is where you start to see the true legionaries armies, and those three types of soldiers start to fade away into just one type, since it\u2019s no longer based on your land and the armor you could afford. These are the soldiers we think about when we think Rome. This style of soldier would be around for a while, from 100bc-ish to about 250-300AD. These are the ones that would be wearing chain mail, and eventually, the famous over lapping metal band armor know as segmentata. \n\nEventually though, as inflation started taking full swing and more and more of their borders came under attack, they couldn\u2019t afford all the heavily armored and trained professional legionaries. This is when the Romans started to rely more on mercenaries and small garrisons of local people\u2019s. We see the short sword wielding, professional legionnaire, give way to spear wielding local garrisons. \n\nNow overall what made the Romans so great in war were 2 things: the discipline of the Roman army and their lack of willingness to give up. The Roman armies were typically better trained than their counterparts. The Romans would hold their ground, even when things looked rough, longer than their counterparts would. Even outnumbered the Romans would still stay in formation and do what their general said longer than their enemy (typically). \n\nWar was incredibly brutal, and battles sometimes only lasted a few minutes before one side would run. And that\u2019s when the majority of people would actually die, when one side would run and the calvary would chase them down. Roman soldiers didn\u2019t run as much as their counterparts.\n\nNow the other thing that made them so great in war was they just would not give up. 40,000 man army massacred by the enemy? Okay we\u2019ll send another. Happens again? Send another. Huge fleet destroyed in a storm? Build another. Happens again. Build another. The Romans would throw wave after wave of armies at you. Most nations at the time, if the army was defeated that was it. Most places couldn\u2019t simply muster another army after losing 40,000 men and their equipment. The Romans would do it 2-3 more times, and probably more, before having to surrender to someone.\n\nHope that kinda garbled run down helped a little bit. Feel free to get more specific and I can give you a more specific answer.",

It\u2019s long, but it\u2019s a good overall rundown of the entire history of the empire. It\u2019s a great starting point to look into more specific books that cover certain topics. Adrian Goldsworthy has a great series on the Roman military. The other option is *A Storm Before The Storm* by Mike Duncan. While he takes a little bit of artistic liberty, it\u2019s a light, very interesting and sometimes funny read about the turbulent politics that lead to the likes of Caesar and Pompey. Fantastic read for your first historical book about Rome in my opinion.",

While taking a long road trip for instance, it's almost a given that you'll have to visit a Walmart at some point. But some people actually seem to prefer Walmart, while others simply have no other option because it's the only store in their community to get certain things (or the only one they can afford to shop at, since they often work for Walmart and thus get paid Walmart wages).",

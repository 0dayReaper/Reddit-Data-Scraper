When you\u2019re on a swing set, the easiest way to perpetuate motion is to pull the swing back &amp; hop on! \n\n\nFrom any other perspective, forth &amp; back seems to make much more sense, though. \ud83e\udd23",

The first action is to move it 'back' first, release it, and it moves forward or 'forth' on its own.\n\nThe reality is that it's an idiomatic expression that doesn't always have any logic associated with it. People started saying it that way and it stuck.",

Not saying it is impossible or anything, just that if it is, I just don't see how. I have seen all the videos of those pickpockets taking watches off of peoples wrists and stuff and I just don't see how it could possible ever work on me. I tend to involuntarily react when I am touched and I am hyper aware of anyone near me to the point where it is exhausting. I would really like to see a pickpocket try to take my wallet from my back pocket, it simply does not compute with me how they would go about doing it without me noticing their hand on my ass. Again not saying impossible, just that if it is, they are doing something I am unable to comprehend by speculating alone. I would have to be shown how they do it, because I just don't understand how it would be possible in my case.",

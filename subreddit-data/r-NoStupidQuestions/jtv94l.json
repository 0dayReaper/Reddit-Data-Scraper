I heard a theory that it's because the fear is controlled, we know nothing bad won't happen to us when we sit and watch a movie, and we can pause or quit whenever. \n\nReally long series or unfinished series are really stressful tho! I hate when Netflix cancels a show in the middle after a couple season.",

By eliminating the chance that I potentially won\u2019t like something new, a good outcome was almost guaranteed, thus eliminating disappointment. That\u2019s probably why some people go back to the same vacation place year after year or don\u2019t order anything new from a menu.\n\nIt\u2019s all quite normal when you think about it",

In both cases the work doesn't cease to exist once the performance ends it just lives in the heads and hearts of the people who were there. Which was one of the main points of the series. They wanted a space where they didn't feel creatively inhibited by the weight of the permanence of YouTube so they could set out to just freely create something new every day. As a result the show was like live improv in that there was a lot of stuff that was just kinda stuff BUT there were golden moments (literally) that happened that stood out. If you want to know what the literal contents of the channel were then just hang around the places fans are sharing memories (or just ask them) and they'll all talk about those highlights. What it was ABOUT was creating a time and a place to share in something transient as a reminder to make the most of the time we have and to try to be fully present in appreciating the things that you are a part of as they are happening. The best way to properly understand that part of it is probably to grab some direction-less Unnus Annus fan and create a new moment in time with them.",

No matter what you do, you'll never get that story to move like it did before.\n\nI liken it to watching over the shoulder of a true-life painter as he puts a busy street on the canvas. What will he include and not include? Where will each new brushstroke take you? The wonderment that fills you as the blank canvas becomes filled with people and cars and trees and animals is the truest joy of reading.\n\nBut then you start to notice how little blank canvas is left - how few pages you have left to turn. And you are filled with an implacable dread, because you know it's almost over. The mystery is fleeing; it's coming to an end and all you can do is keep watching.\n\nAnd then it's over. He lets you keep the painting. You put it up in your bedroom with the rest and you know that at any point in the rest of your life, you can go back and look at it again, but it just won't be the same. Because you're not watching it in real-time anymore. The street you saw bustling with life is now dried on paper.\n\nThat post-book depression is the longing for the words on the pages to move for you like they did the first time you read them. When you didn't know what the next paragraph held and the world in which the characters found themselves was entirely without limit. Because any time you re-read the story, you know that they aren't free to roam anywhere like they were before. They are stuck in a cart on a track and all you can hope for is to notice something about the scene you didn't before, and to just try to relive those feelings you had the first time around.\n\nBut it will never be *quite* the same.\"",

They're not forever stilled; I just don't know what they're up to anymore.\n\nIf a story ends and the characters are still moving, still dynamic, if the plot doesn't reach a singular \"end state\", then we extrapolate them as still existing outside of our observation.\n\nIt's still a sad goodbye, because we won't see them again. But them being just \"gone\" is less painful than the sudden jarring fact that they never existed in the first place. Seeing them \"frozen\" forces us to acknowledge their fictional nature head-on. (And even nonfiction books lead to us creating our own personal \"incarnations\" of the characters)",

She is a fan of Markiplier, a guy from YouTube, who did a one-year project called Unnus Annus with his friend and fellow YouTuber, Ethan. Basically, the channel focused on how nothing is permanent, everything comes to an end. \n \nTonight, the show ended after an 11-hour marathon livestream looking back at everything they'd done for the year. Just a few minutes ago, the clock ran out and the project ended. By the time it ended, they'd deleted all of their other social media accounts, and when the clock reached zero, they deleted the channel. \n\nMy 11-year-old is on the couch crying because it's over. Like, legit crying huge tears. She loved the project, and even though she knows she can see them both on their other channels, the fact that the project is over deeply saddens her.",

The term is meant to describe the emptiness felt after you finish your favorite TV show or online series and have nothing else to watch.\n\n&gt;The feeling commonly arises after binge-watching a show on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. It's like getting to know a really good friend and then he leaves you forever. The emptiness can sometimes be too much to handle so it's important that you get hooked on another show pretty quickly.",

But earth is still rotating and the sun is still shining on us, except there are just a metric fuckton of clouds that cover the sky aboveme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey won't be forgotten anytime soon, but this emptyness hasn't faded yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks Mark and Ethan for making this one year amazing. #MementoMori",

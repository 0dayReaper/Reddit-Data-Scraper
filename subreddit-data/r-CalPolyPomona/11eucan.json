Typical Mexican household where yelling is the only way of communication. I\u2019m transferring with an associate degree\u2026do y\u2019all think it would be stupid to live on campus to finish my bachelors?",

You don't want to spend most of your money on rent. Unless you have lots of money, then both options are fine, lol.",

Also campus is pretty much dead on the weekends so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re missing out much. If you have friends who do live on campus you can always visit them since you\u2019re so close. I think housing is so so stupid expensive rn and there\u2019s so many other things you can invest or spend on that will be worth your time (tuition, food, save it for grad school, etc). If you lived further than maybe it\u2019d be a good idea but I had a lot of friends who were off campus since they got to CPP and never had trouble being involved.",

They got a lot of HW out of the way bc they had to wait for the drive back to die down. They also used their free time to go to clubs and hit the bric. I know of others who didn't have that discipline and struggled with the commute. Though ur commute isn't far, you have to see if it's worth it to you.",

But your situation seems different, because I assume you will be attending full time and not working... so saving money is probably more essential in that scenario.",

The suggestions to try and stay on campus as much as possible are good. If you get involved in clubs, or extra courses, you will have even more reason to be on campus. \n\nYou can instead try and find roommates and move out to an apartment. Or, you could find friends who live on campus and hang out with them.",

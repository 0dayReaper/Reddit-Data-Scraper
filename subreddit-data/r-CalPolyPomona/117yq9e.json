    "postText": "For context, I'm a VCD major. I'm trying to get 1341A (4D Design) petitioned because I was told that a couple of my classes previously taken at a community college might be equivalent. However, it would have to be at my advisor's discretion. Before my former advisor stepped down, she said she would ask for a second opinion, but I've never heard back. I also talked to my current advisors and couldn't get anywhere with them. I was told to arrange an appointment via Zoom, so I set one up for the 14th. Spoiler alert: I wasn't given an email or text confirmation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I can't get 1341A petitioned, I plan on taking Typography (I've heard it's synchronous for Fall 2023), but I don't know if they can be taken simultaneously or if I need to take 1341A first. What do you guys think?",

            "comment": "You need to take 1341A first. You should have two advisors, Monica Wesley (as a general ENV advisor) and a VCD specific advisor. Check the bottom right hand corner on your bronco direct and right under Ms. Wesley's name should be the name of your advisor. If you can't find their name, contact the chair: awacock @ cpp . edu. \n\nBut you can't take Typography until you've taken: 1311A, 1312A, 1321A, 1331A, and 1341A.",

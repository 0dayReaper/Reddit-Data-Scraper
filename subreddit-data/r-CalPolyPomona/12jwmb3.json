I had semesters where I needed like 2 units or something to get financial aid so I\u2019d just take a gen Ed class that seemed fun. Either that or you can take a bunch of kinesiology classes to fill the gaps like volleyball, archery, stretching. There\u2019s also some beer and wine classes last time I checked.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve taken all your gen Ed requirements up to this point, there\u2019s really not much to do. Best you can do is look at your curriculum and see what electives you can take. I can\u2019t speak for COM but I can speak for someone who\u2019s had multiple semesters/quarters where I couldnt take any core classes and had to fill the gaps in when possible.",

If you just need to fill your schedule you can take whatever classes you want, I suggest trying to find some fully async online classes so you don't have to worry about going to class. If you need the classes to graduate and cant get in then talk to your advisor about it or try emailing the teacher and explaining your situation to see if there's someway they can help you",

            "comment": "Trust the process, put in the work and success will come. Don't focus on the failures, as that will only demotivate you. Focus on how to prevent those failures. You failed a test, alright then life goes on. **You can not change the past, but you can change the future.** Focus on bettering yourself every single moment, actually apply yourself, and success will come. If you need motivation to study then start thinking about \"doing it for yourself.\" Are you going to continue letting the devil on your shoulder persuade you to procrastinate for your next midterm? Or do you have enough self respect to take control of your mind and just do what's best for you. Control your mind and you can do anything. If you apply yourself and fail the next test, then at least you **tried** and very surprisingly, if you continue with this \"becoming the best version of yourself mindset,\" this bad test grade won't make you as stressed as you think it would. In life, you have to fail to learn how to improve and get better, and some point you will find (in this case) the study method/prep that works for you.",

If you feel helpless, remember you aren\u2019t doing this alone and there are always people there to help you. Reach out to your peers, your professor, and the resources on campus like the LRC. You got this!",

If you have the time and patience, (which I don\u2019t have but probably should) you should look into the free tutoring resources available on campus. Also Organic Chemistry Tutor on youtube is a must if you feel like you\u2019re falling behind. Seriously, go watch OGT, he\u2019s the best tutor for Calculus by far and all his videos are completely free. As long as you complete your homework and study using either of those methods I told you, I guarantee that you\u2019ll be completely fine. Good luck.",

In Calc 3, I only took it once but I was half assing it the whole way through. Then there was like a month left of the semester, and I was close to failing. I was bout to transfer to UCSC and needed to pass that class to transfer, so I quit my job &amp; studied like hell (practically taught myself the whole semester in 2 weeks). I was able to somehow do really well to get my grade to a C. Anyways, I was so mad at myself cuz I finally understood it and did well. It made me wish I just took the time to sit down and study and PRACTICE. Practicing Calc is the only way your gonna get it, so DO IT. Do not just read problems, or overlook it. You got to do it till it\u2019s too easy. Lol good luck though! You got it.",

I wouldn't take notes, or solve problems, id just watch as many videos as i could before the semester started.\n\n1. It gets you ahead on the material\n2. You'll be surprised how much your brain absorbs just half-listening to lectures on amy topic\n3. If your prof ends up not being great, it gives you a \"buffer\" to re-strategize before any real damage is done.",

It was a different story. I had to take trigonometry 3 times before i passed. But giving up was not an option.\n\nSuccess has less to do with talent or natural ability and way more to do with being absolutely relentless in pursuit of your goals. Figure out what went wrong, adjust, and try again. Repeat the process until you get the job done. \n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd18",

However, I will say that their whole purpose of sending those messages/ going to the fairs is to have a wide selection of candidates, so competition is a bit harder than just using LinkedIn, in my experience. I will forever preach the better response ratios on LinkedIn for job searches, but Handshake was a good introduction ground in a similar format.",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m an incoming freshman studying mechanical engineering. Do I need a powerful laptop to handle the engineering software? (ie. solidworks) How are the virtual computers? Could you get by using those? Like buy a cheaper laptop that can handle the basics and use those machines when I need access to the engineering programs. Also how about the laptop lending program, it is any good? Lastly, does the bookstore have any good laptop deals? Or do y\u2019all have any good recommendations?",

            "comment": "From my experience I would recommend you get a laptop that will allow you to work anywhere, not tying you down to a lab. I used a laptop with an i7 processor, 16 GB RAM and 1TB HDD. I was able to load all the lab software and work from anywhere and anytime. I would recommend going with a 32 GB RAM version now. If you take care of the laptop it will last for years. Still have mine, which I bought back in 2015.",

But tbh if you don\u2019t plan on using this computer for gaming or CAD projects out of school, or you\u2019re on a tight budget, you can get away with using the virtual computers or the computers on campus, especially if you live on or near campus",

You won\u2019t need to run anything more demanding than solidworks and tbh you only use solidworks for a small handful of classes. If you can find a laptop that\u2019ll run it for cheap do that, but honestly the virtual lab runs pretty well and iirc has 24/7 access as long as you have an internet connection. \n\nOh actually there\u2019s one class where you have to use a finite element analysis program (I forget the name though) which is a bit more demanding than solidworks if you\u2019re doing big projects. \n\nAny gaming pc/laptop will probably be able to run them just fine. Idk about non-gaming computers. Definitely avoid macs/MacBooks",

If you don't go for an ultra book like I did, you could probably get a bit more power and battery life too.   I would just aim for at least 16 gb of ram and 500 Gb of storage.",

Don\u2019t get suckered by all the doofus salespeople in store that once they hear you\u2019re going to engineering for college that you\u2019ll need some $1500+ laptop. You don\u2019t. \n\nEven then, solid works is just one class. Unless you\u2019re doing some club or personal project, you won\u2019t need it again, maybe here and there a couple of random times. I knew plenty of people who didn\u2019t want to spend money on a new laptop and just used the computers on campus to do their stuff in between classes.\n\nI had a laptop that I got for like 900 bucks that had an i7, 16gb ram and integrated graphics, and I did fine with it. Sure it loaded solidworks slower than others fancier laptops but I was able to still use it and do my work without issue.",

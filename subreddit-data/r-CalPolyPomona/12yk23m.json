    "postText": "I\u2019m a little scared I did something wrong for financial aid for CPP. I currently am completing spring semester at a community college and have Fafsa checks from that college, however when I look on my CPP financial aid summary for 2023-2024 it says I don\u2019t have any. It says \u201cyou have no financial aid package available for viewing in this aid year\u201d\u2026..does that mean I won\u2019t get any financial aid?\nI should qualify because I\u2019m already getting financial aid at my current community college for spring semester.\nI did update my Fafsa and put CPP on it when I applied.",

He greets you with enthusiasm before asking you if you can spare some money, and if you don\u2019t have any he\u2019ll try and say that the BSC has an ATM you can use to withdraw money.  I\u2019ve said this before, he has first amendment rights to be here, so he\u2019s allowed to say and ask for whatever he wants. I wouldn\u2019t report him because he hasn\u2019t tried to harass students physically (yet). \n\nThe best way you can avoid scammers like this is the same way you avoid those tech support or extended warranty scams: decline or ignore them, and then move on with your day. (Or troll them if you have time.)",

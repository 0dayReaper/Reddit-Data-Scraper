            "comment": "If you're looking for prestige change your major to Architect lol.\n\nCPP is a very good school for Civil Engineering and our grads are everywhere in SoCal. This means that wherever you go you'll find common ground with employers, plus our school has special relationships with large employers like Edison (who have offices on campus) and I believe SoCal Gas and Caltrans.\n\nEdit. What matters more for your professional development as a civil engineer is what you do outside of school. Once you get into your core classes as a CE you will notice that every class you take is an entire career field that you cann spend your entire life building your knowledge on.\n\nIf you have any questions I am more  than willing to answer",

I especially liked the senior design classes as you go through the entire conceptual and preliminary design of a rocket/satellite/aircraft, present your design to people from Northrop/Boeing/Lockheed etc. and then submit your design to an AIAA competition. A lot of teams from CPP have won or placed in the top 3 in the AIAA competitions, so I'd like to think that the aerospace program compares well against other universities.",

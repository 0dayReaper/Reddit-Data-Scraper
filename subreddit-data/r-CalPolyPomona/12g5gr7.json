Can anyone share some advice or a roadmap that can help me prepare for an accounting career at JPL?\nIf you have questions please ask!",

At the career fair, they sometimes give out goodies. Last year they gave me a hot wheels of the mars Rover!\n\nYou could also try to contact accountants that already work there on LinkedIn to ask for advice and to put your name out there. Remember, the worst they can do is say no, so I don't think you lose anything by trying.\n\nGood luck with your goal, it's totally doable!",

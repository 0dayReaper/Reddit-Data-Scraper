            "comment": "1. Coley\n2. Location, location, location. We're not even in Pomona, separated by two freeways and a 15-minute drive from downtown. There are barely any good places to eat/shop/do without having to drive 15+ minutes and part of the freeway to get there. It kinda feels like we're isolated from the rest of the city with these borders. The only place under a 10 minute drive is the shopping center with the In n Out, Applebee's, etc. You also really have to search to have a good time, out party scene is a joke, Leisurely activities, while not hard to find, are few and far between for Pomona.\n3. Size: I get that we're a \"learn by doing\" school and the campus is reflective of that with the nature preserve and the farmland, but considering how we're 6 times the size of CSUF and 4.5 times the size of CSULB, you think there'd be more here. We probably have less food options and activities than these schools. There's so little that you can just casually do here besides eat at the shitty food court and work out at the gym. We need better and more popular options. It also takes forever to get from class to another class, from the library to the parking lot, etc. The dense size of CSULB and CSUF allows for shopping centers, theaters, parks, etc. to be close enough that you could potentially just walk there. While CPP and those schools differ in academic philosophy, they could make a much better use of their space by catering more to student enjoyment.\n4. The Buildings: This is probably a nitpick, but they all look drastically different in style and architecture from one another and that makes me annoyed. The contrast from the ex. Student Services Building and the sterile, deteriorating tech buildings are so off-putting aesthetically.\n5. NCAA Division II: It really sucks going to a division II school. I have seen practically no examples of school sport culture here. No one really seems excited for games, and it's really sad to see. I've been to division I and division II games in my life and the difference in energy is like night and day. Mt. Sac literally has Hilmer Lodge Stadium and now we seem like the community college. \n6. The Parking Structure: It's too far from the buildings and it looks like it's one bad day from collapsing.\n7. It's just poorly planned: Scattered green space instead of one large space for students to convene, there's always some sort of construction going on, that weird empty space near the rose float lab, the housing is not together (does anyone know what they're going to do with the empty space next to Sicomoro?)\n\nWhere is that $40 million from Mackenzie Scott going lmao",

            "comment": "1. The facilities are antiquated and lack study spots. A lot of the buildings are old and poorly maintained, and the big one near the Japanese garden feels like a ghost town. I can\u2019t believe that we pay tuition to take classes in these settings. We also need way more study spaces. Some schools have study spaces and rooms in every department building; maybe CPP doesn\u2019t have that kind of money, but don\u2019t pretend like you didn\u2019t just get a $40 million donation. Mt. Sac\u2019s leadership got around $750 million in state funding to overhaul its campus; its new student center is almost finished and runs laps around any building that CPP has. How are you going to let a community college outpace you?\n\n2. Almost every one of my courses has group work. It seems as if professors forget that their students have other classes by assigning large scale, semester-long projects. Some teammates can\u2019t contribute to the best of their abilities because they work many hours, and some are just lazy; this hurts the students who have the time and/or motivation to do well. Each department should designate just a few classes to be suitable for team projects and advise students to enroll in one per semester. Also, most of the team projects that I have had are not creative or stimulating enough to qualify as \u201cLearn by Doing\u201d approaches; they\u2019re just extra long assignments that are not worthy enough to be included on a resume or talked about in a job interview. Along with the first point, more and more high school grads are opting for trade programs and bootcamps to start stable, and sometimes even high paying, careers. CPP needs to put itself in a position to acquire students, but it seems like it is pushing them away\n\n3. It\u2019s ridiculous how many professors assign homework though online learning systems like Pearson and McGraw Hill. Yes, it\u2019s possible to learn this way, but it removes a lot of value from the in-class experience, which might be why people skip class imo. If classes are going to be taught like this, then I can most certainly get the same education by self studying through the internet. This isn\u2019t \u201cLearn by Doing.\u201d \n\n3. The food is way too expensive on campus. It seems like the school marks up prices because it knows what a hassle it is to give up your parking spot to grab a meal off campus. You\u2019re supposed to help reduce food insecurity, not magnify it\n\n4. Most of the lockers in the recreation center (BRIC) locker room need to be paid for or are not made available for use, which forces students to pay for the lockers in the middle. Penny pinching at its finest\n\n5. The big parking structure doesn\u2019t look like it was built to withstand heavy rain. Certain areas of each floor are flooded to the point that it looks like you\u2019re driving straight into a lake",

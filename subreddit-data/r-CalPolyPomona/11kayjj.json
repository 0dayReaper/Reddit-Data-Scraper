It happens by mistake, and usually gets stuck in the dish during dish washing when they are scrubbing away with steel wool, and goes unnoticed by cooks.\n\nDefinitely report it. Something like that getting stuck in your GI tract can be trouble.",

This has been like this non-stop since school has gone back to in-person. I'm not sure if there is a good reason for that, but seriously, keep up on soap dispensers.. You don't want poopy hands walking around. To be fair, the one on the wall always works.\n\nAlso, on the happy side props to whoever made the stew today. Good stuff. \n\nBack on the complaining side: Stop overcooking corn on the cob. Boil the water, set a timer, and dump the corn in the pot. When the timer goes off, dump into strainer, and you'll have perfect corn-on-the-cob. I'm sure y'all got a lot going on back there in the kitchen, but I didn't know it was even possible to fuck up corn-on-the-cob that many times in a row. You're on, like, 0/20 right now. And don't even get me started on those carrots. Give vegetables some love. \n\nBack on the happy side: I've eaten a lot of really good food here, and I appreciate the hard work it must take to cook for that crazy amount of people. I just wanted to vent about a few things.",

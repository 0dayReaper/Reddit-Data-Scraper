Overall not a big commitment at all, and getting priority registration is a godsend. This semester\u2019s registration was awful, and while my friends got hardly any majors courses I was the first to get to everything I wanted and all of the hardest to get classes.",

I\u2019m going in next semester but I lowkey wish I had done it when I first came in",

I'm not sure if the school provides legal council, but maybe the Office of Student Life and Cultural Centers or Student Success might be able to assist. Also, check to see if the Real Estate and Law programs have any professors or lecturers who deals with this stuff. Sorry to hear about your struggles OP.",

Great community group doing good work for the Pomonan working class. They have office hours on Tuesday &amp; Thursday from 4-7PM at their office. If you reach out to them, tell them Carlos from Bronco YDSA referred you. Here is their Instagram where they have their office address posted: [https://www.instagram.com/pushcoalition/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/pushcoalition/?hl=en)",

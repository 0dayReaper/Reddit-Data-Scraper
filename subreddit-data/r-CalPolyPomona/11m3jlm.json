    "postText": "So I've been working on the repair cafe, and I've been using old/broken video cards as teaching tools for people to do diagnostics and board repairs before working with student's stuff. Once they are fixed, I have no use for them.  As I was thinking, I was going to sell them on ebay (and use the proceeds to buy more broken video cards to use as diagnostic training tools), but I realized that there might be other websites for selling stuff besides ebay that might be a smaller annoyance to work with.\n\nAny suggestions? Also happy to hand them off to students for a below market price (all proceeds to go back into buying more broken electronics for teaching), but I figure there are only so many of you guys looking for a new card.",

You definitely should document thoroughly how all the proceeds are going back into the program.\n\nThanks for the heads up. I'll double check with Kenneth Lamb about it.  The plan was to do it as payment to the makerspace general funds with a note saying it was for a repaired card where proceeds would go to more broken electronics for training.  But if worst comes to worst, I'll just toss them up on ebay if that's the best way to keep our collective noses clean.  \n\n\nEDIT: and before you worry, so far this is all out of my pocket (mostly asking friends to check for old broken stuff they haven't thrown out) and not a dime of university cash has touched anything I have brought in for teaching.",

The other two cards I was looking at is a 390X to stress test to make sure we took care of everything and a 580 as well.\n\nIf there is a specific one you are looking for, I'll be happy to keep an eye out for it when I go looking for cards that need rehabbing (obviously, no promises).  I'm just looking to go through a bunch so I can show VRAM replacement, retracing, and other sundry cutesy tricks that are easier shown than told.",

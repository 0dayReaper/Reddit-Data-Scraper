    "postText": " Hey Everyone!\n\nI am a first-time freshman deciding between CSUN or Cal Poly Pomona for Biology. If I attended CSUN I would commute, whereas if I attended CPP I would dorm. I would like to pursue higher education, but I am not sure if I want to get a master's or attend med school yet. I was wondering if I can get any insight about the biology program here, any research opportunities, pros and cons, etc. Any input will help, thank you!",

One thing I like about here is that almost all of the Bio/Chem lectures have a lab component that's either a co-requisite or very much available to take. Also we regularly have speakers from different bio fields come and talk and what not, internships nearby, decent amount of research, etc. Will say tho that one con is that its slightly troublesome getting some chemistry classes",

Many seminars/speakers/alumnis come to CPP to talk about the industry or potential job opportunities all the time. The biotechnology building on campus is nice and the professors are well-versed and resourceful.\n\nSource: transfer biotech student currently doing an internship.",

And yet they can\u2019t wrap their heads around that, and so they resort to anger and sometimes throwing (small) items in a fit of rage. 5 min till or after is not what I\u2019m talking about either, more so 20 min-40 min before and after. All I gotta say is\u2026if eating on time is that big of deal you\u2019re gonna throw a temper tantrum, learn how to meal prep, it\u2019s not that hard nor expensive. Hell buy cup of noodles, and I know a someone will say that\u2019s unhealthy\u2026there\u2019s literally guys that eat three orders of tenders\u2026I don\u2019t believe health is that much of a concern LOL",

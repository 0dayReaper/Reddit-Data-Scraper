The timeslots didn't matter because they were broken; people had access hours before their actual timeslots, and by 10-11am only the phase 1 doubles were left. And the nonrefundable fees are so stupid and scummy. I'd rather continue living in the traditional hall than deal with the gross incompetence of Village.",

You would think the $50 application fee and $175 NON-REFUNDABLE fees would go towards improving the application process and website, but no, that seems too logical.",

Someone else even applied at 9:18 but got a time slot earlier than the one at 9:16. So the time you applied didn't really matter ig. Also some people didn't even get a time slot so they just signed in at 9:00 and got a room. Basically, I think the rooms were just a free for all. I was monitoring the rooms available and by 11 am, all the rooms were gone.",

Right now we are currently going through the \"Gathering Data\" phase of it. My group has 100 submissions so far but we would like more to satisfy statistical needs. The survey is 1 minute long and I would really appreciate it if anyone who sees this fills it out. Thank you for your time and please share it if you are willing to!\n\nHere's the link:\n\n[https://forms.gle/RUhe16ndof7Sc9eS9](https://forms.gle/RUhe16ndof7Sc9eS9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the QR code:\n\n[Thank you :\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/byaqmnrnkwwa1.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=23f7f19fc66d1fa3772827063ca9f9fe10ac8d4f)",

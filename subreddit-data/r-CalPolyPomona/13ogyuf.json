Even if they cant teach this class, the dept can rotate the other professors in your dept to teach this one. You can do this! Theres no reason why a part-time teach wont teach this new section, its good money! Its your ECE dept being stingy.  I bet you a million dollars that your department needs to make a call, any call, and any part-time teach would  say yes and teach.  It doesnt hurt to ask the dept, does it? I heard great things about Dr. Adrian Gonzalez from my ECE friends.  Maybe they can teach.",

My friend thinks the part-time teachers got fed up of ECE (it's dpeartment and it's students). If you read that RMP, it seems like its a possibility.  Perhaps ECE should hire full-time teachers.  My ECE friend said part-time teachers teach at inconvenient hours that are not good for students.  And also they make us pay alot of money  for books, but thankfully there was zLib and libGen.  \n\nTalk to the Taneshi to see who they know that can teach ECE and not currently teaching.  Theres some full-time teachers that not even teaching (so selfish of those teachers when the students are in a crisis and have so much mental issues!)  The teachers forgot who there customers are, the students! I work at Carl's Jr. and I know who my customers are!\n\nI also read that theres a strike from RMP. I think it didnt work, otherwise there would be more classes. Maybe ECE should not have accepted so many students and create these long wait lists?",

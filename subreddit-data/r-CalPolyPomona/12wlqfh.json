            "comment": "It\u2019s definitely harder to switch, ME is the most impacted engineering major at CPP. Some of the requirements needed (that don\u2019t even guarantee a major switch) are, B or better in calculus 1 and 2 and B or better in Physics 1510. If you are willing to put in the work it\u2019s definitely rewarding, however if engineering is not so much of a passion for you then it might be a pain in the butt.",

            "comment": "What the other commenter said is right on point. Get as good grades this first year as you can. Typically speaking, mechanical engineering tends to be more difficult than manufacturing engineering. The material is pretty different between the two, you can\u2019t really switch one out for the other. At the end of the day, you shouldn\u2019t be choosing a major based on how easy or hard it is, it should be about what you\u2019re interested in and what you ultimately want to do after college.",

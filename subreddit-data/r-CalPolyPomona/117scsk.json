Sure, the F on the transcript looked bad but I retook the class with a different professor and got an A and grade forgiveness took the F off the transcript. Now I've been working as an engineer for the last 5 years and have no regrets.",

Also, not that it\u2019s not possible, but having to go revisit five weeks of material to improve for the final, while learning all the new stuff and dealing with other classes will be hard, and it would suck to have potential As drop to Bs and Bs drop to Cs because you tried bringing this grade up. And it would be worse if you got a D+ and your other grades dropped.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m being pessimistic, but I feel like I\u2019d rather start fresh, especially because I wouldn\u2019t be happy with a 5 unit C anyway. I guess it really depends on how much work you\u2019re willing to put in. You also have to consider your track record with math. If you regularly got As and Bs in the last, and this is just a mishap, then maybe there\u2019s hope. But if you constant got Cs and low Bs, then idk if recovering the F to the C would be feasible.",

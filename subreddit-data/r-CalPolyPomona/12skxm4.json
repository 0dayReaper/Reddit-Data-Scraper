            "comment": "Looking at the curriculums they\u2019re probably fairly comparable and there\u2019s no real difference in faculty number that emphasize biochemistry. I know that the laboratory training at CPP is phenomenal from experience (I took 1 lab per chem lecture), and if you take classes from the bio department as well you\u2019ll get a good background. I think CPP makes you take a bit more lab courses that CSUF. Depends on how important that is and what you wanna do after college.",

The only thing I prefer at Pomona is that half of the professors I\u2019ve taken have allowed cheat sheets. That\u2019s not a thing at Fullerton. At most, the professor will provide some formulas.",

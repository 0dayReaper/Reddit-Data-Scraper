On a cursory search, there\u2019s no Dr. Katherine Baker working at CPP. \n2. The use of the word \u2018kindly\u2019 in the emails. It\u2019s not a common word for native english speakers to use, but it\u2019s a word that pops up a lot when you use google translate and scammers overseas. \n3. Those emails almost always ask you to provide your personal, non-EDU emails.\n4. In similar emails I\u2019ve gotten, which I have quite a few, they always type the pay in a really weird way. For example, \u201c\u2018600\u2019 (USD)\u201d. idk about you but that is not a normal or legitimate way to write that, haha\n5. Not to mention their emails is always something crazy. The last one I got had their domain as the Kenyan Rural Roads Authority lmfao",

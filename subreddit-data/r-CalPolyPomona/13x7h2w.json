It says my registration window isn\u2019t valid and I don\u2019t have one. \nI\u2019m frustrated because my in person orientation is on July 28th and the semester starts august 21st. \nDid I do something wrong or will everything align and be ok on orientation date?",

They will also give you a road map and a curriculum sheet to help you understand what classes are prerequisite for other classes. Don\u2019t worry about not finding classes or classes being full, because each department will save seats for most classes for incoming transfer students. When I came in as a transfer student I was able to get all the classes I want.",

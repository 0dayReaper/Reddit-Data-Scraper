I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time here, the classes can be tough but the best part is the clubs and projects. There\u2019s so many to choose from and they all have awesome people doing really cool work. Personally I\u2019ve joined 3 of the larger clubs in ARO to get a bunch of different experience and it\u2019s been very rewarding. Went from no interview offers to 4 interviews and an offer for an internship this summer.",

I\u2019ve never not gotten a class that set me back, one is hard to get but it\u2019s not a prereq so you can take it whenever. As for clubs, there are some that are geared toward freshmen or transfers with little experience, and some that require a bit of knowledge. None are going to be crazy selective but ones like LRL or some projects under Bronco Space generally look for prior project experience, internship, etc.",

I just want to share an interesting video of the General Dynamics factory that was built just outside of the CPP campus back in the 1950s.  The residential neighborhoods that were built to house many of the workers are still there.  I believe the CPP aerospace department developed around the same time when the LA area had a booming aerospace industry before Boeing beat out and bought out McDonnell Douglas.  There was a bit of an aerospace downturn in the late 80's as portrayed by the aerospace engineer character of the move Falling Down played by Michael Douglas.  The GD factory has since been torn down and replaced by a warehouse.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukaZZ\\_lZ5vM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukaZZ_lZ5vM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFalling Down Trailer\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD5ofrSNDFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD5ofrSNDFA)",

Too many courses are taught only once a year due to the lack of Professors. This means that there are like 6 or more classes that if you fail any one you add 1 year to your stay.",

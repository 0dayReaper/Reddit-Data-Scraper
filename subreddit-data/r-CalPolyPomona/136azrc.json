    "postText": "Hi I just got off the waitlist and have been looking over everything to apply for housing. Does anyone know what the chances are that if I pick a normal double room that I will get to be in the new Secoya/Sicomoro buildings? They seem to be more modern and closer to the dining hall so I\u2019d love to dorm there. Also is it too late for me to be there if I\u2019m only applying for housing now?",

            "comment": "I believe your in a good spot in terms of timing. Generally speaking, if your orientation is coming coming up soon and you haven\u2019t registered for housing, that\u2019s a problem. I met a guy at orientation who was 90+ on waitlist for housing since he registered in mid-June. So I think you should have a pretty good chance especially since the dorms have much more doubles compared to singles and triples( I dunno about traditional).\n\nAs for chances to get Sicomorro/ Sequoia over traditional, it\u2019s honestly a 50/50 leaning towards what you put first on the application. \n\nAlso by mid-June is when you\u2019ll receive the information of where you will dorm (including floor and room #) and who your dorm mates are (if you didn\u2019t co-sign up beforehand) inside the housing portal.",

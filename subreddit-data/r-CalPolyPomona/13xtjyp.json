They should make some permanent ones. Maybe add LEDs like the CSUSB campus. They have some nice new letters that light up on their campus. Ours is missing that. The ones on the hill are ok but these are a pretty cool photo prop and it seems like most of the campuses have them such as Long Beach\u2019s \u201cgo beach\u201d letters and CSUF \u201cTitans\u201d. Hope we get them back.",

If this was temporary the campus spent money to have the CPP made which was metal, spent money to have that concrete pad made specifically for it, which coved the original part of the plant landscape, had anchor bolts put in for the structure, and then when I saw it installed, there were workers there taking the day to hand pinstripe the yellow lines on the letters, it didn't come that way, it was hand-painted on site. A significant amount of work was done for this just to have it now taken away. I guess it is better to play games instead of dealing with real issues on campus.",

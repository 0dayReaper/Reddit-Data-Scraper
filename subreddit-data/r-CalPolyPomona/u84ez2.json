YouTube sends a plaque at that milestone, and I said I would show the plaque when it arrived, so here it is. It's very shiny.\n\nOnly 900k more to go until we get gold status.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZScjkZuVuvwa-JVA3mHO3w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZScjkZuVuvwa-JVA3mHO3w)\n\nIt will be placed in a case near Lita's office in building 17 in the near future.",

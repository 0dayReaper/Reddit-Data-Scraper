    "postText": "I only need one class to graduate and my Professor hasn\u2019t submitted my grades or communicated about what grade I earned. I am stressing because I\u2019m supposed to walk tomorrow and if I didn\u2019t pass this class then I will not be graduating. I don\u2019t know what to expect. I didn\u2019t submit my best work or even as high of quality work as I\u2019d like, but I submitted what was needed to turn in. I don\u2019t know what to expect if I don\u2019t pass or how to know what to do right now. I can\u2019t keep emailing my professor. It\u2019s coming off super unprofessional. Cannot relax because I\u2019m constantly going back to check my emails and my grades on broncodirect. Someone please let me know what I should do.",

They\u2019re human too, they want to get to summer vacation just as much as us. I really wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much. You will still get to participate in commencement no matter what happens. Enjoy the day, in all likelihood you probably passed!",

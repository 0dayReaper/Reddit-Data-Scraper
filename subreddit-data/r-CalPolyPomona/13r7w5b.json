    "postText": "I was planning to take chemistry at a CC but decided not to. Does it matter when I take the course? Cause im an electrical engineering major, so I don't think it's a prerequisite for any of the courses I need to take in the future. I just need confirmation on whether to take or not.\n\nP.S. since I'm an engineer, does it take longer to get my degree? Also, I'm already attending cpp. I was gonna take chemistry over the summer to transfer the credits",

            "comment": "If you can take it at CC take it imo. I\u2019m EE and you need CHM 1150 or 1210 to take ECE 2200. I took it over the summer at CC because I didn\u2019t want to take it over the regular semester at CPP. Keep in mind that 1150 is chem for engineers and 1210 is general chem 1 so some CC don\u2019t usually have chem for engineers only general chem 1. I\u2019d say CC it\u2019s a bit more lenient and cheaper than taking it at CPP. You can just transfer the credits once you pass chem over the summer. Also check how long the summer session is and that it will go fast bc it\u2019s summer session.\nTake a look at the roadmap to see the prereqs for each course.\nAssist is a website to see what courses can be transferable.\n\nhttps://assist.org/\n\nhttps://www.cpp.edu/academic-programs/academic-advising/tools/sheets-roadmaps/index.shtml",

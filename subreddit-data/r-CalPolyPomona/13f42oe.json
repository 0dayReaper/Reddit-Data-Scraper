Darweesh is pretty good professor that does his best to explain the subject matter even when it is dry, but it is focused on the 3 group projects he gives you and the quizzes that are done online. Young's is good in explaining his part of his class and most of his points revolve around the quizzes and the 2 papers he makes you write.",

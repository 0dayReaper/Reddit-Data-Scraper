If it is a prerequisite another class you are planning to take,  you need better than a C-.\n\nYou don't \"have\" to retake the it with a  D, but it is recommend you do so if you have extra space in your semester terms before you graduate since having that slog down ur GPA would not exactly be ideal for your future internship/job apps or if planning to go to grad school. Check out cpp's policies on course repetition and grade forgiveness since there is a cap to how many units you can apply grade forgiveness on. Of course this depends on what you really want so you may wanna fully think through that too.",

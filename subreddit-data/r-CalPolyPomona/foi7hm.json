    "postText": "I just received an email from one of my professors and learned that Dr. Chandra passed away last night. If you never had the pleasure of meeting him or having him as a professor he was one of the nicest people I ever met here at Cal Poly, or in general. I had the honor of working under him the summer before my first semester at the University for a research program from the community college I transferred from. I was so nervous when I came on campus for the first time, but after meeting him he put all of my fears aside and made the summer a joy. My thoughts go out to his friends, family and colleagues.",

I remember the first time he brought the O2 tank was 2 years ago around Spring, and it got worse as time went on.  \n\n\nHe was one of the few profs who would stay in his office late until about 8pm, even when he wasn't teaching any classes. I remember that he asked me to walk him to his car or wait for his ride to show up. Even when he retired, he still supported his students; props to that too.",

He managed to both teach you and keep your attention on the subject at hand. He was friendly and yet wouldn't hesitate to chastise me for slacking. Truly a great motivator.\n\nOne standout thing I remember about him was his experience with smoking and his pulmonary fibrosis. He ALWAYS made it a point to callout any smokers in the class, in an effort to get them to stop. He always looked out for his student's well being inside and outside of the classroom.",

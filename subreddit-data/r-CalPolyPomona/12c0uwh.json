    "postText": "I got into economics instead. I am still in high school. I took AP Computer science principles, calculus ab, and physics in high school my gpa was around 4.0 in junior year.  my lowest grade was a C which i had in math class (not calculus). I had some extra curricular activities here and there but none of my extracurricular activities was related to computer science. I\u2019m disappointed and I would like to know why I was not accepted into comp sci. Is it because of my extracurriculars? I\u2019m not sure what to do now. My true interests lie within computer science field and I think I would be good at it. Maybe there is something I am not seeing. If there is anyone who was in similar situation with me I would love to hear your advice. Thanks.",

            "comment": "Here are a couple thoughts from a CPP alumni and someone with an econ degree:\n\n1. Econ at CPP is notorious for having bad professors, so keep that in mind.\n2. Econ itself is an amazing degree that has aspects of business, finance, and life in general. Almost every question in life can be answered in some way with the basic principles of economics.\n\nAs a worst case scenario, you could still major in econ and teach yourself CS on the side. A lot of jobs just require the degree as a pre req for applying, you could still easily get a CS job with the econ degree if you're competent in CS.\n\nStay optimistic, the cards are still in your favor overall.",

    "postText": "Hey guys I\u2019m going to be an incoming freshmen next year and I had a question about the provisional acceptance. What gpa/grades will get your offer rejected? I have a been a 3.8 student but senioritis has been kicking my ass lately. I have a 3.3 non weighted and and 3.7 weighted. Only one C right now but i assume the only way to get your offer taken is if you get below a 3.0/get a D or F right?",

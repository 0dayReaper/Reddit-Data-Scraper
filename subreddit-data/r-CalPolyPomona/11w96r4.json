    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in MtSac where semesters are like this:\nSpring 16 weeks\nSummer 6 weeks\nFall 16 weeks\nWinter 6 weeks\n\nAnd we usually have 1 or 2 weeks off between them. (I usually don\u2019t take classes in the 6-weeks sessions so I can work full time, and I was wondering if I could do the same here). I\u2019m really unfamiliar with how semesters work at CPP and I was wondering if you could orientate me a little bit. I tried looking up for the academic calendar but I ended up being more confused.",

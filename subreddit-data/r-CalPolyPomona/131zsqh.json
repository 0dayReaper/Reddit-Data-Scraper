    "postText": "Hello, I am a transfer student planning to attend CPP for Fall 2023. I had to choose between CSULB and CPP, but since I heard some weird things about the CS Program at CSULB, CPP seemed like a better option.  \nI was looking at the Fall 2023 CS Upper Division classes, and it looks like there are not many spots left and most of the classes, the only ones left are with very poorly rated professors.\n\nWould you guys say that there are not many options for Upper Division classes at CPP, or different professors? It seemed like there was not many options to choose from classes and professors. Is it like this every semester?\n\nAlso, if you are a CS major or graduate, what is your opinion on the program?",

I believe there are options for classes in upper division but it\u2019s more about what field in cs you are interested in. For me I like the theoretical side of it so I wouldn\u2019t take something like game development. As for professors I would say its 50/50 by the time you\u2019re in upper division you know which are the good professors",

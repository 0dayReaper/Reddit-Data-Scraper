He\u2019s a harsh grader when it comes to the class work but his overall grading at the end seems to be a bit more lenient.\n\nTrust me when I say to do the assignments his way because he will dock you hard if you don\u2019t. He\u2019s a lot better as an upper div prof than he his teaching classes like dynamics. Tough professor but doable in this class.",

On exams, you basically get credit till your first mistake and then you lose any points after that. He does add a curve but he was one of my most stressful professors in my time at CPP.",

Talk to him, show interest in the material, and ask design questions that aren't related to the class. He's pretty nice even though he has a reputation for being tough.",

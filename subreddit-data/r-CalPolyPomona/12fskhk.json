Do the homework (actually try to do it), and practice the fundamentals of engineering questions in your text book because he uses those on his exams.\n\nCool story: I was in the room when he caught a student cheating during an exam (prior to Covid). He told the student to come up to the front of the class to turn in their exam, and when they didn\u2019t he yelled at them to turn it in. He then made the student write out on the exam \u201cI was caught cheating on the exam and will suffer the consequences of my actions\u201d and sign it. I never saw that student again.",

I was worried that it would be really hard to pass since he doesn't allow formula sheets on exams, but I ended up doing better than I expected\u2014I think B+ or something like that.\n\nI supplemented the lectures with Prof. Miller's videos, especially for the various heat engines.",

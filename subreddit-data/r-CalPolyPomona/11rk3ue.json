What the photographer finds reasonable for their quality of work and package you may not, and it can be interpreted as you trying to dictate their price point.\n\nTypically, it would be better to make inquires and state that you are on a budget. This way, it\u2019s not a demand, but an indicator to those providing the service that they should start by offering the more basic services. \n\nIn the case of photographers, they may reduce the amount of time for the shoot or the number of prints offered, to cut costs. There may be more expensive packages that include the enhanced image files or even the raw files, which they may not offer because of the higher price point, but will let you know the price differential if you ask.\n\nAlso, if someone gets back to you with a price, it\u2019s not a good idea to say, \u201cwhy so much?\u201d People actually do this, but it\u2019s not cute. I know people who will end the transaction the minute they get that response. \n\nBest thing to do after getting a quote is to say, \u201cthank you, give me some time to think about it and I will get back to you.\u201d Then you move on and get other quotes to get a general idea of what the pricing is like and go with the quote that is best for your budget.\n\nTruth is, many of us in service as independent contractors are happy and willing to work with our clients through budget concerns, but at our discretion, never by demand.",

Heck, OP might even find a friend who will do it for a \"reasonable price\" that they agree with off-the bat. \n\nDuring my 3rd and 4th year, I charged my friends only dinner + gas money (if the location was far) because I found more value in maintaining a relationship than making $1-200. Maybe that's an arrangement they'll be able to somehow find. Best of luck to you, OP.",

I understand they may be younger and may not have dealt with these types of transactions before, but for that reason, I think my comment could benefit OP before actually reaching out to people to make inquiries.\n\nI don\u2019t see any problem with my comment because I presented why that phrasing can be problematic through how it might be perceived, and how some people might react to it. But I also provided alternative language that could yield better results, i.e., modifications to the service to more closely align with their budget.",

Obviously, no clothes with obscene images or curse words, but thats about it as far as restrictions. Consider that on some days they might ask you to walk around campus your entire shift or carry things from A to B. So wear shoes that allow you to do that. Also, the offices on campus can tend to get chilly, especially when it's hot outside and the AC is on all day. So its a good idea to keep a light sweater handy or even keep one at the office if they have a safe place for you to leave things.",

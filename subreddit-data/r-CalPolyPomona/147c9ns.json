    "postText": "Hello, I recently discovered the NASA MITTIC challenge. I wanted to know if anyone else at cal poly pomona had already formed a team that I could join. I see on their website that applications are open this year from august 7 - october 16 and teams are usually 3-10 people. Please reach out, if there isn't already a team, maybe we can form one together. \n\n[https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasamittic](https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasamittic)",

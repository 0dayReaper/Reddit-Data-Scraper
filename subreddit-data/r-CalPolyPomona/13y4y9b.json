    "postText": "I had a question about the math placement test for incoming freshman. This is more for a family member but they mentioned they need to go in person for a proctored math placement test. I just don\u2019t understand why going in person is necessary? I myself am in college going to a university and our math and chem placement tests were online. Instead (and we definitely don\u2019t live close to Cal Poly), my family has to take the $500 trip for a test taken in a room\u2026 on a computer.\n\nNote: I recognize I\u2019m being really  salty it just doesn\u2019t make any sense why the test needs to be in person when there are many other schools that can do it perfectly fine online.",

But because they couldn\u2019t do so they\u2019re asking people to come in person. Ig it is good to know you were able to do it online, would def make it easier for us. Thanks for the knowledge.",

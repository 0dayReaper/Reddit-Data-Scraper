I was going to give her my information cause I saw everything but wasn\u2019t able to. So I left my info with Campus police just in case she called. \nIt sucks that people see these things and also just think, \u201cnot my problem.\u201d \nIt\u2019s sad how many hit and runs seem to be happening. I bring my older car to campus now and all of a sudden there\u2019s a dent over the driver side tire. I\u2019m 95% sure it happened on campus.",

Its a misdemeanor under California vehicle code 20002.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe specific obligation for hitting a parked vehicle if you cannot locate/identify the driver, is to leave your name and address. A separate requirement under vehicle code 16025 also requires you to leave insurance information. Its a couple hundred dollar fine for failing to provide either.",

    "postText": "I receive EBT and wanted to use it to get lunch today at the pony express. After looking it up to make sure they took EBT I went and grabbed food only for them to tell me at the register they don't take EBT. Why has it listed on the website that they do??? Also, why would the school bother to help students get EBT (as the poly pantry claims they do) only for students to not be able to use it on campus?? I'm grateful to receive EBT in the first place and I truly only use it on a need-to-use basis; I commute from over an hour away and some days I don't have the time to pack a lunch. I guess the part that frustrates me the most is the fact that the website says they do indeed take EBT only for me to have to make the choice to use my debit card or starve.\n\nEdit: I've since realized that the article I saw claiming that three locations on campus took EBT was from 2020. While it's on me that I didn't 100% check and verify that the information is correct, I still find it kind of ridiculous that the **highlighted** search result is out of date on something like this. I wrote this post in the heat of the moment and was just frustrated to be completely blindsided like that. Lesson learned to triple-check publishing dates and ask first, but also it would be nice if the school didn't have out-of-date information as the highlighted answer. ",

You work on excel assignments as a group but she provides you with a video on how to do it beforehand so you're just copying it straight.\n\nHer exams are shit but doable. Def study for them and have her decks ready when you take them.\n\nI took her class for a full semester but I've heard it's just as easy during the summer.",

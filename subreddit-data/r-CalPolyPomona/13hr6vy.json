I can relate to lots of it, especially about Newtonian mechanics (that class I just did awful in) and doing worse than the people that did bad (notably, in Newtonian mechanics). Did AP, honors, and dual enrollment in high school and graduated 2nd in my class (though I was better at writing than most things, my school wasn\u2019t very math or science focused) so yea it hits hard when you bomb exam after exam, insult to injury knowing that my college education is partially funded by scholarships, so there\u2019s guilt that comes with that. Grading scale implies that I will pass the course with a C which stinks a lot but I\u2019ll bounce back from it. I don\u2019t know if passing it or retaking it is better though haha grade forgiveness does seem sweet. Thanks for the podcast",

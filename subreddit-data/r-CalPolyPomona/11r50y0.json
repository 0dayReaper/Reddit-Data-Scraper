    "postText": "I'm falling behind my group and passing 1510 in the summer would really help. But I'm curious if anyone has taken them. I already failed 1510 once (with Comran Nouri). Not for lack of trying tho. I worked my ass off but it wasn't enough. \n\nAnybody have some insight?\n\nI'm currently enrolled in Chem 1210 with Harikawa who i heard good things about. But it's at the same time as others",

Professor Ryan is the nicest teacher I have ever taken, she really cares about her students succeeding. Neither of them is a hard teacher but if I had to choose one to take it'd be Professor Ryan.",

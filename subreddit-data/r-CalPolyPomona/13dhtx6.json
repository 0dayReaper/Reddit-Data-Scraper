    "postText": "What do professors have against just telling us what's explicitly going to be on the final. After my (many) years in college. One thing that will always frustrate me is when professors post \"study guides\" and its literally just. Study everyday. Yet they know it's impossible to test on every single subject. They know that most people can't retain that info in just a 3 month period. But still insist with just not being explicit about what to study. \nAfter all this time I think I'm just tired of the BS. I'm just getting less and less patient with school at this point. \ud83d\ude43",

There are things that we can't put on the final because there's only so many questions we can ask in two hours, but these concepts could save your (or someone else's) ass in the future. We don't want you to miss 'em.",

I thin most professors are filled with an ego that they want to be the best teachers that they really lose sight of what happens in the real world. I graduated with an AA in chemistry but was able to work up the ladder to be a microbiologist. Most of my coworkers had bachelor degrees. Nothing in school prepared them for Standard Operating procedures and FDA Audits. School is mostly bullshit. It\u2019s a money making machine used to give people a piece of paper that says \u201chey look I like this field and know some shit about it. Can I work for you!\u201d",

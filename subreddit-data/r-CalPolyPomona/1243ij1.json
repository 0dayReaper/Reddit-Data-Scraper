You might get a recruiter who likes what school you went to, who knows.\n\nFrom 4 people on my team alone who are my age here\u2019s where they graduated from: USCD, UCR, CSUN, and me at CPP. My teammates are all really good engineers in their own way and I\u2019m sure they can say the same about me. We all work for Boeing, so in general it\u2019ll be higher than say a federal job at entry level. Did our degrees play a factor? Who knows? But I\u2019ll say this was my first and only offer out of 100s of applications since I graduated",

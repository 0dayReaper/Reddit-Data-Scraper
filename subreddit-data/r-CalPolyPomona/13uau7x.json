But no one really knows unless YOU try, and I say you should.\n\nThe good thing is CPP nor your major are impacted, which gives you a better chance.\n\nTry competing all of their requirements before you transfer and any supemental requirements they may want for your major. I will provide the link below.\n\nhttps://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/impacted-majors.shtml",

            "comment": "CPP's Psychology department is mediocre and overshadowed by the larger majors and disciplines.\n\nResearch and professional opportunities are sparse even with the support programs like the McNair Scholar's Program. You basically have to go off campus and find them yourself (for example a girl I knew got a sweet research deal at a hospital and eventually USC, the school newspaper even wrote about her).\n\nA few professors do research, but its very narrow and you'll burn yourself out if you're not passionate about it.  Most if not all Psych students here just see CPP as a spring board for where they really want to go.\n\nThe professional opportunities are non existent because hardly anyone (especially the people running the department) know anything about internships (yes they're possible at the undergrad level), relevant jobs, and even careers (the mandatory careers in psych elective is hardly helpful because most profs don't have lived experience).\n\nI'm currently working instead of doing grad school, but some of my classmates and acquaintances felt like CPP didn't offer much in terms of getting into PhD programs so they opted to do Master's programs instead; in that way they could have a better chance of getting into their intended degree programs.\n\nPsi Chi (the Psych honors society) is probably the most helpful resource for CPP Psych majors. I found out more real world info from them rather than my classes and instructors.",

Most Ph.D programs want demonstration of publication potential--meaning you need to have ALREADY published in order to just get into the door. So a little bit of hubris-checking is important. Most people in the MA program don't get into the Ph.D programs until they publish their paper and have a few years of paid experience under their belt.",

Psych department is huge and courses are very impacted--just like the parking. It's surprisingly hard to find a place to sit down or a computer to find in the library if you need to print something quick. So the major downside is capacity there. Grad students in Psych have a Lab room with their own computers on a separate floor. The facilities are really nice at Fullerton. It's also flat and there are a lot more food options. Again, there is still an issue with long lines since they have way more students.",

            "comment": "It has been an experience. I'm getting close to graduation and still feel like I have no idea where I'm going, and quite a few of my classes have been \"figure it out yourself\" classes because I got unlucky with the professor. Most of the professors teaching for the psychology major are accomplished people who have a lot of backing and accomplishments behind their names, but they're not teachers.\n\nUnless you get lucky to find one of the ones who's really passionate about teaching, expect to mostly be relying on the textbook and online to learn. Though, maybe you'll get lucky and get the same professor who didn't grade anything the whole semester and gave everyone an A with 0/0 points?",

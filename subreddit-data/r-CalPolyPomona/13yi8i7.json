    "postText": "so orientation is coming up and we have to choose classes. was wondering which option between the two would be better \n\n\\- cs 1400 introduction to programming and problem solving  \nprofessor: huong luu \n\n\\- cs 1280 introduction to c++   \nprofessor: thanh nguyen \n\ni've heard some horror stories about professor nguyen so i wasn't sure which one i should pick but because of those stories, i'm leaning towards my first option. i also heard that professor luu is a bit lenient, but i also heard she is new? i'm just wondering what would be the better option for a person who's not too confident in their abilities in cs",

            "comment": "well, IMHO, you\u2019re gonna have to learn A LOT of things in cs on your own. If you aren\u2019t confident in your abilities yet i would start with Java. programming is a way of thinking using logic to solve problems so the knowledge you gain learning java can \u201ctranslate\u201d to when you learn other languages. Because 2400 is also in java i would stick with 1400 and take 1280 after 2400 if that is feasible so you are not overwhelmed with learning multiple different syntaxes at the same time.",

Sometimes she even gives out answers for hw during class time and your assigned a section every 2 week ish. I\u2019m not sure about the other professor so this was just my experience w 140\nEdit: I\u2019ve never taken a CS class before this or even touched coding.",

If you\u2019re a huge class it helps a lot. Especially if you\u2019re more to the side where her computer is",

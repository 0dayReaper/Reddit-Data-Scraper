The school is allowing a record number of students into an already impacted university for the reason of \"Money\" in the meme above. And you are asking me if I think allowing more students into the already **impacted** student body, (so impacted that CIS is trouble hiring full time staff) and allow a student their \"dream\" because President Coley, as Mr. Krabs, wants money. doesnt this agree with my argument that this is called greed? Make a decision based making the most amount money without much regard of anything else? so again, how many times am i going to have to teach you this lesson old man? \ud83e\udd73",

Let's say Mr. Krabs gets $1 profit per Krabby Patty. If Mr. Krabs sells 159,000 more Krabby Patties, he will earn $159,000. President Coley's salary does not increase in a similar manner. \n\nI'm not saying increasing the total amount of students without immediately hiring a proportional amount of staff and faculty, nor immediately adding a proportional amount of classroom space and parking, is the best option for CPP. But the meme doesn't really make sense from my point of view. \n\nI don't know what the plans are for the total number of faculty, parking spaces, etc... for the next five years, which is the timeframe the President is probably thinking about. I hope both the students and faculty will get the necessary support to keep CPP as a great university.\n\nI think I should have added a sarcasm emoji to my earlier post... I was just fanning some flames.",

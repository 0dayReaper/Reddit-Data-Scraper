    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI've created a new tool for CPP students:\n\n[https://gradetier.com/](https://gradetier.com/)\n\nWith GradeTier, you can see grade distribution information for over 30,000 past CPP courses, including which instructor taught which course. All undergraduate and graduate departments from Fall 2015 - Fall 2019 should be included, with the exception of ~~Winter 2019 and~~ courses with fewer than 10 students.\n\nThere are no paywalls, just a simple design: first choose Cal Poly Pomona, then select a department (and optionally a course number), and click on the desired course.\n\nI initially made a website for CSU Fullerton a little over two months ago. Since it received positive reactions from their community, I thought I would add data for additional public universities throughout California. This data was received via a [California Public Records Request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Records_Act).\n\nIn addition to other sources like RateMyProfessor, I'm hoping the website can serve as an objective piece of information when deciding which courses to take.\n\nLet me know what you think, and contact me if you find any issues - thanks!\n\nEDIT 1: Cal Poly Pomona switching from the quarter to the semester system means winter is no longer a term.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: It appears some courses are missing.

    "postText": "Does anybody know why it took CPP till Winter 2019 to bring Eduroam  on-board when campuses like Fullerton had it in 2016? The polytechnic school being behind the curve was always a bit strange for me and I'm looking for the wisdom of the crowd to better understand the delay here.  I think it would be a good polypost article.",

    "postText": "So moral of the story, I\u2019m taking BIO 1210 with a professor which I\u2019ll leave anonymous for the time being, but I\u2019m preparing for a exam by doing the study guides the professor gives, and these study guides are in line with lecture from start to finish. And so, when I opened up my lecture notes on the bottom right hand corner I could see another professors name from CSUN (Cal state northridge) and I was like hold up is this what I think it is. In being a whole investigator into this matter, I went to see if this was shown on canvas where we download said slides, and nothing, until, I noticed that it\u2019s covered up and you could see the letter \u201cE\u201d barely cut off from the word northridge, and to my surprise if you hover the mouse cursor on it, it\u2019ll give an option to highlight whatever is beneath there. So for now the real question (hella sorry but I had to to give context) can professors do this, cause I would think that it would fall under some type of law that prohibits from them doing it.",

They also may be using slides provided by a textbook used in the past that originated at that school. The CSU has almost identical course competencies for similar classes anyway due to transfer students and articulation. \n\nThis isn't a big deal or an issue, at all. If this is your biggest concern, you got it very easy.",

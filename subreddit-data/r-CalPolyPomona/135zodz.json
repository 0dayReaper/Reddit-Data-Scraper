    "postText": "Constantly not picking up the phone, not returning messages, ignoring in-person follow ups. It's been months. My mental health has hit rock bottom and more and I have had no help at all from CAPs. CAPs was my only hope but it seems like many other resources on campus, to be completely FUCKING USELESS. I am most likely going to drop out because of this shit.",

They just opened and are right underneath The Marketplace (where Panda Express is) and are next to the Career Center.",

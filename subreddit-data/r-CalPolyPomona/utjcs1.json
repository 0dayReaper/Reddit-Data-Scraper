Might take a bit cause for something so small it took a surprising amount of time to make by hand :\u2019)",

The brick is definitely not smooth so I went at it with sandpaper to get it uniformly flat, marked out a midline on one side of the resulting rectangle, and sanded two sides down to meet that to create the triangular prism shape, before knocking off one of the ends to give it the point. The remaining end should be flat. \nAt this stage the shape would be right but its missing the details, namely the triangle hole and the notches. The notches I just took the smallest file I own and filed them out, and the hole I first drilled through before going back to the files to shape it into the triangle.  Finally went in with some brown paint to highlight the details and paint in the windows, before sealing it with some random spray varnish I had laying around. Still trying to see if I can find a way to actually carve out the surface windows somehow but its just so tiny lol",

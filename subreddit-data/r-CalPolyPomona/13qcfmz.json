My ECE friend told me a part-time professor made about 1000-1100 per month for one class per semester.  It's cheaper to hire PT professors with no benefits than hiring full-time profs.  In FRL, new full-time profs leave within a few years after being denied tenure.  We were told its due to the student ratings. LOL.  In ECE, that's not the case.  I hear you guys don't even get new FT profs.  It's a scam IMHO.\n\nThe FRL PT profs have relatively higher paying FT jobs, so I think they are not teaching CPP for the money. They would be fine financially if CPP told them to leave.  Is that true for PT ECE professors? Just wondering.",

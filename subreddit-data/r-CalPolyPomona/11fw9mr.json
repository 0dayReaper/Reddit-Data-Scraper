    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n1 recently got admitted to Cal Poly Pomona for the Fall 2023 semester for Computer Engineering as a transfer student. For anybody that has attended or is attending CPP as a CE or EE, how is it like? Are students able to find internships during summer?\nHave you guys heard of any stories of what students move on to do after they graduate? Also, are there fine girls in the CE department? A buddy of mine told me that there were lots of attractive girls lol",

            "comment": "I did EE and my brother did CE, but we ended up taking most of the same classes. From my observation CE varies between schools and is either closer to an EE degree or a CS degree. CE at CPP is definitely closer to an EE degree in the sense that you basically complete an EE degree for the first half of the program anyway. \n\nMost people I knew found internships (specifically in defense and power) but there are a few other places that hire from CPP like JPL. Getting an internship is more about applying on time and preparing on your own for interviews than about getting a certain degree. \n\nThere aren't many girls in the ECE department when I was there, but maybe that has changed recently. You could always branch out and find other groups at CPP if you're looking to meet people.",

            "comment": "EE here.\n\n1. Not a lot of ladies here. You don't go to engineering school for the ladies.\n\n2. You can definitely get internships here.  I have had 2 so far at a startup in LA and one at Ohio. Take advantage of the connections this school has because this school is well connected to lots of the big name companies like Boeing, JPL, etc. \n\n3. CpE is definitely more similar to EE here then CS.\n\n4. I have heard people go to mainly defense or FAANG companies after they graduate. A handful went to small R&amp;D companies. I know a couple that went to a government organization like NASA, NSA, etc.",

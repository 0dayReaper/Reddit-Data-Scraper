I\u2019m in child education we have a tight knit program so honestly I recognize a lot of people throughout my classes since we are a smaller program compared to CS major. I enjoy my professors. Besides not being able to have any excuse of being absent I been sick for nearly over a week now. So I just go on campus coughing \ud83d\ude03 so I don\u2019t effect my grade thanks professor tucker",

If CPP had more things in a walkable distance like late hour hangout spots, restaurants, cafes, etc. nearby then that'd dramatically change the social environment.\n\nLa Verne and the Claremont colleges are nearby and are more social partly because of that. Now that I remember, the lanterman site was supposed to be redeveloped for that purpose, but idk what's come of that so far.\n\nI agree, I don't think UCLA or USC are a fair comparison, as stereotypical flagship schools ofc there going to have way more things going on",

I too had this mindset about the school until I put myself out there and started to socialize\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard here to find a social scene and everyone who thinks it\u2019s hard aren\u2019t trying enough",

To plainly put it, if you're looking for the stereotypical or advertised college experience CPP isn't really the place for that.",

Sorry for your loss, but I had fun and I know many others who have too. Like i said, you just gotta go out there and look for it. Seems like it\u2019s a lot harder for others",

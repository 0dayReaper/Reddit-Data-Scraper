    "postText": "Im currently majoring in Chemical Engineer, along with our easy materials minor that only requires one more class. I have been thinking about also minoring in either Chemistry or Computer Science, more so leaning towards CS. \n\nAre there any engineers out there that would recommend not minoring in CS, or have any information that would be helpful in making this decision? Any information on both those two minors will be greatly appreciated\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nGood luck on Finals!",

            "comment": "I'm obviously biased being an EE, but I would say that knowing your way around programming/scripting in general can't hurt you, but going out of your way to get a specific minor for it may not be worth it. You'll be trying to get classes in another impacted major while trying to avoid lengthening your time to graduation. Your time might be better spent on a programming-adjacent project so that you can still put it as a skillset on your resume without tying yourself down for an extra semester or whatnot.",

ChE only code to make our life easier so that should be something you learn on the side. I recommend Dr. Ucar senior project if you want to learn Python. VBA is something you can also look into when you are out working to make your work flow faster",

I stand at a 3.4 which I need to boost up, but I know I am not the best student but hey it's worth a try for my last year of college.",

However I\u2019m not sure where you can at this point with commencement being so close. It\u2019s definitely worth calling and nagging about.\n\nEdit: https://www.cpp.edu/commencement/graduates-information/honorcord-diploma.shtml",

I've taken many summer semesters and the summer semesters where I was a full time student (12 units), I only paid like 300 bucks max. \n\nHowever, in the summer semesters where I took 2 classes (about 6 units), I paid like 1300 bucks. For this reason, I did at one point take 2 easy bullshit courses to be considered a full time student and not pay as much but it is risky if you're taking more difficult courses or want to work during the summer.",

Summer aid is much less than the regular school year, not sure about everyone but I think if you are part time for summer so less than 6 units? You get around 600 and if you\u2019re more than 6units?(full time I guess) you get double that. But more than likely you will be paying out of pocket",

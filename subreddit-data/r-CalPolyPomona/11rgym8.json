            "comment": "Civil engineering is a solid major. You can go into environmental, structural, transportation, heavy civil, or water resources. You can work for a city, county, state, federal, or even the military which are very stable jobs with good pay and great benefits and you get pension after x years depending on the employer\u2019s retirement plan. Or you can go into consulting in a large company where the work load is heavy, timed on every task, under stress, constant deadlines that require working late and weekends with little to no overtime, but that depends on the firm. Many engineering companies in general don\u2019t give Overtime or pensions anymore. You make more in a private civil firm, but lack work life balance. Also, if work gets slow, the company can\u2019t win projects, or you\u2019re not producing at the rate they want they fire you. I\u2019ve even heard of people quitting companies since their scared they\u2019ll get fired as a precaution once a major project ends. However, working in private companies does supercharge your resume for future jobs. Since you typically do much more things than in public. I worked several private jobs before landing a public position.",

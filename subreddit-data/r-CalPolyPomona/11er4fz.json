    "postText": "So I got out of class at around 2:30pm and at the intersection of Kellogg and S. Campus I saw this white dude pointed a gun at this Mexican guy. I was like what the fuck, so then the white dude was telling the Mexican guy to back up until the Mexican guy went around the white dudes car. Then the white guy threw the gun as far as he can, went back in his car and took off. And the Mexican dude tried to find the gun picked it up and started walking away. The Mexican dude was wearing a pirates hat and a hoodie I think he was trying to rob the white dude but got the gun taken away.",

Second my life wasn\u2019t in danger HIS life was, point blank the gun was aimed at him. And I couldn\u2019t just drive off the intersection was busy and that could\u2019ve caused a crash, you don\u2019t panic in a situation like this u remain calm. Third I didn\u2019t call the police when I was at a safe location my house. Lastly reddit is the exact place to post stuff like this, especially when it deals with the school and the recent spike of crime around campus. Anything else you want to add?",

This is the most likely scenario... and I've actually seen it happen before tbh (thankfully not around CPP though lol). Person with the gun gets a bit too close and is quickly disarmed by the intended \"victim\". I can't think of any other reason why someone would yeet a gun like that and not care who picks it up afterwards.\n\nEdit: UPD caught the suspect shortly after this incident. It was indeed an unsuccessful robbery attempt.",

Some of the scenarios are: \n1) the paisa borrowed the gun from one of his older homies to to a quick \u201cjale\u201d and was too scared to go back without it because the beating he was going to get was going to be brutal. \n2) That gun (if the scenario is true) was used in other jobs so he\u2019s scared to leave it behind. Evidence \n3) is the paisa was not alone, that was probably his way of earning a stripe for the gang to be allowed to tattoo the hood on himself. Tattoos are earned not given surprisingly \n4) he\u2019s probably just a dumb ass wannabe trying to press some guy.\n\nIf he was a cholo he\u2019s from SSP 13( South side Pomona) most likely in my opinion. They are very active and have tons of young members. WSP (West side Pomona) or HTP ( Happy town Pomona)\nRemember everyone the cholos of the past are no longer a thing. The young thugs are the ones running the show now in the streets",

    "postText": "A couple of friends and I were taking exit 42a onto Kellogg Drive at 9pm and we saw a car stopped at the off-ramp turning left. We were slowing to a stop to turn right when a man exited from the driver\u2019s side door and started running at us, and we quickly accelerated and headed towards the dorms. \n\nHe was in a 2012 Jeep Renegade, middle aged and was holding a white balloon when he got out of the car. We were really freaked out and had no idea what to do, so we just kept driving. He had been stopped at the off-ramp before we drove up beside him, and his emergency lights weren\u2019t on, just his brake lights. It looked like he was shouting something but there were multiple people and none of us could hear him. \n\nWe wanted to post this here to see if anyone had experienced anything like that, and to warn anyone who might see the same thing.",

Also saw another car, a black sedan, with his hazards on slowly driving on the side of the freeway toward the exit. I wonder if they had something to do with each other?",

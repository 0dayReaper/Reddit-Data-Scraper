    "postText": "I got accepted into two engineering schools: Cal Poly Pomona and Oxford University. I'm having trouble deciding which one to choose. CPP is only 20 minutes away from home, offers a hands-on learning experience, while Oxford is located thousands of miles away and has a reputed global status.\n\nI'm looking for advice from anyone who has experience with either school or can offer insights that can help me make an informed decision.\n\n&gt;!EDIT: I\u2019m loving how most of you didn\u2019t see the flair!&lt;",

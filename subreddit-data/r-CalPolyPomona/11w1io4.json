    "postText": "I got accepted into Cal Poly Pomona as a music major; however, I want to change my major to business administration. I plan on taking GE classes in my first semester while talking to Academic advisors about switching majors. I have no experience in this type of situation, so I just wanted to make this post for the purpose of seeking guidance.\n\nWhat is the procedure for changing majors in Pomona? Is it hard and time-consuming? Will it be possible to transfer?",

For impacted majors, it takes longer to get accepted but as long as you meet the requirements, you shouldn\u2019t worry too much :)",

    "postText": "There's zero barriers  and literally anyone can enter whenever they want. There's loads of places to sit or lounge in nice AC (the entire BSC, all six floors of the library, the bookstore). Even if you're dirty or bedraggled, there isn't a single employee who is going to potentially risk telling a student to leave just because of their appearance. There's so many people that nobody is going to remember you or even notice you. And even on the off chance that you got kicked out of a building, you can just go to another one, or lay down outside worst-case. They have no right to kick you out, and it would sure beat hanging out on a sidewalk near a busy street. Always wondered why those guys who sleep at the bus stops don't just go to the campus.",

Most of the unhoused population is invisible because they are still relatively functionally.  One of my favorite students lived in her car in the parking lots for a semester with her two kids until she could afford a deposit for rent.  The highly visible unhoused population is the group struggling the most, with addiction, with mental instability, with a host of challenges.  So the short answer is, there are lots of unhoused people on campus and it's a travesty and we are failing as a society.",

I\u2019ve been around many different homeless people. Some are the nicest people and some will literally punch you in the face as your walking by(happened to a friend).

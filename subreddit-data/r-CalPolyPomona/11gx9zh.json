    "postText": "Hey all, little bit of confusion here. \n\nSo I got accepted for for fall 2023 for my major at CPP as a transfer. Super happy of course, and I sent over my official transcripts. However, on ASSIST.ORG, it says a certain math class is required on the agreement. I\u2019m in that math class right now and there let\u2019s say isn\u2019t a 100% chance I can pass it. \n\nOn my acceptance letter it didn\u2019t say anything about it being conditional (besides sending my transcripts through fall). If I fail that class, will my admission be revoked? I looked online and couldn\u2019t find anything, but it wasn\u2019t clear or definitive. Just curious so I know how set myself a safety net with the schools I applied too. Thank you!",

You will remain as provisionally admitted until your final high school transcript is received and reviewed for admission requirements. Provisionally admitted students still move forward with other enrollment activities such as orientation and course registration.\u201d",

Anyways, I think I\u2019ll just reach out to admissions to ask the question.",

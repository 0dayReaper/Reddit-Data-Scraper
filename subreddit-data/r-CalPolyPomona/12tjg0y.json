    "postText": "Just a heads up from a CPP alumni. Several departments in the city of LA are recruiting pretty heavily, and its a decent opportunity for new grads to get into positions with strong benefits and good work/life balance. E.g., LADWP has a dozen or so classes of positions opening for civil service in the next 3-6 months, including engineering associate and systems programmer positions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-careers](https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-careers)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're graduating between now and December, look into either open recruiting applications on Handshake or through the career links for the above or similar city departments. Hope it helps anyone who is actively searching.",

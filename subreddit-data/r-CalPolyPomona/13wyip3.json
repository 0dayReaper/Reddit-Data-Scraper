    "postText": "I'm currently a cc student and plan to transfer to CPP for either Spring or Fall 2024. I am planning to major in Business - management and HR concentration and hope to get hands on experience in this field. For those attending or graduated, do you like CPP and what is your advice for me? I've read some other reddit posts about CPP already but thought to make a post myself to see what else I can get. Thanks!  \n\nInformation about the student life, the people, the vibes, surrounding area, etc., can be mentioned. I heard it's a commuter school and that it's hard to make friends, but I'm social enough to speak out first if I want to make connections. \n\nadditional note: I'm also considering CSUF and CSULB for business, but Pomona I heard is the best but I'm still not sure if it's the best choice for me. I don't mind if a school is not a party school. I care more about the people attending and whether or not they have good vibes and if I can make some long-time friends.",

When you get to your upper division classes I highly recommend you meet some people in those classes because they may show up again in a future class.  \nCPP is indeed a commuter school, but upper division classes tend to be more hands on and also a lot of group work so you may use that to socialize with other students. They may have similar mindsets and careers with you so it's good to try and know some of them.   \nIn terms of which school is better in terms of business, CSUF is probably better, but CPP and CSULB still have solid programs in business. Depends what you want, maybe it's more convenient for you to commute to a school that's closer, maybe you feel CSUF would provide the most value.\n\nFrom my experience as a transfer student as well, I definitely have learned a lot of hands on material and apply it to real life situations, so the content I learned is pretty applicable and useful. I'm not even a sociable person and I've met friends going into real estate, banking, accounting, and other fields. I've had a handful of good professors and a handful of bad professors, a lot of it to me was self-study, but a lot of it was hands-on useful skills/information. I think the business program here is pretty solid, but I can't say for CSUF so gl.",

My gf's friend is in the business club and they hang out frequently, if this interest you. The surrounding area isn't much, but if you are willing to drive then that would solve most of it. Just know that it's only a few food places, thats really it. Overall, most students stick to themselves and come to campus only for classes, not really for fun or to make friends. This is the main reason why Cal Poly isn't very social.",

I will say though if you want a college social life it\u2019s easy to get if you just involve yourself on campus with clubs or maybe business fraternities if typical Greek life isn\u2019t for you. I\u2019ve met some of my best friends at CPP and something that is nice about CPP is that it is secluded from the rest of the area so you never feel like you\u2019re just in a campus in the middle of a suburb and there are still plenty of people that are not from the general area like myself.",

And for being knows as an agriculture school the animal science lab rooms were absolutely embarrassing to be in. I would even argue that the chemistry labs were even so outdated....the buildings are old. The elevators hardly work. I don't really see is as being very accessible friendly. \nI will say that the view is beautiful. The mountains are beautiful. But honestly that's about it....",

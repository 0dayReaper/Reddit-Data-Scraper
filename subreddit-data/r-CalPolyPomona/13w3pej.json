I'm not sure if EMSET has its own social club, but I'm sure ASME(American society of Mechanical Engineers) would be happy to have you. Pop by the club fair at the beginning of the year to find more.\n\nThe first career fair is very early, have professional attire ready(or there is a place on campus to get professional attire free, the name of it slips my mind) and have a resume ready(it can be light, it'll be expected of a freshman to have a mostly empty resume, it's more about networking and getting your name out the first year than actually finding an internship). Go into the career center for help on the resume, even if you feel like you know it. They also have interview practice.\n\nIf you feel you're behind in classes, MEP offers free tutoring from 9 to 5 for everyone. The room is in the walkway underneath building 9, if you go there you'll see it. I'm not gonna put his name on blast, but last year there was an EMSET major who was a really good tutor, he'd be able to give you advice on classes and proffesors.\n\nThis was everything I wish I got told last year, hope it helps!\n\nAlso, if you're looking to transfer do it early, and join AIAA to see what an Aero typically does, theyre a socialish club, less active than ASME but they do cool stuff too, and have their own associated project.",

College isnt that hard, if its not a major course then D's get degrees... trust me I know that first hand. Take care of your health and be in contact with your family, you'll be surprised how fast everyone will age. Try to limit the debt you take on and apply for financial aid every single year. Don't be a dick to professors, you'll be suprised how much leeway you'll be given if you just show up every class and participate. Professors are people too, they don't want to stare and talk to people just browsing reddit on their phones/laptops.",

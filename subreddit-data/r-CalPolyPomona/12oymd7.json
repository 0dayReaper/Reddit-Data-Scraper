I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the most outgoing so I\u2019m worried about how hard it might be to make friends as a freshman.",

            "comment": "Here's the deal and it really is that simple. Pretty much every CSU is designed for transfer students - people who commute. As in people who show up to class, for class, and then leave after class.  It's an end justifies the means kind of place. And it does it well. Think of it as someone who says \"I need a car to get to work and cheap\" and ends up with a 20 year old sentra that, surprise surprise, drives ok but that's about it.\n\nUC, most privates, and other big public universities that have like 20,000 students living on campus are a different feel, serve a different purpose, and have a different student body. These are the ones that you will have random soccer games in the middle of the quad at 10:43 pm on a tuesday night, beer runs with your buddy only to wake up 6 min before your 2pm class and still show up on time. From that car analogy, it would be like financing a brand new car with all the bells and whistles.\n\nWhichever one you choose, so be it. But let's not pretend there is some secret hack here of getting a $50,000 new car experience on a $6,000 budget... it is what it is.",

I spent years just by myself enjoying my free time, and people just respect my privacy and don\u2019t talk to me. And the last couple years, i attended club meetings, social events, workshops, talked to vendors, volunteered and made a lot of friends along the way. You don\u2019t have to do what I do, but check out mybar and just see if there\u2019s any fun events that interest you. People are incredibly friendly. You just have to put yourself out there.\n\nEdit: these events don\u2019t have to be super serious either btw. Not like a job fair or essay workshop (unless you want to attend those). just a couple days ago, I went to a basket weaving workshop and then a fun painting event to relax. We just ate bagels and drank coffee lol",

I\u2019ve been a student at CPP for 2 years and been living at the uni village since earlier this year, and it seems that there are plenty of clubs to join depending on your particular interests, and also many frats/sororities if you\u2019re into Greek life.  I feel that the hardest part about making new friends (in any school for this matter) is putting yourself out there and just simply talking to people. It\u2019s tough at first, but you\u2019ll get hang of it once you start connecting with people that have similar interests as you. :)",

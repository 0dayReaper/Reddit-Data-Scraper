If anyone can let me know how their architecture program is from experience. I am trying to make a decision which college I should go to. Thanks",

            "comment": "Architecture grad here.  It's a very broad question.  Have you done some basic research?  There's a lot of info here on reddit.  CPP is well regarded for architecture.  What are your other choices?  In a nut shell, CPP ARC is one of only two public, professionally accredited public undergraduate programs in California.  Since the state is larger in population than most countries, you can imagine there's a lot of demand for the program.  You should consider yourself lucky to have one of the slots.  As far as CP SLO, it similar in that if emphasizes practical things like construction and engineering, but it differs in that it's within LA County, which is a hot bed of designer architecture.  In fact, many of the instructors are practicing architects with some very good design work.  The program is influenced by it's history going back to modern mid-century architecture.  The school owns the internationally famous VDL house designed by Richard Neutra, who once taught and left a huuuge imprint on the program.  That's basically it.  Please look up previous posts here on reddit.",

I liked my time at Pomona, but I would have seriously considered those two.  Berkeley is not a professional program and you will only study architecture for 2 of those years.  The expect that their students would continue their studies with Masters of Architecture.  Like I mentioned, SLO is similar in some ways to Pomona, but from what I can tell by their faculty and colleagues that went there, they have less emphasis in design if that's what you're into.  Like Berkeley that is hard to pass up for prestige, SLO is hard to pass up for the college town and the beach.  Woodbury on the other hand is private but no better than the Cal Polys.  It doesn't really feel like a university either.  Hope that helps.",

CPP SLO being in the middle of nowhere has traditionally had faculty that all they did was teach as opposed to actually practice while most Pomona profs have practices themselves or work at established LA firms.  That's my understanding from having worked with alums from both schools for decades.",

I did my own research, and that's why I applied to them. I have done the basic research and talked to some schools when applying. I just didn't really go too deep in research on each school to be honest, but I did get an idea of what each school specializes more. I came here to know what alumni might say about the program at cal poly pomona.",

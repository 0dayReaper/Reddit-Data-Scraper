    "postText": "Hi! So for context I'm a 2nd year student and I only became declared at the start of my 2nd year but I've only taken three CIS classes (CIS 1010, CIS 2100, and CIS 2650) at this point.\n\nI've leaned into the Information Security and Forensics Career Track but besides taking more classes, I'm not exactly sure how to get more general experiences as I'm kind of new to this whole field.\n\nI've heard getting internships is key but with my current experience I doubt I could get anything meaningful.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is what classes should I look into getting and what can I do to improve my overall knowledge when it comes to CIS, such as where to find real-world experience (jobs/internships and such)\n\nAny advice is appreciated and thanks again!",

I downloaded a game that turned out to be a bootkit virus, it corrupted the master boot record (MBR) of my hard drive which made the PC unable to boot, and I lost all my files. I spent the next few months trying to get my files back and learned a ton in the process.\n\nThe very first step for anything is just finding inspiration. You don't have to brick your PC for this. You can read technical articles, watch videos, talk to technical people, and just expose yourself to the field (preferably while keeping your clothes on). The goal is to find things that interest you and make you a bit curious. If you're into cybersecurity [check out my multi-reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/user/willbo/m/tech/)\n\nFrom there you can start building projects to learn more about things that interest you. The great thing about tech is you can get experience outside of school or a job and it doesn't require a large investment. Interested in cloud? Start a free Azure or AWS account and spin up some virtual machines (free credits for students). Interested in code? Clone some free and opensource projects from Github. Interested in networks? Log into your router's admin page and dive into the config (after a backup of course).\n\nAfter my encounter with the bootkit virus I started tinkering with other projects like trying to make my internet faster on my router, trying different antiviruses, inspecting malicious code, and resolving other tech issues. You will get stuck many many times, but just persevere. I ended up putting that experience on my resume and snowballing my career from there.",

            "comment": "First of all you're incredibly normal in your situation since it's incredibly hard to get internships and jobs. There's currently a tech freeze thats harmed a lot of students' chances and it's important to buckle down in what you can get to boost your resume. My recommendation is to look into projects, such as playing in tryhackme, building a homelab, etc. Maybe join a club and try everything. You don't need to be good at it, just try it. \n\nI had very little experience when I came into CPP so I ended up joining FAST since I felt they were very open and friendly. I have a lot of gripes with the base curriculum that the CIS department provides so I feel that clubs are the next best option just to learn things. It's important to put yourself out there \n\nAnyways here's the cybersecurity club discord \n\nhttps://discord.gg/EMVwvYZwua",

            "comment": "First internship is always the hardest to get, keep applying. In your free time, try working a side job like librarian, program assistant, etc. Any work experience is better than none, cause you\u2019ll look lazy if you have only coursework and your degree listed. Add your projects, make a LinkedIn, and a portfolio link (GitHub/Wordpress) onto your resume to fill in space. Also remember that internships don\u2019t come to those who are lucky, they come to people who relentlessly apply (unless you have some insane connections). Good luck.",

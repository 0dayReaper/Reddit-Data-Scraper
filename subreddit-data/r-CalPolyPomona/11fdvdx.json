    "postText": "I want to pursue careers, such as Software Development and Web Development. \n\nI was planning on majoring in Computer Science since it\u2019s the most popular route. However, there are a lot of math classes and physics. I\u2019m not a fan of theory, but would it be information that\u2019s important for me to know? \n\nI\u2019ve looked into Computer Information Science, which seems to be a lot easier and has more specific classes for App Development. \n\nBut, I\u2019m not sure if a Computer Information Science degree would put me at a disadvantage when looking for a job or internship. \n\nI\u2019m conflicted because I don\u2019t want to take random science classes, but I also am not into business classes. I know data structures and algorithms are important for technical interviews and I want to make sure I am well prepared for the real world after college \n\nPlease give me your thoughts and suggestions. Thanks! If there anymore details you need to know, let me know.",

From my experience with CS in 2015, only 1 professor ever worked in the industry.\n\nI work as a Data Analyst/Database admin now, but a lot of it was due to me learning as an intern. My CS degree maybe helped me in figuring out what's best practice for coding, and how to do logical problem solving, but otherwise it hasn't really taught me much for my job that I couldn't learn from working as an intern.\n\nBut yeah, whatever path you chose, work experience/interning is just as important, if not even more than your degree itself.",

I don't know firsthand; it's just a logical assumption. If you want, you can go on the CPP SWIFT Discord server and ask there, since most everyone there is CS or CIS. Honestly though, I think a lot of it boils down to \"You can teach a CS major CIS, but not vice versa.\"",

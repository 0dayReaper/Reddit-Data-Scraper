I will say that out of everything, being a part of SWIFT and trying to self-study helped tremendously. \n\nI remember thinking there was no way I could land an internship. I knew nothing compared to those around me yet I landed two. Sooooo it seems to have worked out lol. Keep applying and furthering your skill set.",

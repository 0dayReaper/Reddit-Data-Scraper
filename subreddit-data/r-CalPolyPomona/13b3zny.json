    "postText": "Hello, I just got off the waitlist and am accepted to the computer science program. However, I am worried for one class that I\u2019m currently taking which is data structures and program design. If I have all my other classes, golden 4, and over 60 transfer units, would I still be accepted or will failing that one class screw me over? Can\u2019t I retake it over at CPP if I were to fail?",

            "comment": "Hello! \n\nData Structures is not a required course for admissions. For CIS, we are looking for the completion of 60 transferable units, the golden four, required supplemental courses (these can be found on our website: [https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/impacted-majors.shtml](https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/impacted-majors.shtml)) and that your GPA doesn't fall too below the GPA you were admitted with. \n\nOur office will conduct a final evaluation in the summer once we receive final transcripts. \n\nThank You, \n\nOffice of Admissions - Cal Poly Pomona",

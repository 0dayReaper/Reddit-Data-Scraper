All my friends that I know went there hated it after the first semester. Pomona is no paradise but the area around it is nice and you are driving distance to a lot of cool shit. You have to remember that you will be living in Reno for the next 4 years if you go. All my friends hated it after they went back to their second year on. And not that CPP is MIT but there is most definitely a reason UNR has an acceptance rate of almost 90%. The business school has probably the best building on campus and it\u2019s fairly well ranked",

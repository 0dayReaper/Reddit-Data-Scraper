    "postText": "Welp, after 6.5 years (finished this past December) I am finally graduating with a B.S in FRL. \n\nI regretted going to college when I first started but now that I am graduating I can actually say that my degree in finance was completely worth it and has opened up a lot of opportunities to me. I have an accounting position for a rapidly growing civil engineering/geology company on salary. \n\nOne thing for sure I\u2019ve learned after wanting to drop out of college about 3-4 times is to never give up. Shit is gonna get hard and sometimes I felt like a failure in my classes but there are going to be those times where you feel so achieved and it motivates you to just keep your head up.\n\nThis is a huge achievement for me as a 1st generation college grad in my family. I was a full time student and full time employee at the same time for 4 out of those 6 years.\n\nOh yeah one more thing. Fuck coley",

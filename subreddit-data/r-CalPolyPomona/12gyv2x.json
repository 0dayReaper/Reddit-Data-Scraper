    "postText": "Hi all cpp is one of my top choices and have been thinking of going this fall. I constantly see people saying this school is really good for engineering and that it prepares you for the workforce really well. How does cpp do this? Are there special classes, opportunities, internships, etc. that lead to this. I got in for industrial engineering if that helps in providing an answer. Thank you for reading.",

            "comment": "I did a TON of research on this topic. I visited every school in Southern California to get a feel for the schools. Luckily, I know some people who work in the space and defense industry and connected with them (one in management and a few others who are engineers). These were 30 minute long conversations, where I was picking their brains apart.\n\nI asked them about the dilemma I was having between choosing CPP and other UC\u2019s I got accepted into. It boiled down to this: if you want to get into research then go to a UC, but if you are looking to work after school then go to a Polytechnic University if possible. SLO and CPP are highly regarded schools for engineering. Employers know that when they hire engineers from these schools the majority of their students will be ready to work with little training required.\n\nI also checked out u/PaulNissenson podcast and listened to pretty much every episode. My big takeaway after listening to some Professors on the podcast was to go to CPP to for Undergrad, and a Master\u2019s at a UC after. \n\nOn top of that, I checked out the engineering curriculum offered at a lot of these other schools and was disappointed with how theory focused they are. CPP\u2019s curriculum for engineering was much more impressive imo, and seemed more interesting because of the amount of labs you get on top of the theory. Don\u2019t believe me? Go check out the curriculums.\n\nEven then, I still had to be sure. I went to check out CPP last week and was very impressed with their college of engineering. They take a lot of pride in their engineering department. Don\u2019t believe me? Go check it out. I\u2019ll also be attending their open house next weekend to learn more about the school.\n\nI\u2019d like to add I have two friends who are doing electrical engineering at CPP and another at USC. I\u2019ve been a lot more impressed with the work my friends at CPP are doing than the one at USC. When they say hands on they really mean it.\n\nI hope this helps in some way. I start in Fall 2023 for Aerospace Engineering and I\u2019m really excited to start!",

The only other thing I would add is the class size. If you attend a UC, expect most classes to be 100+ students. At CPP, engineering class sizes are \\~30-35 and you have a much better opportunity to get to know faculty.",

Thanks for the info on the class sizes, that is one of my biggest deciding factors. My other option is an oos private with very small class sizes, so hearing that cpp has similar if a little bigger class sizes is a huge plus to me.",

Also that podcast looks lit i had no idea of its existence. I am also attending the open house this Saturday, have not visited the campus ever but checked out the virtual tour. Lmk if you want to meet up lol, i know that might be kinda weird so I understand if you are hesitant, just want to meet new people. Congrats on aerospace!",

Some of the weed-out classes are physics for some people \ud83e\udee4or Diff Equations.\nI saw people fail Statics and that's considered one of the easier core Engineering classes. In my opinion it's all a mindset. If you're determined you'll figure out a way for every course that's considered difficult and tedious.",

Cal Poly are polytechnic university so it's more hands on, more lab while other school is more theory research and stuff. CPP tuition is little than 4000 a semester so it's definitely cheaper so u don't regret having thousands of dollar in loan after school.",

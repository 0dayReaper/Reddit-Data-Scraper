    "postText": "I\u2019m in the middle of deciding on which school to transfer to. A little bit about me, I am a biology major working towards getting into medical school. I am overwhelmed by my current studies and trying to finish my last semester strong before transferring so I don\u2019t know what I should do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nQuestion to people on the same boat, how important is it to save as much money if you have plans to attend such an expensive place such as medical school. \n\nThe cost of attendance between UCSB &amp; Cal Poly Pomona differ of an amount of $7,000 just by tuiton itself. Attending UCSB, will be having to pay for room and board, while attending Cal Poly Pomona, I will only have to worry about tuition cost. \n\nMy overall focus on going to a school that will be the best for my major. I am 100% committed to this career path, so which one is the best?",

            "comment": "Interestingly enough I attended UCSB for my undergrad and now I\u2019m finishing up my Graduate degree at CPP. \n\nCPP is a commuter school and it\u2019s way harder to make relationships with people, professors, etc. While UCSB is a closer knit community where like 90% of the students walk/bike to campus. Parties almost every night if your are into that. \n\nHousing is definitely the worst part of UCSB. But as a transfer I think you are guaranteed housing with the UCSB apartments (~$600-700 utilities included) your first year and after you make some friends you\u2019ll likely won\u2019t have too hard of a time finding a spot for your senior year. \n\nPersonally I think it was worth it to attend UCSB. Nothing beats getting out of class and being a stones throw away from the beach. I don\u2019t really care about making connections and all that now since I have a job now, but maybe that\u2019s something you want to consider. \n\nBoth campuses are diverse, both campuses are well know, at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter where your bachelors comes from, as long as you have the grades and letters of recommendation. Finically CPP is the better choice. However the UCSB campus lifestyle is miles ahead of CPP.",

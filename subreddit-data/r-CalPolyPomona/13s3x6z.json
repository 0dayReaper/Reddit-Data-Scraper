Hope to hear your replies soon.",

Professor Leong is nice and informational. Dr Zhao had an amazing class for stem cell, one of my favorite classes I've taken. Not biology directly but needed for major; idk if she teaches still but Svetlana Stouklova did physics 1 and one of my favorite teachers to date. Really going on rate my professor is *mostly* accurate, but remember the negatives are mostly angry people so it's not always as awful as it really is.",

I think you should be asking which classes you should take? \n\nI wish I still could log in and see who\u2019s teaching what, but I really don\u2019t have any complaints about the biosci faculty. They\u2019re all really great and helpful.",

I have seen a lot of my friends conduct research projects on the side and I wondered for a while if I should do the same, but I never found the time or the interest. I sort of regret not doing some kind of research on something I found interesting. Anyone else feel this way?",

I then realized that I don't like Psych research and it doesn't really matter for what I plan to do. \n\nLike others have said here, it only matters for certain majors and if you want to go to grad school or not.",

But for future people, yes faculty is all majors push for you to do applicable \"research\" or internships so that your work experience builds in school rather than after. That way you are a more competitive option for employers. It's only getting more important to have experience before graduating but luckily cop is considered a hands on school so you can say you got the experience still.",

That's about 10 refuels a month, (ignoring that you only go to campus 4-5 days of the week depending on your schedule). So let's be generous and overestimate with say $600-$700 on gas a month. More if you have a van, SUV, or truck. Or considerably less if you drive electric.\n\nAt about $600-$700 a month, you can literally just about rent a room nearby. Realistically maybe $800-$900, but it would be cheaper than dorming. Then maybe $300 for groceries and food a month. \n\nStill cheaper than the cheapest dorm option of a triple for 5k per semester (4 months) with no meals. The only downside being that renting a room instead of a dorm means paying rent EVEN during summer and winter breaks, when you might decide to return to your parents house to live. \n\nI'd say, do the math, see if you can afford dorming or renting a room, and go from there. Perhaps your parents will have a better picture once the numbers are crunched  and make it easier to decide. \n\nAlso living alone, I've been doing that practically since high school due to circumstances. I think it forces you to learn a lot in terms of responsibility, taking care of yourself, cooking, and cleaning after yourself. It's not a bad experience.",

If it\u2019s your first year, I would say to dorm or find a roommate and experience college to the fullest. You\u2019ll never get the time back and it\u2019s a great experience to live away from home. Gas gets costly and not to mention the wear and tear on your car.",

The drive ranged from 1.5-2 hrs depending on traffic.The first 3 semesters , 1.5 years, was the hardest because I was going to school everyday. Towards the second half of my time at cpp, it was easier to get my upper division engineering classes , so I was able to cram everything down to 2-3 days. It\u2019s doable, but most my days started at 4-5 am and I didn\u2019t get home till 9-10 and repeat lol",

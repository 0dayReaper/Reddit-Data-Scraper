    "postText": "I got into CPP for MechE but at my current community college lets say I may not pass a certain math class. Based on the Impacted Majors website of CPP it says this math class is not required for transfer but I've heard a lot about GPA. As of now I know my GPA will be well within 3.0 and above. Anyone have any advice of what to do or expect? ",

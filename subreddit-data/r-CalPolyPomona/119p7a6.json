Same with the lab if anything, the lab is really hurting me right now. I do tutoring at least twice a week (so I'm not completely lost)\n\nI just seem to fall behind on studying and hw bc of other classes + work.",

A tutor can be incredibly knowledgeable, but may not know the exact material the professor considers important. You may be focusing on the details that don\u2019t matter to your professor and the excess details can make your learning experience overwhelming.",

            "comment": "There is financial aid over the summer in the form of Pell grant and/or calgrant. To my understanding it is guaranteed as long as you receive one of the two grants during the semester AND you take a minimum of 6 units for 50% of 12 units for 100% of the aid you typically receive any given semester. To be considered for the calgrant you must fill out [this form](https://www.cpp.edu/financial-aid/forms/summer_cal_grant_request_2023_fillable.pdf) and email it to finaid@cpp.edu. \n\nDisclaimer: Confirm this info with the finaid office, I'm just a student relaying information to the best of my understanding.\n\nEDIT: Winter however, is indeed out of pocket",

I am trying to estimate the cost (I am still trying to decide what college to go to) and I have heard from several people that it took them more than 4 years to complete.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13255no)",

Your better off going to a cheaper CSU school and getting a summer internship somewhere. All those schools will be ABET accredited so it does not matter and they have just amount of \"hands-on\" labs as SLO or CPP. Some may even SLO and CPP have labs that are a waste of time. \n\nBottom line, minimize your debt and get an internship.\n\nCalifornia has failed it's universities.",

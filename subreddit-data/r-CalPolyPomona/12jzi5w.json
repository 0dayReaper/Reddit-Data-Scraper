    "postText": "So I'm currently a ME major. Found out I absolutely hate physics after taking PHY 1210. Can't imagine doing physics for the rest of my life. \n\nSo I decided to make a reasonable change and try to get into the College of Science to be a computer science major. I believe CS and ME is a impacted major. Does switching from impacted to impacted major help my chances? Do they generally accept change in majors? \n\nAny feedback is appreciated, thanks.",

At least if you were in USC or something the frats are cooler dudebros with their own houses. Over here they're just pathetic losers. If you're thinking of joining one, please use your money as toilet paper and then flush it. Much better use of your money.",

Most of the greek life I saw through people I know was just the sororities going to parties at ucla and other schools while the frats mostly just smoked and drank on or off campus, it gets old real fast if you're getting invited to them",

I got 3 bids in fall but turned them down not because of the frats, I was just busy as engineer. A lot of frat dudes suck but its not as bad as people like him make them out to be",

Most of not all the social frats on campus have a house and they do normal Greek life events including parties. The sororities are also fairly big in numbers. Yeah it\u2019s not USC but it\u2019s also not too bad at all",

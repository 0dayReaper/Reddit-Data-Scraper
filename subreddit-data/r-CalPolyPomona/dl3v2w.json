When I opened the door to see what was going on, I saw a family of ducks (mom + dozen ducklings) quacking away. A few ducklings quickly scurried into the house and ran into various rooms. Even though it only took a couple minutes to catch them all, they left SO MUCH CRAP all over the house. In the kitchen, in the living room, in the hallway, in a bedroom... it was everywhere. So whenever I see ducks nowadays I think of them as incredible crapping machines. \n\nIn short, I have a very low opinion of ducks.",

    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was recently offered a position for an internship in the marketing field and going to move forward with the opportunity. I am a business administration major with a focus on FRL (finance). I know that CPP offers unit credits for internships but am not sure if I will be able to get credit for it as \"FRL 4411\" since it is a marketing-focused internship. Does anyone know if it would qualify?",

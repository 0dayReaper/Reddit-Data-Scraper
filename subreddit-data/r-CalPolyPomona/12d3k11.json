It\u2019s a summer program for incoming students to get a head start on their Math and Ethnic Studies courses before the start of their first year, and it\u2019s free, from the classes, room and board, food; everything. You have to dorm for roughly 6 weeks and it\u2019s basically like an intro guide leading into your first term. There\u2019s more info on their website, you can check it out right here:\n\n[https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/bronco-scholars/index.shtml](https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/bronco-scholars/index.shtml)",

    "postText": "Hi all,\nI'm a current HS senior trying to decide whether or not CPP is right for me.\n\nI was accepted for my first choice major of Electrical Engineering, but I am currently very active in music and hope to remain active in music (mainly jazz). I am considering double majoring as well.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts on how the music program is at CPP, I'd love to hear them!\n\nI'm currently weighing CPP against CSULB, and while CSULB is very well known for its jazz at the Bob Cole Conservatory, CPP remains a top contender for me because if its superior engineering education.\n\nThank you!",

On the other hand you\u2019ll probably get more out of the CSULB music program than at CPP. So choose the one you want to do more!",

I\u2019m wondering if this might be too much work to handle in one session.\n\nI would appreciate if anyone could share their experience taking PLS 2010 (and with which professor)\n\nI\u2019m planning on taking it with Jarred Cuellar",

You were told to read the textbook but I passed with an A- without reading it and just using control-F on the final.\n\nI\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t hard, just a little annoying with the busy work required. Especially with the essay that you were required to write, but he graded it nicely as I didn\u2019t even finish it, didn\u2019t cite my sources, and got a 70%. I was able to smash out a whole week\u2019s worth of assignments (they were due every Monday I believe) in 4 hrs, and I did that weekly and was fine.",

There's no need for anyone to pass judgment until the facts come out at trial (if it isn't settled out of court).\n\n(This next comment has nothing to do with the lawsuit.)   \nA lot of people like to blame university administrators for the university's problems. However, as I've interacted with university administrators over the years, it is my impression that (for the most part) they are doing the best they can given the limited resources and limited options available to them. Most students (and many faculty) are totally unaware about how the university budget works, the laws that the university must follow, and other constraints. Additionally, many positive actions by administrators are unknown to students and faculty because they aren't publicized. For example, during 3-5pm today I will be in a committee meeting discussing potential university policies with faculty from across campus and a high-level administrator. All the faculty on that committee are volunteers, and we do this work because we want to make CPP a better place for everyone. Across campus, there are tons of committees with faculty and administrators (and sometimes students) who are working hard behind the scenes to make this small city work. \n\nSo, I haven't become disillusioned over the years. Rather, I have become more aware of the constraints that administrators and faculty must consider when making decisions.",

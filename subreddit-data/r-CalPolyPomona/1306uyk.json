    "postText": "Hey guys I got accepted into Electrical Engineering for next semester but I might not pass my circuits analysis class I have trying to find a school that might have it over the summer but have had no luck. I have called admissions and I was told pretty much nothing other than it was a part of my requirements. Any advice you guys can give me or point me into a specific direction of who to contact and if I do fail and what would happen to my admission status ?",

            "comment": "I am not admissions but what I was told that I just needed to complete the golden 4, 60 units credit, and the supplemental classes or required classes to transfer. I transferred for EE and got accepted in 2021. I even dropped my last classes which I stated that I would take before i transferred. I didnt even take circuit analysis class and got accepted. I would say do your best in the class as some prof curves the grading. But again, I would say to ask them to transfer you to someone else from the admission and see if they all have the same answer. Additionally check and search \u201ccpp transfer requirement\u201d and find the classes required. Those are the classes they look and care about admission from my understanding. Again, I am not admissions but that is my understanding from their website and my experience as a transfer student. Good luck!",

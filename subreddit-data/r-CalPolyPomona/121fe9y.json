    "postText": "I was recently accepted to CPP for a b. architecture major and i\u2019m excited! however, i was also accepted to UCSD for Urban planning and development and im pretty conflicted since i only have a month to decide the next 4 or 5 years. \n\nI know CPP is accredited therefore it is 100% better than a b.a. for getting an architect license but i\u2019m wondering how/if they help you find job opportunities and how the \u201clife outlook\u201d is. If i\u2019m going to go into such a hard and grueling major i want to make sure i\u2019d really get good opportunities and be happy with life afterwards. I\u2019m very excited to study architecture, but i want to make sure studying it won\u2019t leave me regretting giving up a nice school like UCSD. I\u2019m also conflicted because I haven\u2019t visited CPP at all (i will visit at least once or twice within the next month) and I\u2019m just not very familiar with the school itself, and I don\u2019t want to be unhappy with the program/school since I won\u2019t be commuting. \n\nUCSD\u2019s urban planning and development  program would allow me to emphasize in architecture and take architecture courses, but its not accredited, therefore if i certainly wanted to become licensed I\u2019d have to go get a masters. i do definitely love the dorms and prefer the location too. \n\nBasically, i want to figure out how well the CPP architecture program supports their students in licensure, jobs, and whether or not i would need a masters after attending cpp architecture. Any and all input is highly appreciated!!\n\n\n\nUpdate: was also admitted to Berkeley\u2019s Architecture program but ultimately chose CPP. Giving up these other two schools is hard but I think CPP\u2019s environment/accreditation will be better for me!",

            "comment": "Professional urban planner here who also taught at an architecture school (not cpp\u2014 I get cpp in my redit feed because my kid is an alum and I used to watch the thread then every once in awhile it reappears) the most important thing to decide is if you want to work as an architect or an urban planner. This is a really hard decision to make just coming out of high school because you probably don\u2019t know that there is a strong difference between the two career paths.  Before I get into that I can tell you a little bit in general, what the experience of each academic program would be.\n\nIn architecture, your education is focused on studio work . You progress through a series of structured studios that are at the core of your education. It\u2019s a cohort-based model so you will be with the same group of people in nearly every class for the full five years.  Studio is a different type of education.  Imagine being in a big open workshop/office space where you spend your day and night working with the same group of people on a specific problem.  Your studio instructor will come in on certain days for a few hours to guide your work and give you feedback.  At certain points during the semester, and at the end of the term you\u2019ll have a public presentation of your work, where your professor along with other professors, and sometimes outsiders will give you feedback that\u2019ll form the basis of your grade.  It could be pretty intense, emotional and personal as educational system..  your class will become like a frat / family / summer camp cabin/ reality, TV set up. With everything that\u2019s good and bad with that kind of situation.  At Cal poly you will have some electives and general education classes where you will mix with students outside of your studio but basically your studio class will be the core of your academic experience.\n\nUrban planning education , particularly the undergraduate level, is much more like a Generall college. You may have one or two studio type classes during the course of your education but it\u2019s way less intense.  You\u2019ll have a lot more classes outside of your major and you\u2019ll mix more with the rest of the university.  \n\nIn terms of career prospects cal poly offers a five year bachelors in architecture. With that degree you can start work pretty much immediately and be qualified to get your license in California.  On the other hand, urban planning jobs almost always require a masters degree. So if you want to be ready to work and urban, planning outside of the few jobs that are open to people with undergraduate degrees, and these are mostly focused on geographic information systems, you will need to go to graduate school for an additional two years. \n\nAs far as job prospects , and I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide how important this is for you at this point in your life, architecture is an incredibly competitive field. It\u2019s exciting, the work is attractive. And a lot of people go into the field. As a result competition for jobs as an architect can be pretty tough. The majority of architects work for private firms.  Urban planning is a little bit different. Because fewer people go into it as a profession, it\u2019s less well known, and because every local government needs urban planners, there is generally a shortage of capable qualified people.  Almost all urban planners work for government agencies with about 30% working for consulting firms in the private sector.  The public sector jobs have lower pay, but better benefits and job security.  The private sector jobs tend to pay a little bit better, but don\u2019t have some of the benefits, both economic and social of working for a municipality.  \n\nI hate how California\u2019s educational system requires people just out of high school to make these big decisions, and I totally feel for you .  Ultimately, this is something that only you can decide.  Basically the main question is what do you want to do with your career? Do you want to be an architect or an urban planer? Can you possibly know the difference at your age? ( I don\u2019t mean that as an insult it\u2019s just that most people don\u2019t know, architects, or urban planners). \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to take advice from some random person on the Internet  ( and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t) please reach out to the undergrad advisor at both the Cal poly architecture, school, and the urban planning program at UCSD. Be honest with them, and tell them what your choices are. While they will give you the most positive view their programs they really don\u2019t want someone who doesn\u2019t wanna be there or doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting into to enroll in the program. If the advisers are too busy, try and reach out to a member of the faculty.  See if they list office hours, real or virtual, on their website and send them an email explaining your situation.  Reaching out and asking for help is a great habit to get into right now. It can be a little intimidating, but it\u2019s really the best way to get information.  You probably don\u2019t have enough time to meet someone who is working in the profession, however, depending on what city you live in, it\u2019s worth going to visit the urban planning department at City Hall and just watch what it is that they do.  attend a planning commission meeting and look at the presentations that the urban planners give to the commissioners. \n\nLikewise, with architecture, reach out to any connections that you or your family might have to people who work as professional architects, and ask to see if you can visit the office and see what they do .  This will be a little bit harder than the urban planning option just because that takes place in public in architecture usually takes place in private.  \n\nI hope the information of given you above helps. Either way remember that whatever you choose. Things will turn out fine. You\u2019re making a choice between two good options. And congratulations on the offer of admission from both programs that\u2019s a big accomplishment in and of itself.",

For architecture, I dont know if I actually have what it takes to walk in first day and get right into architecture, physics, and math. (Ive only taken one advanced physics and calculus class) then end up hating it and it being too much for me, walking out with a degree i dont want anything to do with (or not even getting the degree at all) Once again thank you so much!!!",

Cal Poly Pomona is a commuter heavy school, meaning that many of the people you interact with in class will be just that, in class only. Students will drive out for classes, maybe stay around to study in the library, but ultimately drive home and not be on campus if they don't need to be there. This isn't to deter you, but just to get a bit of an understanding. \n\nHowever, the campus is beautiful. The College of Environmental Design is actually one of my favorite parts of campus. The college itself has a cool design and the surrounding area is very quiet. I loved spending time on campus and it has an all around soothing vibe. While I was a commuter, my s/o lived on campus for two years before transferring to USC (unrelated to CPP programs or anything, she just had the opportunity and was also interested in joining the USC marching band which she did). In the time she spent their she met some of her most genuine and close friends, and she still speaks about how her professors at CPP are some of her favorite of all time. This is because CPP in general has small classrooms, and it's very intimate in that professors are readily available. In the poli-sci major, non of my core classes had a TA, as the professor was the main point of contact for any extra help. I'm sure architecture will be a bit different, but this leads into the main thing I wanted to spend time on.\n\nIt seems like you're leaning towards Urban Planning. If I were you, I'd try to get into Cal Poly's URP program. Even if that means enrolling as an architect major and talking about transferring once you're there. This shouldn't be that difficult considering they fall under the same college. The CPP URP [website is here](https://www.cpp.edu/env/urp/index.shtml). (Note: \"The department is recognized as a national leader in planning education. It is the only accredited undergraduate planning program in Southern California, and one of the largest in the nation.\")\n\nu/deb1267cc is almost always right when he said \n\n&gt;\"Urban planning education , particularly the undergraduate level, is much more like a Generall college\"\n\nHowever, CPP is incredibly unique, and the \"learn by doing\" is not just a saying. Compare the course roadmaps (WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY USEFUL: you can literally see the next 4 years of your life planned out) and you'll see that at CPP, you'll be walking away with practical skills. I'm sure you can find UCSD's on your own but here's [CPP's URP (and architecture)](https://www.cpp.edu/academic-programs/academic-advising/tools/sheets-roadmaps/2022-2023/env.shtml) roadmaps/curriculum for your convenience. \n\nAs part of the URP Minor I took URP 1040/L, URP 1200L, URP 4230, URP 4040, URP 1050, among a couple others but they all had either practical research, labs, or activities that had me or me and a group going out to communities for projects.\n\nThis was true even for me with a poli-sci degree. In the major, we joke it's the degree to pick when you didn't quite know what you wanted to do but had a rough idea - it almost always leads to grad school though. Most of the people at UChicago with me are poli-sci students as well. The key difference between me and them is I have practical experience they didn't get in their programs. CPP's \"learn by doing\" had me writing practical work every semester. For me, that meant researching and drafting Policy Briefs, Literature Reviews, Analytical Research, Argumentative Research,\nQuantitative/Qualitative Research all with original data driven research. At UChicago, I've already had to write some more of these things and was able to do them on my own while others needed additional guidance. \n\nIf you're ultimate goal is job security right out the gate, CPP Architecture is the way to go. If you're interested in pursuing URP, I (biasedly) think you'd get more skills out of going to CPP and transferring into a URP program. And, if you want the best of both worlds, the CPP minor is an incredibly useful door into URP and could set you up in a position where you'd use both skills. \n\nPlease research what UCSD student think of the URP program, as I am coming from a biased position like most anyone in this subreddit. I can't deny San Diego is an attractive option, my s/o is from San Diego and we almost moved down there last year before doing a 180 and coming to Chicago. Ultimately, the program you choose alone won't make or break your future. Rather, it's what you decide to do during the 4-5 years (i.e. are you on top of internships and networking, discussing with faculty how to improve and become a desirable hirer etc etc). \n\nI wish you luck and will make myself available if you ever want to discuss further!",

Any accredited architecture school will run an internship requirement where you HAVE to go work for a firm for a set amount of hours (500 I believe though it\u2019s changed for COVID), and this is how a ton of people find jobs. The school offers \u201cFirm Day\u201d once a year where they invite 100+ firms that are interested in hiring both interns and full time employees, which also helps. \n\nAfter your bachelors, you won\u2019t need your masters unless you\u2019re so inclined or you\u2019d like to teach in studios rather than work in a firm. You\u2019d be completely set to start your licensing at your own pace. \n\nThere are a number of firms that have echoed to me and other people that they love CPP arch students, and will even typically hire more from there, so from my experience, you\u2019d be set in terms. Even after graduating, the school keeps alumni in the loop about job openings and other things.\n\nYou\u2019d be at one of the best arc programs in the country, and very well connected about jobs and opportunities, but of course, the campus and location can never match anything like UCSD",

I can\u2019t speak from a student perspective, but from looking at it from the college level, the program is stellar and it\u2019s reputation is equally stellar. My experience (limited by being a different department) is that students who do well in the architecture program go on to be successful in the field. I admit to confirmation bias, and presumably only high performing students reach out to professors in other disciplines so their success rates are reflective of them more than anything. But honestly, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better public architecture program anywhere in the country. It\u2019s known to be an incredibly hard program. But there is an immense amount of talent there. You\u2019ve got this.\n\nLastly, the bArch is a 5 year program which means you aren\u2019t required to get an mArch, (unless you want one) and I\u2019m 99% sure you graduate with a liscense. \n\nIf you end up here say hi to the folks in URP, LA, and the Art Department.

            "comment": "Old timer architecture grad here.  I'm a bit late chiming in here and don't want to say too much because so much good information has already been shared here.  You're fortunate to have this community here to help you out on this very important decision.  In a nut shell, it depends on how much you want to be an architect or urban planner.  It sounds like you like architecture but are a bit on the fence.  For myself, I like \"urban\" architecture, especially housing because it combines buildings with the social aspect of having to help people find quality affordable shelter close to employment, transportation, shopping and other amenities.  I can relate to your affinity for an exciting college environment that an brand name school like UCSD would provide.  I felt the same and got accepted to several UCs but chose CPP architecture because I wanted to be an architect above all else.  I will admit that while CPP has a charming campus where I met many lifetime friends, I only wished that it was a livelier place with some semblance of a \"college town\" feel, which is definitely not.  As an architect, I am endlessly frustrated that the CPP does not work enough with the City of Pomona to change zoning and transportation to remedy this situation.\n\nAs for your concerns about CPP ARC, it most definitely will prepare you to become a skilled and well rounded architect.  As mentioned by others, it's centered around the design studio for the entire 5 years.  This is a unique experience that you will never get in a BA or MArch program.  You will also take an entire year of structures (engineering) and architecture history as well as a few classes on environmental controls (energy and sustainability).  A few unique courses that other schools do not offer are non-western architecture history courses such as Latin and Native American, Japanese, Chinese architecture, though that was 25 years ago.  Also unique were a series of Behavioral Factors courses which deal with psychology and human interaction in the built environment.  In other words, the program is very well rounded and in hind site reminds me of a private liberal arts college on the east coast (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating).  Also, if you go there be sure to take the Integrated General Education if they still have it which is an alternative to taking the traditional GE courses and is a discussion based series of courses on the liberal arts.\n\nMy biggest take away from an architectural education is that you're there to learn not just the skill of being an architect but also the ability to think critically and problem solve.  I now have my own private practice and have projects ranging from small residential renovations, to larger apartment buildings to even larger site master planning.  Every project is unique which is why it's important to develop a critical mind.  Some of my classmates have gone on to other fields such as IT and computer programming while applying the same skills learned in school.  You would definitely be able to pursue an urban planning degree if you so choose after completing an architecture degree.\n\nAs for UCSD, you may not know that they did attempt to start and architecture program in the 1990s but lasted about 2 years.  Apparently, running an architecture program is very costly and challenging so the fact that CPP is one of only 2 public, accredited undergraduate degrees in a state larger than most countries is quite the treasure and very affordable.\n\n[https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb3653166c/\\_2.pdf](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb3653166c/_2.pdf)\n\nI don't meant to take anything away from UCSD.  You can get a good college experience there and then focus on architecture for your masters.  Many people take that route.  I seriously thought about studying engineering at UCI as a backup so I was glad once I got into CPP ARC.  I have no regrets.",

Go to an actual architecture school if you like design.\n\nCPP is accredited and you'll be able to get a job with just a bachelors.",

Yeah the accrediting thing is definitely what is troubling me, since on one hand i dont know if i truly want to work as an architect so i might be wasting 5 years on a degree that isnt meant for me. Whereas in urban planning i can get an accredited masters if i do find that it is for me, since i do want to get a masters no matter what i do. Thank you for your input!",

            "comment": "It sounds like CPP is the better choice in this case. Accreditation is important and CPP has both a great architecture program and urban planning program, whereas UCSD only has 1 option.  If architecture doesn\u2019t work out at CPP, urban planning is still here.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to go from urban planner to licensed architect than it is to go from licensed architect to urban planner. Architecture is hands on, while urban planning is more policy related. Having technical skills in your arsenal makes it easier to pivot into a new career. And the college is always sending out internship opportunities.\n\n\n&amp; regarding the self doubt, I relate to that so much. But please don\u2019t talk yourself out of it before trying. I came into my masters program (college of ENV design but different major) thinking I lacked all the skills to be competent in the field. But I\u2019ve realized the professors in our college aren\u2019t expecting new students to be a prodigy in the field, they help &amp; guide us through it. You\u2019ll gain creativity and skill the more time and exposure you have as an arch major.",

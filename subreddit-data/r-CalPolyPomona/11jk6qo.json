    "postText": "An old friend told me he went to UCR and didn\u2019t submit his immunization stuff and still attended and Graduated ; Given that information was from 2018\u2026..\nMy question is how important is getting this \u201cimmunization\u201d task complete in order to transfer in and take classes?\n\nI\u2019ve already sent my highschool and college transcripts. I\u2019ve already accepted admission and set up my orientation appointment, but this immunization thing is like the last thing on my mind. I don\u2019t care for it and I\u2019m pretty sure I got it all done at birth. Can I ignore it??!",

Things might have relaxed a bit due to the pandemic, and they may not have required proof of vaccinations just because we weren\u2019t in person. But more requirements might be put back into place now that we are back in person. I would call the CPP health center to verify the information.",

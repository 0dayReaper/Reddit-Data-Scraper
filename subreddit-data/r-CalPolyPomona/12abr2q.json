    "postText": "Hello I got admitted as a CIS major back in March and CPP is one of my top choices right now. \n\nScrolling through this thread I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s a common major and I have some questions. Overall I wanna know what the major is like. I know it splits off into 3 sub emphasis and I plan on doing foresenics as I plan on leaning into the cyber security sector. Does this sound like the right choice? Mind telling me your emphasis and the classes so far and how much you like it? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Yea I graduated in the forensics emphasis as well and it does just as great as the other 2 emphasis. It really is want you want to do outside in the workforce because being an IT overall is very broad.\n\nYou can learn the emphasis and when you get into the field, they can have you working and leaning towards maybe like app dev. as an example. \n\nCPP essentially gives you a fantastic, somewhat basic overview of each emphasis with each teaching you the fundamentals. It's not going to give you a deep understanding of the field. If you really want to delve deep into cybersecurity or any other emphasis, you *HAVE* to supplement it with other learning opportunities: clubs, internships, certs, etc.. as what I got from what you learn in CPP is pretty much the basics.\n\nYou joined the right school for tech, as the CPP degree carries a tech reputation and you'll get recognized once you go outside, but don't let just the school teach you cybersecurity as I would say it's adequate but not something that will earn you a high paying opportunity (if you don't take and supplement what you learn) off the gate.\n\nBeing an IT, you have to learn more on the outside to really specialize in a field. So if you want, join FAST, SWIFT, whatever, to help you with being a specialized IT.",

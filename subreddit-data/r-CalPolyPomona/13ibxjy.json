Unless it\u2019s something new they added this year, I\u2019ve never heard of it.\n\nAs far back as I can remember and going to my uncles commencement way back pre 2010, I don\u2019t think there was ever VIP. I could be wrong though but idk why the school would offer VIP tix if they give you a limited amount of seats for free",

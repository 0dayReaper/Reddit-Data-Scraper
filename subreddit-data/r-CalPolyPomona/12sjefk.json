    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo I'm going to be living off campus next semester and was wondering if I should just start my lease in May instead of August. I'm primarily looking for places on the facebook page for CPP off campus housing. Main reason for considering this is so that I can actually secure a place and be settled in when I actually decide to move in. Issue is, I'll be basically paying 2-3 months of free rent. \n\nAnyone have any experience with this? Do the amount of posts for housing go down in June/July? Planning to move in mid-August. \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks.",

            "comment": "Hey, I was on the same boat last year using FB CPP group to look for housing. I started looking in August because I was in living in North cal for the summer. I had posted last August that I was looking for a room to rent and had plenty of people sending me messages about a room to rent. I think if u are trying to get an apartment either by yourself or with people that you do have to start looking early and pay for the summer. But if u are just renting a room, it's easier because plenty of people have rooms available. \nSince i graduate this year, I'm moving out of a house that's like 10 minutes away from CPP and I was paying $800 for rent with utilities included. So u can find something.",

            "comment": "I would suggest to look as early as possible. Maybe you can apply for summer school or get a job on campus to get familiar with the area so you won\u2019t just be wasting money on the place (should you get it). Places are going to be taken fast and I know for sure there are a lot of students applying for on campus housing and the village\u2014both of which won\u2019t have a lot of spots available so they\u2019ll be looking near campus as well. By that time, there definitely won\u2019t be many options for private places to rent (living alone vs. with randoms) unless you go further than the school\u2019s area code. You could always try renting a room. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a place in chino, if that\u2019s any indication of how not hopeful I am of being closer to campus. \ud83d\ude2d",

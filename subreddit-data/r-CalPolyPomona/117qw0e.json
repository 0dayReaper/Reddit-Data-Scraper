    "postText": "Incoming freshman here!\nI've been trying to research up on cpp's esports climate and wanted to see if anybody here has some first hand experience on it. I also wanted to ask if it is worth joining a competitive team for team based shooters like overwatch 2 or valorant (mostly the former) and if theres any benefits to being part of one. For example, will i hypothetically receive money to pay for college expenses? I just don't know if it's worth grinding a game to the highest level in order to compete while also having to be responsible for my education. Thank you!",

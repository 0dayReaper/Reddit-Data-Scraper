Employers only care that you have a decent GPA and have internships. California schools are overcrowded making it difficult to graduate in four years, overcrowded dining halls, overcrowded housing and ridiculously large class sizes. \n\nSo, pick one, do your very best and get those internships.\n\nCollege debt is a killer, do your best to minimize it.",

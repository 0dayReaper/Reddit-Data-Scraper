    "postText": "This is the second time I've failed Stress Analysis (ME3190). Am I allowed to take it again? How many times am I allowed to retake a class?\n\nSpeaking specifically about the class, I swear its impossible. Castiglianos Theorem might as well be magic to me. Absolutely nothing intuitive about it. And then fatigue analysis has so many steps, that 30 minutes doesn't feel like a long enough time to do do them on an exam. Most of the concepts are understandable to me, its just doing problems in a timely format during an exam that's particularly difficult. And it doesn't help when exam problems toss in a few extra concepts, or reformat a problem in a unique way, because it just takes more time to reality check and comprehend the problem. I also just wish there was someone who I could talk to and just ask the most trivial questions about solid mechanics and stress analysis, in general, because it's usually the small or procedural stuff that I get stuck on, anyway. I know the LRC is a thing, but, correct me if Im wrong, tutoring is only available certain days out of the semester for specific topics. Anyway, rant over, I just want to be able to take this class again and have this nightmare behind me. I just hope this doesnt mean I have to drop out or anything, though.",

Form study groups with people in your class. Make sure you are sleeping well so you can retain information. Try to get good nutrition in so you have energy to do your homework. Best of luck to you!",

There was one time i failed my math class but i did everything the proffesor said. I got like a D and I need to take it again. I took it with another professor. Less homework and the exam was easy. I can easily get an A. So sometimes it depend with the professor too. But if its already the easiest professor, you probably need to find a friend to take the class together, find classmate to study together. Also let the professor know that you have been failing two times and this is your last chance so they can help you. Be nice to them too! When you are nice, proffesor likes you, they might go more easy with you. Not too strict on grading! Hope it helps!",

Only calculus you'll really need is basic integration for castiglianos. Other than that, its just algebra and formulas. The tough part of the class is the time constraint and conceptual portion of knowing what to plug into where and how to obtain something you need to solve for something else, kinda like a puzzle.\n\nedit:\n\nI had Professor Rejali and passed with a B+.

There's are multiple ways to approach the problem and they can be very different from how the prof demonstrates the process in class.  \nOther than that, though, there are a few other topics that use Calc to explain fundamental concepts, but you don't actually integrate or derive anything.

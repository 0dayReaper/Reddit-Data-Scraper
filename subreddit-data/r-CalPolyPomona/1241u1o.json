            "comment": "The reality is that CPP is a great school, but your social life is entirely dependent on how much you involve yourself. Situations for meeting people don\u2019t fall in to your lap, so take initiative and make plans with people. Join/form groups. As with every school, there are some really incredible professors and some that are lackluster. The nature of your professors also tends to weigh heavily on your major. For example, physics professors are incredibly knowledgeable, and generally nice people, but a lot of people would regard them as being more serious and difficult.",

I myself was a commuter and I made some good friends during my time there but I definitely did have to go out and pursue that. Professors were pretty good, especially once you get into the core courses of your major you will get to know them a lot better. As for parties, i only really knew about the greek parties and I didn\u2019t go to any as well. All in all, I had a great experience there minus Covid. But you should enjoy it!",

A lot of people do forget that CPP has a Game Room so could check it out if you\u2019re bored with a lot of time one day.\n\nOh yeah, and try not to get hurt or get sick while on campus. The Student Health Services is uphill and it\u2019s a bitch to walk to.",

If you're expecting going into any university and having everything handed to you with ease, you're going to find yourself having a hard time adjusting. \n\nA good start might be to live on campus and surround yourself with your peers outside of class, since that's kinda what socializing is all about. Best of luck to you OP.",

There are fun things to do but it's definitely not a \"college town.\" CPP focuses on education and a \"learn by doing\"  approach. You're not going to have a stereotypical college movie experience here. I preferred it that way and got an amazing experience that has greatly boosted my career.",

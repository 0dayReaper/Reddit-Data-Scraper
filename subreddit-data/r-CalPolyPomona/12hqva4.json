I'm doing a project about commuting at CPP, and my group's goal is to get an insight into commuting habits and how to possibly improve public transit, and increase the percentage of its use. \n\nThe survey is simple and should take about 5min. Feel free to message me if you have questions, suggestions, or comments.\n\n[URP Commute Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdt4lJVSCqY8Vwi4kcJBQ315eYa5ONtUFtVELs1HKRzsr5y2g/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

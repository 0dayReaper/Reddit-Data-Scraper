The project was assigned around the third week and due last week. It is very open-ended, and would have to meet with Bahr for approval. Most people made bipedal robots. I made a prosthetic arm.",

The final project required you to come up with your own design using Adam\u2019s or RoboDK, pending his approval. It\u2019s pretty open ended. He even lets you complete the project well after the finals deadline, he\u2019ll just give you an incomplete or something until you submit it for grading, upon which he\u2019ll change your final grade. I submitted mine a month after it was due. Homework\u2019s were easy, midterm and final were ok. Just study and you will be fine. Labs literally just require you to show up and participate. If the TA\u2019s see you there you\u2019ll get all the credit. If everyone wants any extension on an assignment, Bahr will more than likely grant it. He pushed back due dates at least half a dozen times when I took the course last semester.",

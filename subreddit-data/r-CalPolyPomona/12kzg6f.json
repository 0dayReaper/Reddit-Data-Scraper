    "postText": "Hey all,  \n\n\nI have a (good) problem here in that I have been accepted into both UCI and CPP to finish my Computer Science BS, but I am not certain which route to go and I am seeking a little feedback from peers in the hopes that it will make the choice clearer.  \n\n\nSome background information that might be relevant; CPP already released their financial aid package, and before Cal Grant is even factored in, they are offering about $8k more per annum than the cost of their tuition. As I  understand it, UCI won't release those packages until next month, and I kinda need to make the decision before that, but I have an EFC of $0 and another UC offered a package that breaks even with tuition, so I am wondering if it is possible that UCI will do the same?  \n\n\nI've also heard that industry recruiters commonly scout out and offer jobs to UCI computer science undergrads, so if true, that might be a better deal even if CPP is giving the better FinAid package. Any thoughts or anecdotes would be appreciated immensely!",

Also probably won't get as much financial aid there as you would at cpp. The only thing you really have to worry about is if you want to do quarter terms or semesters. Some people say the quarter system is a little fast paced and puts more pressure on you but if you think you can handle it go to uci.",

            "comment": "Minimize your debt. One of the biggest things to consider is if you are going to live on campus or off campus and the commute. Consider the distance/traffic of that commute. Staying on campus will be stupidly and outrageously expensive which will blow your financial aid out of the water. Commuting from far away and sitting in traffic will eat up your time and lower your quality of life. You could also try to find a bunch roommates to live with off campus nearby.\n\nI was in a similar situation. I got into CPP, Long Beach and UCI. Since I just commuted (~30 mins) to CPP it was free and FinAid paid me $1000 a semester ($2k a year). I was able to graduate debt free last year from CPP, had I gone to UCI I would have been in almost $100k+ in debt if I had stayed on campus. Getting paid $8k a year while going to CPP is amazing for a college student versus graduating from UCI with a shit-ton of debt. Also, CPP has a great reputation (at least for engineering). \n\nI would accept and put the deposit in for CPP and then see if you\u2019re going to be in serious debt for UCI once their FinAid package comes through. If UCI isn\u2019t going to leave you with crippling debt, then just forfeit the CPP deposit.  But man $8k a year for being college student??? I really think this is a no brainer unless there\u2019s something super special about UCI\u2019s CompSci that makes it worth the debt.",

I don't know if UCI's computer science program is all that special, I just know that there is a significant software industry presence located in Irvine, and landing an internship (and job, subsequently) while at UCI is supposedly really easy.",

As Naruto Uzumaki says, \"believe it!\". What will get you roles more easily is you learning how to network and build relationships with your fellow classmates, alumni, professors, and everyone you come across in school. What you shouldn't be doing is ultimately blaming your inability to do so just because you attended a certain university. \n\nUltimately, whichever school you decide on will honestly not matter one bit to your career prospects in the long run. Believe it.",

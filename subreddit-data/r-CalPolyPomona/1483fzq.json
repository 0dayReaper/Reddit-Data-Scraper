That\u2019s 5 courses per semester! I would really love to finish in 2 years but 5 courses seems so stressful. Anybody here join the pledge? Do you regret it? Should I join?",

Use the calender system and download the canvas app to check stuff on the go. Pay attention to due dates and time yourself how much time you need to finish an assignment. For basic assignments I can do it in one day.",

I wouldn't say u can't manage a part time job as well but it's all about that discipline.\n\nPros:\n-start your career faster\n-get all the good professors\n-pick the time schedule of classes u like first\n \nCons: \n-stress\n-Burnt out if u take no breaks or do other things",

Ppl say that 5 classes is doable if you manage your time well, but how exactly are ppl managing their time? \nAre they going to the 5 classes divided by Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday on campus or two classes on campus and 3 online? How do you dedicate one class a day to homework? I have so many questions but I feel like I\u2019m just ranting at this point. I wish I could just see what individual routines looks like for current full time students\u2026",

I\u2019m not sure if I took the promise plan but 5 classes is doable if you stay committed (I\u2019m not the best at time management and still pull through).",

It does not account for the burnout that can happen from taking 15\u201318 units, nor does it prevent classes from getting cancelled due to low enrollment. Remember to take breaks in between your classes. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that you will have to get classes preapproved by a Promise Pledge advisor before next semester\u2019s registration date for you to stay in the program",

Plus you can drop the class during the first week of school if you find it hard and unable to pass the class. Anyway, i think it is also important to find friends with the same major with you so you guys could share which professor is easier, or if your friend ever took the class he could share you the quizes answer\ud83d\ude1b you guys can also take the class together and help each other. Having a good professor is important because sometime you work hard to pass the class, bad proffesor just make it hard for you. Plus taking 4 classes or 5 classes tuition fee almost the same. You can save your money and your time instead of spending it for another semester at cpp if you can make it in a couple semester. I hope all of this helps!",

This makes a HUGE difference as you will get the best professors and you will always get ur classes on time!!! So as long as they provide that it is definitely worth it!!",

Note that you have to pass all your classes with a certain letter grade and have to get classes approved by a pledge counselor every semester. I was an international business and marketing major.",

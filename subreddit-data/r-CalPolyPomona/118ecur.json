Just being within proximity is a concern imo and some of the problems that exist in Pomona (and other adj. areas) are spilling over onto our campus once again.\n\nI remember similar images popped up quite a bit before 2020, but COVID + remote learning provided us a nice break from the criminal activity TBH. Now that most people are back on campus, of course the criminals are coming back to \"work\" as well. \n\nWith an economic recession looming and possible slow down in the job market as well, University PD and President Coley will need to step up enforcement and implement more security based deterrents before things begin to escalate.",

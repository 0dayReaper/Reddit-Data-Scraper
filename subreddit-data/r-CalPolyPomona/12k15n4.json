    "postText": "Cal Poly Pomona\u2019s annual \u201cTown &amp; Gown\u201d bike ride will be held Friday April 21. This is a fun ride (not a race) that will explore areas of Pomona (town) near the university (gown). All bikes are welcome. Vic from Vic\u2019s bike shop will do free safety checks on riders\u2019 bikes (arrive early for this). The ride leaves from Oak Lane near PS-1 at 10:00 AM. There\u2019s a short route and a full route. Both routes return via Pomona\u2019s new protected bike lanes on Valley Blvd. The full ride stops at historic Casa Primera where riders will be serenaded by Cal Poly\u2019s award-winning mariachi band. The event is free. Use the QR code to register. It\u2019s always a lot of fun!",

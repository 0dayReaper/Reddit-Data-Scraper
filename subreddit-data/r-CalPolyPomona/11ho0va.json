    "postText": "The Spring one was today, I couldn't make it, but I read the employer list the Career Center put out. It's always tempting to find better offers, but I couldn't help but notice that nearly all of the same employers as last time were then again. Or at least the ones in Education, Non-Profits, and Government jobs. \n\nIt makes sense for bigger companies and organizations to need more people, but it looks like some of these places are struggling to hire or not a lot of people here are getting employed by them (especially government jobs since they move so sluggishly).",

I went to the career center to have them look over my resume which I HIGHLY recommend be done. Companies get I'm sure hundreds of resumes at these things, make sure yours stands out and get them to remember your name. \n  \n3 interviews and 2 job offers. Don't give up hope, it's absolutely possible.\n\nP.S. Don't waste time in the Lockheed Martin line. I felt bad seeing people wait 30min to give a 2min elevator pitch and never heard back.\n  \nP.S.S. if a booth has business cards, take one and email the contact on there mentioning your interest. These emails are usually specific to college recruitment and not widely given out.",

After my internship I got a full-time offer for when I graduate. \nIf u have time definitely attend and try to make the most out of it, some recruiters will push through an application if you make a good impression. If u do not go to a career fair, I was using handshake to apply for jobs and was getting interviews from handshake applications.",

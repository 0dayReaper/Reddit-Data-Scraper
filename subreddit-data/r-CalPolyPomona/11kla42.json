    "postText": "I have priority registration and I just tried to enroll in 2 classes over the summer: a major class in the 1st summer session, and a GE in the 2nd session. \n\nI got the major class in the 1st session, but for the GE class I want in the 2nd session, I got this error:\n\n\u201cError: You cannot enroll at this time. You do not have a Registration Window (Enrollment Dates) to enroll and open registration has not begun.\u201d\n\nSo I tried registering for another professor\u2019s class for the GE class, but in the 1st session instead, and I got it. \n\nI would prefer to have that class in the 2nd session to spread out the workload, but i\u2019m unable to because of the error.\n\nDoes anyone know why I get that error when I try to register just for that specific class?\n\n***\n\nUpdate: I was able to get a hold of the bronco advising center today and it turns out it was because that specific class was only for Summer Boost students. Thank you for your input though!",

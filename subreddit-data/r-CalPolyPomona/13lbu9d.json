Gives study guides and you'll do well on exams if you do the study guide problems. 3 exams total, 1 weekly online hw, 1 weekly online reading + comprehension check\n\nI personally really enjoyed the class and she answers any questions well. Asks us on how she can better teach us, really wants students to learn",

All exams have the same exact questions from the study guide on there so it\u2019s pretty easy to pass. The math portion is difficult however, but I still passed with an A since he curves all exams",

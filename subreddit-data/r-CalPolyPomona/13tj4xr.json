As well canvas is not always accurate because it does account for weight of assignments.",

It\u2019s sometimes impossible to get them to match exactly because Canvas tries to impose its own weighting, so there are probably lots of us who do the final calculations offline. I usually don\u2019t bother trying to reconcile them after final grades get posted.",

    "postText": "Hello, I was reported for plagiarism on an essay and have a meeting on Monday with the Student Conduct Office Via Zoom. I plan to confess to the violation as I\u2019ve been informed that it is in my best interest to confess even though the plagiarism was unintentional. What is the least I can expect consequences wise and what is the most I can expect consequence wise. Keep in mind that this was at the end of Spring 2023 so I\u2019m not sure if that limits what they can do as the semester has ended and this is my first time ever being reported to the Student Conduct Office. So what can I expect from this meeting.\n\nUpdate 6/5/23: So I just got out of the meeting and they are letting me off with a warning. Thank you to everyone who said to deny anything it helped.",

The people at student conduct are very understanding from my experience and if it's an accident like you said I doubt you will get punished harshly. This was from my experience but they are gonna explain what you're accused of and are going to ask questions on the situation. They also list out what are going to be your next steps. If you disagree with how you are punished you are allowed a follow up meeting to discuss and maybe change it.",

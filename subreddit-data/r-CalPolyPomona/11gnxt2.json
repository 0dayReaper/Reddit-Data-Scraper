Our school is VERY tight-knit and our alumni network is just as much so. As long as you do the leg work, this will come in stupid handy down the line. \n\nThat said, going on a side note-- with your extensive (relative to your other peers) line-level experience, you should be able to land a management training role with Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott's programs when they start recruiting for candidates during your second year. \n\n\n\n\nSource: was one of those teacher's pets while at Collins, and I buried myself in being involved as much as I can during that time. Doing that has seriously been extremely advantageous to me since graduating, especially in times like this where I'm unemployed (laid off) and can count the school/alumni to support my new job hunt.",

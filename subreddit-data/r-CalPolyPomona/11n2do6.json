I was told they\u2019d inform me of the appeal decision, they did not, then added a fee of over 100%? \n\nFound out about the whole corruption and scandal and now I\u2019ll be damned if I let some fat cats fill their pockets. Why tf do they need to charge students for parking anyway? Can they not just provide parking passes to students with some sort of verification of identity and just allow all students to park for free? So fucking stupid and corrupt",

All I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m sure the local news would have a lot to say about this and I\u2019m wondering what the school would say if they knew that there would be reporting done outside of \u201cThe Poly Post\u201d.\n\nThe Post is a great resource, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s been enough visibility on this issue we\u2019ve endured. I\u2019m wondering who else would want to hear about this. I don\u2019t know if all the information here has been shared, and I\u2019m wondering whose interest it would be that students are being ticketed so profusely and charged bogus fees without notice and due process. This doesn\u2019t seem to bode well for reputation when funds were stolen from students and disregarded under the guise of some under the table retribution. What exactly is going on? \n\nApparently, none of the money that was stolen affects any of the students. We\u2019re still dealing with the affects of insidious intentions. Being so jaded by corruption might repress any fire we have inside\u2026 but something tells me this is a worthy cause with outspoken value.\n\nDon\u2019t give up, my friend. Advocate for yourself. We can advocate for each other by fiercely advocating for ourselves. One ant can carry one crumb, a colony of ants can take down an entire glorious picnic. Doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re the little guys right now. Many little guys with the same cause are a lot harder to ignore.\n\n\nETA after many edits: A Professor said that in writing, redundancy is valuable. That sometimes the audience needs to be told something and reminded and told again to really grasp what\u2019s being shared with them. I believe that influencing change for a worthy cause is generally the same. I think finding and using the appropriate channels as a soundboard for our experiences will effectively grab the attention of individuals who are curious. Questions need to be asked.",

It will be even worse if they find out from someone else.\n\nIf you tell your family, \"I messed up big time and I need help to get my life back on track,\" you might be surprised by how supportive they can be. But again, I don't know your particular situation.",

As long as you can breath, walk, and maintain a 2.0 at the same time a CSU somewhere will accept you, I was able to transfer back in with a 2.1 GPA. If you don't want to come clean just say something along the lines of \"Animal Science just wasn't for me, so I'll be going to a CC to figure it out.\" No shame in that and honestly it's no one else's business but your own(assuming no one else if fronting the bill). Back in 2011 I was a freshmen History major, at SJSU, with plans to teach. Fast forward a few years and I was on track to be kicked out, I was too embarrassed to fail out so I just left one day and didn't come back. I enlisted and would go on to spend the next 5ish years overseas, looking back at it now I needed all that time for me to understand what I really wanted and what I was willing to do for the things I want. Maybe you just need some time away to figure your stuff out",

Don\u2019t worry about asking for help- people are typically more understanding than you would expect. Tell your family. I also didn\u2019t want to tell mine and it made things way, way worse. If you feel like you aren\u2019t ready and need to take more time off to seek mental health assistance, do it. This isn\u2019t a race, even though I\u2019m sure you feel all sorts of pressure to get through as quickly as possible. \n\nYes, I\u2019ve participated through open university. Get that petition filed for academic renewal! They do take extenuating circumstances into account, so I would talk to someone in the advising center. \n\nSo the thing about open university is it relies on two things: individual professors signing some paperwork for you to add the classes and for you to pay full cost tuition. If you\u2019re on board, then you get the paper signed and turned in, and from there the class works as if you were enrolled traditionally. \n\nIf you have lower division classes left, you can always take them at a community college like Mt. Sac and have them transferred in. They will not only help raise your GPA, but they can help demonstrate your ability to do well in classes for the academic renewal. It can help build your case this way. Plus, this way, you\u2019re getting a bit of a break on tuition. If it\u2019s upper division, then open campus is your best bet. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything about the process. Just bear in mind I\u2019m not an advisor, so reaching out to the BAC will only help. They\u2019re very nice and do want to do what\u2019s best to help you.",

I noticed despite there being a lot civil engineering students, many aren't very involved and I ended up struggling recruiting design and construction leads, positions which where no experience was needed.\n\nI know graduates who weren't involved on campus and had 0 internship experience who struggled. \n\nThis shouldn't happen. Getting involved on campus is easy, attend meetings at the very least (and there most likely is free food and useful info, so why not!)\n\nIf you have zero internship experience, at the very least focus on being involved on campus and even an officer position (there are some positions that aren't even demanding either... And basically freebies). It'll make it easier to get an internship.\n\n**Plan your classes ahead of time on a academic calendar while keeping in mind the prereqs**\n\nYou can do it through CPP Connect planner. You don't have to follow it exactly but it will serve as a good guideline. Aim for 15 units (and no less than 12 is possible)\n\nAs others have mentioned, stay away from MacBooks. Engineering majors AND CS majors I know avoid that shit. \n\nMight edit more later if I think of smt else.",

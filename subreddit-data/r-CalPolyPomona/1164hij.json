Like how the fuck does he expect us to do this? And to top it off he has a midterm coming up on said topics. Fml, oh and it\u2019s a two unit lecture.

OP can complain to the Department Chair about any instructor. However, if OP wants the complaint to be 100% anonymous (even the Chair doesn't know who you are), that might be difficult since the Chair would want to know that you are an actual student in the class and not some random person who is picking on an instructor for some reason. The Chair should protect your identity from the instructor you are complaining about.",

I read my book on breaks at work, did flash cards in the car, etc.\n\nAnyone in that position has to want it badly enough to overcome the discomfort of the short term sacrifice they\u2019re making. It was hard but I don\u2019t regret it at all. In fact, I think it taught me a lot of skills, especially time management, that will be super useful in my career!",

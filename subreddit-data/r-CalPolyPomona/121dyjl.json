I read the policies but it wasn\u2019t explicitly stated\u2014 at least not in a way I understood. \n\nIt\u2019s technically Saturday now and I want to park in the faculty parking in the F lot (F4) cause it\u2019s super lit up and there\u2019s a couple other cars here. I\u2019m looking for solid advice based on actual rules, nothing anecdotal please! Cannot risk it :)",

Not very clear, but it doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t park overnight. Sounds like you\u2019re good since you\u2019ll be on campus studying.\n\nhttps://www.cpp.edu/parking/permits/parking-policy.shtml",

Either way, there will be many more all nighters pulled in the computer lab \ud83d\ude06 I have a whole lot to get done and there\u2019s something about working through the dead of night &amp; walking out in crisp morning to feel the early sunshine that\u2019s much more peaceful than the lull of afternoon research\u2026 also I don\u2019t sleep much so it\u2019s nice in there \n\nYou have a wonderful spring break also!!!

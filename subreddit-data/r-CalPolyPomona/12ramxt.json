    "postText": "I was accepted into all Cal States and I am down to these last two schools.  I am currently trying to decide which school is best in terms of social life and education. I've been doing so much research into both schools and reading reviews but in the end I still don't know what to do. I thnk I'm leaning more towards CPP for their Information Systems since I've heard that is better in the education department and the social life is dependant on myself.   \n\n\nI wanted to hear it from you guys on your pros and cons of the school of CPP and Cal State LA for their social life/computer informations systems major.  \n\n\nI would be commuting to both schools since I live in the middle of both of them with CPP being a couple minutes more.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a incoming transfer junior",

Did not feel safe so I went with CPP because well it is MUCH closer, but still ass to drive 20-25 miles each way. Cal State LA is a great school though and I assume it is much more social than us CPP's (most are prob studying their ass off and have no time for extra stuff esp if they work as well)",

I really wish instructors would upload their syllabi weeks before the semester even begins, it gets frustrating when everything piles up all at once, and don't get me started when they upload an old syllabus then say a week later \"I need to update it\".\n\n I have ADHD and my mind gets numb with how fast things move all at once in the first few weeks of the semester. As a result I've already missed two assignments in two separate classes, behind on quite a few readings as well. Need to get off reddit in the meanwhile I guess. \n\nThankfully this is my last year, but it gets me thinking if I really want to do a PhD one day.",

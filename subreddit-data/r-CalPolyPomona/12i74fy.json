    "postText": "Hello! I got admitted to Cal Poly Pomona and San Jose State University for Business Administration. While I like both schools, I love CPP for its campus and its farther from home, so its a new experience for me (which is what I want). I know SJSU has a very good business program and opportunities, so career-wise and opportunity it might be better. I was hoping for some people to just give advise and insight into their opinion about both schools and their business program.",

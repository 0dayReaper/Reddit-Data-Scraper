    "postText": "One of my classes has 5 total assignments and for the past 3, i had a solid C grade. Then the midterm happened and dropped my grade with the class mean being about 50-60%. I do not think i can pass even if I get As for the last two assignments. So i\u2019m asking if its smarter to drop or fail",

Than to work all this way for an F. That way you learn the material and if you happen to have to retake the class you\u2019ll already be ahead. And if you pass well all of this won\u2019t matter anyway.\n\nSource: someone with multiple WUs on their transcript",

You missed the deadline to drop with a W, which doesn't count against the GPA, long ago. Just retake the class and the new grade will replace the WU/F\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: I've failed plenty of classes and would rather just take the F with the slight chance of getting a D then to throw in the towel now and give up, which is pretty pointless considering the results of a WU and F are the same",

Your gpa will go down until you retake it.\n\nBut if you end with an A,B, or C, you can't retake to change your grade/ gpa. Only retake for your own edification.\n\nI'm not sure, if someone else can confirm or deny please do.",

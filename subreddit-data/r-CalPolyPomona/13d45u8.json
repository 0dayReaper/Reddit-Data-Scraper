In this case the professor approved of it but what I wanna know is, would the professor be well within their rights to say something like \u201cI\u2019m anti-war. Don\u2019t ask me for that ever again.\u201d???",

It's just like how I had a professor say I couldn't bring my service dog to class but because denying me that right is illegal all I had to do was go over his head and the problem was fixed. \n\nMilitary orders apply to a lot of different things, like if you have a lease for an apartment you can drop the lease with military orders as proof without any of the negative consequences of breaking a lease (like paying all their fees).",

Most professors make subtle changes to the readings and assignments, but generally the learning outcomes are similar. If a faculty member has a policy about absences, that would be something they could enforce. However, the way you presented the situation--falls more under discriminatory or punitive actions. You may have a case to present to the department chair and/or the dean if the situations leans more in that direction...Which could result in a number of outcomes that I don't know enough to go forward with. But most professors would not outright state a personal feeling such as \"anti-war\" as a rationale for not approving an absence. They would just state the policy on their syllabi and avoid that kind of mud slinging.",

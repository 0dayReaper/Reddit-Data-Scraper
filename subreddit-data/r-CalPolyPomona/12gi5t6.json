    "postText": "I'm sorry to be one of the many basic noobs asking for help but I figured I would just reach out too see what ya'll think. \n\nGot accepted as a transfer for Mechanical Engineering at UCR and Cal Poly Pomona. I got rejected from UCI so it looks like these 2 are my main choices. I like both equally. I've visited both campuses and am equally happy. I was really impressed CPP, but I also like UCR too.  I know nothing about the classes, professors, curriculum, the details. Both are basically equidistant from where I live. Money isn't too much of a problem. Culture and social activity is important to me, but not the most important. Good professors and classes are important. Dorm quality (and to some degree, price) are somewhat important, because I probably will live on campus for at least one year. \n\nMy main goal is to just get a good job (preferably in SoCal) after college and start working. Idgaf about higher education. \n\nWhat would you guys recommend? I've heard a lot of people recommend CPP over most UC's, but I do like UCR so I want to be extra sure. Thank you guys all for the help, I really appreciate it. If anything, your tips and experiences are valued. Thanks!",

Rock climbing, indoor soccer, etc. Lots of good food around campus. There are tons of different freeways around/ roads to commute to cpp. \n\nCollege is what you make of it. I went to soccer games, won free tickets to an edm festival in LA, and had free shirts/merchandise for going to things. \n\nAlso, the brewery is pretty good. 10/10 pizza. We still go to bingo night every now and then. We used to win a free pizza and return on bingo night to win another. \n\nThey also have a wine class that people take if they just need a few credits to graduate or fill their schedule. It's a hell of a walk, but it was really fun when I went. Learned a lot of information that makes me seem somewhat knowledgeable about wine. Plus, you get to go on a trip to a Vinyard. \n\nAnyways, hs friend went to ucr. She just went to school and went came home. So honestly, for fun experience, college is what you make of it, like I said.\n\nI went for psychology, so I can't tell you about the department.\n\n\n\nEdit: Also, we rented a house. It was 300$ a person with 5 people. Everyone got a room. There was a pool, and it was 5 minutes from campus. There are lots of houses for rent, and people are looking for roommates every semester. We used a realtor to help us find people.\n\nAlso, riverside is well... Riverside. People live out there to commute into LA because the houses are more affordable. We recently bought a place, and our realtor basically said that you only live out there because you either work at a warehouse nearby or because it's cheaper to get a bigger house out there.",

You\u2019re also closer to big metro areas like LA and OC so you\u2019re closer to more fun things. Prestige is not much of a thing in either.

At CPP, u r more hands-on with way more lab while in UCR, it's more theory and research. Social life can be tricky because both schools are commuter school but if u gonna live on campus, it shouldnt be too difficult to make friends. Whether u r at a commuter school or residential school, ur social life depends on how much u put urself out there and try to make friend. If u gonna wake up and go to class and go back to ur dorm, ofc u not gonna make friends. But if u join club or attend events on campus, making friends shouldn't be hard",

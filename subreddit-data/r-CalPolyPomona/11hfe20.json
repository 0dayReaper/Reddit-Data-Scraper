(*I'm not Korean though, but I am asian, so take my opinion whatever way you want)\n\n(but please note that it is expensive and I would probably only go if you feel like treating yourself with your friends). The meat quality is good, and the side dishes are superb (that's how you know it's good lol). They cook the meat for you so the meat will always be cooked well, but this does add to the price and tip.",

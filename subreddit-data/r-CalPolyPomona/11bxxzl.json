    "postText": "Hi!  My kid (not on Reddit-) was recently accepted for the Apparel Merchandising/Management program  and hoping to get some insight from current students before making decisions.  pros/cons of attending CPP for what looks to be an outlier of a program in a sea of Engineering and Science majors? Quality of professors and class experience? Campus life?  Any feedback would be great.  Recently toured campus and housing and everything seemed nice and as expected there.  Thanks for any input!\n\nEdited to add clarity to who was posting.",

I had the same concerns that since it was an engineering school that I wouldn\u2019t get the best quality education. I feel like I got the best possible education &amp; for the best price. I also find that it\u2019s easier to transfer over units from a community college over to cpp (as opposed to private universities). The professors are amazing and genuinely care about their students. Of course there is a couple of professors who aren\u2019t the best but I\u2019m sure every school has those. \n\nUnless your child is active in clubs or actively seeks friendships/social events there won\u2019t be much. Since this is a commuter school it\u2019s a little bit harder socially. I personally made my first friend after three years because I\u2019m not very social &amp; also a commuter.",

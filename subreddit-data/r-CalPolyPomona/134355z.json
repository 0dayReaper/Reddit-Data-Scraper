I've got one more year here so I'm looking for someone to move into the extra room for the 2023-2024 school year. If you're interested, feel free to send me a message here or on Instagram (same username).\n\nSerious inquiries only, please. \n-21+ preferred\n-Must LGBT friendly\n-Be able to keep common areas reasonably clean",

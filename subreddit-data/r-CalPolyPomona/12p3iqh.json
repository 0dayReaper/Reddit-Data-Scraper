    "postText": "I am looking to apply to Cal Poly Pomona this fall (I am currently a Junior in High School) and am trying to figure out how the GPA system works. Does the GPA calculation take into account all classes in the A-G requirements, or just the specific number of classes listed (I.e. 4-6 credits of science, I have 15)? I have taken extra courses on top of my normal load to broaden my learning, and while they are all College / IB level courses, limiting the points awarded from honors classes to 8 makes my GPA drop further in the calculator (The one on the CalState Apply website) when I take into account every one of my classes. What is the best way to go about this situation? (By the end of my senior year, I will have taken 71 credits, 37 of which are College/IB/Honors)",

I\u2019m definitely looking at throwing an application at some higher level universities, but looking through curriculum for them I think that CalPoly is the best fit for me. I plan on going into Aerospace, and schools like MIT, Embry-Riddle, and CalTech just have me sitting in a classroom doing math problems for 4 years. CalPoly\u2019s whole \u201cLearn by Doing\u201d philosophy and all the labs I\u2019d get to take are more attractive to me right now. I\u2019d rather actually get my hands on the design process than just do the math foundations.",

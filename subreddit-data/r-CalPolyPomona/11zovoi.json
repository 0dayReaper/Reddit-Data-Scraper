But that doesn't justify other theft, or the occupation of resources that should be available for a student who cares enough about their education to do it the right way. \n\nYou don't get to take from behind the counter at the bank because Well Fargo committed fraud.",

And I do think theft is bad itself but it's understandable why it's so prevalent too, and the school knows it's a problem. I would say it would be nice if there was a compromise and the school lowered the price for the pass so more people would get it, but the same people would skip out on it regardless",

And on average, the education you're getting is *great* for the amount you're paying at CPP -- even if you're paying full tuition out of pocket. \n\nIt's up to you to recognize that and take advantage of it. Otherwise, that value will be squandered. Don't be short-sighted. In the future, if you do things right now, having had to pay for parking at college will be a minimal expense. \n\nIf you don't want to be there, then don't. Go do something else. But leave a space for someone who actually wants to get an education, a degree, and the opportunity to succeed. Don't take it from someone who's paid for the right to park there.",

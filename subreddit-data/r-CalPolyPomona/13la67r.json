    "postText": "I am not sure who up there makes the policies and plans but they aren't clearly thinking straight.\n\nI find it really stupid that UHS wants residents to move out of the dorms on the last day of finals by 5:00 pm.  I don't get why they won't at least give residents the weekend to move out or at least more grace time to move out. 5:00 pm is ridiculous for people who have finals before that and that too that time is peak traffic. If you want to leave later you pay an overnight fee of 40 dollars per night. \n\nIt was worse last year as it was commencement and they blocked the roads for the red bricks when moving out. \n\nI just want to know who thought and approved of this because this is quite impractical imo. I mean I am not really surprised as UHS is known for being the best of the best in providing students with inconveniences here and there.",

I would be surprised if there isn't a good reason why students are required to leave by Friday afternoon.\n\nBut I still think traditions are generally a good thing. They bind large segments of society together and create a sense of community among people who otherwise would want nothing to do with each other. They help create a throughline between generations, forming bonds of support (which perhaps only become evident as you get older). Yes, there are traditions that are harmful to some groups of people and other traditions that fall out of fashion as morals change (I have no problem with not celebrating Columbus Day since he was a terrible person by today's standards). However, overall, I think traditions play an incredibly important role in our society.",

If the people behind decisions don't explain them, those affected have a right to rally against something they weren't given a reason for. If even the staff doesn't know the reason behind a decision that is hurting people, shouldn't we fight it? And if not, shouldn't we at least demand the reason be given?\n\nI get I'm being a little dramatic, but still. It's about people being kicked out of their homes sooner than they think they should be.

I have complained about early move out and the professor is actually right, they have inspections and cleaning as they need to prepare for summer residents. Summer starts shortly after the spring so there isn't much time for school to do all the necessary things. It sucks but that is just how dorming works. Things may not go in your way and it doesn't mean you would always to fight for it to make it your way. School isn't really a charity and they are actually letting you stay with small amount of fee so they are not being totally unreasonable but may be inconvenient for students. The reason is given when you ask, you just didn't look for it enough.",

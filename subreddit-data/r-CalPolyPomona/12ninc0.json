Summer classes are out of pocket and I\u2019m wondering if I wait until another fall to take those classes if I\u2019ll save the money through financial aid.  \n\nIf anyone has been in this position before or has some insight I\u2019d appreciate your advice.",

I'm not sure how old you are or you need to graduate quickly, but what I know is if you do not have that type of money to spend don't spend it.",

            "comment": "I noticed a few ppl saying that you'd have to pay it out of pocket which is true but don't get discouraged just cuz of that!!\n\nIf you get the pell grant, it sometimes covers summer courses. (Personally, I got 2,972.00 from the pell grant for my summer courses but since I'm taking 9 units I only get 75% of it.)\n\nNot only that but if you're within 1-9 units they can give you the summer completion grant which is a good $1k. I'm doing the same (taking 3 classes) and I only have to pay about $75ish out of pocket thanks to both the pell grant and summer completion grant. Of course, it may not be the case with everyone so it wouldn't hurt to ask fin aid office for some clarification. \n\nWhether or not you want to take the classes is up to you. If you for sure want to graduate within 4 years, I would go for it. But if you don't mind staying a semster, then wait till the fall and don't stress yourself out. Good luck!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

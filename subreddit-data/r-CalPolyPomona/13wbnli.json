Going to a different college for undergrad and grad school is an often overlooked \"good idea\".  Each university has it's own approach to teaching engineering due to having a different makeup of instructors.  Some universities are practical others lean towards theoretical.  Being exposed to both will give you a broader view of what engineering is.  Also, you really learn engineering when you go to work.  College gives you a framework of knowledge but working at a good place that has excellent facilities and being surrounded by smart, experienced people is where you'll really learn engineering.  College is just the beginning.",

            "comment": "I'll add another comment that may (or may not!) have some value.  Cal Poly Pomona has a good reputation in California in large part because most of the students stay in the state.  There are a large number of Cal Poly Pomona graduates in the area so you'll probably run into them during your working career.  USC is much better known around the country and the world so if you think you might want to work in a different geographic region USC would offer you better name recognition.\n\nI left California and went to grad school out of state and then spent the next 13-14 years working on the east coast and in the midwest.  I worked at big companies with thousands of employees onsite and many more worldwide.  I presented a few papers at engineering conferences and met a lot of people.  During all that time I met exactly one person who had gone to Cal Poly Pomona and he was a business school graduate.  Whenever I'd talk to coworkers and the topic of \"where did you go to school\" came up I'd mention Cal Poly Pomona and the typical response was \"I've heard of that place.  That's supposed to be a very hard university.\"  I'd say \"Are you thinking of Cal Tech in Pasadena?\" and the reply would always be \"Oh yeah, that's the place.  I knew it was a college that was in a city that started with a P.  Did you go to Cal Tech?\"  \n\nThe midwest university I went to has a huge alumni organization and I run into people all the time who went there.  Part of this is undoubtedly due to people wanting to leave the midwest for places with nicer weather and better opportunities, the other is that it's a big place and they've been cranking out 10,000+ graduates a year (grad and undergrad, all majors) for the last 40-50 years.\n\nI think USC for grad school is a no-brainer, especially if cost isn't a problem.  If you're working as an engineer and going to school part time chances are good that your employer will pay for tuition and maybe books.  I just looked at \"Engineering and Engineering Technology By The Numbers\" 2020 edition published by the American Society of Engineering Education.  (You can download it at their website.)  USC has a graduate engineering enrollment of 6,304 students and graduates 2,623 Master's Degree students.  I assume this is an annual value.  With a program this big the odds are pretty good that you'll be able to find coursework in the are of specialization you're interested in.  The number of alumni contacts you'll develop should be substantial and they'll be scattered all over the country and the world.  Same for Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA, etc.  This could prove useful in the future so do your best to help your fellow students and development friendships wherever you decide to go.  Do the same when you start working.\n\nI can't tell a difference in where people went to college by how good they are as engineers.  I think where you went to college has little effect on your ability to be a good engineer because the academic world is very different from the working world.  However having some name recognition working in your favor might help you get your foot in the door.  After that's it's all on you.",

I\u2019m an anthro alumn from CPP. I had a lot of classmates continue in anthropology. I\u2019m no longer in the field, but I still use knowledge and practices I learned in my new field (education). As someone stated before, the faculty is awesome and really aims to foster their students, but they won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t make connections and seek out the opportunities. I would also try to go to as many conferences in as you can! I regret not attending any anthro conferences like the AAA but as a grad student, the best information I gained was from conferences! Best of luck!!",

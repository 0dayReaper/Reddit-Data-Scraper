            "comment": "Erik Jackiw is one of the worst professors I have ever encountered, he literally didn\u2019t grade the entire semester and just used the other professors grade as the final grade. He throws massive fits over people being slightly late to class on Saturday at 8am. He also has the least interesting course out of any professor I\u2019ve taken",

            "comment": "When I took IME4020, Jackiw was doing it with a different professor. It was overall a shitshow since the double professor thing made everything a lot more confusing. It seemed like the coordination between the professors was left for the students to handle rather than between the professors. The instructions became really unclear especially with projects that was shared between the professors. Tbh, if you are interested in the topic of engineering ethics, google \u201cethical engineering failures\u201d, select a few, look up ethical theories about them, and that\u2019s essentially the entire class without the work and bs.\n\nIdk about Rosenkrantz tho.",

He's an excellent professor in my opinion, and did what he could to make an otherwise dry course more interesting and applicable to engineering.  \n\n\nJackiw was pretty chill. Our 4020 class was mostly essays about ethical decision making. My only criticism is now, as I study for the FE, there's a lot that's lacking in the way CPP teaches the course. I wish they went over more of the code of ethics so we could be prepared for the FE, rather than focus on philosophy, but it's not a huge segment of the exam.",

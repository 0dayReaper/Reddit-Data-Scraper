They could literally jump right out in front of you and most of the time it would still technically be the driver's fault.  If you happen to be speeding or not paying attention (like looking at your phone or something) the consequences can be pretty dang harsh if someone really gets hurt.  I see cars ignoring pedestrian rights-of-way around campus more often than not because people want to make it to class or whatever.  It's not worth it though.",

I can say I've almost got hit or completely run over when it was my legal tern to walk across the cross walk \ud83d\ude03 \nOf course there are going to be people who don't look both ways. But let's not pretend like this college campus is safe for pedestrians to begin with. \nWhen I was taking animal science classes I had a class at the sheep farm. Which is only accessible by drivers. There isn't even a cross walk to get there. Or a side walk. There is nothing safe about having to cross S University Dr. With cars going full speed around a bend.",

I have already confirmed my choice at cal poly pomona and got into their EOP program. I have already registered for my college orientation on June 23 but my parents want me to change it to an earlier date like June 9th because they think I will have more class choices to choose from. Can you guys tell me if this is true and if I should change my orientation? Also, what classes should I pick because I have no clue what I should be doing? Thank everyone who replies in advance!!!",

Even though they reserve you seats in classes,often times the ones they reserve have shit ratings on rate my professor. Well to be fair as long as you stay away from these cs professors you big chillin: Tony Diaz, Edwin Rodriguez, Dominick Atanosio, Saleem Saleem, Sandler seller, Thomas Huang. I think that\u2019s pretty much it for bad CS Professors. The rest are pretty good here. My personal favorite professors at this school are Johansson, Yu Sun, and Navi. If you take them you will learn a lot and get an A! Take them if they are available!",

There are many more great resources on campus, which should be covered in both your online and in-person orientation. Definitely utilize them as best you can. \n\nCongrats on making it here, best of luck with your first semester!",

            "comment": "As a CS major who is finishing up their first year at Cal Poly Pomona, I highly recommend that you choose the earliest registration date possible (within your available schedule of course) since you'll be registering for first semester courses at orientation and to give yourself a chance at getting decent times and professors. If you have a much later registration date, you might end up with 8 AM classes and not so great professors. You'll have more flexibility with the classes you choose since there will most likely be more sections available at an earlier registration date.\n\nRegarding classes to pick, there are 2 freshman CS classes: CS1300 and CS1400 which are Discrete Structures and Introduction to Programming. If you had some prior programming experience before, I recommend that you take these two classes together in the same semester so that you can take CS2400 Data Structures and Algorithms which opens up majority of the CS curriculum for you.\n\nI highly recommend that you join the [CPP CS discord](https://discord.cppcs.dev/) so that you can ask any other CS-related questions. Feel free to take a look at [CPPScheduler](https://www.cppscheduler.com) and [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/school/14774) to get a feel for professor quality. A group of students on the CS discord just released BroncoDirectMe - a chrome extension to help integrate student feedback and RMP data to the class enrollment process.\n\nCPP CS Discord: [https://discord.cppcs.dev/](https://discord.cppcs.dev/)\n\nCPP Scheduler: [https://www.cppscheduler.com](https://www.cppscheduler.com)",

U need to fulfill the general education requirement and ur major requirement to graduate. U will start with English and math classes for gen ed with one or two of ur under class major classes. Don't worry too much now as u will have an advisor to assist u with making a plan. But don't rely too much on them. Make sure to search up ur majors' curriculum sheet online. Just search CPP \"ur major\" curriculum sheet and see what the requirements are for ur specific major. From them, make a plan and go from there. Advisor will help u on orientation on how to sign up for classes and etc.",

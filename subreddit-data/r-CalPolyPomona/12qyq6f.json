    "postText": "Hey, so we're having the repair cafe as usual at the maker space in the second floor of the library, but I need to nip off for a meeting at 2 p.m. to chat with some folks in the MechE department about possibly taking over their nuclear engineering lecture class (EDIT: looks like I'm 1 of 1 they've found for people familiar with nuclear engineering work, so I guess I'll see you MechE energy minors in the fall).  Shouldn't be too long, and Donna and Benji will likely be there to cover.\n\nAnother thing: Guys, I might ask you come back if you stroll in with something complex after 4 p.m. or so,  because I gotta also make sure to get my kiddo from daycare and run some household errands, and I don't want to leave people with half done work.",

    "postText": "Hey @everyone! \n\nI am an incoming transfer student, Fall 2023 (Biology), and was wondering if there are any pre med clubs/opportunities that CPP has to offer? \n\nAlso, what physics do any of you pre med or med students recommend I take?\u2026 this seems to be a highly debated question amongst my friend group. \n\nAll tips or advice is welcome! \n\nTHANKS! \nDani",

            "comment": "The premed and other pre-professional clubs were very active when I was an undergrad here. They had lots of guest speakers, events, and went to conferences together. \n\nRegarding the physics requirement, I wasn\u2019t a premed major, but I\u2019m pretty sure taking the 1200 series is fine. When people looking at apps see the course name there are not going to know the difference.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Source - CPP grad and currently in medical school\n\nI tried to join the premed club but was too busy for much outside school (worked full time in college), but they can help connect you to volunteering opportunities n stuff that could be helpful. They might be more active now post COVID. Good luck!",

Also check out r/premed for guidance but beware of the weirdos on there who are overly negative for no reason lol",

For Physics, the only ones you should take unless you want more physics knowledge/classes are 1210/1220 and their labs I believe. If you have any other questions feel free to ask, I was also a transfer Bio student :)",

    "postText": "I just decided to change my major to Finance recently so I need to attend a Change of Major meeting, but the next meeting is gonna be held next semester.\n\nI already completed the main business courses, so I just need to take the Finance courses now. \n\n**Can/Should I take all Finance classes next semester if I\u2019m not officially a Finance major yet?**\n\nI emailed my advisor but they haven\u2019t responded yet. I was wondering if anyone here could offer any info or advice about it since my registration is on Monday. Thanks in advance",

I admitted as psych and quickly decided I wanted to do sociology so I took/take sociology classes. The change of major takes almost a semester so I would say if you are confident you'll be able to change just do it.",

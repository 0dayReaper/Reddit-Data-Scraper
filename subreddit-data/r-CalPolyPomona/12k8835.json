I didn't submit my application until like March 30th cuz I thought you had to submit the intent to enroll before applying for housing and I wanted to hear from other schools first. I just checked my housing portal and my room selection time is open now. It then said there are no rooms available.\n\nI'm not fully sure how to go about trying to find roommates and off-campus housing, but it seems like that's gonna be the only option at this point?",

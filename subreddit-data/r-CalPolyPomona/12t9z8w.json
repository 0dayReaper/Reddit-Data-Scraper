I\u2019m an only child, so my parents just want to move closer to make it easier and cheaper. I haven\u2019t applied for the housing application and want to apply for a housing exemption. I\u2019ve gone on the portal, but I\u2019m having a difficult time finding where to submit the exemption request/form. Where is it or do I have do submit a housing application before I submit the request?\n\nAnything helps!! Thank you in advance!",

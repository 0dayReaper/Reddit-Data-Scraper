Don\u2019t want to be stuck in traffic for an hour or two and barely make it to your class. There\u2019s Facebook groups for off campus housing if on campus housing won\u2019t cut it for you",

            "comment": "Attendance depends on the class.  You're expected to attend face-to-face classes, and whether that attendance counts toward your grade depends on the professor. Hybrid classes require attendance according to a pre-planned schedule (often once a week). Online classes either meet over Zoom at a specific time (synchronous), or not (asynchronous).  The delivery mode for each class would be published in Broncodirect; you may want to ask your program's advisor for the specifics regarding your schedule.",

I usually do something like that after the first exam because it helps me to understand what I need to do for the class to improve or maintain.",

    "postText": "Hi there, I am a green card holder, I completed my senior year at a California high school and spent two years at a California community college, earning both a high school diploma and an associate degree. Unfortunately, I do not qualify for the reclassification form( I don't have tax papers). However, I am planning to apply for AB540. Do you think I am eligible for it? Even though I have green card and live in Cali for more 3 years\n\n(Waiting for an email from the residency office is quite painful)",

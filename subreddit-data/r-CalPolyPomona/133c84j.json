Apparently in 2018, our school paid a 3rd party company an exorbitant amount of money for creation of a new logo and a new slogan which was \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d If you didn\u2019t grow up watching SpongeBob, this might not seem very funny but the logo was introduced just around the time when childhood SpongeBob watchers were entering college. It was very easy to make the connection and the school silently changed the motto back to \u201cLearn By Doing\u201d as it will remain \ud83d\ude02",

I am confused on how CPP can receive my past AP scores so that I can register for the correct classes for my upcoming freshman orientation. Is it through my official transcript from my high school or do I have to do it through college board?",

Even if your AP scores aren\u2019t officially in the system yet, advisors can look at your college board account and place you in the right classes.",

    "postText": "So while I was filling out my housing application and checking BroncoDirect, I read that I would have to sign up for online orientation and Orientation Day. Attendance for Orientation Day is mandatory and if I don't go my student status will be withdrawn. However, I'm out of the country throughout June and July and I've just emailed orientation@cpp.edu but not sure what else to do. Is there no alternative to attending CPP's summer programs for incoming freshman?",

I\u2019m working orientation this year and there\u2019s definitely makeups and virtual ones in the works. You won\u2019t lose your spot! Good job on emailing, that\u2019s what I would have suggested.",

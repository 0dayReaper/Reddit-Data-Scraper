It\u2019s a small program and doesn\u2019t get much attention. For example, CSUF has a whole building dedicated to the communication department. Im sure there are more scholarships, internships, and job opportunities. I would recommend going to a different school with a more extensive program. But if you went here, it wouldn\u2019t be a terrible thing or bad experience",

I did the org comm option but a lot of professors cross teach in two or more options, get ready for a lot of public speaking, and if you\u2019re thinking of going to grad school after take two or more comm research classes!",

Building 7 was often referred to as a fish tank because you can walk around and see into all the classrooms, however I think it's mostly landscape and urban studies classes these days.  I would think you can wander around the IDC without being noticed though no one would mind and would even be glad to talk.  Visiting the VDL is a great idea and while visiting DTLA, Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice etc. though you'd have to be there on the particular tour day.  Check out their website.  neutra-vdl.org",

            "comment": "Congrats on being accepted as an architecture major!\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if you are referring to next week as sometime between March 25 to April 2, unfortunately we have spring break ([school calendar](https://www.cpp.edu/academicplanning/academic-calendar/documents/2022-2023_academic_calendar_2022-12-6.pdf)). You can probably walk around campus and Building 7 (College of Environmental Design building). However, Building 89 (Interim Design Center) will most likely be closed.\r  \n\r  \nDepending on how long you stay in the area, the Neutra VDL House in Silverlake might open again on April 1 (currently closed in March due to repairs; [website](https://neutra-vdl.org/)). It is owned by our College of Environmental Design and some 4th year, 5th year and graduate architecture students give tours on Saturdays only. So, that could be an opportunity to talk with some architecture students as well as see a nice house. If you are interested, let me know and I can verify with my professor if it will be open or not.",

                            "comment": "Ok. Since it's after spring break, yes, you can definitely visit the campus!\n\nFor architecture, I would say to visit during studio (that's probably one of the only classes you could sit in; everything else is pretty much still online).\n\nDesign studio happens on Monday/Thursday and Tuesday/Friday at 2:00-5:50p.m. (mostly  the same class but taught by different professors). I will probably assume you will be a first-year or second-year so, checking out the IDC/Building 89 would be good (the IDC is divided into three areas: fifth-year studios on the street-side, first-years in the center of the building, and second-years on the horse stable-side). The doors are locked though so, you will need to be let in by a student.\n\nYou can also check out the studios in Building 7 or 3 as well! As long as you aren't disruptive, most students don't really mind if you come into the studios. As for sitting in, I would ask a professor just to be sure (I would assume most of them would be fine with it if you explained your situation).\n\nAnyway, I will mostly likely be on campus on April 3 (I have studio on Monday/Thursday) and possibly April 4 (for another class), so feel free to DM if you have additional questions!",

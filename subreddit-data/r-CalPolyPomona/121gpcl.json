            "comment": "Economics major at CPP has been great in my experience. You\u2019ll have three subplans which are General, Applied, and Quantitative. Each benefit you in their own way depending on what you want to get a career in. Professors have real world experience and are always willing to help. \n\nIt is a pretty small major &lt;200 people in it, so you\u2019ll end up taking classes with the same people which can be beneficial. Classes are &lt;35 which I think is helpful. There won\u2019t be a lot of writing but there will be a fair amount of math, graphing and economic theory. There is a good selection of classes, this can be checked online as well if you want to get an idea of it. \n\nOf course, you only get what you put in. If you are willing to talk to professors and classmates it\u2019ll benefit you very much.",

LA in particular is huge, this can be beneficial for you when applying for jobs but also be your enemy due to the competion you\u2019ll have. \n\nBut as I said it\u2019s what you put into it. Which I mean, network, meet people, talk to people, and build relationships. This will be your bestfriend when looking for job/internship opportunities. It will give you the leg up when applying to places.",

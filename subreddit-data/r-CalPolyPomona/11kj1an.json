Supposedly in a popsci book I read (Survival of the Sickest) sometimes people of northern European genetic heritage get a gene that makes them have greater cold tolerance at the cost of nearly guaranteed diabetes later in life. Only reason why I am not wearing shorts is because I work here.  I think I may have that gene, but I am not getting that tested until I get universal healthcare. \n\nI used to go running in 20f with shorts and a hoodie as an undergrad in Illinois, as an example.",

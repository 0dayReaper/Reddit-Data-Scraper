What this has done is drive the big used textbook wholesale companies completely out of business (there used to be 9, now there are only 2), and disrupt the used book marketplace so thoroughly that campus stores lose money trying to stock used books at all. We are facing a huge write-off of unsold used book inventory that has built up over the past several years.

It\u2019s not as much as IA which bundles the book into it.\nHere\u2019s an actual quote from this article \u201cPart of what makes EA equitable is that it prevents students from choosing their majors based solely on the cost of books. According to the Director of the Bronco Bookstore, Clint Aase, some majors\u2019 textbooks cost more than others, and that barrier should not prevent students from choosing majors like engineering.\u201d Who tf is choosing majors based on book prices? Who even knows the book prices until you take the class and you\u2019re assigned the book? Spoken like an out of touch, wealthy, greedy pos.

Cheating on homework will always be a thing, whether it be through online solution manuals for problems from the physical book or online answers (chegg, etc.) for these online hw systems. Students will find a way, that\u2019s just how it is tbh. Im not disagreeing that it\u2019s to the detriment of the student, but some people are just like that. \n\nMy comment was geared towards professors who were on the fence of using the online system will now be more likely to use it because its \u201cincluded\u201d in the subscription so why not use it. Then for homework theirs a likely chance that they will assign a lot of more problems because it\u2019s easy to set up and more importantly they don\u2019t have to grade it or deal with it, the software does. During my time as a student with the rollout of these online programs, I saw the differences between professors who used and didn\u2019t use the them. Those who didn\u2019t knew it was BS to make kids pay outrageous prices and would assign very certain problems (for example 3, 8, 14, 19; very specific problems that they felt were relevant), or make their own problems. Those using online program would just check a couple boxes and now we have to do arbitrarily do a ton more homework.\n\nThe barrier for professors to use these online program and assign a ton more hw (up to you to decide if that\u2019s valuable or not) just came down with this subscription model. I just feel bad for future students is all I\u2019m saying. \n\nAnd of course it didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, publishers moved to this model because it makes them more money, but it\u2019s marketed as helping the students.

So they went all-in for the current service model (offering online services like randomized questions in homework sets, so-called SmartBooks that would periodically test student comprehension, etc.) just to survive. I don't know how profitable the current model is compared to their old model before the days of free online PDFs.",

Also, will there still be a way we can check our total textbook costs before the semester starts in order to make an informed decision (short of emailing every professor for a syllabus)? Previously we could check the account inquiry to view the individual textbook charges, but now it\u2019s sounding like it\u2019ll just be a $250 charge posted, is that correct?",

As it is its just another way to line publisher pockets, as the vast majority of students won't even realize what they're paying for.\n\nI can also think of exactly one semester where I spent more than $250 on books. There is nothing equitable about this program. There are much better ways of getting your textbooks for cheap.",

            "comment": "Wow, looks like this got a lot of activity over the weekend when I was taking a break from Reddit!  I've responded to a few specific post responses below but thought it would be a good idea to do a broader response/follow up:\n\n*  We decided on a flat-fee model vs. a per-credit hour model partly based on the logistics of billing and financial aid timing, but also to avoid undermining the Graduation 2025 initiative by  creating a perverse incentive for students to take fewer than 15 units a semester. FWIW, other campus charges like the BRIC fee and Student Success Fee are the same for all students regardless of number of units taken. The price is based on analyzing all the required course materials used for the past 3 academic years, and projecting what the materials that weren't digital/IA would have cost if they were in IA.\n* We absolutely will make the individual prices for required books/materials available, we have to for Higher Education Act compliance for one thing, but also we don't want to \"trick\" anyone into staying opted in when they would be better off opting out. My own kid will be a senior here next year as an English major, and you better believe I will TELL him to opt out if his books don't add up to $250 (which they probably won't ;-)). \n* We'll also be hiring additional student staff to handle the increased number of calls/emails/in person questions about this and specifically train them in how to show students what their costs break-down will be outside of the program. \n* There will be just one \"Want to Opt Out\" button in Canvas instead of having to do it for each class or item. You can get an idea how it looks here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPd4tFC5v-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPd4tFC5v-o) \n* Having the program be on an \"opt out\" rather than \"opt in\" basis is the way we get leverage to bargain with publishers. Campuses that have tried to do this the other way around got no discounting from publishers. This is why our current program is \"opt out\" as well. \n* We're getting ready to do a big information push about this program to students, faculty and staff between now and the end of the semester and will work with Orientation to inform new freshmen and transfer students over the summer. We'll have a dedicated URL for it with FAQs and so on up very soon. \n* Why are we doing this? We really believe it will help more students than our current system. But also, as a self-supported campus store, we just can't sustain two different business models operating simultaneously for textbooks anymore given the course materials landscape as it exists today. Used books and rentals are too labor and freight intensive and too risky, leading to too many expensive write-offs that eat up the limited margins we realize on textbooks and put us at risk of being leased out to Follett or Barnes &amp; Noble. And publishers are increasingly moving to \"digital only\" models where they only print books for customers who have already bought digital.",

Her average costs for Comp Sci (yes, she pays for all of her required texts) are less than mine were when I was a student and they're well under the cost for this program.\n\nAs a student equity researcher I wonder whether funding student equity at the expense of other students and employing opt-out models that penalize the less higher-ed-savvy is the most ethical approach.",

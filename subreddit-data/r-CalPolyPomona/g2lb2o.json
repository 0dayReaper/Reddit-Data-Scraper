If you\u2019re that concerned about cheating, then make up your own test questions instead of pulling exams from the internet. Problem Solved! I agree that there are great professors out there who are actually helping, but there are also some that are making an already difficult situation much harder.",

Some professors thankfully, have put the students first and have taken it easy these past few weeks but others.... have gone insane. The administration problems our school has once again came to light. With the suicides this year one would think that the administration would look into the mental stability of the students on and off campus. Personally, I blame for one administration for the handling of the situation and secondly the student board association since they have a more direct line to the higher ups in school. For those of you that are hurting, my heart goes your for you.",

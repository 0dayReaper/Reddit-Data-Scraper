            "comment": "I think you could have probably made your situation a little more clear in your post. A title and no body isn\u2019t the best way to get responses.\n\nAre you currently at a CC and planning to transfer to CPP after your AA, or are you receiving an AA at the same time as your BS and attending both schools concurrently? I would recommend against the second case unless you transfer over a lot of those classes at the CC.\n\nYou are going to end up doing GEs twice otherwise (and paying for them!). Finish all the GEs at the CC, then transfer those into CPP and you\u2019ll only have like two years of core program course work to complete in the Bachelors vs four years of general ed plus core courses. If you are already done with your GEs then it would be silly not to transfer those to CPP. \n\nYou can get both the AA and the Bachelors done in four years this way, and not even concurrently so less of a headache. This is what transfer students usually do. I got my AA in CC then transferred and only had to take care of my upper divisions.",

It\u2019s up to you to transfer transcripts to CPP or not, but you do stand a chance of getting a GPA boost if you do well at the CC. Whichever courses are taking there will count as credit taken here, so long as you transfer them over to CPP when your grades are posted by the college.",

Using the Lyle Center for its purpose could create research opportunities for every college and provide more homes for students. Please keep a look out for my petition later this week!",

There isn\u2019t a permanent director or outreach coordinator. Both of which could help re-engage the student body and surrounding community with regenerative and sustainable learning and research. The facilities have been neglected. \n\nSimply put, given the global focus on sustainability, it is not being used to its full potential. And since we don\u2019t have the CLA building anymore, it could be a feature of the campus!",

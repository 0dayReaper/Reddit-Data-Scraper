    "postText": "Hey everyone! Recently I decided to pursue real estate and have taken a great interest in Cal Poly Pomona and have a hard time deciding between this college and UCR. However, I do have a few questions:  \n\n\n1. How hard is it to find an internship/job relating to real estate during undergraduate/post-graduate?\n2. Is it better to pick another emphasis or pursue another course of study like marketing at UCR? \n3. How \"hands-on\" is the real estate emphasis of FRL? I have heard CSUs are more hands-on and really prepare you for the real world\n4. What did you find was the best/worst part of the program?",

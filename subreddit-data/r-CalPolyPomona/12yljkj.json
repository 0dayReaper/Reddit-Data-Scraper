    "postText": "Looks like I can't come in to help with work today, as I have a munchkin that is staying home from daycare for deciding that headbutting is an appropriate method of playing with a friend.  As I doubt anyone wants a rambunctious 2 year old around while I work on their stuff, I think I'll need to tap out today and have Donna and Benji take over today.  Neil might be coming in at 4ish as well, but we'll see. It IS near the end of the semester.",

In my utopia we take hotwheel style tracks to our commute. You take the five freeway over the volcano jump through the double loop and get off on lakewood. If you hit the jump by the t-rex you have gone too far. EVERYTHING would be car oriented. Jokes aside. We need better walking and biking infrastructure however I'm definitely not opposed to driving 300+ mph to get to home after class.",

As for 'being allowed' into the makerspace, I'm pretty sure anyone is, you just need to get training on specific equipment so you don't break it.   \n\n\nAlso, it's less a club and more just a thing we kinda do at the Makerspace.  I fix things, and I like sharing what I know because I'm a huge environmentalist and e-waste is bad and wrong.",

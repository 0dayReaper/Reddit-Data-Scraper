    "postText": "I hear comments all the time about how parking in J Lot, M Lot, or Magnolia/Oak has so much congestion and that finding a parking spot is always next to impossible. \n\nThe parking is ridiculous in campuses such as Long Beach, CSUF, or some of the UCs I\u2019ve visited compared to what we have here. Yes the parking fees are super high, campus police are stepping up in handing out tickets, and the parking garage is constantly flooded and possibly crumbling bit by bit but that\u2019s beside the point. There are better places to park on this campus that not only provide ample space between lot and classroom, but also are relatively safe. Collins (EDIT: the parking structure, NOT near the hospitality college) is a great parking area IMO, for example. The lower levels usually have places to park and it\u2019s close to the BRIC. Magnolia/Oak (while crumbling) usually has ample parking if you get here in the morning, and by noon you usually can get the spot you want because most people leave for lunch by that time. \n\nOverall, I think CPP has better parking places if you know where to go and when to park, if not the best out of the other CSUs.",

When I had his classes, he would let you work on assignments throughout the semester and you could turn it in at the end around finals week. Idk if he still does that. Exams used to be 7-8 problems long but they used to take 3 hours to do (this was on zoom, I never had him in person). He also talks kind of slow, and his lectures are a bit long. He\u2019s super nice and is happy to work with you on any problems, but if you think his teaching style might not suit you, then maybe look for someone else. \n\nI personally struggle a lot with long lectures, so it just wasn\u2019t for me. He\u2019s a great professor though.",

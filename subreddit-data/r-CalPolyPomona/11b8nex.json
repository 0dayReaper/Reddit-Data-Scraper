I\u2019m going to the campus, as well as to CSLB, to check things out before picking which university \u2026but I\u2019m really leaning towards here! \n\nAny particular aspects of the campus you think a prospective student should check out? I want to get a real look at what life is like for a (commuting) student (parking structures to department building locations, etc). I would love to hear how fellow Animal Science students enjoy the program as well!\n\nThanks broncos:)",

            "comment": "Congrats on getting accepted. I'm an Agriculture Science major and I had to take Animal classes for my major so I think I can give you some insight.\n\nI love working with the animals here. We only have cows, swine, goats, and sheep. No fowl unfortunately, but you still learn about them in lecture. This school is very hands on. \"Learn by doing\" but you probably already knew that lol. I don't think CSULB can give you the experience that CPP can in that sense. Although our student admin can suck sometimes, the college of Agriculture is very helpful to their students. \n\nIf you come visit CPP to check it out, as a commuter make sure to check out Lot M and Lot J. Those are the parking lots closest to your classes. While you're there, you can check out the beef unit right next to M lot and if you drive down University drive, you can turn into the swine and sheep unit. \n\nIf you decide to come here, be sure to take any Lecture classes with Professor Lily Nguyen. She is amazing. A lot of the professors at this school are usually professionals in the field. Prof. Nguyen is a veterinarian and she shares a lot of important information with us during her lectures. \n\nAs an AS major, you'll also get the opportunity to apply as a live-in student. That means you could live with the animals and take care of them with other students if you want to. A lot of the pre vet students here have jobs at clinics and stuff so this is a great place to make connections. \n\nFor the animal labs, you will have to vaccinate, castrate, clip, and more hands-on stuff. The animals are so sweet, so hopefully you enjoy working with them if you ever do!\n\nGood luck on everything! And congratulations on your acceptance to both schools. Let me know if you have any questions.",

I went to TAMU for masters after and I still love and miss CPP. \n\nI don\u2019t know if they are still doing this but they have a program where you can assist births and raise foals through the equestrian center and get your equine experience there. Vets here in Texas know that program and wish that TAMU did something like that. There is also clubs to get animal experience that you need for vet school. Congratulations and good luck!",

I would highly suggest you take a tour of the campus, it's the best way to get a quick tour of all the hot spots on campus as well as get to learn a little history about the campus. Make sure to mention to the tour guide that you are an Animal Science major. This helps them to personalize the tour by mentioning programs you can get involved, like Fowl Watch, and point out our campus' mini rain forest and reptile room.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2020 with an Animal Science degree and I\u2019m now finishing my 2nd year in vet school! If vet school is ultimately your goal, make it a focus to do as well as you can while you\u2019re at CPP because vet school is getting competitive to the point where it\u2019s completely ridiculous and unobtainable what they want these applicants to have at graduation, in my opinion. With that being said, a lot of schools really like grads from CPP\u2019s program because you really do get to do a lot of hands on stuff that other unis in the area just don\u2019t offer. \n\nI\u2019m going to give you some pros and cons as someone who also commuted every day while attending, and since I graduated 3 years ago please keep that in mind, but since I was in your position not too too long ago I figured i\u2019d share my experiences!\n\nPros: really cool, unique experiences you don\u2019t get at any other program in SoCal. During my time we had labs that required you to make a nutritional feeding plan for some cattle up at the ranch and execute it. We had labs where we went to dairy farms and did rectal exams on cows, and reproduction labs where we learned how to collect semen from boars. Foal watch is so cool, definitely recommend that. Wallace\u2019s parasitology course made me discover my love for all things pathogenic and creepy crawly in the vet world. Everything you learn really does set you up for success in vet school, and the experiences are unique for sure. \n\nCons: my major complaint was the admin staff during my time. Most of the professors were fantastic, but the actual people who you need help from to make sure you get your degree were awful. During the mandated meetings we had to have with them, I was talked down to, criticized, and told I should look into non vet fields because I wasn\u2019t cut out for it. Very disorganized, chaotic, and I\u2019d guess it hasn\u2019t gotten better since COVID. However, I navigated it as did all of my classmates and I\u2019m sure you can too. Just don\u2019t expect sunshine and rainbows when it comes to having to talk to admin, they really do not care about you in my experience. \n\nOverall, CPP\u2019s animal science program will absolutely prep you for vet school, and as long as you dedicate yourself, you\u2019ll be a really good applicant for vet school once you graduate. My unsolicited advice would be: get a job in an animal hospital as soon as you feasibly can, especially if you haven\u2019t worked in one before. This field is really difficult physically and mentally, and you need to see how it is first hand to make sure it\u2019s what you want to do. But I really wish you the best of luck!!

Although Ag is not be biggest college by number of students, it pretty much takes up most of the campus.  I'm a little bummed that you're primarily interested in touring the campus to see the parking structures.  Any chance you could live on campus?",

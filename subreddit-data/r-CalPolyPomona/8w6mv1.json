Mark was a Claremont Park Ranger for three years and a sixteen year veteran of the Cal Poly Pomona Campus Security team. Mark was tragically assaulted and killed while working his shift as a Public Safety Specialist at Cal Poly Pomona on Friday, June 29, 2018.\n\nMark was a friendly, helpful, and dedicated figure in the Claremont Wilderness Park and on the campus of Cal Poly Pomona. He will be greatly missed by his family, co-workers, and the community.\n\nWe extend our sincerest sympathy to his family. A community vigil will be held Thursday, July 5, 2018 at 5:00 pm at Lewis Park (1700 Danbury Road in Claremont)\n\nIf you missed out on anything, read the updates thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/8uzmhr/cpp_updates_re_murder_on_campus/)",

I don't have to take the GE anymore because I've completed it at City College, my concern is not having enough units to be full time so I was asking if I can add classes that I'm supposed to take in future semesters in order to fulfill full-time status.",

As long as you take them in order, you should be fine.  Make sure to talk to your counselor/advisor at the  CPP college of ENV or ARC department, I forgot which.  Link to the architecture courses towards the bottom of this page.\n\n[https://catalog.cpp.edu/content.php?catoid=61&amp;navoid=4885](https://catalog.cpp.edu/content.php?catoid=61&amp;navoid=4885)\n\nBTW, some transfers get placed in 1st or 2nd year, rarely 3rd depending on your portfolio.  If you get placed into 1st, you'll have even more time to fill.",

I will say that CPP has really stepped up their game with the Psychology job recruiters they're bringing to campus during the career fairs.\n\nPsi Chi is pretty chill and has a lot of cool people, they're probably the best resource here.\n\nSince this is a polytechnic school much of the focus goes towards the engineering, science, and business colleges.\n\nNot sure if anyone else faced this issue, but I barely had any classes with the tenured professors and much of my classes were taught by the part timers or grad students.\n\nA lot of Psych students see CPP as a stepping board for grad school.",

It\u2019s not ideal. often psych profs are paid to do research, so they don\u2019t primarily focus on lecturing. majority of my previous profs were part time or phd students. I roughly had 4 profs that were 10 year. \n\nIf you truly want to further your education with psychology, I wouldn\u2019t select cpp. However, that is just my opinion as a recent grad.",

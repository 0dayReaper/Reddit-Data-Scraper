Daily journals which is just based on our  opinion of what we  liked about the lecture, what we  thought was interesting. 4 presentations with an  assigned group, each person gets one slide. The last \u201cpresentation\u201d is by yourself, for this presentation she made it optional to present. \n\nI\u2019m not too sure if she changes things up, but she\u2019s just a sweet person.",

    "postText": "I know this is a weird question but I recently got accepted and am wondering about the carry laws. I always carry a leatherman or a knife with me (except on high school campus of course) and am wondering about the laws regarding blade length, action, or whether I can carry one on campus at all. I have done a bit of research but have gotten mixed results, some saying any weapon being carried is a felony while others say a blade less than 2.5 inches is fine. \n\nIf anyone has any experience on this matter, their insight would be much appreciated.",

I am concerned on the people here who say your a clown for wanting to defend yourself. I mean someone was held at knife point and another was at gunpoint. Security sucks as well so I think the real clowns are those who question your concern for security. Although I do know some people who carry a knife anyways because they are here super late at night. Just be smart with whatever you do.",

As long as you don't treat a knife as a weapon, most people don't care; if you carry a knife for convenience, keep doing it.\n\nJust use common sense please. A 3\" bladed Leatherman or Spyderco probably won't scare anyone but an Espada XL most definitely will",

But it was in my pocket and I\u2019ve also pulled it out a few times to cut things for prof/friends. No one was ever worried. I\u2019m not carrying for defense reasons. Only have a blade on me if I had class after work which I carry a blade for. You carry the risk of getting a fine. But no one really enforces. And I mean it\u2019s not like your caring a 5 inch blade or a sword. That would be stupid. But it\u2019s at your own risk. Rules are not to have a blade. It\u2019s like speeding, how often do you get tickets? Prob not often for most people. It\u2019s illegal to speed, but you can if you want, but you have to deal with the consequences if you get caught.",

This arrest is based on any presence of a weapon on a school campus that has the capacity of serious bodily harm.\n\nOther campuses specify both penal codes, but just because they don\u2019t cite both doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not still a rule.",

It probably wouldn't be very useful for self-defense in a pinch anyway.  For that I carry Sabre Red pepper spray gel, mostly for the parking lot late at night.  The weapons policy is from CA penal code 626.9 which basically says that you can't bring any weapons onto school grounds such as firearms, knives over 2.5 inches or that have two sharp sides or quick deploying action such as butterfly knives and switch blades.  Pretty much all other weapons designed to inflict harm that aren't explicitly designed for self-defense only are illegal, so no Bowie knives, brass knuckles, nunchaku, baseball bats, or any other ninja turtle weapons.",

To those discussing knife use specifically for self defense, while it's better than dying the courts will not look fondly on you even if you were defending yourself if you use a knife. It's extremely messy and even if you're in the right jurys will hate looking at the aftermath. Carry pepper spray instead, I know it sounds lame but there's not really much better you can do on a college campus and it'll definitely ruin some attackers day if the need arises.",

I can say I\u2019ve been visibly carrying and occasionally using a folder on campus when needed (including right in front of staff) for a long time. IMHO the key is to look confident, unapologetic, and not be weird about it. Like don\u2019t use it for stupid shit just to show off your knife. But make a decision and stand by it. With that said I can think of many better things for self defense that are less legally ambiguous. Like a flashlight with a finger ring or spray. But I use a knife :)",

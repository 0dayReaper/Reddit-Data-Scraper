    "postText": "I was recently admitted for transfer. I am thinking about double majoring. I checked the cpp website and couldn't find much info and wanted to ask: What can I double major in ? I imagine there is probably some requirements and restrictions to what I can double major in. Is it even possible to declare double major as a transfer?",

            "comment": "Definitely depends. Usually, cpp will say no, they aren't big on double majoring, but if your program is closely related to another major, then it's possible. Here's an example: Computer and electrical engineering are two different majors, but they are so similar to one another that it is possible to double major. You would only need to take certain classes to do it. But you still need an advisor to approve it regardless of how similar both majors are to one another. Can't double major in something completely unrelated to your original major you got accepted to if that makes sense. Basically, you can't major in theater and computer science. The school will make you choose one or the other. But if your major is closely related, such as computer and electrical engineering, you would need approval from your advisor, and then you can.",

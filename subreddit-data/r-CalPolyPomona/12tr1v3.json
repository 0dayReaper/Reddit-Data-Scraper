    "postText": "Hi! I have been admitted to CPP for CS and will be become a future Bronco. I have some questions about the major, and especially about the teachers. I have dwelled in this subreddit for the past month and have been researching how it is to get a feel of what I will do here. Despite all of this, I still have some questions about CS. \n\nCurrently, I have seen a variety of comments; some comments were positive and some negative. I have seen positive opinions on the major but they, of course, always state that it always \u201ccomes down to what you do,\u201d in terms of extracurriculars. But there are also some negative comments that do create some concerns for me. Some were about the classes themselves and how they don\u2019t really teach in-depth and that the curriculum itself is quite outdated. I\u2019ve also seen someone talk about a curriculum change and how it isn\u2019t favorable to incoming students. And finally one comment about how the major mains Java. Most of these comments are somewhat old and some even pre-pandemic. Has any of this changed or has it stayed relatively the same? \n\nMy other concern is about the professors. Some of the negative opinions were about some professors and how they do not really care about what they are teaching or even care if the student understands the topics or not. I know that bad professors are not a rare thing considering I have had my fair share of bad teachers during High School. Again, these comments were somewhat old and I want to know if this pool of professors has dwindled down. And just in case, is there a way to choose my professor? If not, is there a known list of these type of professors so that I can at least brace myself for whats to come.",

            "comment": "For starters, my condolences. I'm the one that ranted about the curriculum change (occurred mid-pandemic and has persisted). It's omitting some important math that, depending on your career interests (data science, research), may leave you a half-step behind. \n\nAt the end of the day, any CS program you attend will be what you make of it, be it MIT or CPP. We are not as \"learn by doing\" as you may experience in an engineering program. A CS degree is not the same as Software Engineering prep, if that's your career path, no matter where you go so be ready to bridge the difference in skillsets on your own time via clubs and personal projects.\n\nProfessor quality is still, with some exceptions, subpar. As it is with all college courses, you select which class sections you enroll in (and in turn you choose your professor). Sometimes, a course you're looking at will only have bad professors, bad times, or professor TBA -- you'll have to weigh the value of having a \"better\" professor vs delaying taking the course for the semester (or in the case of an elective, not taking it).\n\nI highly recommend you join the CPP CS discord and take a look at cppscheduler and ratemyprofessor to get a feel for professor quality. A group of students ont the discord also just released BroncoDirectMe - a chrome extension to help integrate student feedback and RMP data to the class enrollment process.",

Given it's underlying role in the field, you can arguably find a place for it no matter the field... just the impact of its absence will vary.",

            "comment": "The average age of these professors is like 64, they have been and will continue to be out of the industry and most read off of slides. Its up to you to take initiative to make and explore CS on your own time outside of these courses. Personality wise they are pleasant but most material can be googled or self taught. My best advice to you is try and find any way to get priority because if you don't good luck even finding classes to take as a CS student. As for good professors if you get lucky you will learn and get a good grade. Some teach and fail you and you are left confused about what even happened in the semester. Most fall into not really teaching well.",

Your first \u201ccoding\u201d class would be CS 1400 I think and they do teach Java there but I\u2019ve also heard that the curriculum uses C++ and you can have a python elective. As for as professors go some have bad reputations and you can join discords and ask around but if all fails rate my professor is your best friend. That\u2019s all I can really offer I\u2019m pretty new here too so hopefully some upper classmen can give you more insight.",

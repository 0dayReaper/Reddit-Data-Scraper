    "postText": "This is a total shot in the dark, but I figured since its the end of the year I'd throw out a post and hope for a hail mary moment. I've lost a black samsung tablet with a black case and a black stylus attached to it. IF you open it up, theres a fantastic four lockscreen, or a star wars lock screen. I dont remember if they were different but if you got in to the home screen its a fantastic four wallpaper. Literally has 2 years worth of engineering notes. I have no idea where I left it. Could be either:\n\n\\- Engineering Building\n\n\\- Library\n\n\\-English Building\n\n\\-Some other fucking place lol.\n\nAnyways, if someone ever finds it or has found it and totally factory reset it or somehow its just hasnt been used, please return it lol. I'd really like it back.",

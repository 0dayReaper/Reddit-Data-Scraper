I have my resume ready (its pretty light though). How should I dress? How hard is it to land an internship or experience opportunity at one of those?",

Your competing with a bunch of other people as well.\n\nAt a career fair it's a lot easier to land an interview since your face to face with a recruiter and your handing them your resume instead of sending your resume in the abyss when applying online. \n\nThere's a ton of things to check off before you even think of landing an interview. \n\nStrong resume, projects, work experience. \n\nHow you dress, your pitch, your attitude is going to be a big play in a Career fair. \n\nBest bet outside of a career fair is using your network to get a referral towards a job and doing good in the interview.",

I personally feel like the class is fairly easy since a lot of the concepts are the same from STA1200, but a lot of people in my class do seem to be struggling since our averages for both midterms were in the low 70s and  people complain about the class on discord\u2026 if you can learn at a fast pace I think you\u2019ll be fine \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

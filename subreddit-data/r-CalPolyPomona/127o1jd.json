I was given the opportunity to take my alternate major of Urban Planning instead of Architecture.\n\nI checked the website and apparently I can only switch majors after a year, but I was wondering if there was a way I could ask CPP to switch now?\n\nI know that architecture is an impacted major, so it might be a reach \u2014 but I just want to know if there is that option out there.",

Architecture doesn't take lower-division changes of major ([https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/guides/changeofmajor/requirements.shtml](https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/guides/changeofmajor/requirements.shtml)), so you would have to wait until you're at least a junior and then start in first-year coursework.",

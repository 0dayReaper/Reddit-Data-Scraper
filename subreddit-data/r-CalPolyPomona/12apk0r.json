            "comment": "I transferred here last year so let me give u some of my insight. I was too considering on campus vs. off-campus housing. It's little long so be ready to read but it's great info. \n\n If u decided to live on campus, look into the university village, u pay ur rent monthly, as compare to all at once like the other housing on campus like the hallsn or the suites and it's right outside of campus. The single room  will run u $1026 with utilities, water, wifi, and everything included. We literally have the AC and the lights on 24/7. Double room is about 900 I believe (not 100% sure). The laundry is free. We have a swimming pool. Village does some cute events every other week. Overall, it was a great experience. I already signed up for next year. You don't need a car to go to class since the Bronco shuttle stops at the village. One important part about the village that's different from the other on campus housing is its considered off campus housing even tho it is on campus, so you are not required to buy the $2000 meal plans (where you are stuck with bunch of centerpointe meals, they are not bad but imagine eating the same thing everyday which is not nice). You can of course cook urself but I just ended up loading my bronco card with about $1000 broncobucks where I can get any food on campus including Starbucks. People who live in the village gets $30 in meal points every month. (innovation brew works aka closest and tasty option across the street from the village, takes meal point so you can use ur points there). So basically ur rent is like $996 (if u count the $30 meal point as a discount \ud83d\ude05) and u can go to the BRIC anytime (BRIC is CPP gym and its free for students). \n\nNow let's talk about off campus housing. Off campus housing prices does go up and down depending on location, whether u decide to have roommate or the whole apartment to urself. I was looking at studio apartment in the pomona area last year when deciding where to live. Prices ranged from $900 to $2000. But remember u have to pay utilities, water, even the hassle of having to get wifi, etc. Also remember u will have to drive to class so finding parking (especially during peak hours) can be annoying and gas prices going up too. Also one other thing is most apartment won't come furnished expect some basic kitchen appliances so that means u will have to buy ur bed, etc. Also a lot of apartments will require like 1 or 2 month of rent in advance when signing the lease and I don't know the specifics of canceling. \n\nConclusion: I will say personally in my opinion, village on campus is a better choice as it open 365 days unlike some of the other on campus housing where you have to leave, I thinking during breaks. But this doesn't mean don't look for housing off campus. Just remember cost of each. And do some basic calculation and choose for urself. When I did the calculations for myself last year, village was the better option for me.",

            "comment": "Hey, I transferred here a while ago, here's my take as I lived on campus and now live off campus- Living on campus lets you use campus resources waaaay more frequently, since its only a short walk away from even the furthest of suites, and it helps with getting to know ppl on campus. Also having time gaps between classes isn't too bad nice you can just head back to your room and relax without worrying about traffic or parking.\n\nCons are that ultimately its university housing, so there's rules and what not that you've got to follow, and the quality of the stuff (chairs, sofas, stove, etc) given to you isn't that great. Also, your roommates/neighbors will probably be random and a decent chance of them not being nice/considerate people unfortunately.\n\nLiving off campus is somewhat cheaper, although when you factor in the resources and food costs it may be about the same, possibly even more. I currently pay just over $13k a year for my  share of the house I live in with my roommates, and have to worry about traffic and parking every day when I go to class. However, having that freedom to doing quite literally whatever the hell I want without the housing rules or worrying about RAs breathing down my neck is pretty nice.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions!",

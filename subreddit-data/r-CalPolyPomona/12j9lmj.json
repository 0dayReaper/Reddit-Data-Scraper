    "postText": "I've been looking into the B.Arch program at CPP and feel both excitement and abject terror. On the one hand, I'm insanely excited to take part in one of the best architecture programs in the country. The NAAB accreditation is impressive, and from what I've heard the job prospects post-CPP is stellar. I picked CPP over UCSD Urban Studies &amp; Planning (it looks like someone else posted abt the same situation here too lolol) but I do have a few reservations and questions about the workload.\n\nThe way it's described is a bit hellish, with someone mentioning a 40hr/week in-studio and most heading to bed between 1-3am. Also, the fact that the incoming class of 150-200 gets whittled down to 70-80 by the 3rd year is just terrifying.\n\nI'm wondering if any current B.Arch students have tips or guidance on how to succeed and not implode. I have a few specific questions too:\n\n\\- What does a typical weekday look like for a 1st year (or any year for that matter) architecture student?\n\n\\- how much free-time does a typical B.Arch student get on weekdays (is there usually time to get food, hang out w/ friends, do clubs, etc.)?\n\n\\- Given how different the program is from the HS learning structure, what does preparing for tests/finals look like?",

            "comment": "Current first year here. Welcome to Architecture here at at CPP!! Always happy to see new people coming into architecture!\n\nIt is true that the work here is very intensive. I\u2019ve had trouble trying to find my footing a couple of times but I got the hang of it after awhile. Although I may not have as much experience as the upper class men I\u2019ll try to answer your questions as best as I can.\n\n\u2022 My typical work week mainly consists of work. Currently my only GE class is physics so most of the time I am doing work for my architecture studio. I find out that I work best when I\u2019m alone so that there are no distractions. Some people find it easier to work with others though so I guess it varies between person to person, just make sure that you get your work done\n\n\u2022 I usually get some free time towards the end of the day as I\u2019m finishing up my work by then. I make an effort to always give myself some relax time during Fridays though so that I can see some friends who aren\u2019t in architecture. I typically go to sleep by either 12-1am (I try to never go past that).   \n\nThere should be enough time in between classes to get food. The only in-person class that I have for architecture would be for studio which is only on two specific days so sometimes I\u2019ll just get food meanwhile I\u2019m in a zoom call\n\nI don\u2019t do any clubs but I know a person who does tennis at our school who is also in architecture so it\u2019s definitely possible, you just gotta know how to manage your time well.\n\n\u2022 from what I experienced we don\u2019t really have \u201ctests\u201d for architecture. We have a final review for studio in which everyone presents their finalized project that we\u2019ve worked on for the semester and there will be a board of architects that will give you tips on how to improve your project in the future. However, how we are reviews didn\u2019t reflect upon our grade. We do have final projects for other classes but no like \u201csit down on a desk and select the correct answer\u201d type test. That is from what I experienced so take that with a grain of salt. \n\nIt is pretty hectic towards the end of the semester since that\u2019s when everyone is trying to get stuff done and everyone is nervous but just remember you ain\u2019t alone.\n\n\nTips:\n\n- get a hard drive (1TB should last you for awhile)\n\n- MANAGE YOUR TIME! I can\u2019t stress this enough, you will have to prioritize your work a lot. Oftentimes the work that the professors give us is highly unreasonable and at times it can feel like busy work. But, it is definitely doable. You don\u2019t want to get stuck doing all nighters.\n\nSome people like to glorify that they\u2019ve spent \u201cx\u201d amount of hours sleeping or how the just did an all nighter and I really do not think that they are necessary. There is a point where you are just too tired to get your work done and usually it\u2019s just best to just go to bed, wake up early in the morning to get it finished. Prioritize sleep. If you prioritize doing your work on time and getting it done then there shouldn\u2019t be any reason for you to not sleep\n\n- Get to know the people in your studio this will help you out in the future whenever you are stuck. I\u2019m a pretty introverted person but I still know quite a bit of people to the point where I know where I can go to for help. Talk to your professors as well they can give very good advice to better your projects. \n\n- don\u2019t forget to give yourself some relax time as well. It can get really stressful and if you don\u2019t give yourself some time to rest you will get burnt out really quickly; take care of yourself.\n\nThat\u2019s about all I have to say. Really all it comes down to is just trying to find what the best way it is for you to get through all this architecture stuff. Trying to find your footing in all of this mess can be very frustrating and hard. You\u2019ll mess up a couple of times and that\u2019s okay, just as long as you get back up and continue to move forward. \n\nI know that architecture is tough but if you have a true passion for it then stick with it. However it is true that it is not for everyone, there have been a couple that have dropped out of architecture and I know a couple of people that are going to drop It\u2019s just because they\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s not for them.\n\nAll in all, going here has been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made and although I have had my down moments, I\u2019ve had some of the best and most memorable moments in just my first year. Enjoy the first couple of weeks in college and remember to have fun. It\u2019s a new experience so make sure you live every second of it.\n\nGood luck in your final days of high school! Congrats again on getting into architecture!!",

                            "comment": "The experience of the Professor will sometimes depend on the student and their point of view. From my experience the first year professors changed a little bit but the majority of the first year professors stayed the same.\n\nFor my first semester I had Professor Robert Alexander (a.k.a Bob). Btw we refer to the teachers by their first name so I\u2019ll refer to their first names as I\u2019m talking about them. Professor Bob is actually a very good professor, if you\u2019re not a first year. I feel like I would have a lot more engaging conversations with him if I had more of a sophisticated knowledge of architecture, and it is for that reason why I will probably be taking him again later down the line. Taking him as a first year is kind of a double edged sword. He is a very intelligent person and his advice on projects can be very helpful! However, as a first year you\u2019ll likely not really understand anything about the concepts of architecture whereas he has a mastery of those concepts. Because of this, his advice can be sometimes very ambiguous and not specific. He would offer more specific advice if you asked though. Make sure that you do the work and bring in all the deliverables on studio days. He can get pretty frustrated if you decide to be lazy and not bring in anything. If you show that you are diligently working then he will be very patient with you. Overall I think he is a great guy I had a pretty good experience with him as my professor. Although you\u2019d probably get a better experience if you were probably a 4th or 5th year.\n\nCurrently, I am taking Claudia as my studio professor and despite the bad rep that she receives she is actually a pretty good studio professor. She will challenge you to make your own design choices and hasn\u2019t (for me at least) discouraged an idea for a project that I had. She will point out issues that might come up with that idea but she would still allow me to go with that option if I wanted to. She actually has a pretty good point of view on architecture and that makes for pretty good studio discussion. But again, make sure that you do the work. This is both for you and for professors. You want to get the most advice for your project, how are you gonna do that when you have no work to provide, y\u2019know? I can understand where other people are coming from when they say that she can be either very stern pr snarky. I think she might\u2019ve toned down this semester because of the reputation that she had received the previous semester. But all in all, I would recommend taking her if you\u2019d want. (That\u2019s just from my experience I recommend asking other people if you can)\n\nI can offer minimal advice to the other first year professors since I haven\u2019t taken them but I\u2019ll say what I can.\n\nSona is I hear a very good professor, but a very strict one, taking her will be a challenge.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that Professors Behn and Ever are pretty easy going and nice professors.\n\nAndrew (from the one week that I had with him before I switched to Claudia) was a really chill professor. People recommend that I\u2019d take him. That goes the same for Professor Sasha as well.\n\nThat\u2019s all that I can really say about the professors.  I\u2019m not gonna tell you which ones to avoid because that opinion will differ based on the type of student, their work ethic, and the point of view. So in conclusion, take which ever Professor and then figure it out from there. There is an add drop period so if you don\u2019t like that Professor within the first weeks of school then you can switch to a different professor.\n\nHope that helps :)",

(i would definitely recommend getting an on campus job if you need to get one).\n\nas far as the class size going down, we started with 147 students this year and we now have 112. that will probably go down to 100 in by the start of fall. however, not a single person that i know who switched out of the major or dropped out of school was actually failing, they just decided it was too much time and they didn\u2019t feel like it was right for them. the professors all want you to pass! (except maybe claudia)\n\nfor professors for first year i had sona for first semester and mitchell for second semester, both of which i absolutely recommend. sona is strict but kind and truly wants to help you learn. mitchell is a caring man who is very flexible with any situations that come up in your personal life. \n\ni don\u2019t recommend behn or claudia.\n\nbehn because some people that i know who took behn first semester were super far behind in skills second semester. he\u2019s chill, and if you want an easy semester he might be enticing, but beware of falling behind. for a more lax professor who will keep you up to date in skills i would choose ever vargas. \n\nclaudia is just mean honestly. she\u2018s made people cry and patronizes people for asking questions. some people say that it\u2019s worth it because you learn a lot from her, but honestly i\u2019d avoid her.\n\nbob, ever, sasha, and drew are all nice and i\u2019ve heard good things, just haven\u2019t taken them myself.",

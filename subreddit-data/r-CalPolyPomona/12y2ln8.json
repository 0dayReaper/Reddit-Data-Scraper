Take this time to become your own person, I know that may be hard to understand for clingy, controlling, or manipulative parents, but the sooner you stand up the easier it'll become. \n\nBack when I started I didn't know any better and thought that I'd need to bring my dad along so we could explain that I have ADHD and learning disabilities when talking to counselors for class enrollment. \n\nLo and behold it turns out at the end of orientation you just sit on a computer and select your classes. I later found out that I needed to go to the DRC and get an intake appointment.",

I didn\u2019t pay extra $70, cause my parents go to Starbuck on campus and chill over there. And they\u2019re gonna separate students and their parents to 2 different group( it doesn\u2019t matter if u go with your parents or not ,since u have your own time to talk and make friends with others)\nFor my orientation day, i did see a lot of ppl go with their parents:))) including me. Cause it\u2019s so sad if I just go to new school without knowing anybody:(\n\nIf u pay $70 so the school will cover lunch for your parents",

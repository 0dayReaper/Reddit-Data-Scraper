I would also say printing out your resume would be a help, as well as having your LinkedIn on hand. Additionally, keep in mind that the recruiters there will have talked to hundreds of people, and there's tons of competition- don't feel discouraged or defeated if you don't have enough time to make the connections you wannt!",

A basic conversation can sometimes gauge how the job and work environment is.\n\nAs much as the saying \"beggars can't be choosers\" is overused, most definitely talk to everyone related to your career field. Making a good impression with a recruiter may be the first step to getting a foot in the door.",

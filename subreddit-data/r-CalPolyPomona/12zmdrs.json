I am confused.\n\nI was doing research on the program and mistaken this program with the other Cal Poly's prgram :((( I am not sure if I want to get into the Visual Communication Design program anymore :(( but I have also paid the administration fee.",

Essentially the same thing, except you can focus the major as to your area of interests at the workshop level. Email the chair if you want to meet one on one to discuss the program. awacock @ cpp.edu. If you don\u2019t end up with us, just make sure you land in a BFA program and not a BA or BS program. If youre local swing by this Saturday to the Kellogg gallery to see the senior exhibition poly-kroma ( www.poly-kroma.com ) or stop by Monday for the 2d3d+ exhibition. Both at the Kellogg gallery. Best of luck in finding the right program for you.",

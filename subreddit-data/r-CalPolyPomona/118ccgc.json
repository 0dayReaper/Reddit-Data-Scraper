    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nI'm a CS major who's transferring to a four year in the fall. So far I've been accepted to CSULB, but if I'm admitted I'd much rather go to Cal Poly Pomona. Right now I am taking a Discrete Math class which is my last major requirement (per [assist.org/](https://assist.org/))  that I wanted to knock out before transferring. However, I am considering dropping because my class is during the day and I need to find a job. \n\nHas any CS major been admitted to Cal Poly Pomona without having taken Discrete Math?",

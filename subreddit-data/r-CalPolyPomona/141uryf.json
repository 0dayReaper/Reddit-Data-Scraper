Of the classes that do require textbooks, but NOT connect/etc, try to find them online (libgen is my best friend).\n\n\nAfter that, see if the price is worth it or not\n\n\n____________________________\n\nA few professors opt out of Instant Access for their classes since it's not required too. A lot of times instant access pay per class price wanted way less than the $250 subscription price",

Welcome to CPP :)\n\n\nAlso now that I think of it, Connects pay per class was about 100-150 per semester on average for me. But I'm also a CIS student, so our upper division classes were mostly project based/on Canvas(free) instead of programs like Connect",

ALL classes will be required to participate, unlike the previous Instant Access program. IF the book/online homework platform/reader is required, it has to be covered. 3. If you opt out, you opt out of ALL your materials and have to acquire what you need individually. You'll have to do the math to see whether IAC works for you or not compared to buying/renting a la carte, but we'll have the price comparison information for each class/item on our Compare website to assist with that calculation.",

The only thing is if you do wanna lift at peak times which is usually weekdays from like 2-8 pm, the weight lifting areas are pretty packed. The ASICPP app also has something called the crowd meter where you can see how many people are using each area at a time. The workers walk around every 10 minutes or so and update the app with how crowded everything is.",

            "comment": "The gym is pretty nice and a decent size, but not well maintained. The cables on the machines need to be lubricated, and some of the equipment is pretty low quality (basically the Technogym machines). The showers have stuff growing on the doors, curtains, and floors, and most of the lockers need to be paid for; the staff also disable a good portion of the free-to-use lockers on the sides to try to get people to pay for the red ones in the middle. The adjustable benches are way too small, and the pop pins for adjusting the angle are too short; I witnessed one collapsing from a flat position into a decline position while a girl was pressing. \n\nI think the facility is more enjoyable for powerlifters and weightlifters since there are a decent amount of racks and designated platforms, although I think it\u2019s crazy to have free weights on the upper level. It may not be as enjoyable if you\u2019re heavily into bodybuilding, since it lacks effective machines like chest-supported rows\n\nAll that being said, you get a lot of value for how little the school charges you for the membership; you will not find facilities like this at such a low rate outside of colleges. Go before 11am and between 1 and 3pm if you want to avoid the crazy rush hours",

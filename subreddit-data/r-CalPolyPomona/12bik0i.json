    "postText": "I had a mental breakdown and ended up not going to class, so I know my grades are solid F's/W's, but it's only two of them. I am a senior (I'll be a super senior because I still have 1 more year of 11 classes) and my current GPA is 3.58 or 3.7, I don't really remember. After this semester is over, I will have two F's. Do you guys know how badly that will impact my GPA?  What's done is done, and I'll know after the semester, but I'd rather figure it out now.",

Explain to them your situation and how you no longer can maintain theses courses due to your mental health. If you have proof such as a doctors note or any documentation that you suffer from mental heath. Provide them with much documentation when meeting with the chair. \n\n\nI was in a similar situation where I had to request for a withdrawal. I met with my department chair,explained  to them my situation, they said yes but I would need to show sometime of proof which I did. Since it was already known by the chair it was approved in a couple of days.",

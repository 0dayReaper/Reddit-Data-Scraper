Only assignment was to make your own archery game and print your own targets for said game at the end of the semester. Besides that, just show up and shoot. Barbara was also the advisor for the archery club (she probably still is if she still teaches), which I was not a member of. Archery class provides old recurve bows with arrows for free (plus armguards and finger tabs). Archery club does not provide anything afaik. This was all pre-pandemic so things may have changed. Lmk if you wanted to know anything else.",

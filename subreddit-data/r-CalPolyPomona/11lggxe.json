I also need good wifi (and an outlet).\n\nI would reserve a study room in the library, but the wifi in the library is usually so bad that I don't trust it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any places on campus that fit my needs?\n\n(My interviews will be from 9am to 10am if that makes a difference) (Ideally somewhere within 10 min walking distance of building 8)",

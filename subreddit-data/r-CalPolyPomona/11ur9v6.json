My plan is to go to law school and major in Political Science for my undergrad.  Right now my choices are Chico, San Jose, Community College, or Pomona.  Of those choices I like Pomona the most but don\u2019t know exactly how good their political science department is and knowing that Pomona has an engineering focus is kinda making me think about going the CC route.  If anyone with reasonable knowledge could enlighten me that would be very helpful",

I would recommend the cc route, because I also feel like poli sci jobs might be heavily dependent on connections + school prestige and getting into a better school is much easier after going through cc. Good luck!",

I\u2019m not gonna suggest anything or tell you what I think you should/shouldn\u2019t do, I\u2019m just going to tell to you my honest thoughts of the poli-sci department at CPP and you can do with it what you will. \n\nWhile we aren\u2019t known or ranked for having a good poli sci department, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s been excellent. Every class I\u2019ve taken, apart from one, has had highly educated, passionate professors that care about their subject and want to help you succeed and thrive in every way they can. We have no shortage of political science classes, and I feel that our professors, for the most part, have done very well at being ambiguous about their own beliefs, so as not to muddle or influence the information they\u2019re teaching",

I\u2019m a poli sci major comms minor alum - I know successful, practicing lawyers and Hill staffers that came out of my grad class or near it. And that says something, I\u2019m less than 10 years post-grad.\n\nThat being said, I did a left turn after college and chose not to attend Law school (the beckoning of a stable salary was too much against the 100-200K cost of a top 15 JD program) and I\u2019d say my classmates who did the same have faired well - even outside of law/ politics! \n\nTotally your choice if you go the CC to maybe UC/ high ranked school option vs. Pomona. Success isn\u2019t 100% defined by where you go - it\u2019s what you do with your education. I know UC grads struggling and CC grads thriving owning their own businesses. Just gotta do what works for you!",

            "comment": "Poli-Sci is offered at almost any university.  Your experience will depend on how well you choose your instructors at any given program.  It's also a broad enough subject that a lot will depend on your own initiative throughout your life and career.  That said, I would choose based on your preferred \"college experience\".  Chico is a nice college town though very isolated. SJSU is very urban, close to culture but maybe a bit to \"dingy\" for many.  CC is very affordable.  CPP is a rural gem in the middle of a huge metropolis.",

I was in your shoes once, and I don\u2019t regret choosing CPP \u2014 when I applied, I saw they had the best polisci department from the CSUs (this couldve changed now) but all the professors (except one who was very rude and ableist) have been nothing but a joy. You can easily get close to them and they\u2019ll definitely help you get a letter of rec for grad school or help with research opportunities. They\u2019re very open minded and are helpful towards any student who is going through difficult times. I hope this helped :)",

            "comment": "In my experience the political science department at cpp has been great, the department is always sending out emails about different opportunities for poli sci majors such as internships, fellowships, job opportunities, law school panels, etc. The professors (in my experience) have always been very helpful and try to help students to the best of their abilities and have been really easy to get along with. They definitely want you to succeed and will help you in any way they can. If ur interested in law school ik they offer different clubs and programs that can help you make connections, specifically the Judicial Internship where u basically go to the Pomona courthouse 2x a week and observe court cases, meet judges, attorneys and other people in the legal field! I transferred from a cc to cpp and although i\u2019m glad i was able to save myself the money I wish I had more time to explore the clubs and programs they offer. A couple cons to the poli sci department at cpp tho are: \n1. not enough class section times available especially for upper division courses so more likely than not you\u2019ll have class Mon-Thurs. Ex: PLS:3821 only available M/W @7:00pm during winter or spring semester \n2. In order to graduate either have to do a thesis (30-40 pages) or an internship &amp; also write a ~20 page paper senior year \n3. probably more but can\u2019t think of any off the top of my head",

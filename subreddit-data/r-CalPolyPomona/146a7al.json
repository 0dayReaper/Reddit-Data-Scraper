    "postText": "Hey guys, so just like the title, how long has it taken some of you guys to have your graduation status to appear on your transcripts. I just graduated in May and I knew it would take a bit of time but registrar told me anywhere from now until August. If anyone has already received an email notification about it could you write a comment below? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s done by degree/ college or last name. I\u2019m only concerned because I\u2019m trying to get hired for a job but they can\u2019t consider me until they have my full transcripts with everything on it, even though they know I graduated.",

    "postText": "I got admitted into cal poly Pomona for fall 2023 as a computer engineer. Before attending there, I wanted to know how the student life and study life (from a students perspective). Is the school well diverse and cares about the students? Activities to do? Programs? Resource officers? Internships? Basically any and all info would be appreciated. Keep in mind, I want personal experience from students, not those biased online articles.",

            "comment": "I can say confidently it is quite a diverse school, just google the demographics. A lot of students are commuters and come to campus solely for class which causes there to not be a ton of campus life. There are certainly plenty of clubs ranging from academic focused to fun activities and a decent amount of greek life although all greek houses are off campus. Student wise, most are kind and not pretentious - a lot come from humble backgrounds. If you are dorming your first year making friends will be easy the first few weeks while everyone is also trying to do that.\nI'd say that student resources are wildly available, there are plenty of tutoring and office hours for all courses. Although professors certainly vary with how organized and how much support they are willing to provide.\nInternship and career wise there are several career fairs and other career oriented events each year which are important to take advantage of. The Career Center also provides free formal clothing like dress shirts at certain points of the year.\nIf I had to provide a piece of advice, I'd say to make sure you sign up for classes as soon as you are able to, CPP is notorious for having classes get filled and you'll find yourself having to wait a semester or more to get the class you need. Summer classes are a good backup if you find yourself stuck in that position.\n\nBest of luck and have fun!\n\n-2021 CPP Alumni",

            "comment": "Compared to the \"other\" Cal Poly, CPP is incredibly diverse from ethnic as well as socio-economic perspectives. As someone who has lived in both SLO and Pomona, I personally found the people of Pomona to be much more down-to-earth and less judgmental. But maybe I'm just not \"one of them.\"\n\nThe school definitely cares about students, but it is a lower-cost school and probably doesn't get as much resources or support for students as a higher-funded university. \n\nLots of clubs, sports, and extracurricular activities. In computer engineering, as well as with your neighbors in comp sci and your friends over at the College of Business Administration studying Computer Information Systems, there are some fantastic academic organizations and collegiate competitions to pursue your professional interests. \n\nLet me give you a piece of advice that a CBA professor gave me when I was trying to decide which university to attend:\n\n&gt; **It doesn't really matter which university you attend** - What matters is that you go, and *what you do with it*. \n\nThe biggest variable isn't the campus or its funding or its community - it's *your level of effort* and *your dedication to achieving your goals*. \n\nSource: CBA CIS grad 2019, President emeritus of a student club, competitor in international collegiate cybersecurity competitions",

            "comment": "Quite diverse my GF went to SLO and when I would go over it would feel like it was 80% rich white kids in Pomona there is a wildly high diversity rate that I loved since I grew up in a mostly white town. It\u2019s a lot more laid back too. What\u2019s also nice about Pomona for people in Stem is fairly easy access to top engineering companies a drive away that you can intern at. I was able to intern at JPL in the school year and I know others that have as well and in defense companies. I studied CS and there are also a good amount of tech companies around.",

I know SLO has the name/prestige, but he's hoping to get an internship at JPL like you did. He likes the idea of CPP being more diverse but he's introverted and worried about making friends. He does plan on joining clubs. Any advice? TIA!",

I won\u2019t harp on about that but I wanted to add you\u2019re around lots of places with great food lol. I lived on campus for two years and my friends who were off campus would stay late and we\u2019d go to diamond bar, chino hills, Claremont, city of industry, etc for awesome food.",

            "comment": "The College of Engineering gets a lot of support, since it\u2019s one of colleges at CPP that is looked at by a lot of people; it certainly helps to be in clubs and active in any way whether it be campus jobs or just exploring what the campus has to offer, since that\u2019s how you\u2019ll be able to discover the many resources that some students here don\u2019t know about. There are many cultural centers and scholarships available that are specific to your position. That being said, a lot of people emphasize that your effort too will contribute to what you discover. It\u2019s nice to look around and talk to others to learn more about what the school has, but if you don\u2019t do those steps in the first place, then you would never know",

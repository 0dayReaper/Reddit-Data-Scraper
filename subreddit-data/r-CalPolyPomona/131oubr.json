    "postText": "I\u2019m a transferring Biology major. How bad do the bio classes get and the major as a whole? And, can I still graduate with Ds as long as my GPA is above 2.0?\n I\u2019m starting to feel over whelmed and I currently only have a Bio-2 Plants/animals course at mt. sac and it\u2019s taking all of my time and energy just to scratch the surface of a C. \nI don\u2019t care about getting Ds, but it would definitely make me a lot less stressed knowing Ds in fact can get degrees lol.",

            "comment": "I'll be honest, I think you ought to switch majors. If your attitude midway through your *intro* biology courses is \"D's get degrees\" (they do not, in fact), you're not going to survive the major here. Even then, no one is going to hire you for a lab job or field work if you can't manage to get above a C in your core classes.\n\nI teach the basic microbiology lab, and the students I've seen with your mentality usually switch out pretty quickly.",

I transferred to CPP last fall and personally haven\u2019t had any trouble registering for any of my bio classes. The major as a whole isn\u2019t too difficult I would say but that\u2019s just me. So far the hardest class I\u2019ve taken in bio 3220. I still need to take a few 4000 classes so maybe that might change my view on my hardest class.",

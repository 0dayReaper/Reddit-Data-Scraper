    "postText": "Does anyone know what civil engineering is like at CalPoly Pomona? I got accepted to SDSU and CalPoly Pomona but I don't know which one to choose because I don't know much about the schools (I just got here in America). I heard both are great but CalPoly is better in engineering. I live in San Diego so that's why I'm considering SDSU. I want to know both academic and social life, like which one is better overall?",

Personally if your going into engineering it helps to be attached to a school that is recognized for it's engineering education.",

I agree that Academics here are probably a bit better, but if you really want the social aspect I would take SDSU. You can still make a lot of friends here, but you have to go out of your way to do so.",

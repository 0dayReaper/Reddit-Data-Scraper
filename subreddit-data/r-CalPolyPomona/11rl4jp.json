Did it help you find a job? How were the networking events? What was the mentoring network thing like? Thanks",

The rest of what they \"offer\" is an opportunity for YOU to give THEM money and time and energy. \n\nI didn't look too much into what kind of insurance they offer or how good it actually is, just that it's one of the things they advertised.",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman with a declared major in AE and want to switch to ME. I know about the requirements and on the website. However, I wanted to ask when the earliest I can apply is. The requirement said the deadline to apply is the 5th week of spring. However, it says I also need 30 units completed. Will I be able to apply before I finish the 30 units spring semester of my first year? If not, can I apply that summer, or will I have to wait till fall and be approved by the spring of my second year?\n\nWith that said, how long is it to swap after applying? Will it affect my 4-year promise program pledge if I'm still on track to graduate in 4 years still even after the switch (I'm confident due to the number of ap credits I have)",

I don\u2019t remember her name short Hispanic younger lady\u2026 I am also incoming freshman so I have no experience but I would expect some pushback especially since ME is the most impacted",

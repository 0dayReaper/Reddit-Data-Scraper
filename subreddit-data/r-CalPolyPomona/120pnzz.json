My main school I\u2019m transferring from does not have the class but we have a sister school that does. The class is Electric Circuits, my major is comp engr. I regret not reading the rate my professor reviews, they were really bad in terms of the professor. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to admission and records and they said they won\u2019t know until they receive my final transcripts. I\u2019m over 60 units and met my golden 4, would my admission be revoked?",

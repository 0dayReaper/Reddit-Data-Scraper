I want to have the application filled out so that I can submit it on April 3rd\n\nSo is there something wrong with the site or do I just have to wait until April 3rd to fill out the application?\n\nAlso, I am a current first year, but I am about to complete 24 semester units by the end of the semester.",

If you have another option I would consider looking elsewhere. \n-a former ra",

If I knew more I would help you but I graduated in the fall and moved out, I've just been keeping tabs and hearing about the mess through friends and previous roommates. My best bet for you would be to email the village office, and then if you don't hear back to call them.  \n\nYou can also join the village discord and poke around for information there: https://discord.gg/VSa7GfnY",

Please, people if you find any valuables or currency, please return it or report especially if it has an identification. I'm sure the owner will appreciate it.",

So, if the individual who took the money left and there was a camera around, that would be concrete evidence. I'm not sure if we're allowed to request information about who handed in the lost item, so I'm hesitant to go ask.",

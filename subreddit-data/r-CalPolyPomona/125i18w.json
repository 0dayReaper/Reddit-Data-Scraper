And which one should I pick? Thank you.",

            "comment": "Isnt too hard! You do have to complete at least two semesters at CPP in order to request to switch majors though. However, good news is that during those two semesters you can do a mix of GEs and the classes you are required to take to switch your major. \n\nFor CS they ask you take CS 1300, CS1400, CS 2400, and MAT 1140 (C or better) in order to switch majors so you should start off with first seeing if they have any prereqs you need to fulfill in order to take them and complete those classes. \n\nYou also need to have a 3.25 GPA (Overall and CPP GPA).\n\nOnce you complete all those things, you can request to be added to the Change of Major Canvas by contacting the CS department and complete the module. Once you do they'll guide you with the rest!\n\nHope that helps clarify some things!",

                            "comment": "So from what i saw on the CPP website which lists the classes you need (I'll link it at the bottom)  you could probably get these classes your first semester even as a non-CS major since you don't need to be a CS major to enroll. I think the only thing that can stop you from taking the class is the math level you enter with.\n\nFor example,\n\nYou can enroll into both CS1300 and CS1400 during your first semester even as a non-CS major but both require you to be either be *eligible* for MAT 1140 or have it done. (MAT 1140 being Calc 1).\n\nIf you take all three (MAT 1140, CS 1300, and CS 1400) the first semester (with the rest being GEs) you can take CS2400 (which also can be taken even if you're not a cs major) by the second semester since that class requires MAT 1140, CS 1300, and CS 1400 in order to enroll in it. (Which will take care of the CS 1300, CS1400, CS 2400, and MAT 1140 requirement to change majors).\n\nIn fact, I think only the CIS 3010 and above classes are only limited to CS majors but by then, you should have no problem switching majors since the \"lowest level\" class for only CS major (CIS 3010) require at least 2 semesters before you can take it (as it requires CIS 2400).\n\n*Also* no need to stress on taking all these classes at the same time and rushing to change your major. The CPP roadmap for computer science majors even has them split up (so instead of taking CS1300 &amp; CS1400 together like I mentioned, they split it between the first and second semester) and then has you take CS 2400 in your second year (I'll link the roadmap at the bottom too so hopefully it gives you a good idea of what classes you could take during your first year). Keeping your grades up is important (especially for the GPA requirement) so if you feel you don't want to risk overwhelming yourself and ending up with a low grade for any of the classes that are needed to change your major, I recommend following the roadmap that splits the classes up.\n\nI hope I wasn't too confusing lol!\n\nLinks:\n\n* List of Classes for Computer Science Majors: [https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview\\_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;hl=%22Computer+Science%22&amp;returnto=search](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;hl=%22Computer+Science%22&amp;returnto=search)\n* Computer Science Major Roadmap (Year 1- Year 4: Semester by Semester Guide): [https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview\\_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=16797](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=16797)",

I applied for physics although it doesn\u2019t interest me nearly as much as cs so would definitely be trying to switch. I think physics might align more with computer science than STS. I\u2019ve looked at the programs catalog of courses and they share math like calc, also intro to Newtonian mechanics and others. STS from what I\u2019ve seen seems to not share as many courses with cs. Can\u2019t speak on how hard it is to switch, wondering the same.",

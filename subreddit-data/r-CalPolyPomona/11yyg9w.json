Since the buildings are smaller than the newer residential buildings it is easier to run into the same people. I made friends at the traditionals because I slowly built up the courage to talk to new people as I kept seeing them over and over again. I don\u2019t have experience living in the residential buildings, so I don\u2019t know what it is like, but in my opinion I think the traditionals provide a greater sense of community. I would definitely live here again if I didn\u2019t have to pay so much for housing lol.\n\nAlso it is not required to live on campus, but it is less stressful to get to class.",

Plus the living situation in Secoya/Sicomoro is miles ahead of the traditional dorms. \n\nI'm a freshman who lives in Secoya and have made plenty of friends - on my floor, other floors, at the gym, classes, clubs, library. I have walked up to random dudes at the gym or around the campus that I've seen a couple times and just been like \"Wsp\" and boom that's another friend you got. The first week you might feel a little isolated but as classes get into it I promise you'll be fine.\n\nIf you aren't the most social person, Greek life is an option.",

In the new ones, you're not as incentivized to leave your room or area because its more inviting and you wanna be there more. \n\nEveryone wants to get into the residentials so they're full. It is a coin toss tbh on whether the people on your floor are social or not + comes down to gender too. In a lot of Secoya floors, especially mine, I noticed that the guys tend to be more social and chill with the others on our side while the girls either stay with their roommates or maybe one other dorm there. Plus, a lot of people room with those they knew from hs or back home so they're not very likely to be as social.",

I can easily see how my social life at CPP would have been EVEN more enriched had I started here from day 1 and lived on campus \n\nYou need to put in some effort, though. Muster up the initial courage to interact with people, and your socializing skills will improve so fast; you don\u2019t need to be an extrovert to learn how to be outgoing \n\nAlso, find campus orgs that interest you; they can be a mix of purely social ones and merit-based ones for networking and resume-building opportunities. Allow yourself to open up, and maybe even consider taking on a leadership role \n\nMost importantly, congrats on the acceptance!!",

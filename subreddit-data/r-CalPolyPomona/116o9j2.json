    "postText": "I was accepted to Computer Engineering major but I might want to switch to Computer Science.  I believe I won't be able to switch majors until sophomore year (?) so I want to try to take classes first year that will be applicable in both.  Any suggestions on how to go about doing that?  I believe Calculus and Physics and some GEs would work for both majors.  Also, I am wondering if I take ECE Discrete Structures if that will apply to CS major (which requires CS Discrete Structures).  Thanks for any thoughts on this scenario, or keeping options open for switching between ANY majors.",

Also note that there's no guarantee you can switch majors as CS is impacted. You already mentioned calc/physics which is a good idea. If you're committed I'd take CS1300/1400.",

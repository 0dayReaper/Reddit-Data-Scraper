    "postText": "Hi there,\nI plan to transfer to cpp instead of the UCs to save some money for my master/professional engineering degree. Also, among my friends who transfer this fall or next fall, I am the only one who\u2019s interested in chemical engineering.\nBy the curriculum, I noticed that CPP\u2019s program is quite focused on material engineering (which is a plus).\nHowever, some relatives graduating from CPP told me I would be better off with the UCs for both chemical and material engineering.\nI read through some numbers from collegefactual.com and find out the students graduating from chem engineering is less than 1/3 of other majors like electrical/mechanical/civil engineering and that BI is a dominating major in CPP.\n\nPersonally, I think a degree is a degree and as my goal is to get a master or EIT, I don\u2019t want to pay the premium of UCs for an undergraduate degree.\n\nHowever, I appreciate it a lot if any current students or alumni could give me some insight on the the program and jobs outcomes as well as research opportunities for chemical engineering? Would you recommend the master in material engineering program after getting my bachelor's?\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "If you had a very specific target for going into academic research as a chemical engineer/materials science/etc, there may be an argument to be made to choose a UC. They have larger budgets for research and that tends to drive the school's focus. Outside of that narrow focus I can't see how choosing CPP for your undergrad in ChemE could hurt you, particularly if you're going to grad school after anyway. I would have great difficulty justifying the excessive cost of a UC program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou'll have the same struggles/annoyances with admin, terrible parking, and the challenge of getting classes, but the couple of ChemE peers I knew are all doing well for themselves. The CPP degree certainly didn't hurt them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn regards to your masters program - I would recommend that if at all possible you get a future employer to pay for it. Get your undergrad, knock out your EIT and PE when possible, but get someone else to pay for the graduate work. If you want more specific recommendations maybe try reaching out to the department. Chances are you can get some feedback from one of the professors that will give you a little better guidance.",

There were 300 people my first year here and now there are about 60 (would be less if not for online school). ChemE is barely about chemistry, lots of people dropped out after they knew that.\nYou will learn some professors aren't the best, but come senior year, you will learn a lot about real life engineering.\nYou will do senior project your junior year, this can be about chemical or material engineering, sign up fast though because good projects get taken fast. The design project will be the focus senior year where you design a chemical plant with your class.\nFeel free to DM me if you have questions.",

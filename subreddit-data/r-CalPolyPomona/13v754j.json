    "postText": "So I\u2019m actually already a graduate business student at Fullerton, it\u2019s a good school and all but I want to switch programs. I\u2019m in the master of accounting program at Fullerton but I want to pursue a masters in business analytics instead. \n\nNgl it\u2019s kind of a blessing how many resources we have for business students at Fullerton but most of them lead to opportunities in Orange County and I want to work in LA. \n\nDoes CPP have good resources , active clubs, etc for business students? Do big companies come to job fairs here?\n\nA lot of ppl I go to school with at Fullerton are telling me to just switch to another program here bc of the opportunities but I\u2019m still leaning toward coming to CPP if I get in lol. \n\nThoughts?",

    "postText": " Hi, I just received the admission decision from Pomona and unfortunately, I was denied because I didn't have enough transferable units. I forgot to check the box on CalState Apply. I attended college in a different state, and 37 of my units were from IVC, which is why the box wasn't automatically checked when I entered my courses that were not from IVC. Has this happened to anyone before? Can I appeal the decision? I will have 72 credit hours by the end of this spring semester.",

In your statement write it was your mistake and that you\u2019ll have the necessary units to transfer after Spring is over. My appeal was accepted and I was able to be admitted to CPP, good luck.",

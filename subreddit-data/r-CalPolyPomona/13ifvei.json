    "postText": "Hey @everyone!\n\nI am wondering if it is a negative if I take courses during the summer term prior to my start at CPP in the fall term? \n\nThey are not \u201cmajor specific\u201d courses (just some random psych courses). \n\nI am a biology major for premed, and at my cc I just need 2 psych courses to get an AST-psych. (Again this isn\u2019t at all a priority for me just a little side project, cuz I\u2019m bored) \n\nBut I\u2019m worried it might look bad in my future applications for med school? Or am I totally wrong here? A counselor at my cc told me I need to talk to a cpp advisor about it which I did, basically she said \u201cyou only have 70 transferable units (which I already used up)\u201d kind of a vague answer. \n\nLmk your thoughts ! \nDani",

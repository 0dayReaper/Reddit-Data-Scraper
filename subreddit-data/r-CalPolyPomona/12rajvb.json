    "postText": "I swear the world hates me or I have the worse immune system ever. I have gotten sick (Not Covid related) 3 or 4 times this semester which basically means I have been sick every month basically. Life sucks. I have one professor that's pregnant and did not want us to come in at all if we were sick. She eventually told me I can not keep calling out (I legit only called out 3 or 4 times and we have class once a week). I hope she enjoys me coughing tomorrow! \n\nI am just taking some cold medicine, soup, and lots of water. Life just sucks.",

Trying to find info about what the minimum grades are that are needed in senior year of high school / sent in final transcript.  This last semester of high school has been rough.  I have read that you need at least a C- in all classes - does that sound right?  Thanks",

            "comment": "I would say that you can only hurt yourself by not passing your classes. Pass your classes with a C- or better. Try to get a decent GPA. It also depends on whether your coming in for an impacted major or not. If it\u2019s impacted it\u2019s more competitive and you want to show you have the skills to handle college level coursework. If it\u2019s not impacted, you can get away with a lower gpa.",

I saw her assignment grades they were high compared to the wrong answers she gets (mostly A's for C work).  The teacher has the same last name as her (Smith), so they must be related.  The teacher is known to be a hard ass, but she ranked the highest in the class.  just a thought",

    "postText": "Is it possible to take Mat 3140, Mat 3060, Mat 4990 and possibly Mat 4190. Would all 4 be doable? Mat 3060 is completely asyn, Mat 4990 is sync and Mat 3140 and Mat 4190 are hybrid. I\u2019ve been told that 3060 and 4990 are easy as hell so it would come down to 3140 and 4190 that would be the difficult ones but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s too much workload to add 4190 or if I should just drop 4990 and only take the 3 (3060,3140,4190).",

            "comment": "It's not necessarily about how easy or hard a class is, it's mainly the amount of time you have as the semester is very short. If you want an A in all the courses, but because the workload is too much you may find yourself struggling to keep them all or some towards that goal. Also depending if you have maxed the number of units for your regular semesters, you may be paying for summer courses out of pocket.",

I don\u2019t care much to get straight A\u2019s but definitely looking to pass all the classes I have with at least a C minimum. I luckily don\u2019t work except for 2 days out the week",

    "postText": "Hi @everyone \n\nToday I received an email from a school I had no intention of attending since I committed to Cal Poly Pomona, stating that I \u201cconfirmed\u201d my attendance to that school\u2026 which I didn\u2019t. \n\nI figured since I settled on CPP and manually accepted/confirmed my attendance that I would just do nothing for the other 5 schools I got into. \n\nWas this wrong? Should I have manually went into each of the schools portals and \u201cdeclined\u201d the offers? \n\nI\u2019m getting kind of nervous about the whole thing. Because I obviously don\u2019t want that to affect me status at CPP (hopefully just overthinking this). \n\nDoes anyone know anything about this and whether or not I should be concerned? \n\nThanks! \nDani",

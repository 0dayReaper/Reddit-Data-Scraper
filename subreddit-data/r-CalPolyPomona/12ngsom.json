    "postText": "I've been accepted into both UCSB and CPP for CompSci, but I'm leaning more towards CPP as it's 40k/yr compared to 70k/yr at SB (I'm OOS). However, I'm just curious about what the computer science outlook at CPP is like. How are the CS internships and are they difficult to obtain? Are the classes structured well? I'd also like some input on the opportunities available at the school if possible. Thank you!",

I did not attend both schools (most of us?) so I can only tell for cpp. I got lucky enough to get good and knowledgeable professors so they make the class structure very well and interesting, but my friends who got bad professors would talk differently. Networking is depending on you as if you are willing to attends activities in clubs, events, group projects coversations, etc. I so far made very good friends here and we learned from each other a lot from school and industry stuffs. There is a good amount of opportunities for cs as long as you put enough effort to apply and search. I have heard a lot of complains from others about this school in general and our major before I attended here but I see the difference just after a semester. So the point is, it is all depend on YOU. Please consider carefully as in the end you are the only one who takes responsibility for your decision!",

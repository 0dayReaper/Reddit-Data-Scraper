I definitely want to get a masters in the future and I'm afraid that this major might impact my chances of getting accepted into a graduate program. Honestly, I just couldn't decide between mechanical and electrical eng so I picked this but I'm afraid I made a mistake. Any advice?",

It\u2019s a exam that\u2019s tests your comprehension of engineering and they have them for most of the engineering disciplines, so if you want to be a mechanical engineer you would take the M.E. one. You can take it without any qualifications. And it just proves you know Engineering, some think it\u2019s an equivalent to a degree.",

So I changed to construction in Spring 2019 (since it was less impacted and gave me access to CE classes), and changed and got into to civil engineering with no issue in Fall 2019.\n\nI did not talk to anyone and just submitted the change of major form each time (but this might have changed now, so double check).\n\nIf you're not too sure between Mechanical and Electrical, I'd say try to get into Mechanical as it generally more flexible. But more context is needed and perhaps more research on your end.\n\nI personally don't like construction (CEM) and engineering tech majors because of the confusion it causes for employers and other engineers I've talked to but that may not be the case for everyone. In terms of getting licenses it shouldn't be an issue and you're not necessarily going to be overlooked in graduate programs just because you're an engineering tech major",

But no, it shouldn't be hard to change majors but you need to speak to a counselor from your department and talk to those who sit in front of the class because those students are statistically more often the serious ones. But make sure you don't change from biology to TOM like I did unless you feel it being worth it. I went up to organic chemistry and almost had enough to transfer but honestly I wish I got into engineering myself but TOM is the closest to engineering in the business. Msot engineering majors have similar requirements anyway but the major courses are what differ significantly. earned my BS in May 22 \ud83d\ude4c and I wish you the best of luck. DONT GIVE UP. I almost did and with the support of my family, I kicked my last years ass. \ud83d\udcaf",

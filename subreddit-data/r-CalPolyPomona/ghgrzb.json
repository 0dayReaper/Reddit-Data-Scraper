You have to apply to the flight training part and they accept a lot less people than the ones taking ground school. I recommend doing ground school online. However, if next semester is online, I do recommend taking ground school at Mt. SAC. The teacher (Linda Rogus) is very knowledgeable and extremely nice. But don't expect to get into the Mt. SAC flight training.\n\nFor the flight training, I'm doing it from cable air at Cable airport. I did it with an instructor named Ralph and I highly recommend!\n\nFeel free to PM If you have any questions!",

SJ is still recoving form covid,  but there are plenty of bars/clubs/restaurants/shit to do within a 5min walk from campus. CPP is kinda in the middle of nowhere(walking distance wise) and the social scene is pretty weak.",

Cpp is in Southern California and near the city with lots of job opportunity and SJSU is near Silicon Valley which doesn\u2019t need much explaining. I\u2019d say go out and visit the econ departments if you\u2019re really not sure.",

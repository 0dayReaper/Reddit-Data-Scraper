    "postText": "Got home tonight and just realized that I left my ThermoFlask in Building 15, room 1807. It's a 40oz bottle, white with a black cap, but it has a black rubber case on it. It was left under my chair which was the 4th one on the right from the center walkway along the 2nd row. Already filed a report to the games room lost and found. If someone finds it, please send it there if you can, thank you!",

My experience with the class is that it was an easy class with an easy group quiz a week. The department stated that they want their Kin classes to be more education focused as well, so know that quizzes are likely to be involved in the class (difficulty depends on professor). My experience was that it is an easy nice going class that taught me new stretches that I still use.",

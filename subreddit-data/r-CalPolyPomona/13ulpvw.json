    "postText": "Hello everyone. Are in-person orientations organized by major? I was accepted as math major, but recently thought of choosing aerospace engineering. I don\u2019t think I can change my major yet, but I really want to. I don\u2019t want to miss out on important information about the aerospace engineering orientation. If possible, to anyone who is attending orientation this July for aerospace engineering, I would really appreciate it if you replied to this post with some information that might be useful for me to know as a new transfer student. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Honestly, there isn\u2019t too much info in the orientation, other than the labs, which are mostly in building 13 (structures lab, low speed wind tunnel, super sonic wind tunnel and liquid rocket lab) \nA lot of the info you need is in the curriculum sheet or the flow chart. My only suggestion is to knock out your 1XXX &amp; 2XXX classes. Try to take the structure series before you take the 3XXX &amp; 4XXX series. \nI suggest joining the cal poly aerospace club discord\n\nAlso, feel free to DM me",

The answer from the mech engineering department chair was that you must be enrolled for a year before changing majors. But you may be able to take many of the same classes you will need for aero in your first year. \n\nI would definitely contact the Aero Engineering chair and get some solid information.\n\nAlso the orientation is a one on one with your department chair, so you will be meeting with the math department chair for your orientation.",

You can ask for your counselor about that. If aerospace engr is impacted, it might take a while for your form to get approved. When it gets approved, I believe you have to attend a meeting with the board.",

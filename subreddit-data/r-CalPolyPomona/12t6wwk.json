The biggest help for me was planning my assignments in a planner and always trying to be a week ahead. Some professors lock assignments until a certain date but if you send them an email explaining your situation sometimes they unlock it so you can do it early. \n\nIn my experience the toughest courses were: Intermediate Acc 2,\nCost Acc,\nFRL 3000,\nTOM 3020,\n\nIt\u2019s tough at times but it\u2019s completely doable. \n\nGood luck!",

I also took TOM3020 the semester before and did the same thing because it wasn\u2019t easy for me. Other than those 2 courses you should be good. I also work full time and took 15 units so it\u2019s doable",

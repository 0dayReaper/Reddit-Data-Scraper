If you don't care and don't mind it saying class of 24 plus coming back to campus to pick up everything in the spring then it doesn't matter. Completely up to your preference",

I believe you can also buy your regalia gear in Fall and it will have the appropriate year on it for 2024, since that is when you would participate in commencement. I finished last fall 2022 as well I bought my regalia this Spring.",

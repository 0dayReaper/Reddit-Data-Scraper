    "postText": "How hard is EGR 4050? From what I've seen, the failure rate is considerably high for this class so I'm wondering if it's even doable over the summer, especially alongside other classes. The professors offered for this course over the summer are Ali Sharbat + Yongping Zhang.",

A friend of mine had another combo and he did like 1-2 hrs a week tops lmaooo\n\nEither way Zhang and sharbat are chill and usually ez profs so I doubt you'd be hard pressed to pass",

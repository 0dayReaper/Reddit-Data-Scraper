Does anyone know if it\u2019s possible/had experience with getting a spot from this position or is it not likely?\n\nI\u2019m trying to get any type of on-campus housing, including the suites but everything seems taken already",

Anyways, i think i was 118 on the waitlist and got a spot relatively quickly after that. Maybe a month or so went by. There is hope, but always have a backup",

    "postText": "Hi! A few days ago I asked if I should go to UCI or Pomona and after reading all of the comments and researching, I figured that Pomona is the best fit for me so I will become a Bronco. However, I saw that housing is a requirement for incoming freshmen. Issue is my parents would have to pay a lot of money if I have to do housing which they will not be able to do and I plan to do an exemption. My question is that are they lenient with accepting exemptions and what kind of proof should I provide to have mine approved? Thank you all so much :)",

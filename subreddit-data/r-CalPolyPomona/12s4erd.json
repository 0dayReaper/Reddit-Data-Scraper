There were some classes (mostly 2311/L) that were particularly hard to get, but there's a new professor teaching it with more space and times, so it should be easy. And if you're a senior and really need it to graduate, the department will help you get in.\n\nI'm graduating soon and I've always been able to get the classes I need without priority registration.\n\nGood luck and welcome!",

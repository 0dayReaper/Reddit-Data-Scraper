I need to take this class to start my senior design project which I need to finish to graduate. Fuck CPP. If you are considering coming here, don't.",

The best thing OP can do is get on the waitlist, hope they open a new section (and it's ALWAYS with like a few hours notice) and then the department coordinator will give them a timeframe to accept a position in the class. Otherwise, it's a waiting game. They're severely understaffed and the current staff are overworked. I hear you, OP, and I agree. The department THEMSELVES will admit they have problems, but will do little to rectify it.",

I don't know all the details, but I'm under the impression that there are people who probably would like to fill this need, but the dept/school is so frustrating and mismanaged that these people are better off doing something else with their time.",

The issue we currently face is the lack of professors which hinders people from graduating if they do not have priority registration. You do not see this issue in upper divs at other universities such as UCs is because professors are there to research and they dedicate their life to that. However, at CPP, our professors came from the industry and mainly came here to teach. However, many such as Gonzalez eventually grew tired from teaching and rather work at NASA instead.",

Unlike other majors, this is truly a 5 year program (there is an entire year added to the curriculum). One big difference with other majors is that architecture classes stay pretty much together for the entire time.  What keeps them together is the sequence of studio courses that start from day one all the way to graduation.  Studio classes are from about 20 to 25 students but there used to be at least 4 sessions every quarter and I believe are guaranteed. In other words, It's a very structured program.  As I understand it, architecture has a very high and timely graduation rate.  Maybe this can be replicated by other departments?",

    "postText": "I am asenior who took a CSU transferable beginning drawing course to satisfy the VPA requirement. CPP denied admission saying I didn't meet the minimum eligibility (A-G) requirements; the course doesn't satisfy CSU GE:C1 category. I didn't take the course to get college credits, just to complete VPA requirement. I got into SJSU at the same time. Is it a CPP restriction that dual enrollment students can only take CSU GE courses to satisfy A-G requirements?",

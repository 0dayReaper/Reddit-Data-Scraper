    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nReally excited to say that I've been accepted as a transfer for Applied Math/Stats major! I was originally planning on CS but truthfully I didn't have the pre-reqs for it, so I was accepted off my alt major. My career goal is to still go into SWE though and I was wondering if any of you have also taken this path? How were internship opportunities for SWE as a math major?\n\nI know that you're able to transfer majors, but since CS is so highly impacted I'm assuming that it'll be nearly impossible to do this. I also don't want to be in college for longer than necessary.\n\nOn a related note, I also got accepted into CSUF's CS program. I'm still not sure which one I'm leaning towards since I hear great things about both programs. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I live closer to Pomona.",

    "postText": "I am an in coming transfer student, and I have heard about ways you can get free on campus housing. I heard about one job where you take care of some of the animals and you get free room and board plus a wage. People have said there are other jobs like that too, but I looked around on google and I couldn't find anything about that. Do you guys know how I can get my hands on a job like that, or if they even exist?",

            "comment": "Like other comments have mentioned, we have a beef unit and horse center that have live in positions but both prefer you to have previous animal experience. I believe those openings are posted on handshake. \n\nI would recommend becoming an RA instead though. The provided housing is better and the hours are a lot better too. Being a live-in, you end up having to work a lot more than what they put in the job description since you're essentially \"on-call\". You can also get a position working at the village at the front desk or mail room and they give you a discount on rent (although I can't remember the exact percentage) \n\nI think RA applications for next year have already passed, but definitely something to consider in the future!",

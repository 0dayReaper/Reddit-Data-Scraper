Especially once you take 3000 and 4000 classes because chances are you\u2019ll probably have more than one class with them! I agree with u/sun_rot, joining clubs is also always a great way to make friends, but don\u2019t sweat it",

It is also a good idea to talk to people in your major and make friends with them as you\u2019ll share classes with them for the next 4 years. Campus does host events to help people meet friends. In my experience people are very friendly here so I would not be to worried, I met a good amount of my friends while cooking in the dorm kitchen and offering them food. Good luck!!",

Also take into account that you\u2019re not alone and if you feel anxious or anything else of the sort it\u2019s very likely that those around you feel the same, so don\u2019t shy away from introducing yourself :)",

You'll meet a wide array of people, after that there's events and clubs on campus where you can find people with similar interests.\n\nHopefully you don't experience this, but unfortunately a good amount of people I knew straight up disappeared after freshman year. They either went back home, transferred to other places, dropped out, etc. \n\nJust be ready to be adaptable, you can always meet more people here with the right mindset.",

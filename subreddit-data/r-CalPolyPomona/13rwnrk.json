    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman who is currently provisionally accepted at Cal Poly Pomona. However, I might have a single F (maybe D if I can bring it up in a few hours) in AP Statistics\u2026 how at risk am I at having my offer rescinded?\n\nSome background information:\n3.8 GPA, passed every other class (unfortunately three with C\u2019s but the rest A\u2019s), and as much as I don\u2019t want to make excuses, I only have recently started seeing a counseling as I suspect I may have some kind of depression.\n\nReading from posts online and how competitive admissions have become, I\u2019m starting to panic that I\u2019m severely at risk of having my offer rescinded, especially since I do not currently have a plan B or many other offers remaining. I do plan on calling the office of admissions just to let them know what\u2019s going on, but if anyone has some sort of advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much!",

Just make sure if there is any math qualifying tests to take that you complete them. I don't know what your major is but I had to take an ALEKS test to get me into calc that later year.\n\nStory is very relatable since I failed precalc my senior year and it did not affect my status staying in engineering school. I did tho learn enough to pass the qualifying test and go to calc 1.\n\nGood Luck you got this!",

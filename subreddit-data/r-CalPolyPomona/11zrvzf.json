Everyone is pretty nice but a lot of people have outside responsibilities, so sometimes small groups have conflicting schedules but most people work around it.",

It\u2019s not as brutally antisocial as people make it out to be; if you\u2019re a social and outgoing person, you\u2019ll have no trouble having a social life around this school. That being said, if you\u2019re more introverted, it will be a little bit more difficult",

I had lots of fun and I won\u2019t let anyone discredit the amount of fun, socializing, and career development that I got from joining one.\n\nI also know that clubs will have a lot going on and have their own shindigs too. Can\u2019t go into the school already with the mindset of \u201cclock in/clock out\u201d otherwise you won\u2019t have fun.",

My undergrad was a commuter school but unlike Pomona, it was in a city with a lot of things to do and a lot of transportation options up until midnight. If I went to CPP for undergrad I would\u2019ve been disappointed ngl. It\u2019s great for Masters though.",

            "comment": "In the past, parking was always the absolute worst thing about CPP... but I hear much less complaints about it now compared to previous years, especially since more parking structure projects have been completed. So today, maybe the \"worst\" thing is if you are a very socially active person, then the lack of social events / fraternity / sorority life may be a downside for you -- if you are looking for a more \"traditional\" college experience. If you are a mature student and strictly about the education, then that probably won't matter much either.\n\nAesthetically, it is a beautiful campus in the hills and is pretty well maintained imo. Some of the buildings are outdated, but some of the newer additions (college of business for example) provide a pretty nice environment.\n\nI've never visited SLO or Bakersfield, but I've spent a lot of time in the dorms at Channel Islands and around the campus itself. CalPolyPomona provided a much better experience for me over and felt a lot less isolated from the outside world than CSU CI did imho.",

I live at the village so I saw them frequently lol. \n\nA lot of clubs and opportunities here. There are so many club fairs, career fairs, seminars and presentations for a lot of diff majors so you\u2019d be well set off in terms of academics.\n\nDislikes: Probably the overall weather (seems contradictory), during the first two months of fall sem. it was brutally hot. \n\nCan\u2019t attest to other unis but the faculty shortages are real here. On top of that there are only a few good ones here per subject (heavily depends on dept tho, just speaking from my experience).\n\nOther notes:\nAs a CSUCI local, the weather in vta county is amazing, all days are the same (cool breeze, ~75\u00b0). Not much in terms of nightlife and invigorating uni life but you\u2019ll get that at most csus.\n\nUsed to live near SLO and its pretty cozy up there. A lot closer to your stereotypical college experience.",

            "comment": "The cost is nice if you love nearby, though that brings up commuting. It's not great here, but we finally have a direct silver streak line which is def a plus.\n\nLikes: Environment, the overall look and cleanliness of most buildings. Good easy access to a highway. Campus is a mix between small and.big, so everything you need to go to is usually within a 15 minute walk. Commuter school, usually gets emptier the later it gets (around 4ish from what I see). Though more traffic flow since it's a commuter school. Free transport around campus, but it's unreliable. \n\nDislikes: Faculty is lacking in numbers. Sometimes you find pretty good faculty but it'll be a bit rare. The college lacks great food options. The $11 buffet(dining hall) is nice, but you most likely will not leave satisfied. Housing is pricey. Not many schoolwide events. Fixed tuition cost depends on the person. And again varies from person to person, it's a commuter school, so usually people are there to get what they need, and get out.\n\n(Edit) and parking isn't too bad, though you usually run a risk. Throughout my two years here, haven't seen a campus officer, but that's probably due to me having weird schedules. (Parking pass is now ONLY all days of the week, meaning regardless if you need.parkong on Tues&amp;Thurs or Mons&amp;Weds, you pay all 5 days. Lastly, the newest parking structure has no cameras iirc, so of you look into the reddit a bit, you'll heard of Catalytic converters getting stolen or vehicles getting broken into.",

Sadly, people don't report the crime as much as they should on campus too, but felony theft is common in the parking areas.  \n\nNo on campus life. The school seemingly takes steps backwards to make the campus more undesirable to stay on. There are few activities. On campus food has partly been shut down and not reopened after the pandemic. Housing is lackluster and expensive, and seemingly designed to milk money while providing the lowest quality possible. Visit Cal poly pomona on the weekend- its dead, everything is closed. No food options outside of the limited hour dorm dining at all.\n\nParking sucks, and is expensive. Expect severe traffic around campus too. Post covid its been better but it will come back- 30 minute waits to reach the freeways. Expect to have to walk a mile to/from your class to \"innovation brewworks\" if you arrive after 10am on a busy day. \n\nThe administration absolutely sucks and lacks any accountability. They will screw you over and they will lose important paperwork- and they will blame you. You will find out about this too late if you assume they won't. They've more moved classes online just so they can increase enrollment without having to invest in the school. My dept chair told me this and he was not happy about it. \n\nEveryone outside of core major courses are \"professor staff\". Cal poly lacks permanent professors and you will find that many teach at multiple colleges and are underpaid. Some classes are hard to come by. Its literally luck of the draw for professor staff. \n\nI liked my major, but outside of that this school was a absolute drain on my soul and overall fucking sucked from the way it was run.",

Lots of clubs and a decent greek life, excellent buildings and facilities (especially the BRIC), and the nearby area around campus is actually pretty nice. The bad is that the city of Pomona itself is kinda bad area, depending on your major you may struggle to get the classes you need, and its kind of a commuter school. From your choices, I'd personally go with this ranking to be honest: 1 CP SLO, 2 CPP, 3 CSUB, 4 CSUCI. I went to high school close to CSUCI (newbury park) and its honestly kinda mid. Camarillo is boring and the campus is surrounded by farms and seperated from urban areas. Can't speak much about Bakersfield, and I've been to CP SLO- its beautiful",

            "comment": "Something you should keep in mind is that your professors can really make or break your class experience based on their expectations and teaching styles. Generally, professors tend to fall on a spectrum based on how engaged in the class they are and how high their expectations are. Depending on what you want out of your classes, the different styles can be good or bad for you.\n\nFor professors with no engagement and no expectations, expect that class to be a complete waste of time that you basically paid for in order to get credits. I didn't know you could get 0/0 in a class, but one of my professors showed that was possible by not putting anything in to the grade book and then being unable to put anything in at the end due to sickness. She taught nothing and went on rambles all throughout the class periods. I ended up either doing homework for other courses in her class or skipping. Learned nothing related to psychology either way.\n\nProfessors with high engagement and high expectations are a challenge for sure, but can be interesting. These are probably more likely to be higher level courses that are trying to prepare you for the field. No complaints.\n\nHigh engagement low expectations are the best professors. They tend to teach the class in a fun way that gets you to actually learn the material while not bombarding you with too much busy work. Professors like these aren't common (at least along the Psychology major), but they're the gems of the semester.\n\nAnd then the most common, low engagement high expectations. From my experience, this is generally the most common with professors assigning a decent chunk of busy work during class and for homework that is barely related to the class subject. It is what it is, and I don't really blame them for doing whatever to fill the time and fulfill their obligations to technically teach the course.",

Second to that is the amount of academic projects (mostly engineering) you can join for extra job experience.\n\nWorst thing is that the whole campus is socially dead.",

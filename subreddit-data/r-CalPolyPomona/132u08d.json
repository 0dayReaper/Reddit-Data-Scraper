    "postText": "hii I was wondering if anyone can help me go about retaking classes that I\u2019ve previously failed. I\u2019m a Mechanical Engineering major and I\u2019ve failed the lecture portion of MFE 2010 but passed the lab. A few weeks ago it was my registration date and I wasn\u2019t able to only select the lecture because BroncoDirect says the lab must also be selected bc it\u2019s a corequisite. When I add the lab to my cart, it says I can\u2019t take the lab bc I can\u2019t retake classes that I\u2019ve passed with a C or better grade. I\u2019ve asked for a permission number for the lecture portion and that still doesn\u2019t work.. I\u2019ve given up taking the class as of next semester but what should I do for next time?",

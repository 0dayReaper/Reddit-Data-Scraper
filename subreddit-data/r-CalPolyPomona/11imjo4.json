For example, Bronco Space considered you a member of the club if you were in the discord server (you should absolutely 100% join in my totally unbiased opinion). Other clubs like AIAA and UMBRA required dues to be considered a member, while LRL had a whole application process that was more like applying to a job than a club.",

The more you're there the more you learn and the more you play a role in the mission, whether it be one of the BLADE high altitude balloon ones or a space mission or the rover or the rocket.\n\nFrom my time in LRL it was the same once you got in, and could learn and do an equal amount, just depends on what you want to do.",

It\u2019s one of, if not, the largest aerospace department in the state. I have a friend who legit turned down a UCLA admission just to come to cpp for aro. The people i\u2019ve met are extremely smart, fun, and helpful. There are plenty of clubs relating to aerospace, plenty of career fairs and internship fairs, and majority of the work is hands on. Learn by doing of course. The only thing I kind of dislike that may be a bit subjective is that since it\u2019s such a large program, the selection for club project seems to be pretty tough to get accepted for. Other than that, I am loving it. Finishing up my first year and can\u2019t wait for the second.",

I knew absolutely nobody before attending and was/still am introverted.\n\nIf you wanna make the experience as memorable as possible, put yourself out there! Just spark a conversation with someone in your classes. \"What's your major\" is a great starter for people outside your core classes. Attend the fairs on campus or stop by the game rooms. The majority of people I meet are pretty quiet like me. \n\nI've only done the lab classes which are entirely group work. Your group can make or break your experience here, so I recommend being social by any means the first few days to get with a good group. I didn't do this my first semester so my group was a bit disorganized but in the second semester, I made sure to find a good group. \n\nI didn't do any clubs this year because I am very preoccupied with other stuff but I want to do one next semester. They're great for meeting people with the same interest and they also look great on your resume. The fees to join most are extremely cheap and they host a ton of events with guest speakers, teams, etc. \n\nGet to know your professors personally. Attend their office hours, ask questions, get help, or just talk to them about their experience in the industry. Just get on their good side. They can be the connection you need to get a job. \n\nOverall, it's what you make of it.",

It also comes down to how much time you put into each class, of course, because as students we\u2019re also part of equation in our own success. *Oh, and before I forget: I\u2019d recommend doing the Aero Project 1 year before the Design course, as it\u2019s tough to do both simultaneously.\n\nAs far as what I disliked, I guess these are all to be expected: some were tough graders, 1 or 2 delved too deep into theory and dissecting equations instead of teaching applications, 1 or 2 just read off of slides instead of teaching. But again, part of what forms our success comes down to time spent outside the classroom. CPP definitely is more of a hands-on, application-type school. Less dissecting equations and more how to apply them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I can compare to the UCs since I don\u2019t know anyone who went there. The Aero Profs are mainly from industry (with the exception of Prof Ahmadi and Sutoudeh I believe), so the program itself is great. I think the connections our dept has are great and a lot of clubs/ projects by Profs get funding through those companies, so it\u2019s another way to impress them and get internships. \n\nIf you like application more than theory, then CPP is great for you. I\u2019ve always enjoyed science classes, but I really loved the labs, and so CPP was a good fit for me. I also like the fact that it\u2019s only about $8-9k in tuition per year.

He had his heart set on SLO when we visited last spring because of their amazing labs and hands-on approach. We are visiting CPP this coming week for a general tour. He really wants an internship (and hopefully future job) at JPL or NASA someday. CPP unfortunately doesn't offer tours of their Engineering Department. How have you liked the program so far? He'll be living on campus as a Freshman. We heard it's mostly a commuter campus but hoping he can make friends through clubs. Any tips, advice, etc. is greatly appreciated!",

I'm a graduating senior in Aerospace in CPP, and I've had internships at NASA, aerospace startups, and I have a job at a huge aerospace company when I graduate. My peers at both internships were from Ivy league schools and UCs, but I do not think for one second that CPP in any way was a detriment to my education and how I looked like on resumes- in fact, I feel the opposite. CPP and its graduates have a reputation in professional aerospace due to its student clubs, senior design courses,  and the general caliber of students that come out of it, especially with local aerospace and defense companies. CPP has plenty of opportunities for connections- especially if you pick up clubs, research projects, and are proactive in seeking them out. :)",

My favorite classes stick out to me the most- space vehicle controls, systems engineering classes, and space environment. \nMy main dislike is the faculty themselves. It feels very much student vs. professor at times, and most of the professors don\u2019t care as much as they should, and can be downright mean and problematic. I have more of an issue with this than other students since Im a woman, and there\u2019s definitely moments of weird shit professors say that shouldn\u2019t even be said. Some have an ass backwards view of industry and the state of the field. There are some great professors that absolutely do care about you and what they teach, and I find that they are some of my most trusted mentors. Most of the faculty in the department suck, but again, my friends, peers, and the understanding of the good professors helps to mitigate that. \nProjects are easy to join- depending on which one. LRL isn\u2019t that easy to join since they\u2019re very much picky on applicants, but Bronco Space and Umbra are both extremely accessible, as well as some of the faculty research projects as well. I do want to add a disclaimer- you still absolutely need to have effort to make yourself noticed and apply to project! Make an active effort and you\u2019ll be fine- it\u2019s easier than you think!",

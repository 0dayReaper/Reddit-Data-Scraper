I\u2019m sure it depends on your job/department. I was looking at remote jobs when I graduated for BS and my masters but she said even though they say you don\u2019t have to be in the area, they want you close and they\u2019ve called almost all remotes back to the office. So I held off applying.",

Not that it\u2019s right but meh.\n\nAnd yes, Boeing does not want remote workers and they\u2019re also moving some of the SoCal locations to St. Louis and other states to pay them less. So not the perfect company but in aerospace, in my opinion, one of the best. It also definitely depends on your department and your location and definitely your manager too",

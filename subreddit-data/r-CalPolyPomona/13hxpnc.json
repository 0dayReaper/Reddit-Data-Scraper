            "comment": "CPP president Bob Suzuki also wanted to award dictatorial president of Zimbabwe who had an atrocious humanitarian record , Robert Mugabe with another honorary degree.  The faculty and students protested and successfully thwarted this effort.  He also wanted to build a golf course on the hills along Temple Ave which would have destroyed the natural habitat and last remaining strands of California Walnut trees.  He is responsible for envisioning the Innovation Village which put a suburban style corporate office park surrounded by a sea of parking on valuable land that could have been better used for academic uses, student and faculty housing and building a much needed retail/ social center for the campus.",

It\u2019s crazy that we have incredible architecture and urban planning programs and yet it almost seems like students have no power in creating sustainable communities around our very own campus. So sad to realize that schools are a business at the end of the day.",

Presidents are intent on leaving their mark on campus.  LaBounty built the CLA, Suzuki the Japanese Garden, Ortiz, tear down the CLA and build the SSB, Coley TBD.  On a more positive note, the Campus Master Plan Draft is reshaping the campus by focusing on pedestrian, bicycle and transportation improvements.",

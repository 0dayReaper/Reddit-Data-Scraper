I know that there impacted majors but I\u2019m not sure as to what I need to do to get in. Is there some classes I need to take I order to qualify? \n-Any help is appreciated thanks",

Usually calculus and physics+lab. \n\nAlso, in my experience, I was able to switch to impacted majors multiple times as long as I met the requirements. It took a while but everything always worked out. \n\nGood luck!",

The signup periods are miserable and classes required to proceed along your major get waitlisted before you even get to sign up. There are people who wait a year or more wasting time because they simply can't get in the classes they need to move along the order of required classes for the major.",

            "comment": "The big issue here is that for the major change you generally need a \"CPP GPA\" in order to fill out the paperwork. That means you need at least one semester of CPP credits before you could change. If your kid comes in as physics major, they would need to target classes/pre-requisites that are appropriate for the major they want to change into, and do well in them in order to make it easier to apply to change majors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor at least the first semester however, your kid is likely stuck in the current major. I would reach out to the ECE department or similar to confirm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the record, per the link below, the specific requirements to major change into computer engineering is 3.1 GPA in CPP courses, C or better in MAT 1140 and 1150, and you have to submit the major change request by the 5th week of the spring term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/guides/changeofmajor/requirements.shtml](https://www.cpp.edu/studentsuccess/guides/changeofmajor/requirements.shtml)",

However, computer engineering curriculum is very similar to the electrical engineering curriculum with a few added programming courses and without hard E&amp;M materials. However, our CS department is very theory and math heavy and it\u2019s not engineering related at all.",

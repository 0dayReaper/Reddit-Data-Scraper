Reading the section on rates it states:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vipf6bmh9lma1.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4a67fd02e98bbb68aee3bd1b408227f66c4b9b7f\n\nmaking no discrepancy between it being your first year or not. I made most of my food last semester and didn't even end up using the majority of my swipes. I didn't even spend all my bronco bucks last semester (at least those roll over) so whatever those swipes are worth just vanished into their pockets.\n\nUHS is nothing but a grift, so I wouldn't be surprised if they force all students of all years to buy their over-expensive meal plan. When I check the FAQ it only says that incoming first-years are required to have it.\n\nAnyone have any experience with dorming more than 1 year and dealing with the meal plan? I literally owe money to housing, and can't even use the money in the account that they forced me to buy to make my payment.\n\nis there any process to get that money back? Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Meal plans are required for those that live on campus regardless if they\u2019re a first year or not. They say in the faq section that when you apply for housing you need to choose a meal plan. It also says that swipes do not roll over so you need to use all of them either at centerpointe or the markets with the exchange rate of 1 swipe = $7. Meal points roll over into the next semester, but not from year to year. I don\u2019t think you can get that money back :/ they say in a bunch of brochures, online, and from the RA zoom meetings at the beginning of the semester that they don\u2019t roll over.",

What an insane rip-off, basically forcing people to give them money whether they buy food or not. I got 800 meal points that im gonna be forced to spend at vista market for stuff i dont need.\n\nThanks for the response.",

My available financial aid for the year reached its cap because they forced me buy the $1700 meal plan last semester and this semester. Money that i literally cant spend fast enough unless i buy useless things that i dont even need.\n\nI have $800 meal points right now and who knows how much money vanished into their pockets last semester from unused meal swipes. \n\nUHS are nothing but bunch of grifters. They set up all the rules so that all the money funnels into their pockets one way or another.",

I was purely addressing your concern of using up your meal points and swipes. I\u2019m not happy I have to pay for a meal plan either but I was aware of all of this when I signed up. Don\u2019t live on campus next year if you dont want to have to pay for a meal plan. If you need to be close to campus the village doesn\u2019t make you pay for a meal plan.",

It just sounded like you were trying to sell me on the benefits of the meal plan when there arent any.\n\n I just hate UHS in general now, not the student workers cause they have nothing to do with anything, but admin. After dealing with their incompetence when dealing with mold in the dorms and now seeing how much of a rip-off the meal plan thing is. Im looking into the village now, but im worried its gonna be the same sh|t show but with even less accountability.\n\nI wouldnt be so bitter if they actually had something to show for all the money they grift. \n\nI apologize if you thought i was upset with you, im just upset. Financial aid is enough for the housing its just not enough for housing AND a forced meal plan \ud83d\ude21",

            "comment": "B1/B2 visas are non-immigrant visas. They prohibit you from enrolling in the course of study in the United States. To study, you will need F1 visa which applies to international student. And international students with F1 visa are not considered a resident and will still have to pay out of state tuition.\n\nTo get an in-state tuition (means cheaper), you need to be a permanent resident (legally get a green card) or a citizen of the United States. Even then, you will also need to be physically present in California for at least one year, with proof of bank statements, driver license, or utility bills.\n\nTL;DR There is no way for an international student to get in-state tuition as they are considered a non-immigrant. You need to be a permanent resident or citizen to get in-state tuition.",

For as far as I know you are still living legally with your B1/B2 visas. More info https://undocu.berkeley.edu/legal-support-overview/ab540-eligibility/\n\nPlease do a research on what considered to be a undocumented immigrant. There are various resources to read out there!",

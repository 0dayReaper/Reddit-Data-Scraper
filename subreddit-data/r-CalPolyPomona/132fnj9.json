    "postText": "Right now I\u2019m an incoming freshman majoring in aerospace engineering. Would it be a good idea to take the ALEKS exam even though I\u2019m currently in AP Calc AB and I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ll be able to get at least a 3 on the exam? I get the results after I register for classes but they said I might not have the prereqs for my major classes since I don\u2019t have the AP Calc result yet. What\u2019s the worst that can happen if I don\u2019t take the ALEKS? Since I did precalc already won\u2019t I just have to repeat calc 1 first semester if I don\u2019t do the ALEKS or get a 3 in AP Calc?",

            "comment": "Hey, I remembering being in your same exact shoes, but I ended up taking the ALEKS placement test. I believe that if you don\u2019t end up passing AP Calc AB, or do well on the ALEKS, then you have to start at college algebra instead of calc 1. This means you will already be a semester or two behind in math. So, definitely take the ALEKS cause you never know. In my case, I ended up getting a 5 on AP Calc AB, so  my score on ALEKS was disregarded.",

            "comment": "Hello, \n\nThe Office of Admissions and the Math department strongly encourage you to still take the ALEKS exam because your AP scores will most likely not released in time for your Orientation, which is when you register for classes. If you decide not to take the ALEKS exam, there is a possibility you will be registered in a lower math class than you need. While there would be a chance for you to enroll in the appropriate math course later in the summer, there is no guarantee that a course will be available to you and therefore, may put your degree progress behind.\n\nWe hope you found this helpful and please reach out to our office if you have any other questions. \n\nOffice of Admissions\n\nCal Poly Pomona",

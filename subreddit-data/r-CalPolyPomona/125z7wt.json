    "postText": "In 2022 I received a large amount of unemployment benefit (EDD) and it increases my EFC in Fasfa so bad (~9300). So the fafsa stated I am not qualified for Pell grants, which makes me feel depressed rn. Anyone here also have the same situation like me or at least have high EFC let me know if they still can get Calgrant B, MCS, and other possible aid offered in CPP? Thank you so much.",

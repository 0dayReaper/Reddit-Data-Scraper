Lots of people still have finals, and don\u2019t even have time to walk back to their dorm before it\u2019s locked up. \n\nStudents should be able to study for finals without worrying about moving out. What is 2 more days when we are paying $7k to $9k a semester to live on campus (in buildings with mold problems).",

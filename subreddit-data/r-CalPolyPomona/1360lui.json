If you didn\u2019t claim any tickets but did apply for graduation, then yes you can walk, you just don\u2019t have tickets for your family to come see you walk. You don\u2019t simply register for commencement. You have to apply for it and choose the term in which you\u2019re graduating, pay a $50 fee and then you\u2019ll be able to claim your tickets and gradpass. The gradpass you\u2019ll need for commencement as well. Talk to the commencement team and/or BAC!",

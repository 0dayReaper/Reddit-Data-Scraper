I could\u2019ve graduated sooner if I took summer classes, but I decided to do an internship instead.",

However, in order to keep the tuition low they jack up the cost of room &amp; board.\n\nBottom line is more student debt in a time of higher inflation that may get higher or stay with us a lot longer.",

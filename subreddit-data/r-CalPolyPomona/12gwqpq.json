    "postText": "Hey everybody, I was accepted for fall 2023 as a freshmen and really want to make sure that I make friends and socialize. Would you recommend going for a triple dorm to increase the amount of people you interact with and potentially become friends with, as well as for the slightly lower price? Or is it just not worth it based on the dimensions of the dorms and such. \n\nAlso, on the topic of socialization, is it true that the traditional dorms are often more social than residential, making it easier to make friends there? Sorry if these are frequently asked questions, I\u2019m just trying my best to set myself up for a good year and make it as easy for myself as possible to make friends here.\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "I'd personally do a double dorm if money isn't an issue. As for traditional vs residential, if you like the idea of living in the newer dorms and don't mind living with a lot of people id choose the residential dorms. If you don't mind the idea of living in the older dorms and like a smaller more major based community then I'd choose traditional. My personal choice of the two would be the residential dorms because I like the idea of the newer living spaces and community isn't a necessity for me.",

            "comment": "If you live in the traditional dorms, a triple will be in a same sized room as a double. Only difference is that there's bunk beds instead and a extra dresser.\n\nImo those rooms aren't big enough for 3 ppl to live in. It feels like a jail cell at that point. You'll run out of space quick and feel cramped.\n\nI would suggest a double. You'll have plenty of opportunities to meet new people in either dorm regardless. You don't have to rely on your dorm choice to meet new people.",

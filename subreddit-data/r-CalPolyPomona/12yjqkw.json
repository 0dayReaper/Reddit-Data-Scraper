Will I be able to search for classes and register on orientation date? I\u2019m just confused because I\u2019m pretty sure homepage says Fall 2023 class registration starts April 10 and every time I try to register it says I\u2019m not allow for the registration window period.",

That way, as soon as they lift the hold you can immediately register for all your classes at once. Why risk another person still in a different orientation group taking your spot?",

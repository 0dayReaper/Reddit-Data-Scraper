    "postText": "Hello,\nI need help! I got admitted to cal poly pomona and I am supposed to send in my official transcripts from community college to cal poly pomona by July 15, the deadline. The problem is that i sent in my transcript this week to cal poly and it it's supposed to say AD-T/ AS-T on my transcript which it doesn't because I sent the official transcript early and I wasn't awarded my degree. I wanted to know if thats going to affect my admissions if I send it again with my transcript indicating that I finished my degree and have the AD-T/AS-T. Thank you.",

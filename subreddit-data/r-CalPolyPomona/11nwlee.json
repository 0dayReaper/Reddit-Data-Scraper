I\u2019m thinking of taking 1 or 2 I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet but can anyone tell me the workload for this or their experiences with these professors for these classes. I\u2019d really appreciate it",

ME 4150 is general a 6/10 class, never had lakeh but heard both good and bad things.\n\nIf I could choose two to take over summer it would be 3121 and 4150. Those classes imo would compliment each other, and I\u2019d rather have to stress over them as my only two classes than stress over them with more on my workload. That way I can find a better prof for 4060 in fall and take Mannion during the normal year.",

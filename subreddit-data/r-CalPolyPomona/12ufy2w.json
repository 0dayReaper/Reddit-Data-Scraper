And this was the cheapest economy car option. I think it would be better to use public transit and Uber/Lyft. And rent a car for short stints if you want to go somewhere far.",

            "comment": "Under the assumption that you're under 25 years of age and can provide proof of auto insurance, the cheapest option might be to rent a car via Turo. It's a website that's essentially the Airbnb of car rentals. Bear in mind that if you are under 25 years of age, you will pay an extra surcharge.\n\nThat said, without knowing anything else about your circumstances, renting a car for that long is a very poor idea from the financial side. If you only need it to get to and from your housing that might be near campus, buying an electric scooter or e-bike will definitely be a much better option. Then if you need to get somewhere farther, just do rideshare when that happens. \n\nBut if money isn't an issue for you, then yeah. Turo is the cheapest option. There's also an Enterprise car rental a few miles away from campus too.",

I already emailed the CE department for info, and will get advisement on what classes to take to appeal for a switch.   \n\n\nCan I hear from people that had this experience though? Or people who are/were in the Civil Engineering program what the course load was like, how the program prepped them skill-wise and job-wise, and what tips you have? Thanks!",

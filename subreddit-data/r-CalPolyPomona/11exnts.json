I\u2019ve learned so much about Real Estate and just good financial knowledge for my life ahead. I think it\u2019s what you make of it. You aren\u2019t gonna be a multi-millionaire with the degree, it\u2019s how you apply yourself with the knowledge you pick up. Dr. Orlando\u2019s class was awesome I highly recommend him for FRL 3062. FRL 3000 does suck I can\u2019t lie. All business majors need to take it though so don\u2019t let it stop you. I honestly think TOM 3020 was another semi-difficult class that no one talks about. I recommend knocking out the easy MHR classes with FRL 3000 so you can balance your work load. Biggest advantage of CPP is that it\u2019s easy to network to LA, the IE, and OC. Companies love CPP business majors so reach out to people and things should work out!",

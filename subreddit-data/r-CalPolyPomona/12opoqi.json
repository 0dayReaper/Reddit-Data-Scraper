    "postText": "I\u2019m having major trouble getting an A in anything in this class. The class is Cultual Anthropology 1020 with Professor Cheetham. Does anybody here have any suggestions for how to get an A in the class??? I asked the professor that question and he gave me a new study method which I used to study for my most recent test in that class and all I got was a B- for my efforts",

He is one of those Professors that thinks his courses that are almost always gen Ed should be one of your more important courses you take. But that\u2019s college you don\u2019t always get what you think you deserve not every professor will set up their course in a way that works for you sometimes you just gotta take what you can get",

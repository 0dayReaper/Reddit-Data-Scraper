I wait for abit refresh and it works for a bit than the connection drops again. The app on my phone is super slow at times too sometimes not loading notifications and announcements regardless if on mobile data or my home network. is it pooping out for anyone else or am I just SOL?",

When Chrome tried to connect to canvas.cpp.edu this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. This may happen when an attacker is trying to pretend to be canvas.cpp.edu, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.\r  \n\r  \nYou cannot visit canvas.cpp.edu right now because the website uses HSTS. Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later.\"",

Looking at Fullerton, they have a Health Service Prep Degree where Cal Poly doesn't. Fullerton looks like it might be better, but I'm an engineering major and haven't attended Fullerton.\n\nT[his website](https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-polytechnic-university---pomona/majors/) is where I got some information. But personally, I would give more weight to other factors for choosing a school such as proximity to resturants/events if you live on campus (Cal Poly doesn't have this).",

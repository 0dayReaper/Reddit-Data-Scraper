    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m debating between whether I should go to college at cal poly Pomona or texas a&amp;m, if anyone at cpp has ever even heard or that school, for architecture and was wondering what it\u2019s like living on campus at Pomona? I know it\u2019s a commuter school so people aren\u2019t as inclined to reach out because they only come there for school and go home straight afterwards, but what about the people who dorm on campus? \n\nFrom personal experience are people that have to stay there usually friendly and outgoing, or is it harder to meet people freshman year because everyone keeps to themselves? Am I gonna be able to talk to and meet people during classes or is it more of a lecture hall style seating? I know the campus is relatively small therefore so are the class sizes, but is that a good thing because people are more willing to reach out to you or bad because it\u2019s harder to find your type of people? Also, how is the area surrounding the college? Are there restaurants and places to go or is it pretty much a ghost town? This would also be helpful to know for getting a job if I move there. I guess overall I\u2019m just nervous thinking about being a freshman all the way in California, and especially being able to meet people on a small campus because I\u2019ll be pretty much alone when I first start there. So if anyone could give there personal experience on how making friends was on campus, especially if you dorm there, that would be greatly appreciated!!\n\nEdit: Wow I definitely didn\u2019t expect so many comments! Thanks for all the help! I\u2019m not super into partying, so that\u2019s not what I mean by social life. I just mean how willing other people are to reach out. For everyone saying Texas A&amp;M, I\u2019m not that big into football or school spirit which I know is really big at that school. I\u2019m mainly just looking for a close group of friends, which, from y\u2019all\u2019s comments I think I would be able to find a CPP. \n\nAlso for anyone that has graduated from cpp, what was the internship process like? I know it\u2019s required to graduate, at least with an architecture degree, but does the school help you in anyway to find jobs? Like are there people that guide you or a select of jobs that usually employed people from CPP? Or will I pretty much be all on my own with finding an internship?",

OC is a 30 minute drive, LA is 45, the IE is 45, Claremont, Rowland, chino, all 15 minute drives. Big bear 1.5 hours. Hell even downtown is pretty fun, it\u2019s not as ghetto as a lot of people make it out to be.\n\nMeeting people is what you make of it. You will meet all different kinds of people old and young that are just as eager to meet new people like you. \n\nA lot of people I know who have complained that there\u2019s nothing to do at the school didn\u2019t go out too much, always stayed in to study, and their only clubs were more geared towards academics. Nothing wrong with that but some of them wished they were more active with the more fun and social clubs on campus.\n\nWe have Greek life, intramurals, free events that happen every other week, just like any other school. A lot of them do party, a lot of them don\u2019t and do more wholesome activities, a lot of them do both. Our classes can get a little more intimate with the profs. I think it\u2019s great to have smaller class sizes, my average class size was 25-35 people, with a gen Ed class I had be 80+.\n\nIn the end the social scene is what you make of it, plenty of people do a self fulfilling prophecy and just check in and check out of school, I did my first couple years. But if you go out there and find things or people that interest you, you will have fun. It\u2019s only a boring commuter school if you choose it to be",

            "comment": "Arch student here.\n\nI'm a commuter so, I can't really answer about the area. But, I'll try to answer some of your questions about architecture:\n\n1. Architecture is a close-knit community here! You will definitely recognize and interact with your architecture classmates, especially in studio. You'll help each other out (and suffer together). You will have the same architecture (and possibly GE) classes with them throughout the five years (so, don't make any enemies). Also, studio culture is slowly returning after COVID so, you may have some late-nights with your classmates (studio buildings are open 24/7 as long as you have your student ID card to swipe in). You can also meet your fellow second to fifth year undergraduate and graduate students as well! So, don't be shy! Everyone's pretty friendly!\n\n2. Studio is our main design class. You'll need to take it every semester. Studio is not a lecture hall-style class. Rather, it is a very interactive class. You will have your own desk at the Interim Design Center (IDC)/Building 89 and definitely be able to talk with your classmates/neighbors (to see what they're designing, to ask for help, to complement/critique, etc.).\n\nDuring studio time, your studio professor may decide to do pin-ups (everyone prints out their work and pins it to the wall; then you present your work to your section and the section provides comments), desk-crits (1-on-1 discussions with the studio professor), or independent work (basically working on whatever you need to get done). Whatever the studio professor decides to do on studio days, there will be opportunities to talk to your classmates/neighbors!\n\n3. If I recall correctly, there is typically a little more than 100 first-years. It is divided into about 6 sections, taught by different professors, and typically comprised of 15-20 students. It doesn't sound like a lot of students within one section but, we have studio from 2-6 p.m. (either Monday/Thursday cohort or Tuesday/Friday cohort). It is not uncommon for studio to go overtime because the professors need to talk with everyone about their individual design if they do pin-ups/desk crits.\n\n4. You probably don't interact with anyone outside of architecture unless you make friends with someone from GE's, a club, or the dorms. Also, time management is pretty important in architecture so, partying is not recommended. Working while in architecture is quite hard but, not impossible. All nighters should be expected (especially during Midterm and Finals).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Formatting. Also, the ENV buildings are on the edges of campus (IDC, Building 7 and Lyle Center) so, that may also affect not running into people in other majors.",

If things haven't changed, architecture students come from all over the state since it's only one of two public undergraduate accredited professional programs in a state as large as most countries.  As such, a lot of students will live on campus initially and move out to the village apartments also on campus or just off campus.  As part of the accreditation, students are required to have a physical work station on campus meaning they will have their own personal desk where they can work on their projects.  You can find many of the students working at the IDC which is a large warehouse studio building on the edge of campus.  As mentioned elsewhere, each class year is a very tight knit group of 60 or so students that will stay together more or less for the entire 5 years.  I found that being close to Los Angeles was a asset as we are heavily influenced by one of the most vibrant architecture scenes in the country if not the world.  Many of the faculty are practicing architects there.  I would say that's a major feature that would set it apart from Texas A&amp;M which is in a more rural setting.  If you have the chance, you should visit both schools and decide.  Good luck!",

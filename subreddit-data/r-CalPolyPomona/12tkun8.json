Lyle center for regenerative studies is the best space at Cal Poly Pomona and not many people know about it or their minor and master programs. It is located on University, up a hill coming  from the Farm Store. Phase 1 was open in 1994 with 24 dorms for undergraduate and graduate students of all disciplines. It is meant to be a learning center for sustainable and regenerative practices/technology as well as a space for sustainable/regenerative research. My petition to more fully utilize the Lyle Center and start a campus-wide project to build an earthship there will be available at all of the cultural center\u2019s.",

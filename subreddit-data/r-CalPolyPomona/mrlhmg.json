Had what I thought a good group of friends for a class project but all of them turned out to be snakes. Im broke like most college students and I worked manual labor in warehouses all my life and these fuckers made me feel lower than low because I don\u2019t have a new car and someone at home to maintain me. To make it worse I tried my best to get a good grade for all of us during the final presentation by taking on much of talking part and these bitches still gave me a fucken 0/10 when we had to grade group mates. After that I just went straight home and didn\u2019t really talk to much people after class, then COVID hit. I still get randomly heated every time I think about that class because I got a B+ and was only 12 points away from getting to the A. 99.9% of people at school are cool though, I just got screwed over and got small group of bitches.",

The past is just history. You kept on thinking about the past you're gonna get negative feelings everytime. \n\nI didn't make much friends at CPP when I was undergrad if that makes you feel any better. That's because I have a lot of homework and studying to do. I did dorm first year and commute second to fourth year. Secondly, I worked part time in IT related job to build up my resume. Because at the end of the day I'm just getting experiences and knowledge during my 4 years. No need to be so worked up about fitting in or finding some friends that leads me nowhere. \n\nGood and real friends will check in on you from time to time even during the pandemic or lock down. \n\nFast forward to today, I am happy with where I am at now. A lot of friends or some friends doesn't really affect me that much. That's just me. I'd rather have some real friends than a lot of fake friends. At the end of the day, it's what you're happy about.",

I know for a fact that group of people are still looking for a job and I\u2019m one of the lucky few people that got a job offer before I even graduate.

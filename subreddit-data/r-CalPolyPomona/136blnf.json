If you are interested in taking certain professors, it could come in handy. However as of late, professor names have not been listed, so it's more of  a blind bag.   \n\n\nDefinitely might want to seek more information. But from my perspective, if you can handle the workload of architecture and are looking for more, I think it is worth it!",

                    "comment": "Third Year ARC student here,\n\nAs the previous person has said, you will be spending a LOT of time in architecture classes (particularly studio). With that, most of your friends will probably come from the architecture classes as well.\n\nMore than 25% of incoming freshmen (can be more) end up dropping the major because they do not realize how time consuming all of it is. That being said: Holding a part time job will be difficult (unless you have a great work ethic). Come in preparing for all-nighters, skipping meals, and no free time during weekends. Let's also not forget that Architecture is a 5 year major here (minimum) with a 150 unit total. There is no way (that I know of) to speed through architecture school. And to that regard, you probably do not want to either. Personally, architecture school is one of the hardest things I've ever done.\n\nOther than that, be prepared to dish out lots of money on top of your tuition and room &amp; board (if you're paying for that). Common costs will be for model materials (foam core, chip board, etc.), laser cut orders, 3D Print orders, digital software licenses, etc. Bottom line, architecture is NOT cheap.\n\nThough many people say many negative things about architecture as a major, I will say that it is very fulfilling. The cost for an architecture education here is one of the best in the country in terms of return on investment. Many of the faculty have industry experience and many are currently working at many high profile firms (e.g. SOM, Morphosis, Gensler, etc.). I've met some real talented people through the program thus far as well (both faculty and students alike) and have made a lot of good friends. Firms from all over the Greater LA Area also flock to our firm crawls as well, so finding a job afterwards should be easier than it would be otherwise.\n\nThat's all I can think about for now. But if you have questions about architecture school or just CPP from an ARC major's perspective, feel free to send me a DM! I'd be happy to help out! Good luck, my friend.",

I'm seeing a lot of posts about how orientation is when a lot of freshman will receive guidance on what classes to take and will actually get to register for classes. I'm assuming I'd have to email my advisor once they're assigned and ask to schedule a virtual meeting to register classes, but wanted some confirmation. I hope to switch from Urban Planning with a specialty in transportation to Civil Engineering at the end of the school year too",

Students must receive the approval of the chair of the department offering the proposed academic program.*\n\nThe [CS minor has 29 units](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=65&amp;poid=17143&amp;returnto=5519) and the[Physics major has 0-7 unrestricted electives](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=65&amp;poid=17154&amp;returnto=5519#UnrestrictedElectives07Units).

I'd prefer to go to Pomona, but I'm not sure if CPP is worth it if classes are this hard to come by, so I was wondering if while I take civil engineering, would I always have a hard time getting classes for the 4+ years I'm enrolled?",

    "postText": "As someone who doesn't join clubs and engage in that aspect of campus life (and may also have serious RBF), I feel like the only ways for me to meet single guys are either in class or just around campus, but it's not working. Almost everybody has airpods in constantly, and everyone that doesn't is working on something or reading.  I don't take that many classes and I am almost done at CPP, so what am I supposed to do? I am terrified of initiating conversations and just randomly sitting down with someone who is sitting alone, but I sit by myself all the time and nobody approaches me. I totally get it, there isn't anywhere on campus that has a social atmosphere or makes it feel inviting to talk to new people, so what do we do?",

            "comment": "Going to do a serious reply here. You don't do clubs, and sounds like you don't do a sport or any other form of social networking, and you expected to meet someone by....doing almost nothing?\n\nYou have to understand that it's not that CPP has an \"unsocial atmosphere\", its that people are unwilling to engage and do the bare minimum, yourself included. I've met wonderful people through clubs and open gym, but I had to get over the fear of talking to people - and understand that there are people with interests like myself who also are looking for friends.\n\nThe RBF doesn't help sure, but I think you're holding yourself back. Try small and join a discord server on campus of something you like, or try at least once a day talk to someone that maybe has a charm or sticker of something you like. Girls generally have an easier time making conversation as it is harder for you to come off as a creep. Good luck on your stuff!",

There was a girl in a class of mine who I never spoke to til the following semester when we ended up on the same e board. Does your department have their own club? It may go a long way and look good on your CV if that matters to you!",

    "postText": "What are the requirements to be a tutor at the LRC because my tutor just straight out used Chegg during our session????\ud83d\ude43 \nI go there for help and an explanation...not just to be given answers that I could have looked up on my own. I've had some subpar tutoring sessions there in the past and I figured it was just me not asking the right questions. But I was baffled. She even went as far as to tell me that she got lazy towards the end of the semester and didn't even go to class. How are you going to be a tutor and tell me you don't even know what you are doing. \ud83d\ude43\n It's free tutoring. Fine. But damn. That was rough.",

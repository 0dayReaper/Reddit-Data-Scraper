    "postText": "Hello everyone! I recently was accepted to CPP for next fall and am debating whether or not I should commute or live off campus. I currently am about 25 miles away or about a 30 minute drive no traffic (Located in Fontana). I am an older transfer student since I will be 23 by the time fall comes around. Anyways I\u2019m conflicted between moving out or commuting and saving money. I know moving out will be really beneficial for me especially since I am getting too comfortable living at home. But I also don\u2019t want my parents to spend a lot of money on me if they do not need to. My parents are willing to help me get a place if I want to and I also have a couple of friends who are willing to move in with me to help pay for rent but as stated I\u2019m not sure if I should commute and save or live off campus.",

            "comment": "as someone who lived in San Bernardino. Live off campus. The 15 minute drive using streets is a lot easier than the 10/210. Depending on time of day it can take 45-60 minutes to get to/fro Fontana.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful if you become more involved on campus with friends and clubs. Sometimes you don\u2019t want to drive back to the IE after a long day on campus. It also makes taking naps and breaks easier throughout the day if you have a 3 hour gap or something between classes.\n\nThere\u2019s an off campus housing page on Facebook for CPP students if on campus is too expensive. PM me and maybe I can see if I can help, I have a buddy who manages properties in the area",

At the end of the day I\u2019d rather move in with my friends over strangers. But if your friend has a 3 bedroom place he\u2019s willing to rent out lmk!",

There are many benefits to living on or near campus including a better social life, more time to study and explore things at or around campus.  I'm an old time graduate I can say that I've bet a lot of friends, some of whom I still communicate with.  You'll be moving out eventually, so why not now?",

If you need to find more opportunities to push yourself, maybe discover a new hobby. I would probably avoid renting with friends as it can easily turn for the worse. Finding a new living situation mid-semester is not fun. I know commuting sucks--but music streaming and podcasts are getting a lot better these days.  :). Hope this helps a little.",

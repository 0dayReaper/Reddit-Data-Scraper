    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a senior and incoming MechE major at CPP and was just wondering if anyone can provide more information on what AP courses I\u2019ll actually get credit for. I know that at many schools, MechE majors are required to retake classes like physics or calc at the university. Is it the same case at CPP? Would I get any credit or skip any classes if I do well on the Physics C Test?",

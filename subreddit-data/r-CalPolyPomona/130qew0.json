    "postText": "I am an incoming engineering major and I just found out that I have to take a math placement test which is the ALEKS PPL. However, it stated that people who passed their AP Calc AB Exam are exempted from it. The issue is that I am currently taking Calc AB and will take my exam in a few weeks. Should I completely ignore it and not turn anything in and just wait for my AP score to come out? Or should I just take the placement test? If I do pass my Calc AB exam, how do I send it to Pomona to verify? Thank you for your help.",

            "comment": "Take the assessment no matter what. Even if you pass the AP exam, if you don't do it, it'll automatically place you at a college level of algebra by default. Also, if you pass your exam, i believe they send you an email, and you can choose which AP scores to send to your college. You can always ask your counselor for clarification when they send out the AP scores.",

If I took the first unproctored assessment on the Aleks website, do I have to take the second and third one in order for me to take the proctored test? Or can I just complete the learning modules and that would make me eligible to take the proctored test?",

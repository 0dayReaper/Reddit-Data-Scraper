People are still looking short term and not long term. \n  \nI was okay with a 3 week break till spring break. This full semester thing though, as I said from the beginning this is way too much for the courses, at least the ones i'm in, for only online. I'm not getting anywhere near the quality education I was hoping to get and I doubt many others are either. \n  \nLord hopes my future classes don't pull information from the courses I'm taking this semester...  \n  \nEdit: formatting",

I'm at home too, and dealing with all the fun and conflict resolution that comes with having 3 children between the ages of 3-12 at home and stuck with one another day after day.  \n\nI agree that some of what I'm seeing on the sub from my fellow faculty members is excessive and unrealistic given the circumstances.\n\nThat said, one does not take a class fully online with a week's notice.  Being forced (and necessarily so) to do so leads to jerry-rigged, slap-together jobs like we're currently seeing, jerry-rigged, slap-together jobs I might add that many on this sub demanded.\n\nI'm sorry things suck.  I will keep the complaints voiced here in mind for my own course, as there are some glaring problems there arising from a rushed process.",

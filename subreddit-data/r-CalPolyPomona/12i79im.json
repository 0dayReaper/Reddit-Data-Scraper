    "postText": "Hello, I just got accepted into Pomona and UCSD\u2026and i\u2019m currently conflicted on the decision. I got into Pomona as a CS major, which I wanted. I got into UCSD NOT as a CS but into a major that\u2019s kinda related. UCSD gave me a decent financial aid (will have to take out loans :/) and I still haven\u2019t gotten my Pomona financial aid. Pomona is closer to home which my mom wants but I really like the UCSD location. Overall I\u2019m worried about my future job/internship prospects. Tbh\u2026I\u2019m leaning into SD more because it does have a good reputation and I want that campus life. But still interest in CPP tho. Please help",

The connections at both schools are very good, so finding a job wont be super difficult at either one. In my opinion, you are better off going to the school that puts you in the least amount of debt possible, since that will enable you to have greater financial success down the road.",

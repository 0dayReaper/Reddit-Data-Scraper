    "postText": "A silly question, but I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I was applying to schools awhile back and I was wondering if it was possible to change my concentration of a business administration operations management to business administration computer information systems before starting class? I\u2019m currently working in IT and pursuing certifications and I\u2019ve heard that some schools take these certifications as class credit",

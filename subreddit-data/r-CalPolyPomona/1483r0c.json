The rest of the house is shared. Rent is $1200 a month including utilities. Must be okay with dogs and cannabis. No pets. Washer and drier in house. House is located 7 min away from Cal Poly Pomona and is in a gated community. I am also a current Cal Poly Pomona student. Send me a message if interested, thanks!",

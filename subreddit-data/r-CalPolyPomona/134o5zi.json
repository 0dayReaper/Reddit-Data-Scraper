    "postText": "I have a question about the assessment. So I took the first unproctored exam that I am required to take before I get to do the learning modules. I also understand that the fourth exam is the proctored exam. Am I required to take the second and third exams in order to unlock the fourth proctored exam to complete on campus? Or can I just skip the exams, complete the learning modules and the fourth proctored exam will open up by itself?",

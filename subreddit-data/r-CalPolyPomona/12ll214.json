    "postText": "Hello Cal Poly Pomona community! I recently got admitted to the MS in CS program for Fall 2023 and I'm excited to join the campus. I have submitted my e-Request for the I-20 form along with the bank letter and passport more than 10 days ago, but I haven't received it yet. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced a delay in receiving their I-20 form, and if so, what could be the reason behind it? How many days should I wait before taking any further action, or is there anything else that needs to be done to expedite the process? Thank you in advance for any insights or advice!\n\nFYI : I have also tried reaching out to the ISSO (International Students &amp; Scholars Office) and ISA (International Student Advisors) via email, but unfortunately, I haven't received any response from their side regarding the status of my I-20 form.",

Both offices get bombarded with emails on a daily basis. Sometimes it just takes a long time to get through all of them especially depending on how much staff they have. Hope this helps!",

It's deliberately doing something contrary to what they're paid to do - follow the route.",

That\u2019s not something that happens just from dazing off. If I had to guess, either the driver is incredibly incompetent, the bus malfunctioned(unlikely), or something (like a jaywalker) spooked them and made them yank the wheel to the left.",

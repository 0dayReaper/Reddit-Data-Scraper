    "postText": "Finally committed to CPP today, yay! Any advice/things i should know about the architecture department before i start? I do know that its going to be quite hard for the next 5 years but i think i made the right choice for my future. Due to accreditation (B.Arch versus B.A.) and distance to home i picked it over UCSD and UCB. Cannot wait to start!! \n\nAny computer recommendations? I was looking at the Microsoft Surface studio laptop. \n\nAlso! How\u2019s the study abroad program for their architecture? Looks like they have some good choices and it\u2019s definitely something I want to participate in.",

ALSO!! At orientation they will give you specific laptop spec requirements so don't buy anything until then!!!",

It will take a while to learn, but don\u2019t be afraid of these people. They can be jerks sometimes, but it\u2019s useful in learning how to stand by your design.",

Doubly so if you can remote in to use your desktop from your laptop for the computer work.",

            "comment": "First year here! Congrats! I would say that i\u2019ve had a pretty good experience here so you chose a really good school to go to imo.\n\n- get a hard drive, you\u2019re gonna need it \n\n- learn how to manage your time, the work load can be insanely unreasonable at times and if you don\u2019t choose when to prioritize your work when it is needed you\u2019re gonna be stressing out even more than you really need to.\n\n- get to know the people in your studio as they can really help you out during tough times.\n\n- make sure to prioritize sleep. Some people like to glorify pulling all nighters but if you manage your work properly then there really isn\u2019t any need to. There are times when I find myself pretty overloaded with work, but I usually just try to wake up earlier than I normally do to get that work done. I notice that I work a lot more efficiently when I do it in the the morning rather than at 3am. \n\nReally, all it comes down to is really trying to find your footing amidst all the chaos. It\u2019s definitely a learning process and you\u2019ll stumble a lot but it is important that you continue moving forward and push through. \n\nDespite the work that we are given I find myself really enjoying the projects that are given, and if you really have a passion for architecture you\u2019re going to love it here! You can always PM me if you have questions, I am only a first year but I wouldn\u2019t answering some based on my experience. \n\nGood luck! And congrats again!",

I doubt you'll be doing anything that will push the limits of that laptop until your late into your 4th or 5th year.",

Also wanted to create this thread for the people on the 2023 waitlist so they can post any updates to their status so we can all note any chances not only to our own status but to the overall waitlist as well (:",

This place is 3 miles away from CPP and close to/with short walk to bus line 480 to CPP. Rooms are currently occupied by CPP students and so you will be living with other CPP students. Please DM me if you are interested. Thanks!",

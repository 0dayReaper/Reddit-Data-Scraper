I\u2019m graduating this May, when I went to buy my graduation sash and tassel I asked multiple people if I would be under CLASS as sociology which is white or Criminology which is Gold. They all gave me different responses. My major is \u201cSociology with Criminology Option\u201d as it states in my diploma. I ended up buying both colors as someone said I can wear both, but I am not sure if that will seem a bit extra. Anyone else in CRM/SOC major graduating this May know?",

Then there\u2019s the sociology department within the college. Sociology majors can choose general sociology or social work. Criminology majors are under the sociology department but it\u2019s its own major. Then there are the minors/subplan options. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s up to you how you want your grad to go. If you bought them might as well wear them. I doubt anyone\u2019s gonna care :)",

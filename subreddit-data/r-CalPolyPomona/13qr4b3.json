You'll have difficulty getting the classes you need in two separate fields, in majors that are likely impacted and challenging to get courses anyway. Those courses may very well have overlapping times which will further complicate things, you may not be able to declare the 2nd major you want depending on how impacted the 2nd major is, and after your delayed graduation there will be very few benefits to having that extra major on your resume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would spend time deciding exactly where your interests lie in a career field and whether a 2nd major would actually benefit you or not before chasing yourself down this rabbit hole. I would think more about maybe what you want in a graduate degree paid for by an employer down the line maybe. At least then you're not on the hook for more academic time for free.",

            "comment": "Double major and double minor here. My majors are electrical engineering and computer engineering, and my minors are math and physics. Due to the overlap and some AP credit I was able to get this done in 5 years. \nNow that I am graduating, I find myself applying to mostly computer engineering jobs, although some of these jobs include the others as possible eligible majors. I could apply to electrical jobs, but I learned that I preferred a career with computers/programming, making my electrical degree less relevant.\nI think the \"edge\" I got from having these on my resume is minimal, but for an aerospace engineer with CS degree, it might make you a more desirable candidate.( I don't think programming is a popular skill for aerospace engineers, except for MATLAB). On the other hand, if you decide you like CS more, then aerospace engineering will probably not help much.\nThat being said, the satisfaction of completing these  has made it worth it. I'm passionate about math and physics and the minors have further my interest in the subjects. From my experience, I think the thing to weigh most is the time it will take to complete. As most people will tell you, time would be better spent gaining experience on a job or studying towards a master degree. If you are passionate and are willing to stay the extra time then go for it.",

But his class is heavily graded on a few things based around case studies:\n\n1) midterm\n2) case study presentation\n3) case study report (big one)\n4) final\n5) attendance/participation\n\nTo do well in the class you need to understand the case assigned to your group and nail the report. He gives really good feedback to other groups, so pay good attention if you don\u2019t go first.\n\nThe midterm and final aren\u2019t terribly hard, but he asks some MCQ about stupid details in the case such as, \u201cwho was the VP of Sales for  Company A in case 1?\u201d They also contain a few free response questions.",

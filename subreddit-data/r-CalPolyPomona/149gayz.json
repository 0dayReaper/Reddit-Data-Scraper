    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nI was recently accepted to Cal Poly Pomona in May for the Fall 2023 session. I chose CSUF for a public administration major but I\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve had a change of heart. \nIve realized I want to become an Urban Planner and although i technically can do it with my Public Admin degree, I know Cal Poly has a specified Urban Planning program. \n\nI spoke to admissions in which they said they would give me a call back with more information because when I applied, Political Science was my primary program and Urban Planning my secondary.\nThey told me the probable options are either writing an admissions appeal(because i neither accepted nor denied) or re applying for the Spring 2024 semester.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience or know anyone that has? What are my odds? Any info would help!",

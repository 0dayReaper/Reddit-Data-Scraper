A time when my hair was all pepper and no salt.\n\nOn that day, my department started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CPPMechEngTutorials) with a handful of videos. Back then, we simply wanted to share videos with faculty and students easily. During the first year, we were averaging 10 views a day (30 on a good day). But we didn't care. The channel was serving its purpose.\n\nWell, over time we gradually added videos to the channel and (to our surprise) it grew in popularity. The channel is now almost 600 videos strong and averaging 5000-8000 views a day (10k on a good day). During its first 10 years, the channel has accumulated 13.6M views, 1.2M hours of total watch time, and 118k subscribers.\n\nCrazy. Truly crazy.\n\nHappy birthday CPPMechEngTutorials!",

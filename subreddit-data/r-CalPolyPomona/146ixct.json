    "postText": "Roommate had to move out unexpectedly, bummer, so I'm back on my grind trying to find a good roommate. I'm alumni of CPP been living here for 4-5 years. It's a cool place, gated community, lots of parking, pool/jacuzzi/tennis. It's a 2 bedroom spot, 1 restroom, and we have everything you'll ever need in the kitchen. Room is available now, I'm looking to get $900 a month for the 13'x13' rooms. Rent and terms are negotiable. Single occupancy only, overnight guests welcome here and there, unfortunately no animals allowed, unless they live in the room exclusively. I have a fish, he's fucking awesome. Anyways if you need a chill nice place to live send me your info. Have a good weekend. 314 s prospectors rd. Diamond Bar Ca for location reference.",

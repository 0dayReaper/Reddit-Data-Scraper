    "postText": "I just recently had my freshman orientation and had registered in my classes for general civil engineering. During the process, I was told that there must be the same two numbers after the dash in the name for the civil engineering classes I had to take. It is shown as (-03) in the picture. However, I am not sure if this applies for all classes with lectures and labs. Does my chemistry class have to have the same number after the dash or was that just required for my civil engineering classes?",

            "comment": "the numbers after the dash is just different sections. for example, -02 means there are two classes available for the course. idk how it works for orientation, but you can register for any lab section as long as they match the course. based on your schedule, you should be fine.",

I'm pretty sure when I took classes like chemistry, they were different sections because it was certainly different professors.",

Unless I am mistaken, CE 1001 is the ONLY class that requires you to register for the same lecture and lab section. Not sure why. But for all your other classes, you can mix and match section numbers.",

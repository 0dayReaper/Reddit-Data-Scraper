Some useful advice I can give probs is use ratemyprofessor.com, make connections with professors (cause they can probs hold a seat for you in another course and other things as well), talk to other aerospace majors and get advice from them, and honestly just have fun too. Wish the best of luck!",

The 3 big Aero clubs are AIAA, UMBRA, and Bronco Space. Join all 3 and stay involved in all of them. Different opportunities in each for you. \n\nDo projects ASAP, you need experience and CPP Aero has a TON. Ask around especially at the clubs. \n\nNetwork with your classmates and your profs, get to know everyone. Your network = net worth especially in aero. \n\nLastly, make time for the things you enjoy and balance academia with your personal life. You definitely don\u2019t want to get burnt out.\n\nIf you have any other questions, PM me. \n\nI\u2019m CPP Aero Class of 2022 working in industry. Happy to help how I can. And best of luck!",

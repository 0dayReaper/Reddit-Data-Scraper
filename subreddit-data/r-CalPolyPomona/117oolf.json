    "postText": "The title might sound confusing so let me explain.\n\nI\u2019m a CC student majoring in CS. Probably one of the most competitive majors to be majoring in, especially here, so I\u2019m out here losing my mind thinking that I won\u2019t get in. My GPA isn\u2019t what past students (roughly 3.45) had and I\u2019m close, but not within the \u201clocal\u201d range so I won\u2019t get the local advantage. And I can\u2019t do the Associates Degree for Transfer since I applied last fall and only have this spring to take the Physics class I need for that program and I need to take general biology in order for admissions to consider my application. Heck, I don\u2019t even think CPP even has an Associates Degree for Transfer for Computer Science majors. \n\nNow that my freak out is temporarily subsided, I\u2019d like to ask my fellow CS students who followed a similar path I\u2019m going through right now how they got in and what their stats were like GPA, extracurriculars, and other factors like being local. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m freaking out and I only have one week to decide what to do. I\u2019d appreciate it at this point if any former transfer students shared their experience getting in and things like that so I can make a somewhat cohesive plan. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk.",

(Lets just say 2.6) I transferred from Chaffey to CPP. \n\nMy experience is different because I am not in a STEM major lol. However my transfer experience was difficult just bc I went through an grading issue with an professor while in community. I needed the class to transfer. But my professor graded my paper last minute and told me how my file was corrupted. I was failing the class, but I made a report about how this was unfair since the assignment was due a month ago. Anyway, took forever going through documents because they were wrong when they were transferred to CPP. Saying I failed the class and cant transfer, but finally got the right transcript on my own because they sent the wrong one ugh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry my experience is different and not very helpful but hey youre not alone the system sucks",

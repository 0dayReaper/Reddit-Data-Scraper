    "postText": "TL;DR: UCI offers 36k/year. Is CPP still better financially? For mechanical engineering major.\n\nI\u2019m transferring from a community college and CPP is my top choice for mechanical engineering because I have heard that CPP has a lot of hand-on projects and cheaper compared to the UCs. Plus, CPP let me minor and doesn\u2019t have units cap or quarter cap (basically a limit on how many units and quarters you could take).\nBut now UCI gives me a really good financial package which is 36k/year without loan (haven\u2019t factored in UC blue and gold scholarship).\n\nI didn\u2019t apply for CPP this year. But I will next year and CPP is still one of my top choices.\n\nMy question is, with a financial package like that should I go UCI instead? Or would CPP still better in term of finance?\n\nThank you.\n\nI appreciate your help.",

UCI base tuition is also higher than CPP, so it just depends on how much financial aid you expect to get from UCI. \n\nCPP does have a unit cap, although you can take more than that cap, you just can't sign up for more until two weeks before classes start, when they are all full.",

            "comment": "It depends. If the one that UC cover 36K could cover your tuition fee with out you need to pay out of pocket why not. But if you go cpp the tuition fee for one semester was around $3700 and as I know the financial aid gives you around $6000. Which is enough to cover your tuition fee + books. Besides, you can still enter to get the scholarships. Cpp offer a lot of scholarship to help student with their financial which is great. So if you are not awarded the financial aid don\u2019t be worry because you still have the scholarship and you can also apply for the middle class scholarship. So think about if Uc could cover all of your expenses. If UC cant cover it, you better switch to CPP. Also cpp offer a networking and career fair which can help you with your future job~",

            "comment": "Hey OP,\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had to make this same decision but for computer science. I have an EFC of 0 and so the financial aid packages were gonna be heavy, and likely the deciding factor.  \n\n\nCPP offered me their financial aid first, and simply put, offered me about $8K above the cost of tuition and fees, so essentially getting paid $8000 per year to attend CPP.  \n\n\nIrvine offered theirs a few weeks later, and even with the tuition and fees coming out to nearly double the cost of CPP, their financial aid package was so robust that they paid out $13k above the cost of their tuition and fees.  \n\n\nIn my case, the commute to CPP would be manageable, but the commute to UCI would be a soul-sucking 3 hours back and forth alongside a quarter-million other people every day. The housing cost at UCI will eat up pretty much the entirety of that extra $13k they offered me, though, so that is something to consider.  \n\n\nMy two cents.",

When I lived in the suites, I still had to pay an extra amount out of pocket after my all loans and grants (since it wasn\u2019t enough). I was EFC 0 too. It was also because I was living in a single room though. But I definitely would take that into consideration.",

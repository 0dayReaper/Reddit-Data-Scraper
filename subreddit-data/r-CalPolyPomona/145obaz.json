I lived on campus, so it was easy to walk around at any time and play the game with other friends who lived on campus. Community days are also great for meeting other players. \n\nAnd this may sound weird, but some professors/TAs play the game. My bio lab professor would tell me when there were special events, so I could evolve my Pokemon and get more stardust. The best lab professor I had last semester. \n\n(Especially because there was an Eevee event, and I am trying to evolve and collect all of them)",

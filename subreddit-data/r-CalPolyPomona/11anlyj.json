Double checked my direct deposit it is correct. It stated on my 1098-T that I received it even tho there was none. What should I do?",

The $2700 doesn't include the MCS. It says that i should've receive at least $3800 total. And I don't have any loans, so idk what happened.",

This was their explanation to me:\n\n\u201cThe California Student Aid Commissioner (CSAC) identified the student as being eligible for the Middle Class Scholarship (MCS) for the Spring 2023 school year. However, the recent receipt of the MCS affected their eligibility for federal loans. A student is only eligible for federal and state financial aid up to their specific Cost of Attendance (COA) as determined by the school. The COA is the summation of your tuition and mandatory student fees plus an estimation of housing, books and supplies, personal expenses and the cost of transportation for the academic year. Prior to receiving the MCS, the other financial aid that was available to the student had reached, or nearly reached the COA. Once the amount from the MCS was added to the existing offer, our office had to reduce your PLUS loan in order to ensure the overall financial aid offer did not exceed the COA. The portion of your loan that was reduced will be canceled with your lender, reducing the overall loan debt. Therefore, although you were provided the total amount of your MCS offered through CSAC, the amount of your refund was reduced as all or a portion of it was applied to the balance that would have been created by the canceled loan.\u201d",

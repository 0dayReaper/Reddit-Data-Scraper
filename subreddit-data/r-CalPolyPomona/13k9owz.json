All seriousness though if you want to take a GE there over the summer, which I would recommend because it\u2019s about a quarter of the price and free if you if get financial aid, you need to apply asap because it takes a couple weeks to process the application and summer session is going to start soon. Think you only have till like the 2nd or third session of a class to add during summer.",

I don't think making a blanket exemption for covid exposure--given its 10 day window-- is really formidable with the standardized format of a 16 week course. That's missing a good chunk of the course and exposure can happen multiple times in a semester. The doctors note seems excessive--making me believe this professor is having some kind of issue with getting students to pass this class. Again, CYA #1 on the list. Making two versions of a course (one for online and one for in-person) is doable, but irritating for professors. Some have major issues with making the quality and equity possible. Some have technical handicaps or are not in-tune with the constant change of software programs they need to learn to stay relevant. The easiest way to prevent this is just make students come to class. I think a lot of it boils down to legal exposure as their primary goal is to educate you and prove to the state you retained the information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think I've ever ordered it either. CPK does a decent Hawaiian BBQ chix pizza though..",

Adjunct professor's have a lot less influence in the department and will bend to the student's needs more likely than not. I think the most important thing to keep in mind is-- what does a grade mean in real-life? If quarantining without a doctor's note affects your ability to graduate or take the subsequent course you need--making petitions to the department chair or the dean is a really smart way to go. For example, if you were on the cusp of passing and this made you not pass, absolutely argue for/petition your case. Getting students out (graduating) is really important to programs. If this is just about getting a certain GPA for graduate school, etc, unfortunately, I think the professor has the high-ground.",

It is not necessary, per medical advice, for people to confirm exposures with a PCR test, which is the only thing a doctor will do. You cannot confirm that you do not have covid until 3-5 days after exposure.\n\n*edited for spelling, oops",

Providing proof for COVID can come in many forms for many different professors. Some may ask for a simple positive at-home test while some may ask for a doctor's note. If you do unfortunately get COVID and do happen to get Paxlovid, that's a great way to show a professor that you have COVID but nowadays COVID is becoming like any other sickness where teachers expect some form of proof. I wish each teacher's attendance policy (if they have an attendance policy) was mandated to allow students a certain number of sick days. I've had a professor drop my attendance grade by 7 percent because I missed one day as I got a terrible stomach bug and had to rush to the Student Health Center to get IV fluids and anti-nausea medication. I sent him my doctor's note saying that I should go home and rest and I was excused from any activity including class and he still didn't excuse it. There should be some general reform to attendance policies.",

According to CPP safer return guidelines I can still come to campus even though I was literally exposed to him every single day up until he tested positive. He tested with an at-home test and there was no doctor involved. How am I supposed to explain to my doctor that they need to verify my exposure to someone else's COVID case that was not diagnosed by that practitioner?\n\n\nUpdate: I am now showing symptoms but it hasn't been long enough since most recent exposure to reasonably expect a positive test result.",

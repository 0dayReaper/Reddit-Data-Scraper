It threw away any history CPP had, looked like a logo for a pharma company, etc. I got bored last night, so I went ahead and took a stab at redesigning it myself. Lmk what you guys think.

It\u2019s also a bit oversized too.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the logo mark, it would translate much better if it was a more simplier, but i appreciate the detail. Not in love with it being primarily white while the logo type is primarily gold. Try flipping one or the other around to stay consistent.",

I wanted to choose a typeface that wasn't too dated but not too current without copying CP SLO's branding. What actually happened was I ended up drawing out each letter individually without any real typographic knowledge, so the results are pretty bad lmaooo.\n\nI tried flipping the color on the wordmark to white and I agree, the lockup does look better when the colors are consistent. I'll keep playing around and see what comes out lol, but I really appreciate the feedback :)",

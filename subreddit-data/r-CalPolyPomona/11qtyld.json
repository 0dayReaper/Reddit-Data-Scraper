In terms of graduating, a D is passing so long as it\u2019s not a pre req.\n\nIn my honest opinion grades do and don\u2019t matter depending on where you\u2019re going ie: spacex, FAANG, other big names. In my own experience, experience can carry the weight of a bad GPA. Reason why I\u2019m a firm believer that grades don\u2019t matter as much is I graduated with a 2.8 last year but now I work for a big aerospace company. I am fortunate enough to have this opportunity and I firmly believe my two years interning at an aerospace company and my senior project helped me get the opportunity I have for my career.\n\nOnce you graduate, very rarely do people care for your grades",

If they\u2019re not seniors, then students should be thinking of scholarships as well would usually have a GPA cut off of a 3.0.",

However, it is still possible to get into grad school with a sub 3.0. It\u2019ll be hard but still doable. It just depends on where and what you\u2019re applying to as each school and program has different requirements",

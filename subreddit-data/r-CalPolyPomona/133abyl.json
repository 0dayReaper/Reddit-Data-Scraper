    "postText": "One of the things I miss about college was being able to have a group of 30 all go to dinner and taking over an entire section of the spot.\n\nIt was a coordination of speaking with one guy that spoke for the rest of his particular group via phone (no cell phones yet).  We would all end up either picking each other up or meet in an area so we could join each other.\n\nI miss those days.\n\nEating with a group that big isn't the norm nowadays but we did it a few times a week.\n\nThose were some good times.",

We had our fun but we weren't dicks on leaving our dirty dishes there.\n\nI was a student manager at Los Olivos for a year or two and I worked all positions.  I was a dishwasher for a summer, a cooks assistant, juice man, sandwich maker, food server, and the doorman in the first floor that scanned everyones card and of course let people go up with no problems.",

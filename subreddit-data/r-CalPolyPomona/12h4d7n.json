    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am a sophomore that got accepted to Computer Science, to Cal Poly Pomona. I\u2019m currently at SFSU, which lacks faculty in my opinion and there\u2019s no social life here, it honestly feels like a bigger high school since I\u2019m a commuter. This is the main reason for me wanting to transfer. I many have to do some extra courses which will make me fall back a little bit (maybe a semester). \n\nMy question is, is CPP worth it to transfer to? Some people say that it\u2019s an amazing school for engineering. Is that the same for computer science? \n\nHonest thoughts?\n\nThanks.",

I'd say both do feel like a bigger high school to me as well. \n\nI wanted to join clubs but couldn't get myself to do it because I live 45 minutes away from Cal Poly. I'd say the CPP campus is nicer and newer than SFSU.\n\nI'd say there's chill vibes here and it's easy to chat people up in classes and what not. And there are a ton of CPP events that go on that you can attend.\n\nJust be prepared to drive a bit to anywhere you want to go. Everything feels farther away unlike the bay",

Remind u Cal Poly Pomona is still a commuter school but I would say it's not bad as others. If u gonna live on campus, making friend and socializing won't be bad but if u live off-campus or commuting long distance, it will be hard like at any other college.",

            "comment": "MOST CSU campuses feel like high school. Not all of them. CPP is very much a commuter campus. This should not be a reason to transfer unless you're commuting from Modesto every day. With CSU impaction across Southern California, people are driving further to access whichever school will have them. I'd say, if you have family support near CPP it may totally be worth the transfer. Times are tough and the forecast is offering worse news.\n\nOtherwise, compare the roadmaps for your major at CPP/SFSU and see how much more work you'd need to do at CPP.  If you're just getting started on Major work in CS then it may not be that much extra work. However, there appear to be very few classes that transfer to CPP under the CS major. Check [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) or Transferology to see what may\\* transfer for you from SFSU.   \n\n\nI am not a CS major but have known CS majors to go on to good roles with great companies and some evil ones too.   \n\n\nCongrats and Good luck!",

That given, I think I might fall behind about a year. Is there any way to avoid this? I talked to an academic counselor and she said something about orientation day after committing to the campus, but I want to check before committing. Can you petition your way out of having to retake any courses?",

If there is added courseload you may be able to take summer classes in 2024. There seems to be quite a bit offered this summer but who knows if that will be the same next year. Summer classes can also be really expensive. \n\nPetitioning is a thing but you'll have to wait for the Transfer eval to see which transfer credits they accept. Once you're in though, I found advisors to be super helpful and the petition process is pretty straightforward.  \n\nhttps://tinypic.host/i/oklnw8",

Sit there while they do their speeches and then you line up for them to call out your name and you do the little walk. I think it was like only 2 hrs long.\n\nEdit: No you don't have to show up for any other ceremonies and yes the bookstore is open during the ceremonies so you can buy some graduation stuff.",

You'll get your QR code from marchingorder.com and you'll use this both when checking in an hour before and right before you walk up on stage, so make sure you have it. \n\nAccording to them, guests from your specific time slot can start seating an hour before.\n\nIt's a 90-minute long ceremony. 30 for speech and exactly or just under 1 hour for name calling.\n\nAccording to someone on here, the bookstore will be open from 7am to 7pm. \n\nYou should find that email.",

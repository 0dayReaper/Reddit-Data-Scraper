Make sure you take everything you can at your cc (if you are at one). I wish I would have taken statics at my CC instead of waiting and taking it a CPP (essentially it was like a wasted semester I could have moved on to the next course). Also when you meet with your counselor make sure you ask for a roadmap. It's a good visual to see what some pre-reqs are and to make sure you are taking classes in order and on track",

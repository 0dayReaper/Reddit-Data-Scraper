    "postText": "hi, so I'm still deciding which college to commit to. right now I'm looking at Pomona and cu Boulder. the problem for pomona is, I was admitted for my alternate major which is plant science. at Boulder I was admitted for molecular and cellular biology.\n\nPomona would be much cheaper for me than boulder (since I'm a California resident), but I would only want to go to Pomona if I have a chance to switch into the biology major since I want to focus on genetics and molecular biology. i don't think I would want to study plant science since i don't really see it as my path for the future.\n\nI was wondering if it would be particularly hard for me to get the switch into biology from plant science in my first or second year and if the degree from cu boulder would be more useful for my career than the one from pomona. \n\nI would really appreciate any advice and/or information!! thank you! :(((",

As for my personal experience, I switched majors 3 times and each time to an equally competitive major (fun fact: I was also a bio major for like a semester), and I never had any issues with switching majors as long as I met the minimum requirements. I will say that the impacted majors usually take a decent amount of time to accept you. For two of the majors I switched into, it took me almost 2 months before I got accepted. \n\nIf it helps you feel better, I also barely met the requirements and I got into every single major I switched into, all which were impacted besides one of them.",

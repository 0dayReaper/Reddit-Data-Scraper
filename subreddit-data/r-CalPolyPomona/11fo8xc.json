I\u2019m completing the form right now however my parents do not help me financially for school or other expenses although I live in their home but do not pay rent. I do not want to provide my parents information because i won\u2019t receive financial aid &amp; I kinda need it\u2026 so my question is who is familiar with the process on how to work my way around this. \nI\u2019m currently filling it out with the \u201cI am unable to provide information about my parents\u201d but am unsure of the process after submitting.

Just good info for people to know right here. \n\nStraight from the IRS website \n\"To claim your child as your dependent, your child must meet either the qualifying child test or the qualifying relative test: To meet the qualifying child test,\u00a0your child must be younger than you and either younger than 19 years old or be a \"student\" younger than 24 years old as of the end of the calendar year.\"",

    "postText": "The emails went out yesterday to which wave you are in to get a room for housing suites, the newsletter on the 10th said if you don\u2019t get an email assume you\u2019re on waitlist.\n\nI didn\u2019t get an email but turned in my application about 2-3 hours after it opened because I had a class in the morning. \n\nI\u2019m assuming I\u2019m waitlisted but confused on what to do next because I can\u2019t commute. I also have to wait till April to know which spot I\u2019m on the waitlist so I don\u2019t know if I should stay and hope or try something else.\n\nIs anyone familiar with the process or have been in a similar issue before?",

She said that there was high traffic on the site that morning and many got their application in at exactly 7:30. She was pretty confident in saying she would get appointments out by 5pm on Monday too. I was able to get mine in at 7:31 but the site was slow. I got my appointment on Monday through email. If you are for sure on the waitlist, what I did last year was explain my situation. I told them I had to live on campus and that I can\u2019t commute because I won\u2019t have a car and live hours away. I think they put a note on my account and it bumped me up the waitlist. I got into the dorms, so I kept calling and waited for someone to cancel from the suites and eventually got a room in the suites around July.",

            "comment": "i emailed housing, and it was a little confusing, but to be considered for housing, you have to pay the deposit or defer on top of submitting the application. I did not receive and email, nor did my roommates, and i submitted it at 7:36 on March 1st and payed only 2 days later. my best guess is when you payed effects your position on the list. I do not know what is going on, from the email they said that after all the room appointments go out they may do a 4th wave or manually assign students",

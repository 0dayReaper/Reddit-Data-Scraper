However I am most likely going to end my second semester of senior year with a D in my AP statistics class. I\u2019ve been freaking out because I can\u2019t find an answer anywhere if my app will be rescinded. AP stats is not a required a-g so I hope a D won\u2019t affect my acceptance. Can anyone reassure me on this?",

Hell, I got in as a transfer with an unverified \u201cgolden 4.\u201d If you\u2019re stressing, reach out to registrar and ask if your situation would be grounds to rescind. Congrats and good luck!",

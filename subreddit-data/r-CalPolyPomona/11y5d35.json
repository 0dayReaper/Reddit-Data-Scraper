    "postText": "I was recently accepted to Cal Poly Pomona for my backup major mathematics. Does this mean I was denied admission for computer science? I was really looking forward to attending this school and I am also a transfer student so I thought I would have a better chance but I do understand computer science is impacted. Any suggestions or thoughts on what I should do would be greatly appreciated :)",

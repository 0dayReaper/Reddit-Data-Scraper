There's a curriculum sheet (I think that's what it's called) that tells you what classes to take per semester that takes into account prerequisites. That being said, classes and preferred professors fill up fast so def have a running list of classes you want to take. \n\nYou can take GE's at any CC during  Summer/Winter so don't waste your money at CPP. But def talk to an advisor.",

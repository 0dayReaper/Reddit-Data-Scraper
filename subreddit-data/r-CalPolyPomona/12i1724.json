    "postText": "I committed to Cal Poly Pomona for architecture! However I was wondering if there\u2019s any actual difference between Cal Poly SLO and Cal Poly Pomona in their architecture programs. I got waitlisted at SLO, and don\u2019t know if I should consider it or not. \n\nI really like the location and proximity to home at Pomona, the cost, and that its a great program. \n\nEveryone from SLO tells me that their program is better but all i see is more expensive, and only job opportunities in the bay area. \n\nI think I\u2019ll stick with Pomona even if I do get into SLO, because I don\u2019t think its worth it to spend extra thousands for an architecture degrees. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!! Thank you all:)",

Excellent faculty, Los Angeles is a global center for architecture every important firm has CPP grads working there.  SLO runs a separate program to expose their students to LA.  CPP is the best pathway to a career in architecture in Southern California.",

            "comment": "SLO folks will say everything is better there.  Reality is that some things are just different.  As a Pomona grad, I would say the biggest advantage is being in the Los Angeles area where we have a very vibrant architecture and cultural scene.  Most of the instructors are currently practicing professionals at good firms or have firms of their own.  The tenure faculty are basically professional instructors and they've taught at the program for decades.  The more interesting instructors are actually the part time ones.  They're typically the practicing architects of whom you can visit their actual buildings and offices.  Some instructors also make the rounds with other area schools such as USC, Sci-Arc and UCLA keeping the selection fresh.  You also have some of the best architects in the world come for [Monday night lectures](https://neutra-vdl.org/info/richard-neutra-award).  The school owns the famous [Neutra VDL House](https://neutra-vdl.org/) which will be very influential in your education.  Check it out.\n\nIt's not to say that SLO faculty isn't as interesting but now that I've been practicing for a while, I would find it hard for them to actually have access to clients and projects out there. SLO is a beautiful place.  I can see retiring there someday.",

Yeah I thought that being near LA would probably give me better local opportunities, since I don\u2019t necessarily need national prestige to go work right in the same county. I saw that a Disney imagineer is doing a lecture this week at CPP and I was so impressed! Very excited to attend this school for the next 5 years\ud83d\ude0a",

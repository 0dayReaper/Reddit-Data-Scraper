    "postText": "Hello! My friend and I currently rent a 3 bed 1 bath house in Ontario about a 20min drive from campus and we are looking for a third roommate to move in around late July, early August. You would pay $867/month in rent plus utility costs which we split evenly. We are both guys who don't drink much and never party or smoke, we would prefer someone that doesn't smoke either. We are mechanical engineering majors going into our 4th year; but, we won't be graduating until 2025. Our third roommate will be moving out because he graduated this year and thus we need a new third to take his place so we can continue renting the house. Please DM me if you are interested and would like more details. Thank you.",

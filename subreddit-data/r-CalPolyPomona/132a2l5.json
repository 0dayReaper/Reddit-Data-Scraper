    "postText": "Hello! Incoming freshman here. For housing, I was wondering how likely it is to get a single in the dorms. In my housing application I have my first two options as singles in residential and traditional. I was also wondering if I could appeal the housing decision for special circumstances (mostly medical). Im trying to get an idea of how competitive it is to get them and if I have a way to change my odds.",

            "comment": "I had him last fall semester. The class is tough and the material used to be taught in 2 semesters but crammed into 1. He does curve based on how bad people do which for my class, the avg on tests is in the 50% range. \n\nHe says that as long as you get 60% of the material you\u2019ll be good. Idk if he\u2019s changed his guidelines for tests but there was no cheat sheet allowed for formulas so we had to memorize it. Only the use of the financial calculator was allowed. \n\nTests and quizzes will always be in person. Quizzes dates aren\u2019t posted and we usually found out if we were having one at the beginning of class. Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions!",

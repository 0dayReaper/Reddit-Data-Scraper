I was wondering if anyone had any pro and cons for cal poly ponoma related to my major, or any advice/experiences which would help me choose. Thank you so much!",

Here there have been tons of opportunities to meet representatives from companies in the area which is cool. But I haven't gone to any events like that.  I think you would enjoy either, it is what you make of it.\n\nAlso, if you want to live on campus vs. off campus and commute is another consideration to make. Cal Poly, unless you live on campus, there are very few off campus options where you don't need a car.",

    "postText": "Im in  community college (2nd year) and I was recently accepted to a CPP for business admin. I have 60+ units and my golden 4 are completed.and my gpa is 3.5+ and I already sent in my transcript. 2 of the classes Im currently in are classes Im taken to satisfy assist requirement's for another university(CALC 2 and a CS course at my cc). Those 2 classes Im taking are not required/recommended. Would it be ok for me to drop those 2 classes and take the W on my transcript? I also have the chance to enroll in \"2nd 8 week\" classes for the remainder of the semester so I could take classes that actually have to do with my major. without these two classes I still meet the minimum requirements. Ive talked to my cc counselors and admissions at the CSU and they gave a vague answer said it would have little effect on my admission. Would my admission  be revoked?",

I dropped my last classes at my CCC that wasnt required as I had 60units, the golden 4, and the required classes for transferring into the major. And still got accepted. But again, try to make sure again with an CPP admission. Good luck.",

Just for reference, I was transferring to an impacted major and got accepted with just the classes i completed . I would suggest try talking to a different person in the admissions I think you can do that by asking them nicely.",

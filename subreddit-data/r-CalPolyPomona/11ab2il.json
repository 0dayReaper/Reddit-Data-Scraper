Everyone I know with a Dell XPS eventually learns that it was not worth it.   \n\n\nMacbook Pro on the other hand, I've had no issue. Lenovos - no issues.  \n\n\nHonestly, the closest laptops probably to Macbook in terms of support and reliability are probably the Razerblades and Lenovo carbons and a few other lenovos. But even then, Macs are probably still in the lead.   \nAlso, fun fact: [https://www.schmidtlaw.com/dell-laptop-fire-lawsuit/](https://www.schmidtlaw.com/dell-laptop-fire-lawsuit/)  \n\n\nYes. Dell laptops have caught on fire including the XPS. The XPS was a premium priced laptop using trash parts.",

And I don't think it's relevant in 2023. I have no issues at all as far as I'm using my Dell XPS. And this laptop just launched last year.\n\nUnless you have a recent article or proof that this specific model is \"trash\", I don't think it's fair if you trash talking the brand as a whole. But I also appreciate that at least you had a reason why you didn't like Dells in the first place.",

Its also been known within the dell community that Dell has been using cheap parts for their premium line product. Their customer service has been terrible from my own personal experience. I don't need a study to tell me that Dell's service sucks when they won't fix a laptop that is clearly under warranty.",

But doing a recall is a much much better solution than telling me that my heating issue(so hot i swear I could've almost cooked an egg and had to use a laptop cooler at all times) and the use of a terrible wifi card that keeps disconnecting are \"Windows software problem\" during warranty.  \n\n\nOver the years, I've noticed that customer service in general has gone down so much that my expectation has gone so low that if a company has any amount of decent service I call it a win. And thats why I also switched from Samsung to Apple for mobile devices because Samsung wouldn't honor their warranty either.",

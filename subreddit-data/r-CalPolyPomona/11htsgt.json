    "postText": "I got admitted to Calpoly Pomona and for i20 I need to show financial proof, so I applied for loan but for loan I need to have an i20 document, so it is a kind of a cycle. I saw some videos on YouTube and they said I can get the amount from my Friends and family for 1 day and get the account balance certificate from the bank and that would be sufficient to get i20, I want to know whether it is possible or not. I am very stressed and out of options right now.\nPlease help. Please help.",

I suggest you to ask the international office (maybe try calling them). \nWhy don\u2019t you apply to more than one loan, after you can decide which one to get? I mean apply to one that doesn\u2019t require I20.",

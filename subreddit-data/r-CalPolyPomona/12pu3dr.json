If you already know the material sure it'll be easy and I'd recommend it if you're like an EE, but starting with no knowledge was the worst. She didn't teach, disguised as \"flipped learning\" and then when that didn't work she switched tactics to having us learn the material at home and then we came in and she had us quiz each other while she sat I the corner. \n\nAt one point I asked the kid sitting next to what his grade was and he laughed and said \"D-, I just wanna graduate\" and then I turned to the kid on the other side for the same question and he said \"man this is so easy I've got an A+\"....I ended with a B for the record",

They are the exact same questions as the homework with different numbers. I would take Tung if you\u2019re looking for a good overall class, but if you\u2019re looking for an easy A and don\u2019t really care i\u2019d take Tzounis.",

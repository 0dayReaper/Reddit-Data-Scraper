When you first go inside the greenhouse, there will be a few cages with different creatures like an iguana, skink, gecko, snake, and chameleon! There\u2019s also two caiman in the greenhouse, sometimes they\u2019ll be outside their pool of water if you\u2019re lucky!",

Problem is you only can go up there if a teacher takes you up there as like a class trip or if you volunteer up there. Professor Lappin has taken us up there and he likely knows the info if you wanted to volunteer because otherwise idk if the school has like a directory for the vivarium, it's not really known",

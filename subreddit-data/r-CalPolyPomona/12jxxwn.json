We are a group of Apparel Merchandising and Management students conducting research that is seeking to gain an understanding of **Gen Z\u2019s purchase intentions** toward **high-end luxury brands** versus **affordable luxury brands**.\u00a0\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could take a few minutes to complete our survey, as this will help us gather data for our research.

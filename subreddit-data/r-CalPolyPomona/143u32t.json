    "postText": "I originally applied and was accepted as an architecture major, but I think I would thrive more in the engineering field. Has anyone had any experience changing to an ME major? I know people emphasize how impacted it is and how difficult it might be to switch. As long as I meet the GPA requirements and core class requirements, will I have much difficulty?",

            "comment": "My best friend transferred from Chem E to Mech E, here is what she said: \n\nIt\u2019s very easy to transfer if you have a high GPA and A\u2019s in PHY 1510 and MAT 1140/1150. \n\nI transferred second semester of college with a 4.0, though make sure you submit application to change on time, which is by 5th week of Spring Semester. \n\nSo I\u2019d recommend not taking any hard classes other than the required ones to transfer. Also, if you\u2019re not an ME major you can\u2019t get into the solidworks or matlab courses. I asked multiple professors for add codes and it\u2019s against the policy because being an ME major is a pre req for those classes. But once you transfer in it\u2019s easy to catch up, in the mean time finish the math series. \n\nAlso, you can take MFE 2010/L without being an ME major, and that\u2019s a required course later on. Though I think I would have benefitted more if I took it later on in my 3rd or 4th year since you just have a lot more context for it. \n\nFor reference here was my schedule so far in regards to ME and grade breakdown. Note I had AP credit for MAT 1140 so I didn\u2019t take it 1st semester. \n\n1st Semester: \n\t\u2022\tMAT 1150: with Silverstein, Grade A\u2014 I\u2019ve heard Castro is teaching this class now and I loved him for Calc 3 so I\u2019d recommend him for Calc 2 also\n\t\u2022\tPHY 1510: My professor retired, Grade A \u2014 I\u2019d look at Rate My Professor to see who to get\n\t\u2022\tTook 5 other classes as GE\u2019s/ for fun/ GPA booster\u2019s - All A\u2019s\n\n2nd Semester: \n\t\u2022\tMAT 2140: I had Castro, very good teacher, lots of homework though, Grade A\n\t\u2022\tPHY 1520: Benzhara is dope if you can get him, Grade A\n\t\u2022\tMFE 2010/L: Davis for both lab and lecture, love him, super sweet guy, Grade A \n\t\u2022\tTook some other GE\u2019s, Grade A\u2019s \n\nMid Spring Semester I submitted my change of major form and was accepted into ME by March 26th ish I think. So, I could sign up for ME classes over summer or next fall. \n\nI had signed up for ME 1001L, ME 1101, ME 1101L but I think they were canceled to low enrollment so went for Differential Equations and Linear Algebra instead over summer. \n\nOver summer: \n\t\u2022\tMAT 2240: Von Bremen, super sweet professor , very easy too\n\n3rd Semester: \n\t\u2022\tME 1001: Yuan, easy class\n\t\u2022\tME 1101/L: Woods, also easy, but note this class isn\u2019t to learn Matlab/VBA, it\u2019s a method of introducing programming \n\t\u2022\tME 2141: Izadi, retired but probably coming back, good and easy professor, take him for ME 2191 too if you can, go to office hours",

            "comment": "I switched to ME in my first year. Wasn't too bad. Make sure your GPA is high (I recommend 3.5 or higher). Focus on getting As in Physics 1510/1520 and the Calculus 2 course so I recommend you do some research in getting a good professor to make it easier for you. Also if you are for sure you want to do Mechanical I suggest taking the Mathlab and Solidworks classes as well.   \n\n\nI also went to talk with the department chair as well way before I did my application but I am not sure if that helped or not. you can dm if you have any other questions",

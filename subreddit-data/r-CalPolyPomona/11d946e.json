    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m an international student and I\u2019m not feeling 100% confident with my writing and English. I don\u2019t write a lot on my homework\u2019s, because I\u2019m civil engineering graduate student. However, it would be great to have some support. \nDo you guys think the Writing center would be a good source to check my homework writing? Also, is there any other (free) source for international students in terms of English ?",

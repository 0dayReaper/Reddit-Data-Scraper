The Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies is a little known gem on University up the hill from the farm store. We are petitioning to have it revitalized and utilized. If you care about sustainability or want more interdisciplinary research opportunities, you must support this movement! The petition will be available at the cultural centers and college offices. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\nEdit: shameless plug \u263a\ufe0f",

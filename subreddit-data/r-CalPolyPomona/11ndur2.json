    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just got accepted into Cal Poly Pomona's MSBA and I'm super stoked about it. I wondered if anyone here has further insights into the program and its curriculum. Specifically, if there are any courses that cover (advanced) machine learning and if the curriculum meets contemporary industry needs. I couldn't find any courses that specifically mention machine learning and I'm looking to work as a data analyst or marketing research analyst.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated! Thank you, and have a good day.",

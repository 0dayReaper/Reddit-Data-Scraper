    "postText": "Hello! I am stuck between choosing two colleges and they are Cal Poly Pomona and UCI. However, I am not sure where to go so I would like some input. I am majoring in Civil Engineering for both schools. However, CPP is a farther transportation for me than UCI and I plan to commute to both. But the tuition for CPP is way cheaper than UCI. Additionally I am a student who likes to focus more on classes rather than participating in clubs and extracurriculars. I also plan to get a job right after I graduate and maybe get my masters later on. Does anyone have some advice for me that can give me a bigger idea of what college is best for me? Those who read this thank you and have a great rest of your day!",

UCI is a much more beautiful and fun campus, but it seems based on your writing that isn\u2019t your focus so save the money. Engineering is central to CPP, it makes more sense imo.",

I would say UCs on the otherhand are more theory-based and not as much \"learn by doing.\" This can give you a more holistic approach in the industry.\n\nI would say management and people in leadership positions often come from a UC, and great engineers (not in leadership positions) come from Cal Polys. Obviously not everyone that goes to a UCI or CPP fits into either one of those molds but just a trend I've noticed.",

This means you are more likely to have larger classes &amp; TAs teaching at UCs. Doesn\u2019t mean every professor at a CSU is amazing, but it is something to consider.",

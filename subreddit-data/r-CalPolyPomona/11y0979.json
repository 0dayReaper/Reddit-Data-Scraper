I got lots of research experience, made lots of connections, and the faculty were great. \n\nI would do as others have said and search the sub for answers regarding your questions, but if you nave more specific questions feel free to dm me!",

I LOVE CPP and owe it, and all of the amazing staff and professors who helped/pushed me, a huge part of my success. \nIf you\u2019re nervous about what comes next don\u2019t be. As above commenter said they\u2019re at a PhD at UCD, I am also a PhD student at Johns Hopkins, and a lot of my friends (who, granted, were masters students) are PhD students at USC, Cedars, Vanderbilt, MD Anderson, etc. CPP is an amazing school that feels strangely homely which is never something I thought I\u2019d say about a school. Without a doubt, go to CPP!",

Additionally, being a Polytechnic, all of the labs are very hands on and there's plenty of opportunities to get actual experience using equipment and technology, unlike other schools that might just have videos on how to use the same equipment. Additionally, pomona is a relatively small school, especially compared to your other options, which means you'll have more of a chance to get to know your classmates and professors, and give you more of an opportunity to get involved with research if that's a path you want to go down. Pomona has limited grad students, which also means that most of their focus (and funding) is on undergrad. \n\nI'm not super knowledgeable about environmental science, but I do know that we have a big area devoted to regenerative studies, and they practice what they preach. \n\nCons: general school bs such as perpetually feeling underfunded, not enough parking, expensive parking, and hit and miss professors and administrators (varying by department). Worth noting that our president has been caught up in a string of scandals recently involving vast amounts of money being relocated illegally. The area is not great and there's not a lot to do within walking distance of campus, but the campus takes security very seriously and most of the violence the campus experiences seems to be isolated incidents that are very targeted, as opposed to large incidents where anyone nearby might be in danger. \n\nBest of luck to you and I hope this helps!! Def consider it, I was super happy with my decision even after dealing with covid partway through.",

If you have your heart set on a field of study I\u2019d look into the faculty in your field of interest and figure out which one would better support you and your educational goals. UCR is a research institute and has LOTS of opportunities to do research. UCR has more of a social life than CPP (from what I can tell) and distance wise, CPP is probably closer if you\u2019re planning on commuting. If you\u2019re looking for small class size and that almost personalized attention and time, UCR is not it. Even in upper divisions I was 1 of 40 in my smallest lecture and professors can be a bit indifferent. Economically speaking I believe CPP might be on the more affordable side of things. \n\nGood luck!",

The professors are really shit, it could be just my luck or preference but I\u2019ve had more shitty professors than good ones, but the good ones have been amazing. Just take Rate My Professor with a grain of salt and you\u2019ll be fine. As far as internships goes that\u2019s gonna be dependent on much effort you put to go to career fairs and pay attention to emails about stuff, but they\u2019ve got good opportunities for you.",

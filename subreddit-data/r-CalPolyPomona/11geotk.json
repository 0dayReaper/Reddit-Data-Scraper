For a couple of hours he had a captive audience ranging into the hundreds.

Mars Hill apparently had something like a speakers mound there and any and all could come and say their piece.  \n\nThe Athenians liked to stand around and see if anyone said anything new or interesting.  Essentially they were there for the entertainment.\n\nThe situation today was much the same, just with outdoor plumbing and smartphones.  The one key difference was that St. Paul was savvy enough to realize that he was being humored by people who weren't really interested and left.  This guy, on the other hand, was getting exactly what he was looking for, so he'll be here all day... remember to tip your waiters.",

He wins when we give him attention. I mentioned this briefly when I spoke, but I grew up in this culture for way too many years. There is no changing his mind. The way pastors like this get funding and money is by showing that they have an audience. The very act of stopping and listening to his hateful, bigoted speech gives him power. Because here is the thing, I absolutely support his right to speak. I don't believe the answer is silencing voices we don't agree with but I also don't think the answer is entertaining them. My response in that moment was to speak over him until I got too emotional to continue. I wish I had continued speaking over him rather than at him. It wasn't a perfect response, but hey, I'm still figuring this out. But I do know listening for me isn't an option anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso - come to the library instead.

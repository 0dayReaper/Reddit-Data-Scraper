Very \"gets to class and get the lecture over with and crack a joke once a month\" vibe. He doesn't use much technology and asks for assignments to be turned in on paper, handwritten or printed digital writing. Kim has a well structured class, but I only was in her class for one lecture. Kim and Perez both used iPads and allowed digital submission.",

I like it though. Made friends to study with at the library in the in-between-classes time.",

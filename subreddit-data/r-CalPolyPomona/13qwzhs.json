I can\u2019t remember how long it took exactly but it takes them a while to get everything uploaded and organized on the site. When I graduated, the company was [gradimages](https://gradimages.com). I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s still the same but I would assume so. You can try taking a look at the site and seeing if your photos are up. I would probably give it some more time though because I looked up a friend who just graduated and his photos aren\u2019t up yet.",

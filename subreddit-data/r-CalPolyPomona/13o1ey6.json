My friends at ECE says ECE has to many students, no classes, and bad professors.  The ones that are teaching are not even full-time teachers! Can you believe that? And the part-time teachers also teach at bad times that is inconvenient to students! And they dont want to teach more classes in a semester.  With the money they make, you would of think that they want to teach more! Freaking unbeleiveable!",

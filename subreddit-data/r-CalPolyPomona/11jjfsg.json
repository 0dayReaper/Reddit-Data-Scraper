I applied to both CSUs and UCs, and I recently got into CPP. \n\nI'm interested in heading into the human factors design industry (probably aviation/aerospace, not really tech xp) or doing UX research. I heard that the program is very human-centered, so I kind of just want more insight on the ins and outs of the department as a whole. Thanks \\^\\^ ",

I will say that there are not many \u201clearn by doing\u201d opportunities compared to other majors or \u201cfield trips/studying abroad\u201d either. Curriculum is good, but it is also difficult for registration with the good professors, but definitely do-able if you pay attention.",

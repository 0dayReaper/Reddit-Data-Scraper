    "postText": "Hi all I am a high school senior and Just got accepted for industrial engineering and am wondering what the program is like. I have not done any deep research but applied to cpp because it was one of the few colleges in cali with industrial. \n\nThe main thing I care about is experiential learning like internships and co-ops and of course solid courses with teachers who care. \n\nIf any current  students or graduates could comment on this it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hi there, I\u2019m a 2nd year IE student and I\u2019m currently taking a semester off because I\u2019m working a full time Co-Op from Spring to Summer. I would absolutely recommend industrial engineering to anyone. One of the biggest things, like you mentioned, is that there aren\u2019t that many schools in California or in the US that teach industrial engineering (main ones around here are CPSLO and UC Berkeley which are central and Northern California respectively). On the other hand, if any school has an engineering program you can bet they have mechanical, civil, and electrical. In terms of job prospects, you\u2019ve got a really high chance of landing a job in a defense company in SoCal because there\u2019s little competition (many people from out of the country, where most IE schools exist, aren\u2019t able to work defense jobs due to clearance issues). Also the professors in our major really know their stuff, they are the smartest people I know. From my personal experience, everyone in the major is friendly and supportive because there\u2019s not that many of us (3rd or 4th smallest engineering major https://www.cpp.edu/data/dashboards/fall-term-characteristics.shtml) and also there\u2019s really no need to be cutthroat to succeed (like I didn\u2019t even give a 2nd thought about how this info would impact my job prospects by giving advice to newbies). It\u2019s a great major, the only thing is sometimes the subject matter gets boring or feels like \u201ccommon sense\u201d except you have to make numbers to back up your arguments of why things should be such a way. You\u2019ll sometimes be bullied for being an \u201cimaginary\u201d engineer, but honestly that\u2019s only ever happened to me once and it was from a civil engineer. Also, a big fear I had was the type of jobs I would be working. I imagined looking at machines and making schematics all day long to rearrange factories, but the work is a lot less technical and a lot more personal. Out of all the engineering types, we specialize in integration and systems development so we work with everyone to make sure they have a standard way of doing things, the most efficient process, ensure worker health/safety, etc. You can always work jobs in business, I\u2019m working as a production planner right now and hoping to move into supply chain management later. The vice president of customer affairs at USPS is an industrial engineer from Cal Poly Pomona. The examples go on. I would say that you should avoid the idea that you\u2019ll be working specifically manufacturing/industrial engineering jobs because mechanical and aerospace can often do what we do (and even better I would say) because they have a lot more resources and sub paths for their majors. But on the flip side, we can dive into business careers while still having access to the previously mentioned jobs. I was literally hired off the bat after the supervisor saw \u201cworkflow diagrams\u201d and \u201cprocess improvement\u201d because that\u2019s the stuff upper management has to do and it\u2019s great if any of their staff or interns can lend a hand by sharing ideas or even creating project documentations. The coursework was very easy imo, you just need to put in the work. My dad does process control and he recommended me the major because at every job there seemed to be a shortage of IE to fill a position. At my workplace, the engineering folk really approved of my major after I told them. I would recommend researching more using sites like BLS (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/industrial-engineers.htm) and watching videos to see if it\u2019s really for you. I don\u2019t know everything about the major and I might just be very lucky with my experiences, so just be patient and careful with what you choose to pursue and don\u2019t take every word from this comment to heart. If you do decide to go forward with industrial engineering, lmk if you need any assistance, I\u2019m happy to help.",

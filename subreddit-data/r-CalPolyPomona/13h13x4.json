This happened to someone I know and it was fixed for them. \n\nIf yes,  screenshot it and send that to the email they give you.  They had problems last weekend too. But this way you'll have legitimate evidence that missing the deadline was on them. They'll get back to you and it'll be OK",

They got a call back and they said they're out of in person appointments and are schedule zoom appointments. \nSo leave a message with your number and they'll probably call you.",

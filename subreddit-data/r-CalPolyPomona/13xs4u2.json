    "postText": "Hey yall!\n\nI'm an incoming transfer student whose studying Computer Science here. Since my college didn't have articulation with CPP, I have to take my CS classes from scratch (I have AS in Engineering and AS-T in Math). \n\nAssuming I got credit for CS1300 (Discrete Math), could I take CS1400 and CS2400 together?\n\nThe CS2400 prereqs are:  *C or better in CS 141 or* [*CS 1400*](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;print#tt2113)*; CS 130 or* [*CS 1300*](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;print#tt7238)*; and MAT 114, MAT 115, MAT 116, MAT 214, MAT 215, MAT 216,* [*MAT 1140*](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;print#tt8074)*,* [*MAT 1150*](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;print#tt8728)\u00a0*or* [*MAT 2140*](https://catalog.cpp.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=61&amp;poid=15916&amp;print#tt8183)*.* \n\nThoughts? Could I get an exemption from my advisor during orientation? Thank you!",

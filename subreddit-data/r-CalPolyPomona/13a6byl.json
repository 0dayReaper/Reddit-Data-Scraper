I\u2019m shocked the school doesn\u2019t host the graduation at  arena or stadium, like CSUSB does at the Toyota Arena in Ontario. I\u2019m expecting complete chaos!!!!!",

CPP instead does many small ceremonies by college which is 100x nicer, faster, you\u2019re sitting next to classmates, the graduation speaker is relevant to you\u2019re studying, etc. parking can suck, but it\u2019s way more organized and faster than any other institution\u2019s graduation I\u2019ve been to as a student or faculty member.",

With ceremonies being back to back and then everyone leaving after the last one of the day, you can get stuck in the lot for a while. I\u2019d recommend arriving early and leaving either early or late to avoid the traffic as much as possible",

            "comment": "It's done per college, the larger ones then break it down by department.  There's no specific marching order, so when its your turn to go on the stage you have to scan your ticket again and let them know how you pronounce your name (more about that below lol)\n\nAnyways, my experience was weird, it was chaotic on a personal level. When I walked last year it was the first time post-covid that I was around huge crowds after being locked up at home, so it was pretty nerve-wracking.\n\nMy ceremony was on a Saturday afternoon, I thought I left home early with 90 minutes in hand, but I  suddenly hit traffic and barely made it with 15 minutes left before the ceremony started.\n\nTo make matters worse, I didn't fit and secure my regalia on before the ceremony so I was fumbling with it in the parking lot. Huge mistake because I looked sloppy, my sashes and stole kept on falling off during the ceremony, lost my tassel by the end of it.\n\nI ended up reusing my HS grad robe because it was the same color, not sure if the official ones had the same number of pockets, but I almost misplaced my ticket the second time they asked for it lmao. I was then caught off guard when they asked how my name sounds, but thankfully they heard it correctly.\n\nHave to admit I wasn't in the best mood either that day because I regretted inviting my family and having to deal with their negativity. They always downplay and disregard accomplishments, graduating was a big deal for me as someone with learning disabilities (I almost didn't make it). Besides that, the gloom of being unemployed and having no immediate prospects dawned on me (and my family members) as well smh.\n\nThat was long, but I hope you got the point lol. Just be prepared before you go. Congrats to you and everyone else graduating this year!",

It\u2019s well organized and I hope the school never changes it. As far as tips, just get to the school 30-45 mins early and direct your family to the quad. Congrats on graduating.",

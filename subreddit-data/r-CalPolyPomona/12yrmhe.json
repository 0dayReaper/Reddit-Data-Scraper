You should be able to see a clothes rack and mannequin outside their door. Just walk in and ask if you can check out some clothes :) they might still ask you to swap for them but you can just ask them to hold onto the items you want to keep, and bring them clothes the next day. The person I talked to was kind enough to just let me take them without swapping. (Mostly cuz they had wayyyyy too much to hold onto lol)\n\nI\u2019ll also link their Instagram below. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cppwrc/?hl=en\n\nEdit: theres only a few weeks left before this program is over. So try to grab some before it ends! They plan to make this a permanent event throughout the whole year, but it\u2019s not certain.",

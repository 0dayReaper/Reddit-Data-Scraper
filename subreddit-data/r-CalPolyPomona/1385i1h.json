I don\u2019t think this is one of those cases tho, just because it looks like its from the school itself. And CPP is pretty generous with giving away freebies without donating. \n\nThe tag also names a professor and their course. Maybe it\u2019s part of the recent book drive on campus?\n\nEdit: thanks for warning me tho. I\u2019m kind of a sucker to stuff like that and need reminding sometimes :/",

    "postText": "I know this has probably already been asked a ton, but I wanted to ask I\u2019m the context of CPP and the area around here. For current aerospace students or graduates, how is the internship search and job outlooks after graduating? (I know networking is a part of it). \n\nAlso I\u2019ve read everyone that usually people recommend MechE and then go into the aerospace industry, since MechE leaves more job opportunities. Should this be something I\u2019m concerned about going into aerospace, that if I major in AE I might struggle to get a job?",

I remember people talking about how other schools had already shut down and gone fully virtual and that it sucked that we still had to be there in person.\n\nProfessors started warning us that it was in the talks but they weren't sure yet. Then abruptly after my last class of the day, we got the email and people on campus were spreading the news and celebrating lol \n\nWe were pretty happy and excited about it at the time. Sleep in. No more driving. No more coming to campus and looking for parking. But I don't think we realized that was going to be our last day on campus as a students for a lot of us, and last time seeing friends and professors in person. \n\nI remember cheering with a friend on campus that we could stay at home, saying good bye, then never seeing each other irl ever again lol",

I am not an expert at the university budget, but I do know that there was a lot of concern about not having enough money to cover expenses, especially if a lot of students stopped enrolling during the pandemic and the economy cratered (the university gets around half of its funding from student tuition, and around half from the state).\n\nThere were even rumors about faculty and staff maybe having to take a temporary pay cut to help balance the budget, but instead we received no pay increase.\n\nSo, maybe a temporary tuition reduction could've been implemented if the administration knew for sure the economy wouldn't crater and enrollment would remain strong. But there was so much uncertainty before the vaccines came out in March 2021.",

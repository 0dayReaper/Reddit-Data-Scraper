I am open to randomly dorming with someone but I think it might to be good to find someone with similar interests. Anyone have ideas what I should do? Trying to figure this out before the housing group deadline of May 19th, thanks for the help in advance",

If you aren\u2019t featured on it, you should definitely get yourself featured so people can get to know you. Pretty much everyone put that they\u2019re looking for friends in their bio. A lot of people also are eager to find roommates. The people not looking for roommates for the most part are the local students.",

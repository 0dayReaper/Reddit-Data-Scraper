If you feel like the commute is too much of a burden towards the end of the semester, then I would consider housing. Just make sure to apply for housing ahead of time if you're actually thinking about staying on campus.",

            "comment": "I live around the same mileage as you (32ish) and it takes me 40 mins (without traffic) to commute. I honestly prefer that over dorming here again. I dormed my first year and it\u2019s not worth the $15k i had to pay. I\u2019ve also been saving a lot of money on gas. I\u2019m probably paying somewhere between $800-$900 on gas for 16 weeks which is a lot cheaper than 7k-8k for 16 weeks living on campus. \nI agree with the other comment that said to commute for one semester and then see if you want to live closer. If you, i highly suggest off campus where it could potentially be cheaper.\n\nEdit: and honestly, it\u2019s not that bad commuting once you get used to it \ud83d\ude05 and you can work your schedule to just come 2 days a week and save more on gas that way too! I unfortunately have to come 4 days a week so it\u2019s more gas for me. The $800-$900 is a bit exaggerate but with gas prices these days, it\u2019s somewhat close.",

The commute for me is worth not paying the outrageous housing fee's (takes me about 30-35 minutes on average for me to get to CPP with no traffic) but I understand why people go for housing regardless. \n\nI've pretty much gotten used to the commute here just like you did, so I never decided to go for housing. But I have thought about housing before just like OP did.",

            "comment": "Living on campus isn't too bad if you can afford the rent. The University Village which is across the street from the school is about $1000 in rent for your own room, but you share the apartment with 3 other people. I think it goes down to about $800 if you get a phase 2 or 1 which requires you to share your room with someone. Rent isn't too bad if you consider other places nearby\nPros:\n-Utilities included in rent\n-Laundry machines are free (and they have like 20 washers and 20 dryers, they have plenty but still get filled)\n-Get $35 meal points per month\n-Cleaning of kitchen and restroom by a hired service\n-We also recently got a security service to drive around since we had a couple of window smashing last semester\n-Community, we have a discord. You can do trades and sell unwanted items, get questions answered (admin is very active), meet new people, we have a community garden and events for holidays and fun.\n-Fixing crew, if you have a broken light in your apartment or if anything else is broken (it must be a part of the apartment) you can put in a work order, in my experience, they actually come pretty quickly\n-Some furniture is provided, bed frame, mattress, desk, chair, shelf, drawers, sofa, tables, chairs, electric multi-outlet plug\nCons: \n-PARKING, you must buy a permit that lets you park 7 days a week on campus. There is enough parking but you might have to park a bit far from your building\n-Rules, no pets, kitchen appliances must be kept in kitchen not in your rooms (except mini fridge), we get inspections once a semester where they can come into your room, but they do let you know when it'll happen\n-Roommates, try your best to find friends and apply together, but for the most part it really is a gamble, most people are chill but you never know who you'll get as a roommate\n-Apartment is not the best quality, there is some chipped painting, browning, stains etc. a little sore to the eyes but not a big deal to me",

I have \"in-person\" classes that are slowly drifting to online now that the semester is going along. Live in a area you want to and go to school around that",

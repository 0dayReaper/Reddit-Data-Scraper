Like medical services, gym membership, maker studio etc. I spent 4 years not using any of these and regret it very much\u2026 Tuition is expensive so take advantage of all the free resources while you can)",

The reusable cloth bags look really nice too. \n\nThe only really college mech I still have are two pins, a Jansport Sweater, another sweater, two tshirts, two sweat pants, two shorts, three lanyards and a small cloth bag. Most of these items are stuff I brought from the bronco bookstore.",

    "postText": "I didn't think I would be able to go to the graduation ceremony. I had applied for it, rsvped, and even have tickets. Because I didn't think I was going to be able to graduate or attend, I didn't bother buying the cap and gown. Long story short- I CAN attend. I'll might be able to borrow a black cap and gown from a friend but I don't know about the 2023 tassel and cal poly pomona green sash. Can I still walk without those? Or do they sell them at the bronco store? I'm not sure what I should do. If I can't walk, I can't walk. It's ok. I just want to know if there's a chance so I can at least try!",

I'm an architecture major and before I transferred here I \"adopted\" the architect, Antoine Predock, to study for an assignment in community college. I've been a fan of his work before I came to CPP so it was always surreal and cool to see the CLA every time I was on campus. I've been meaning to go grab a piece of the building before it's gone cause I'd definitely like something to remember it by.",

    "postText": "Good evening \n\nContext: \n\nI just finished my freshmen year at Cal Poly and have been adjusting to college life this far. With my high school friends going in separate path\u2019s, the need to push outside my comfort zone to make new relationships has been very prevalent but historically difficult personally. As a result, the first idea that comes to mind would be the participation of a club that suits my personal interest (that being outdoor activities but more specifically fishing).\n\n\nQuestion: \n\nAre there any prevalent outdoor clubs or communities outside of the ASCI. More specifically, are there any fishing clubs on campus? \n\n(I know Cal Poly SLO has one  but no Pomona)\n\n\nConclusion: \n\nThank you to the people who took the time to read the post and have a good day",

There is a large CPP discord and you could find a few homies who enjoy fishing. \n\nIf I was still around I\u2019d go with ya, I went fishing a few times when I was there",

    "postText": "Farewell Cal Poly Pomona. We may have had our differences when it came to dead social life and activities, administration hijinks, uncaring and disconnected professors, the lack of Coca Cola products on campus, but you\u2019ve been there for my other academic needs when I needed you. Your library has been my monastery and a place for good times with classmates. Your BRIC has been a place for me to take my stress away. Your CLA is now a pile of rubble underneath a glorified bus stop underneath a fault line that will kill us all in many years. You\u2019ve been through it with me, and I can\u2019t say that i would have finished my degree without you. \n\nGoodbye Billy, and thank you.\n\nHello loans.",

You have probably made more of an impression than you realize, but it's been a tough couple of years for us, too, and often our stress comes across as aloofness. Please know that your determination is what gives us hope. \n\nOh, and I feel ya about the lack of Coca Cola. Diet Pepsi sucks.\n\nGo kick ass and live with no regrets. :-)",

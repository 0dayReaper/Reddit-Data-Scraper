They wouldn\u2019t even hide the fact that they would be talking about you. \n\nJust one instance: E-board would specifically pick people who were \u201ccool/ not bad-looking\u201d in order for them to have a \u201cbetter\u201d fam. When they were called out for this, they would always say something along the lines of \u201cE-board put a lot of thought into this year\u2019s pairings.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure it has changed but that was the main reason I left. Im sure they\u2019re nice people now and I hope they\u2019ve grown. It was almost like high school all over again when I was in that club.",

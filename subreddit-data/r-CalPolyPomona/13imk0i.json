If you fail you already know the material and went out swinging ready for the next semester. Getting a WU is treated like getting an F towards your GPA. What\u2019s the point in coming all this way for the semester only to not take the final, especially on a chance that you MIGHT fail unless you work your ass off\u2026",

Remember this as well, a lot of people failed classes in college, it\u2019s not a big deal. Ur mental health should come first, but don\u2019t give up on yourself to easily. Study as much as you could and take the finals. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and you\u2019ll do better than you think.",

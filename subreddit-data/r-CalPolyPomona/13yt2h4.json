The person I spoke to told me that when they have extra funding at the end of the year, they redistribute it amongst eligible students. Then I checked my financial aid awards for this year (22-23) and it was there under \"State University Grant\".",

However, the financial aid office said that the system will update automatically and won\u2019t be sending me any financial aid for this summer so I\u2019m not really sure. I\u2019m gonna be contacting the office themselves but let me know if anyone happens to know anything.",

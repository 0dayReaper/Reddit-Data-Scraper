    "postText": "I applied to Cal Poly Pomona for CS and just got a decision saying I was waitlisted. I go to the portal to accept the waitlist offer but the portal says they're not accepting any students on waitlist anymore. Why would they offer me to get on the waitlist if they're not taking anyone? :/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: The portal updated and now shows the option to join the waitlist. I just needed to be patient and wait until the next morning \ud83d\ude05",

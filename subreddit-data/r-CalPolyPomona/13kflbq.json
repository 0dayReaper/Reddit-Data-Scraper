    "postText": "I am a transfer student (admitted for Fall, Animal Science-PreVet) who is stuck taking a really difficult Calculus class at CC this spring. It does not appear to be required for admission or even needed to take for the major, however I did put it on my application and Ive heard AS is very impacted.\n\nI know the general response of \"chances of admission rescinded due to dropping a non-required class is low but we can not guarantee anything\", but how common is it really? Has it happened to any of you or have you heard of it happening?\n\nI would just LOVE to drop this class if it is not necessary.",

I dropped the class in the spring and I attend cal poly in the fall. I did email and talk to my counselors at my old community college first to make sure it\u2019s fine. When they told me it\u2019s fine, I dropped it the same day. I think you should be able to drop the class and not be effected, but make sure to double check with a counselor. Also, make sure the drop period hasn\u2019t ended.",

So it shouldn\u2019t be an issue seeing that they\u2019re pretty much the same thing. If I remember correctly, by the time you report your last grades your pretty much locked in as student.",

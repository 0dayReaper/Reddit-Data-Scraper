In the meantime, go to the university catalog and or search cpp course curriculum for ur major and look at it. The sheet will say the major required required class and electives and and other requirements so u can start thinking about ur class. If u have GE left, I think u have 3 left for upperclassmen transfer, take one each semester.",

Will this give me a good idea of what professors and courses I will have to take when I register for classes on orientation day??",

Look at the classes u took at ur previous college and see which one can transfer over. From there, see how many classes u need to take. Look at each classes prerequisite, which is important because it unlocks other classes, so pay attention to that. Start making a plan and see how many units and how many classes u need to take. From there, look at the catalog to see if those classes are offered in Fall or Spring whichever semester u need. Then look at professors and schedule and see which one is the best and which one fits ur time schedule. Ask ur advisor for help and have them look at ur plan and ask them if it satisfies ur degree requirement completely.",

HOWEVER...that is not to say you can't reach out to pre-admission advising for \"general\" support. [https://www.cpp.edu/outreach/pre-admission-advising.shtml](https://www.cpp.edu/outreach/pre-admission-advising.shtml)\n\nMy advice is don't wait for them. Start figuring out what you need to graduate and plan your next few semesters around that. Things will change but at least you will have a clear understanding of what's required of you to get your degree. The website has most of the information you need to learn the process by doing it yourself.",

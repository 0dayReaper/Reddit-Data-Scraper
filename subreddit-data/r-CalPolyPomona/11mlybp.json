    "postText": "I\u2019m in the Montana suites and I\u2019ve had this persistent issue where whenever I go to bed, I\u2019ve been having trouble breathing. I\u2019ve tried sleeping with my head closer to the window and vice, I\u2019ve tried sleeping window open or closed, I\u2019ve washed my sheets countless amounts of times and it still happens no matter what. I was thinking it could be mold, but my boyfriend has a deathly allergy to mold and was just fine when hanging out here. I\u2019ve noticed it feels better when I take Benadryl, though that could just be the fact that it makes me drowsy.\n\nI go home on the weekends, and I sleep just fine at home. I was thinking maybe because of my boyfriend\u2019s cats getting fur onto his clothes then to my bed, but my boyfriend has also slept in my bed and I still sleep just fine there. So I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the room. Anyone else have similar experiences/tips they can offer?",

As someone who suffers from respiratory issues it's not fun to walk around as if an elephant is on your chest suffocating you 24/7 - I'd buy a mold test kit from Lowes or HD and send it in to get tested. It would be sad if 10 years down the line everyone who attended this school ended up with permanent lung damage.",

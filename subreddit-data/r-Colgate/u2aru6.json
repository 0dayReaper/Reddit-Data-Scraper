            "comment": "Totally different schools. Colgate is a small prestigious liberal arts college in a small rural town while GWU is a large medium-quality university in a large urban area. If you're interested in government, etc. maybe go with GWU? If you want a consistently good education, it's Colgate. If you need urban amusements a lot of the time (and not just on vacation or during your summers), it's GWU. If you want fewer distractions because you want to focus on academics and good friendships, probably Colgate. You're the only one who knows what you want. \n\nTo me, the quality of a Colgate education made the choice easy as I really didn't care that much if I was in a rural area or a city. I didn't know what programs I'd want to focus on, so there was no academic specialty attracting me to one school over another. And so on. Here's my thinking: If you go to Colgate, in a couple of years you'll realize how good an education you're getting and be glad you chose it. The rural small-town stuff isn't going to matter in the long run. If you go to GWU, an admittedly lower ranked school, you may always wonder if you got a great education and if you made the right choice. But if finances are the key, maybe you have to go to GWU. Or talk to the financial aid people at Colgate and explain your problem. Colgate promises to help every student who needs financial aid, so maybe you're in that group?\n\nIt's just that you're comparing two very different schools, so I wonder if you really know what you want in a college? Also the \"very rough winters\" thing makes me laugh. What you mean is that it snows. Who cares? Put on your coat, some gloves, and a scarf. I mean, really, suck it up. Or are you from California or Florida and scared of the cold? I knew some guys like that. They figured it out after awhile. No one dies from winter. And Washington DC also gets cold and snow. Plus it's one of the most humid places I'ver ever been (in the summer, at least). \n\nThe more I read your list, the more I think you want to be told to go to GWU because of the financial issues and because it's easier to travel to, has milder winters, people are \"cool\" (not sure what that means), and so on. In other words, GWU will be easier for you. So, chose easy or less easy. Your choice.",

    "postText": "**How to protect your self from Campus Safety**\n\n\n*If your a smoking pot in your room and it smells, there is a good chance Campo will be called. Your best chance of avoiding points is to leave the room as soon as possible. If you are not present it is very difficult for res life to assign you points, even if it is your room.\n\n**Campo Knocks: Room smells**\nIf you are in the room when Campo knocks, they can write you up for the smell alone. In this case do not show them any ganja or paraphernalia, say you were hanging out with some kids in your room who may have been smoking outside earlier. You can get out of the points as long as you don't admit to smoking yourself and you don't give them any weed. Campo may threaten to call the police to search the room- I have never herd of this happening unless the student has already given up a substantial amount of pot (over two ounces). Campo will say if you cooperate you will get in less trouble. This is not true. There have been times where I have be extremely co-operative(given up all my weed, bowls, papers,etc,) we even chatted afterwords about how weed will probably be legal soon and that they think its harmless) I still received 4 points. I have friends who have been very rude to them, argued ,disrespected them , and ridiculed their intelligence( I don't recommend doing this) but they still received 4 points. It really docent matter, If you give them your weed, you are getting 4 points.\n\n**Best place to Smoke at school.**\nIf you bought a vaporizer, don't use it in your dorm, they smell really bad when they heat up. Your best bet in your dorm (I don't recommend smoking in your dorm,still risky) is to smoke dabs, get an oil rig or a [G-Pen](http://www.grencoscience.com/), and exhale into a [Smoke Buddy](http://smokebuddy.com/), and have lots of smoke oder/ febreze eon hand ( never spray febreze in the room if you know campo is outside your door it is very suspicious).\n\nWhen it comes to joints and bowls, smoke outside in a place with a good view of all access points. Alway  bring a cigaret out with you. If you see someone coming whip out a cigaret. You can and deny any weed allegations. OF course i recommend taking a scenic hike to explore Colgate's Beautiful campus. The graveyard is awesome and so is the deep [Field of Dreams](http://imgur.com/ddsxkIz)/ cross country trails. \n\n\n**PREgaming?**\nThis is even more true for Alcohol, if you are in a freshman dorm having a pre game. When you hear a knock. Ask who it is. If its a CL or Campo, say \"please give me a second\". Before opening the door put away al alcohol and shot glasses. They CANT write you up unless they SEE Alcohol. Of course never admit to drinking, even if they smell alcohol on you, tell them you werner drinking. Most of the time they are not looking to writ kids up. They can view whats in plain sight so never agree to opining the fridge or drawers. When playing drinking games in your dorm, put a towel over the table- ping pong balls are loud and will get you in trouble.\n\n\nI hope this advice helps you from getting caught. My freshman year(this year) I have been caught 5 times, each time I have gotten out of it except once. Remember also if your roommate smokes too, you two can share the points. the first time make sure only one of you takes responsibility. Next time it the others' turn. The Associate Dean of Conduct, Kim Taylor, is an absolute  sweet treat, she is very reasonable and intelligent. Treat her with respect, she is on your side, and is there to help. Remember you came to Colgate to study, don't let weed negatively effect your grades or your social life- let it improve them, and take regular breaks.\n\n**TL;dr Never show campo your Ganja or Alcohol, always deny it**\n\n",

            "comment": "This year is my 30th reunion. I am stunned at the notion that campus security cares about weed or alcohol. When I was a freshman in 1980-81, we were not allowed to have kegs in the dorms. Campus security would walk past us smoking pot in the stairwells of Center Stillman to confiscate the keg from the fourth floor. Cans or bottles of beer, wine, and hard liquor were completely ignored.  \n\nAnd \"disciplinary points\"? What the hell are those?\n\nGod, I must be an old geezer.",

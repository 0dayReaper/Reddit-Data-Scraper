    "postText": "Hello, I am currently a senior in high school and I'm suffering through the college process. Colgate is on my list for colleges I'm applying to and it seems like a perfect school for me. I went and visited a couple months ago and thought it was great, however, I didn't get a chance to see what the students were really like. I was hoping some of you can help describe to me how the campus life is up there, specifically what type of students are found at Colgate.\n\nThanks for your time.",

            "comment": "Colgate student here. \n\nFirst off, let's get the obvious on the table: there is drinking.  It's there.  You will also probably encounter drug use (marijuana, what not).  This you will probably find at any college in America other than BYU.  If you're into that, it's there.  If not, there really isn't pressure.  I have plenty of friends who don't drink and have a jolly good time.  \n\nHamilton is a small town.  There is almost always something going on, but you might have to brach out a bit.  Ear to the ground and such.  \n\nAs expected from a school of Colgate's caliber, you will have quite a bit of work.  This, combined with pledging sophomore year can put a big strain on your personal time, but I've never known it to be a big problem.  \n\nOverall, the biggest piece of advice I can give is join up with groups.  Whether it be frats, Brothers, or just clubs, each group you join will open up new things to do, more people to see, and more ways to be super busy.  ",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the help. I expected drinking/drugs anywhere I go so that's not really an issue. It's nice to know a small town like Hamilton has a lot to do, I know Colgate is really focused around Hamilton because of how \"in the sticks\" it is, but I like that about the school. \n\nWith pledging, do most people join a frat? And honestly, if you can explain exactly what a fraternity is for and how it works that would be very helpful. Obviously I've heard of fraternities, but I have the stereotypical image of the jocky-douchey guys running the place with crazy initiations and huge parties. I wanted to know if that were accurate.\n\nNow I don't want to offend anybody with this: You said I should branch out a bit, does that imply that the people from Colgate are very flexible and outgoing when it comes to adventurous, dirty activities. I was raised in a mostly Jewish town from New York and everyone has an I'm-better-than-you sort of attitude about themselves that I'd like to escape. I want to meet people that don't mind getting down and dirty as opposed to missing out on kayaking because they can't ruin their Che'Nelle handbag. I want to be with people who are adventurous that like to camp and go hiking or are just open to new experiences in general. I want to get away from all the shallow people here and meet some interesting, quirky people. I wanted to know if I'm the right fit for Colgate if I'm looking for those type of people in my school. And if I'm not, I'm not trying to offend it's just not a place for me. I also hope you understand what I'm trying to say, it's hard to describe what I mean to someone who hasn't grown up in a town like mine.\n\nAgain, I thank you for response and I hope you can help me by just going into more detail about the students themselves.

                            "comment": "Alumnus here.\n\nMany people join a fraternity. It's about half of eligible students (sophomore year up) but it seems much higher than that because of the active and social nature of people in them.  As for the stereotypes, sure, there are douchebags in them, just like there are in everything else in life.  There are people who only have the activity of being involved in Greek Life, and there are people that do it in addition to other things.  As someone who came to Colgate never planning to go Greek, I'm happy that I did.  However, I think Greek life, especially for males, can be harmful to the campus, as so much of the social scene revolves around Greek events, and it's not likely that you'll go to them if you are not a brother.  As for pledging, you'll figure it out when you get here.\n\nAs for branching out, they probably mean that it's relatively easy to focus on simply doing your academics, maybe going Greek, and partying over the weekend.  But you want to make so much more out of your college experience.  Explore the neighboring towns, join clubs of things you think are neat, play a club sport, work at Colgate over the summer (I couldn't recommend that one enough).  As for the town that you describe growing up in, don't worry about having to explain it.  Colgate thrives on quirky people coming from wealthy families in well-to-do towns.  There are all types of people at Colgate; you're not going to get a homogeneous group.  People are generally smart and willing to engage in intelligent discussions at the right occasion, but you're hanging out with 699 other 18-year-olds who also just left home and went to college for the first time.\n\nI couldn't recommend Colgate enough. I wouldn't say they were the best years of my life, as that's a pretty sad thought that it's all downhill from graduation, but I never regretted going Early Decision there.  The people who tend not to like Colgate tend to not like college (no privacy, people busy all the time, work, homesickness). I'd recommend doing some sort of pre-orientation program.  I could not recommend Outdoor Education's Wilderness Adventure (WA) enough.\n\nSide note: Don't use the term \"suffering\" when describing the college search process.  It will be something that you will be looking back on and laughing about before too long.  If you are the caliber of student that is applying to Colgate, you'll be fine no matter where you end up.",

                            "comment": "As for pledging and fraternities, about 40% of my class pledged IIRC.  So it is a big presence, but also what gets overlooked is the fact that a majority choose not to pledge.   Again, it's there if you want it.  Those that do pledge do it for a number of reasons.  Some are just looking to go to more parties.  Others do it for the group atmosphere and to feel closer to a group of their peers.  Others do it to be part of something bigger.  I personally did not rush, simply because I don't have the time to commit and don't agree 100% with all of their practices.  That said, frats are an important part of the Colgate social scene.  Not only do they throw parties, they also hold fundraisers and other events and help raise awareness about a variety of issues on campus.  As I said, I did not choose to join a frat, but I have worked with them to plan a variety of events to great success. \n\nAs for the \"join a group\" thing, what I was trying to get at is that the social scene at Colgate is very group based.  You go to certain parties and events based on what groups you're in, and it's a very easy way to meet people who share your interests.  In addition, probably my favorite part is that joining groups, especially smaller groups, allow you to gain leadership experience.  I have learned more about event planning and management through my time at Colgate than in the rest of my life combined.  One of the groups I was most interested in during my freshman year was small and hungry for new ideas for group activities.  This meant that when I had an idea, they threw their funding behind me and let me take control.  I learned a lot, had a great time, and was voted in as a club officer the next year. \n\nWhen it comes to the people here, it is easy to write off the school as a group of white, airhead rich kids.  Believe me, as a middle class minority, it was my first thought.  However, once you meet some people (it doesn't take long, in freshman year I met 100 new people a week), get to know them, and find people you connect with, all that goes on the backburner.  The people here are much more complex than their outward appearance and behavior might suggest, and one thing I have learned is it is worth giving people 1,2, even 3 chances to surprise you with their depth and personality.  No one gets into Colgate without a reason. Trick is finding what that reason was.  ",

But there are plenty of other people who are way into the outdoors, as well as many other interests. The biggest advice I can give you on the college application process is that most schools are going to be fairly similar, but that your experience of the school can change drastically based upon how much you let yourself experience the school fully. I know people who convinced themselves going into freshman year that they would hate their school, and it came true. So just join a bunch of stuff, and try to unrepentantly meet as many people as possible in your first few months. ",

We also have Donovan's Pub, which is a little down the hill (by the lake). It is only open Wed-Sat, and it basically serves pub food. Overall, the food isn't great, but it ain't terrible either. There is this food company, Good Uncle (not thru Colgate) that delivers their own food (not like DoorDash or GrubHub). The food they have is usually OK.",

Other nights are traditionally party nights, but there are lots of people not partaking too. Well balanced people- friendly well balanced school",

I don't like beer, so I didn't drink it, but I looked sociable. A lot of Colgate students go to parties, and a lot do not. Studying and just generally working hard are very important at Colgate, but that seems to mean that many students need to blow off steam, as well. Some do that with sports or exercise, some just chill out alone or with friends, and some party. I was never bothered by partying when I was there. It was mostly in some fraternities but didn't affect me. I even sometimes studied on Friday and Saturday nights in the Library with many other students, so that's also possible. \n\nMy daughter also went to Colgate, much more recently obviously. I think she partied too much from what I can tell. But she got a great education, made some very good friends, and now words in a start-up company in San Francisco where she is doing very well. Whatever partying she did, it didn't seem to hurt her much. \n\nAs for someone who does not drink and does not want to be sexually casual with anyone, I think that would be entirely your own business. As students mature, they come to realize that you need to leave people alone to be who they want to be. That means freshman may be immature but with each year they grow up more. My point is I wouldn't worry too much about alcohol, drugs, or sexual behavior at Colgate. For one thing, these are problems at nearly all colleges and universities, and for another, Colgate students are generally pretty mature, very hard working, and have a high degree of common sense.\n\nGood luck with your college search.",

She also loves to dance, watch Netflix and cook at Pinchin lol. I am not going to deny how some kids are destructive when impaired because I have seen holes and broken stuff in the dorms.",

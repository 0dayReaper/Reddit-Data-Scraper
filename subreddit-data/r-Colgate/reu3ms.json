The last time I talked to them after graduation  they said the experience could\u2019ve been better but they were content. Colgate has the same problems as other white-dominated elite schools. Improving diversity is part of the school\u2019s 3rd century plan so I\u2019m hopeful that Colgate will lead the pack in ensuring that minority students feel included in academic, extracurricular, and social activities.",

            "comment": "It's a small, rural, mostly white school -- like dozens and dozens of other colleges in the U.S. You can't very well expect schools like that to be \"international\" or urban or anything like that. If you want an urban school filled with foreign students, pick the University of Southern California in LA or NYU in New York or a similar school. What you are trying to do is find a small liberal arts college in a mainly white country that also has lots of international students who are black? I don't think that animal exists. \n\nBut . . . if you're aware of this and Colgate appeals to you, and maybe it should, then you would be going in with your eyes wide open. Colgate has made great strides since I was there a very long time ago in enrolling minority students and foreign students -- and not just as athletes, either. In fact, it's dramatically different from when I was there. And it's an excellent top university that is also small enough to find your place and get to know people well. The professors are very good, the campus is drop-dead gorgeous (I kid you not), and the education you will get -- does that matter? -- will be first-rate. If you can put up with being a minority with the problems that come with that, you will do well. But finding a smooth  fit in these kinds of schools in the U.S. is not getting to be easy, I'm afraid. \n\nGood luck.",

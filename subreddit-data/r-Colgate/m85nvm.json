ED2 gets less applicants but they tend to be just as qualified as those in the first round. For Colgate, I would have to guess that because there was over a 100% increase in applications in the past year, that RD will admit the\nMost students, but that is only because it has the largest pool of applicants of all three rounds. The short answer is that it is fairly proportionate among the first two rounds, one will not be better than the other.  \n\nHope this helps.",

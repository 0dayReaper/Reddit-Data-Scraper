Also the weather can be extremely cold, and especially that it's in the middle of nowhere. However, I am interested in its CS/Math major and the campus is stunning. So I'm still on the fence about it.",

I had no idea what to study until a couple of semesters later and the CS professors were what made me choose. You take the professor not the class. The small classroom size in the  computer science and math department did it for me. Super personalized classes, hanging out in the lounge and literally chatting about anything with professors, drinking coffee, trolling them with difficult questions. It was fun.\n\nAnyways, the 3-2 program is not for CS majors, you would have to do physics I believe. So you might be able to do electrical/mechanical engineering. But send them an email and ask to get an official answer. It could be that you do physics at Colgate and finish up CS at Columbia.",

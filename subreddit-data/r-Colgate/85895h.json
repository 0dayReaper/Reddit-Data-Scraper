                            "comment": "First of all, what /u/Sebu91 said is true. You don't declare until after your sophomore year, but of course it's nice to have a good idea of what you want to major in, so that you can pick the right pre-reqs.\n\n\nHaving said that, a double major like that is overkill, in my experience. I was a econ/comp sci double major, and my time and sanity would have been much better served if I had at most minored in Econ.\n\n\nIf anything, I'd highly suggest you do a major/minor combination. Pick one major and one minor at most. Remember, college is not just about academics. You need to have a life outside the M-F 8-7pm academic commitment. Make meaningful relationships, join a club or organization, do a project or hobby outside school. All of these would mean that you don't have as much time at academia as you'd like, so you need to be very conservative about what you want to major in. I've seen a lot of kids coming in wanting to double  or triple major, resulting in someone taking 4 or 5 challenging classes in a semester (as opposed to say 3 hard one easy, or 2-2). They invariably dropped a class.\n\nRemember, no one will care about how many majors you had when you've just graduated. They'll mostly care about your GPA. Five years down the line, it'd be tacky to include that GPA (unless you're applying to grad school), and your experience and skillset and other non-academic accomplishments will matter more. Of course that depends on whether you're going to the industry or staying in academia, but that's a discussion for another day.",

What you need here is a solid foundation in Math first and foremost, a bit of Econ and then pick up some CS fundamentals if possible. What you learn in an Econ major is usually removed from what you'd so in finance (modeling etc that is not usually covered in any class). Focus on the fundamentals, and outside class, read up on what's needed for a career, and towards the end of your first year or summer, start prepping for getting an internship in the field for your junior year. Network, do a day in the life, talk to alumni in the field etc.\n\nBasically, in no particular order, what you want to do is 1) Solid foundation in Math 2) Aim for getting a good internship in your junior year 3) Keep up your GPA, which implies you perhaps taking shortcuts/being conservative in your courseload 4) Enjoy college by getting into social clubs/activities, going out, making a solid group of friends 5) Network.",

Don't think about \"not getting an internship\" at this point; it's too early to consider failure scenarios now. Just go to school, make the right moves, network early (if you're really committed, start making inroads here by the end of your first year, eg via A day in the life program etc), and start prepping for those summer internships at the end of your sophomore year.",

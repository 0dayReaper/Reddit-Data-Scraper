            "comment": "It's an excellent program as are most (all?) science programs at Colgate, at least according to all my long ago science friends who went on to become MD's and biochem scientists. Not sure why I hung out with them since I'm a history, literature, art guy, but I did. This was decades ago, though, and I have no knowledge of Colgate academic programs more recently so I hope someone more recent will comment. My daughter graduated from Colgate fairly recently, but was a Poli Sci major. Some of her friends, I remember, were heavily into science and thought the programs were very good. New science buildings with continued expansion of them have helped in a   big way, I understand.",

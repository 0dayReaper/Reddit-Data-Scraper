How are professors, research opportunities, resources, etc.? Anything would be greatly appreciated. I know it\u2019s one of the less popular majors so I\u2019m not too hopeful lmao. Thanks in advance!",

My FSem teacher is a bio professor and she always is asking for students to help her with her studies about worms and stuff like that! Feel free to PM if you have any more questions!",

PM me with any specific questions, but in general I thought it was a great program. My teachers were overall strong with one or two exceptions, and a few were truly great (shoutout professor Hagos!). I was also able to help out with research starting my sophomore year, and it wasn\u2019t particularly hard to get the opportunity to do so.",

Honestly I wish I took more of the department\u2019s classes. PM if you have any questions.",

Before I got accepted I went to a prospective students event, and then dropped Gary Ross a quick email after which he responded to (he\u2019s the best). Can\u2019t say for sure whether that helped me but it certainly didn\u2019t hurt.",

            "comment": "You are not a shoo-in, but you have a good chance. Colgate accepts many good students, but like any good school it also turns many away, too, because there's not enough room. Of course, they accept more students than accept them, like most colleges. Students who apply to many colleges can only go to one of them. Of the entire applicant pool, it seems you'd have about a 1 in 4 chance of being admitted. But that pool includes many students with lower scores than you, so your odds are much better. Among students with scores good enough to be admitted, a lot of each decision hinges on what a student contributes beyond good grades. Are they an athlete? A musician? A foreign student? A racial or ethnic minority? That sort of thing. Good luck.",

    "postText": "I just asked my professor to write me a letter and she's gonna submit it within 4 days. I called Colgate and they said they don't accept anything after March 15. Are they actually that strict or do they accept them later too?\n\nAnyone who's been in the same situation?\n\nAlso these are my stats:\nHigh School UW - 3.8; W - 4.1\nCollege - 3.67/4 previous quarter; It will come up to 3.83 after this quarter ends\nSAT - 1300; Also waiting for my new scores which will be &gt;1420\nNo EC's in college. 2 good EC's in high school. I think my essay was good. It didn't have any specific details about Colgate but the general Why transfer part was good. \n\nI know the stats are bad but is there any chance I could get in?",

            "comment": "I'm confused. You're obviously a smart kid, so why didn't you know long ago what the transfer deadline was? You asked for a letter on the day it was due. That really makes no sense at all. \n\nWhat you might do (or have done) is to explain to your recommender that you've been so busy studying (blah blah blah) that you were not aware that recc letters needed to be submitted by such-and-such a date, and could they pleeeeease write at least a short letter and email it to the Admissions Office at Colgate immediately? If they are willing, be very sure you give them a very nice bottle of wine and some munchies. But don't expect them to do this as it's way beyond reasonable. If I were in this situation, that's what I'd do (but I would never have let myself screw up this way). If I were you I'd do what needed to be done, including visiting and/or phoning the person you need to write for you. Otherwise, you can only hope they will accept some late letters. \n\nAs for your grades, etc. they're fine, but A's and B's are pretty standard for what Colgate looks at from thousands of other students, and a lot may depend on what school you earned these grades at. A very tough school would make those grades look good, but a less difficult school would make them look a bit ordinary. If you had some hook like athletics or other skills or interesting background, that might help so you may not even stand out in that regard. Sometimes, you just have to hope for the best, kid. Good luck. \n\n",

I didn't set up a reminder for the deadline and I found out about 2 or 3 days before the deadline.\n\nSo my teacher said she's gonna upload the letter on Monday. And I know that the letter's gonna be pretty awesome.\n\nI don't have any hooks and the college is a community college. So, I guess the only thing is that I took some tough classes in my first quarter at college.",

            "comment": "This is a bit sad, isn't it? The problem I think is that you can't ever really predict which dorms are going to be good and which bad. I went to Colgate decades ago and was initially in Stillman but at that time, it was awful. And I had two unbelievably annoying roommates who only spoke basketball and never shut up about it. Plus they were slobs. Eventually I transferred to West Hall which was much better. Friends of mine had varying experiences, some liking their roommates and dorm-mates and finding them easy to deal with, some driven out of their minds by some people's rudeness. Kind of like the rest of society, I guess. \n\nThe problem always is the people in the dorms and you can't tell which dorm will be good and which bad with any reliability since people in dorms change every year. Had I been in some other dorm it might have been better, but it might have been worse. It depends on who lives there and what their values are. Dorms change from year to year. \n\nIf you find a dorm difficult to live in, go to the Housing Office as I did (assuming Colgate still has a housing office), and ask for a transfer. They've heard every story in the books and will want to accommodate you in some way. Rooms open up as people move around, for one thing. Or live off campus which I finally did for my last two years at Colgate. At least that way my friends and I had some control over our environment. With pre-meds and others there was a lot of studying going on. And when we wanted to enjoy ourselves, we didn't want to bother other people, so being off campus helped there, too. The problem always is about 10% of people who aren't mature enough and who genuinely lack common sense and awareness of other people. Dorm advisors and so on are supposed to monitor this sort of problem but generally that doesn't work well.\n\nI studied a lot like you, partly because I was a slow learner. I liked to reread things and so on to understand them better, so I took a lot of time. So I needed good places to study. Dorms were not places to study, I found, even the study areas which were never pleasant. The Library generally worked well enough, but I found a few favorite spots around campus that were better, quiet and open all night. I'm sure they're not there anymore as buildings have changed, but you might look for places you find comfortable like department libraries, classrooms, music rehearsal rooms (when not being used for music). It's worth some walks around campus to see what's available. Or invest in some sound-cancelling headphones or something. This is a problem at every college, or most anyway, and some are beyond awful. Colgate at least has a lot of smart people who do want to study -- along with some immature idiots. But there really should be more attention paid to the problem. How about writing an editorial for the newspaper about Colgate's failure to provide reliable, quiet, comfortable places to study and live? It's fine to consider everyone whose in college an \"adult,\" but frankly a lot of people aren't and some continue to behave like children. In an environment for learning that's a problem. \n\nGood luck. Study hard -- wherever you find a good spot.",

Neighbors partied all day and all night; screaming while I was trying to zoom to classes; slamming doors at all hours; rampant drugs and alcohol..and vandalism of the hallways and bathroom that we all had to pay for. Monitor did nothing about the noise and behavior. Campus cops turned a blind eye to the drugs. There\u2019s gotta be some place where more mature students live and show respect for others, right?!",

            "comment": "Little late on this but I had a great experience living on Andrews's 4th floor in my sophomore year. There aren't many people on the floor cuz it's all large suites, it's all sophomores so it's much less rowdy than a freshman floor, and the rooms are great. Could not recommend more, and with the possible exception of Pinchin and Burke which are also very nice I doubt there's a better option for sophomores. AFAIK Andrews's 2nd floor is also all sophomores and very similarly formatted. In any case just based on what I've heard you've got nowhere to go but up after Curtis.",

    "postText": "Hey guys I also got accepted to Colgate and it\u2019s by far my top choice I think, but I\u2019m still hesitant about a few things I\u2019ve heard and I would appreciate some input from u guys~ thanks in advance\n\n1.\t\u2060I\u2019ve heard Colgate has a lot of division I athletes and sports is a really big part of school. Although I do play varsity sport in high school, I\u2019m not planning on doing it seriously in college and would rather join more casual clubs. Will I fit in well if I\u2019m not on a sport team since i heard a lot ppl make friends thru that at \u2018Gate? Plus how\u2019s the ski club at Colgate(i heard there is one)? I\u2019m bad at skiing but I do enjoy it and I thought having a skiing club at school sounds pretty fun.\n2.\t\u2060On the practical side, In terms of job placement out of college, how many of those \u201cnice/top\u201d jobs were taken thru personal/family connections? I\u2019m defaulted to Econ major for now, though that may change in four years, but just looking at grad placement for Econ, I wonder how many of those decent jobs are reachable through hard work and maybe some effort in hustling and alumni networking vs. Dad/Mom tug me into that buyer fund or something like that? I just can\u2019t really tell thru the profile and it\u2019s something I constantly worry about LAC despite liking liberal arts education lol\n\nThank you for answering all the questions in the sub from admits. Colgate seems like a super nice place I never imagined myself to be in\ud83e\udd7a",

            "comment": "With regards to making friends, you can do that just about anywhere. You don't need to be on a team (or greek life for that matter) to meet new people. One of the things I do appreciate about Colgate is that it does a great job introducing you to people through your Freshman Seminar (FSEM). On top of that, if there are activities you like to do such as cooking, sports, video games, etc., the school sends out many emails about various opportunities on campus. As a senior, I'm still very good friends with many people who I met my freshman year, so definitely don't worry about it. There is a ski team and you don't have to be a good skier to join, I don't know about racing though.\n\nWith regards to jobs, it definitely depends. I will say that A LOT of people get financial jobs and in some cases, one of their parents is high up in the company. If you're struggling with finding a job, the new career center will gladly help you with resumes, cover letters, interviewing prep, etc. Additionally, with Colgate's large alumni network you're bound to meet someone or bump into someone who does what you wanna do. My advice would be to not focus too much on what others are doing and receiving, everything that happens was meant to happen so just make sure you're putting in the hard work/effort and you'll be fine. Hope this helps",

            "comment": "1. You can find friends really anywhere, clubs are a good way to start making friends, there\u2019s tons of clubs for people to join. I\u2019m not big into the D1 sports, but I\u2019ve made a lot of friends through clubs I\u2019ve joined, and from there you\u2019ll most likely meet your friend\u2019s friends and it\u2019ll all work out.\n\n2. I\u2019m a CS major so I sadly can\u2019t speak to much on Econ, but if you ever had any broader STEM questions about Colgate, just lmk.",

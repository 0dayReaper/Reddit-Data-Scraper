    "postText": "I was recently admitted into Colgate as a Transfer student, as a sophomore to be a junior, unsure how credits will line up whether I graduate in 2025 or 2026. However, I know all about the academics of the school, I am wondering how to get to know other students who are transfers and also just get to know the social atmosphere of Colgate well. I am interested in rushing, club sports, and volunteering opportunities.  Any info on how to connect with other transfers would be great and then a bit more about the social scene",

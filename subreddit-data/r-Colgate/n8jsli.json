    "postText": "I'm potentially moving to the area and was curious how loud things get on the outskirts of campus. If you are within a block of Broad St. between campus and downtown is there typically a lot of foot traffic and noise in the evenings? Or are the frat/sorority house parties pretty well contained?",

If you\u2019re even a house or two down you\u2019ll be more insulated from the noise but the foot traffic will still be heavy on the sidewalk. If you\u2019re a block away you\u2019ll probably be fine with noise but I would expect people walking on the sidewalk pretty often no matter where you live.",

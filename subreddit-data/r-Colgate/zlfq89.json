Treat the adults who you meet on campus, and in town with care. Introduce yourself. Make a personal connection, you will benefit. Also check out Wilderness Adventure, the pre-fresh trips.",

We have a big club fair in September and it\u2019s great. Most schools have them but we have so many things to get involved in. \nAnd follow their student activities association page on Instagram that constantly posts fun things to do. \n\nhttps://instagram.com/saacolgate?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nCongrats!",

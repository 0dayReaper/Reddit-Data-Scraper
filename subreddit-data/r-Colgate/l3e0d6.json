I doubt you'll hear from many international students this way, so your results are going to be meaningless -- unless you're just trying to get into contact with a few which is an entirely different situation, I suppose. You'll find accurate information either on the Colgate Admissions website which often lists how many of each category of applicant has been admitted -- or by calling the Admissions Office and asking them nicely. \n\nGood luck, and if you've been admitted, congratulations! Go 'Gate!",

            "comment": "Pen and paper work best, generally, and taking notes that way makes what you're learning (and writing) more memorable. There's a good deal of research to support that claim. Apparently when you physically write the words, draw the diagrams or time lines, and arrange them on the paper it reinforces the information in your brain far more than typing them into a computer in a standard list format. I was a history teacher for 46 years and that's what we discovered, anyway. It's also true that students who use laptops, etc. tend to just write down everything as if they were going to read it all later and edit it, but then they don't do that. Handwriting means you have to be more selective, writing down what's most important. More notes is almost never better notes. You want focused, shorter notes. Do whatever you want, of course, but I think you'll find writing by hand ends up working better. You can flip back and forth among the pages, add something earlier, underline easily, write in bigger letters if you want to emphasize something, draw quick diagrams, charts, and so on. Also when a computer crashes or fails to 'save' or some other technical disaster, it's really bad. Carrying an extra pen or two prevents any problem when you handwrite in a notebook. \n\nYears ago, I always used the standard spiral notebooks. Then before tests, I'd summarize all my notes from the past month or two onto one or two sheets of paper (these summaries I often typed). If you can't summarize it very simply, you don't understand it very well. I got to the point where I could summarize an entire semester's course onto no more than three (yes 3) sheets of paper and then go over it again and again and again -- rather than rereading a hundred pages of notes that I always forgot most of. Summaries of my notes made me a much better student who remembered all the main themes and all the key points about them plus some examples of each. You might try it. You want less, not more. \n\nAlso (sorry this is so long), most of the time you'll find that what the professor teaches is way more important than what the textbooks say. Read the books, of course, but only to get the main points out of them -- and maybe a few memorable details. The professor will ask about what he taught, what he lectured about, or what he had the class discuss far more often than asking about the books which are supposed to a kind of \"background\" for the lecture or discussion. Far too many students devote far too much time to reading every textbook line by line, taking detailed reading notes, and find it bears little relation to tests or exams which are nearly always about the main themes the professor emphasized, not the books. Ideally, you'd read the readings very quickly -- maybe in one afternoon or two or three days for an entire book -- to get its main arguments. Jot those down without wasting time going through everything the book says laboriously. Read entire chapters for their main ideas, not all the details, then write down that one main idea with a few examples -- nothing more. Often the title of the chapter or the first paragraph (or the final paragraph) tell you what that main idea is, then read all the rest quickly. People who \"highlight\" their books page after page always overdo it (and have nervous breakdowns). It's mostly a waste of time to read that way. \n\nLearning Tips! No charge!\n\nGo, Gate! Amazing place, by the way.",

So, even if your classes can be taken online, I\u2019d suggest still coming to campus just because it\u2019s such a central part of the Colgate experience to live there. I know things will be a little more lowkey this semester to control the virus, but I think it\u2019d still be worth it to be on campus, especially with it being your first year there.",

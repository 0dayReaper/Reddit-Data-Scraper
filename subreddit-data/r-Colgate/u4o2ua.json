    "postText": "So it was around 1995 when Colgate 13 performed in my HS. I was immediately hooked and bought the CD the group was selling. Amongst the songs they performed and were on the album were Africa (Toto) and Is she really going out with him (Joe Jackson).\n\nI have moved many times since then and have lost that CD. I'm getting nostalgic in my middle age and I'd love to get a copy of that album again. I tried to email the contact listed on the Colgate 13 website to see how I can purchase it again but no one ever got back to me. \n\nSo I'm here begging to see if anyone has a copy of that CD and would be willing to convert to MP3 and share with me. Thanks a ton in advance.",

Modern-day kids call them \"vinyl\" which is weird) of Colgate 13 music, and one of my best friends at Colgate was in the group. It's kind of dopey, old-fashioned music, but the harmony is what sells it. It's very nice to listen to.",

            "comment": "Recent (2021) graduate here (and asian-american)! \n\n1. The asian population at colgate is really really small. Coming from a hs where all my friends and classmates were asian was a huge change. That being said, there are a lot of really great asian communities on campus (student associations and dance groups) that provided a space for me to connect with other asian students on campus. The international student population is also very close (they usually have their own orientation) and it's pretty easy to befriend them by joining some of the student orgs they are in. Joining these groups really makes the asian population on campus seem a lot bigger than it is.\n\n2. The party scene at colgate is pretty big (you can really feel it on Fri &amp; Sat nights). But with freshmen it's primarily centered around the jug (a place in town) and for upperclassmen greek life. This doesn't mean that Colgate students don't care about academics though. Most students are studying on sundays (libraries are jammed packed) and throughout the week. I didn't really drink the first two years at Colgate but still found niches of people (in clubs and student orgs) where I either felt comfortable drinking or participating in non-drinking \"bonding\" activities. However, it is easy to just stay in your room so make sure to get out there and find a group of people you really connect with! You don't have to necessarily be proactive in joining every org but if there are certain things you really enjoy, join the club that Colgate has for it! Colgate also has a HUGE endowment and they do put a lot of it in student organizations to go on trips or to buy things to make their students happy.  \n\n3. I really hated the rural (and cold) area for my first year. I hated not having access to asian food especially lol. But over the years I really got to like the upstate NY area and being outdoors. Having a friend group that you can actively do things with and go to events with is also great. While some of the events that CLSI (student org office) or CAB (activities board) or even your commons (residential group) run may seem a bit cringe, they are fun to go to with a group of friends/people you live near. Joining student orgs is also a good way to go on trips! COVID has really limited the ability for travel but clubs like the ski club go on trips to local ski resorts. OE (outdoor education) makes regular trips to the Adirondacks. Speaking union clubs (debate, MUN, mock trial) also travel domestically and internationally to tournaments. There's also a bus that (during non covid times) regularly went to a giant mall in syracuse.\n\n4. Small class sizes are great! I always had large classes in hs and being in smaller class environments really let me get to know professors via office hours/after class discussions - there's also a lot of research opportunities if the professors really like you. Even if you go into Colgate thinking of taking a certain set of classes, always try and take classes in other departments. One of my biggest regrets is trying to finish my major as fast as possible. It gets really boring seeing the same students and faculty in every one of your classes (especially with small class sizes). Other departments have some really cool professors who might spark your interest in another major/minor. It's really easy to qualify for minors in other departments so use your core class requirements or extra electives to diversify!\n\n\n\nOne thing that's also really attractive about Colgate is their financial aid packages. I believe they just upgraded the amount of financial aid certain students get but almost half of the student body is on some form of financial aid and the awards they give are pretty generous. This in combination with the large endowment really allows for a lot of students to get a lot of opportunities they wouldn't have at a large school.",

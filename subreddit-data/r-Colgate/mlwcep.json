    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a graduate student working on my Master\u2019s project. My teammates and I have designed a sound-based virtual coworking platform and we're looking to evaluate it with undergrads and graduate students who have experience visiting public spaces with others around (libraries, coffee shops, etc.) to study or do their work.\n\nIf you're interested in volunteering, you will participate in a two-part research study. The two sessions will take place on separate days, and each session will last up to 1.5 hours max. You will be asked to complete three different tasks while using the virtual coworking space and a comparable system. With your permission, we will also ask you to take a screen recording and screenshots while using our system for a small portion of the session. At the end, you will answer questions about your experience with using our system.\n\nWe expect to enroll up to 20 participants for this study. Participants will be compensated $15 for the first session and $20 for the second session, totaling $35 for the entire study. Compensation will be provided in the form of an Amazon gift card. If you or someone you know is interested in participating in this research project, please complete this 3-minute eligibility survey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi)\n\nPosting here because I thought some folks may be interested in earning an Amazon gift card while helping fellow students with a project. We're trying to get feedback from students from many different regions (not just around our school) so that our data is representative of students across the country.",

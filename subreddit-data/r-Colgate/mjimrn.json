One intro chem prof may be a total pushover while the other has 3 A\u2019s in a 35 person class. The quality of education is great and the premed faculty to help you apply is phenomenal. Just know what you\u2019re getting into.\n\nEdit: Feel free to msg me if you want some more info on applying to medical school. There\u2019s a lot I wish I knew when I started.",

There is no grade deflation without inflation, so I don't really understand what you're getting at. \n\nIf what you really mean to ask is if grading is pretty tough generally, it varies from department to department and professor to professor as you'd expect.",

            "comment": "I would argue that it has a pretty decent balance depending on the department. I would say that sciences and some humanities tend to have more liberal professors while political science and economics professors have some more conservative-leaning professors. \n\nI don't think being a liberal or conservative puts you at any disadvantage. Just don't be rash about the decisions you make or things you say. Having been a POC at Colgate, there have been a number of instances where white students have specifically targeted and defaced non-white student rooms. I know some conservatives who feel threatened any time certain topics come up but as long as you don't take anything personally/try to enforce some ideology upon someone it's fine.",

            "comment": "\"Conservative\" would describe a fairly small number of American colleges and universities and they would not often be among the best. The list of the  highest-ranked politically conservative colleges in the country is not very long. The best colleges which are considered liberal in their social and political outlooks is much longer because that's the nature of college. This is hardly surprising. Good colleges are places of open-minded inquiry. So even a college that is socially and politically in the \"middle\" of all the other colleges is still going to be fairly liberal. It's a little like asking whether an artist is open-minded or closed-minded. What percentage of really good artists are going to be closed-minded people? It wouldn't make much sense, would it? \n\nThis is hardly surprising since most people who go into teaching are fairly open-minded, inquisitive, tolerant, thoughtful people who want to learn more. I was a teacher for about 50 years at four different schools, so that's how I know. Inquisitive people become teachers, and most are not people who generally believe they know all the answers already or have a fixed viewpoint -- or why would they want to keep learning and questioning? \n\nSo it's hardly a surprise most college faculty are fairly progressive and open-minded socially and politically. Not all certainly, but most. Someone is always rediscovering this fact and is amazed by it, and sometimes they use it to make accusations about students being \"indoctrinated\" or something silly  like that. but I have no idea why this surprises anyone. Yes, teachers tend to be generally fairly liberal people. Open-ended discussions are good. Looking at the goods and bads is part of any decent education. Questioning is what colleges are all about. \n\nParents who are bothered by this often insist their children go to one of a fairly small number of \"Christian\" or other conservative colleges. Unfortunately a lot of the most conservative are not particularly outstanding colleges. Put another way, if you listed the top 100 American colleges and universities, you'd have about a 90-10 split liberal or fairly liberal vs. conservative schools. My guesstimate. Maybe 85-15, but no more than that. \n\nColgate fits into this characterization. It's a very open place, but you have a mixture of urban and rural students from large cities and small towns, foreign students, and others, so you're going to find many people of all political types. Colgate is generally somewhere in the broad middle which makes it fairly \"liberal\" generally but not overwhelmingly so, and certainly not nearly as liberal as some schools I know which are hotbeds of protest and where social issues sometimes push academics aside. That's pretty rare at Colgate where students are pretty focused, self-controlled, sane people.",

My current school experience has certainly  not been this.\n\nI'm also not making any assumption about the school...... that's why I'm asking.",

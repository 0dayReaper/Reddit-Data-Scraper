It gives everyone in your class year a chance to connect with the same material; something that won't happen again as you begin to specialize your education. \n\nHonestly this is the first assignment you have at an academically rigorous college. It's not a difficult one. Start off on the right foot and read it.",

The general discussions I had about these books was my first introduction to intellectual life at Colgate. I though I'd gone to a very good high school but apparently not. The level of discussion kind of blew me away. I didn't say much, believe me, but mostly just listened. Then I went up to my room and started reading my course readings even more carefully,",

From what I found on the Colgate website, only the Bryan Complex and 113 Broad Street have Suite Style rooms. I read somewhere on this subreddit that 113 is terrible, is that so? How do I make sure I don't get assigned to it? :\"\"\")  Also, how is suite life at Colgate? \n\nI haven't submitted my form yet, so all suggestions welcome :)",

            "comment": "If by suite-style room you're referring to a single room attached to a larger shared living space (as opposed to just a straight single on the hall), I know Andrews Hall has 2-room doubles on the 2nd and 4th floors- one large main room and one smaller, inner bedroom. I lived in one of them my sophomore year, and while my roommate and I shared the smaller bedroom and reserved the other room as a common space, it's if anything more common for each person to take one room as their own pseudo-single. Typically the 2nd and 4th floors are reserved for sophomores, but AFAIK so is 113, so if you've been informed that that's an option for you it's likely that you might be able to successfully inquire after an Andrews suite. Also, the 1st and 3rd floors, which AFAIK are freshmen-only, have one each of this type of two-person suite.\n\nIf by suite-style you're just referring generally to a larger, multi-room dorm (regardless of the presence of single rooms), Andrews's 1st and 3rd floors consist primarily of 4-person suites, which have two small double bedrooms adjoining a large common room. I believe Stillman Hall might have a similar setup, although I've never actually been inside it so I'm really not sure. Both Andrews and Stillman are centrally located and regarded as two of the better underclassmen dorms on campus, so if you do have access to some special housing process where you have a choice as to where you live I would recommend looking at one of those two dorms for suite-style living. Hope this helps!",

That's actually one of my main reasons for asking for one. \n\nThe deadline to submit the form is 15th June, that's tomorrow :\"\"\") Also, what do you feel is more comfortable to live in, a simple single room or a single room in a suite-style setting?",

Yeah the suites in Andrews don't have attached bathrooms, and I'm not sure about Stillman, so if that's your priority as opposed to a single bedroom or something of the sort, maybe those aren't the best options. I will say that the 1st and 4th floors on Andrews do both have single-person bathrooms in addition to the typical communal bathrooms -- i.e. there's another bathroom with a locking door and a single toilet, sink, and shower stall. The 2nd and 3rd floors may also have a bathroom like this but I personally don't know. It's shared among all residents of the floor as opposed to being attached to one residence, but it's still a lot better and more private than the normal bathroom setup. IDK if that would suffice for you, but maybe something to consider.\n\nI've never been fortunate enough to have a single room, but I think in the context of underclassman housing most people would agree that simple single rooms are slightly preferable to suite-style singles for the simple reason that it's one more level of privacy. Again, I can really only speak for Andrews, but the way the two-single suites in Andrews work is there's one larger room that's attached to the hallway and one smaller room that's accessible from the first room (i.e. not directly from the hallway). Many students choose to split these suites so that each person gets one of the rooms, but the person in the outer room kinda gets the shorter end of the stick because they have to deal with the other person passing through their room every time they're going to and from the inner room. With \"true\" single rooms you don't have to deal with that -- there's one on every floor in East and West halls (and perhaps others elsewhere, not sure), and while they're quite small I know that most people are willing to take that tradeoff.",

This is so helpful, I'm so thankful to you! :\") One last question because now I think I'm going to go for a Simple Single room, what do the communal bathrooms look like?  Do they have doors or curtains? I'm choosing a private room over having a bathroom so I need to think this through :\"\") \n\nThanks again!",

In East, the communal bathrooms have a non-locking door to the hallway. At least in the men's room there are a few urinals and one or two stalled toilets (with doors), and I assume in the ladies' room it's all stalls. There are also two or three shower stalls which are concealed by hanging curtains. Finally there are a few sinks with mirrors along one wall that feature little overhangs where you can put your toiletries and stuff. To be honest the bathrooms in the res halls are not great and are probably the worst part of dorm life, but while I don't know your circumstances, I found that it's one of those things that you just get used to as part of college living.\n\nAlso just want to mention that it's probably worth taking everything I'm saying with a small grain of salt -- I know your class is unprecedentedly large for Colgate, and they're also shuffling some things around at least for upperclassmen housing (I'm a rising senior), so I'm not sure how much of what I'm saying applies for you guys if certain policies have changed. But hope it's useful nonetheless!",

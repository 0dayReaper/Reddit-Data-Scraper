    "postText": "i plan to be a bio major pre-med. cost wise, colgate is my cheapest option (other than hamilton college, which i wasnt too impressed witth). i had my heart set on uni of rochester but my dad didnt like it and its too expensive. \n\ncolgate was never my first choice, but i feel like its my only option at this point. \ni fear that i wont have the same opportunities at a small liberal arts college than i will at a big research university. could someone explain the bio program and how well they prepare you for med school?\n\nanother one of my concerns is the lack of diversity. i come from an inner city 3000 student high school with over 50 languages spoken. as a racial minority myself, i would feel so much more comfortable knowing that there are people like me; non white and on the poorer side. i\u2019m aware they have a strong cultural center, but im still weary. \n\nhow is the arts scene on campus? i really want to keep pursuing my passions for dance and music, but from what ive gathered there just isnt a huge presence of the arts. i hope to be proved wrong.",

            "comment": "Hey! I was also between u of r and Colgate last year and I\u2019m currently at Colgate. I\u2019m pursuing biochemistry which is a little different than bio but here\u2019s my insight: \n\n\u2022 Colgate has lots of research going on to get involved with! It\u2019s not as much medical research as U of r but still lots of STEM stuff\n\n\u2022 obviously rochester has a hospital which is great for pre-meds. Colgate has a small hospital nearby and some people have worked there as emergency dept. technicians and nursing assistants. Quite a few people are EMTs.  \n\n\u2022 As a liberal arts school, you get much smaller classes which allow you to form great relationships with professors which helps for letters of rec. Gen Chem classes have about 25 students and intro bio about 80-90 (much less than the ~300 you\u2019d probably see at U of r) \n\n\u2022 the arts are actually really important at Colgate! Dancefest is one of the biggest and most well attended events all year and there is a huge range of groups (Latin American, ballet, modern, hip hop, ballroom, etc). Super fun!! \nNot super involved with music but I know there\u2019s a pep band (performs at games), orchestra, jazz group(?) and TONS of acapella and choir groups \n\n\u2022 As for diversity, yes Colgate is lacking. There is definitely a space for minorities in different clubs and at the ALANA cultural center. It\u2019s a lot of wealthy white kids but there will people like you too.",

Also easier to connect with professors and not competing with grad students for research. Colgate offers a really cool study \u201cabroad\u201d program doing research at the NIH and I was really excited about that. I was more drawn to the liberal arts curriculum vs the open curriculum at Rochester. Idk sometimes I kind of regret the decision regarding the campus culture (little diversity, lots of emphasis on partying and Greek life) but I really enjoy the academics and professors here.\n\nEdit: I was also admitted to a scholars program at Colgate that provides grants for research, conferences, etc. and that was a huge draw for me personally.",

            "comment": "You're debating whether or not to attend one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country, but you never bothered to look into these questions before you applied? I'm just going to guess you assumed you'd get admitted to some other school(s) so you didn't bother. And now you have to play catch-up. Well, I'll do my best.\n\nI know Hamilton College well and U of Rochester a little bit, and I'd say Colgate is a good deal better if your concern is quality of education and attention from professors and small class sizes, and so on. If it's something else, whatever that might be, I have no idea. So you're fine there. \n\nColgate is definitely not a \"big research university,\" so again, I have to wonder why you applied to Colgate? If you buy a small car, but you prefer a large car, well . . . well, what's going on? Was this just a casual \"I don't really care\" application? \n\nColgate does have a fine Bio/Sciences program and there is scientific research. It has been undertaking a huge science building program and expanding its science offerings. Did you know that or not? Colgate also produces a fair number of doctors which included a couple of my closest friends when I was a student there. And another friend who runs a DNA/Genetics research lab now. So if it's all about becoming a doctor or researcher, I think you're fine. \n\nLack of diversity is pretty common at most smaller colleges, especially rural colleges (since most ethnic minorities live in urban areas and seem to commonly choose to attend colleges nearby). Colgate does have a significant number of minorities, more than some similar schools, perhaps less than some others. But you have to decide that. By definition, a \"minority\" is pretty likely to not be very large almost any place. It's not an urban university if that's what you want, and yes it is pretty white. For what it's worth, my daughter, who is racially-mixed, attended Colgate recently, and for her last two years there, her roommates were here two best friends, an Asian girl and a Black girl. I have no idea what that means to you, but there you go. Look at the website for statistics, visit the campus and look around, or talk to some people from your racial groups who are at Colgate and ask. You can find all this out by contacting the Admissions Office. Do it quickly, obviously. \n\nI understand you're \"weary,\" but aren't we all? In fact, I think I need a nap. \n\nOh, the arts scene. Again, it's not a large college or an urban college It's not going to be anywhere near that of a large university or an urban school. But Colgate does its arts programs pretty well. I assume you know this is a 3,000 student college without any real graduate school -- in a small town out in the country. When I was there I majored in English and Fine Arts, and I loved the Art Department (and the education I got). No, there is not a \"huge presence of the arts,\" but I don't really know what that means exactly. Again you'll need to find out if what Colgate offers in the arts appeals to you. Contact Admissions, go visit, or talk to students or teachers there. \n\nThe things you are asking were really your job to find out before this, so you're going to have to scramble a little. A campus visit would be best, but if you are nowhere near Colgate, that probably isn't going to work for you. There are 15-18,000 other students who applied, but did not get admitted, and wish they were in your shoes right now, so I'm not that sympathetic. I do hope if you decide not to attend, you do it quickly for someone else's sake. . \n\nOr you could take a \"gap year\" off and start the process of applying all over again next year and do more research first. Maybe this time apply to \"large, urban, cheap-to-attend, mixed science and arts universities with large minorities.\" Yeah, that school.",

Unfortunately what he received is almost double the cost of what other colleges offered and more than double his safeties.

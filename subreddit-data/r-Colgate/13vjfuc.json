I got a 1480 superscore on the SAT (1460 best composite score), and had a weighted ~95% average. I only took 5 APs, but I did take several honors courses. I didn\u2019t have more than two years in a varsity sport, but I had a few extracurricular leadership roles. That\u2019s basically it. You need a good personal statement and good recs, though. It\u2019s a good school, but you seem like a good student. It\u2019s totally worth applying. My DMs are open if you want more specific advice!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m a high school senior applying to Colgate as early decision and I\u2019m pretty much stuck on working on my supplements lol. It\u2019s like I know what to write and I have the words to describe it, but it\u2019s somehow difficult for me to put it into sentences. Idk if that made sense but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at with these supplements. Would any students from Colgate would like to share what they wrote for their supplements so I can get some inspiration? :)",

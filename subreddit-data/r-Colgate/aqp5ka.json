Have you checked the admissions website for information on how they do it? \n\nI'm an alum, and Colgate just announced that they had a record year for applications, receiving almost 10,000 for the freshman class of about 750. Of course, they \"accept\" for more (20-25%) in order to get that number so it's not as awful as it might seem. \n\nGood luck. ",

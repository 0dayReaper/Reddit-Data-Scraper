            "comment": "I got you buddy I did the exact same thing. Plug the cord into your laptop/computer (I used a mac) and choose your video. Open the video in Imovie to convert it from a .MOV file to a .mp4 file, then delete the original video by opening up the disk from your desktop and drag and drop the new .mp4 file into it. It can't be too big of a file so anything around or less than the original video's length should be ok. Just a heads up, I have zero knowledge when it comes to technology, so it is very likely that this info is wrong or I used the wrong terminology. Good luck and congrats on your acceptance!",

    "postText": "So I was recently accepted to Colgate as Class of 2025 and had some questions about the Economic department. I tried finding some info on it on the website but couldn\u2019t find anything specific. I want to have a job in financial analysis for some background. Does economic curriculum set one up for a career in finance? Knowing that it is a liberal arts college I am worried that the I won\u2019t be prepared for finance but only theories about supply and demand etc. What are some companies that Econ majors have interned at? How inclusive is the student body, I read online that they, in general, come off as snobby and arrogant. I\u2019m no stranger to those traits as I attend a private prep high school but even here I feel very welcomed. Thanks for your time.",

            "comment": "Congrats! I was an economics and computer science double major and am now working in tech at an NYC financial firm. There are Colgate alumni at virtually all of the big, global financial firms. If you\u2019re looking for a practical, hands-on financial education, studying economics at a liberal arts school may not be for you, as the curriculum is very high level and theoretical by design. However, the networking opportunities you get from going to Colgate open many doors, and sometimes it\u2019s more about who you know than what you know.\n\nI graduated some time ago, but during my time, the attitudes of the students were comparable to private/prep/boarding schools, since that\u2019s where many of the students came from. I would describe the culture as more work hard-play hard/Greek life oriented than snobby/arrogant. I absolutely did not fit into that culture at all but still managed to meet some nice people and find activities that I enjoyed doing. If Admissions gives you the opportunity to talk to current students, I\u2019d recommend doing that, as it will give you the best idea of the current culture.",

The professors were fantastic and most had real-world experience, so classes were engaging and practical for the most part, even the theory-heavy ones. Class sizes were small but that meant you got lots of extra help and attention when you needed it. I\u2019m a professional software engineer now, so clearly the program equipped me well enough.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s important to note is that theory is actually really important in CS IMO. You need theoretical knowledge to understand how to design applications and systems, which is a skill that a surprising number of engineers don\u2019t have. Also, the interviews that the big tech firms conduct are like 90% theory (a practice that I strongly disagree with, but that\u2019s a story for another day). When I interview candidates, I generally look for a 50/50 split of theory to practical knowledge.",

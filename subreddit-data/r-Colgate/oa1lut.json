Are there any resources that I can get access to, to start studying beforehand? (I really need to because as an international student I'm afraid I'll need time to adjust to the new curriculum) It'll be really helpful if a current Biology/Neuroscience/Psych Science Major could guide me or if anybody here could connect me with them :\"\")\n\nAlso, any resources for the FSEMS/Core or advice in general on how to go about academics at Colgate would be great :\"\"\"\"\")",

Do NOT take 5 courses your first year until you get used to the workload. \n\nDon't worry too much if you're feeling any imposter syndrome, I was in the same boat. What I came to realize is that there are a lot of really smart people here who come from good schools but if they're not willing to put in work to succeed it doesn't matter. Learning how to study and work consistently is most of the battle. It seems like you're ready probably a hard worker if you're looking for more work so you'll probably do fine. If you are struggling reach out to your professor and they'll be able to help or set you up with a tutor, and if they know you're working hard to improve they'll probably cut you more slack too.\n\nIt's a great idea to get ahead of the curve if you want to but make sure you are taking some time to chill before classes start, it ramps up pretty quickly!\n\nI'm not psych/bio/Neuro but of you have any other general questions feel free to dm me.",

            "comment": "Current Senior here. Coming to Colgate, you have to know that historically rich white kids from New England make up the school's majority. That being said, Colgate has been very proactive in the past decade or so to increase diversity and create spaces for students from a variety of backgrounds. For example, while the social scene is dominated by Greek life, which is also predominantly white and rich, there are many other clubs and organizations with vibrant social opportunities. Colgate is in an isolated rural area so everyone is around all the time and you get to know your friends really well. \n\nAs someone from a lower income bracket, I was still able to find many friends to relate to and a good social life in clubs I'm involved in. I have met the best people and made lifelong friends at Colgate. In my experience, no matter who you are, you will find your crowd. An added note: imo The true benefit of Colgate really is the next level academic experience, quality of the faculty, and resources for research and off campus studies. \n\nTo answer your other question, the no loan initiative means Colgate's financial aid package will cover all of your demonstrated need without any loans as long as your family income is less than 125k / yr. If it's over that, the aid package will begin to include federal loans. \n\nHope this helps and good luck with your college search!",

A colgate financial aid package normally includes a grant and loans. The no loan initiative simply means you get a larger grant and no federal loans in your package. So for example, if they determine your financial aid package would be $50,000 grant and $8,000 in loans, under the new initiative, it would just be a $58,000 grant. You still have to pay for school some amount. If your income is low enough, the grant will be large enough such that you don't pay anything. Expect to have to do a work study job as well to contribute to your education.",

            "comment": "In a large school, not only do people often get lost among all the people, they also get distracted by everything that's going on. If you think, as you should, that college is primarily to get a great education, that's a problem both in the social life department and the academic department. \n\nEnter the world of small colleges! \n\nI'd think it would be almost impossible not to make a few good friends, as well as many other casual friends, at any school like Colgate -- a small college in a small town with tough academics, and so on. I went to Colgate decades ago and made many good friends. My daughter went to Colgate less than a decade ago, and it was the same for her. \n\nA lot of social life at Colgate, like most other places, is parties. But I'm afraid that's the way it is at nearly all colleges. It never bothered me. I went to a few, but skipped most. You'll still find lots of people studying on Saturday night. Your academic responsibilities come first, and Colgate students know that. There are a huge number of quiet study places all over campus if you want to get away and study. \n\nFrat life used to dominate Colgate, but it's less influential today. When I went to Colgate decades ago there were fifteen fraternities -- which was ridiculous -- and all social life was in the frat s. Today, there are only a few left (maybe five?) plus two or three sororities. To me, fewer is better. Social life doesn't just revolve around parties, but around getting together with friends and being in clubs and other activities. Because it's a small college in a small town, everyone is in the same boat, so you end up getting to know a lot of people you wouldn't have known in other types of colleges. You do that in the dorms and in activities, or by living together off campus, hanging out and talking or listening to music, by traveling (Colgate has a huge off-campus study program to many different places), and so on.  \n\nThey're not all rich kids, by the way, though it seems like it at times. Most of my closest friends, I found out later, were on some kind of work-study or financial aid program that I'd never noticed. One guy I knew cut people's hair in the bathroom to make some extra money. I just figured he enjoyed doing that, but I realized later he was on full scholarship. His Dad was a barber back in his home town, so I guess that's where he learned! \n\nColgate has a pretty decent mixture of races, religions, and nationalities. They claim to have about 25% racial minorities but I'm not sure how they calculate that, so who knows? You'll be just fine. My daughter lived with her two best friends during her junior and Senior years in a campus apartment, one an African-American girl, the other a Chinese-American girl. If that matters to you. There must be some racism at Colgate, but I never saw any. Of course, I'm pretty white. My fraternity (yep, I was in one) was not a cliched bastion of spoiled white guys. We had whites, Blacks, Indians, foreign students, many religions, gays and straights.None of that was an issue, and it wasn't even talked about. One advantage of Colgate is that it draws heavily from urban areas like NYC where intelligent young people tend not to be narrow-minded or racially clueless. That was my experience, anyway. \n\nSorry, I don't know much about the financial aid situation. You'd do best to just call the financial aid office and ask them directly. I'm sure they have all the answers you want. \n\nGood luck!",

While at Rutgers I developed a new, easy to use bus app, and now I'm proud to announce I am bringing the app to Colgate University!\n\nMy app is free to download on the App Store, and I would love for you to give it a try. All feedback is appreciated!\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1138430605?pt=10114193&amp;ct=colgate&amp;mt=8",

            "comment": "Part 2: Play sports of some kind. If you're not on a team already, you might be able to be a \"walk on\" if you're any good. Go talk to the coaches. If not, play club sports. My daughter went to Colgate and was a soccer player but not quite good enough to be on that team. So she joined the Women's Rugby team which takes everyone and become a major star and absolutely loved it. There are a huge number of club sports teams you can join even if you're not much of an athlete. DO THIS. No really. I'm serious. You need the exercise. Look at you, you're already putting on weight, aren't you? \n\nIn classes, the first few weeks really matter. Don't skip any. Do the reading. Take good notes. Talk to your classmates about the readings and maybe meet to talk about them. You want to start off doing well. I didn't because I had weird study habits and didn't talk to classmates, thinking I could do it all myself. I wrote down everything in the lecture. Don't do that. Stupid. Instead, write down the main points, the themes or whatever and a few examples only. NOT everything. And I read every word I was assigned. Even more stupid. All those books you'll be assigned cannot physically be read in the time you have. So, find out what they're about and write down some notes about that. Read the intro, read the conclusion, read the chapter titles, read some parts of the book. You'l get the idea. Except for massively long works of literature or science and math textbooks this will work for you. If you sit down and talk about what you're learning in a class with another student or two it really helps clarify what you need to remember and can help straighten out any confusions you have. I had lots of confusions -- about Plato, Aristotle, the French Revolution, Shakespeare, all tose guys, you name it. I was a mess. Don't be a mess. Talk to people. \n\nTalk to your professors. It can be brief, just a few minutes, but go see them. Just set up an appointment, then ask some questions and be friendly. After 5-10 minutes, leave. You've shown interest but you haven't lingered too long. You might be their only student conference of the week. This really matters to teachers. I became a teacher (history) and a good one, and students who came in to talk about the subject were always my favorites. It helps if the professors know you. In class, always ask questions and contribute. Don't be one of the silent ones. Even if you get Old Doc Cranky, even with him ask a question every day. If you're interested in the subject he/she teaches, he'll like you more. Ask questions. As you leave class sometimes, pause and say \"That was really interesting\" or \"I love this subject\" or \"What a great book that was\" but just don't be a suck up about it. You have to mean it. \n\nDrinking. I wouldn't do this much, but it's your choice. If you become known as a drinker, you lose. You get considered kind of a jerk. There's LOTS of drinking at Colgate (surprise!) but keep it to a minimum. When I was there, everyone guzzled beer all the time. The place smelled like a brewery. At parties, I used to walk around holding a beer just to be sociable and maybe sip on it a little at times. But I fucking hated beer. Being sociable is good; drinking a lot is not good. Yes, go to parties. Just don't drink much. Also listen to people there and have fun. \n\nTry to remember people's names. Practice this. People love it if you know their name. Nodding or saying \"hi\" is good, buy saying \"Hey, Stanislaus, how's it going?\" is a thousand times better. Or even better, \"You still working on that symphony, Billy Bob\" People love it when you remember their interests and are interested in them. \"You still dating your sister?\" works for some people. \n\nIt's going to be great and it will go by faster than you can imagine. Have fun. Go Gate! \u0010",

            "comment": "Stay away from that short kid in 203! You'll understand soon enough. Talk about weird. And his hands are always sticky with something. I can only imagine what he's been up to in there. Just STAY AWAY FROM THE SHORT KID IN 203, that's all I can say. Holy smokes. \n\nGo 'Gate indeed.\n\nOkay, some serious tips:\n\nPart 1: You don't say what dorm you're in which might help. You don't say if you have a roommate or roommates plural which would help. \n\nGenerally, leaving your door open for at least the first few days and then occasionally after that will allow you to meet more people. And you want to meet more people. They can give you advice, become friends, go to meals with you, and just generally make the transition to college nicer. Leaving out a box of cookies might be going a little too far, but maybe walk around with it and offer them to people in neighboring rooms once or twice. If you Mom sends brownies, pass them around. Don't be a pig. Spread the love. \n\nIf you end up with assholes as roommates as I did, don't despair. Just be as nice and tolerant as you can be. I ended up with two enormous giraffes of basketball players who talked incessantly about nothing else -- ever -- and bounced a ball in the room all - the - time. Talk about getting sick and tired of people. Then they went through my stuff and left it scattered around for some reason. They were slobs . . . and so on. Not nice. Not everyone is a civilized person, so you might have to put up with some people. At the end of the semester I went down to the Housing Office (there is such a thing) and calmly explained my situation and they found me a new freshman dorm room which I moved to. No problem at all and I got to meet a lot of new people that way, too. Kind of ruined my first semester, though, unfortunately. \n\nDon't be an asshole yourself, either. Don't dominate conversations but listen more than you talk. Volunteer to help people do things. Keep the music down. People need to study and sleep and some people are going to nap in the middle of the day at times. Keep the smell of your drugs minimal. Don't drink all the time. Don't whoop and scream in the hallways or people are going to quickly hate you. Don't play dorm hockey. Well, I suppose you can do that a little. Oh, and the most important piece of advice: DO NOT SLAM THE BATHROOM DOOR, YOU FUCKING IDIOT! The door on the bathroom will inevitably have a door closer that slams it closed every - damn - time including at 2:00 in the morning Be sure you don't do that. Here's a way to stop that from happening. \n\nAsk everyone on your floor to not slam the bathroom door. Smile. Nah, that's clearly not ever going to work. \n\nGo to the hardware store or order from Amazon some of those small pads people stick on the bottom of vases and boxes so they don't scratch the furniture. Some are fabric, some are rubberized. Place a few of those alone the edge of the bathroom door where it slams. It will cut the noise down dramatically. Keep the extras and replace them periodically when they fall off. It will make sleeping absolute heaven instead of being constantly awakened by a loud SLAM from the bathroom. And that bathroom door will always be directly across the hall from you. Why is that? \n\nIntroduce yourself to people for at least the first few weeks, but don't be \"needy\" about it. Just do your gentlemanly thing: \"Hi, I'm Joe Blow from Kokomo, who are you?\" is good enough. Then smile. People love to know who other people are -- and they love to have someone ask who they are. If someone says they're from Gooberville or Indiana or Prague, be honest and say \"I've never been there. What's it like?\" Get them talking to you. Everyone has opinions about where they come from. Don't be smarmy about small town people, either. Just because they come from a farm or some nowhere town doesn't mean they're not the nicest people you ever met - -or the smartest sometimes. Show genuine interest in people. After a few weeks you might stop asking people so much, but for awhile just meeting people in your dorm or your classes is a really good idea. Just don't be needy or force it on people. Don't be always sticking our your paw for a handshake or you'll look like a politician and no one likes a politician. That can get annoying. \n\nIn a group, saying \"Anyone else got Kistler for Philosophy?\" is always a good idea if you want to find other people in your classes or just get info on what the likes and dislikes of a prof are. You want to know that so you have some good advice to go on to survive academically. \n\nAlso really try to meet uperclassmen and women. Do NOT hang out only with people in your own class. You need older people's advice about which courses to take, which to not take, profs you don't want to miss, those you do want to miss, and so on. Fraternities, Sororities, and upper class dorms are full of this kind of advice, and it can be very very useful. So visit them at times. \n\nStop by other people's rooms for a minute or two, and just be a nice person. Some people will resent it, others will love it. Not everyone is going to want to be your friend, but you need to know that and stay away from those people. Chatting and listening to other people is important throughout your life. Always say \"hi\" or nod or smile at people. And compliment what needs complimenting. If someone has a good dorm room, compliment them. If someone is from a place you've always wanted to visit, compliment them. If someone is good at something, ask how they learned it. Find good things to say. People will like you. \n\nJoine some organizations. Yes yes yes, do this. The newspaper is good, but so are clubs and so on. You need to meet people, including upperclassmen and women. It will help you immensely and calm down your anxieties. This is really important so you don't end up isolated with just two friends. You need a network of people you know and can ask for advice and learn from. About half of the learning at a school like Colgate is out of the classroom on sports teams, clubs, publications, and so on. \n\nJoin a frat or sorority if that's your thing. I did and it changed my whole Colgate life which up to that point had been spent dealing with two asshole roommates I'd gotten stuck with. You'll meet lots of people, most will be nice, some will be highly intelligent (my frat had the highest GPA on campus of ANY fraternity or upper class dorm -- so take that, suckers!). It saved my Colgate life. I dropped out of the frat after less than two years because I'd grown up a lot, but in the meantime it was very very helpful. Upper class dorms might be as helpful but they weren't back when I was at Colgate.",

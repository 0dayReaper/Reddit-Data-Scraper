I am an international student not applying for financial aid, and I really like both Colgate and Vassar but want to choose between the two because they're highly similar in terms of sat scores, tuition, graduation rates etc.\n\nI wanted to know the key differences between the two universities, pros and cons, the culture and any information that would be helpful for me to know make an informed decision.\n\nAny information would help! Thank you so much for your taking out your time for this!!",

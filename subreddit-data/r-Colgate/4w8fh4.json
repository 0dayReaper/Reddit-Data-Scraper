    "postText": "Hello! I am a student interested in potentially attending Colgate University. I have visited and loved the campus and setting, and overall Colgate looks very attractive to me. However, I have come across a notion a couple times online that worries me. I have seen written that Colgate has a pervasive drinking culture and that fraternities dominate the social scene for males.\n\nI personally have no interest in drinking or Greek life (though I don't believe I would mind my peers drinking lightly around me), so I am worried that I might be a bit out of place on the Colgate campus. I wanted to ask how true the idea is and how much of a place there might be for someone like me. ",

            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nI came to Colgate with a very similar mindset. I didn't drink much during my time at Colgate (still don't) and I had no interest in Greek life. \n\nDrinking culture is indeed very prevalent on campus, as is the social prominence of Greek organizations. \n\nHowever, I was lucky to find friends during my freshman year that were not interested in joining Greek life. Having these friends, who still were more into drinking than I, made life at Colgate a great experience despite the fact that I did not engage in heavy drinking or Greek life. \n\nHaving friends that you can count on to be there for you when you need them, and that understand your personal preferences makes the situation perfectly workable and truly enjoyable. \n\nAll that being said, I want to caution you about the impact of Colgate's very real remoteness. If you don't have a car, you are effectively stuck on campus. That means that you can never get away into a different place for new/better/different food, you can't get away from the drama on campus, you can't get away from people for even a little while. Even if you do have a car, Syracuse is your nearest \"big\" city, and Syracuse is not a great place. There were definitely times during my 4 years that I withdrew into myself for a week to deal with stress and/or relationship issues with my friend group. I think, in a bigger city, I would have been more able to decompress more quickly and more easily. \n\nSo, TL;DR: Yes, Greek life and the associated drinking culture are prominent on campus. And, yes, you can build a place for yourself on campus. Some aspects of social life (and student government) will be very hard to access, without engaging in Greek life and heavy drinking, but on the whole, you can have a great time. Just remember that it is hard to leave campus even for a weekend to get away from things. Colgate can be very insular. ",

            "comment": "Hi hope this is not a too late response, I'm going to be a junior on campus and think I can answer some of your questions. Drinking I would say is very prevalent but at least for me people were very accepting in my lack of desire to drink. First year guys who do want to drink and party do have limited options but there are always social drinking/partying in rooms, going to the Jug, and the occasional open house party. Based on your response you would probably not be partaking in those activities often, which is perfectly fine. That was (and still is me most of the time), you can easily find people who will go to the movies, play video games, board games etc. Clubs and other campus groups often having activities on the weekend that serve as an alternative to parties and drinking. PM me or reply if you have anymore questions or want me to clarify. This is a great school and I hope you seriously consider it.",

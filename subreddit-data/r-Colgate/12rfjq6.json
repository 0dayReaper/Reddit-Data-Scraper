    "postText": "i was just recently admitted to colgate, and i love the academic repertoire that the school has. the campus is beautiful, and it seems like an incredibly well rounded university!! i\u2019m just worried about location, though\u2026 the population of hamilton itself is equal to that of the college, and i was wondering if students actually spend any time in the town or just stay on campus. \n\nalso (apologise for this question being off topic!!), i\u2019ve heard some negative comments about greek life and diversity\u2014 anything to add to this?",

I\u2019m a current freshman at Colgate so I\u2019ve been here almost a full year and basically students spend a decent amount of time in the town especially on the weekends but it is also extremely small so it can still be really isolating. If you or one of your friends has a car then that definitely makes a huge difference as it gives you more freedom and can help reduce the suffocating feeling of being stuck in Hamilton. Freshmen aren\u2019t allowed to rush at Colgate, you can rush starting sophomore year so Greek life isn\u2019t a huge thing for freshmen. If you enjoy partying then your main options freshmen year are the Jug and DU which is the football frat that hosts a decent amount of open parties. For the most part though frat parties are closed unless you know someone or are in Greek life. The jug is pretty good freshmen year though because you get to know a lot of people since it\u2019s usually the same people going every weekend.",

It can definitely be a difficult place at times when you don't fit perfectly into the mold of the archetypal Colgate person, but I've talked to lots of friends about this topic and we all agree that there's a certain sort of \"outsider solidarity\" among non-Greek-affiliated people that leads to really tight bonds and a strong sense of camaraderie. There were points at which I felt very lonely and wished I were at school somewhere less isolated or heavily Greek-leaning, but those times are outnumbered 10 to 1 by the times I've felt grateful for having had the community of my friends and classmates. With a little effort on their part I really think almost anyone can make a good life for themselves at Colgate. It's a cliche but honestly do try signing up for clubs and interest groups.\n\nIn general I think that Colgate can occasionally feel small in the sense that after a certain point everyone kind of knows everyone's business, but realistically speaking I never ran out of new people to meet. Also, the huge upside of Colgate's small size is the fact that it's located in an extremely gorgeous and relatively unique part of the country. Coming from a suburban background and feeling ambivalent about the isolation, it had an extremely profound effect on me and it's honestly what I miss the most about Colgate. I can't speak for everybody, but I wouldn't have traded that location and proximity to nature for any increase to the student body size.",

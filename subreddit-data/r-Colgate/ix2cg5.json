            "comment": "It's my impression that Colgate pretty much fills up its incoming classes every year, and while it may have a few students who drop out or transfer to other schools, it won't have a whole lot of spots for transfers. That being said, there's no reason a talented student with a good record might not get admitted. The details about how to do that and how often it can be done will be with the Colgate Admissions Office which you should, of course, talk to. I'd pretty much pump them for information rather than relying on the very rare anecdotal info from someone who might have applied to transfer in and got in or didn't get in. That's going to be a fairly rare species.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I transferred to Colgate last semester as a freshman. I can personally answer a few questions regarding my transfer class and some hints on getting accepted. Regarding your question on difficulty: the 2019 spring transfer class, I believe, had around 110 applications and only ended up accepting eight students, including one athlete. This number puts Colgate's transfer acceptance rate closer to Stanford, Duke, Dartmouth, and Yale. With that being said, I do believe that the admissions office preferences both regional, racial, and economic diversity while accounting for the institution you are transferring from. Personally, coming from a small town in the upper midwest helped make up for my horrendous ACT math score. It appears that being from Westchester, Connecticut, and Mass puts you at a disadvantage in the transfer process, but it doesn't eliminate you from contention. I'd also recommend several tips which may increase your chances at acceptance:\n\n1. Gather upwards of 3 recommendation letters from diverse areas of interest. My notes consisted of my college Arabic professor, my high school AP Psych teacher, and my high school basketball coach. The letters will give the Admissions office better insight into you as a person.\n2. I'd encourage you to reach out to the admissions officers to get them familiar with your name and the person behind it, thus giving you an advantage over an applicant of a similar caliber.\n3. In your transfer essay, I would emphasize the amazement you have with Colgate's alumni network. The school prides itself on its tight nit and powerful alumni connections. ( I'm personally amazed by how intense and well structured the alumni student relationship truly is)\n\nWhile transferring into Colgate can be extremely difficult, I encourage you to pursue the challenge. I have loved every minute of my Colgate experience regarding friends, nightlife, academic rigor, student-professor relations, the food, and best of all, the insane opportunities provided to me as a result of my Colgate connection. If you have any questions, feel free to DM, and good luck!",

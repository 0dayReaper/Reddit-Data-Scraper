How are housing, student organizations, healthcare, etc? Have you ever had problems because of gender/sexuality?",

            "comment": "Hey there! Colgate is honestly one of the most welcoming, accepting places in the country compared to some anecdotes I\u2019ve heard from friends who go to other comparable private liberal arts schools. As you said, there are tons of resources and communities available for LGBTQ+ people to connect with others, share experiences, and just simply feel like you\u2019re valid and your voice matters. My own academic dean is a non-binary person, and a great advocate for gender-nonconforming people on campus. RAs (we call them CLs, or Community Leaders) like myself are put through two weeks of training where our focus is on learning to build a community in the dorms focused on making people feel at home, and making LGBTQ+ people aware that this is a place where they\u2019ll be accepted and welcomed is one of our paramount goals. I\u2019d be lying if I said every student on campus is a great person who accepts trans people\u2019s gender as valid because I don\u2019t know that, but overall the campus culture is extremely hostile to people who aren\u2019t tolerant of others. There are plenty of sheltered rich white kids who don\u2019t understand the struggle of being LGBTQ+, but the fraction of those people who would ever act on those feelings is infinitesimally small.\n\nEdit: I should add that I\u2019m an out bisexual cis man in a male-female relationship, but am good friends with people from all across the gender and sexuality spectrum. One of the CLs I worked with in my building is non-binary and came out as such during the fall semester, and as far as I\u2019m aware they were met with nothing but open arms and acceptance from both faculty and students alike.",

She loved it, made good friends, and felt it was very egalitarian and friendly. So there's that. You'll need a good winter coat, but it is an amazingly beautiful place.",

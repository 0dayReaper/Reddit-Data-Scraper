It's a world of a difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut other than burke or pinchin probably Bryan Complex",

You're in your first-year dorm for about nine months. Remember your freshman year in high school? Probably not very well. That's how long your freshman year in college will last -- about two blinks of the eye and you're done. Don't sweat what dorm you'r in. \n\nAlso, it is possible at the end of the semester to request that the Housing Office change your dorm room if necessary.",

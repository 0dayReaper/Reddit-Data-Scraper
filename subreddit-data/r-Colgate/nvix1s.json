I\u2019m an incoming freshman at Colgate, and I\u2019m trying to decide whether or not to do the journalism pre-orientation program or to just wait until regular orientation. As usual, I\u2019ve waited till the very last minute to make a decision (the sign-up form is due tomorrow!), and I would really appreciate your advice and thoughts on the program if you have done it before. Cheers! (:",

    "postText": "Hello, question for current students: I'm an alum myself (2012) and am now a college counselor, bringing a group of high school juniors up to Colgate to visit in a few weeks on a Saturday. I was wondering, what's the best place to bring them to eat on campus on a Saturday late afternoon? \n\nI was thinking the Coop, but the website says that it's closed on the weekends -- can that really be true? I think there are a lot of newer spots than from my time, so if anyone had any thoughts, that would be really helpful.\n\nMaybe we can go to town for some Slices, but not sure that's in the cards, lol.\n\nThank you!",

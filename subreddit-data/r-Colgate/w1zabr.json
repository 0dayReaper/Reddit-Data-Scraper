When they say test optional they mean test optional and won\u2019t hold it against you if you don\u2019t submit scores. \nThey look closely at class rank, activities and achievements. They want someone who is well rounded and has good recommendations that show they are of good character.",

The obvious point is your academic readiness and qualification needs to be plain to see without a score to help demonstrate it.",

I was really impressed that they looked at the whole application; to the point that they quoted one line from one of the recommendations - so it really seemed that they read through each one and really looked at the applicant for who they are.  So yes, you have a chance if you don't submit to Colgate.",

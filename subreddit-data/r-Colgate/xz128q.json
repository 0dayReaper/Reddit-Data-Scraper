Remember that American universities are not just looking for people who have scored high in grades or exams, but people who are interesting, have done some interesting things, have skills (languages, music, art, etc) or interesting jobs, and so on. Your scores/grades are not the only thing admissions people look at. They look at who you are and what you've done. Good luck!",

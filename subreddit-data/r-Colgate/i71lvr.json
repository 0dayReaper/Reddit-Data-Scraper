    "postText": "I am a high school senior from India and I was wondering if someone could answer some questions. Specifically about the difference in culture, the housing(how it works), racism, sexual assaults, financial aid and diversity. I've also heard about the shuttle that goes to Syracuse, is that safe? Is it hard to travel from Colgate if you don't live in the US? How easily can you make friends as an international student? Are they a lot of safety related incidents on campus?",

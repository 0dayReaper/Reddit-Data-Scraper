    "postText": "So how bad is the weather there REALLY?   I see weather next week looks wonderful, but running out of days in the school year.  How would you rate weather as a % of good vs bad during the school year?  I realize this is subjective, but curious what people who go there think.   I suspect the summer are amazing, but won\u2019t be in class then!!",

April warms up and is nice, may is pretty solid, June a little better than may, July is blazing hot, august drops a bit but you\u2019ll still get some really hot days, September cools off but it stays warm for most of the month, snow will come by sometime in October however it\u2019ll have some nice days, November you\u2019ll start to see consistent freezing temps, and December is frigid",

            "comment": "Early Fall and late spring are nice, usually when the campus looks best with relatively warm weather until around October. From Halloween to like April expect like 70% of the days to be cloudy and fairly cold. The coldest it can get it probably around -30 with wind chill, but average will be around 30-40. You get used to it fairly quickly, though, the campus is well equipped for this kind of weather so you will be fine as long as you bring a coat and some sweaters. Although when you become 3rd and 4th years you are forced to get housing down the hill and it can be a bit of a pain dealing with the weather if you don't have a car.  Overall, I don't mind the weather too much, but if you don't like the cold then this may not be the place for you.",

            "comment": "Graduated last year. I'm from California and never got snow growing up. The winters at Colgate are certainly long, cold, and snowy, but if you're properly prepared (good boots, coat, layering skills) it's not a big deal. Granted, I generally like cold weather and know that people who felt averse to it had less patience for Hamilton's climate, but just make sure to take care of yourself and it's a total breeze.\n\nTo answer your question, I would say that the weather is sunny and/or 60+ degrees maybe 30% of the school year, but in the first and last two months of the school year it's basically heaven on Earth, and the winters are very beautiful in their own way too. Central New York never stopped wowing me throughout my four years there.",

Thing about Hamilton is that it\u2019s really humid during the summers and just a ton of snow during the winter. If you\u2019re not used to cold winters it can be brutal, but to me it felt better than a Chicago winter, just a lot of snow. \n\nIn my 4 years there, there were maybe a handful of nights where it was too cold to go out.",

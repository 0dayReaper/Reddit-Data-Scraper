            "comment": "Athletic facilities are along Broad St. just south of the campus. Academic buildings are scattered on \"the hill\" along with freshman dorms as well as being on the \"middle campus\" which is the area just below the hill. \n\nColgate's architectural style is varied, but it is coherent because of the use of of grey stone for nearly all the buildings. It's a very smart decision and it sets the look of Colgate apart from so many campuses build of brick (boring) or made up of discordant buildings some of which are nice while others are awful. Nearly every building at Colgate looks like a college building should look. \n\nMy favorite buildings decades ago when I went to Colgate were (a) what was called the Fine Arts Center at the time. Not sure if that's still its name, but its the rough-concrete building you can see at the bottom of the hill along Broad Street designed by the brilliant architect, Paul Rudolph. I virtually lived in that building. It saved me from depression during the cold winter months and gave me a reason to live -- art and music. And (b) Chapel House which is tucked up a small road behind Stillman Hall (a freshman dorm on the hill). It's a great place for quiet thinking, meditation, and just getting away from people for a few minutes which I apparently needed to do at times. \n\nThe current Admissions Building dates back to the Gilded Age and was originally the college library, and it's a very good-looking building. There's a new career center, new science buildings, recent art buiildings, new freshman dorms, and so on. The first two buildings on campus were East Hall and West Hall right in the middle of the campus on the hill. They're now freshman dorms and very handsome early 19th century stone buildings if you're into architecture as I am. I lived in East Hall. The chapel is iconic at the end of the \"quad\". The little old red stone trimmed building at the end of the quad was always one of my favorites. I think it's now the Philosophy Dep't or something but in my day we called it \"Old Bio\" because it had science classrooms. \n\nAlong Broad Street for many years were large homes occupied by fraternities, fifteen of them when I was at Colgate. There are today a few remaining fraternities, a few sororities, plus some homes turned into \"special interest\" houses where students with similar interests can live. Upper class student apartments are scattered around the south end of the campus from the hill downward and across Broad Street toward the athletic areas. \n\nIt's not a large campus, by any means, and if you start anywhere and just kind of loop around from one area and one building to another, you'll end up seeing most everything in a few hours. Go inside, look around, and get a sense of what's going on. It's great. \n\nThe main thing missing from campus is the book store which is \"downtown\" at the main intersection in Hamilton. It's about a mile from campus to downtown to go to the bookstore or get something to eat in town, and it's a nice walk even in winter. The town is pretty decent for a small town in Upstate New York, not quite a perfect New England style town, but this is not New England and was not settled by tidy religious people but by hard-working farmers and so on in the early 19th century. Colgate helps maintain a lot of the town through its donations, especially the Colgate Inn which is more than decent. Go in there for a drink or snack unless you'd prefer a restaurant in the area which will be heavily pizza and such college foods. Outside the town is another pretty good inn called the Hamilton Inn (northeast of town) a few short miles up Route 87 if you want a nicer place to eat and really good food. It's on the south side of Lake Moraine which Colgate uses for crew training. You'll see a really good golf course in that area at the north end of campus which Colgate also operates. \n\nThe overall look of the Colgate campus is pretty spectacular with buildings up above on the hill and down the hill surrounded by green lawns and large trees with a pond (called \"Taylor Lake\") at the very bottom. In fact, it's regularly called one of the most beautiful college campuses in the country. It's where you'd film a movie about college life. Once upon a time Colgate even had a ski hill at the far south end of the campus right on Broad Street, but it's been closed for years probably out of fear of liability issues, but imagine going to college with your own ski area on campus. Kind of cool. \n\nI should add that one of my daughters went to Colgate a few years ago, and she arrived on campus without ever having seen the school (since we live in California). Just pictures. She loved the place. It's a \"work hard, play hard\" kind of school, so get ready. \n\nHave fun! Go 'Gate!",

            "comment": "We were just there Monday for an admitted students visit. After the tour, we spent about two hours just walking around on our own. Pretty much every building is open and you can walk right in. We went in the library, Frank Dining Hall (where the nice lady at the check in let us walk around for a bit), the English building, science building, even the basketball arena. I would stop in at the admissions building first and talk to them. They\u2019re super nice, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give you a map and have some other recommendations. Also, maybe think about calling admissions and seeing if they have a cancellation or even if they can squeeze you in. You never know. Congratulations on your admission! My daughter loved it and the visit sealed it for her.",

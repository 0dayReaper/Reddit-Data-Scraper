This is likely something only pre-meds would know much about, soooo not likely you'll get a lot of info here about this. \n\nOr call up the admissions office and ask that question. That should be able to get you a good answer. \n\nAnd finally, call the relevant academic department(s) like Bio and ask them. Three of my roommates at Colgate many years ago were bio or bio-chem majors who went on to become two medical doctors and one bio-chem Ph.D. researcher. It happens all that time at Colgate which has a long history of producing such people. Also business people, educators, journalists . . . .\n\nGood luck.",

There is not a lot of organized external science stuff, but within the bio department itself there are endless talks, presentations, guest speakers, poster sessions, and the like. Imo colgate is an underrated place for Biology and actually has quite a robust department that's very active in a variety of research areas relevant to pre med including cancer research, genetics, and physiology. Motivated students get the opportunity to work in the lab as research assistants if they seek it out.",

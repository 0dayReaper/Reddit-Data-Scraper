Class Vice President, NHS Officer , Academic All Star, Athlete of Academic Distinction, Played varsity sports in high school, lots of clubs and community involvement. The admissions officer who congratulated me later on through correspondence said one of my recommendations stood out because I was described as someone who cares about others and is always working towards self betterment. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I know they look for smart kids with good character and who are well rounded.",

They cover low income students with grants and aid (no merit scholarships, all need based) they even cover books on top of tuition, room and board, meal plan. Check out the colgate commitment as it explains how aid works for low income students. I\u2019m in that category and all I owed for the entire year is $1,400 dollars and I paid that with my community scholarships that I got from high school. Crazy when you consider the cost of Colgate is about $80,000. Best financial aid package I was offered, hands down.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a freshman, but I only completed my Fall 2022 semester, I was doing my spring semester but had to take it off due to family issues. I've been looking for information about how easy it is to get in with my current stats but I get mixed information.\n\nHS Stats: 4.0 GPA(UW), 4.22 GPA (W), Rank #1, No test scores, significant Work experience in a foreign country (I've been working since I was 14, and I'm currently 19), Strong student government and activism extracurriculars (Host of an event on Women's day and winning research paper in economic sustainability during Senior year of HS), good recommendations\n\nCollege Stats: 3.46 GPA, 12 credits + AP Calc BC credits (4), strong student government activities (Elected as treasurer and first-year senator of my college's leading governance association, Allocated 1.1 million for my college's student organization, leader of residential life committee (All in 1st semester in a top liberal arts college). good recommendations.\n\nI'm also worried about financial aid because the maximum I can pay out of pocket is 5000 (My EFC is 3400 and my family's income is 62k) and I'm not sure how financial aid is handled for transfers here)",

            "comment": "No one can \"chance\" anyone, really, as all admissions are up to largely unknown human factors -- \"is there room for you at Colgate?\" being one of them. Does Colgate need another student like you? If some people have left, that may open a path for you to be admitted, but if not . . . . So, it's hard to guess. But your stats are very good ones, so you may have as good a chance of transferring into Colgate as anyone. And of course it also depends on the competition. Given the size of Colgate (3,000), if 30 people are applying for transfer admission, I'd think that would make it a lot harder for you than if 5 people were applying. \n\nYou don't say why you want to transfer from one \"top liberal arts college\" to another, so I wonder if the Admissions people might want to know that. Not sure, and maybe it's irrelevant, but they do want students who want to stay there until they graduate. In fact, it's a relevant college rating statistic as the number admitted students who do not actually graduate is considered not so good. Admissions people would be aware of this, so they might be wondering if you're just \"shopping\" schools and might leave later, and that might be a concern. But, again, that may not be an issue at all. \n\nIf I were you, I'd emphasize your activism -- and especially your foreign work experience -- as evidence of your maturity and commitment. If you're not just \"another\" 4.0 kid who joined some clubs, you should make that very clear. Colgate will like that. \n\nAs for financial aid, Colgate gives a lot of that. It has a stated policy of giving a great deal aid to lower-income students so that some of them get a free ride -- or at least a lot of aid. At your family's income level, you clearly qualify. And there are \"work-study\" programs, too, that reduce tuition a lot. But that's up to the financial aid office which you should definitely talk to in order to understand their policies and the likelihood of aid. Just phone them or email. \n\nIn any case, you'll never know if you don't apply, will you? I have no idea what the deadline for transfer applications is, if Colgate even has a such a deadline, but you'll know. Good luck!",

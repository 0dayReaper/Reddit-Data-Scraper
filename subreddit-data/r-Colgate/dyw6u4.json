    "postText": "\nI decided to apply via the common app, with a 3.6ish GPA, maybe 3 extra curriculars (choir, DECA, guitar), 1100 SAT score, and few honors/AP classes, (AP gov, honors English 11, college law, college statistics, college English). I figured my stats were alright. But the more I research the more disheartened I am. I'm sure you can't make a super accurate judgement without reading my essay or question responses on the common app but anything is good.",

If you already toured, go up again for a football game or other event and make sure to stop by the Admissions office.\n\nIf you can't visit due to distance, reach out to the admissions office and see if they have any local events for prospective students.  See if you can speak to an alumni or current student to get a feel for the university.\n\nColgate has a very strong community and alumni network.  They want students who will add to that mentality.  By going the extra mile to learn more and get involved with the school now, the more they will notice you.\n\nYou've got nothing to lose. Good luck!",

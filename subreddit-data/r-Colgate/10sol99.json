    "postText": "hey guys, I applied to colgate university for my ED 2. I keep on getting emails from colgate regarding different topics. I got the 'This is Colgate Success' email last week and then today, I got 'Hello from Hamilton N.Y' email. When I looked up the Hello email, they said that it was a tradition on campus. I don't know if it means something or not but could someone confirm this for me pls?",

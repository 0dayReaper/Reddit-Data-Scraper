            "comment": "What I would recommend is at least 2 jackets. A lighter one that you'll wear in spring/fall and nicer winter days. Could maybe be a nice brand. The kinda thing you'd wear indoors at w cold movie theater or something. Like a North face or something, I had a fleece lined port authority jacket worked super well. \n\nThen you have your artic tundra jacket you're gonna break out for a few weeks in the worst parts of winter. This is something big with a solid hood and you're still gonna wear a hoodie and 1-2 more layers under it anyways. Some companies are actually putting like heating elements inside the jacket if you've got the money for that I'd imagine that's nice, Ive never tried it. But this is the jacket that is gonna get you through the days it's actively snowing and when we get a frostbite warning.  I went to an LLbean and just talked to the guys there. Think I got a Patagonia jacket which worked pretty well. If you're there all 4 years there will be a few days where it hurts to breathe outside its so cold, my sophomore year we hit -20 I think.  So you need something that can handle sub zero temperatures. \n\nBut layers are gonna be you're friend. Get big sizes so you can have t shirt, hoodie, and a fleece on all at once under your bigass jacket. \n\nNo matter what you do the fall will suck for you but you're body acclimates to the cold and 45 in fall is horrible but 45 in spring has people out in shorts.  Also I'd add get some thick smart wool socks they're amazing, and maybe something called yak tracks which go over your boots and make it much easier to walk on ice. Definitely saved me once I was having to walk up the hill when theyre inconsistent about salting and sanding. \n\nIf you're asking more what the fashion is fuck if I know maybe someone else can help. But there's a pretty functional set to start you off. \n\nOh and I know long underwear isn't sexy but it's fucking amazing. Get a set.",

            "comment": "Not really. This happens a lot. When a small college makes a long-distance appearance in some tournament which Colgate rarely does, the expense and difficulty of shipping an entire band to that location is a bit absurd. All they do is play pep songs. What is the point? So it's not at all unusual to rent some musicians, put them in university shirts, and bingo! You have a stupid pep band. Why would anyone care at all about something this trivial? Especially since it saved a lot of money. You do want your university spending its money on scholarships rather than sending the band somewhere, don't you? I think it's smart and clever, not \"disgraceful\" which is a massive over-reaction to a minor and rather clever thing.",

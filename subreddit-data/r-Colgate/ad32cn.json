            "comment": "It's about as diverse as most small liberal arts colleges that are in small towns or rural areas. In other words, more than you might think, but not as much as you might like. Larger schools, urban schools, and state schools often have the most diverse student bodies. Once upon a time, Colgate was nearly all white (and all male) like a lot of similar schools. But it's now coed (with more women than men), and it has a significant number of Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and others, totaling more than 20% of students, along with maybe 15% of students being foreign. Colgate also has a much more diverse faculty than when I went there decades ago when the faculty was mainly white males. Like me. Not anymore. But this true in most places, so hardly surprising. \n\nIn addition, issues that once seemed big deals at such many schools, gender issues, homosexuality and so on, aren't anymore for most students. But remember that at any college or university you get all types of people, some from small towns, rural areas, and some from intolerant backgrounds along with everyone else. It's not going to be the university's fault if you run into an idiot who makes a remark or behaves poorly. That can and will happen anywhere. People who expect their university to create a comfy environment where no prejudice exists and where everyone loves and respects them all the time are living in a fantasy world. Ain't going to happen anywhere. \n\nColgate's biggest \"fact of life\" is it's rural small town environment which is pretty enough, but a long way from anything resembling \"urban\". You go to Colgate to be at college with your classmates and friends and to study hard and get a good education. You will likely also play sports or be involved in other activities. You can be very busy even in an area miles from cities, and I think it helps form better friendships. That's true whoever you are and whatever background you have. The campus itself is drop-dead gorgeous, the quality of academics is outstanding, equal to or better than many larger, more famous schools . . . and so on. \n\nMy daughter just graduated from Colgate a few years ago and she had friends from different backgrounds and lived with two best friends for two years, one Black, the other Chinese. I'm not sure that proves anything, but there you have it. Five years after graduating they're still good friends so these aren't just \"friendships of convenience.\" On the other hand, most of her friends were white since the university is 75% white. She's mixed race Asian and white, now works in a start-up in San Francisco, and is doing really well . . . thank you for asking. \n\nShe went to high school in Los Angeles where the mix of students was well more diverse than any small rural college is likely to be, maybe 40% non-white. Three students from her high school went to Colgate the same year she was accepted, one Hispanic, the other Black. Plus her. None of this proves much, of course. But these are small snapshots of what you'll find. Of course, the rest of the country is not Los \u0010Angeles, believe me, and Colgate is not NYU or UCLA where the diversity levels will be far higher, no doubt. It's a top quality, small rural college a lot like other such schools in the make-up of its student body -- mostly white people. \n\nIf you come from some very diverse parts of the country like Los Angeles, Colgate will seem pretty white to you and a bit traditional. But whenever I travel to the East Coast or Seattle or most other parts of this country, I have the exact same feeling about these other places -- \"Everyone's white here. Why are people so old-fashioned?\"\nOn the  other hand, if you come from less diverse places, some smaller town, a rural area maybe, it will seem more diverse than you're used to. \n\nThis is off the university's website:\n\nStudents 2,982 students (total)\n\n45% male / 55% female\n\n24% from New York State\n\n22% domestic students of color\n\n10% first-generation college students\n\n16% international students (including dual citizens)\n\nSimilarly, the website claims 24% of faculty of color. \n\n\nSorry to be so windy! I know it's a big decision. But you'll make the right choice. Hint: It's the one you liked best. Good luck wherever you go! \n\n",

It's a big decision and there is still a lot to think about (Haven't visited yet, so I still need to get a feeling of the place). Anyway, I know that it is what you make of it and I'll sure as hell will take advantage of my college years :D",

If you\u2019re not white though the unfortunate reality is the school can be isolating unless you\u2019re extroverted. Message me if have any questions at all, love to answer them.",

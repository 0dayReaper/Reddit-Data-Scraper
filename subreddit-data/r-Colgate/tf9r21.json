    "postText": "As the title says, I am considering transferring from RPI. I am currently a sophomore computer science major, and I am considering transferring to a more diverse, less tech-focused and nerdy, school. I consider myself pretty social, and at RPI I have had a difficult time finding friends that are not focused on just playing video games 24/7 and would love to go to a sports game or just chill. I also think I am a pretty good student; I have a 3.83 gpa and participate in some clubs and organizations on campus. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone had any advice on this potential switch and how my student experience would change if I attended Colgate. I'm already used to doing pretty much nothing on the weekends in Troy (lol) and having a heavy workload, but how is the student life dynamic on campus? I also am aware that the computer science program at RPI ranks a bit higher, but have any CS majors had any issue with the program/internship or co-op opportunities?\n\nTime is moving very fast in my college journey, and I would really rather be happy at a different place for my last 2 years than muddle my way through and get it over with. Any input is greatly appreciated, and thanks for reading this.",

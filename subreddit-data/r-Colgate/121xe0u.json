I\u2019m sure the Colgate environment will be accepting but it won\u2019t necessarily be diverse compared to more urban metros. Likely a more east coast and prep school vibe. It\u2019s a beautiful school and excellent academics. Worth a visit.",

Not that people are outwardly racist or create this segregation on purpose, but it\u2019s most likely because people of color don\u2019t find a sense of comfort within the whole student body and prefer to be with people who can relate to their struggles white attending a PWI. basically as a POC you will either end up having only POC friends, or only white friends. Never lived in a place with such a lack of diversity before but also depends where your son lives now and what he\u2019s used to.",

Either way, I think (hope) he will be more than fine - where I was going is what one of the folks just mentioned. I hear the school has an east coast vibe and a large majority of kids come from privilege. My son will be an incoming freshman and is excited - we are from the west coast and he attends a small parochial high school (although we are Jewish). We are white so can\u2019t speak out of my lane on the African American experience. There is a Black Student Union in case that is a resource to dig a bit further.",

Colgate will feel different given it\u2019s a small liberal arts college (the only one on the list of other schools). It\u2019s on the slightly larger side at 3,200 students but still small compared to his other schools and surrounding towns. My kid loved it\u2026others will think it\u2019s too remote and small. The upside of the SLAC experience is the class size will be much smaller and more personal which fits what my son wanted. Best of luck on the other schools.",

    "postText": "So I just recently got accepted to Colgate, and I'm super excited about it!!! I really want to commit, but I'm having a little trouble with the financial aspect (I got into SUNY Geneseo for only $5,000 per semester, and Colgate will be almost twice that). So I had a few questions about housing that I'm hoping will make me feel a littleee better about the finances.\n\n1.) Do the different types of housing (suites, singles, doubles, triples) have different costs? If so, what's the cheapest possible option (and, if you happen to know, what's the price?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) Is the housing lottery the only possible option to move off campus?  Like, if I got denied for the housing lottery would I have to stay on campus?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the help guys! Hope I'll see you next year :)",

Personally as someone who decided between Colgate and Geneseo the increase cost seemed worth it. Colgate opened a lot of doors for me that I dont think a suny state school will. Feel free to dm me if you have more questions",

At that point you can choose to live in a social house that\u2019s a part of your commons, join study groups like SRS which has its own house, or stay on campus for another year. Juniors and Seniors tend to live down the hill at apartments, townhouses, or frat/soro houses. If you have any other questions feel free to PM!",

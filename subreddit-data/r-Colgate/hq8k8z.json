However, I just look at the reviews on niche website and found out that most people are discouraging international student to go there because the community is not friendly towards us. Also, people mentioned that there are systemic alchemy, excessive drug use, sexual assaults in this school which makes me worry. Can anyone tell me the truth bcs I just really wanna find a good university that suits me the best. Thanks :D",

            "comment": "This is a \"work hard play hard\" culture, in which certain nights most people are partying and certain nights almost everyone is doing their work. The professors are incredibly accessible and scholarly in their fields, so unlike bigger places like Cornell down the road, you are not taught by graduate students and might find yourself at dinner at your professor's home. You can easily make your own world, with your own friends, or you can be part of the larger culture that was founded on that distinct flavor of fraternity life. It's overall a friendly place, with a few bad apples who get worse with alcohol added.",

Every private school in the US has the problems you listed - some more than others - and I feel like Colgate is not much different. In fact, the office of international students and the international community at Colgate in general is very supportive in my opinion. Also, there are a lot of Chinese students here (almost half internationals are Chinese) so the Chinese community over here is also very tight. \n\nThere have been some racially motivated hate crimes on campus in the past few years, especially one against Chinese people about 2 years ago. Alcohol usage is also very excessive, but I haven\u2019t experienced peer pressure personally so it totally depends on the type of people you hang out with. Lmk if you have any more questions.",

            "comment": "I'd be careful about the information on websites like Niche and others. Often they tend to attract people with a grievance. Most people who are happy about anything don't post comments. If 5% of students feel unhappy, they're the ones most likely to comment. So I'm not really sure what I see on a lot of such websites is really accurate. I certainly wouldn't dismiss any reliable information but be sure to find out more about the school from other sources, alumni, and so on. \n\nBeing Chinese at Colgate is not going to be a problem. Large urban schools are easier places for Asian students because more Asians live in cities, and so on. There's not much anyone can do about that. Colgate has a small student body (about 3K). How many are Asian or specifically Chinese? One website says 4%. Colgate's own website says more like 9%. A lot of websites use old data, so you can't really be sure. The Admissions Office can give you a much more accurate number. \n\nColgate uses the standard category \"Asian and Pacific Islander\" to get its 9%. Still, 9% is a couple hundred Asian students. If that's not good enough, I guess you'd need to go elsewhere. With small colleges, it's always a concern with any group, Jews, African-Americans, maybe Norwegians, too. There are never \"enough\". So most people don't make an issue of who you are or where you came from. You just make friends and hang out with the people you like the way you'd do anywhere. Most students you won't have any relationship with at all. \n\nYou say \"most people\" are discouraging international students going to Colgate. Who are these \"most\" people? Is it two or three people who posted something? What specifically are they referring to? When I attended Colgate years ago, and when my daughter attended just a few years back, there were no incidents, but maybe there have been some. I'd find out more and find out what Colgate did about it. I mean, if some jerk said something racist and got himself expelled, that's what you'd want to hear. \n\nOne of my daughter's roommates for two years was Chinese-American (parents were Chinese, but she'd grown up in the U.S.) and the other was Black. She's Japanese-American, but pretty white looking. She had friends who were white, black, Asian. I don't think any of them had any problem. If some people are racist, what are you going to do? Stay away from them. \n\nAs for the usual fears of too much drinking and drug use, there are just about zero colleges where that doesn't happen. A lot of people will drink. It can be annoying, it's true, but I had no trouble decades ago. I just didn't drink. No one forces you to drink or do drugs.  College students drink too much. And they do drugs too much. No doubt about it. Colgate is more isolated than urban and suburban schools, so there aren't as many distractions. That's good for studying and talking to professors and focusing, and the campus is drop-dead gorgeous, but for some people who get bored easily it's not so good for their alcohol and drug use. \n\nSexual assaults? I've never heard that Colgate has more of a problem than other universities, and neither my daughter or me knew of anything more than some random stupid behavior from a few people from time to time. That happens everywhere just like alcohol, and it's much less tolerated. \n\nYou're worried that Colgate has an anti-Asian problem, doesn't like international students, and has a drug, alcohol, and sex problem. It's easy to hear a few comments and imagine they're typical. These problems do exist, but they're at nearly every other college. Bigger schools will have even more problems. At a small school, you figure out pretty quickly who you can trust and who is a problem. You could walk all over campus and all over town for four years and never have a single problem with anyone. It's about the safest place you'll ever be. Except for the cows. Watch out for the cows. \n\nColgate University has very high academic quality and is very well respected. But if you're looking for a college with many Chinese students, little to no alcohol or drug use, and so on, I have no idea where that college would be. Colgate is a fabulous school, but it's real life, too, with all the usual issues. Fortunately, the professors are very good, the students are very bright, they work hard and to blow off steam they play hard, and the result is smart normal people who get very good educations. Three of my roommates at Colgate went to med school and became doctors or medical scientists, one went to Harvard Law School and became a top lawyer, one became an anthropologist, one a minister, a couple whose names you'd recognize became journalists. These are smart people.  It's hard to find much wrong with that.",

And I can tell you I didn\u2019t have a good experience at all, it really affected how I think about myself. Before I saw those comments on niche, I really love Colgate just by looking at the website, the class size, the environment, everything just seems so perfect there. I just don\u2019t want to experience what I\u2019ve been through in high school again and I\u2019ve never been to the US so I just want to be more careful when picking the right school to avoid the same mistake. And the info that you are telling me now is extremely useful and I really appreciate that :D",

Her short freshman year was, as far as I know and see from my daughter's busy schedule school and social life, very fulfilling and rewarding for her. She easily gained a few close friends, and more than a handful are international students. In fact, two of the IS are still on campus staying longterm due to the pandemic. She really enjoyed it there. The curriculum is very good, professors and support staff are great. She enjoyed the small class sizes. There's plenty of activities for the students every week that you can take part of or just chill on your own. The campus is very beautiful. And like Drew said, the university is no different from other colleges where there will be alcohol and drug use. There are also a few racist occurrence the past year or so but the school was proactive about dealing with this issue. I have not heard any sexual assault cases on campus. Overall our first year with Colgate has been very positive. By the way, we are US citizens of Asian descent.",

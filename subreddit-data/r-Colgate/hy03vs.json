            "comment": "I mean, how prestigious a school is considered is really in the eye of the beholder, no? I\u2019m a Colgate alum living in NYC, and while my Colgate degree was extremely helpful for landing my first job out of school (which I would argue is the most important advantage of attending a \u201cprestigious\u201d school), it doesn\u2019t turn heads the way saying you went to an Ivy League school does. I would argue this is a good thing, though, because I\u2019d rather be judged on my character and achievements since graduating than have people view something I achieved when I was basically still a child as the most important thing about me.\n\nThat being said, Colgate is a great school that provides students with a high quality education and extensive networking opportunities. I personally enjoyed my time at Colgate and would recommend it to others. If you really want the numbers, the statistics that the Admission Office provides and the rankings published by the Princeton Review / US News &amp; World speak for themselves.",

            "comment": "When my daughter was applying for schools, she wanted to stay in-state. I let her do her research about schools she\u2019s interested in. When she got in to 7+1 waitlist out 9 schools, it\u2019s was just a matter of narrowing it down to where she can achieve her potential and where she can grow. And to be honest, finances is also a big factor. We are so unfamiliar with how the American college system works especially the money aspect of affordability. It was a battle (as parents) between sending her to our local cc first or SUNY schools (we have great ones) or to a private school. Putting everything in a spreadsheet to compare all her FAs was eye opening to see and learn how expensive college education here in the US. The next step was how she feels about student population. We visited 3 campuses two of them large ones and one LAC with a smaller population. She fell in love with Colgate! She said to me, \u201cMom, I see myself growing here.\u201d So it was then settled. \n\nOne of the many things I like about the school while doing my own research was the extensive networking and support most alumni give each other. So I thought our daughter is not only getting a great education but also  is being given lots of opportunities to explore her strength so she can reach her goals for her future. She belongs to Class of 2023.",

Our out of pocket expenses is the lowest with Colgate and equal to the two SUNY schools the rest are 3-4K higher even with presidential scholarship and grants. Colgate\u2019s cost of attendance is the highest of all the schools she applied to but gave her the best FA. Beginning this school year Colgate eliminated the federal loans increasing grants to students who are eligible. If the 55K is your parents combined income I say you will most likely get a decent FA. Our combined household is a little bit more than yours but less than the 125K eligibility set by the school. Look into the school\u2019s site for more informing aid.",

This year it\u2019s a bit lower bec she is an RA or CL as they call it at the school. She gets paid with free housing so we only pay her gold plan meal which is required for all freshmen and sophomores.",

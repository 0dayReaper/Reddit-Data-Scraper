    "postText": "Hey there Colgate community, just wanted to put it out there that at least two students have confirmed tested positive for the virus so far, and according to anecdotes I\u2019ve heard from classmates there\u2019s likely a dozen or more that are showing symptoms but won\u2019t be tested due to their age and the shortage of tests available. The second positive test result proves that it was spreading while everyone was on campus the week before break, as the second person had not left campus for multiple weeks before returning home, and began showing symptoms just a few days after getting back. Please stay safe, practice social distancing, and remember that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re carrying it or not right now.\n\nI\u2019m not school administration so I most likely don\u2019t have all the answers to any questions about this, but I wanted to make this info available to everyone.",

                    "comment": "The virus was spreading in Hamilton for at least the week before everyone was scheduled to start spring break, like this post makes clear. Before we were given the news that we were being sent home for the semester, we were told by administration to shelter in place on campus over break, which led to a huge amount of confusion leading into break. Then a few days later, we were given the news that campus was closing and everyone needed to leave.\n\nSome students chose to stick around the town for a few days before leaving to party, which the rest of the student body condemned as irresponsible and reprehensible. However, the actions of the hundred or so students who chose to do this is far from representative of the entire campus. Calling Colgate students as a whole \u201cyou fucks\u201d and blaming us as a whole for the spread of the virus in the 13346 area code is reactionary and doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the situation as a whole.\n\nBeing both a native of CNY and a Colgate student, I can see where the greater community\u2019s frustration with the actions of some people in the student body comes from. But saying \u201cdon\u2019t come back\u201d to 3,000 students at a university that contributes greatly to the local economy is silly.",

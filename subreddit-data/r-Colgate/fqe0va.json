            "comment": "First/OUS is a pretty great program from my experience. Last year OUS kids showed up a few months earlier and took a few classes before returning home a few weeks before school to get a head-start on coursework. You also have to go through your own pre-orientation before the regular student orientation, which will kinda feel like hell I\u2019m not going to lie; lots of meetings and just introducing yourself over and over again but you will survive. This gives you alot of time to find some pretty good friends before everyone else moves on campus, you also get free textbooks and your own space at the OUS house on campus that has board games, a TV, XBOX and a kitchen. Also if you ever need financial support the program is able to give you money to help with transport, materials for classes etc. There aren\u2019t many things you are REQUIRED to do for the program, the leaders just ask that you occasionally check in and the program hosts events where they bring in food from out of town (which you will want after a few months of only eating colgate food) and other little \u201cfamily gatherings\u201d. Overall its a really great opportunity and does end up feeling sort of like a family after the first couple weeks. After your initial few months though it wont play a huge role in your day to day goings on though.",

However at the start of each term we send one of the program leaders what books we need and he gets them for us. So its probably safe to assume you will be given them for the summer as well.",

In the beginning of each semester, you'll get a form from our coordinators where you tell them the courses you'll be taking and the books you'll need. Getting all your books for the semester is not guaranteed, but in my experience, they've always gotten me all my books. At the end of the semester, you just have to give them back! Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any other questions, too!",

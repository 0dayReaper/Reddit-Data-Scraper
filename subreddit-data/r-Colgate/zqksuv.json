            "comment": "I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to confirm this 100% - it isn\u2019t like the admissions department is going to jump into this thread and admit to it - but it seems unlikely that the cause for rejections is an anti-Egyptian bias.\n\nFirst thing that pops into my mind is a reporting bias, where negative news propagates more easily than positive news - if you did indeed hear of 9 or 10 students being rejected ED1, I\u2019d be curious if news of rejections spreads more widely than the news of the 1 person who was (statistically speaking) accepted.  Remember, Colgate has something along the lines of a 12% acceptance rate these days, so for those 9 rejections you wouldn\u2019t expect more than 1 acceptance really, and that\u2019s ignoring all the other factors that influence those overall figures.\n\nSecond thing that comes to my mind is the anecdotal nature of these 9 or 10 rejections.  If you happen to have heard of them then they come from a narrow network near you.  They aren\u2019t a simple random sample of applicants spread out among your country.  Which means they likely were applying from similar backgrounds, having attended similar schools, being advised by similar advisors, etc.  Which increases the likelihood of a rejectable quality found in one of those applicants also being found in the others - perhaps their grades were similar, or their schools weren\u2019t competitive enough, or their applications were given the same ill-advice from a low-quality advisor.\n\nI suppose it is entirely possible that there are geopolitical reasons that make it more difficult to accept, sponsor, and provide student visas for students from Egypt, but I don\u2019t know either way and even if there were, all US schools would face the same difficulties in that regard.  Really, I think Occam\u2019s razor is correct here, and the most likely reason students may have been rejected would be for academic and pragmatic reasons, and not for underlying biases.\n\nAll that said, apply if you\u2019re interested in the school.  Do what you can to put your best foot forward - perhaps there\u2019s a way you can have a video call with someone in admissions to make a more personal application - but don\u2019t not apply just because you think there may be more sinister biases at work.  That seems like something that can only harm you in the end.",

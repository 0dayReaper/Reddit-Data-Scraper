    "postText": "Hi! I'm an international applicant looking to apply to Colgate, I had a couple questions I was hoping people could answer. Any info is appreciated!\n\n1. I'd be applying as a Comp Sci major. How good is the university at internships and job placements, also for international students.\n2. Are there a lot of international students and diversity?\n3. I'd be applying for financial aid, but they don't mention how much of it would be loans. Do internationals receive scholarships? What's the max. amount?\n4. Can you work on-campus? Does this make a significant amount of money?\n5. Do IB credits transfer?\n6. Can you graduate a year early?\n7. Anything else you want to tell me about the school?\n\nAlso my stats are\n\nSAT - 1530\n\nIB score - predicted 40 - Math phy chem hl\n\nI'll be taking my subject tests this october in math 2 and physics and hopefully do well",

            "comment": "Colgate grad here, and my daughter recently graduated from Colgate, as well (as did my father): \n\n1. Pretty good with internships, though neither my daughter nor I had financial aid or a campus job (but it sure cost a lot of money!). As for job placement after graduation, it does very well indeed. Colgate has just finished building an entire new (beautiful) building on campus dedicated to job placement for its graduates. You might ask the Admissions people about this. It's pretty impressive. Most colleges tuck 'job placement' into a building somewhere you don't even know exists. Colgate features it. \n\n2. Not a lot of international students by pure numbers. A couple hundred? Not sure. It's a small university (&lt;3000 students), but there are still quite a few non-American students at Colgate. Even many decades ago, I knew a few international students (one guy from India, another from the Czech Republic, a few Chinese students, etc.), and my daughter did as well. Since then, Colgate has made efforts to look for more students from outside the U.S.. Look at the university website which has that information (check \"Admissions\"). Or just call Admissions and they can tell you. They'll be happy to answer all your questions. \n\n3. About financial aid, call Admissions or the Financial Aid office (or email, of course). Most of my friends were on some kind of financial aid. Some did work-study, some just got loans. Yes, international student get scholarships and loans. It's possible to get full tuition remission if you're particularly extraordinary, but not likely. Partial tuition remission is very common, though. Ask them. We did not apply for financial aid for my daughter for various reasons -- so it cost us a ton of money. No vacations and no new car for a long time! \n\n4. Yes, on-campus work is very common. Most people I knew worked at least a few hours a week, maybe more than that. Again, ask Admissions for Financial Aid. They have all the answers that some random guy who went to Colgate wouldn't know very wel. \n\n5. If you mean do you get high school IB or AP credit transferred for college credit, it's generally up to the particular academic department at a college or university to decide, not the university. I know many departments accept AP exam scores of \"5\" for course credit, but some don't. Some want you to take their courses only. And IB is less common in the U.\u0010S. so it may have different rules. Once again, ask Admissions.  They'll know. They're been asked all these questions hundreds of times. Or email. Or you might look at the university catalog which has each department's credit policy in it somewhere. But the easy-schmeezy way to do it would be to call the department directly and ask. They'll now for sure. \n\n6. Some people graduate early, but certainly not very many. My father went to Colgate, and he graduated in only three years -- but that was during World War II! They needed more soldiers and sailors so they were pushing peopl to graduate early. So, yes, it's been done before.  Today, I don't know. It's a very challenging curriculum. Doing your degree in only three years would be pretty hard (I barely finished in 4 years!). And it would take summer courses, not necessarily taken at Colgate but transferred (with Colgate's permission, of course) from another school. I did two courses at another college one summer and they transferred to Colgate with no problem. I got permission to first, of course, and after being at Colgate those two courses were so easy I couldn't believe it. \n\n7. It's a fabulous university for what it is. This is not an urban school or a large university. It's in a very small town in the middle of nowhere, but it's also a very pretty area. If you like rolling hills and trees and farms! The campus itself is drop-dead gorgeous, like a picture postcard of a \"college\" or something out of a movie. I never got tired of just looking at the campus, and when I was feeling depressed it cheered me up to be on such a beautiful campus. \n\nIn a small town, there's not much to do except study, get together with friends, see a movie, play sports, and so on. I found it relaxing and enjoyable. People who need lots of urban stimulation, noise, and distraction wouldn't enjoy it, I imagine. Being in a beautiful place for four years and studying hard and making good friends -- without a lot of other distractions -- appealed to me, but my first year I did find it hard to adjust since I came from the New York City suburbs. If you're from Tokyo, Rio, Prague, Shanghai, or London, get ready for a big change! \n\nAcademic quality is very high, among the best in the country, though Comp Sci is a department I'm not familiar with. I'm sure MIT and Caltech, etc. are even better. My kind of course work (art, history, English, etc) was first-rate and very challenging. My daughter majored in Political Science. Colgate has made a major effort to improve its science programs and its technology/computer science program. Colgate also has a 'core curriculum' with a group of required courses every student must take. This helps unify each class of students, but more importantly it assures that every graduate has a good basic education in general knowledge subjects -- unlike many universities where you can graduate knowing very little about most things.\n\nStudents are of all races and backgrounds, from all 50 U.S. states and various foreign countries. My daughter's two best friends were an Asian-American girls and an African-American girl, so not international students exactly. I've heard people say Colgate is very white, but I don't think that's any more true than on any rural, small college, and less than many. Colgate students tend to be mostly middle-class (and upper class), often have cars on campus, and the \"look\" is pretty preppy, well-scrubbed, and a bit like a clothing ad, I always thought. Not that I looked like that! I always needed a hair cut. Colgate students seem really physically fit as a large number play some kind of sports, either on full-fledged teams or intramural sports. These are healthy-looking students for the most part. My daughter played club rugby (she's only 5'0\" tall!). I played no sports, but was embarrassed enough about it to work out in the athletic center a lot! (You've been warned!!) \n\nTransportation to Hamilton, NY is a concern. We live in Los Angeles, and my daughter needed to fly from LAX to Chicago or Cleveland and change planes to fly to Syracuse, NY. It took a full day of travel each way. From the Syracuse airport, she took the \"Colgate Cruiser,\" a university-run shuttle bus from Syracuse Airport (called Hancock Airport?) one hour south to Hamilton, NY. Or you would just take an Uber/Lyft. It's not hard to do, but depending on wherever home is, you'll first need to fly to a large city and change planes to get to Syracuse.  This is pretty common with college students who go to college far from home, especially if they attend a small liberal arts college in the countryside somewhere, so not really a big deal but something to be aware of. \n\nYour scores are impressive. Good for you, Mr. Smarty Pants! I was a humanities and social sciences student, but most of my friends were pre-meds who became doctors (of course) so the science programs even decades ago were excellent. Plus a few pre-lawyers. A few became professors or teachers. A few went into medical sciences. Computers hadn't been invented then! There are a number of new science buildings on campus, and they're very impressive. Colgate produces lots of doctors, lawyer, educators (like me) and business people. It's highly respected both by employers and graduate schools. So have no fear about its benefit to you. \n\nGood luck! Hope you get admitted to all the schools you're applying to.",

            "comment": "I am an international student but I am not a comp sci major.\n\n1. You get lots of opportunities to talk to people in different fields and the career center is really helpful in interviews, resumes, and all that. All of these are presented to students but it is up TO YOU to make use of these resources and start finding jobs and stuff. Noone forces you to attend these things. I don't suppose you are interested in research which is something I am interested in but tons of research positions are only for domestic students. Colgate btw has a more theoretical approach to comp sci.    \n\nMy brother who is a comp sci major interning rn in Facebook did not study in colgate but he applied to many places which said stuff like we would gladly accept you if you were domestic but having to get all the paperwork done was too much for many companies. He did have to work extra hard as an international but he did get good paid internships both sophomore summer and junior summer \n\n2) Diversity can be difficult at times but you find your niche at colgate easily. There  are around 10 - 15% international students who I guarantee will be friendly to you no matter which are country ypu are from. The international student orientation is led by upperclassmen of international background while you also meet others. There are only around 150 of you guys in your own year and you all form a really close bond despite it being orientation. However the real orientation after that makes you realise the vast differences you may have with others. \n\nI definitely have domestic students as friends and don't get me wrong they are definitely friendly and don't mean anything wrong. I just wish they took more initiative to connect with us. Usually we have to take the extra step to do that and that can be exhausting to do if you are doing it to dozens of people. It can feel alienating and scary at times but it's easy to find a group of people who will be friendly to you.\n\n3) I believe colgate recently removed loans from their aid and only give aid in the form of grants and work-study. Aid is dependent on financial need and some of my friends are on near 95-99% scholarship. I am on a 75% scholarship. You don't get much opportunity to get more money after the need based aid.\n\n4) As an international you are legally allowed to work up to 20 hours a week during the school year and jobs give around 11-13 $ per hour. I don't believe that restriction applies during summer and winter break. Some jobs are reserved for internationals and it's not hard to find employment here.\n\n5) you may need to apply for it: https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-services-and-resources/transfer-and-pre-matriculation-credit\n\n6) You can.",

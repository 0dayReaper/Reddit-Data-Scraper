    "postText": "Hello! I'm a prospective International student from Asia.\n\nMy family's ability to pay is very limited. Is an estimated EFC of $2500 very low to be considered for admission? (As an International) I'm gonna apply for RD.\nAre there current international students who had EFC as low as mine? (If you don't mind sharing)\n\nI have taken 3 SAT subject tests (Math 2 - 800, Chemistry - 800, Physics - 770). How much may it help in the admission process? \n\nIt will be really helpful if someone can give me some Insights. And please feel free to drop any additional suggestions about admission as an International. (Especially the essay!!)",

Yes, there are wealthy kids everywhere but we are from a very poor family, as poor as they come and I don\u2019t ever feel out of place. People on this campus are the friendliest and chillest and no one cares how much wealth you come from. I\u2019m thriving there, paid zero dollars for my time here. Completely free ride and my sister will be given the same aid. Couldn\u2019t be happier here.",

As for the population question it is mostly rich kids but there\u2019s some still others mixed in but I can confidently say the majority of the students here are extremely wealthy.",

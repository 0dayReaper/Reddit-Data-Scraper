    "postText": "Hey guys so I was just wondering if it would be worth it to have a car while in college. I\u2019m coming next fall and the only reason I would go off campus during the semester would be weekend trips to some mountains or Boston or New York or something like that. I don\u2019t know if I should just get a car or use the zipcar service. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Either way you'll be fine. I had a car when I was at Colgate decades ago, but most of my friends did not. It was helpful to visit friends at other colleges as well as to drive to Colgate and home again for vacations. It was also helpful to do errands, though it was not really necessary.\n\nMy daughter who graduated from Colgate in 2013 did not have a car for her first three years there and was fine. When she needed a ride, she either took the Colgate Cruiser bus or went in a friend's car. But in her Senior year she really, really wanted a car on campus, so we shipped her one long distance. I'm not sure she used it much, but she did one or two trips. \n\nSo I'd say it's helpful, but not entirely necessary. If you do get a car, be sure it's good in snow!",

Of course not everyone has one and they get by just fine, but I do use mine all the time.",

I\u2019d say it\u2019s useful to take trips because the grocery store is a little far (but there\u2019s always the cruiser, but it can be a bit inconvenient at times). I\u2019d say because of COVID, it\u2019s a little less useful but after this passes over it will be very useful to travel to Syracuse/ Utica on the weekend. It\u2019s up to you I\u2019d say",

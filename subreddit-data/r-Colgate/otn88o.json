It's kinda on the outskirts of campus, but for the most part, everything is about a 5-10 minute walk.  Your main places to get food will be Donovans pub and frank dining hall. I don't know if they will change it this year, but last year there was a chipotle style Mexican place in the main area of Bryan complex, but it's only open during lunch hours. If you have any other questions just dm me and ill be happy to help. Looking forward to seeing you at Colgate!",

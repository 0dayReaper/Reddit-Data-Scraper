    "postText": "Hi! I will be applying to Colgate as an international applicant. I just had a few questions about the college before applying.\n\n1. I require a lot of financial aid. How is the financial aid for international students at Colgate?\n2. I will be applying as a CS major.  I am also looking forward to studying Economics. How is the CS and Econ major at Colgate? What are the internship opportunities, job placements, and grad school placements like?\n3. What are the best and worst things about Colgate?\n\nThank you!",

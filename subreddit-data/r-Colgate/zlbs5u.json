Look, kid, there are a hundred or more \"top\" colleges around the country, and some of them you will get into and love going to.\n\nColgate admits 12% of its applicants (about 21,000 spply) for a first year class size of about 800 students -- which means thousands of completely qualified students have to be turned down every year. You may be one of those completely qualified applicants they had no room for. If they accepted all their qualified applicants, they'd have 3,000 or 4,000 students showing up for dorms and meals and classes that can only accommodate 800 people. That won't work. Not getting admitted often does not mean \"not qualified,\" but may just mean \"no more room\". It's like trying to buy a ticket to a sold-out show. Or when a really top restaurant can't take your reservation because they're completely booked. It doesn't mean they don't like you. You'll be fine.",

            "comment": "The focus today on \"stress\" repeatedly and apparently endlessly seems to me to be based on a slightly misguided assumption that today students experience far more stress than students ever did. Hmmm . . . where's the data supporting that idea? I don't know of any other than anecdotal examples, and honestly all students, particulary the ones at top colleges and universities, are under a lot of stress a lot of the time. But it's worth noting, they chose to be under that stress for the greater rewards and benefits it provides them. Graduating from a well-respected (ie. tough) college confers status and opportunities. In the current era, the belief that students are under much greater stress seems to be one of those unquestioned assumptions someone ought to question. Under too much stress? I have a solution. Enroll at any of hundreds of schools where there is little stress. Anyone can solve their stress problem if they do that. What students really want, I'd imagine, is all the benefits of a top-college education but without the stress. Sorry, that is not going to happen.",

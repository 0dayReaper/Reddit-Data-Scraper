Unless they've moved out of Wynn or redone the labs they were kinda old but had some good equipment in them though.  Had some friends who were chem majors all crazy smart never any major complaints and the profs were generally well liked.  They do take a bunch of students to DC to work at the CDC for a semester which is pretty impressive and good at building connections/experience. \n\nI do think though that for as tough as Colgate can be to get into, there's more prestigious chem programs out there. If you like Colgate for other reasons I think you'll do fine but, if you're just looking for the best chem program you can get with your stats there may be better schools out there. \n\nBut open to any current students to say different, they've been trying to improve all their sciences for years.",

            "comment": "I am a current Chem student here. I have grown to really like the department. I am one of sub-10 pure chemistry majors in the department: The vast majority are biochem, and many if not most of those are pre-med. It\u2019s hard to say much about admissions as a student, but it\u2019s possible that they are interested in balancing the chem/biochem ratio and would therefore be interested in someone who expressed interest in that.\n\nOn its face, Colgate is definitely geared towards the humanities, so if you\u2019re looking for a prestigious program, there are definitely better options. However the really nice thing about Colgate is that we don\u2019t have any graduate programs in science, so there are a ton of opportunities for research as an undergrad. If that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in, I would recommend looking through some of the faculty pages to see if any of the research here sounds interesting. There\u2019s a high chance you would be able to get on to pretty much any project, especially if you express interest early. And noting that in your application would probably make you stand out as well.\n\nI hope that was helpful and let me know if you have any more questions!",

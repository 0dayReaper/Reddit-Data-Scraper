People are always up to getting drunk in the woods but you have to remember the weather is awful (camping-wise) for most of the normal school year. You may find like minded people at Outdoor Ed but gear is so cheap to rent there that it might be a better option.",

Renting from Outdoor Ed should be able to suit your needs, and then you don't have to deal with the care/storage of a bunch of equipment.",

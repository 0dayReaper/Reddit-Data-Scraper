I know there is excellent placement, I guess I will need to go to graduate school\u2026 just curious if anyone else had this experience.",

            "comment": "Not sure what the specific question you\u2019re asking is but I suspect you\u2019re trying to figure out how a liberal arts education fits into specific career goals when there aren\u2019t classes being taught on marketing or organizational behavior, etc. Most students that go into business learn on the job rather than going to grad school right out of college. You do internships, network and land your first job in the field you think you\u2019re interested in and go from there. For marketing that may mean joining the marketing organization of a large (S&amp;P 500) firm that hired college grads and trains them on the job. Yes, sometimes specific skills or classes in a college with more pre-professional majors (like undergrad business schools) can help\u2026but ultimately employers look for raw smarts, maturity, social intelligence and good attitudes. Pretty certain Colgate career services can help here. Graduate business schools become good options a few years after college for the top programs.",

            "comment": "My daughter graduated from Colgate a couple of years ago, and I went to Colgate in the Dark Ages when it was all-male. Today, Colgate is pretty much in the mainstream of gender, racial, and other issues with the usual, but only occasional incident, more likely about race than anything else. Pretty standard college stuff today when you bring a couple thousand people together from many different places, some of them being a bit bigoted or maybe just clueless and unsophisticated, at least at the beginning of their college career. \n\nIn my own experience from the 1960s -- yes, ancient history -- I had a couple of friends who were obviously gay (I'm male) but it didn't seem to matter to most people even in that era when everyone kept it a secret. Maybe there some aggressively anti-gay people there back then, but I never saw or heard from them. And of course there were the usual snide jokes among late-adolescent boys unsure of their own sexuality, but that's to be expected most everywhere until people grow up a little. So, even 40 years ago, it might not have been too awful.\n\nIn my freshman year, I had two yahoo roommates who talked only about basketball, basketball, basketball because they played on the team. But in my sophomore year I lived with five other guys, two of whom were gay and the nicest roommates (all of them) you've ever seen. Being gay was of no importance, and in fact I found I liked gay guys a lot better than basketball players because gay people seemed to have better senses of humor and all that. But I don't want to sound like a cliche here. \n\nToday, about 1/3 of Colgate students join a fraternity or sorority, a bit unfortunately I'd say, but it does provide a group of people you can rely on and some social life, so it's not all bad and serves a real purpose when dorm life can be a little isolating for people. In my fraternity way back then, a couple \"brothers\" were gay and nobody cared. This was an era when no one came out until later in life, and many never did due to career worries. So, if you knew or thought someone was gay (never dated girls, etc.) you just didn't mention it. Truly weird compared to today, I know. My fraternity was Phi Kappa Tau (still there) and it was known jokingly as the \"UN\" since we welcomed everyone -- foreigners, athletes, blacks, gays, Jews, whatever else there is, in an era when that was not really very normal. No one cared as long as you were a decent person, friendly and so on, which is all that mattered. And we had the highest GPA on campus every year! Woohoo! No thanks to me, I have to say. Most people were smart and worked hard. Almost everyone I know in my fraternity and just on campus, in general, had a good sense of humor, a smart mind, and couldn't really be bothered with nonsense like being racist or homophobic. I suppose some people were those things, but I honestly never knew any. And making a homophobic (or God forbid, racist) remark was just not something I ever remember anyone doing. Now, jokes about women in an all-male college, were pretty common, but that was mostly because we missed them sooooo much! All the fraternity stereotypes you've ever heard just did not apply. I have no idea if it's still the same fraternity today, and I offer this only as an example of what was possible even a very long time ago. \n\nMy daughter has much more recent experiences with the present university and also had friends who were gay -- in this case girls, perhaps guys, too -- and again no one could have cared any less. It matters about as much as your religion or hair color. No one cares. Unlike the 1960s, Colgate now had organizations and facilities and people in charge of the whole business of racial and gender issues, so you're immediately okay in that respect. \n\nAs for daily life, going to classes, studying, activities, trips, parties, and so on, you'll find the whole spectrum from people who have not the slightest concern over someone's gender orientation to people who are just appalled that someone is homosexual. You're going to find that anywhere, of course, and Colgate isn't any better than anywhere else. There are universities which are known as being extremely accepting of gay students, probably more than Colgate is, but on a daily basis it's just not an issue, and I've seen one ranking (if you even believe all the endless rankings there are) that puts Colgate pretty high in racial-gender, etc. comfort levels. But, everyone's personal experience is really all that matters. \n\nColgate is very, very rural, and cities are going to provide a much wider diversity and more opportunities than a small farm town with a college next to it, so that's worth considering, too. Urban universities tend to have a broader spectrum of students, more variety of activities off campus (obviously), and so on, and that tends to work toward greater tolerance. Or at least you'd think so, but then again racial and gender violence and prejudice happens far more often in those same cities (more people), so who really knows?  Small colleges have a different dynamic, a more cohesive feeling in which you know many more people better than in a more scattered urban university. You see people more often, and the number of people is smaller, so it's a bit more friendly and supportive in many ways than a larger or more urban university would ever be. I think that just makes it harder for someone to be nasty to other people than at a large and more anonymous university. I can't even imagine what it's like to go to a huge university where you don't even know 95% of the other students and you're basically just a number and take mostly lecture classes where the professor hardly even knows you.  Colgate is more intimate, more close, and you do get to know a lot of people pretty well. \n\nSo, I haven't really answered your question. You might check \"College Confidential\" or other college-related websites or just google \"being gay at Colgate University\" to find some helpful links. \nOn CC, someone posted this:\n\n\"Off the top of my head... there's Big Gay Weekend/Drag Ball (an (awesome) annual event), Rainbow Alliance (LGBTQ group), Advocates (gay/straight alliance), speakers on campus (B. D. Wong was there one year), and \"safe-zone training\" that I think everyone in the administration gets, as well as RAs and other students interested. There's a newsletter published... monthly? Semesterly? called \"Out and About\" (more here: Colgate: LGBTQ ) I remember something about Colgate being ranked as among the more gay-friendly schools in some publication...\n\n\"In my experience, people of any orientation were accepted easily, but that may not be true among all groups (mens varsity sports teams come to mind...). Still, there are openly gay students that are at the top of student government and the 2007 winner of the 1819 award (which is a HUGE, huge deal) was out and really involved on campus with LGBTQ issues. Though Colgate has a reputation for being a bit WASPy, there's plenty of students of different backgrounds - and we could always use more!\"\n\nHope that helps a little! Good luck choosing. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "I know this is a late response and you may not read it but I am a current student (senior) and I think I can weight in. You will be hard pressed to find a more tolerant, LGBT friendly, supportive community than here at Colgate. There are so many programs and groups involved in things like Gay rights, sex positivity, and tolerance of all lifestyles. Of course there are douchy men and women who are anti LGBT here (Colgate Republicans) just as there are in any other establishment but I assure you that they are a tiny minority. This culture of social justice is so strong here that if any person publicly derides LGBT initiatives they are socially ostracized and perhaps even the recipient of administrative disciplinary action. We at Colgate are extremely LGBT friendly and if that was your biggest concern I can't recommend this place enough. Side note: I am not in any way LGB or T, and therefore I can't speak on their behalf, so my praise may not be routed in 100% experience. But I promise from what I've seen on this campus, gay people are not only accepted but embraced.",

            "comment": "Mega late, but I wondered if there was a reddit page for this and saw your post and figured I could chime in.\n\nI graduated from Colgate in 2012 and am LGBTQ+ (although at the time I was in Colgate I was heavily involved with the LGBTQ+ and ally group and had many, many friends in the LGBTQ+ only group).  I didn't come out as queer until two years ago, but never thought about doing it at Colgate.\n\nIt's a super small section of the population so the dating scene mega sucks.  Everyone knows everyone, but reach out to Hamilton College's group to do more interaction.  \n\nWe used to go to Syracuse every other Thursday to go gay clubbing because it was the only time to really let loose and not have to worry that someone is side eyeing you from the \"local club\" that everyone goes to (The Jug).  One of them shut down and I cannot remember the name of the other one, but it's heavily gay men focused if that's your jam.  I still had a really fun time dancing with friends as a woman.   \n\nThere are positives for visibility like having Big Gay Weekend which was a two day conference at Colgate and ended in a drag show.  We sent people to LGBTQ+ conferences and brought in speakers.  Had Lavender Graduation.  There were also racial tensions in the group because a lot of it was white queer focused (and specifically white gay men focused) which left others feeling excluded or marginalized.  (But there were racial tensions at Colgate anyway and some very seriously undercurrents at that.)\n\nTwo of my friends came out as trans while at Colgate and there were a lot of bumps in the road for them.  \n\nSomeone mentioned Greek life and there were definitely certain frats that are way more gay friendly than others where you could be openly gay.  Not sure if it still is, but during my time that was Phi Delt.  Not that there weren't gay members in the other frats (we all knew who was sleeping with who) but they weren't outwardly open.  \n\nI think you also have to think about levels of privilege as well when it comes to experiences at Colgate.  If you just look at gender identity, for instance, my trans queer friends had an incredibly difficult time on campus compared to their cisgender queer friends.  Black gay men have a different experience than white gay men.  Ability, class, etc.  It's just something I keep in mind when I was looking around at gay friendly grad schools and people said: oh everyone is accepting here.  And from their perspective it was, but it wasn't for certain groups of people (like a trans woman not being able to room with her female friend).  \n\nI liked my time at Colgate and there were a lot of positive things, but I would never have labeled it as super accepting, not really much homophobia, everyone embraces each other.  If you can, I would reach out to the LGBTQ+ coordinator at Colgate and ask if you can either speak with them or from current queer students on campus about their personal experiences.  I think you can do: lgbtq@colgate.edu \n\nHope this helps!",

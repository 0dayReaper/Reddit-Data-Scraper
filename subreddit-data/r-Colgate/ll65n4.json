                    "comment": "No. \"At the end of the day, it all boils down to luck\" is not how colleges and universities admit students. That makes it sound like throwing darts at the wall. They admit people who (a) are qualified at the admission standards of that school (which eliminates a huge number) and who (b) meet the needs of that school. What that means is that they may need science-minded students, basketball or hockey playing students, students who can pay full tuition, students from states or foreign countries they feels they \"need\" more of, students with famous parents who are likely to donate a whole crapload of money, students who have already published a novel, and so on. If you're really good at the violin, multilingual, and you're an amazing placekicker who comes from Brazil or Slovenia, guess what? You're going to beat out Joe Regularguy from Hackensack, N.J. So, no, it very definitely does not \"boil down to luck\". \n\nThere are a hundred excellent colleges and universities in this country which can claim to be \"top\" schools, meaning schools in the top 10% or so of colleges. It's hard to imagine not getting into one or more of them. It's not a very good idea to fixate on one to the exclusion of all the others or to imagine you'll only be happy there. But it's understandable and a lot of people do that. That's because it's just not true. In fact, you may be happier at a different kind of school in a different place, one that's in a warmer climate or has a slower pace of academic life or is larger and just not know it. Lots of smart, hard-working people go to colleges that weren't their number one or which they didn't realize they'd like so much, so don't get so stressed out and anxious about one college.\n\nColgate had over 17,000 applications this year for about 8-900 spaces in the first-year class. Gulp. That makes it sound like your odds are 1 of 17 or so. No. Because many accepted students are also accepted at other schools and choose to go to them instead, Colgate will take far more than that to guarantee to fill the class. If you get accepted at Yale and Colgate, you're probably going to Yale. Accepted at Williams and Colgate? Most likely Williams. Colgate and Colby? Hard to say. Accepted at Bucknell and Colgate? Probably Colgate. So maybe they'll accept 2,500 or 3,000 students in order to fill the class? And if you eliminate all the applicants who don't really meet Colgate's admissions standards, out of 17,000 you probably have at least a 1 of 4 chance of admission. Maybe even 1 of 3. \nAnd if there's something unique or special about you, maybe 1 of 2. That's pretty decent compared to Harvard, Stanford, etc. where the odds are 1 out of 20 -- or less. \n\nOne big advantage of Colgate for decades was that it offered a seriously Ivy-League quality (or better) education with top quality athletics and other first-rate programs like off-campus study, and so forth, but it didn't get a flood of applicants. That's because it was not very well known, not near a major city, and so on. It was a gem of academic excellence that got a modest number of applications every year. That may be changing. Get in before the numbers grow even bigger.",

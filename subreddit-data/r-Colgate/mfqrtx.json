    "postText": "Hi! I was accepted into Colgate and it's a top choice. I'm deciding between 2 other schools as well. If anyone could just tell me a bit about it, that would be helpful! \n\nWhat's your favorite part about Colgate? What's something you wish you could change? How would you describe the student body and is there a type of student that should definitely consider this school and type of student who wouldn't fit in as well? \n\nYou don't have to answer all of these, anything helps! Thank you!",

            "comment": "First off congratulations on your acceptance! For some context before I answer some questions, I am a Junior STEM major and I could not be happier with my decision to come to Colgate. Being at Colgate even with covid has still been one of the best experiences of my life, I\u2019ve made lifelong friends and I can\u2019t wait to have my future career accelerated through Colgate\u2019s amazing alumni network. \n\nMy favorite part about Colgate is the inter-disciplinary communities that form. You become great friends with the people in your classes if you\u2019re willing to be a little social of course and you even develop close relationships with the professors. Not to mention the professors here are often renowned in their fields and in my opinion probably over qualified, but Colgate gives them amazing benefits so that\u2019s likely why they stick around haha. Also, maybe a hot take but I love greek life on campus, if that\u2019s your thing it\u2019s a great way to make a lot of friends and have a ton of fun while also developing a network of resources to help guide you through your 4 years. The Greek life in my experience hasn\u2019t been all too toxic, there are obviously isolated events that are then quickly dealt with but if you\u2019re worried it\u2019s like Greek life at state schools then you\u2019ll be happy to hear it\u2019s nothing like that. \n\nSomething I wish I could change would be the tendency for people do default to taking Econ classes or becoming an Econ major even if they hate it. The alumni network is useful through Econ but if it\u2019s not something you enjoy then you shouldn\u2019t do it. I started off wanting to be an Econ philosophy double major and now I\u2019m in STEM and couldn\u2019t be happier! \n\nThe type of student that would love this school is a student who feels they can get out of their comfort zone to meet people and be social. I was a recluse my freshman year and it kinda sucked, but since then I\u2019ve been making friends left and right and even though I\u2019m a junior people are still eager to meet you and be your friend. I\u2019m not saying you need to be crazy social, just don\u2019t hide in your room except for meal time lol. People love meeting people and having friends so it\u2019s mutual and for that reason it shouldn\u2019t be a concern. Personally I now have a ton of friends in Greek life but also those who aren\u2019t in it, in fact I\u2019m living with 6 other people who aren\u2019t in Greek life. What I mean by that is if you don\u2019t want to do Greek life then you\u2019ll be just fine and still have an awesome college experience. \n\nAlso as a side note, when you get here try and join some clubs even if you\u2019ll never actually go. I joined rugby on a whim and it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. The club sports are a blast and a great way to get to know people. \n\nHaha another side note, I got into MAC (I looked at your other posts) and it\u2019s also a great school. I visited a handful of times and while it would\u2019ve satisfied me academically I\u2019m sure, socially I think it would\u2019ve been more difficult with it being so close to the U of M. That was my own personal opinion so take it or leave it. Best of luck with your decision, it\u2019s never an easy one, and I hope I was able to give you a little bit of insight.",

            "comment": "Hi!\nIt\u2019s a great school! It\u2019s got a great mix of being very academic during the week and in Sunday\u2019s but then pretty fun on Friday\u2019s and saturdays (little bet less so during covid but thats not forever). I\u2019d say you\u2019ll like it if you\u2019re serious about liberal arts education, as there are a couple of mandatory interdisciplinary courses. I\u2019d say you\u2019ll probably have to be a bit comfortable with some degree of partying, but you don\u2019t have to participate or drink to have a good time. I\u2019m an underclassmen but I understand that Greek life might be a bit more important than I\u2019d like for upperclassman, but you don\u2019t feel that as a freshman, and it\u2019s not a huge deal, especially if you\u2019re active in clubs or sports. But yeah I\u2019d say if you like academics, like school spirit/activities, and are at least comfortable with partying/going out on weekends then I\u2019d say you\u2019ll like it a lot. If you\u2019re a bit more introverted it can still definitely be a good fit, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s easier to be an extrovert here. Academically, I\u2019ve had great classes in stem and humanities, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s really good for any interest within a liberal arts framework (for example, probably wouldn\u2019t do it for engineering). In terms of personalities it\u2019s pretty diverse. There are a lot of prep school kids which I understand can be weird for some people at times, I went to a public school and it wasn\u2019t a problem for me. Academics are pretty serious but not too too crazy. It\u2019s a really great place with really great people and I\u2019d highly recommend it in most cases!",

I am also super curious about these things specifically I'm wondering if students ever go on trips together off-campus and if Hamilton ever gets boring being such a small town?",

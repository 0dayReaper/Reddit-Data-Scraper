    "postText": "I have recently been accepted to Colgate and I have a few questions before I decide to enroll:\n\n1) I do not plan on rushing into a Sorority and I do not play any sports. Will I feel left out?\n\n2) Someone told me that the male students are chauvinistic. Is this true?\n\n3) How would you describe the students? I read on websites like Niche that a lot of the students are snobby &amp; arrogant. Is this true or are most students nice &amp; inclusive?\n\n4) What do you think about the safety on campus (especially for girls)?\n\nThank you in advance!!",

            "comment": "1. Possibly, but if you\u2019re involved with other activites/make friends freshmen year you should be fine. This might lead to moments of slight FOMO but it\u2019s not like everyone does either of those and you\u2019ll have other options socially.\nIn terms of chauvinist maybe a little but not more so than other schools I\u2019d say for the most part and there\u2019s quite a range.snobbishness yeah there\u2019s a lot of prep school kids but also a lot of rly humble and great people so wide range on that front",

            "comment": "Congratulations!!! To answer your questions.\n\n#1 . No. My d is not into sports nor sorority. She has her sets of friends from different clubs.\n\n#2. Not sure about this one to be honest with you. I\u2019ll have to ask my d. I\u2019m thinking every school has this type of people.\n\n#3. I\u2019m basing this on my D\u2019s experience. There are definitely kids who are what they call \u201cpreppy\u201d having come from money. Like I said on 2 every campus has certain types. Colgate is becoming more and more diverse especially with your incoming class. My D has made some friends mostly the studious type.\n\n#4. Scattered along the campus are emergency posts and security campus driving around all day and night. Despite the pandemic, kids still gather and parties. Chose your friends wisely wether you decide to attend this school or somewhere else.",

I'm looking to study Economics in the northeast and have been looking into highly ranked liberal arts schools. \n\nHow does Colgate compare to colleges such as Lafayette, Connecticut College, Bard, Vassar, Trinity, Hamilton, Davidson, Tufts, Skidmore and Bucknell?\n\nPerhaps I haven't done effective digging but I've found it difficult, however, to really differentiate schools from each other. Any tips on how to do effective research on colleges?",

There\u2019s lots of comradery, and it\u2019s friendly. There\u2019s a classic work hard / play hard mentality. It\u2019s not for city people!  It\u2019s exquisite, with swans in the pond and its own ski hill and great hikes/ runs. It\u2019s small town charm. It\u2019s academically stronger than the others listed imo.",

            "comment": "Colgate alumni tend to do extremely well professionally, financially, and academically, compared to the alumni of other liberal arts colleges including the very top. Colgate alumni also tend to stay very close and committed to the school. \n\nI don\u2019t know why Colgate isn\u2019t ranked higher. It is extremely competitive both in academics and in sports. The only weaknesses I can think of are in arts and music, and perhaps the distance from urban centers which leads to the lack of guest speakers, something schools closer to big cities don\u2019t deal with.",

I think that the only university on your list that has a higher endowment-student ratio is Hamilton (which I would say Colgate has better notoriety than). \n\nhttps://www.colgate.edu/about/offices-centers-institutes/finance-and-administration/investment-office/annual-endowment\n\nI think it's also important to note that a lot of students get connections and jobs straight out of undergrad in finance/consulting and law. There are tons of recruiting events on campus and alumni are very receptive to current students reaching out.",

            "comment": "I studied intermediate microeconomic last semester under Professor Takao, who is very knowledgable. The economics program in Colgate is one of the best programs at the school tbh, that and the Japanese dept, International Relations, and also some sciences I would presume (don't know which in specific).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Econ dept. is really competitive. You will be challenged, the tests are normally curved DOWN during the first two years of courses. You're expected to know calc by Intermediate level, which I didnt know and had a disadvantage. I recommend you email professor Takao in the Econ dept. if you want to know more about Econ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest cons of colgate in my opinion is that the school has too much drinking culture, to the point of normalizing \"soft\" alcoholism. Another thing is that it is VERY disconnected to the real world in a sense. the school is very very insular. the town is very very small, but charming. You might get some seasonal depression too, its real. (and this is coming from a person that is from a very cold, cloudy place in northern USA). I've now transferred from Colgate to do design/art, which Colgate DOES NOT have a strong program in (thats the main reason): so this is all in retrospect. But without a doubt you will feel at least matched by your peers or have the opportunity and flexible to do harder classes if you want, which is very important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust keep in mind about the location. I thought it didnt matter, when I was deciding on schools, but it actually does. Youre going to spend four years in this place. So think of it like a job... a serious commitment and it will inform your way of life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps, let me know if you have more questions",

            "comment": "Just wanna add here that there are lots of hidden gems departments at Colgate - meaning among their most -ranked programs are ones that may not come to the forefront of many students' minds. A large plurality of Colgate students pursue econ, political science, and STEM tracks, and of course, these are generally highly-ranked programs. However, some of the best professors, coursework, and teaching/learning experiences will come from a few departments in particular.\n\n-Educational Studies: AMAZING. I took a course my freshman year that was so life-changing that I spent the last day of class crying in bed. They were happy tears. The professor literally changed my worldview and set me on my current academic track (not in EDUC, but in another interdisciplinary studies program). I wish I had taken more coursework in this department.\n\n-History: lots of reports will rank Colgate's history program among the top ten for undergraduates nationwide. I love the department faculty here - Cooper is a professor who can weave an entire story out of a 50-minute class, Khan is the mother of the department, and Bouk has some of the most eclectic subject matter that you can get out of history. Douglas is also badass. These faculty set me up to pursue research.\n\n-Languages: Especially Arabic. Also one of the best and most underrated in the country. The Keck Center will also fully fund Middlebury programs if you're quick to apply.\n\nSpeaking of, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies: Take. These. Courses. I don't think Prof. Rogers is there anymore, but Abdal-Ghaffar, Khan, Ahmed, and Spadola are all incredible.\n\nLastly, Environmental Studies/Geography: I don't know why this program is so great but it is. I had a roommate who went to Siberia after their freshman year so that they could do scientific research on climate change. After freshman year... And I know plenty of people who were set to do research in Antarctica. These are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.\n\nThere's also an Astrogeophysics program at Colgate which is totally funky. I can't speak to that program's strengths, though.",

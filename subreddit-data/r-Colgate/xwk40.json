    "postText": "Hello, I applied and was accepted to Colgate a year ago, but chose to go to Berkeley due to fear of isolation. After a year I haven't felt totally good about the decision (there's so much negativity and sadness on campus, and not that much to do anyway) and was considering transferring after fall semester.\n\nI know a huge part of Colgate is forming bonds with people, so that's why I'm a little concerned about transferring because I worry I'll be just as left out as I am now. Do you know what life is like for transfers? Be honest please!",

            "comment": "I am not a transfer student myself but know several people who transferred after their freshman year. It really is a question of how much effort you put into getting to know people. I've noticed that friend groups do change a bit after frosh year. I know it will be tough but by putting yourself out there, you really shouldn't have too much trouble. I honestly can't tell that my friends were transfers. \n\nBasic advice: Join a ton of clubs (just sign up for everything at the club fair) and be social.\n\nGood luck!\n\n-Colgate senior",

Or they're at least accepting of others, right?\n\nAlso do you get a lot of personal attention from staff and advisers and is that valuable and a big deal? Does the school regularly do things for students like hold events and field trips?",

It's just a question of you making the effort.\n\nI am not quite sure if transfer students get particular attention (I believe there is some group stuff the first semester) but apart from that, the personal attention you get from the staff/your adviser depends on, again, effort. Your professors will not individually seek you out. If you are having trouble or if you want special opportunities, YOU have to push for them. Your professors don't have enough time to go chasing after students. \n\nAs for what the school does, there are SO many events to go to. Seriously, I never have enough time for them all.",

I know other schools that have pledging sooner tend to firm up social circles earlier.  At Colgate, things tend to get shaken up sophomore fall anyway.\n\nJoin lots of clubs, check out Greek life it's for you (best way to immediately get 100+ new friends), and be social in your dorm.",

The student advisor was important to start you out in the social scene.  It's a little different transferring in because you don't have the freshman connection with people, but I think Colgate does a good job trying to get you into the community.  I was a transfer advisor and met one of my best friends.  Like the others said, join a ton of groups.  There was a ton of amazing stuff to do all of the time.  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your time at Colgate.  I know I did.  ",

When I was there it was a bit fratty...if that makes sense.  I think they have changed that now.  It's a small isolated school, so finding your place there is important.  Put the effort in to finding that out and it will pay off.   ",

    "postText": "Being a black male from a low socioeconomic background,  I was wondering if anyone can speak on the culture there, past the stereotypes. I spent a lot of my education around wealthy kids, so I've grown to adjust to it, but I just want to know what to expect.",

            "comment": "There is a significant contingent of students from wealthy households, and certain fraternities and sororities contain an even higher concentration than the norm. I do not think there is anything outside of Greek life that would preclude students from various socioeconomic backgrounds from mixing, but I did notice a decent amount of self-segregation during my time there (mid 2010s). Interest and music groups, clubs, and religious organizations were notably less separated.",

                    "comment": "To go off of this comment: I currently attend Colgate as a freshman, and some aspects of campus culture such as Greek life and particular sports certainly draw in noticeably high concentrations of wealthy white students. There is definitely some self-segregation around campus to an extent, but I\u2019ve found that the majority of the eleven clubs (both athletic and academic) that I participated in this past year contained diverse people from a wide variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. The effect to which you\u2019ll notice any diversity or lack thereof really depends on where you choose to spend your time and the communities that you choose to belong to. There are some wonderfully fantastic and accepting people and groups on campus, but sometimes it takes a bit of searching around to break through that initial \u2018white and wealthy\u2019 stereotype barrier. We had two distinct racist incidents this past year, but the overwhelming campus-wide reaction to these incidents was that of disgust and condemnation towards the perpetrators as well as support for the poc community on campus.",

She joined a handful of groups, especially the dance groups. Her closest friends are mix-Asians, caucasians, African-Americans and Samoan. I agree with teagan32 that groups are diverse. I've asked my daughter a few times how things are in school (we are your average to middle income family), and she said, things are okay. Typical of any schools with majority white population. She enjoyed her freshman year until March 14 the start of spring break and also the time school announced they are going to online classes and that dorms must be vacated with a few exceptions. She cried and doesn't want to leave her friends yet.",

            "comment": "Years ago, three of my best friends were premeds at Colgate. Two became leading, well-respected doctors with lots of medical articles published. The third became director of a large biochem research lab where he works on DNA. Since then, the science program has become even better with a number of new science buildings, and so on. I'd say you'll be just fine at Colgate. \n\nAs far as \"grade deflation,\" this is kind of funny. If you're a contemporary young person, you have benefitted from decades-long grade inflation that began as far back as the 1970s. So, now the problem is grade \"deflation\"? No easy A's is what you must mean. Yes, true. At Colgate you are required to work hard and do well. This is one reason Colgate grads are so sought after in business, law, medicine, and elsewhere. \n\nUpstate Medical Center is one hour away in Syracuse. FYI.",

Really enjoyed my pre-med experience at Colgate. As far as grade deflation, med schools know Colgate is tough, they take it into account. Your MCAT and letters of rec will be important as well. \n\nAs far as medical opportunities, there\u2019s the local ortho practice that I shadowed while I was there. The pre-med group has connections to nearby practices to help set you up with shadowing opportunities. \n\nWhile you\u2019re there, take advantage of the whole liberal arts experience. I double majored in Molecular Bio (went \u201cabroad\u201d to the NIH for a semester) and Classical Studies. It makes you more interesting as a person and med school applicant. Let me know if you have any other questions, I\u2019d be happy to help!",

I'm coming from a small town in the south and I haven't had the opportunity to take AP Chem or even remotely any advanced Chemistry course. Just regular Chem during the Covid Pandemic time. I arrive in two weeks but I'll study if it is beneficial. Also, do you have any insight on Curtis Hall?",

You\u2019ll find that college is about putting the appropriate time into making sure you understand the material (that means doing practice questions, going to office hours, etc.).\n\nAnd Curtis was a relatively new dorm when I was there, my wife lived there her freshman year. A bit smaller rooms, but closer to the main dining hall (Frank). She says she liked the \u201cfishbowl\u201d study space in Curtis. \n\nI hope you have the best time at Colgate, I really think you\u2019ll love it. Be sure to take advantage of all of the opportunities!",

Any fraternity (the ones who WILL throw most of the parties) will gladly welcome girls into their events.\n\nSorority girls will have access to additional and more exclusive parties however (ie mixers) which might be more your speed as you get older and learn more about the individual Greek orgs.\n\nMost girls (to my very limited knowledge; I\u2019m male) join sororities not for the partying but for other reasons: higher social status/connections after college to name a few.",

I\u2019m a current freshman and most of my girl friends are able to find drinks/get into frats pretty easily, mainly DU the football frat. For more exclusive events I\u2019m sure if you have a connection you\u2019ll be able to get in. Feel free to PM if you have any other questions!",

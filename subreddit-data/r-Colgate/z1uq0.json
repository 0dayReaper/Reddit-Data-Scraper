If that is the case, one of the things that really catches the eye of a prospective school is if you email professors in that department and ask them about the program, and see if you can take a tour of their labs when you visit the campus (you ARE planning on visiting the campus, right?)  Profs LOVE bragging about their programs and if you do have an interest in the school I would really suggest contacting the professors.  By the way, your numbers look fine.",

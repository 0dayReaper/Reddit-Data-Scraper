            "comment": "Colgate has generally extraordinarily good academics. It's very challenging. You're taught by actual professors which is not the case in many schools. \n\nYou also take small seminar-style classes far more often than huge lectures which are all too common at even top universities, including the Ivies. I had good friends at a few of the Ivies and Ivy-like schools who seemed always to be in giant lecture classes because those schools focused much more on their graduate schools than their undergraduates. Colgate is about 99% undergraduate students. High school students rarely think to ask about this, but it matters a lot in your daily academic life whether you're sitting with 300 (or even 500!) students in a lecture hall where the professor doesn't even know you, or sitting with 18 other students in a classroom where you can actually ask questions. It's a lot more fun, and I'm convinced you learn better, the second way. When I was at Colgate years ago, I had a grand total of two lecture classes, both required introductory core courses where lectures made good sense. Every other class (30 of them) that I took was a small discussion-style class, some with fewer than a dozen students. Those discussions sure took me out of my shyness real fast! This is pretty unusual for colleges, especially for larger universities, which try to maximize class size whenever it's convenient for them, thus all the large lectures. Not at Colgate. It's much more of a student's school than colleges where you're kind of processed through the curriculum pretty anonymously. \n\nThe quality of students at Colgate is also very high. Most of my friends were way smarter than I was, that's for sure. My friends became doctors, lawyers, college professors, teachers, artists, scientists. I'd put Colgate's academics up against the best colleges and universities in the country. \n\nCampus life is relaxed as you'd expect it would be in a small rural community. You make good friends, hang out and talk, work on club or organization activities (journalism, radio, etc.), maybe see a movie or a play or go to a concert. There are lots of club sports you can get involved in. And varsity sports are kind of a big deal with a lot of people, if you're interested in that, and they're just better than most equivalent small colleges which don't try very hard at sports. Colgate mostly plays \"up\" against bigger schools rather than against the \"small Ivies\". \n\nOff-campus study groups are a big deal, and you can spend a semester or more overseas, if you want. My daughter who also went to Colgate spent a semester in Paris, for example. \n\nI've always said if Colgate were near a major city, it would have twice as many applicants -- and you'd never get in.",

    "postText": "I'm super excited to be joining Colgate's class of '21 this fall! That being said, I'm also nervous to be coming into what seems to be a pretty small and tight-knit community. I've applied to a couple jobs around campus, and I'm planning on rushing in the fall, but if anyone has any advice or experience as to what I should be expecting as a transfer student please let me know!\n\nAlso, if anyone has any tips for actually getting to Colgate I'm all ears. I've heard the best way is to fly into Syracuse- is this true?",

Social life is dominated by Greeks and very drinking heavy, but if you\u2019re a woman you should be fine even if you don\u2019t rush. Also everyone smokes weed and the hookup culture is rampant. I just graduated, feel free to ask me any specific questions!",

                            "comment": "Colgate is not an ideal school for pre-med. It focuses on social sciences and especially economics. Very few students go to medical school; law school and grad school are much more common. However, the pre-med program is pretty respectable, just brutally hard. Lots of people switch and leave the pre-med track because they can\u2019t pass organic chemistry in particular. My degree is in political science though so I don\u2019t have any particular advice, except that pre-med students are often too busy to have time for sorority activities.\n\nI have plenty of insight about sororities, since I spent most of my upperclassmen years hanging out in them. Rushing is not allowed for freshman. Usually only sophomores rush, but some juniors and transfer students do too. Sorority rushing is pretty competitive because there are only 3 sororities on campus and they just don\u2019t have enough space to meet the demand. It helps to already have friends in the sorority, but it\u2019s not impossible to get in. Rush week has a few events which are basically all meet-and-greet style, or dinners in the later rounds. When you go to them, definitely focus on talking to the sisters, not the other people rushing. The strategy is basically like speed dating; make a good impression quickly but don\u2019t seem desperate.\n\nI like Tri Delta, most of my friends and my girlfriend were in that house. It has an amazing kitchen and I think the most rooms too. They are the least likely to deny you membership for reasons of appearance, wealth, etc. G Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma are less about sisterhood and more about status, social climbing, and partying, which I wouldn\u2019t worry about because women can go to just about any party on campus even if they\u2019re non-Greek. There are also rumors of an underground society of friends, a lost fourth sorority.... but shhhhhhh the admin isn\u2019t supposed to know. It all depends on what you\u2019re looking for. Tri Delt is a homey place of sisters, G Phi are high achievers, athletes, and other competitive types, Kappa is basically a bunch of cocaine snorting Barbies but I\u2019ll admit they\u2019re a lot of fun. They\u2019re all fine though, and I would focus on being open-minded and just seeing if you click with some people rather than viewing it like an audition or contest.",

Sadly Phi Delt has been in some serious trouble for various things lately, it\u2019s not a great time to join them. They\u2019re a bit sketchy anyway. Theta Chi seem like better dudes.\n\nBeta Theta Pi is a little country club full of legacies that all want to work on Wall Street. Big watches, sports cars, you get the idea... They used to have lots of coke and attract the kind of women who like to hang out around money and coke. They got in trouble recently though and have been on probation, but I think it\u2019s ending soon.\n\nPhi Tau are fuckbois but a good time to hang out with. They have the smallest house though. Used to have killer parties regardless, but now they just drink on their porch and play spikeball.\n\nDU, my frat, is mostly football players. It has the best parties and biggest house but isn\u2019t really a traditional frat.\n\nSigma Chi and DKE are underground (as in unofficial, no house, and you get expelled if anyone finds out you\u2019re in them, at least that\u2019s the \u201cofficial\u201d policy). DKE has been underground for a very long time, whereas Sigma went underground in my sophomore year.\n\nIn short, join Theta Chi or Phi Tau if you can. Things with the frats change fast and constantly though, their reputations and disciplinary status may already be different than when I left.",

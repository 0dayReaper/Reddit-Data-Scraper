Positives-the rigors of the academics means you\u2019ll be well prepared for mcat, medical school, etc. Lots of great research, shadowing, volunteering. Negatives is Colgate will kick your ass, the classes are very very hard for pre med. A good gpa at colgate 3.2-3.5 isnt great for medical school. Lots of my friends and myself included did post bacs/masters programs bc of this.",

            "comment": "I was a first year a colgate last year but transferred to the UofR for fall. I am also a pre-med. Similar to what the guys said above, Colgate\u2019s academics are rigorous. My first semester I only took Gen Chem 1 and it kicked my ass. I ended up with a B- even though it was the class I put in the most effort for. Granted, my high school wasn\u2019t very challenging and I was a first generation student so it took me longer to adjust to Colgate academics. Second semester was a lot better, I got both A-\u2018s in chem 2 and bio. But that also took a lot of effort. I performed above average on every exam so I assume that the averages were probably in the B\u2019s and C\u2019s, and even my chem professor said they aimed for the average to be around 70 when they create exams. And due to COVID, he also curved the grades a bit so the average was a B+ for Gen Chem II overall. So yeah, academics are definitely challenging but it\u2019s really nice because I became close with all my professors since the classes are so small. My chem professor even stayed after his office hours to help me understand homework assignments. I don\u2019t believe NYU would have that, or at least, not common since it\u2019s so large. In terms of pre-med, the advisor Dr. Chanatry is super nice and during my first meeting, she asked me my major and literally wrote me a whole schedule of what classes to take. You can get involved with SOMAC (the EMS in the community) but it\u2019s pretty time consuming. I also volunteered with Colgate Caretakers, and we basically visited the community health center and spent time with residents with mental disabilities. There are resources if you seek them out! Also, pre med advisor said most pre-meds at Colgate take a gap year or two because colgate is so challenging that they just want to take a break.",

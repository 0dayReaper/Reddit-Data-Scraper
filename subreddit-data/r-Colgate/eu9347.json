            "comment": "Just my two scents and big caveat I was not a major but I did take 4/5 history classes and was friends with some of the major students. The Colgate History department overall had the best quality of professors. All very knowledgeable, engaging, cares for their students. And very few had an ego. Obviously I didnt have everyone so I\u2019m sure theres some bad apples. Colgate also has a great alumni network so it\u2019s not as daunting to go out into the world with a history degree at Colgate than at other schools.",

            "comment": "After Colgate I became a private school history teacher (after earning a master's in history) and taught for 46 years. Yes, I went there a long time ago. The History Department was famous even then for first-rate professors. \n\nHistory is amazing because it's about what humans have done, how we got here, and what it all means for good or bad. It's a story with lessons to try to recognize -- and argue about. With a history education you can make sense of the world. Without it, you're likely to be confused and fall victim to all sorts of claims about the past that are simply not true. As we see today. \n\nMajoring in history does not mean you will teach it later. Most history majors do other things. A history major is good preparation for law school and for business and many other professions. It's possible today even to go to medical school with a social sciences or humanities major. There really is no necessary connection between what you major in and the profession you decide to go into later. There are, of course, with some majors like students who are pre-meds or who major in computer science, and a few other majors. But that's more \"job training\" than the broad education I wanted to get. That's a major advantage of liberal arts colleges. Liberal arts colleges are about educating you, not about job training. You end up so well educated and well prepared for all sorts of professions. Should you then want to specialize, there's always grad school. All my close friends went to grad school for MD's, law degrees, Ph.D's or MA's. \n\nMy daughter also went to Colgate. She majored in Poli Sci, then worked for awhile in the food industry and now works in a different start-up industry unconnected to politics or government. She does amazingly well. My father went to Colgate, also, a long time ago. He became president of a financial corporation in NYC. He majored in psychology. So major in whatever you love. Take whatever courses seem interesting. Your later career will work out just fine.",

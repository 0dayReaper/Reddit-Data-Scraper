            "comment": "Not overtly. I think the vast number of people are very accepting but there's a definitely a dark underbelly of people who I'd guess get really racist when they're drunk, so we've had some racist incidents (like writing something racist on a whiteboard or Chinese New Year's flag), they seem to happen about once a year. \n\nI think there might be a bit of subtle racism as well that involves every group including international students, because it seems like there's a lot of self-segregation that goes on after international students get here. Not in every single group obviously, but it seems like the first one or two years international students kind of stick with other people form their home area.\n\nEditing to add that structurally there is a huge amount of support for internationals on campus. I forget what it's called but the office of international affairs or whatever is really awesome and you'll always have a group of people there advocating for you and making sure you get treated fairly on a higher level and have every resource you need to succeed. If racist incidents do occur, MOST of the student body will rally against whoever did it. \n\nI'm not international but lmk if you have any other questions, I'm friends with a lot of international students and have helped with the international student orientation",

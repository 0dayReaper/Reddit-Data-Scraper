    "postText": "Students not adhering to the rules and agreements made by Colgate University during this pandemic, selfishly breaking them were sent home not even before the start of classes. When everyone from the schools, communities, counties and states(NY in this case) are trying to make things possible for us to return to as normal as possible to campus without compromising the safety of everyone in the school and community, the school administration made clear of the seriousness of the situation and the consequences of the students\u2019 selfish actions. Kudos to the school for setting these students straight. \n\n\nDear Parents and Family Members,\nI\u2019m sharing this latest update sent to the campus community today.\n\nWhile we believe in the capacity of our students learning on campus this fall to adhere to the commitment they have signed \u2014 and to demonstrate their dedication to this community through their behaviors this fall semester \u2014 we also recognize there will be moments along the way when we must help them to remember the impacts of their decisions on others on campus and within the Village of Hamilton. We are encouraging all members of the community to be active bystanders, and for anyone who sees a violation to report it.\n\nWe are also keenly aware that we cannot simply post rules on a website, and we cannot police every student's behavior.\n\nWe must be proactive in helping instill in the students both the spirit of the commitment to themselves, their peers, and the community, as well as a clear understanding of what that looks like on a day-to-day basis.\n\nWe encourage all family members to join with us in reinforcing the crucial importance of the Commitment to Community Health.\n\nAs always, if I can be of assistance, feel free to write to parents@colgate.edu.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\n\nSr. Director, Communications &amp; Parent Initiatives\nOffice of Communications\n\n\u00a0\nDear Colgate Community,\n\nOn Monday, the University learned of a party in a residence hall that was in violation of the Commitment to Community Health. Gatherings, particularly during this quarantine period of Gate-0, are strictly forbidden as they jeopardize the health and wellbeing of our entire campus. We are also investigating reports of additional violations.\n\nI take no pleasure in announcing that as a result of these students\u2019 actions, several students are being sent to their homes to study remotely. Decisions like these are some of the hardest to make as an educator; however, when the stakes are as high as they are this semester, careless mistakes by individuals can lead to considerable consequences for the entire community. These students will remain enrolled at Colgate, but they have lost their privilege of being on campus this semester.\n\nHundreds of Colgate staff and faculty have been working tirelessly for months to prepare for on-campus learning this fall semester. I am grateful that most community members are doing their part by adhering to the Commitment to Community Health. While the University\u2019s plan for reopening is comprehensive, it is predicated on executing each element with precision. It is on behalf of the entire community, and in acknowledgement of the work already invested, that the University has taken this important, albeit difficult step, to enforce one critical part of our plan to be together: the Commitment to Community Health.\n\nI ask each of you to refamiliarize yourself with the language in the Commitment to Community Health that clearly sets forth our expectations for this semester. The Commitment reads, in part:\n\n\u201cBecause of the potentially severe public health effects of noncompliance, those who do not adhere to these expectations will face significant disciplinary consequences, including parental notification, loss of the privilege to live in residence (for students living in University-owned housing), forfeiture to come on to campus (for students living in privately-owned housing), suspension or even expulsion.\u201d\n\nThe Commitment is a pledge that has been signed by every student learning on campus this semester, and it will continue to be vigorously enforced so long as the Coronavirus remains a threat. You should also familiarize yourself about what is permitted during the universal quarantine and within each Gate. If you are unclear about Colgate\u2019s policies, please visit colgate.edu/colgate-together for additional information or contact me directly. If you have information about any individuals not following the University\u2019s expectations this semester, please address this behavior directly, if you feel comfortable, or please submit a report so we may continue upholding the integrity of the Commitment to Community Health.\n\nSeeing students on campus this week has been energizing and been the reward for our hard work over the last several months. This beginning of the academic year is my personal favorite and I also feel the excitement of being together. I urge you to channel the palpable energy of this moment with a long-view of the semester, by making decisions that will allow us to be together for the duration of the semester. I also remind you to be vigilant in your collective actions of caring for each other through the simple measures of wearing face coverings, maintaining physical distance, frequent hand washing, and importantly, adhering to the Commitment to Community Health.",

There are so many clubs and activities, it\u2019s been non stop since move in day. You have to put yourself out there and get involved. Did you join a club last week when they had the club fair? There were so many options. And the library has board games and you can also organize game nights on your floor in your commons. Lots of people who don\u2019t party. I\u2019m sure if you get out and do things you\u2019ll find them.",

I signed up to play club volleyball (played varsity in HS) and club hockey lol which I always wanted to play but my mom couldn\u2019t get me to practices as a single mom but I did figure skate and thought, now\u2019s the time to have fun and do something I always wanted. And guess what, they even have all the equipment there so no cost. As one of the few students (I\u2019m sure there are lots of us but why announce it lol) without a rich family I am still able to do anything and everything at Colgate and I am so happy!",

            "comment": "I went to Colgate some years ago, and I never drank. A lot of my friends did, of course, but so what? It was occasional partying that didn't bother me much, and most were not very serious drinkers. Don't cut yourself off from everyone over drinking. When I did go to a party, which I did a few times a year, I carried a beer around and sort of sipped at it from time to time, but never really drank. It solved the \"why aren't you drinking?\" problem. And I met a lot of interesting people at parties, including some really nice girls I never would have met otherwise. \n\nTo find friends, you have to go where the people are. If you're appealing, intelligent, and fun to be with, you'll make friends. You do that through sports, teams or clubs, or through other kinds of clubs for all the organizations on campus. My daughter went to Colgate, and she joined the women's rugby team which she absolutely loved. She made most of her friends that way. She was tiny, hardly a great athlete, but she loved the whole experience, anyway. \n\nI was in a fraternity, mainly to make friends and get the wisdom of upperclass students, but I hardly ever drank, as I've said. It's not hard to do. In fact, I found people respect you more if you aren't always getting drunk. Joining made a big difference in my life, though I can't say I'm a big supporter of fraternities, many of which are pretty silly. But mine was really great for me. \n\nJust get out of yourself, join some organizations of some kind, and you will make friends. Just \"being there\" does not make you any friends. Nor is being in a freshman dorm going to make you many friends. You have to join something. Don't wait too long as time is going by. Early in my freshman year, I passed up a chance to be on the newspaper and I always regretted it. But I did join other groups, played some intramural sports (I'm not much of an athlete, but I like sports), became a fraternity officer, and I made some good friends just by being involved and cheerful. When clubs meet, go and visit them. See which you like. They all need members. Don't be hesitant. It's the way the whole world works.",

I was active in multiple sports and activities but still found it hard to get outside of that one close group. Still had the most amazing time all through school BUT I told myself when I went to college I would get outside of my comfort zone. When I got there I was so homesick the first two nights as soon as the crazy orientation stuff was done for the day. I was determined to get out of the funk quickly and though a ton of people were partying those first few nights I pushed myself out of my dorm, went to the gym and met a few girls then another group joined us at the dining hall, I joined two club sports teams, went to every activity that looked fun last week- bingo, game night, freshman formal, and am so glad I did because I already have met so many amazing people. And I\u2019ve hung out with others who drink but I have no desire to and no one cares if I do. You\u2019re right and I agree that the original poster needs to get involved and out of their dorm. If I can do it, arguably the quietest person alive, anyone can. I think this is the time to be someone you want to be without fear. So far so good! \ud83d\ude42",

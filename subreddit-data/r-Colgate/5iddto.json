Is there any advice you guys might have that could be helpful for a high school student transitioning to Colgate? Academic advice, social advice, or even a fact about the university, I would appreciate anything. XD Hooray for the class of 2021!!!",

            "comment": "Congrats, I remember when I got my acceptance letter its a great feeling.  Some advice:\n\n1 - Never skip class if possible \n\n2 - Talking to your Professors during office hours can be the difference between a B- and a B\n\n3 - Rush during your sophomore year.  You don't have to join Greek life but definitely check it out. \n\n4 - Join a club, sport or otherwise.  All of my best friends from Colgate I met at Club Soccer Freshmen year\n\n5 - Leave your dorm room open, its how you will meet people and eventually your friends\n\n6 - Be prepared for snow and then more snow and then more snow\n\n7 - Fun Fact, the inventors of Trivial Pursuit went to Colgate.  Good luck! Any other questions feel free to PM me.\n\nGo 'Gate! ",

If it happens to be some field of science, make sure you chat with your processors about getting research experience.

I was a biology major but that didn't stop me from taking art classes or history classes about pirates. ",

Other than that it really helps to be a somewhat extroverted person freshmen year (this applies to all colleges really) try to meet and form connections with as many people as possible. For me doing Greek life or joining a club sport wasn't necessary to make friends though it can definitely be an enjoyable part of the Colgate experience and help you meet people.",

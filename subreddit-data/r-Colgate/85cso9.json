    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am an international student who yesterday received his acceptance letter to Colgate. I really liked the atmosphere and the location of the university. I wonder, however, about the quality of education in Colgate. How good a college is Colgate considered in US? How good do you think its ECON curriculum would be? Is education very cutthroat? Are there any other major tips you think I should know of beforehand?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I went to Colgate, minored in Econ. The department is the biggest in the University, so it is less cozy and harder to develop relationships with your professors. You should research a bit about the professors in the department, because a bad professor can destroy your passion for anything but a good professor can make you love any topic including microeconomics or econometrics.

Additionally, that information is freely available online, at least from a rankings and statistics standpoint. That being said, it's one of the best liberal arts schools in the country, and economics is one of the most popular majors, if not the most popular.",

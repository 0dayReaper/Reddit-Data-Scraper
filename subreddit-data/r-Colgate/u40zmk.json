            "comment": "People think they're being really clever by joking about Colgate's name. Get used to it. I've heard it all my life, sometimes even from smart people. But it's the most obvious joke, so they're going for the low-hanging fruit. \n\nIt's kind of sad when someone says an obvious joke you've heard dozens of times before. If you have an odd-sounding name, you know what I mean. Partly, I think, it's motivated by other people's need to \"put you in your place\". They went to State University of Nowhere or one of the weaker Ivies, so they fire a shot across your bow to tell you they think your college's name is kind of funny. Okay, if that's the best you can do. \n\nI usually just smile and say, \"Gosh, I attended Colgate over 50 years ago, and I don't think I've ever heard anyone make that joke before.\" It makes them uncomfortable. I mean, the joke is on anyone who can't come up with anything other than the most cliched thing possible. \n\nFor the smart people, I sometimes tell them that since they've just made a bad joke, now they have to listen to an explanation. I say, \"As you know, many of the country's best colleges are named after someone who was extremely rich -- Duke for a tobacco millionaire, Vanderbilt was a railroad guy, Stanford ditto, Carnegie-Mellon was an industrialist and a financier, Brown a rich businessman, even Harvard was a rich guy who gave them his entire library. Colgate was originally named Madison University, named after you know who, and it's a perfectly good name. But in honor of James B. Colgate who owned the Colgate-Palmolive Company in the late 19th century (soap, toothpaste, and so on) who had donated a huge pile of money because of how impressed he was at how well educated his son was there, the university renamed itself in his honor.\" It's a sweet and uplifting story -- if your jokester friend has the attention span to hear it. I always feel that it someone jokes about a name, the least they can do is listen to a brief explanation of where the name came from. If they aren't paying attention, I remind them \"Hey, you brought up the name, so pay attention. Maybe you'll learn something.\" I'm pretty relentless about it. \n\nI have a daughter with a slightly odd, foreign name (she was adopted), so I hear the same jokey thing about her. I have the same response about it, took, which is to insist that the person listen to my explanation for half a minute. If someone insists on making a joke about a person's name, the least they can do is listen to a brief explanation. I get a lot of \"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize\".\n\nAnd, there's a final point you can make, if you want to. Of all those other famous rich guys' names given to universities, Carnegie, Stanford, Ezra Cornell, and so on, none of their companies still exists (I think this is true) -- except Colgate, which is still a thriving, successful company. Would you want your school named after, an old rich dead guy whose company is also dead -- or after someone whose company was so good it's still in business?\n\nAfter a few times, you'll get pretty good at this. Great school, amazing place, so work hard and have fun. Go 'Gate!",

You\u2019re going to get a great education that sets you up for a lot of success in life, so the joke is on them anyway",

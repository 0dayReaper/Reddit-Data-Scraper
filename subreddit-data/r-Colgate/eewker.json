    "postText": "**Background:**\n\nEast Asian family that makes about $48K after taxes with a household of 3. Dad grew up here (but not born here) and went to college and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s. Mom grew up in Hong Kong and never went to college. She is a stay at home mom.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Stats\\*\\*:\n\n3.8 unweighted GPA (92%)\n\n1310 SAT\n\nTook APUSH &amp; AP Lang in junior year (my school only offers up to 3 APs starting junior year) Got a 4 on both.\n\nGrades have technically been on a downward trend since I went to a unchallenging high school in freshmen year resulting in an average of 99%. Sophomore year was 94%, junior year was 85%. This year\u2019s marking period was an 89%.\n\nLetters of Recommendation: Okay so suddenly things have become complicated and I accidentally got myself 4 LoRs. One of them is from my Professor which I know from my lab research internship I just finished (today actually) doing. One of them is from my AP Lang and now AP Lit teacher who knows me well and is great at writing recs. One of them is from my Biology teacher from junior year but he didn't really know me personally, yet I did well in his class. Lastly my 9th grade global history teacher wrote me one but I'm not sure how strongly he can vouch or say about my academic skills since my 9th grade school was so academically unchallenging.\n\nI'm not sure if I can pick and choose my LoRs and cross off a teacher off my list.\n\n\\*\\*Extracurriculars\\*\\*:\n\nDid 7 clubs overall throughout high school (4 in sophomore year, 2 in junior one of them being Model UN, and continuing Model UN this year with another club)\n\nPart of National Honor Society since 11th grade\n\nPlayed in the school talent school in 10th grade\n\nTook Saturday classes at Brooklyn College since 10th grade\n\nGot accepted to a research internship in 11th grade from Brooklyn College, did the coursework for the summer internship for the whole junior year and started my internship in the summer of 2019. I presented my experiment at a research symposium/consortium at City College. I was told by my professor that I am listed as a co-author in the research paper he\u2019s writing about my experiment, and that my overall research will be presented at a Psychology conference. As I said, he's also writing me a recommendation.\n\n**College Essay:** My CommonApp essay is about my lab internship experience and how I grew from that experience through accepting that I needed help from others and no longer running away from responsibilities or opportunities that seemed challenging or impossible to me.",

That being said, if you seem to fit the mold of the \"typical\" student at Colgate (that is, good-ish on paper, okay essays, good recs, career-oriented goals), you should be fine. Your essay sounds like it would catch the attention of the admissions committee.\n\nIn-state shouldn't bother you. There seem to be a lot of in-state students at Colgate. I believe I recall someone telling me they comprise between 20 and 30 percent of the student population.",

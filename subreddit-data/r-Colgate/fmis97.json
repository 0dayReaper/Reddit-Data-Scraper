            "comment": "Hey! I'm a current freshman at Colgate, and I'm an undeclared Astrophysics major. Colgate has an incredible physics program, but it starts off a little different compared to other schools. Chemistry is not needed for a physics major at Colgate, and you start off in a class called atoms and waves, which deals with a range of topics from relativity to mean free path and diffusion. There is a bit of chemistry integrated as well. From there, mechanics and E&amp;M are taken, and you also take classes learning how to code with Matlab. As far as research, you have a wide range of opportunities. There is summer research available, with the physics department having around 8 ( I believe) different professors, focusing on different topics from studying quasars in the observatory, to electronics, to biophysics involving molluscs. There are a few current seniors that can probably tell you a bit more. If you have any more questions, feel free to DM me!",

I want to major in astronomy and I hear both colleges have a very good program. If I want to major in astronomy, what are your thoughts? (PS. I cant apply to ivy league as my grades are amazing but the only AP courses I take are AP physics, and my SAT score is only a 1240).",

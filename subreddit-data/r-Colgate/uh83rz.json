My previous college was in a major city with minimal Greek life, so I\u2019d mainly go to bars/clubs downtown. \n\nWhat do you guys typically do on the weekends, and is there a good party scene? I\u2019ve heard the jug accepts anyone with a Colgate ID, but I was wondering if there was anything else.",

There\u2019s also Greek life parties from time to time that you can also go to. Due to Colgate being so remote the jug is definitely a popular place to go.",

I didn\u2019t have much difficulty getting into frat parties at my old school, but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019ll be more difficult since I don\u2019t know anyone\n\nAlso, where would clubs typically party, since everyone is required to live on campus? In my experience you can\u2019t really throw parties in the dorms cause of RA\u2019s",

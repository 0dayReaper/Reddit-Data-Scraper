            "comment": "Colgate has an unusually loyal alumni network, but remember it is a small college. The number of students that graduate from Colgate in a decade (c. 750 x 10) about equals the number of ten or twenty other school's graduates every year. If you want enormous alumni involvement by the numbers, you'll find that at large state universities. But for such a small school it's pretty impressive how many Colgate alums help students out and contribute in other ways.\n\nI have friends from many other similar small liberal arts schools that don't have any connection or much interest in their alma mater. They treat it like some place they \"just happened\" to go to once, more like a summer camp they once went to. Most Colgate alums aren't like that.\n\nIn looking for internships and jobs, you just need to ask and keep asking for what you want. No one will come to you. Also talk to other students. I found some good summer jobs by just talking about it with other students at lunch!",

Don\u2019t call expecting to get an appointment with an advisor that day/week. They have a summer funding program (I got this one summer) where you can get $5k to pursue an unpaid or underpaid internship, course, etc during the summer. Alumni network is really crazy no matter what field you go into. Learn to network early and you\u2019ll be good for a job at graduation",

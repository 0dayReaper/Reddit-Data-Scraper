Answer basically any question they have, and provide any resource they need.\n\nI think what separates this from sites like Princeton Review is that most college reviews ask questions of the reviewers that are too general.  This leads kids to omit certain information.  Information that college applicants would want to know! I thought hard about what kids would want to know (and asked other people), and I came up with a bunch of questions.  I think that if I could get people to answer them, this would be a great resource for college applicants to get their questions answered! If you could answer some questions for Colgate, I'd be extremely appreciative!",

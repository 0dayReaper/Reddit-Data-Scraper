I highly suggest doing it in the late fall or early spring. Quite honestly, that's when the campus looks its worst (mud, and half melted snow basically). If you still love it then, then Colgate is the right school for you. That's what I did. I used to laugh at the students who toured in June or those two weeks in the fall when the leaves are gorgeous... they didn't know what they were getting into.\n\nSorry to focus on the weather so much. I graduated several years ago so I'm not really able to speak about current classes but I always like to make sure people know what they're getting into, location-wise. My freshman year roommate had been living in central Africa for the ten years before Colgate... boy, did she have a bit of a shock. \n\nAre you interested in studying anything in particular?",

And quite honestly, i go to a boarding school with the campus so shitty it takes 4 mins to walk around the WHOLE campus so I'm used to shittu campuses haha.  \nBut frankly, i don't think the campus is the thing that would scare me away tho. I fell in love with the school from what i heard and i already have contacted several of the EC i want to enroll in including the rugby team!  \nI'm planning to study environmental studies with a focus on sustainability (colgate now is carbon neutral Wohooo)  and maybe minor in peace and conflict",

Colgate is typically rated one of the most beautiful campuses in the country, don't get me wrong. It just tends to get a bit grey during the winter which some people can't cope with. The campus is decently large. You'll certainly get a workout climbing up and down the hill!\n\nThe rugby team is excellent (both men and women, not sure which one you were thinking of joining). They're a great group and are extremely good for a club team.\n\nI was a biology major focusing in ecology so I'm familiar with the science departments because a lot of the faculty overlap. The science facilities and professors are excellent. You've definitely picked a good area of interest.",

I would gladly answer any specific questions you have about anything with the caveat that I was the last class before their bicentennial celebration and I'm sure they have changed a few things since then even though it's only been a year. :)",

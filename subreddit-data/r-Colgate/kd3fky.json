I\u2019m weighing the options and I feel the flavor in my mouth is only for like two hours in the morning whilst the charcoal whitening will have greater dental benefits for my mouth over he long run. I decided y\u2019all could help me with this decision. Thanks in advance",

Think about the fact that decades later I would pay good money for such a shirt.  He tells me that things like that were REALLY looked down on at the time by parts of the student body.",

Also be aware that using charcoal regularly on your teeth will abrade them (if you went to Cornell, you can look that word up) and could cause long-term damage.",

    "postText": "It has become clear that Residential Life has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of making the room selection process even worse. This, combined with the continued and obvious disconnect between Res Life and students/parents, clearly indicates that Colgate needs a change. \n\nBrenda Ice needs to go (how does she still have a job, especially with her disgusting response to student feedback last year?) and it is time for some drastic restructuring. Jarrell Anderson has been equally incompetent (not to mention evidence of repeated instances of his bold-faced lying to students).  \n\nFire Brenda Ice. Fire Jarrell Anderson. Fix this office. No more excuses. ",

It's separate from the portal and the people at ITS can't really do much to help, if there's a system problem. Added to this is the fact that ResLife is useless and incompetent and absolutely unable to resolve any of the many problems with their new technology. You can't have all the pick times in the evening, not give ITS access and training on the new system, and then abandon students to the mercy of your new untested and unproven system without maintaining an adequate staffing level in the late evening to help resolve any problems that pop up.\n\nResLife is probably the most poorly run department at Colgate - and that's saying something.",

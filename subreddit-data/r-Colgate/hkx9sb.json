I am open to exploring but as an international student, I would not want to go to a school that does not have a strong CS department in case i follow through with the subject. The number/variety of CS courses available at Colgate seems to be really underwhelming.** \n\n**Could someone studying CS at Colgate please tell me how good CS is?**",

            "comment": "I personally love our cs department, I think its strength is our professors. Because the department is small (as a function of the school being small) you're able to make really strong connections with each professor you have. If you're interested in research, it's also much easier to get a position than it would be at a larger school (btw I'm not an international student but a lot of students who live farther away do research because it means you are able to gain experience and money while not going home over the Summer unless you'd like to for a few weeks at the end). There seems to be pretty good job placement after graduation, and I've personally been able to get a pretty competitive internship this Summer. Keep in mind that they're also in the process of hiring new cs professors and trying to expand the department, although it's happening slower than I would like.\n\nAll this being said: Colgate is still a small liberal arts school. If you're only interested in STEM and cs you won't be able to only take  STEM classes while here due to the core curriculum. If you really just want to focus on purely honing your cs and want a large student body that's NOT in the middle of nowhere, consider another school. \n\nPersonally, I feel like there's a value in being  well-rounded, and value the opportunities that a small school allows for. Ngl it does get claustrophobic though, I feel like that aspect should honestly be your biggest concern. \n\nIf you have any questions hmu!",

I did and got accepted. I think Covid had a big impact on my time there, but if you\u2019re a big social butterfly, the school is definitely for you. Big alcohol scene there, which I was not apart of. Also, check that it has your classes and majors you\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019re undecided, that\u2019s in your favor going into Colgate.\n\nIf you know what you want, go out and look for it. If you\u2019re social and you like the kind of stuff I said above, go for it! The school unfortunately wasn\u2019t for me, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t for anyone else.\n\nEdit: The reason I did finally apply EDII, was because I thought the campus was very scenic. Don\u2019t make that your sole reason for going.",

A very big drinking scene, so if you're in a suite with drinkers (4+ nights a week) and you're not, it's isolating.  The cliquiness is rampant (e.g. not accepted into one program because they also joined another and the two groups \"don't get along\").  To them, it feels like they're trapped in a box with nowhere to go, so it's not for everyone.   \n\nIt is a pretty campus though.",

                            "comment": "This is a very troubling comment to me, a Colgate alum whose daughter also went to Colgate -- as did my brother years ago. \n\nColgate does have an extraordinarily beautiful campus which looks like a movie set for a \"college\". It's like a postcard. I used to take long walks around campus to clear my head and settle my anxieties, and it's a really attractive place. A little too far from New York City which I was used to for me at the time, but the world isn't all busy streets, is it? \n\nAs for getting along with others and getting involved in groups by which I think you mean extracurriculars, I've never heard of this clique issue you mention but perhaps it exists from time to time with certain groups of students. All colleges are bound to have that, I'm absolutely sure. After all, every year there are different students on campus, and every few years the entire student body changes. So I'm pretty sure any attempt at stereotyping a school's student body as \"spoiled\" or \"rich kids\" or that sort of thing, which you see a lot in talking about colleges, doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nAs for \"not being accepted into one program,\" I have no idea what that refers to. Yet you say they \"joined another\" which suggest they did join some program or other? So, I'm confused. How many of these programs do they need to be involved in? Are these campus clubs or some kind? Campus organizations abound at Colgate and by school policy, they are open to anyone who wants to join. That doesn't mean that all the officers of a club will like you or welcome you, though. Welcome to life, I guess. My experiences my first year on the Colgate newspaper were a little unpleasant in some ways, but they hardly scarred me. I just moved on to other things. \n\n I have no idea what activity your child was (is?) involved in -- which would be helpful to know -- but there are about a hundred campus clubs and organizations. I was on the Colgate newspaper briefly (called the \"Maroon\" at the time, now the \"Maroon News\"), but found it hard to get reporting assignments since older students naturally felt they had worked their way up so deserved all the good news assignments, so pretty much what you'd expect -- but I didn't know that at the time. Standard stuff I now realize -- but at age 18, a bit hard to take, and I admit I was kind of a wimp, much too shy for my own good, and so on. It took me awhile to gain my confidence, to grow up really. I was a teacher for many decades after college, and I became good at dealing with large numbers of teen-age types without problems, a skill I lacked when I was 18. I started to gain that confidence at Colgate, and I think it was partly because I didn't quite even when I wanted to. \n\nI do recognize the whole drinking issue which I also disliked when I was there. And it's not just Colgate, but just about every college in America has this same problem (even \"Christian\" colleges struggle with it). I doubt your child will find some refuge from drinking somewhere else on a campus where drinking is not a problem. Where is such a place? I don't think they exist. It may be worse at Colgate, but maybe not. I know a lot of \"top\" colleges have this problem.As a teacher who talked to hundreds of students over the years, I'm pretty confident about this. \n\nWhen I was there, lots of students drank a lot, except it didn't seem like much fun to me. So I didn't drink when I was at Colgate, and I don't drink now. Many of my friends did drink, some more than others, but many others did not drink at all. It just takes time to find the friends you enjoy being with. There is really no reason your child can't just not drink. I did go to parties. Why not? They're fun. I'd carry a beer so I looked sociable and still have a lot of fun. I can be very loud. I don't know anyone who sat around in their dorm room drinking, even as freshman. That is pretty pathetic. It's a hard school academically so you have to blow off steam, but by drinking? Most of my friends were very good athletes, artists, or some such thing, so that was their fun.\n\nI'm going to guess that more is going on than just being stuck with some roommates who drink. Mostly likely, the roommates are not very pleasant people in other ways. In that case, ask for a room change. I did. And if your child has been somewhat isolated as they grew up, is a quiet or shy person, or lacks confidence, then they're just like I was. \n\nFreshman year, I had two roommates who were basketball players, and they talked about nothing but basketball 24/7. Hey, at least they didnt' drink! But they had no interest in anything else -- and their sloppiness was really bad. After awhile, I could not take it. Ever smell old socks and basketball shoes every single day? These two clowns had never even learned how to do their laundry. Ever try to study while someone was bouncing a basketball in the next room? It got to be too much. So, one day around this time of year, I just waltzed over to the Housing Office, explained my problem and asked about another room -- and they moved me to another dorm room. The whole process took a few hours. Problem solved. I don't mean there are dozens of empty dorm rooms, but other people also move rooms. In my sophomore year, I lived in an apartment off campus with five upperclassmen who became great friends of mine. That was a life-changing experience. I had roommates in my three last years at Colgate who -- besides the basketball junkies -- became doctors (two of them), head of a genetics clinic, a psychologist, a federal public defender (lawyer), a mathematician, an archaeologist, a minister, and me, a teacher. Not bad. \n\nSometimes fixing problems in your life just takes some effort that you have to generate. That's what college is for. I don't mean to be inconsiderate about your child, but maybe college is where they learn to fix their problems themselves. I did all this myself, never involved my parents, and I'm kind of proud of that. As a long-term teacher, I can tell you that far too many parents today get far too involved where they shouldn't be. Students need to solve their problems themselves. Don't like drinking? Don't drink. Roommates are idiots? Don't hang out with them -- or change dorm rooms. Can't get into an organization you want to be a member of? Go talk to the Dean of Students about it -- or join another group. College goes by so fast, suddenly they'll graduating. Let them solve their own problems, and they'll be proud of themselves.\n\nAs for my extracurriculars, when a classmate started a competing campus newspaper (kind of cool, right?\"), I agreed to become a writer for it. It was called the \"Colgate News\" which later merged to create the new name on the remaining newsaper So sometimes things work out. \n\nI was pretty miserable freshman year. I disliked my two roommates, found the drinking culture more than I could handle and struggled academically. I did think of transferring to some urban school as if that would solve my problems. I doubt it would have, though. Jerks are everywhere -- in case you haven't noticed. I gradually made some great friends, joined a fraternity where I made more friends (it had the highest GPA on campus, so it was not a typical frat, believe me), and I got much more involved in my academic work. After awhile, I was pretty happy there, and when I graduated I was pretty pleased with myself. \n\nI've always been glad I didn't transfer. If I did, I'd have had to tell that story about a thousand times. And I knew it would come across as I \"didn't fit in\" or I was \"a loner\" or some such thing -- or worse, people would think I'd flunked out or something. My freshman grades were pretty bad, I have to admit, so that assumption would not have been so far off the mark. \n\nI suggest strongly, that he/she change dorm rooms. Don't drink. Have a few non-drinking friends stop by the dorm some Saturday night to just talk. That'll give some weight to a non-drinking alternative. It's not Colgate. If your'e stuck in a roomful of idiots, it gets tiring no matter where you are. Imagine if your child transfers and finds more drinking, more isolation, what do they do then?  If they have to put up with it for awhile, it's part of growing up. Freshman year goes by very very quickly, so you deal with each problem as well as you can, and then move on to the next stage of your life. Every year I was there, I was happier and more confident. That's likely to happen to your child, too. Good luck.",

            "comment": "As a white person, I cannot speak to the lived experience of Asian students on Colgate\u2019s campus. That said, if you want to read a record of events on campus, I recommend visiting [The Colgate Maroon-News](https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com) website. I was the editor-in-chief from 2017-2018, and we heavily covered an incident at the beginning of the Lunar New Year in which something racially charged was written on an Asian student\u2019s dorm white board. The university took this very seriously, as did the faculty and students, and this led to weeks of student-led outrage and faculty action. Unfortunately, college campuses have short memories - the students who call for change graduate, and it is hard to track institutional change. Perhaps reading recent campus news stories would be helpful, or even reaching out to some of the clubs on campus or even ALANA (Colgate's Africana, Latin, Asian, and Native American (ALANA) Cultural Center) to ask to speak to a current student. They should be happy to accommodate. You can find an ALANA representative email on the Colgate website. \n\nI hope I haven\u2019t worried you too much - I wanted to share the truth, as I experienced it. I know that a written, derogatory slur caused a lot of hurt on campus and it is my memory that the community rose up to support the students and faculty who were very hurt by this. Colgate continues to become more diverse, and I hope that an incident such as this would not happen in its current community. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you want more info. \n\nI was ED to Colgate (class of 2018) and am sure that, since my time there ended 5 years ago now, I am not giving to most up-to-date info. As written above, I recommend you ask ALANA to connect you to a student community leader who can speak with you about their personal experience. \n\nI loved Colgate, and think it has the potential to be an institution that lives up to its ideals. But it does sometimes fall short.",

            "comment": "Hopefully a current or recent student answers. You might go post something on college confidential (a few students and parents of students lurking there). My sense is that this will be a welcoming and open community to AAI folks. Only about 5% of the school is Asian but a very large population set of the students come from the coasts and mainly northeast so those are folks that in general are in more diverse areas and lean more progressive. I\u2019ve talked to folks that went to Colgate and they all loved it. My son got in ED1 as well. We are not Asian though so can\u2019t speak to that experience.",

            "comment": "Hi! First, congratulations on getting into Colgate! I attended Colgate, though graduated a number of years ago at this point. I grew up in the Bay Area, white, and attended a high school that did have a high percentage of Asian students, so while Colgate seemed less racially diverse to me, I think students were generally very accepting. Similar to what veeshla said, it has many students coming from coastal states. I think Colgate may be tougher if you\u2019re an international student. In all cases, no matter who you are, there are many wonderful student groups on campus to get involved in to get to know a range of people (sports clubs, outdoor education - highly recommend, creative/arts groups). Fraternities and sororities are certainly an option as well (you don\u2019t join those until sophomore year, so you have time to figure it out), great study abroad programs.",

            "comment": "My daughter is half-Japanese and went to Colgate somewhat recently, graduating in 2013. Oh, wait, that's now 10 years ago! Holy smokes!\n\nWell, anyway, she looks fairly Japanese and never once said she had any weird situations about race. She roomed for two or three years with a friend who is Black and another roommate who is Hispanic. If you live in areas where there are a lot of Asian-Americans, you'll find about 80-90% of the rest of the country pretty devoid of them. It's not different for Hispanic or Black students. Part of college, I'm sure you know, is getting out of your bubble or comfort zone and experiencing different things. I also went to Colgate, though many decades ago obviously, and I was from New York City at the time. I found Colgate very rural, small town, isolated, and a little hard to cope with compared to my suburban lifestyle. It took some adjusting. There's a lot of adjusting for most students who go off to most colleges in different kinds of places they're not used to, and part of that is racial, but the rest is cultural and so on, meaning very different environments. \n\nLarger and more urban universities probably enroll most Asian Americans because they're in areas where Asian-Americans already live, most not living in small towns or rural areas. So smaller colleges aren't going to have a high percentage of Asians -- or of any other ethnic or nationality group. It just goes with the territory given the location and size of such schools. \n\nMy daughter's high school was in Los Angeles and was maybe 25% Asian, so I'm sure she found it a big change, but she probably noticed more the far more dramatic difference of being in a small, rural town than anything else. You'll be fine. It's a pretty good place on the whole.",

I mean it\u2019s still an east coast school that\u2019s primarily white by demographic, but it seems like it\u2019s still a great experience. \n\nI will say a lot of that environment comes down to a lot of work that myself and my classmates did to host events, put on parties, etc. ASA and SACC were big components in making the more inclusive culture that exists now, and it started at a time when I was there. \n\nBack when I went there I was actually just one of a small handful of American born / raised Asian minorities, and in my case all of my Indian friends were from India. But we all came together and put on some really awesome events.",

    "postText": "I am going to be a senior in high school and was thinking about applying to Colgate in the fall. I'm a huge space dork, I was wondering if I could get some insight into Colgate's astrophysics programs. How intense are the courses? Do you hate your life and want to die as much as all other physics majors? Would you recommend Colgate for this major? Do they have a lot of hands-on learning opportunities?",

            "comment": "My major was astrogeophysics, which was similar to astrophysics, except with some of the higher level physics courses replaced with geology courses, and an option as to which department to write your thesis in. I would say that my path was much easier than physics, but i think its less so with Astrophysics. \n\nFrom where you're at, just make sure that if you get into Colgate, you take physics and astro year 1, and see if you like it. Physics is hard, but it has its rewards",

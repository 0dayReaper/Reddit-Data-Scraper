    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm planning to apply for RD at Colgate University. I'm an international student, with my family income less than $45,000 (around $6000), so I'd also apply for a financial aid, with work-and-study program.

            "comment": "Not sure why you \"need\" to know your chances before applying. No one really knows their chances before applying, though there is greater likelihood and less. Just no guarantees. Also, obviously none of the random and anonymous people who just happen to comment about admission to any college have any idea if someone will or will not be admitted. We are not admissions people. But I'll give it a shot.\n\nIf I were on the Admissions Committee, I'm sorry to say but I'm not sure I'd admit you. Maybe, though, so don't be too distressed. Why? Your overall grades, if I understand them correctly, are fairly poor. What happened in your junior and Senior years? Did you just stop studying? That will hurt your chances of admission. Your SAT scores suggest you're smart enough, about in the middle or slightly below the middle of Colgate students in standardized testing. Why don't you look this up? It's posted on Colgate's Admissions website. \n\nDid you take no AP or advanced courses at all? If so, that's not going to wow the Admissions people much. \n\nYour computer interests are excellent, including both your course grades in computer science and your computer extracurriculars. But this suggests a very narrow interest and narrow performance mainly in that one area. Colgate, as you'll know is a liberal arts college, not a technical training school. It requires a broad education and admits students who seem both interested and prepared to get one. I'm not sure there's much evidence you're that kind of student. You have a more narrow focus on computer science with little evidence of success elsewhere except the art and drawing interest (which is good to see), so I'd think Colgate would be unsure about you as an applicant. The volunteer work you've done is also very good, but again your academic interests and successes have been extremely focused in only one area. I'm wondering why you don't apply to more technically-focused or business-oriented colleges? Isn't that what you really want? Have you given that some thought? \n\nAlso in this list you give no reason at all why you'd even want to attend a liberal arts college or why you have an interest in Colgate. College admission is mutual, both parties need to want the other, but you say not a thing about Colgate's appeal to you. That seems quite odd. Not only does Colgate expect the study of history, science, languages, and a broad array of subjects, not just computers, it also wants enthusiastic students who want to be there very much. What attracts you to Colgate? The Admissions people are going to want to know that - especially about someone as narrowly focused as you are. \n\nI'm a three-generation (father and daughter) Colgate alum - FYI. Good luck with your college applications.",

The reason for the dip in my scores in 11th and 12th grade is because my father lost his job and we had a tough time managing our finances with the little money we had in savings. I didn't have money to buy books, or afford good tuitions, and I thought to focus on my internship more because it was a source of money and at that moment I thought it would be a right thing to do to support my family. \nApart from the other things at Colgate, I like their need-blind admissions, also I didn't find any technical school with a need-blind admission (probably I'm wrong, if you know any, please reply them it would be a great help). \nI've not taken AP exams due to the financial problem we had, but I can take them, please let me know if it is going to improve my application and take out the stress from my test scores. \n\nThanks again for your comment, I really appreciate you've taken time to read my post and comment. \ud83d\ude0a",

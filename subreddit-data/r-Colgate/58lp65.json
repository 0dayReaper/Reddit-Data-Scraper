    "postText": "Colgate is definitely a reach for me, but I'd like to know how slim my chances of getting in are. My school uses a 4.5 scale for GPA btw. \n\nAcademics:\nCurrently, I'm sitting at a 3.81 (High B+) unweighted. I have taken 3 AP Courses (1 Junior Year and 2 Senior, AP US 1 and 2 and AP French). My school doesn't have a lot of course options, as some courses don't even have AP options, just regular and honors. I've taken honors English from Soph-Senior Year, Accelerated Math Freshman-Junior Year (In Intro to Calc this year). I've taken French soph-senior year and took latin freshman and soph year. I have a few A+'s on my transcript, but mostly A's and B+'s. Have 2 C+'s from first semester junior year, but I got those up to an A and B+ for my second semester that year. I'm in National Honors Society, French Honors Society, have received academic honors throughout all years, placed top of my class on National French Exams in sophomore and junior year, and have an academic scholarship. Our school doesn't give class ranking, but I know that I am in the 30's in a class of about 190-210.\n\nTests:\nDefinitely one of my shortcomings, as I never took the time to really prepare, still kicking myself for it. I have a 1270 on the new SAT, and I hope to bring that up to 1350ish, or score at least 29 on the ACT, by the time I apply. Still need to take subject tests if they're that important.\n\nActivities:\nI have good volunteer work throughout freshman-junior year, and I'll be doing more this year. I've played ice hockey outside of school (travel teams) throughout all 4 years, and have played hockey at school freshman and senior year. Not expecting or wanting any athletic interest, but hockey is a big activity for me. I'm a member of the performing arts club, french club, car club, and I'm also a peer tutor. I'll be trying out for the golf team in the spring\n\nOthers:\nI'm a pretty strong writer, and I think I'll have a strong essay prepared along with the required supplements. My letters of rec should be very good, and I know a Colgate alumnus (not sure if an additional letter of rec from them would carry much weight)\n\n--\n\nObviously, I know that I'm probably not going to end up at Colgate or a school similar to it. I think I'm definitely above what would be considered \"well-rounded/good\" for most things, but everything may not be up to par for a school like this. There's obviously stats and things like that that I've referenced, but I figured I'd get some input from people who go to Colgate to get further insight. Thanks for any info that anyone gives!",

I'm not Jewish. My daughter recently graduated. She had Jewish friends. Yes, there is a Jewish presence. One source I looked at says 17%, but I'm pretty sure the university doesn't keep religious figures, so who knows? And religious statistics are notoriously unreliable since young people change their faith or don't want to talk about it or intentionally mis-report unlike with other statistics which are harder to fake (race, income, nationality, etc). There are Jewish religious groups, kosher food, and so on. Have you talked to anyone at the university or looked this up online? If it really matters to you, do that please.",

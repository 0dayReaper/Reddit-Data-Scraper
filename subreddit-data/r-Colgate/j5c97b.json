Those will be the students it prefers rather than anyone with \"just\" a very good GPA, and so on. Now that you've done all that hard work (!), I'd emphasize anything that makes you more than \"just\" a good student. These would be things like your ethnicity/race if you are a minority, being a foreign student, a musician, an artist, an athlete, being bilingual, working your way up from poverty or any other unusual life experiences, being a \"legacy\" (child of a Colgate alum), or any other things that make you stand out. On the whole, I'd say you stand a very good chance of being admitted even without any of this, but being more distinctive makes it more likely. You aren't a brain surgeon, are you?",

That's misleading. What happened was one of their sons attended the university (then named Madison U., as you say) and they were so happy they donated a great deal of money to it. In thanks, the trustees of Madison U. decided to change the university's name to Colgate. \n\nSimilar stories go with Stanford University (founded by a rich railroad baron), Vanderbilt U. (railroad money again), Carnegie-Mellon U. (a steel magnate who owned Carnegie Steel Company, and a banker), Rockefeller University (oil company), Duke (tobacco company), Brown (businessman Moses Brown), and many others. Even Harvard was named in honor of the man who donated his entire library to the school. This is pretty standard stuff. \n\nThe reason some people get chuckles about Colgate is that of all these companies whose founders donated money, it's just about the only one that still exists today, so people think it's funny. I guess if you're not very knowledgable about history, lots of things seem funny.",

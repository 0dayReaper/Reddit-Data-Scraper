    "postText": "1. Are you wearing flannel? If not you should get your hands on some. \nNote: If no flannel is accessible, any v-neck or Newspring shirt will do.\n\n2. Did you attend welcome week? If you did not meet any friends in welcome week, don't expect anyone to go out of their way to hang out with you.\n\n3. \"You should come to our bible study.\" \nEveryone knows being a Christian is hard work. Actually having a life  is not an option. You need to be in BCM, attend chapel, join every bible study you can, and never show any human emotion.\n\n4. Learn how to masturbate quietly and quickly. A Sam's card and a pack of lotion will do you some good because you will never get laid here....ever. \nNote: Bunk-bed should squeak no more than two times.\n\n5. If you think he's gay, don't bring it up to anyone. This is a Christian College, clearly the musical theater major in the half-shirt doesn't like cock.\n\n6. If you eat at FFT prepare to dedicate 30 min. of your day to violently shitting.\n\n7. If you are considering applying to AU and are worried about getting in, just know the AU is slightly more selective than the Burger King kids club.\n\n8. Spread your cheeks now because Reslife is prepared to turn you into its own personal finger puppet.",

They have gigantic pieces of fried chicken sometimes, and their grilled cheese is amazing. Can\u2019t say much for their chicken burger, but you won\u2019t starve while you\u2019re there, that\u2019s for sure. They should always have a salad bar, ice cream machine, and pizza station open.",

They always make sure to have a \u2018token POC\u2019 in every social media post but really diversity is completely lacking/non-existent. \n\nPeople are really boring generally. Haven\u2019t met many people with any sort of personality outside of being Christian, aside from art/band/drama kids. Even then, people just kind of keep to themselves and no one ventures out to include you really. Hope that helps.",

People are a lot more diverse and cooler than you think\nSecond, still 95% white. Ive seen a lot more diversity in the freshmen this year but its still mostly white and female lol\nIts a good school, especially if youre in the cyber or psych program, but the diversity is depressing",

If you agree to participate, you will complete a survey asking questions about your views on the Covid-19 vaccine and a short vaccine literacy assessment. The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete.  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed it, feel free to copy the link and send it to anyone else you know between the ages of 18-24 to take or share this post! Thank you so much for your time!! All response are greatly appreciated!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nHere\u2019s the link: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5iWT1ml6YZCeUAiPB6opDOfD7oDGn_kpzNLzpGtidbik8pg/viewform?usp=sf_link",

Transgender is not a gender, no I'm not being transphobic, I consider myself trans, it's that transgender has a lot of things that fall under that umbrella term. Nonbinary people are considered trans, and trans mtf, and trans ftm. If you absolutely had to differentiate between cisgender people and trans people, the options should have been male, female, trans mtf, trans ftm, nonbinary, and other.",

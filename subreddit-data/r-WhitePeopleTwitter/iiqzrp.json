Was able to buy or rent used textbooks for 10-25 bucks until graduation, except for a few odd cases where the textbook was new or the professor wrote it. \n\nThe point here is that the textbook market, like so many other parts of college life, is designed to squeeze every drop out of public college students who are already spending exhorbitant sums of money so they think \"well it's *only* another thousand a year for the meal plan/textbooks/unlimited access to the rec center...\"",

This is actually a point of study in applied political science/public policy/activism that I've worked with lately:\n\nWe aren't being overt about that problem because there's also an attack on academia in general and a big push to force people who are actually qualified to write those books out of teaching. This issue is absolutely on our list, but right now there's an uncomfortable trade off. We want experts teaching and putting pressure on them about textbooks is going to worsen the progress being made to use adjuncts and grad students as profs instead of PhD experts and trained higher ed professors. Which devalues the already criminally high tuitions that are justified by the expert-level of education students are supposed to recieve. There's just too many attacks on college education and college students to address all of them simultaneously. \n\n(Which I agree is utter bullshit, but unfortunately students, activists, and their lawyers can only do so much at once)",

It was also 23 years later that I acknowledged the violent nature of it - there was lots of blood. \n\nI share this because for 23 years I only acknowledged that I had been \u2018sexually assaulted\u2019, but I believed \u2018it was not a big deal, just a thing that happened to me\u2019. I also excused the man bc I believed it was my fault and he did not know how he was hurting me. Both common lies - I now know- that victims tell themselves. In the intervening 23 yrs I developed a smoking case of PTSD along with the trail of wreckage that PTSD so commonly leaves in lives. This includes a serious substance abuse problem. \n\nI am responsible for my life and all the scorched earth,but I want young women to know had I acknowledged that I was RAPED back when I was 23 and gotten help THEN, I could have saved myself an untold amount of pain.  Don\u2019t deny or excuse what happened to you... THAT WILL CONTINUE AND WORSEN THE HARM TO YOU. \n\nAnd to any man (or woman) who thinks that the pain and damage of rape stops when the rape stops: that is just be beginning. These men need to know that the person they raped is NEVER going to be the same again. You destroyed something precious in these women that too many never rebuild. \n\n(Can anyone tell I still have a ways to go on my recovery?)",

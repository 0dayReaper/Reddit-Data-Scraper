There are other ways they are preventing minorities from having representation, such as removing ballot drop boxes and closing poling places in areas where the population is mostly minorities. Closing MVDs in those same areas where the closest one is a couple hours away and passing voter ID laws is another. There is a reason they are all trying to outlaw mail in voting. If they had the numbers you are acting like they are they wouldn\u2019t be doing this. You can\u2019t just out organize voter suppression so it all needs to be fixed, but for fucks sake man look at the facts. People like you said this same shit about AZ and once we made it easier to vote here look at how we flipped.",

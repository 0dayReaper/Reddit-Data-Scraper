            "comment": "The problem with this type of academic analysis is it is a well written expression of what we already know.  It doesn't adequately call-out the consequential threat of violent factions terrorizing non-white, non-rich people or even civil war (incited by our unregulated militia).\n\nIt's a long way of saying and is consistent with the simple premise that  a well funded, growing, neo-Nazi movement is dominating American politics.\n\nThe real discussion now (we are long past hypotheticals) needs to be around concrete problems and concrete solutions. Take social media for example. They are culpable for nuturing Christian Nationalists and need to be held accountable like a gun manufacturer marketing to children. Or a drug dealer. There needs to be consequences. Maybe start by making them pay taxes.\n\nThis is just an example of course.  Hopefully, people don't misunderstand my point and gentle objection. It perfectly describes the abstractions driving a real world political crisis of American democracy.\n\nAll this supremacist bullshit from Trump and the far right wing is having a major and negative impact on quality of life in America. For everyone.",

Etc. \n\n\n\n\n\nSame as in post-nazi Germany, the issue isn\u2019t as simple as party members and the innocent brainwashed masses - it\u2019s a complex web of grey that allows atrocities to become government policy. \n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the place America is in now - unable to draw a distinction and so unable to get to grips with the problem. \n\n\n\n\n\nPopper\u2019s paradox of tolerance might do you well as a nation.",

Their supporter believe the obvious bad faith lies from GOP politicians and are unable to square what they are told to believe with reality. No it\u2019s not that trump committed a crime, it\u2019s that liberals want to punish him for nothing, but there\u2019s a reason Fox News and the GOP isn\u2019t talking about the actual facts of the case",

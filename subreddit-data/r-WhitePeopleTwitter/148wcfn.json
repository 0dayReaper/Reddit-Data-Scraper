I\u2019d file a two part motion for recusal right now. \n\n1. She was appointed by Trump, which meets the requirements for recusal. Unequivocally. \n\n2. If you had to read this far, remember the 2 ridiculous decisions she made in his prior case. Decisions that were, without exception, derided by the legal community. Decisions that were overturned by an all-GOP-appointed panel of judges, where news reports said her decisions were \u2018slammed\u2019. And then again on appeal.\n\nThat\u2019s like half a page, and 3 minutes of effort. Jack Smith, feel free to copy and paste.",

No other advanced society in the world would allow her to preside. They would force her to recuse herself. In no other advanced nation would an appointee be allowed to rule over who appointed them.

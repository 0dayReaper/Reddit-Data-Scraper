Three uniformed officers were posted outside the Lobby when they were threatened by the crowd. One member of the mob yelled, \"Fuck the Blue\" (blue being a reference to the police). One officer guarding the door told the others \"They're ready to roll\", and the three officers moved away from the barricaded door leading to the Speaker's Lobby. No longer impeded by police, one rioter, Zachary Jordan Alam, smashed a glass window in the door. Many lawmakers and staff were being evacuated by Capitol Police, but some were trapped in the House balcony.\n&gt;\n&gt;Babbitt, hoisted by two men, attempted to climb through the shattered window. She was then shot in the neck/shoulder by Capitol Police Lieutenant Michael Byrd and fell back among the other protesters. Babbitt had been warned not to proceed through the window: one witness recalled that \"A number of police and Secret Service were saying 'Get back! Get down! Get out of the way!'; [Babbitt] didn't heed the call.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;A Capitol Police emergency response team administered aid, and Babbitt was transported to Washington Hospital Center where she later died.\n&gt;\n&gt;After being cleared of wrongdoing, Byrd made his name public in an August 2021 interview for NBC News. He said his name had been previously revealed in right-wing media and online forums and that he had received racist (Byrd is African-American) and violent threats, causing him to remain in hiding for several months. Looking back on his January 6 experience, Byrd said: \"Once we barricaded the doors, we were essentially trapped where we were. There was no way to retreat. No other way to get out. If they get through that door, they're into the House chamber and upon the members of Congress.\" He stated that he had pulled the trigger as a \"last resort\" after the mob of protesters ignored his repeated orders to get back, and that he had no idea at that moment that Babbitt was unarmed and was a woman. Byrd commented: \"I know that day I saved countless lives. I know members of Congress, as well as my fellow officers and staff, were in jeopardy and in serious danger. And that's my job\".",

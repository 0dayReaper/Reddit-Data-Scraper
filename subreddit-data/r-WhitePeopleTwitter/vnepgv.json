It's stupid really, coz they are allowed to take out profits out of the tax money too. Most religious schools are cultish, indoctrinating its pupils and discriminating towards certain groups of people that may have something to do with their sex or sexuality... \n\nThis system comes from a neoliberal school reform from the 90's that has been reeking havoc on the Education system for 3 decades now. \n\nBut the Government does want to stop the establishment of new schools with a religious profile and eventuelly ban the current ones too. Well they do want to scrap the entire current education system regarding private schools.",

I manage a restaurant near the JFK assassination site, and they love our food apparently. I'll copy and paste a bit from a previous comment about the experience if anyone is interested: \n\n\nSo these guys have been coming to my restaurant every day for almost a week, usually wearing either JFK Qult gear, or MAGA/Trump paraphernalia. It has been sort of a surreal experience, so here is some stuff I've seen or overheard the past few days.\n\n\u2022They have asked numerous people, staff mostly, if they knew JFK was still alive.\n\n\u2022They have tried to convince 2 of my servers to quit their jobs, because a \"Global Reset\" is coming any day and they don't need money anymore. \n\n\u2022The guy with the JFK shirt on in the picture is very obviously the guy leading their little crew, but he always orders a to go order for some \"important person\" that he insists we make the dish look perfect for.\n\n\u2022They have been surprisingly friendly, and the main guy especially is very charismatic and chatty. They don't seem *too* crazy to my staff, but I am sure to warn everyone that they are unstable nutjobs and we should get them in and out with as little fuss as possible. \n\n\u2022They spend, on average, a little less than $200 for the six of them, and tip $20 on top of the 20% automatic gratuity. They have absolutely zero concern about how much they spend.\n\n\u2022I overheard the main guy say to another guest that Trump has gained weight recently, and he will need to slim down again once he's officially back in office. He said that Trump only gained the weight to make himself seem depressed so people don't see what he's really up to? I'm not sure, I was eavesdropping and it wasn't making much sense.\n\nThis is all I remember off the top of my head, but if I remember more I'll update. It seems like they will be in pretty frequently, so I'm sure there will be more. It's my first firsthand experience with Qanon, although I drive past JFK's assassination spot every day and see them out there frequently since last winter. I figured you all might enjoy my account.",

Right?\n\nIt's not fucking *easy* to just give away a human being that you created. It is a piece of you that. Maternal instinct is to fight for a child and do everything in your power to raise it and keep it safe, warm, and fed, and that instinct is *fierce*. Choosing to give that up voluntarily is up there on the list of the hardest decisions to make in the world, unique to a woman.",

IIRC it's about the Chevron deference - whether federal agencies have the authority to issue regulations that flesh out the statutory laws passed by the Congress or whether the courts should flesh out these laws themselves.

People get tangled up in articles and interpretations from non-professionals.\n\n2.It\u2019s also difficult for people to distinguish between \u201cright vs wrong/ personal belief\u201d conversations and objective scientific conversations based on what the data shows. People fall back on tribalism, clutch onto single factors that correlate with controversial issues while not realizing the world is complicated. \n\n3.Steve Levitt said their conclusions shouldn\u2019t influence policy. On one hand you could have pro-choicers saying \u201cthis is clear evidence that abortions reduce crime\u201d and pro-lifers saying \u201cthe trade off of unborn humans killed and those killed from crime isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d The objective take from the data is about the power of \u201cunwantedness\u201d has on children.\n\nThe interviewer pushed him to take a stance at the end, but it was refreshing to hear Levitt, who seems to be a super even-keeled dude, basically say \u201cthese facts are interesting and important, and let\u2019s continue to learn more about it.\u201d \n\nUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t take this approach and we\u2019re all prone to bias.",

Those were some that Levitt empirically argued didn\u2019t decrease crime for a variety of reasons.

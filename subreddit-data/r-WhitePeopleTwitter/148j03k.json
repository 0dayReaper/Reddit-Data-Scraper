The truth is Obama was just a milquetoast right winger who bailed out big business instead of the people they hurt, and needlessly crippled his own progressive policies pretending to think\\* this would get people on the right to \"cross the isle\" to support them. Biden is even further to the right than Obama was, he was Obama's running mate to appeal to more conservative voters after all.\n\nAll that said, yeah I have never and will never vote GOP in my life. And if the choice in a general election is between a milquetoast right winger and a full on fascist, which is what the GOP is now, you vote for the milquetoast right winger.\n\n\\*I give him the credit that I don't think he was dumb enough to actually believe any of his rhetoric about \"making compromises to appease republicans\" and just used that as an excuse for right wing things he wanted to do anyway.",

Benghazi there were definitely some failures, to name one, but of course any scandal, true or stretching the credulity, got milked to death to the point we're numb to it. We really need to start having proper responses to this type of stuff. Dunking on Trump for the toilet paper incident, altering that map or cofveve or whatever it was is pretty small potatoes considering what he's actually done. \n\nAnd just to be clear I'm not saying Obama did Benghazi or anything like that, just calling attention to an actual scandal which sadly got memed to death thanks to becoming a dead horse. Hell I'd argue because of the circus around it some actual investigations into the failures that led to the tragedy may have gotten fowled up.",

R's that would now be a breathe of fresh air to many of us at least in the way that they aren't these fucking psychos we have now.\n\nWhen Obama said \"that could have been my own son\" to the news about Trayvon Martin getting profiled and hunted down by Zimmerman which resulted in Trayvon's death, republicans went batshit and said that \"Obama's statement was too divisive.\"\n\nImagine a president showing empathy for a murdered teenager being called \"divisive\".\n\nAll because a black man was elected they threw the biggest hissy fit in recent us political history, outside of Jan6.",

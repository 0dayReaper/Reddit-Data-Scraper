Don't get me wrong, there is certainly a lot that can happen between reported income before income taxes and what is technically taxable income, but there aren't that many major American domiciled companies outside of tech that are paying an effective rate below 15% that I run into.\n\nAnd the reason why so many large tech companies pay no taxes is because investors have allowed them to eat losses for a generation and accrue a wall of NOLs which they are still burning through (and a lot of companies produced some during COVID).\n\nThis law still allows for NOLs against the minimum rate calculation and R&amp;D credits which are the two primary \"below the line\" shields I see the most of. And frankly it should, as, as much as I love shitting on perpetually cash burning tech bullshit, having the tax code structured in such a way is material contributor to the American innovation economy.",

In my low 30s, I am starting to draw connections between policies and events I heard in passing as a kid, and realizing their impact today as an adult. Also starting to see why people say *history doesn't repeat but it rhymes*.\n\nLooking at all the displaced Ukrainians children today takes me back to grade school when we had new students who had just moved from the likes of Bosnia and Serbia - at the time I had no concept the war and historical events taking place that day, just the friendships I was making.\n\nWeirdest realization so far has been that one can draw a line from WoW gold farming directly to Trump becoming president via Steve Bannon and IGE - I would have never thought when I was busy wiping in Molten Core and failing trigonometry that gold farmers would eventually lead to troll farms and social media manipulation.",

But they get A LOT more safety nets. \n\nThe only point I will begrudgingly concede is that the US is vastly larger than Norway in size and population. And given the states are largely responsible for the spending of federal dollars given to them, it feels like a logistical nightmare to set up a system. The only one I can think of that might not be too terrible is to transition all state employees responsible for approval and distribution of social programs to federal employees. This takes the issue out of local hands, hopefully de-politicizing basic human rights. It's a pipedream, but if we're wishing for stuff, may as well wish big!",

They\u2019re just hoarding it. \n\nThere was a time when the highest interest rate on their wealth was 90%. And, because of that, it didn\u2019t make sense to hoard it. Why hoard it when you\u2019ll have to give 90% of it away? So instead, they invested back into the business, spent it on R&amp;D that may or may not have any reward, but at least they weren\u2019t giving it away in taxes. \n\nThey spent it on infrastructure and wages, they hired employees and invested in technology, because the alternative was to lose 90% of it to taxes. The risk of losing money on expansion was lower than the certain risk of 90% taxation.\n\nAnd then Reagan came along, chopped the shit out of the tax rate, and it almost immediately became more profitable to just hoard it. What they lose in taxes, they gain back in interest on what they save. \n\nThe risk of failed R&amp;D became greater than the tax burden, so they stuck to small, incremental R&amp;D that made slight improvements to existing products that they could turn into new patents and create planned obsolescence of the old patents. \n\nThe whole point of the low tax rate was to encourage hoarding, and discourage investment back into the company, the employees, and the products. And, when that was no longer enough, they looked for new ways to hoard more. First by moving production to Mexico, then China and India, and then by reducing the remaining workforce and requiring more productivity from fewer people. \n\nWhat they\u2019re doing with it is exactly what they\u2019re incentivized to do with it!

He said if billionaires aren\u2019t willing to reform capitalism, the \u201cpitchforks are coming\u201d and it won\u2019t end well for them. \n\nObviously nothing changed, and they used the ensuing pandemic as a cash grab to [transfer trillions more wealth](https://www.newsweek.com/were-living-through-greatest-transfer-wealth-middle-class-elites-history-opinion-1641614). And then the CEO of Blackrock complained of an \u201c[entitled generation](https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-hurt-entitled-generation-warns-blackrock-president-millennials-boomer-genx-2022-3)\u201d that\u2019s never had to sacrifice before.\n\nBut, hey, at least they were warned before we start carting out the guillotines.

But when they learn similarly high tax rates were successful under one of the most respected recent republicans, it appeals to more people. It's not an idea exclusive to far left figures, any politician that wants to bring back a strong middle class should be on board with this. \n\nReagan really killed the middle class with reaganomics, it's such a shame that Republicans in the 50s were more common sense with their tax rates than the Democrats in 2023.",

Part of your brain just fills in the surrounding content without notifying you. \n\nHowever, that's just the defect that's common to all humans. Everyone has weird distortions in their retina that are basically impossible to detect, because your brain's learned how to compensate for them since you were born. \n\nBut I imagine that if you're in the right state of mind (potentially with the help of mind-altering chemicals) you could turn off some of that mental interpolation - which would probably result in things looking like \"rendering errors\".",

Second, there are still a ton of people who are very much anti weed despite what good it can do for people. \n\nThe NFLs main concern is not to take a stance, but to make money. And while they may make a ton from the burgeoning business of cannabis, the optics of airing such an ad may cause too much backlash to be worth it. Not saying this is right, but at least it gives context to why they would make that call.",

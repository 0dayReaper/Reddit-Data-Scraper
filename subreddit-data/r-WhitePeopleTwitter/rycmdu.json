I think the whole reason is because I only have one kid of school age and because she's 5 my wife and I don't have a hard time with the homeschool curriculum. We planned on getting her in school this month since she got her second vax at the end of November. Watching people dropping like flies after the Thanksgiving spike hit really made us rethink that move. Crossing our fingers she'll start first grade in person next fall. Of course, my employer shuttered in-person work officially starting this coming Monday. I didn't work in person this week but that's because my office had a mass breakout and my division staff was cut by 70%. Luckily not a single person ended up hospitalized, my work mandates vaccine for employment, but we basically put a hard stop on all secondary projects until mid month because we don't have enough people to work on anything nonessential.",

I\u2019m running out of the ability to work remotely, I already had to change jobs twice and people just won\u2019t hire you to start remote. To say nothing of her quality of life if she hast to keep an isolation like this. I moved her in with me so that we could have time together and that she wouldn\u2019t be alone. I don\u2019t want to her to spend her last years locked away in total isolation from everyone.\n\nObviously I want to get more information and try to make a better guess of what her odds of survival are, but every immunologist and rheumatologist is just so incredibly booked out because they\u2019re on the front lines of this pandemic. Not to mention it\u2019s a lot more risk every time she goes in for more tests. They won\u2019t even talk to us to try to advise a course of action. Insurance won\u2019t do shit without a diagnosis and her PCP already said it\u2019s definitely in the very rate and likely undiagnosable category since it\u2019s too aggressive for the more common ones like lupus. \n\nWhenever I see people so callously talking about how we need to \u201cmove on\u201d and \u201cjust let it run its course\u201d I feel like they\u2019re talking about sacrificing my mother so that they can go back to their Starbucks and haircuts.",

Especially irks me when they think they will get it and then somehow that's gonna be it. The last 2 years have proven that not to be the case at all. You don't have magical immunity and yet these idiots believe that. And frankly, yes the vaccine helps greatly in preventing death and severe symptoms, but we don't know what the longterm consequences of covid are on the body. I'd rather not get it at all thank you very much.",

I can smell a bit, but it has to be in large quantities and right up to my nose) as well as some of the worst fevers I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nI was 30 when I caught it and in decent health. Bit overweight but I was going to the gym at the time. I haven\u2019t been back and with the surges, will just be working out at home from now on. We caught it from a friend, that got it from his wife who was pregnant at the time vaccines were available. \n\nI\u2019m boosted now, so hopefully if I do get it, it won\u2019t be as bad, but it was terrifying to have my heart racing that bad from merely standing up.",

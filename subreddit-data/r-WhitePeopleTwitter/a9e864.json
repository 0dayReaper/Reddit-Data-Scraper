Not to mention the hours he put in on Christmas day setting any presents up! He went above and beyond for the Christmas magic, which is why Im shocked to see these memes about Dads not buying presents. I only hope I can be half as good as Santa as my Dad was for me and my brother.\n\nYour comment made me really happy to see and you sound like a fantastic Dad. Merry Christmas!",

She appreciated it in the end so it was a good team moment. ",

I can't imagine him finding enough gullible MAGA-type people in a foreign country.\n\nBasically if he runs away, his brand name, the source of all his wealth and power, suffers and suddenly he's not just a moderately rich guy, but his followers might desert him over this show of weakness. He loses all his money and property in any European Country and the US. No more Scottish golf courses.\n\nPlus he can still run for President in the US from prison, and get elected President in the US from prison, and pardon his federal crimes, then bribe all the state governors for pardons or the most lenient work release programs ever. **Then he'd be the MAGA Freedom Fighter, beaten down by the system but rising up from the ashes.** The massive increase to his brand from all that would be worth all the relatively brief interaction with the prison system.\n\nSure, if he's not elected president, put him in lockdown for the rest of his life, because the first chance he gets he's on that plane to Russia with his bugout bag of money and documents. But I think he thinks being elected President from prison would be better than trying to convince the Russians to like him.",

Anyone that helped him flee would be an held accountable. Banishment and destruction of his money seems like a good deal here. If he stays I can't see him getting much more than an ankle bracelet at mar a lago because of \"security concerns\" in the prison system. Let him enjoy his time in Russia. I'm sure once he pisses someone off there they will find a window for him to fall out of.",

Best thing to do is just figure out what he took and change whatever we can. He had them in a bathroom with a copy machine, locking him up ain't gonna change the fact that he already sold that shit. Also, I mean, If i actually believed they would lock him up I'd think differently but I don't have enough faith that he wouldn't just end up chilling at mar a lago ranting to whoever will listen that it's the greatest travesty of justice that he is stuck there with an ankle monitor.",

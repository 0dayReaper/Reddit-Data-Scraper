The solution \u2014 containing the animals\u2019 blood and 13 compounds such as anticoagulants \u2014 slowed the decomposition of the bodies and quickly restored some organ function, such as heart contraction and activity in the liver and kidneys. Although OrganEx helped to preserve the integrity of some brain tissue, researchers did not observe any coordinated brain activity that would indicate the animals had regained any consciousness or sentience.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02112-0",

He also asked Judge Roger Young to take into consideration Turner's \"young age \\[and\\] his lack of a prior record before pleading to these charges.\"\"\n\n... Lack of prior record.. you mean the multiple arrests, state Senator Brad Hutto representing him in the 3rd case, and the fact that one of his victims killed herself... that missing prior record?  Turnblad apparently went to the same kraken school of lawyering....\n\nSorry, if you're 19 and have already done this much, I'm very sorry to say that I do not believe you would be worth saving.  I love redemption arcs, but it seems the Rapey Turners are incorrigible pieces of shit.",

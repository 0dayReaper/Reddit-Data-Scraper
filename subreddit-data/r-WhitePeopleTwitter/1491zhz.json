They were allied with Germany before then, and had plans on how to divide up Europe in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. What Nazi Germany was doing was fine to the USSR, right up until they were betrayed. \nSo the actual political ideology of Nazism is fine in Russia, it's the fact the Nazis attacked them.",

You will receive a handsome monthly salary (Cantwell's salary will be partially or fully withheld and stolen by those higher in the chain of command)\n\n2. You will be well equipped (Cantwell will get practically nothing. He and his family will have to spend their own money buying equipment &amp; supplies online and at inflated prices - items stolen from military inventory and put online for profit)\n\n3. You will perform guard duties in Belgorod or dig trenches well behind the front lines (Cantwell and his comrades will have their military documents and mobile phones confiscated, be taken by truck and dumped on the front line, and left to fend for themselves. Any retreat will lead to either imprisonment or a bullet. Imprisonment leads to forced recruitment in Wagner PMC or the Russian MoD's Z-Force)\n\n4. If you don't fight the (Ukrainians) will fuck you over (Cantwell will learn the hard way about Russian military hazing. He will know what it's like to be held down and sodomised)\n\n5. If you die or are seriously wounded, you or your family will be handsomely compensated (in case of Cantwell's death, he will be declared missing or AWOL, and his family will be denied compensation. In case of serious injury, it will be downplayed, so Cantwell can be returned to the frontline. Otherwise, Cantwell will be given the bureaucratic runaround and denied compensation, all without knowing someone in the system claimed it on his behalf and stole it)\n\n1 - 5 are all Russian \"truths\" with verified examples of what those \"truths\" often really mean.",

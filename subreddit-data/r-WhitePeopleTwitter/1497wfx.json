Biden won by a solid margin because of high turnout and because some Republicans (who voted Republican down-ballot) refused to vote for him [Ron Johnson (!) made this exact point]. \n\nUnless Trump can either 1) make himself more appealing outside his core support (\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude02)  or 2) the Dems don't show up to vote/are suppressed in 2024 (\ud83d\ude21) , there isn't much of a path to victory for Trump. \n\nI'm more concerned he'll have a heart attack and a \"less toxic\" second-rank Trump wanna-be is the candidate... \n\nPersonally, I've warmed up to Biden. Sure he's old, but damn it, the man keeps on pulling rabbits out of the political hat!",

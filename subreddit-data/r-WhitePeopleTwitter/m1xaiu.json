The more I read about her, the more calculating and aware she seems. I think she caught on fairly quickly to how things were going to be and started to forge her own path. Her charity work really stepped up in the mid to late-80's (the AIDS patient thing was 87), and I think that was when she realized it wouldn't ever be a fairly tale life, and she had an opportunity to do something herself. And then she started using the institution as much as it used her.",

I respect her in the way I\u2019d respect anyone that\u2019s worked all the way into their nineties, but her rigid way of thinking has caused a lot of unnecessary suffering for a lot of people. I think it\u2019s funny that she does it to protect the reputation of the monarchy when it\u2019s almost certainly done more harm than good in the grand scheme of things. Just about every scandal they\u2019ve encountered in the modern era can be traced back to the palace being heartless in the name of \u201cprotecting the monarchy\u201d.\n\nIn the olden days, I believe the wife of the future king was expected to be a virgin mainly to ensure the paternity of any children they would later have together. They didn\u2019t want to risk the future king marrying someone who was already pregnant with another man\u2019s child or any power struggles that would ensue if she already had children when they married.",

I think the Windsors took the abdication crisis pretty seriously and swore off marrying divorced people (until Harry)\n\nBut yeah doesn't make much sense when Henry VIII created the bloody thing for the sole purpose of divorce",

Correct me where needed.\n\nSo Harry and Meghan went on Oprah and the big take away was someone from the royal family was worried about how dark their baby would be.\n\nHarry is Princess Diana's son. The death of Diana has always been kind of mysterious. She divorced Prince Charles (Queen Elizabeth's son) and was rumored to be dating Dodi Fayed (a well off Egyptian filmmaker, or if you're a royal you can replace this with \"brown guy\"). Thus perhaps she and him were purposefully killed in that 1997 crash because the royals didn't want to taint the bloodline I guess.\n\nIt's all conspiracy as of now though.\n\nBut the original post here is basically saying he likes that Diana's son also is married to a woman of color just to stick it to the royal family.",

The crowd would literally cry tears of joy when Oprah had the big reveal what the episode was. My mom's guest was my grandma who didn't drive so instead of being on the episode where the biggest ticket item was a smart car (for each person), it was 2 tickets for a weeklong cruise on the biggest cruise ship in the world at the time.\n\nAbsolutely fucking nuts, so exponentially higher than audiences getting normally getting things ranging from books to concert tickets. I'm not even trying to flex here, that word 'Institution' just really resonated with me. I flexed enough at the time when middle school me heard the news.\n\nBefore anyone rightfully criticizes the cruise for being a petri dish, it was literally perfect for us, being a vacation for us going with my grandmother who wasn't very mobile. If we got any vacation package we'd have mostly stayed at the hotel for her. Ship was so big though we had the wheelchair for her as opposed to her using her walker. I was very close with her and that's the only vacation we ever went on with her so I remember it so fondly. Among the things they got were $500 Nike gift cards and she talked about NIKEID - where you could design the custom shoes. My grandma got a pair of like rainbow Nikes with THX, OPRAH on the tongues. All her girlfriends loved them as they'd never seen anything like them.\n\nAs you can tell I am really appreciative of Oprah and the institution of a show her show really was.\nI could've probably done that a simpler but I like being detailed.",

My dad was a casual racist my whole life, nothing changed him, until I got pregnant with my son. He finally realized that every \"funny\" joke he made, it could apply to his grandson &amp; it wasn't so funny anymore. It's sad that a poor, conservative, redneck is more willing to change, than someone whose supposed to be a king.",

The Palace refused to let her get help because it would reflect badly on them. The Palace also refused to stand up for her in the press, even ignoring deliberate disinformation that tried to assassinate her character. Instead they opened up an investigation into claims that she bullied her staff.\n\nHarry basically said \"Fuck y'all, my wife doesn't deserve this treatment\" and started stepping back from his family and royal duties and moved to North America. \n\nIn response the Palace completely cut him off financially and he lives off his mother's inheritance, which would seen like a lot but the Palace also refuses to supply him and his family any security forces, which is expensive and necessary. He'll always be royal connected and therefore at risk for threats and kidnappers, and his wife is especially vulnerable because she's hated by racists and conservative Royal supporters. He can't just buy a cheap house in the suburbs and call it a day. \n\nThe British family has been demonstrably racist since, well ever. Harry himself has made tone deaf racist comments/actions in the past, including referring to a fellow soldier as a Paki (Pakistani) and wearing a Nazi uniform to a party. But he said his wife's treatments opened his eyes to racial injustice he never realized was there.",

Then he abdicated, stepping down. He did so to marry a divorced American Socialite. \n\nSo George stepped up with little preparation. If I remember right, this was around when the Queen was a preteen. So immediately, once it was clear she was next in line her studies changed to prepare her for the throne. \n\nAnd as well all know this was around the world wars and such. Her father died earlier than expect and Elizabeth was Queen in her early 20\u2019s just after WWII had ended.\n\nElizabeth\u2019s little sister Margaret fell in love with a married man. He did eventually divorce his wife and wanted to marry Margaret. But Elizabeth forbid it. \n\nSo marring divorced people has been a hot topic in their past. However, you\u2019d think that since Charles and Diana divorced, you would think the family had moved on. But I think you or someone else was right. Camilla and Charles must be bitter and behind this. Repeating the same crusade against Meghan as they did to Diana.",

Charles was still in love with his ex, Camilla, but allowed himself to be pushed into the marriage to Diana anyways despite being considerably older than her. He basically just stayed sleeping with his ex the whole marriage and treated Diana like shit the entire marriage to the point that she was suicidal. She went to the Queen and other royals for help but they shrugged her off and told her to deal with it because they already didn\u2019t like her for having the people\u2019s favor. Diana wasn\u2019t even allowed to get a divorce despite her and Charles living separately. She eventually did a big interview exposing the truth to the public and was finally granted her divorce. However, the Queen stripped her of her titles and cut her off from the royals security and etc which left Diana vulnerable. She couldn\u2019t take vacations with her children or go anywhere without being constantly hounded by the press. That, of course, led to her death at the hands of the paparazzi. The Queen didn\u2019t even do anything to like publicly mourn her death until their was a public outcry about it iirc.",

Her uncle Edward was king. Then he abdicated, stepping down. He did so to marry a divorced American Socialite.\n\nSo George stepped up with little preparation. If I remember right, this was around when the Queen was a preteen. So immediately, once it was clear she was next in line her studies changed to prepare her for the throne.\n\nAnd as well all know this was around the world wars and such. Her father died earlier than expect and Elizabeth was Queen in her early 20\u2019s just after WWII had ended.\n\nElizabeth\u2019s little sister Margaret fell in love with a married man. He did eventually divorce his wife and wanted to marry Margaret. But Elizabeth forbid it.\n\nSo marring divorced people has been a hot topic in their past. However, you\u2019d think that since Charles and Diana divorced, you would think the family had moved on. But I think you or someone else was right. Camilla and Charles must be bitter and behind this. Repeating the same crusade against Meghan as they did to Diana.",

Must have started with my stepmother.  I'm also a pasty redhead like Harry, so you might see where this story is going.\n\nThat's not to say I have tunnel vision.  I've dated all types of birds; my last girlfriend was of the Asian stock, and she was more than I could ever ask for.  I had this Resident Evil fantasy.  She'd don a blonde wig and an orange sweater, but I'd tell her to get lost.  Then she would remove the wig, quickly slip into a red cocktail dress and proceed to fuck my brains out.  God, she was amazing.  I didn't deserve her, and she didn't deserve what I did to her.\n\nI hadn't paid much attention to royal family matters.  But my girlfriend was excited for the next royal wedding and asked if I would get up early to watch it with her.  She dangled a black holster in front of me - a new accessory.  Of course I said yes.\n\nFive a.m. rolled around and we were already seated at the couch.  But when I saw Meagan and Harry, my chasmic desires rose to the surface.  I couldn't sit still.  My girlfriend was suspicious, but I genuinely couldn't help myself; halfway through the matrimony, I made a mad dash to the bathroom.  Later, my flaccid penis betrayed what had happened when I impotently tried to fuck her.\n\nFrom that moment forward, I gave up masturbation.  Whatever sweet, forbidden fruit would appear before my mind's eye, I will resist the urge to bite.  My relationship skills have improved greatly since the \"incident.\"  I'm with a new girl (Hi Dana!) and we just bought a dog.  I couldn't be happier.\n\nAnyway, it says a lot about the royal family when Harry gets cut off but Andrew the child molester gets a slap on the wrist\n\nedit: fixed a typo. thanks, u/luigispikachu",

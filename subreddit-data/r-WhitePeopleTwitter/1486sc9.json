They'd only be invalid if the satire was *only* satire. When you make 1:1 satire of something that unironically happens, it just means you have a poor grasp of satire, or that the joke is outdated. The satire is supposed to be an exaggerated mockery, not a true crimes episode.\n\nAnd the unfortunate reality is that 'exaggerated mockery' of today's anti-worker culture is a 4-panel comic about a boss performing fucking necromancy to pull you out of the ground, because necromancy isn't real, and they've already *done* everything short of literally reviving you from the dead to exploit you.",

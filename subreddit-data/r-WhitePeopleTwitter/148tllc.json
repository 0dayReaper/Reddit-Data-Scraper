Or better yet, if he would have allowed the National Archives to handle the contents of his office upon his LOSING the election, he wouldn't be in court right now.\n\nBut no, Don decided he could do whatever he wanted with whatever he wanted to keep and completely ignored the Presidential Records Act and is now suffering the consequences of a bill he signed into law stiffening the penalties for mishandling classified documents.\n\nMy God, MAGA Republicans are stupid.",

Some of her storage was sanitized. This is a thing that the GOP would love to assign nefarious intent to, but cannot, because it's both reasonable and even responsible. If some devices or their records were destroyed, again the issue returns to intent: was it to prevent unauthorized disclosure, or to cover up wrongdoing?

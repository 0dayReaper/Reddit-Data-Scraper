Secondly, while according to the flag code when hanging like that no flag is supposed to be to the right of the American flag as there is a second American flag to the right of the Progress Pride flag that makes up for the Progress Pride flag being to the right of the first American flag IMO. Thirdly, there's a huge American flag flying from a staff directly above these flags, a flag that right wingers like this are intentionally leaving out of the picture to drive outrage. I've even seen pictures where you can see the sky above and the pole of the main flag edited out.\n\nIf the Progress Pride flag was flying over the American flag or in place of it I could understand people being upset at the clear violation of the flag code but this isn't that.",

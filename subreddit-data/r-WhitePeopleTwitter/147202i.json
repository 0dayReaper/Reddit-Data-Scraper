    "postText": "[Reddit is killing third party apps (and itself), read more linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/147efbl/reddit_is_killing_thirdparty_applications_and/)\n\n---------------\n\nIf you're only interested in how WPT participates and not in our motivation, please scroll to the bottom, where I write \"starting today\".\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHello everyone,\n\n[Anyone who has been on the reddit front page for the past few weeks will have seen threads about the changes reddit is making to how users, offsite interested parties and third party applications may access their API.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) \n\nReddit is altering their terms of use so they can move towards a revenue-generating model with regards to API access. \n\nWhile as a business they certainly have every right to do so, many people believe that the way in which these changes are implemented have been.. unfortunate, to say the least. \n\nI am not going to get into the meat of that here. Other people have done so far better and with far more insight and specialist knowledge than I am able to.\n\nBut I will highlight this one specific interaction between reddit and a bot operator which I believe is a perfect showcase of reddit mishandeling this situation:\n\n[Reddit says that non-commercial bots may continue to use the API for free, but it  appears to approach what constitutes \"non-commercial\" far more rigidly and non-compromising than is reasonable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/crochet/comments/1462ze1/reddit_api_and_ravbot/) \n\nHere at WhitePeopleTwitter we believe that reddit has uniquely evolved to facilitate and foster communities of people banding together for a common goal, interest, belief or identity. We love this about the place. We want to see these disparate, quixotic, wonderful, useful and at times critically important communities thrive. \n\nSometimes people have difficulty talking about who they are, what they believe, have difficulty connecting to peers and reddit facilitates many spaces where they can have a true sense of community. We want to see this continue. \n\nPlaces like r/LGBT, r/TwoXChromosomes, r/Witchesvspatriarchy provide a real home where people congregate, find support and connect in a way they may have difficulty doing in their home environment. Spaces like r/suicidewatch literally save lives. Reddit has real societal value here. This isn't just horsing around online, the internet is  life and these communities matter. \n\nOf course all the non-serious, memeing, silly and weird spaces have value too. From r/catsstandingup to r/breadstapledtotrees to r/garlicbreadmemes, reddit is a place to have fun. Reddit is a space where you can take an inside joke and turn it into a successful subreddit where people just come to brighten their day for years on end sharing joy and bonding over something silly. \n\nI keep coming back to communities because I believe communities matter. In a few short decades the scope of the net we cast when looking for likeminded peers has gone from very limited to global. As a society we are still adapting to how to deal with that. The internet is something wonderful, something terrible, something silly and something great. It can be used to push people towards a more depressing future as we have seen with[ Brexit](https://www.referendumanalysis.uk/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-7-social-media/impact-of-social-media-on-the-outcome-of-the-eu-referendum/) but it can also be used to organise a more [positive change](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Twitter-Played-Pivotal-Role-in-Arab-Spring-amounting-to-more-than-two-million-tweets-a_fig5_234040341) \n\nReddit is a business and a business's primary goal is making money. This is understood and it is not something I object to. But I also believe that in the current emerging global community a business that exists to on an emergent level facilitate the blossoming, continued existence and growth of communities that have real value to people and a tangible effect on events both on a local and global level a company like reddit has a responsibility to make sure that these communities can prosper. \n\nI do not believe that reddit is handling its current move towards a more proprietary iteration of its product with the  grace, equanimity  and elegance and kindness it can certainly afford to give us.\n\nr/Blind is a thriving, fourteen year old community that a few weeks ago was told, out of the blue, that within a month's time it would effectively cease to exist because reddit would no longer allow third party apps necessary for screenreaders to operate on reddit continued access in a way they could afford. The blind community online appeared to be an afterthought, not included in their own analysis of the effects the API changes would have on their site. This should not have happened. Reddit is currently in dialogue with this community so that their survival can be guaranteed, but this should have been done before the announcement.\n\nIn communication with the wonderful user-facing administration teams on reddit the people who build and maintain communities on reddit have been given strong guarantees that we would continue to have access to the API for moderation, research and community-building purposes. But, as I showed in my example above, reddit still views what is and what is not commercial access rather strictly.  I have nothing but praise for the people who went hours over planned time in meetings with hundreds of us community builders so that everyone who had a concern could be given a voice. I can not express strongly enough to what degree these people care just as much as we do about the spaces we built on reddit and their dedication to the people who value them, who see them as a way to connect, as a part of their identity. \n\nBut, these user-facing admin teams, the community admins, the developer admins and everyone else are not the ones making the final decisions. They are helping us, they are going to bat for us but in the end it is the management tier that calls the shots.\n\nAnd the management tier I do not believe is fully in sync with the atmosphere on reddit, with the general belief that a good, valuable collection of spaces online is being harmed. After the meeting I mentioned above there was tentative goodwill and the idea that there was light at the end of the tunnel. The AMA with reddit's CEO mr. Huffman (Spez) then could not have done a better job of[ applying a flamethrower](https://imgur.com/a/ysg7WSh) to that sentiment. \n\nCommunities matter. We want to see reddit thrive. We believe that reddit has real value as a space where people find a connection, find entertainment, find ways to improve themselves and ways to uplift themselves. We would like to see a continued dialogue between reddit and its userbase so that new roads can be found which will facilitate this vibrant, worldwide collection of weird, wonderful, brilliant and beautiful people. \n\nFrom memes about cats to walkthroughs for games, from recipes for a perfect funnel cake to the comfort of those who understand what it is like to feel the way you do.\n\nCommunities matter. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nStarting today, WhitePeopleTwitter will join in solidarity with a large section of reddit in highlighting the effect on our spaces of the new terms of service for reddit's API.\n\nUnlike many other subreddits we will not go private.\n\nWe will instead severely restrict commenting on this subreddit by setting all new threads to \"Clubhouse participants only\". Additionally we will increase the threshold for access to WhitePeopleTwitter's Clubhouse greatly. Clubhouse mode is something we normally apply to contentious threads we want to reserve for regular, constructive members of this subreddit, similar to how BPT and WitchesvsPatriarchy have threads only their regulars can comment in. We do not hand out entry on request. The vast majority of redditors will not be able to comment on our threads. \n\nIn doing so we will highlight the way we believe the upcoming changes will negatively affect the way people converse, bond and connect on reddit. \n\nWe hope that continued, constructive dialogue between reddit, its users and its community builders can lead to a better  way reddit acknowledges and respects that it is the communities that make it the success that it is. We have all built these spaces. We have all tended to them, we have all contributed. We would like to see reddit's upper echelons acknowledge the importance of its userbase to the success of its business venture. \n\n\n\n---------------------\n----------------------\n\n[A very well-made and poignant critique, made with skill and style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJrQBiTudzs&amp;feature=youtu.be)",

Especially third party developers who (no matter how honorable) really don\u2019t have any right to make demands on a product they didn\u2019t create, don\u2019t maintain, and have zero responsibility. \n\nI mean, as a software developer myself - if I ever created a company and product, I would want and expect to have full control and autonomy over any decisions for that product. \n\nAnd like, I see it posted so many times that if someone has a problem with a particular subreddit they have the freedom to go create their own (which I fully agree). Well, if someone had a problem with a company and product I created - I\u2019d probably suggest for them to simply go create their own too. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s just really hard for me to fault Reddit too much on this particular issue (even if I do fault them for many other things).\n\nBut you know what really bugs me (and far more than a fight over revenue and profits)?\n\nWhy am I and millions of others being held hostage and penalized for something which would otherwise have zero impact on how we use and interact with this site and go about our daily lives.\n\nLook - I have doubts about how a few days of protesting changes and subreddit access (or interactions) being temporarily removed is going to accomplish much on this issue - but I understand it is out of my power and many of those with power are very passionate about this. \n\nAnd ultimately - I\u2019ll survive any blackouts or access issues. In the end it is a very small sacrifice compared to real world issues. \n\nBut what I am truly and most upset about in all of this is how so many of us are being held hostage and used as pawns over this issue and without our consent.",

So I don't personally see the point in it, other than as a way for the protesters to express their displeasure.",

Indeed, there are some very real financial issues which maybe threaten the very existence of Reddit (either now or in the future).\n\nWhile there are limits to how much commercialization and bullshit I will accept, I\u2019d prefer to live in a world with Reddit than a world without it.",

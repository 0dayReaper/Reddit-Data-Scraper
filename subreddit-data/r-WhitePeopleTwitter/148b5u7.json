The only way to really kill the GOP is turning their voters against them and there appears to be no other logical way.\n\nWe can say there fascists and point out things they are doing that line up with a fascists playbook, we can show the KKK and Nazi's supporting the GOP. This only seems to bring them more voters\n\nThe only other time they turn on their own is when one speaks out against them, but that's normally done right at retirement. Would love to see people like MTG have to defend herself to her maniac voters \"I am not a man, I am a woman!\". Meanwhile people are yelling for her to prove it.",

All of Barack Obama\u2019s policies, political appointees and laws that were passed would somehow become void? Trans people would no longer be a thing at all because they\u2019d be too embarrassed to live in a world with Michelle? \n\nSeriously what would happen? \n\nYou know conspiracy theories use to at least have a small kernel of believability in them because of what resulted afterwards. \n\nIt was easy for people to latch onto the idea of 9/11 being an inside job because of the Patriot Act being passed right after and the Iraq War. Or the moon landing being fake because of a need to prove American superiority during the Cold War. In no way we\u2019re these things true but at least you could see why people would believe it. \n\nNow? \n\nWho gives a shit what happened in the Obama\u2019s bedroom in the first place and if you remember correctly in 08 Obama wasn\u2019t open to gay marriage. Obviously that changed and he probably had to simplify lie in order to appeal to a more conservative democratic base, but if Michelle was trans it would have zero bearing on anything right now. \n\nAll these people do is prove their racism, transphobia and overall bigotry for literally nothing.",

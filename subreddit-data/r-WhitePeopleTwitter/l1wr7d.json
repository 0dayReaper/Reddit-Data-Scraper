They also nearly never complained about their income even well aware the factory made massive profits. People have gotten comfortable being shit on in some scenarios and are pretty much uncomfortable when given the means to try to change their income bracket. I think in one particular case, the company wasn't even outright against their employees unionizing, they just didn't actively encourage it and when somebody did try to get it going, the apathy and anxiety of the employees kept it from happening,  the company didn't even have to do anything or care to stop it.",

You have an healthcare costs spiraling out of control since the 1970s.  You have a pile of market-capturing legislation, including regulations, subsidies, licensing requirements, employer-based insurance, etc. constricting the healthcare market, leading to monopolization and heavily raising costs.  As a healthcare practitioner you have enormous costs like medical school debt and liability insurance that have to be passed onto the consumer.  The legal/regulatory environment is completely broken through a century of the government specifically intervening only in the interests of big businesses.  Ironically both a streamlined, properly managed \"universal healthcare\" system, *as well as a streamlined \"free market\" system* with some basic competency licensing, would both be an enormous improvement.  What we have right now works about as well as a head with a pipe through it.  We don't have any kind of good unified design, nor do we have freedom of choice or an unburdened market, so what we get is out of control costs, plummeting doctor/patient ratios, and worsening health outcomes.",

Example: Running MRIs, staffing them, and replenishing needed supplies is expensive. So few machines are ran all the time as a cost saving messure. An example of one that IS ran all the time is Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto. A literal cancer hospital, it's easy to see why we don't turn the lights off. \n\nOverall, it isn't bad. The most expensive thing for a hospital is probably parking. \n\nExample, I fractured my arm as a teenager. The ambulance was $25CAD, got tests done, then a plaster cast for free. My mom was very eager to get me a fiberglass cast so I can do dishes again. An appointment, few hours wait, 5$CAD, and a new cast later I was out with something new for friends to sign. \n\nSo no thank you America, I don't want your system. \n\nNow, it's not perfect. My mom's insurance covers thing like glasses, meds, and I give the info if I use a walk-in clinic. But nothing crazy (from my view.)\n\nHealthcare Triage actually has a a great [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkfBg8ML-gIngk82SUbTp6Og_KkYfJ6oF) on comparing different healthcare systems.

Honestly a German system of mandatory private insurence coverage offered by small competing companies would work best (in my opinion). Pretty much the federal government sets standards and companies are forced to be transparent on goals. Private companies can additional coverage for gaps like eyeware, copays, and brandname drugs. People are randomly assigned to a group (iirc).  co-pays are very low (like \u20ac10 a night in hospital) and only ~11% of Germans opt for additional coverage so it clearly isn't a 2 teir system. \n\nGerman isn't perfect, but assuming the same GDP% spending the USA would save a fortune while keeping private companies.

Unless you take certain college courses, you will never be taught what propaganda is or how it functions. We're awash in propaganda, drowning in it. And most people are oblivious.

This inevitably leads to enormous confidence in enormous falsehoods.

In order to get people to answer \"yes,\" you have to develop an ideology justifying the aristocracy, you have to propagandize the public, and occasionally you have to make minor concessions (social democracy).",

I\u2019m in australia and have private health insurance, for our family of 4 it\u2019s about 350 a month, which is partially subsidized by the govt. Last year it paid out quite a bit for dental and orthodontic, 400 towards my new glasses, subsidized Physio for my husband, mental health for my kid, several podiatry appointments for me. All of those things would have cost me a lot more without the insurance, as only certain people on low incomes qualify for free. \n\nIt\u2019s swings and roundabouts really. I had both my kids, for free, in the public system, great, but when I needed cataract surgery a couple of years ago I went private. They were fast growing cataracts and I needed them done ASAP. I still had to wait about 2 weeks to get a surgery date, but I would have waited months in public. My two surgeries cost me $500 in total (the hospital copay, in total, not 500 each), and all my specialist appointments were paid too (I think there was a bit of a copay but it wasn\u2019t much). But if I got knocked over by a bus tomorrow I would go to the public emergency room, but might later get transferred private after acute care. It\u2019s not perfect but it seems to work pretty well as a compromise. If you can afford private the govt helps and it\u2019s not ridiculously expensive anyway, and if you can\u2019t, or it\u2019s an emergency, there\u2019s public. The American system sounds horrific in comparison.",

You pay as much or less than Americans with good insurance, but you're charged *nothing* when you go to use it.\n\nEdit - typo.",

And with that long girly hair he has. I mean, it could be because he is trying to hide baldness, but maybe \u201che\u201d is just more comfortable with feminine hairstyles.   \n\n\n\u201cHe\u201c seems like he protests a bit too much. His \u201cwife\u201d really seems like a bit of a beard. I would not be surprised if \u201che\u201d is trans. Like Jenner, a man who wishes he was a woman, and married one that he wishes he looked like. Or maybe he was born a woman and is a lesbian trying to pass as a man. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Just asking questions.",

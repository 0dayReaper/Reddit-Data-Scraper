Hes even been noted, like with other things hes said in the past, calling cops pigs. \n\nThis man is 100% on Trumps side, repping the new ideology Trump has been spewing since his old flock failed.",

And the fence was chain link so you could easily see it from back yard to back yard. \n\nHe preceeded to buy many flags and burn one every weekend in his front yard so nothing could be misinterpreted.

It got found out those animals were killed preemptively to the show and were raised just for the show. This was deemed unethical, inhumane, and not protected by our first amendment even though the animals were treated fairly well up until that point. It was seen as it was, desecration. As well as a health hazard due to having rotting parts present which is what they used to shut the show down preemptively to the lawsuit. \n\nSo if this dude had a pig, literally killed it and beheaded it just for this moment, he could be found guilty of animal cruelty. If it was a taxidermied head hes had for 'novelty' that he bought hed be fine assuming it wasn't his pig and again, didn't kill the pig for the sole purpose of just being taxidermied for use later.\n\nLaws get weird when it comes to this kind of animal abuse. You can kill your own livestock to eat as cruel as possible, but not to set up effigies with their remains or any kind of religious ritual. MAGA is very much a cult which defines it as having religious conditions. Also like the other dude said, you can't just have rotting animal parts around in the public in unrecognized disposable areas. Its just a fine and being told to clean it up and failure to do so csn get you arrested but its still a misdemeanor.",

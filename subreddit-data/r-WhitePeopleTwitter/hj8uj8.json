Well that's what I've been told anyway, by my good friend, great friend, Chet McGallery. He's one of, no the best, the world's top expert on pranktel jokerals, and he's told me lots of stuff, huge stuff on the history of the pranktekal yokes. I  pronounce jokes, as uh, yokes because that's how it's supposed to be said, and I didnt know this, no one really knew, you needed to be expert in pragmatical Yolks like my great friend Mr. McCallister. I met him on one of my many, very... hugely important, presidential goodwill trips to Poland, beautiful country by the way, just stunning really I think everyone should go there soon, we set up some trump suits there, I think anyway, you should all go there. Anyway i was talking with my great friend, Chet McGee, and he says to me, he says, \"Donny, you gotta learn about these Yokes they have down here\" and that's when I learned that uh, practiced yokes came from Poland, see, Poland-practiced they're both \"P\" starting words that's how you know it came from Poland. And of course in Poland they dont pronounce the \"J\" properly like we do, they pronounce it like a \"Y\". And I dont know why they would do that, expecially since pole-land is an english speaking country. So I dont what's up with that. I dont know you tell me.",

Half the country is still as racist, sexist, and bigoted as he is, and are actively trying to dismantle as much as they can of what the country has been working toward for decades. \n\nIf he loses by a landslide, we can at least show that we're moving in the right direction.\n\nI agree him losing is a good outcome either way, but the raw numbers will show how much of a problem we still have to deal with outside of just him.",

Youth turnout since the 80's has hovered around 20%, while in 2018 it was ~32%.\n\nMaybe it didn't feel like the youth vote was so dominant in '18 because the voting rates were historic across the board.  Turnout for voters 60+ went from around 60% to 65%, for example.  But if that reflects a trend, then for every 1 \"energized\" senior voter, there are something like 3 or 5 \"energized\" youths.  Even if they lag in the overall vote totals, that still moves the needle.\n\nObama was an absolutely electric candidate for young people, and young voters topped out at something like 48% turnout.  In 2016, when the story is that they slept, they were still 43% (higher than Obama's reelection).  **Young people definitely need to vote more.**  True.  And this country would be a hell of a lot better off if they voted in the numbers seniors do.  But there does need to be realistic expectations of how much they alone can swing elections.\n\nThat said, we *might* see youth turnout top 50%, while seniors remain topped out at around 70%.  Rather than getting that 1 energized senior vote for every 3 young people, it's possible the we're near the natural ceiling for older voters.  Then, we could start to see a *huge* shift, because the youth vote has more room to grow than the other age groups probably can.  In my wildest dreams, I would never predict a 55% youth turnout, but I think it's a hell of a lot more achievable than the something like 80% senior turnout that would be necessary to counter it.\n\n(**Edit:** I talked a lot about the extreme age groups, but of course the people in the middle matter a hell of a lot, too.  It was a quick and dirty analysis of extremes, so take it with a grain of salt.)",

Look at the trend in the chart to see that voting registration goes down for every mid-term election. That\u2019s it\u2019s own problem and a topic for a different discussion.\n\n\nA better (but still flawed) representation of that table for predicting voter registration in presidential years would be this:\n\n\n**1996 - 128**\n\n2000 - 130 (+2)\n\n**2004 - 142 (+12)**\n\n2008 - 146 (+4)\n\n**2012 - 153 (+7)**\n\n2016 - 158 (+5)\n\n**2020 - ??? (+??)**\n\n\nRegistration in presidential election years, as shown here, has increased every election. Notice the bolded years, where the elections involved an incumbent president, show an even higher increase over the previous election than those without an incumbent. \n\n\nThis election will likely see a very large increase in voter registration based just on historical data and not factoring in any issues of the day.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Well, that\u2019s what the polls said in 2016, and Trump surprised the world. I wish they would start saying this is a tight race and every voter needs to turn out because they are needed to end this shit show. \n\nIn short, Biden needs to win Florida.

I had eaten a peanut butter sandwich earlier and if there is such a thing as a pleasant vomiting experience, it would've been this time. The stomach juices, I guess, were neutralized by the peanut butter so it didn't burn my throat on the way out and my mouth didn't have that sour distinctive post vomit taste.. tasted like peanut butter. \n\nWorst things I've thrown up:  hot dogs... the fucking taste and smell.. it was traumatic. Just thinking about it is making me queasy. \nSalad- the lettuce/spinach leaves would get stuck in the back of my throat where nasal fluid flows down into either your throat to swallow or into your mouth to spit out. Or they'd stick onto my uvula which would cause me to gag and then to barf again.\n\nFucking hotdogs were the worst.",

Sugar lobbies paid a bunch of scientists to sign off saying fat was causing obesity instead of refined sugars.  Now we have people over compensating in the other direction, avoiding all carbs.  It's a clusterfuck.\n\nIf you want to be healthy eat a balanced diet of single ingredient foods.  Like you can combine them all, but when you buy the stuff from the store it should be a single thing.  A tomato.  A piece of chicken.  etc.  Avoid anything processed or made in store.

Every book a child/student read and shared about it with their teacher they would get a sticker to put on the students pin they were given. I believe around 10 books read the pin would be filled and once handed in at Pizza Hut it was redeemable for a personal sized pizza. It was a total win as a kid. The program is still going, just have to sign up online not sure if its joinable in the restaurant anymore.",

My professor explained it by saying \"if kids are playing on your lawn, pay them for a few days to keep playing there and once you stop the payment they will stop coming\". My explanation is a bit wonky but it's late and I'm not a native english, so I hope it still makes sense!",

Kids respond to incentives just like adults do (you work to get paid, you work harder if you know a bonus is an option). But also for kids in school incentives lead to the positive feelings of doing well, so they often will actually change the behavior to earn the reward initially, but over time the self esteem boost they get from positive grades, plus positive reinforcement from others praising their work makes them still do well even when the incentive is eventually removed. \n\nSource: I am a mental health therapist who implements these systems with families on a regular basis",

Also, it\u2019s very normal for a good parent to worry that they are fucking up their kids. Your kid read 120 books in half of a year...sounds like you\u2019re doing a pretty good job to me! \n\nSecond of all, you literally implemented a behavioral therapy approach and it WORKED! That $120 would have cost you one therapy session just to learn how to do this....So I mean you\u2019re nailing it in my book :) if I were you I would feel proud\n\nEdit: whoops, I mixed up you and OP, but yeah still the same it\u2019s worth it. Even more so now bc you can take away the incentive (phone) if your kiddo doesn\u2019t keep up with his/her goals :)",

I had never won.....until that day.\n\nHis reaction was a mixture of proud dad, surprise and \"oh shit\". He never backs down, and bought me a '95 Pontiac Grand Prix that weekend. \n\nFunny thing? 6 years later when I was out of college, living on my own and needing a larger car, after buying myself a car, I gave it back to him since it wasn't worth much and he was looking for a good gas mileage car for work. That was over ten years ago. He still drives it to work, since it has better gas mileage than his truck.",

If he hadn't read a particular book I was interested in, he would still sit and listen, ask me questions, just see how into it I was.\n\nIt really broadened my tastes. From King to Hunter S.

I can usually tell how well she is paying attention by how many words at the ends she\u2019s written down. It\u2019s usually 1 or 2 words every few pages, so by the end of a 150 page book, I\u2019d expect to see about 50-75 words written down. So far, she\u2019s plowed through like 20 books this summer and it\u2019s a great investment. \n\nThe other easiest way to know she\u2019s reading is that with COVID, we\u2019re basically always home and can see her reading. Plus, an hour or so a night reading with her, and it becomes hard to fake. \n\nI imagine it\u2019d just be the honor system as she gets older and reads more independently.",

Research has repeatedly shown that using an extrinsic motivation (money, in this case), to get somebody to do something you want them to find intrinsically rewarding (enjoy reading), doesn\u2019t work. The intrinsic motivation actually ends up replaced by the extrinsic motivator. The result is decreased intrinsic motivation for the behavior you want them to enjoy. What usually happens after the extrinsic motivation stops is that the desired behavior also stops. In addition, rewards for reading for quantity will reduce reading for quality, as well as reduce reading comprehension.\n\nThis is not a good strategy. There is some clear research on what does work, however.\n\nIf you want your kids to read, read to them. Reading to your children is one of the very few interventions shown to significantly improve love of reading in children.\n\nEdit: citations\n\n- https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/blog/peaceful-parents-happy-kids/201707/whats-so-bad-about-bribing-your-child\n- https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-10497-001\n- https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1977-09554-001\n- Some various ways of bribing kids, which may our may not work, depending on the kid. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/the-right-way-to-bribe-your-kids-to-read.html\n\nUltimately, bribing kids to read, especially in the way this parent has done, are often counterproductive. You might get it right, but you run a high risk of reducing their love of reading by falling afoul of the overjustification effect.",

One summer, my parents told me and my brother if we read a certain amount of books over the summer (maybe like 15), we would get to go to a (our first) Vikings game. I ended up seeing Cris Carter's 1,000th reception, which happened to be a touchdown.\n\nDon't remember which books I read, but I read them, and I can still read to this day.\n\nEdit: Deleted an extra space and changed \"my\" to \"our\".",

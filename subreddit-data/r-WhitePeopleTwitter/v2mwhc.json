It\u2019s literally a rule in the Senate for Republicans: no voting for Democratic bills, ever.\n\nDemocrats passed the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act on 05/18, which was a week BEFORE Uvalde, after the Buffalo shooting. Now where is it? Dying in the Senate just like every other bill that would do anything to improve the lives of Americans.\n\nThis isn\u2019t on Democrats. They are paralyzed by the system. There is literally nothing they can do. They have only 50 votes and need every one of them, and 1-2 of them are Republicans in disguise so they\u2019re screwed.\n\nYou\u2019re buying into the rhetoric that conservatives are trying to push while actively hindering anything that would help anyone because they **want** things to get worse, they want people to suffer, so that when people go to the polls so independents will say \u201cthings suck, we should vote for the other party!\u201d and Democrats will say \u201cthey\u2019re not doing anything, why does it matter?\u201d\n\nIt DOES matter and we should all vote to kick Republicans out of enough offices so that Democrats can actually **pass the bills in the Senate that they\u2019re passing in the House**.\u201d",

They want their voters discontent.\n\nYou might say \"but they just showed their hand by voting againat it?\" but that's fine. Their voters only watch their media, and their media will not be mentioning that. They will continue to push the narrative that it's Brandon's fault.",

Supply and demand is fluid and based off of costs and sentiment towards a particular industry (oil in this case). \n\nHigh demand or low supply (like the current situation) is offset by higher prices, low demand and high supply is offset by lower costs. When the price is fixed by an outside factor (government price control), either supply or demand will get severely affected. Considering oil is a constantly high demand commodity, the only thing that can get affected is supply. \n\nHence the shortages of the 70s. Would you rather have high gas prices (due to a plethora of factors, not just the Republicans voting against this debatably performative bill) from high demand and low supply (the natural flow of a commodity), or would you rather wait in huge lines for cheaper gas, while potentially not even having the chance to buy such a necessary commodity?\n\nThis bill being passed wouldn't have been \"a temporary measure to keep working people's commutes down\". It doesn't even target the current situation. Hence why I think the Democrats used this as a completely performative measure (especially with an eye-catching, misleading name for the public to see), knowing the Republicans would vote against it.",

            "comment": "Oil and gas prices are up in literally every country on this planet but Americans think they\u2019re being price gouged.\n\nThe reason petrol prices are up is because there have been supply constraints coupled with record high demand for petrol. Americans are driving more than they ever have even despite millions of Americans still working from home. Americans traveled 272.4 billion miles in March 2019 vs. 277.4 billion for March 2022; demand for delivered goods has barely budged from pandemic highs. \n\nOil companies, on the other hand, have not expanded production. They\u2019re enjoying bumper profits after nearly a decade of depressed returns. They know the climate around them is changing and they know that governments around the world are trying to put them out of business over the next couple of decades, so they\u2019re sitting pretty and enjoy their record profits. They didn\u2019t receive assistance when prices collapsed in 2014 and stayed depressed for years, putting hordes of frackers out of business and depressing earnings. When prices reached epically low levels at the start of the pandemic causing another flurry of bankruptcies and closures, the Feds presented them with rather limited assistance, electing to help other industries to the chagrin of oil executives.\n\nNow prices are back to heightened levels after nearly a decade of depressed prices and oil companies are enjoying their profits, as are petrol producers. They\u2019re not going to expand capacity with an administration hostile to their interests in power. I don\u2019t blame them, why would they? Same goes to oil producers in non-OPEC countries around the globe. Other major oil exporters, particularly OPEC countries, are electing to keep production low to keep prices high because they too enjoy the bumper profits they\u2019re making after years of depressed returns.\n\nWhat oil companies are doing is not price gouging, it\u2019s supply and demand at work. \u201cCapital discipline\u201d, they call it. If you want to combat this alleged \u201cgouging\u201d, try driving less and using public transit where you can, fly less, etc.. there\u2019s absolutely nothing the Biden Admin or the legislature can do to change any of these facts besides helping companies go bankrupt, which will put the US into an oil crisis like the ones we saw in the 1970s. \n\nIf you put a cap on profits, they\u2019ll charge more to make up for this fact and as such, oil prices will rise further. If you respond by saying \u201cthe government should nationalize these hundreds of companies and operate them ourselves\u201d, good luck getting the men and women that work these jobs and man posts on board with that.",

Will try to give some explanation below. \n\nOil and it\u2019s refined products like gasoline are both commodities traded in the global market. They are impacted by regional supply and demand imbalances as well, but largely the macro decides the trend line (wether prices are going up or down). The oil companies are price takers, not price setters. They can\u2019t be price gauging because they don\u2019t set the price. That\u2019s a political quip used by opponents of oil and gas.\n\nThere\u2019s currently a drastic undersupply of crude oil worldwide, crude oil is refined by refiners into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc. Energy firms in the U.S. and globally have underinvested in new drilling projects for a couple years now for a number of reasons, leading to a shortfall in oil supply. \n1) To return more cash to shareholders rather than reinvest profits into the business.\n2) Covid wiped out demand and oil price, this type of sharp down cycle scares the decision makers and makes them tentative to sanction new projects. The brief period of negative oil prices is still fresh on the mind of executives.\n3) Rhetoric from the Biden administration has been highly erratic. Initially the tone was that their goal would be to completely end fossil fuel use. If this is the goal of the administration, the company can\u2019t prudently invest in long-term projects to supply more oil. Then the admin wanted them to produce more oil to relieve prices. Unfortunately it\u2019s not like a light switch you turn on or off. It takes months/years to bring a new oilfield online, not to mention hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\n\nEDIT: synthesizing my thoughts more quickly below.\n\nTLDR - oil companies are not price gauging, prices are high because demand is high and supply is low. Supply is low because of the reasons listed above.",

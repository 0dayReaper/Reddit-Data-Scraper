Above lets say 75-80F  it should be refrigerated or at least kept in a cooler room. Many max the temp out at 75. However this also depends on what type of butter it is, for example unsalted butter is not as likely to be safe to leave out.",

It's usually ok at room temp, but once you're in the 80s or higher, it can actually start to bubble in just a few days.

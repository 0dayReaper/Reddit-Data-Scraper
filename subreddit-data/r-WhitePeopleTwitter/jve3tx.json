                            "comment": "The safety and efficacy data parts of the development process were not skipped and the timeline was not compressed. What was compressed was the manufacturing part, which was done in parallel to studies and is typically not invested in until safety and efficacy are established. The financial risk of developing a vaccine was removed from the equation, which is why it happened so fast. The safety and efficacy are relatively clear, there is no reason not to get the vaccine as soon as it is approved. Source: PhD who studies this shit professionally.\n\nEDIT: I'll try to answer some frequent questions here. \n\nFor those concerned about the fast timeline: SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses and our experience with them earlier this century gave us a pretty good understanding of how to make an effective vaccine before SARS-COV2 even appeared, so we hit the ground running right away. Critically, Operation Warp Speed provided billions in funding so that vaccine manufacturers could run clinical trials and scale up manufacturing in parallel, which is typically a sequential process. Take a look at slide 17 in this PPT, it explains it really well: \n\nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/risk-comms-updates/update37-vaccine-development.pdf?sfvrsn=2581e994_6\n\nFor those concerned about long-term side effects: I don't have a definitive answer for you here, unfortunately. Vaccine clinical trials do typically monitor adverse events for a longer period of time than we've seen in the development of these vaccines, typically around 1 year prior to FDA approval. Adverse events typically occur soon after immunization, so I'm not THAT concerned that we're going to miss major safety signals if the approval comes before that 1-year follow up period. I think they would likely be caught in these trials. Also, vaccines are licensed based on the results of phase 3 clinical trials, which typically look at safety and efficacy data (which we have for these vaccines), and then there is an agreement between the vaccine manufacturer and the FDA to do post-licensure follow-up studies where they monitor vaccine recipients for years after they are vaccinated to detect long-term effects. This will obviously be the case here. \n\nFrom a purely scientific perspective, I have no reason to believe that this vaccine will lead to long-term side effects. It's true that it's a novel platform, but lipid nanoparticle delivery systems are already used in other FDA-approved drugs. The other component of the vaccine is the mRNA, which simply instructs the cells to produce the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus. It's a new vaccine technology, but I don't see any reason that it would be unsafe. \n\nIt's important to remember that this is a special situation and, while not ideal, the scientific and medical evidence is very promising at this point.",

So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece and who walks in but Dr. Saad.\nI was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Dr. Saad, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Dr. Saad put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.",

Im not saying prior administrations were more trustworthy, there is a pretty good history of deceiving the public, but it really shows how distrust has grown in a short time. And i dont find it more comforting that the CEOs pf these pharma companies are giving their reassurances that they will not push out a vaccine that has not been proven safe given their track records with the public interests recently. \n\nIm not trying to spread more doubt, just verbalizing what i bet a lot of people feel. Its really unfortunate that the elite have eroded public trust so much, when its so hard to earn it to begin with. It makes being an average person feel helpless.",

The trials are happening similar to other trials. The difference is that governments around the world agreed to pre-buy vaccines, giving these companies a bunch of cash to start the manufacturing process much earlier.   Normally you'd wait before investing that kind of money, but production was essentially financed from public dollars from around the world.\n\nMaybe after this, we can start discussing how in the future, publicly funded may be the better route for all research into medications.",

You could have 100 non-political conversations with him and be completely blown away to find out he\u2019s a Trump supporter. It\u2019s sad. I\u2019ll never look at him the same.

His very first action was an attempt to ignore laws and unilaterally create rules like a king. Is that not an example of him stubbing his toe on his first step as President - and worth of the media increasing the amount of scrutiny around his future actions?\"*\n\nThe response was predictable but infuriating... \"Obama had a ton of Executive Orders and the media never cared (they did). Besides, he's allowed to make new laws through Executive Order (debatable). He had every right to fire the AG if they refused to do what they were told (Not how the Justice Department works). It was all a stage show by the DEEP STATE to make him look bad, if any other President had made the same order no one would have cared (not true).\"",

I'm not saying you shouldn't take the vaccine, and I'm not claiming that there are going to be issues.\n\nIt's just that, for my own peace of mind, I will likely not be among the first to take it. In any case, I'm not in any of the groups who are supposed to be 'first in line'.

They have gates and checks/balances to ensure safety...in fact safety is the first to come out and right now they are checking only efficacy.  Comments like this, that get upvoted, feed into people on the fence when the truth is your odds of dying or getting major complications from Covid itself are FAR higher than the risk of this vaccine.  Stop this type of passive aggressive attitude.  Saying nothing at all is better than potentially influencing others from doing what is the better and safer option.",

None of this is entirely new, so discounting the \"discovery\" of any part of this story is probably an accurate description of the situation. \n\nThat being said, the kind of basic research which was being done on coronaviruses in bats in china last year, and the basic research on how to build a mRNA vaccine, all contributed to a fast development of candidate vaccines. \n\nThat basic research is good not only for Sars-Cov-2 and COVID-19, but other things as well. That is why I don't like it when budgets try to cut funding to things like the NIH or National Labs. They provide the basic understanding to draw on when we need to create new treatments and solve problems.",

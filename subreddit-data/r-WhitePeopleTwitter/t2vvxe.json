While there were some Germans and Italians that were put in camps in the US during WW2, it was to a much smaller extent proportionally than the Japanese living in the US at the time and it was on a case by case basis that were individually reviewed.  Also, interestingly enough, the Japanese Americans and Italian Americans received an official apology from the US after their internment, but the German Americans never did.",

He decided to stay in Colorado where his internment camp was. He bought land in Colorado and became a prosperous farmer again.\n\nHe said when the internment was announced, his neighbors came over and offered him $0.10 for all of his property in the house. These were people he had considered friends. He set fire to it before the government came to take him away.\n\nIt's really shameful how callously the subject is treated today.",

As part of their treaties with the Canadian government, many indigenous communities bargained for a transition to an agriculture-based economy; after all, their food sources had all been destroyed and their communities were being kettled into smaller and smaller plots of land.\n\nAfter many delays and half-measures, the Canadian government provided these communities with the mechanised farming equipment necessary for prairie agriculture. And many communities did well, being able to produce enough wheat and other cash crops to sustain themselves and even sell as surplus.\n\nThis set off a furor among colonial Canadians, because now \"indians\" were competing economically with whites. The Canadian government confiscated the equipment and banned indigenous communities from using modern farming tools, growing cash crops or selling goods off-reserve. Farming became pointless, and indigenous economy was made a crime.\n\nOf course, we also incarcerated Japanese Canadians and stole *their* property, but I don't remember if farming and agribusiness was involved.\n\nLittle bit of unsolicited Canadian history for you.",

I don't just mean the overt racism and xenophobia that people associate with anti-immigrant rhetoric, but by the invisibility that normal every day people unwittingly impose on new citizens.\n\nTalk to people and get to know them. It is not hard and I find that often new immigrants are pleased to talk to you if you show an interest in them because sadly... it can be uncommon. I'm sure when they immigrated to your country they pictured themselves making friends with the native population, not living in insular communities and feeling alienated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: also Sikhs rule.",

I saw a post on here earlier about two Russian soldiers who's tank ran out of fuel who went to the local police station looking for some more (and were naturally taken into custody). I wonder if they did that on purpose, knowing that they would be arrested and thus out of the war. Either that, or they hadn't had any encounters with the locals yet and believed the propaganda that they were there to free the people from Nazis.",

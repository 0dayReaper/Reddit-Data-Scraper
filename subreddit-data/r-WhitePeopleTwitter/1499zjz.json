Not only does this social pecking order self-justify said exploitation (eg. \"The poor are lazy and deserve to be poor\") it effectively protects the billionaire by forcing society to literally value him above and beyond other people.\n\nThis is why crimes against the poor by the rich get ignored or only result in token justice, but shoplifting from walmart can put you in prison for a decade (assuming the cop doesn't just decide to execute you instead).\n\nTrolling and satarizing the wealthy creates cracks in this artificial social construct by showing billionaires as the petty and pathetic individuals they are (hi Elon!).",

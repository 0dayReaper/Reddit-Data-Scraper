He's so unbelievably wealthy, yet he wants workers to take a massive risk just to make more. All of these billionaires should have been looking after their staff out of their own pocket until it was safe for then to come back to work, but also pushing the government to make sure that the benchmark for safety is the right one. Instead they hid away from the virus and demanded that their people go die for them. Assholes, all. Elon is particularly egregious.",

Like at the end of June he was saying how covid-19 was overblown because cases were going up but deaths were going down (common covid conspiracy theorist logic at the time). Anyone with a little bit of critical thinking would know that you don\u2019t die immediately after you get covid. It takes like three weeks to die. So all those new cases in June don\u2019t end up dead until July. And now that it\u2019s July, we\u2019re seeing a rise in deaths again due to the rise in cases from June.",

Musk has been open about his disdain for human life, and given a choice between going to Mars safely in a hundred years with a good plan or going to Mars tomorrow and treating people there like disposable slaves, he's openly said he'll pick the latter. And if the way he's treated his factory workers during a global pandemic is any indication, you can guess how he'd treat people on Mars during a water shortage that only exists because he's a big boy who makes big boy submarines and he wanted to do the thing NOW.",

As an American working/living with South African of the privledged class, there's a certain entitlement and hubris particular to those that grew up during Apartheid, and even after- the mentality didn't disappear overnight.  I grew up down the street from one SA guy whose family moved in when we were like 15 years old  to an NYC suburb- the guy just had this extreme, loud and tone-deaf exceptionalism thing going on. It lasts to this day, 20 years later, here in the US where he's spent the majority of his life. He reminds me of a less-intelligent, just as tone-deaf and annoying version of Elon Musk in many ways. If he could speak, he would say \"What I do is exceptional, I am exceptional, and everyone should recognize me for that!\"\n\nThe Canadians I work with (we're in the mining industry) actually were first to point this out- I always thought my SA neighbor was just a peculiar dickhead. But lots of educated South African men have this trait, after working with them. Women have mentioned it to me, too- the guys just think they're special and it particularly doesn't gybe well with Canadian culture.",

A STEMlord is a pejorative term for a particular kind of person who has studied in these areas at university or works in these fields who holds a pretentious, condescending attitude to anyone who has studied in any other fields, particularly the Arts and Humanities. They typically believe themselves to be more \"intelligent\" and \"rational\", while generally remaining incredibly ignorant outside of their areas of expertise...\n\nhttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=STEMlord\n\nIt seems most common with those working for tech companies as software / data / electrical / mechanical engineers. Yeah, obviously not every single person who majors in a STEM field is a \"stem lord\", the term was coined to refer to a specific type as described above. Spend enough time here in the right threads and you'll see some making comments fitting the description above, though it used to be worse a few years ago.",

Bernies point seems to be that people need that sort of immediacy too.\n\nThe democrats in Congress are trying to get a bill passed ASAP to provide immediate assistance to people. Mitch McConnell laughed when asked if that would get passed soon.\n\nThat\u2019s the conversation. That the comfortable billionaire supports UBI is nice, but almost entirely irrelevant.\n\nI am fortunate enough to have a very comfortable financial situation. Obviously I\u2019m no billionaire but I\u2019m fine. I can talk all goddamn day about UBI, but here\u2019s the deal: that doesn\u2019t pay bills in my community, which is struggling right now. And if republicans can\u2019t bring themselves to provide minimal assistance today, I think UBI isn\u2019t going to happen in the next few weeks when people need money\n\nThat\u2019s the problem. Elon injects himself into EVERY conversation for publicity sake. He has hot takes, shit takes, he drives attention mostly to himself. And he has an army of fans who need to explain all his idiocy as \u201coh this is what he actually meant\u201d and \u201csee 14 months ago, he specifically said this\u201d\n\nElon is a remarkable entrepreneur. We don\u2019t need to rely on his Perspectives on every single topic though.\n\nUBI is nice, he should take that as a goal. He should also support people getting money soon, because rent will be due and people need to eat, and Americans are still struggling with unemployment.",

This is a good start, but the fact that we don't have complete transparency from our paid representatives is insane. I would never hire a high paid, powerful job in my company and not have complete transparancy on what they do with company funds, when they are lying to consumers or clients who fund the business... I'm sure their corporate donors get all that info but not us peasants.",

But he also sits in a tractor monitoring stuff so by way of actual labor to income he\u2019s doing just fine. \n\nWell he had no need for the loan. None at all.

And here\u2019s my two cents:\n\n1) I make more than the cut-off so I don\u2019t qualify for the loan forgiveness anyway.\n2) Even if I did, it\u2019s $10k \u2014 I\u2019m over $300k in debt on my student loans. That $10k ain\u2019t touching shit for me.\n3) I can comfortably pay off my loans (eventually) and not starve to death. I wholeheartedly support loan forgiveness for others who are not so fortunate. If I have to pay taxes, I want it to help someone, by god.\n4) I know where Mullin lives. I know his (at least visible) business. He did not need that PPP loan.\n\nI wish these people would shut up and stop being so disingenuous. Anyway, my four cents.\n\nEdit: I should also add that my husband paid off the last of his student loan two years ago, after working nearly twenty years to pay it off. He also supports student loan forgiveness. These talking points are all bullshit.",

Money is too important to go to corrupt individuals. Better give them to angelic businesses and have the money trickle down. \n\nI fucking hate this timeline.",

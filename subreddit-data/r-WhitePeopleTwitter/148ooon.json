They already see him as being persecuted, not prosecuted, and he could slap those photos on every single piece of merchandise imaginable. Further don't compare Nazi-lite Jack Teixeria and actual whistleblower Reality Winner. One did it to impress teenagers online and one was actually concerned about our country.",

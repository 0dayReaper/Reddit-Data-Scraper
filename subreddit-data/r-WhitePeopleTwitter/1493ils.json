They might be ignorant, but a poll asking \"do you approve of trans people?\" and \"the government should decide who gets trans affirming care\" received wildly different results. (in a good way) If you ask people if they're tired of trans people being the target of the conversation, something like 80% of people say they're over politicians playing games.\n\nI kind of wonder what will happen from this. The 24 hour news cycle is exhausting, and Trump has used it to stay a part of the conversation. What happens when people are just tired of being mad about dumb shit?

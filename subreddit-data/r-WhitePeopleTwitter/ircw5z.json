It is *GREAT* to be able to buy all these game of the year games for like \u00a315, something like batman arkham asylum for example, or the borderlands games, dark souls etc. All games I never heard of till I got back into it.\n   \nYou can find a lot of good deals like that at /r/patientgamers\n  \nBut yeah you wanna play PS2 Dynasty Warriors? Emulate it. My gaming pc is pretty crap, really, but it emulates PS2 games perfectly, and Gamecube games too. So I've been playing all the old classics, like the best FPS game ever Timesplitters 2, the ps2 Tony hawks games, Metroid Prime for Gamecube etc. So try it out. Its super easy to emulate games. Can you open a Word file in Word? Then you know how to emulate games. It's simply opening a game file in an emulator. Dolphin is for Gamecube (and Wii), and you can do stuff like play Metroid Prime with a mouse and keyboard if you prefer that to controllers, and for PS2 there's PCSX2. If you run into any problems, just Google it, the answers are there. Like you have to set up a bios for the consoles thing because they're disc based systems, but that just involves googling \"PS2 bios\" and then you'll find download links. And for the games, just Google \"ps2 dynasty warriors rom\" and there you go, multiple sites to download from. Have ublock origin installed and on, and have an anti virus, just in case, but it's pretty safe it you've used the Internet before.",

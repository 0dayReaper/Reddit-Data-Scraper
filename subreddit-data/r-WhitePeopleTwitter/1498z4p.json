Maybe we shouldn't be creating divisions within an already problematic enforcement system with a mission and assumptions that everyone they come in contact with will be the worst of the worst. Arm a bunch of cowards with guns and immunity and tell them they are the only ones standing between civility and chaos and of course they are gonna shoot first and ask questions later. \n\nIn this particular case the kids involved definitely made mistakes, not excusing their dumb ass behavior but they were kids and the punishment for mistakes shouldn't be death. There has to be a better way to ensure public safety and teach kids lessons other than shooting them dead.",

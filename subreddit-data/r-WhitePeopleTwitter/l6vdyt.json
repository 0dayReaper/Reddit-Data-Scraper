            "comment": "It's not a coordinated attack, that's the narrative that Wall Street is pushing. Hedge funds made some very risky investments by trying to get a company to go bankrupt, thinking they were untouchable and nothing was going to happen. People happened to believe the company they were betting on still had the potential to recover and bought their stock. Wall Street's risky position blew up in their face because of it. That's the only story here\n\nEdit: to be clear, people started buying gamestop stock as far back as 2019 believing it had potential to turn around its business and were publicly posting about their belief in the company. Are you going to tell me they \"coordinated an attack\" for the past year and a half? The only coordinating here was by the hedge funds trying to short sell gamestop into bankruptcy. Why do they get to decide if a business gets to exist if consumers still believe in them? They've only continued to double down on their shorts even as the stock price increased, their own greed put them into this position and WSB has done nothing but say WE LIKE THIS STOCK\n\nEdit 2: People are still saying GameStop had no chance of turning around their business, let me point you towards things that indicated otherwise. 1) new consoles were coming out. Historically, GameStop has always had increased business around new console releases and these consoles still had disc drives indicating their manufacturers still thought consumers would like to buy physical discs. GameStop is a major seller of physical game discs. 2) Ryan Cohen, co-founder and former CEO of Chewy.com, bought a 13% stake in the company with a plan to adopt a strategy that would transform the company into a specialized e-commerce seller of gaming products, 3) GameStop signed a multi-year deal with MicroSoft to share revenue for all digital sales on any xboxes they sold. All of these things happened *last year*, long before any talk of a \"short squeeze\", because people saw potential in GameStop. The squeeze came about because hedge funds kept shorting the stock even though GameStop was making these changes. This is the hedge funds fault they're in this",

Him getting on board with GameStop is reason enough to instill confidence in the company and cause a surge in the price of stock.",

If gamestop could transition into a digital marketplace I see no reason why it's guaranteed to fail. If they could make a digital platform like steam where you can purchase console games and coordinate your library through multiple systems it would even out a lot of the things that make PC better than consoles. I don't see any brand other than gamestop with the worldwide recognition and clout to be able to pull that off.",

Lets say you are a company getting started and you want to grow. You want to expand and have new locations and get new product and salespeople and a good CEO, you just really want to get big and make millions. So, what do you need to grow if you are a young American company looking to get big. You need these three things:\n\n#1) Capital\n\n#2) Capital\n\n#3) Capital\n\nThere are other things you need like a good vision and a good CEO and good motivation and all that shit but the hardest thing is start up capital. Thats why the kids of rich people often start companies. They have the start-up capital of their parents. But lets say you were not lucky enough to be born rich. How do you get capital. There are only two ways- loans or equity. Thats it, thats all finance is. The last time I taught Finance I said this, I said there are only two parts of finance- loans and equity. Then I threw the book across the room. Thats literally all finance is. \n\nOkay the first one, loans. That is a decent way to get capital. So you can walk down the street and tell Bank of America hey I am starting ChadOfDoom Popcorn company, its going to be amazing, I need $50,000. They might give it to you but they are going to have a lengthy approval process, ask for all kinds of collateral and also charge you 9% interest. Pretty steep. \n\nThere is one other option, called equity. You can sell of pieces of yourself. If you become big like Game Stop did an investment firm like GameStop did in the early 2000s you can sell off big chunks of yourself and use the money for capital- buying locations and servers and product and hiring good workers, etc. They actually got started with money from Barnes and Noble but then paid them back when they did the initial public offering (ipo). So then there were 18million shares of their company out there. AFter a company gets the start up money all the things you hear about stocks are on the secondary market. So people buying GME all day and night isn't directly helping Gamestop its people making money from the buys and sells. Thats all a stock is, a piece of the company. Hit me back with questions but it is important to learn.",

People on their Robinhood accounts or eTrade or whatever, they want to be a part of the fun. The short sellers I don't believe are buying the shares back right now. They need to but they have the money to sit and wait. But they have to pay interest to borrow the shares so not only are they getting fucked by the shares going up in price, they are getting fucked by margin interest. You said you were a noob so let me explain. Lets say you want to short a stock, you don't like the company, you think they will go down not up, so you call TD Ameritrade and say you want to short the company. TD Ameritrade has a bunch of shares of GME so they say sure, we will loan you shares to short at 9% interest you can short the stock. So you sell the stock right away to someone else thinking it will go down but you are borrowing it because you never owned it, you sold it short. What happens when it goes from $200 to $400 like it did this morning? You are losing your shirt. TD Ameritrade is telling you to put more money in your account or they will sell off all your other shares (lets say you had Apple and MSFT and a bunch of other shit). They will liquidate it and put it into your margin. Eventually you will have to buy that share back that you shorted. And not only will you have to buy it back for the higher price, you will have to pay the interest. Does that make sense?",

Thats the part everyone knows.\n\nShorting, is when someone borrows stocks from someone, and sell it to someone else at the market price, with the obligation of buying them back at one point so the lender gets their stock back. While borrowing the stocks, they pay interest to the lender. The goal of shorting is to borrow stocks, sell them at 100$, wait for the stock price to go down, buy them back at 50$, and give them back to the original lender. That way, the people shorting made 50$ profit, minus interest.\n\nMany big hedge funds apparently do that, while manipulating the market to make sure the stock goes down.\n\n~~Naked short is when the amount of borrowed stock is bigger than the total amount of stocks.~~ For example, Gamestop has 1000 stocks, yet there are 1400 stocks being shorted. My understanding is that people can short stocks that are already being shorted. So a stock can be borrowed and shorted in chain, leading to 140% shorting.\n\nThe problem here, is that these companies are obligated to buy the options back at one point, no matter the price. There are no time limits per say, but if the total price of stocks you have to buy back equals your available money, you are obligated to buy at whatever the price is and declare bankruptcy. But since 140% of stocks are being shorted, if the price goes up, and people want to bail out of the stocks before it goes up too much, you have more people trying to buy than available stocks.\n\nWallstreetbets people notice that, and decided to make use of that situation. They started buying and buying whatever they could, and never selling. Because of that, the very few people selling increase the price of the stock. As the price goes up, the shorter panic, and tries to buy even more, and the price skyrocket to the moon. As long as WSB doesn't sell, the price will keep going up, and the shorters loses billions.\n\nEventually, when all the shorters will be dead, the price of GME will crash back down to its natural value. In the meantime, the big companies that kept manipulating the market for years, are getting it done to them by normal people, and are angry. They are trying to illegally manipulate everything they can to stop it.\n\nEDIT: read below for an accurate definition of naked shorting",

However this is _not_ the definition of naked shorting.\n\nNaked shorting is when you go to the market and say \"I want to sell 100 shares!\", but you haven't purchased or borrowed 100 shares. Someone else completes your order and lists on their book that they have 100 shares. Thus, 100 shares just poofed into existence.\n\nIn short, naked shorting is selling shares that _don't exist_, with the intention that by the time you're required to send over the shares (possibly a day or more after the trade), you'll have purchased or borrowed the shares.\n\nAs far as I know, there isn't any naked shorting going on for GME stock as it's highly illegal. However, the rest of what you said is correct",

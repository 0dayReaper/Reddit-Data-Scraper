The employee has the choice to accept or not.\n\nHaving _employment_ be contingent on a non-compete is not okay. Imagine you're a highly specialized worker, and there's two corporations in your city who might need that skillset. In a world with broad non-competes: Amazing, you have to pack up and move your family _or_ take a job outside your field (and likely pay grade). As the above commenter said: You're going to be willing to put up with a lot more abuse from your employer if the alternative is ripping your spouse and kids away from their lives.\n\nThere's a name for this: Labour market monopsony. Monopsony power gives employers the power to keep wages lower than they otherwise would need to in a competitive labour market. This is a monopoly, but from the other direction, and it's no better than a monopoly, which we recognize as a bad thing.\n\nNotice how these things are vastly in the employers' favour?\n\nContrast this with how this works in Canada: The vast majority of non-competes are blanket ones, and as a result are non-enforceable.  (It's to the point where a Tim Horton's franchisee tries to have a non-compete saying that you can't get another fast-food job within X kilometers, ridiculous). I have a non-compete that I've accepted. It says that I cannot work in my field, for a company in the same industry sector, within a constrained geographic boundary. I don't mind this, I have options, and with the clause came a reasonable severance provision. I can change my field (lame), work in my field in another sector (yay), or outside the geography (lame). I work in IT, so my field is broad, and every company needs IT, so mine's not the best example of specialized work, but just as an example of non-competes that are not 1000% in the employer's favour.",

Non-competes and NDAs run on a very thin line between illegal and legal.\n\nFor enforcement, the question isn't 'well you signed so it's law', the question is 'is the clause of this contract actually legal' and if it is not it cannot be enforced.\n\nIf he's still being paid \\[IDK if he is or is not\\] and can use the time until his 'contract' expires on his resume as 'employed' by Fox, then there isn't an issue from me. In my opinion, that's the *only* way a non-compete clause should be enforced, if you are adequately paid to not be competition.\n\nYou *cannot* sign away certain rights in exchange for employment, even if you are a rich scumbag who doesn't need the job. As a reminder, this argument coming from me is from my disdain of NCs and *not* due to me wanting Tucker to have any mouthpiece what-so-ever.",

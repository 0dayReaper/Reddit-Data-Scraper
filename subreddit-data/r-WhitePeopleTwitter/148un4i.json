The demographic that does watch it, tends to skew old and white. That is why they are \"the most watched cable news channel\". It sounds impressive until you look at TV Viewership numbers compared to even 10 years ago. \n\nThey are hemmorhaging viewers and have been since they decided to not lean into the lie that cost them almost $1 Billion and counting. When they fired Fucker Carlson, they lost even more viewers. Trump ranting against them isn't helping. What you are seeing here is them trying desperately to hold onto a hostile audience that isn't watching them as much as they used to.",

She was forced into a religion and even today she still has that slight racist/homophobic remarks. My girlfriend's sister was raised by a foster family that were raised in the same environment. She's a native who married a racist caucasian, treats her full native child like garbage and her biracial child gets spoiled. These ideals still exist today from people who were brainwashed, and being around her children, I genuinely feel like her son will be featured in a Making a Murderer documentary. On July 1st when my girlfriend was talking to her, she said that she didn't understand why so many people opposed Canada Day, and when we explained about the graves they found, her racist boyfriend decided to crack a joke about how they were probably r*ped and thought it was funny as hell while the sister just nodded.\n\nEven if the schools aren't active today, their influence still is, and the government and a large majority of the population won't even acknowledge it. A few years back the entire country had a moment of silence when a highschool football team died in an accident, but everybody is oddly silent over the 750+ unmarked graves found. And it's only the beginning of the ones we'll find I am sure.",

I grew up in the ghetto areas of Los Angeles and went to school right in the middle of many different types of neighborhoods. \n\nMy high school was primary black and Hispanic. With Latinx from different parts of Mexico with different languages and south American countries too. \n\nThe third largest group was Asians from all countries and pacific islanders, but the largest of this group was Koreans. Most my friends in middle/high school were Korean, we were all into Japanese culture and most of us lived in and around Korea town and we're neighbors with Indians, Saudis, Iranians, Pakistanis and many other countries of people. \n\nAll of that to say it's fairly easy for me to tell the difference based on what language their speaking and be able to tell Koreans from Japanese, Filipino, Chinese or Laotian. All I'd takes is exposure.  \n\nBut I'll tell you having grown up around so few white people. They all look very similar to me, I have gotten in trouble for confusing people I was working with (in uniform) for strangers out of uniform. I'm good with voices cause I'm an audio tech but in the face you white you Ben Affleck.",

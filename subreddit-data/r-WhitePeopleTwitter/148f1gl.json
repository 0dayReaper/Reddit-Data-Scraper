We\u2019re seeing some of the lingering effects of such drastic financial action.\n\nSo, yeah, we would have seen that inflation spike regardless of who is in the White House.  We would have seen strong growth once the ripple effects started settling down regardless of who is in the White House.\n\nThat said, it really helps that we have someone in the White House who is being responsible and not seeking out ways to create new global economic catastrophes.",

Lies and disinformation need constant grooming to hold their power over people. Overtime the Fox News has to move on to other topics and the truth lives on slowly checking people one by one.",

American producers were starting to seriously feel the hurt, as they had been ramping up production and now had a ton of product with no one to sell to. Barrels were piling up and storage space was running out.\n\nTrump plead with OPEC+ to reduce production in an attempt to bail out American producers. OPEC+ made a deal with him and they reduced production by 10 millions barrels a day.  This basically rescued American producers from needing another government bailout, but ended up doing a number on average consumers as oil demand returned to normal while foreign production remained decreased.  This is a contributing factor in the very high gas prices we saw during the first year of the Biden administration.",

This was to spite Russia for refusing to abide by an agreement made within OPEC. The result was that all of the oil barons in the US would have to reduce their sales prices to stay solvent. So, the president of the United States made a phone call to the Saudis to plead with them to raise the price so that our oil overlords would meet their quarterly earnings. Not that he doesn't do things completely malignantly, but in this particular case it was less \"harm to others\" and more \"help to friends\".\n\n\nTLDR: He's telling the truth, and it was just to make sure his buddies got paid.",

I had gotten a case of Coors Light (because that's my go-to for light domestic beer) and the guy behind me in line made some comment like \"Bud Light boycott still going strong\" (tone implying approval of my choice)... My response was a measured \"They all run Pride campaigns, so if that's why you're boycotting something, you might as well just stop drinking altogether\"... His only comeback was a mumbled \"Well, you could brew your own\".\n\nI almost regret not making the dude wait while I ran back and grabbed a case of Bud Light... but that would have been giving him too much power. While I do sometimes enjoy Bud Light, I just tend to prefer Coors Light and I'm not letting some idiotic political fight (that's almost entirely one-sided at this point) dictate my choices.",

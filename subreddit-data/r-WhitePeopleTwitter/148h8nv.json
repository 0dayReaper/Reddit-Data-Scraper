Other Russians might be understood as at least partial victims of propaganda but these are guys who get exposed to competing ideas on the regular and still choose to believe the oligarchy's version of events.  Are they paying you boys enough to walk willingly into the Ukrainian meat grinder?  Even if Russia wins the war nothing will have been fixed for the Russian people.  Any gains made will filter to the money/power folks up top.  You'll still be getting paid poverty wages to tell lies.",

Those trying to discourage voters have been very successful among the poor, the undereducated, and the disabled. They have convinced them that it's not worth the effort and that if they make some innocent mistake, they will be jailed. \n\nThey truly believe that voting jeopardizes their freedom and safety. I am in a rural and red area and YMMV but that has been my personal observation over the past ten years. It went from things I never heard to the most common thing I hear as a reason for not voting. You can argue who is responsible for this amongst yourselves but I will point out that our Justice System hasn't helped things.",

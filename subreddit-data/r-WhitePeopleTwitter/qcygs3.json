He then said \u201cok I\u2019ll call you right now so you have mine too!\u201d And I just smiled and said \u201coh no, it\u2019s not worth it! My phone is completely dead and I don\u2019t have a charger!\u201d I then pulled my phone out and \u201ctried\u201d hitting the button to turn the screen on. Obviously I didn\u2019t apply pressure on the button, and completely sold him in the idea that my phone was dead. I then quickly asked him for the time and made an exaggerated gasp when he told me. I said I was supposed to meet a friend 30min earlier and sprinted out the door. \n\nIt honesty was such a proud moment for me and changed the way I dealt with guys. I felt like I actually had the confidence to turn them down after that. I don\u2019t mind taking a more direct approach now either\u2026",

We hit it off but I had crap for self confidence at the time so when we got on the bus I took a seat and put in my headphones. She comes to sit next to me and asks why I didn't sit with her. I tell her I didn't want to bother her even though I'd love to keep talking to her. \n\nWe talk for a while the bus drives us back to campus and when we get off she stops me and asks for my phone so she can give me her number. I do and thank her and say I'd love to talk to her later and say I'll shoot her a text once I get back to my dorm room since my hands were full of groceries. We part ways, I get back to my dorm room, shoot her a text saying that it was the guy from the campus shuttle she just talked to and just wanted to make sure you have my number so we can talk or hang out sometime.\n\nFound out then that she gave me the wrong number.... The one who approached me twice and offered it...\n\n(This is why I have trust issues.)&lt;- ETA this is a joke. This whole event also happened nearly a decade ago. To answer some common questions\nWhy did I think she gave me a fake number?\nI was in the worst depression of my life and my self confidence and self esteem was shot. I had just come out of a long term relationship that ended with cheating and had an abusive stepfather who spent a lot of his time treating me like shit and telling me how worthless and awful I am.\n\nWhy didn't I talk to her about it later?\nIt was a huge campus with 20000 students and we were different majors. I never saw her again.\n\nWhy did one little event shatter my trust? \nIt didn't. That part was a joke.\n\nHonestly things are working well for me now at least. I had a really bad few years after that but that is a long story having to do with that aforementioned stepfather. I'm doing well now and have a wonderful partner and a good job.",

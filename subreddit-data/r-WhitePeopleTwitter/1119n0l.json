That whole incident on Everest was so fascinating because so many people were on the mountain due to the beginning of the consult trips, but also the ability to communicate via satellite was new. Getting live updates base camp as fast as the world seeing was new. And there were two journalists. Then Krakauer's article and Annatoli's response are both incredible... Toli survived that year on Everest. Saved so many people, then died the next year in an avalanche. \n\nI sometimes wonder what he and Krakauer would talk about as older men. Especially their opinions about the current state of Everest and above 8000m climbing in general.",

You could anonymously contact a good journalist about that, someone that reports on these type of issues, because that's a serious story right there. \n\nThe people in charge deserve to suffer consequences for what they did to you and the other men. Easy for me to say, obviously, but it's infuriating to think of those bastards getting away with that and just going on with their life, and I don't even know anyone involved",

I\u2019m not saying I could have, or would have. What I\u2019m saying is, no one came to my tent and asked.\u201d\n\nThe filmmaker(s) fabricated it from whole cloth\n\n\nAs to the question of Boukreev: Reinhold Messner himself criticized him, saying no one should ever guide on Everest without supplemental oxygen.

She was captured after fighting off scores of dirty, filthy Muslim radicals. She's injured and is dragged into a hospital where's she's beaten and raped and interrogated for days!!\n\nTurns out none of it was true. She was just captured and given medical care.  She wasn't raped or beaten. Navy seals \"stormed\" a literal abandoned building. They were shooting at nothing. She openly contradicted the media and government claims of hey being Rambo.\n\nShe was a blonde young white girl, who was the center of a propaganda campaign to bolster support for a bullshit war that never should've happened in the first place. It's so blatantly obvious and corrupt it makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills that stories of Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch are just forgotten. And no one remembers the rabid mouth-frothing reaction we had.",

Actually coverups usually come to light because it is hard to get lots of people to consistently lie about something. The bigger the lie the more people involved. Think of the USS Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, conintel pro, watergate, NSA domestic spying program, etc.  People are unpredictable and bad as keeping secrets, lots of people doubly so. Pat Tillman was killed by friendly fire, it looked bad for the US to have killed an athlete that left his sport to fight in a war, and it would be better propaganda if he died in combat. So they said he did, until they couldn\u2019t anymore. A chaotic world is scarier than a world with magical puppet masters.",

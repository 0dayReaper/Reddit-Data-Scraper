They will talk about the sanctity of life all day, but that doesn't even touch on the complexity and nuance of the issue. \n\nSomething that I was anecdotally told recently is that some pro life people will be situationally and temporarily pro choice when they find themselves in a situation where they need to get an abortion. While telling the doctors and nurses giving them an abortion that they're going to hell, because her situation is clearly different than all those others.",

They are nothing but rude and only invite us so they can make fun of us behind our back and sometimes very much in front of us. They literally won't even talk to me. But it's important to my partner so here we are risking covid so that we can eat dry turkey and hear about all the money they spend on each other.\n\nEdit: since I got a decent amount of replies and one hate pm. My partner has a lot of emotional issues surrounding his family and how much his parents take care of his other siblings while ignoring him. We've had a lot of hard times over the past couple years and they couldn't even be bothered to have a meaningful conversation with him about it. When coronavirus hit we were in the middle of a move and lost our rental as I suddenly lost my source of income. We asked if they would let us stay in one of the empty homes they own and we would pay rent. They told us no because we are liberals/not christians and they wouldn't want to share what God rewarded them with us. There were two weeks where we seriously thought we might be living in our car. Since then they bought his sister a home for her 21st birthday. They also gave their childhood home to his older sister. They own two other properties they have inherited and rent out (one that was empty when we were almost homeless). \n\nWe have a kid together and they really just want to spend time with him and my partner. Basically since the election has ended they have invited us to Thanksgiving, Christmas and an all expenses paid vacation to Mexico (in January). I told him as long as the numbers are low where we live we can do family functions, which had us doing a two hour visit every other month. I pre said no to Christmas and the trip to Mexico. But my partner guilted me that we have to do Thanksgiving or they'll think we're purposely snubbing them over the virus/election. This runs especially deep as the rift between our families really started when I found out my partners nephews weren't vaccinated during a measles outbreak and said we couldn't get together because my newborn couldn't get his vaccine. Since then medical/political issues are extremely sensitive. So despite being very careful in all other instances we are going to his parents new vacation home (bought last month) for Thanksgiving, despite my objections.",

By weakening and reducing the number of strong men you reduce the strength of a country bc a country needs strong men to survive and the east knows this. \n\nThis is not my opinion. In fact my opinion of seeing Harry styles in a dress was \u201ccool fashion choice that affects me in no way whatsoever why is this newsworthy. Wear whatever you want\u201d but what I just said is literally what Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens said. Look up the tweets. It was wild to read.",

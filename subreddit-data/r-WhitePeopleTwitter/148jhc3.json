Jfc it's not that hard to pay attention while driving, do it. I live in an area wh re the person in front is always texting, talking while outrageous swinging their hands, or talking to their brood of children, but never paying fucking attention. I will honk lightly at you to let you know you're a jerk and need to fucking move. It's not about the .74 secs, it's about the light. Especially if it's a left hand turn, that shit is over quick, one person being a tart at the front putting on makeup instead of going, makes us miss the fucking light you jerk.",

I have been honked at on a light only once in my life, and exactly for that same reason, because I got distracted. But my reaction wasn't \"fuck you, how dare you\", it was \"oh shit, my bad\", because I'm not egotistical asshole.\n\n\"Oh no, you're losing 30 seconds of your life\" some white knight will inevitably spurt out like a ruined orgasm, proud at the brilliant putdown.\n\nFor all the geniuses who think that:\nRoads have a capacity. Lights are timed to match that capacity. At peak hours, that road is at or beyond it. So any dipshit sitting there for 20 seconds limits the throughput of that junction. If the road was at capacity, that causes a backup. If there already was a backup, it makes ot worse.\n\nA few dipshits doing the same thing at several intersections cause city wide traffic jams.\n\nSo stop sniffing your own farts and just fucking go when the light turns green.",

Then of course there's &gt;!the protomolecule, but that's meant to be completely beyond our current understanding!&lt;.\n\nOther than them the only big one would be special effects doing things like making Jupiter bigger than it actually would be but it's otherwise fine(and ignorable). There's other future tech there but it's normally fairly conservative in what it can do(mostly things related to life support and medicine) usually just slight stretches from modern tech that are realistic to be developed in the next 300 ish years. They're pretty good at making sure any future tech doesn't play a story role beyond making long spontaneous space flight possible.",

I powered thru S.1, S.2 definitely showed improvement on the weakest elements.  \nS.3 really picked it up and the storylines started to resonate with present society, the key to good science fiction serials. Character nuances emerge and deepen the audience takeaways.  \nS.4 they found the core of most of the stories, good threading between, characters really seemed to clarify - I thought there was much meandering and forced drama prior, but now overcome.  \nTech: The look is pretty bright and crisp. I'd like more shadows and mood. SFX are VG.  \nIt's not \"Amazing!\" (I'd give that to The Handmaid's complete universe, for reference), but Expanse is definitely on the fast track to must-see science fiction, well worth a dedicated binge.",

A world history class will lump all that together while a medieval history class likely won't.\n\nI doubt the Crusades and WWII would be lumped together in the future since it's unlikely they'd be classified in the same time period, but I could see WWII being lumped in with events such as the siege of belgrade which is related to the crusades.",

Ancient history is from about 3000 BC until 500 AD. I'm curious which periodization you are using.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I totally agree with your point. I think it's highly unlikely that modern, industrial wars like the world wars will be grouped together with conflicts like the crusades, for a lot of reasons.",

In fakt I served in the \"General-Feldmarschall-Rommel-Kaserne\".\n\nBut I would draw a line, when people would want to build statues of Rommel.

Grant's reply was basically \"Sure, as long as you also return our black POWs.\" Lee balked because 1) he was a racist piece of shit, 2) he massacred black soldiers who tried to surrender, 3) black soldiers who weren't massacred were often sold into slavery, and 4) he was a racist piece of shit. The prisoner exchange never happened. Six months later, Lee surrendered.  \n\nTL;DR [Robert E. Lee was a racist piece of shit.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/)",

His bomb went off 13 minutes after Hitler left the area. If the event hadn't been pushed up by half an hour, and Hitler hadn't cut his speech from two hours down to one to take the train instead of a plane (as fog was predicted), Elser probably would have succeeded in assassinating Hitler and much of the Nazi leadership on the 8th of November, 1939. Instead, in the 13 minutes between Hitler ending his speech and the bomb going off, the [B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCrgerbr%C3%A4ukeller) which had been packed with 3000 Nazis went to having only 120 people still in it; 7 were killed instantly, 1 mortally wounded, and 62 injured.  \n\nAfter his arrest 25 meters from the Swiss border fence, George Elser was interrogated, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, drugged, tortured, hypnotized, tortured, then imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and at Dachau. He was shot dead in Dachau on the 9th of April, 1945 - four weeks before the end of World War II in Europe. In spite of repeated torture, Elser maintained to the end his claim that he had carried out the attack completely alone, in order to save the working people and the entire world from war. Elser said he \"*wanted to prevent by my act even greater bloodshed.*\"",

The myth of the \"clean Wehrmacht\" (e.g. the Wehrmacht not having been systematically involved in war crimes and genocide) was a thing all the way up to the 1990s.  \n[Example: just 2 weeks ago, a base named after WW2 fighter ace Helmut Lent was renamed (in German)](https://augengeradeaus.net/2020/06/nach-jahrelangem-streit-neuer-name-fuer-die-bisherige-lent-kaserne/)  \n\n\nThat's not to mention all the former Nazis in the (Western) German administration, judiciary and politics. Famous examples are Kurt Georg Kiesinger (NSDAP member and later chancellor), Hans Filbinger (pushed through a death sentence for a 'deserter' - in April '45, later long-term governor of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) or Reinhard Gehlen (military intelligence officer in the Wehrmacht, later founder of the Federal Foreign Intelligence Service - to which he brought a lot of 'old boys' from SD and SS).",

And then every other year there is a discussion on whether we should rename this street or that square because it was apparently named after a Nazi or someone close to the NSDAP or it's Ideology.\n\nThe difference to America is that we do not keep this Names because we honor the eponym, but because we simply forgot about them.",

The segregation came soon after. So a lot of black people had to go back to their ex-owner to ask them for a job, where they would be paid dirt, and taxed on that money. Which is why, to this day, a large part of Afro-Americans are still poor.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there, because unlike slaves, ex slave-owners were compensated. And paid their ex-slaves employee with that money. Meaning that people who used to be slaves in the South had to work in terrible conditions in order to survive and get the money they would be rightfully entitled to after what is still one of the biggest human crime.\n\nHow fucking cruel and sadistic is that?",

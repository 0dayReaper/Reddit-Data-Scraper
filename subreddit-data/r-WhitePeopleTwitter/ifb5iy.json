Religion is declining steadily.\n\nPeople believing in God isn't inherently bad. Organized religion is a different story though, as it's been at the heart of many atrocities of mankind. But debating your friend and trying to logically explain away God is an exercise in futility.\n\nThe best thing to do is just encourage logical and rational thinking. Seems like a lot of people turn to religion just trying to be good people. I'm sure many people in this world feel, justifiably, unworthy of establishing their own moral doctrine. Sadly religion is the institution in place for people to turn to in search of a moral compass, as there are no community figures that preach philosophy and logic.",

You never set out to prove your hypothesis because 1: You have a bias to do that and 2: That is pretty much impossible.  Instead you test your null hypothesis that the hypothesis you have proposed about a phenomena can be explained by literally anything other than your hypothesis and therefore your hypothesis is invalid.   You want your null hypothesis to therefore be wrong.",

They like euphemisms like \"globalists\" now sometimes. My dad, a conspiracy theory lite kinda guy, could not for the life of him tell me what a globalist was. All he could muster was something about giving up sovereignty for world govt. I said \"like the EU\"? He said yes. So i asked again.. \"So you're just against the EU?\". He said \"you just dont want to get it\". But if he can explain what \"it\" is then...???",

A majority expressed either a \"great deal\" or \"some\" confidence in the scientific community throughout the survey period.\n\nand \n\n&gt; Brossard says increasing concerns among scientists over science becoming partisan are not reflected in recent GSS polls, which show fairly modest differences between Democrats' and Republicans' confidence in the scientific community.

Several online courses, even free ones, that I have taken over the years are better than any class in college. Doesn't apply to all fields but education should count no matter where you got it. \nI took microeconomics in highschool, college didn't accept it so I took it again. My MBA requires everyone take theirs, so I had essentially the same class 3 times, paying for two of them and learning nothing.",

We have to choose our major when we *apply* for university places and that subject makes up all of our classes when we do attend uni.\n\nEven our final two years of HS (ages 16-18) are specialised. We have GCSE exams at age 16 which are general education, covering most subjects. Our GCSE results determine what 'A-Levels' we can take for our final 2 years of HS. We take 3-4 A-Levels of our choosing and that's it, they needn't be maths/english/science.\n\nFor example, as an engineer you'll have taken Calc 1 at college in the USA (I think?).  In the UK Calc 1 is HS material taught at ages 16-18 to only those who choose the Maths A-Level. You'd then need a good Maths A-Level grade to be accepted to study Engineering at university.\n\nI think our A-Level content is roughly equivalent to 1st year college gen eds.",

Seminars, guest speakers, regular meeting with tutors who monitor student progress etc. It's basically all there to aid students in forming such decisions. Some still don't have an idea, but then there's routes for that as well:\n\n- You can have an idea and do your a-levels within the same school as you did general ed\n\n- You can have an idea and do your a-levels within a college seperate to the school you did gen ed\n\n-  You can leave school completely at 16, work for 1 or 2 years and then choose to go to a college to do your a-levels\n\n- You can do a-levels at your school and then after a year choose to do different a-levels at a college (what I did)\n\n- And a few other routes\n\n(our college and university are different things as well. A college here is just a learning institute that specialises in a-levels education and is seperate to secondary schools)\n\nEdit: formatting",

What happens if you are 16, and choose to go one path, for example, an engineering degree, but you get halfway through and more mature, and decide that's not your thing and you decide to change to psychology or something  not entirely related? How long would that set you back?\n\nI have a BS in US, but had to choose an elective degree known as Interdisciplinary Studies because I went to community college, and got an associate's degree in Business, but by the time I went to university I had changed my mind and decided to pursue education. About 20% of my credits would not have transferred into an education major, so I had to settle for the elective degree.",

At this point you will be given a timetable of lectures, seminars, and tutorials that would be directly related to that field of study. \n\nLast academic year we did: Applied mathematical methods, structures etc. At no point do we get to chose the modules in which we study but just get marked on these modules be it either by testing or assignments or a mixture of the two.",

They let two group of kids play games two times a week for four weeks. One group played the videogame, the other group played word search. The group that played videogames reported better subjective feelings than the group that played word search and... that's it. All the other **objective** measures in the study found no statistical difference between the groups.\n\nAnd this experiment was run by many qualified doctors and its results were approved by the many qualified doctors in the FDA.\n\nSo yeah, a group of 10 or 50 doctors can still produce bullshit if they make an effort. The only real cure for bullshit is reproducibility and a deep theoretical understanding of the effects being studied.",

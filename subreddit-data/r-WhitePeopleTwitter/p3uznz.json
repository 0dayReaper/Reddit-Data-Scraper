But, BUT , as time goes on I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not about me right now. It\u2019s about the healthy ones around me. I am ok with it, kinda . I do talk to a therapist about everything going on and he introduces me to the changes I am about to face. And I view that I was gradually came into this new life. There are people who suddenly had a new life. Military, police, accident victims and so on. I am able to adjust things to come. These poor people woke up to a new life. I am very, very blessed on that part no doubt.",

Not because they didn\u2019t follow our plan, but because dialysis only replaces UP TO 15% of kidney function and they can\u2019t get on the transplant list because of the medical system. One of my patient\u2019s access is very difficult to cannulate and may fail. He can\u2019t go get it looked at and cleaned out because it will cost him 1k. He doesn\u2019t have it.

Taking down the system will require government action being forced by the people. However, if you ask people what the root causes are, you'll find that they either don't really know or won't agree. Meanwhile, insurances are gaming healthcare costs to rise while raking in the proportional extra profits. \n\nI used to hate Bernie's *Medicare for All* plan just by the name (Medicare is a major antagonist of enabling the gamification of healthcare by insurance entities), but aside from the misnomer, it would have excised the roots and costs would have equilibrated. It was a *good* plan. Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act filled insurance coffers. We gotta cut the head off.",

By then, the damage was done; it turns out I have neurogenic bladder and urine had been backing up into my kidneys for three years, damaging them significantly. The kidney disease caused high blood pressure when I was 6, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 2006, and I've since had a heart attack and three arterial blockages (one stented, two treated with medication). I've had four surgeries on my spine, plus multiple abdominal surgeries. I just turned 40.\n\nI have a little over $2,500 left to pay on my heart attack bill (my portion was originally close to $10,000). The medical supplies I need to use daily are only covered 50% by my insurance company, so I ended up having to buy them online because by the time the medical supply company charges its inflated rate to my insurance company, it costs me more to pay half the price there than it does to pay 100% of the price online out of my own pocket. I have to pay for seven prescriptions per month. Now I've been diagnosed with a premalignant blood disorder that has required two bone-marrow biopsies. The first time I had it done, it cost me $1700+. The second time, the hospital part cost me $426, but the bastards sent my marrow to an out-of-network pathology lab, so I'm supposed to owe $2,600 for that. I am fighting with them now.\n\nIt's all a big scam.",

            "comment": "My daughter went for her Covid vaccine. She told them several times that she passes out from needles. She told them several times she needed to lay down in order to receive the injection. They told her \u201cyou\u2019ll be just fine\u201c they gave her the injection, she passed out. They use two ambulances to transfer her to the emergency room which was literally about 200 ft from where she got her injection.(she got her injection at one of the top hospitals in the state, so she was in a hospital. And they used two ambulances to literally take her 200 feet)\nI wasn\u2019t with her, she is in her late 20s, should\u2019ve been something she could\u2019ve handled on her own, but they freaked out and made her go to the ER.\nSo long story short after all of that she had to pay $2800 in ambulatory fees(out of pocket)\n\u2026\u2026 and she has great insurance!\nThieving bastards\n\nEdit\u2026. \nI pulled out the actual invoices and the ambulance charges were originally $4600-\nBecause they have to call two ambulance services by law-first ambulance that arrived did the transfer.\nEach one invoiced Insurance company and that apparently got applied to her deductible-\nWhich is why she is still being billed for it.\nAs of right now she\u2019s not paying it, because after talking to someone apparently these things cannot be applied to your credit rating.\nThe ER charge was well over $5000\u2026 Which the insurance company paid in full.\n\nMy point of this being that she asked to be put down on a stretcher when given the vaccination, they did not follow her request and as a result was charged close to $10,000 for something that was completely avoidable. And I still think they\u2019re a bunch of thieving bastards-",

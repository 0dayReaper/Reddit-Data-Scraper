Have literally had that happen to me at Alexander Springs, but it was after a 4-day hike while camping rough, so my feet were very happy to be exfoliated by tiny fish! And of course there were all the times at parks when I overheard tourists scornfully saying that the somnolent alligators must be stuffed, then shrieking like tiny children when the gators moved.\n\nI wonder if the interviewee was Carl Hiaasen. Sounds on-brand for him, and who better to skewer his own state?",

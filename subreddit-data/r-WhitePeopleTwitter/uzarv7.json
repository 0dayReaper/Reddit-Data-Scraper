The literal supreme fucking Court has said that the cops have absolutely no duty to protect you or anyone else.\n\nPolice do not carry weapons on them to protect others. They have them to protect themselves. The argument is that they get to do that because they may have to go into dangerous situations. But, everybody else can too.\n\nA fundamental thing that everybody is forgetting and still hasn't realized is that the police force is made of civilians. They are 100% civilians. They are people doing a job that are just like everyone else in are awarded absolutely zero privileges in doing so.\n\nMeaning that if you believe the police need to have firearms, then that exact same argument is valid for everyday people. Now, do you need to carry one everywhere? No. Does the policeman need to carry one everywhere? Honestly fucking no.\n\nThe level of training is absurdly low. Especially for allowing somebody to carry a firearm in public.\n\nIn my state the amount of training you need for your concealed weapons permit is more than what the fucking police need to carry everywhere... Including special privileges to carry into other places without worry of being in trouble for possessing it there.",

                                    "comment": "I\u2019m 14 and terrified. No school shootings have really happened in my area, but that\u2019s how it always is, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just a normal day and then it\u2019s not. \n\nI was in kindergarten when Sandy Hook happened. My mom didn\u2019t want to send me to school. I remember her crying one morning because she didn\u2019t want to let me leave. When there was a code yellow in kindergarten, she drove there the second she heard about it and tried to run in the school to get me, but she was stopped. That night, she clutched onto me for two hours straight. Parents didn\u2019t let their kids ride the bus anymore. They installed a security system and kids could only leave the school with a parent who got out of the car, but they weren\u2019t allowed on campus until they were ID\u2019d. We had no idea what was going on and it was so scary.\n\nIn middle school, it felt like there was a new school shooting every week. It was all I heard about. We had a drills at every time of the day and kids sobbed as we arranged desks to prepare for a possible shooter situation. Every time I saw a new article about a shooting, I would cry in bed. I faked sick because I was too scared to go to school. I missed so many days I nearly failed the grade, but being in that building was torture. Any loud noise made everyone jump. We all kept our eyes on the door. Kids were too scared to go to the bathroom, as we were told we\u2019d be locked out of the classroom if we were in the hallway during a shooting. \n\nNow, in high school, we have shooter drills every two weeks. The school is downtown so there are just about 3 code yellows (someone possibly dangerous in the area) every two months or so. Cops line the hallways. There\u2019s talk of teachers starting to carry guns. Multiple teachers/administrators at my school have expressed how far they would go to protect us, saying that they would die before they let anyone hurt us. We\u2019ve questioned if we could survive drops from the 3rd floor. I\u2019ve been next to classmates as they sobbed, even just imagining that a drill is real. I\u2019ve seen my friends freak out and nearly break down worried about their siblings whenever there\u2019s a code yellow. Bigger kids like athletes have said that they\u2019d stand in front of the shooter if it came to that. They search every person that comes in the building. \n\nYou wanna know what they\u2019ve done since this shooting? More guns. Some cops carry rifles now and they\u2019ve nearly doubled in number. They stop every single person. They walk with me when I\u2019m outside the building alone. We\u2019re not allowed to eat lunch outside anymore. And more and more guns. Guns do not make me feel safer. Seeing hallways full of rifles and cops standing outside, hands positioned on their belt as they watch us leave school does NOT make me feel better. I\u2019m so fucking scared and no one\u2019s doing anything about it. I DONT WANT MORE GUNS. For the love of god please stop this. I can\u2019t even do anything about. Have politicians supervise one school shooter drill and if they still think guns aren\u2019t the problem then I don\u2019t even know what to do. \n\nI\u2019m almost numb at this point. That feeling of fear so intense you want to throw up but you\u2019re too busy sobbing is so familiar it almost doesn\u2019t affect me anymore. My fear means nothing. Every time another shooting happens, I just go cold inside. I feel empty. Tears come out of my eyes, my chest tightens as my heart cries out in pain, but my face doesn\u2019t move. This is expected now, it doesn\u2019t surprise me anymore. \n\nMy first shooter drill was in preschool, we all cried. We all cried in kindergarten, too. And 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and older. Nothing\u2019s happened. No one cares. Our tears are lost on the deaf ears of greedy politicians and brainwashed civilians. I\u2019ve lost all hope that things will ever change. What about my constitutional right not fucking die?\n\nEdit: Yes, I know the statistics. I know that it is very unlikely that there will actually be a shooter at my school. That\u2019s not my point. My entire life at school has been dominated by the fear of school shootings. Despite the likelihood of each, we have more frequent shooter drills than we do fire drills. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve been next to multiple students as they sobbed, I\u2019ve seen kids try to suppress screams because they have to be quiet, I\u2019ve seen people draw out maps of the school layout to find escape routes, I\u2019ve seen students trying to memorize certain pathways to escape the quickest, I\u2019ve seen so much fear in my classmates and myself that shouldn\u2019t be there.\n\nThis fear was instilled in us. When you have shooter drills every other week, when you\u2019re told to never to go outside, when you can\u2019t go to the bathroom because it\u2019s too dangerous, when parents are too scared to let you ride the bus, when there are cops outside carrying guns for your protection, are you supposed to *not* be scared? Yeah, just ignore it right? I agree that it\u2019s irrational if you look at it from numbers and statistics, when you\u2019re objective about it. But we don\u2019t have the luxury of being objective. This has been my whole life, this is something that was imprinted on me since my earliest days of school. I\u2019m glad you can sleep at night knowing that it most likely won\u2019t happen. I can\u2019t. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re irrational, over-emotional teenagers. \n\nThis is exactly the problem. People write off teenage protestors because \u201cthey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about\u201d. Fuck off. Yes, I do. Please, do not tell me to not be afraid. I am afraid. I\u2019m afraid and I\u2019m going to talk about it. Im afraid and you\u2019re going to hear my voice. You will not stop my fear with numbers. You will not silence my voice with statistics. Listen up because we\u2019re scared and we have a lot to say.",

And, in fact, **states like California, which have implemented a broad slate of liberal policies, have kept pace with their Western European counterparts.**\n\n&gt;The study, co-authored by **researchers at six North American universities, found that if all 50 states had all followed the lead of California** and other liberal-leaning states on policies ranging from labor, immigration and civil rights to tobacco, gun control and the environment, it could have added between **two and three years to the average American life expectancy.**\n\n&gt;Simply shifting from the most conservative labor laws to the most liberal ones, Montez said, **would by itself increase the life expectancy in a state by a whole year.**\n\n&gt;**If every state implemented the most liberal policies in all 16 areas, researchers said, the average American woman would live 2.8 years longer, while the average American man would add 2.1 years to his life. Whereas, if every state were to move to the most conservative end of the spectrum, it would decrease Americans\u2019 average life expectancies by two years. On the country\u2019s current policy trajectory, researchers estimate the U.S. will add about 0.4 years to its average life expectancy.**\n\n&gt;Liberal policies on the environment (emissions standards, limits on greenhouse gases, solar tax credit, endangered species laws), labor (high minimum wage, paid leave, no \u201cright to work\u201d), access to health care (expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, legal abortion), tobacco (indoor smoking bans, cigarette taxes), gun control (assault weapons ban, background check and registration requirements) and civil rights (ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, equal pay laws, bans on discrimination and the death penalty) all resulted in better health outcomes, according to the study. For example, researchers found positive correlation between California\u2019s car emission standards and its high minimum wage, to name a couple, with its longer lifespan, which at an average of 81.3 years, is among the highest in the country.\n\n&gt;\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking for explanations, we need to be looking back historically, to see what are the roots of these troubles that have just been percolating now for 40 years,\u201d Montez said.\n\n&gt;Montez and her team saw the alarming numbers in 2015 and wanted to understand the root cause. What they found dated back to **the 1980s, when state policies began to splinter down partisan lines.** They examined 135 different policies, spanning over a dozen different fields, enacted by states between 1970 and 2014, and assigned states \u201cliberalism\u201d scores from zero \u2014 the most conservative \u2014 to one, the most liberal. When they compared it against state mortality data from the same timespan, the correlation was undeniable.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe can take away from the study that **state policies and state politics have damaged U.S. life expectancy since the \u201980s,\u201d** said Jennifer Karas Montez, a Syracuse University sociologist and the study\u2019s lead author. **\u201cSome policies are going in a direction that extend life expectancy. Some are going in a direction that shorten it. But on the whole, that the net result is that it\u2019s damaging U.S. life expectancy.\u201d**\n\n&gt;**U.S. should follow California\u2019s lead to improve its health outcomes, researchers say**\n\n&gt;**Meanwhile, the life expectancy in states like California and Hawaii, which has the highest in the nation at 81.6 years, is on par with countries described by researchers as \u201cworld leaders:\u201d Canada, Iceland and Sweden.**\n\n&gt;**From 1970 to 2014, California transformed into the most liberal state in the country** by the 135 policy markers studied by the researchers. It\u2019s followed closely by Connecticut, which moved the furthest leftward from where it was 50 years ago, and a cluster of other states in the northeastern U.S., then Oregon and Washington.\n\n&gt;West Virginia ranked last in 2017, with an average life expectancy of about 74.6 years, which would put it 93rd in the world, right between Lithuania and Mauritius, and behind Honduras, Morocco, Tunisia and Vietnam. Mississippi, Oklahoma and South Carolina rank only slightly better.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s those states that moved in a conservative direction, researchers concluded, that held back the overall life expectancy in the U.S.\n\nhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/04/liberal-policies-like-californias-keep-blue-state-residents-living-longer-study-finds/",

If anything, becoming a parent has made this all the more horrifying. Since my daughter's birth I've become so much more sensitive to children suffering in any form. I didn't know it was possible to love another human being as much as I love my daughter. Losing her for any reason would destroy me in a way that I don't think I'd ever recover from. I can't even beging to imagine how much more horrible it would be if I knew my daughter died scared and alone, abandonded by the adults who were supposed to keep her safe. If my inaction had caused 19 sets of parents to have to experience such soul crushing pain, I wouldn't be able to live with myself. If my inaction caused 19 children with their whole lives ahead of them to suffer and die violently, I wouldn't want to be able to live with myself.\n\n\nI hope those cops are ashamed of themselves.

I've needed the police three times in my life and all three times they either did nothing or made the situation worse/harder.  \n\n1) When I was 17 my cousin and a guy around the corner stole my Playstation 2, games, and about $200 worth of coins from me. My cousin and his friend *confessed* and told us exactly where the Playstation was.  The cops said it was too dangerous to go in that neighborhood to get it back and I'd just have to take my cousin to small claims court. \n\n2) My house was broken into when I was 19.  I was home and they pried open the security door with a crowbar before kicking in the deadbolted main door.  My dog and I scared them off before calling the police.  One officer came, told me I should've had the porch light on, said it wasn't worth filing a report since nothing was stolen (nevermind my broken doors I guess,) and left.  After he was gone we discovered that the porch light WAS on.  The burglar had unscrewed the bulb. \n\n3) My car was stolen when I was about 23?  I didn't even realize it was gone at first because I lived in an apartment and had been inside all day.  When I went outside that afternoon and saw it was gone, I called the police.  They came over, told me that it had already been located, wrecked about a block from where I lived.  They accused me of drinking and driving, wrecking it myself, and then walking home to call them.  Then they impounded the car for almost a month since it was involved in a \"hit and run...\" on a tree.  Wouldn't even let the insurance adjuster look at it.  \n\nThe police are fucking useless.  And tbh I feel like I got off lightly in my interactions with them after seeing how they treated people like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.  Probably because I'm white.  If I'd been black or brown, they would've arrested me when my car was stolen instead of just saying they thought it was me.",

We don't need you AT all. I was always mad at my school resource officer (circa 1999, I was very jumpy from the Columbine murders) for continuing to direct traffic when he knew a fight had just broke out. He didn't need to direct traffic, it wasn't that complicated, it was just about letting busses out, there was no intersection or anything. A kid's adult brother had come to pick him up, grabbed a baseball bat out of his truck, and ran to join the beating of some child. \n\nI was mad because I thought -we all thought- that the school cop was there to prevent violence. They don't prevent or stop anything because that's not their job. They let us think that's why they are there, now it's on us, we can't act like we don't know anymore.",

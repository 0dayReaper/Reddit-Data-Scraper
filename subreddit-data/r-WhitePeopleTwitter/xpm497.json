Liberal-leaning troops are mostly smart enough to not engage with them about it, because those people are often in positions of power that can make your life hell, even damage your career.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed the higher up the chain a person is on the enlisted side, the more free they feel to openly rant about conservative talking points in the workplace. I\u2019ve never seen an officer do that, no matter how junior or senior. Probably because they\u2019re better-educated about professionalism in the workplace and are expected to keep up a certain face no matter their personal opinions.\n\nVocal liberals make a bad reputation for themselves quickly within the unit. Vocal conservatives will seek you out to pick fights.\n\nThe most insufferably politically belligerent people also tend to be unvaccinated, but many of them have managed to avoid getting kicked out by stalling using various appeals. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many of them suddenly because devoutly religious when the religious exemption process became known, lol",

They viewed Russia as far left back then, and now it's far right. So it's aligned with them now more than even the US is, and so they love it more than the US. Nothing about them changed.

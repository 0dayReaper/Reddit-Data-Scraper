Sunday mornings were the absolute worst, lots of large orders that people would bring with them to church. Some of these people were absolutely terrible. There was one guy who would come in each week and order about 10 dozen donuts and want to pick out different flavors (which in general is fine). We asked him to start calling in his order the day before and we could have them ready when we came in - he wouldn\u2019t have to wait plus we\u2019d be sure to have the type of donuts he wanted. But he refused and instead would take a full half hour each Sunday to pick out his donuts, and get insanely mad if we had run out of a type he wanted. Every. Single. Week.",

I\u2019m talking defacing artwork, slashing sofas, damaging conference furniture, and generally being little assholes. The grownups would sit four to a table at our restaurants and ask for a salad to be split 4 ways then complain we shorted them. They would ask for a bunch of lemons, sugar and ice water since they were all free to make their own lemonade. They were also very rude to the staff unless they wanted something and wouldn\u2019t tip. I\u2019m glad we never sank to their level and argued with them. The staff was always firm and polite and it felt good to say we provided them with first class service regardless of what they put us through. Glad it\u2019s behind us now.",

I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, **against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages**, the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the Lord of hosts.\"\n\nSeriously.

One lady got upset because I told her she couldn\u2019t order off the 12 and under menu that she threw her water at me and then left. The irony that on the way out, she was hugging the priest coming in for lunch with another group. I made sure to follow her out, tell her in front of the priest she wouldn\u2019t be allowed back in, and then go back inside and watch her leave with a mortified look. My parents threw a fucking fit saying I was out of line, so I told them to find another waitress.",

For the entire 45 minutes they were there, it was all I could do to get orders and bring food and drinks to other tables because this table was CONSTANTLY asking for stuff. I'd bring something they'd asked for and they'd have another request before I left the table, over and over and over again. Extra napkins, cheese sauce, crackers, a replacement spoon because the kid had chucked his on the floor, refills, milkshakes they ordered late, on and on. By the time they left, the table (actually 3 pushed together) was a disaster. I grabbed a tub and went to bus the tables for the next customer and found no tip. Not necessarily a problem, people often pay with card or need change from paying cash to leave the tip. I was walking back with my first load when they left without returning to the table, but no worries because they paid with card. I asked the cashier how much they left... Nothing. Ugh.\n\nSo I go back and load up the tub for a second time, but the tables are still a mess of spilled milkshake and ketchup and soaked paper mats as I leave. On my way back though I see one of the customers from that table. He'd been in the bathroom and walked over to the table for his coat. He looked at the table, saw no tip and reached into his pocket to get some money out. I was pleased until I saw him retrieve a small handful of loose coins and toss them into a milkshake puddle on the table. 56 cents. Fuck all of them, but particularly fuck him. I hate the church crowds.",

It was a buffet-style place, so we worked mainly on bookings, and we were very busy on Sundays. \n\nThe pastor never called ahead to let us know if he was coming or how many people he would bring, so we\u2019d keep out an 8-seater for him AND leave a 4-seater empty in case he brought more people. So sometimes they were only 3 (and you dare not break the table down to seat 4 other people).\n\nAnyhow. He always came in shouting \u201cblessings, blessings!\u201d I once had the misfortune of serving them as their regular server was unwell, and they didn\u2019t even greet me. They wouldn\u2019t give me their drinks order because \u201cwe (the restaurant) know what they always have\u201d.\n\nOne day he called to book a table on another day (who says miracles don\u2019t happen?) and I picked up the phone. I addressed him as \u201csir\u201d, not pastor as everyone else does, and he promptly threw me the \u201cdo you know who I am? card\u201d. To which I replied \u201cYes, SIR, I do.\u201d He huffed \u201cClearly you don\u2019t\u201d and instructed me to get my manager (also my husband) to call him. \u201cYes, SIR, have a lovely day, SIR.\u201d It\u2019s been 12 years and it still makes me chuckle.\n\nThey were the tip of the iceberg. The rest of the Sunday crowd was just as rude, impatient, and self-absorbed. \n\nBut the hardest days I ever worked were Fathers\u2019 Days.

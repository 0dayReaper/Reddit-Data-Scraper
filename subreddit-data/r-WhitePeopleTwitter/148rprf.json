One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.\n\n- John Rogers",

So it's basically a sign that they've never grown up or grown out of being a child.\n\nAnyone who has grown emotionally since being a teen will recognise very quickly that libertarianism is fundamentally useless and will only ever make soceity worse.",

You're doing great and if other people aren't, it's probably because you worked so hard.

We don't need police, you can just get security! Slavery wouldn't exist if it was legal because people wouldn't want to buy from a company that used it!\n\nI saw myself as a \"rational\" libertarian. I believed social safety nets were bad because the costs wouldn't outweigh the benefits. Maybe they would be okay if you could target them specifically to those who would strictly benefit from them. After all, almost all of the spend is overhead and fraud, right? \n\nGoing to college and meeting a bunch of new people who didn't attend a private school really changed my opinion. Okay, that person benefited from access to Medicaid but they're an exception. And that person wouldn't be here if their mother couldn't get WIC, but that's not the norm. This person is very smart but couldn't afford to attend college without assistance, but they're a one-off. Yeah, this homeless person is only here because they lost their job, experienced a major mental breakdown, and didn't qualify for Medicaid treatment, but surely most aren't like that.\n\nI eventually reached a point where there were more exceptions than rules. By my junior year, I was mostly centrist, believing that some safety nets are needed and that protections for marginalized groups were usually necessary. When Trump ran for president, I realized the Republicans no longer represented the average American and voted Democrat. \n\nIt only took a few months after Trump's inauguration for me to almost completely flip my beliefs. Study after study showed that social programs not only provided a necessary security to those who needed it the most, but they also provided a positive economic return.",

The Free Market is the spherical chicken in a vacuum of economic models, it's a thought experiment that makes it easier to discuss a few basic ideas of economics, but real life is infinitely more complex.  Companies have to be incentivized and disincentivized to do the right things and not do the wrong things beyond what consumers are able to drive them to do.  \nThe second point I'd make is that sometimes being fiscally responsible means spending money.  Social safety nets, food stamps, WIC, Medicaid, public education, they're all net positives for the economy, they all put more money into the economy than we spend on them and we could spend a lot more on them and still be nowhere near the point of diminishing returns, with the added benefit of people not being destitute.  \nA lot of times, talking to Conservatives, Republicans, Libertarians, they get an idea of how things *should* be.  You tell them something is a problem and they say \"Well if things were like *this* that wouldn't be a problem,\" then they ignore the problem, they've got no solution, no intention of having a solution, beyond just declaring that in their fantasy world such a problem wouldn't exist.  You give them a chance to try to implement their fantasy world, like Kansas did not long ago, and you see it's a disaster.",

                    "comment": "They believe in the myth of individualism - that the only person you're responsible for, and the only person you owe anything to, is yourself. You fail or succeed only by your own effort and abilities. No one should be forced by the government to pay for anyone else's lack of effort or abilities, i.e. taxes. \n\nThis viewpoint completely ignores the fact that without the services provided by taxes, no one would have any economic success. Good luck having a successful business if there are no roads to drive on to deliver your supplies, or for your customers to get to you. No firemen to put out the fire if a rival businessman decides to burn down your store, and no justice system with laws to deter them from doing that. No educational system to make sure you have a pool of literate people to hire from.\n\nThe philosophy also ignores the fact that people don't start out on an even playing field. You can pretty accurately predict how successful someone's going to be just based on the zip code they were born in, regardless of their individual effort or talent. Successful people don't become successful because they make better choices: they become successful because they\u2019re born into a station in life where they get more \"second chances\" after making bad decisions. \n\nI do understand the appeal of the fantasy of individualism. To go out into some woods somewhere, live off the land, off the grid, just dip out of a society that has grown increasingly complicated and stressful. And there's nothing wrong with valuing hard work and self-reliance, as long as you recognize that people can work hard and try their best and still fail due to circumstances beyond their control, and that there's no shame in needing a bit of help sometimes. \n\nThe reality of humanity is that people are more successful when they work together than when they work alone. When we come together and support each other, we can all benefit from a greater variety of strengths and talents, so everyone doesn't *have* to work so hard to survive. That's the whole point of civilization/society/government: to organize a way to work together to make everyone's lives better. I think in many parts of the world we've lost sight of that.",

                                    "comment": "You're getting a lot of shallow, caricatured answers, from peoples who's conception of libertarianism is based off of reading the arguments of self professed libertarian keyboard warriors. \n\nSo allow me to add more nuance.\n\nLibertarianism originated in the 1800s, among thinkers who very munched influenced the founding fathers of the United States, and even included some of them. The original libertarian philosophy is still around, but these days its called [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism).\n\nThe gist of the philosophy was that a free market was better than a planned economy; that personal liberty and autonomy ought to be respected and maximized as much as possible; and as such, the power of the government should be constrained to clearly delineated areas. If you consider the time and place this philosophy came about, it makes a lot of sense: all of Europe was still ruled by kings, who exercised a great deal of arbitrary power over their subjects, as well as interfered with the economy at whim. \n\nNotice that these are general statements of principal, and _not_ clearly delineated policy positions. This is important.\n\nIn the modern age, there are both left-libertarians, and right-libertarians. \n\nThe _vast majority_ of people you encounter who self label as a libertarian are [right-libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-libertarianism), and usually pretty hardcore versions of them. These are the people who will say stupid shit like \"taxation is theft,\" and who think that basically all government services should be abolished in favor of private sector offerings. Like, welfare programs should be abolished, and replaced with private charities. These people have taken the whole \"personal autonomy\" position to an extreme point: some of them feel that the government using the threat of violence (arrest and imprisonment) to force them to pay taxes which are then used for activities they don't support is a fundamental violation of their personal autonomy. This is not exactly an _insane_ position; but taken to its logical extreme, it makes society unworkable. \n\nThe thing is, though, that this is an _extreme right_ libertarian position, but a lot of people think that this _is_ the libertarian position. This is like saying that Bernie Sanders represents the entirety of the democratic party. He represents _a_ view that is present in the party, but there's many others. There _are_ moderate right-leaning libertarians that support taxes to pay for government programs where a private sector solution just doesn't make sense. They usually get labeled as \"centrists,\" or \"corporate democrats.\" If you ever encounter someone who calls themselves a [classical liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism), this is what they are. These are libertarians in the style of the founding fathers and related thinkers. These people believe that there are things that _only_ the government can do, and so taxes are a necessary evil in order to fund the government's ability to pursue those goals. Generally, this will include the military, and some minimal interference with the free market in order to account for [market externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality), the FDA, etc. Public education is iffy, with some supporting and some not. \n\nAnd there are also [left-libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism). These people are generally skeptical of individual property rights, and/or tend to think along lines that privilege's the good of society over the good of the individual members. These people, though, more commonly go by labels like \"communist,\" or \"anarchists,\" depending on how extreme, exactly, their aversion to individual property is. \n\nIf we step back, and consider this from the distance, we can make sense of what superficially seems to be an internal contradiction.\n\nGenerally speaking, politics has two broad areas where we, as a society, have to figure out how to operate: the economy, and society. Democrats have left-wing economic policies (interfere with the market a lot for lots of reasons) and left-wing social policies (let people do what ever they want); and republicans have right wing economic policies (let the free market do what it will) and right wing social policies (enforce traditional values through legislation). Classical libertarianism had left-wing social policies (let everyone do what they want) and right wing economic policies (let the market do what it will). The question is, exactly how much will you interfere with the economy, and exactly how tolerant will you be of people's... quirkiness. \n\nAnd notice that that accounts for 3 of the 4 possible ways of choosing from an economic policy and a social policy. The remaining combination (left wing economic policy with right wing social policy) is basically authoritarianism: interfere with the economy a lot to achieve your political goals _and_ use legislation to control culture and society.",

It was terrible, we almost went under because once local outfits realized our guards weren't armed with anything stronger than threats to call the cops (who wouldn't show up for at least 8 hrs. even before COVID - thanks Dallas P.D.!), we were literally having multiple cars get hit for their catalytic converters every night.

There seems to be a victim mentality that has been spreading in recent years. Historically, men have been the sole providers and if they didn't take care of themselves then nobody would. Or at the least, that's the mentality that is often displayed.\n\nI know I personally see study after study that isolation and loneliness seems to disproportionately affect young single men. This loneliness coupled with this survivor mentality probably makes men more likely to believe that the government shouldn't give assistance to people. That we can govern ourselves without big government. After all, when you're lonely and isolated you tend to find ways to survive without the help of others. Also, tending to take for granted the institutions that have been built by society that make isolated survival viable to begin with. \n\nIt would be interesting to see how many of these libertarian men are single. It would be interesting to know how many of these men are living an isolated lifestyle. To me it's a little akin to incel culture, but obviously much more advanced and mature.\n\nAgain, I have no idea what level of truth there is to this, but these are just some thoughts that occur to me.",

He said after he transitioned he started immediately feeling lonely and isolated. He claimed the issue wasn't transphobia but just how differently men are treated compared to women. \n\nHe said when he still presented as a woman, people were generally friendly and open with him. But as a man, women were suspicious and guarded when he was around. Which, fair enough if I was a woman I would probably be the same way. Men didn't really interact with him in a positive way either.

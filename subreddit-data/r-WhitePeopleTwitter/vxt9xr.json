There was a scene with them at the house of young girl, maybe 8 years old, that had been abused by one or both of her parents. Not only were they recording what she had to say about what happened, but they were showing her face. Zero privacy for that poor child. I think I even remember them talking about how she\u2019d been sexually abused too. I was furious that Fox would actually air that without (at the very least) blurring her face. It was reprehensible.",

All to often when a new issue crops up instead of figuring out what should be done and who would best respond  and actually deal with the issue properly the answer is \"have the cops do it\". In the early days of ambulances it was the police who drove them, often it was officers that no one liked that got stuck doing it because no one liked doing it. It took years before they started using dedicated ambulance crews with some actual first aid training (and years more before highly trained paramedics came about, let alone started staffing the ambulances themselves).\n\nThe police should be but one of many tools in a city's toolbox but all to often they are the only one. They're the hammer and when all you have is a hammer everything looks like nails. There needs to be other tools in the toolbox.",

But it doesn\u2019t fit nicely on a piece of poster board at a protest.\n\nAnd let\u2019s end the absurdity of protecting police from personal responsibility when they make bad decisions. We should require personal liability insurance for law enforcement officers; and over time, the market will price bad cops out of the system.\n\nEdit: and oh yeah, can\u2019t we just end \u201cthe war on drugs.\u201d That war is over, the drugs won!

This is the main tenet of being a cop, the idea that that homeless dude smoking crack in an alley is an entirely different being than they are, but if they put him in jail he'll become a better person by their force of will. Just remember though, he'll never be fully like them because he already smoked crack in an alley, something they would never do \n\n\n\n* Being comfortable with being violent and inflicting violence on other people.\n\n\n\n* Eager to follow orders without question. This is why ex-military and very religious  people are such good candidates.  \n\n\nThey aren't required to be empathetic and if they're open minded they won't be a cop.  Like you won't find a cop that's like \"I did mushrooms once and saw so much beauty in the world and I realized we're all in this together\". The LEO culture doesn't welcome those kind of people. \n\n\n\n\nIt is never about serving and protecting. It's about legally enforcing one person's will upon another and breaking them down physically or mentally if they don't.",

People are focusing on how no one did anything(and fucking rightfully so) but blaming this one grunt cop ignores the bigger issue. These cops demonstrated they had no structure or plan. It seems more likely to me that all these didn\u2019t go in more so because of their lack of leadership and training than actual cowardice (not to say they weren\u2019t all huge cowards that abuse their power). As Uvalde clearly showed, the american police system needs a major rework with an emphasis on accountability, preparation, and non lethal de-escalation.",

CNN has been, in my humble opinion, almost equally as biased and opinionated as Fox when it comes to reporting on Trump finally catching federal charges.\n\nJust today I saw Jake Tapper and Van Jones (as examples) continuously making sarcastic remarks and just pouring their hatred toward Trump into their commentary.  That's not \"reporting the news\".\n\nCanadian news sources have major bias issues as well, but nothing compared to the US.  \n\nHowever we have pretty easy access to AP and Reuters (edit -- originally included BBC but realistically they're not in the same category as the other two) which are FAR less opinionated (Reuters specifically) on North American politics, so they just report facts and let the people decide what to think (to a large extent of course.  I understand no news is *entirely* unbiased).  I wish it was like that in the US as well, because this brainwashing-style 24-hour news cycle is not helping anyone and it's even trickling up here to Canada.. we have protesters with signs about the Constitution here in Toronto.. yes, the US Constitution.\n\n***EDIT*** --- I'm seeing lots of responses to this comment, which is awesome cuz I'm bored and love to converse.  However the last 35+ comments or so, they show up in my notifications but when I click on them, nothing.\n\n***Ps please DM me with a response if you know why I can't read any of the responses when I click them, cuz if you respond here.. I can't see your response.***",

And yet, we are dumb as fuck.\n\nI was writing and it was turning into a dissertation so I'll just say that the net has brought all the knowledge but also all the trash anyone can make up.\n\nWithout the ability to spot fallacious content, contradictions, and similar it's like having 1,000 textbooks for a college course but they all say something different to some degree or another. Anytime someone like that looks something up that's hotly contested they will end up picking what appeals to them or things they have been previously exposed to.\n\nUS schools up until recently, and even now, have had an extremely 'shut up, sit down, and don't question your teachers' approach. Critical thinking is taught more in passing and in context related to other subjects.\n\nIMO the issue is that we teach most people how to remember what they are told, not think for themselves. There are an alarming number of graduate degree holders who seem unable to think when a trusted source doesn't tell them what to think, like a textbook, colleague, or maybe some other 'trusted source' they've grown up with...\n\nCritical thinking ought to be a core class that is foundational, not supplementary, to the STEM courses through at least grade school. Teach them how to weed out bullshit and watch them become avid learners and the net become the source of knowledge it truly is under the shit.\n\nPS - It became long again, sorry.",

See, in the US, the predominantly slaveholding states and those with few slaves came to an impasse regarding whether slaves should count as population for the sake of apportioning representatives to Congress and such. Obviously it\u2019s not exactly fair to count slaves with no rights the same as anyone else, but the slave states were balking at the possibility of being outvoted by the more densely populated and urbanized states of the northeastern coastline of the early US (New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, etc). \n\nSo, enter the 3/5 Compromise. Slaves would be counted as 3/5 of a person for such apportionment needs. Dehumanizing and disturbing, but it was done in part to get said slaveholding states to agree to join the early US under the Constitution at all and ratify said document. Whether said compromise was a bitter concession to pragmatism and the reality of the situation with no good solutions (part of the drive for having -one- country from the former colonies was the thinking that it would be safer if the British came back to be standing together, which they indeed did in the War of 1812) or one of the worst mistakes the writers of said constitution (many of whom were slaveholders themselves while still preaching about liberty and inalienable rights and whatnot) made, is a tough question.",

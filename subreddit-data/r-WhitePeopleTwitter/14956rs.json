He hired his son-in-law and daughter to work at the WH, where they made millions and right afterward Jared got billions from the Saudis, where he admits he spent a lot of time \u201cworking\u201d for the president. When he lost, he tried to attempt a violent coup in DC and a political one by threatening officials in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin. Then Trump stole at least 60 boxes of nuclear secrets when he knew they\u2019d made him leave and kept them for over a year after he was nicely asked to return them.

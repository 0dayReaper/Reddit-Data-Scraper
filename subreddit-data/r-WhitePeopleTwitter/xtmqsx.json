I can walk one mile out my front door to the hills and find markings on the boulders where the natives would grind acorns. We visited the missions on field trips. It was always made clear that they were built by native labor. We learned more about the role the Spanish and the Catholic church had in it and not so much about what happened in other regions of the US.",

The worst part is that she is very much interested in indigenous culture and history. Her previous, private school was a downie-wenjack legacy school and they learned about indigenous people almost daily. She was SO excited to go learn more and tell me about it on Friday... but nothing. Not a single thing.\nI took her to a sacred fire sunrise ceremony that was held by our local native friendship centre before school-Trying to foster her interests as best I can because I know how much the public system lacks in doing that.. as I was let down a lot as a kid.

They didn\u2019t elaborate as I assume they didn\u2019t learn in great detail the horrors.

I was taught that Residential schools were schools just like mine, so we could give their kids skills and help them escape from poverty.

To a small kid it all seemed nice but it was all lies and I didn't know any better until it started being talked about more openly on tv. My childhood education of indigenous peoples was carefully curated to omit all the brutality of colonialism.",

This statement confuses me somewhat, how exactly do we (as a whole) gain benefit from Canada having residential schools?\n  \nIt appears there is no benefit whatsoever, as Canadian society is struggling with the issues of poverty, violence and addiction within indigenous communities as a result.  I can't see how these schools produced anything positive.\n  \nSome modern day Canadians may be descendants of people like Ryerson, Trutch, MacDonald, and others, but they are not responsible for the actions of their ancestors.  Sins of the father and all that.\n  \nWhat about immigrants?  We are modern day Canadians, but didn't have ancestors here who created residential schools, broke treaties, scooped children, and engaged in cultural genocide.  \n  \nThe people responsible were the Federal Government, RCMP, and the Catholic Church - especially the Catholic Church should be forced to pay reparations severe enough that it effectively destroys the Church's ability to function.\n\nTeaching about the ugly truths of Canadian history is important, but some kid in grade 4 whose parents came from India isn't responsible or accountable for what happened in the past, and neither are the caucasian kids.  The agencies responsible have to face consequences, a day of recognition and token white guilt isn't it.",

I would even say what we were told was a lot (graphically) to tell kids that age but I am a fairly sensitive person. I wonder if it was just a matter of more sympathetic teachers at the time? I think the 90s was a time of increasing sensitivity to Native Americans and even bordering fetishizing. \n\nWhat I learned in class about the boarding schools was more along the lines of erasing these people's culture and separating them from their families to prevent new generations from learning their heritage and languages. I don't recall learning about deaths and I didn't learn about child sexual abuse until I was an adult and came across the subject again.",

Meanwhile we were taught relatively little about the actual settlement and growth of Western states, beyond the basics of land grants, gold rush, Louisiana Purchase, and war with Mexico. \n\nAlso our history classes were pretty heavily dominated by slavery, the major wars, and post-WW2 civil rights.

Like you we quickly went over some of the western expansion and killing of Native Americans. A quick overview of the Trail of Tears and that was about it.\n\nAs an aside I will say Florida public schools were kinda shitty all around in their curriculum. I moved from NY to FL at the beginning of the fifth grade. Funny enough my mom was worried I might fall behind a bit since the move/getting settled had me taking off a couple of weeks of school (also because FL starts schools about a month earlier than NY). That wasn\u2019t a problem though as when I started going to school in mid November, the fifth grade class was learning things I had learned in the third grade. I remember being bored out of my mind especially in fifth grade and actually a good chunk of middle school.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to other people who moved from up north down to various parts of Florida when they were kids and they had similar experiences. This was in the 90\u2019s for me so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten any better. But with everything our Governor has been doing, the crap the local school boards have been pulling and the teacher shortage it sounds like it\u2019s just gotten worse.",

The report stemmed from an interview exchange between State Representative Sarah Fowler Arthur (R-Ashtabula) and a News 5 reporter in early March.\n\nDuring the interview, Fowler Arthur was asked about the financial aspect of the bill. While attempting to talk about funding, she brought up the Holocaust.\n\n\"You should talk about these atrocities that have happened in history, but you also do have an obligation to point out the value that each individual brings to the table,\" Fowler Arthur said.\n\n\"Maybe you're listening to it from the perspective of a Jewish person that has gone through the tragedies that took place,\" Fowler Arthur also said. \u201cAnd maybe you listen to it from the perspective of a German soldier.\"",

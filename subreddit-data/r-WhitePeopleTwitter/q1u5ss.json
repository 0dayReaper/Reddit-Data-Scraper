Generally they are local charities and the box stores want a good rapport with the community. \n\n[Here's](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/who-gets-tax-benefit-those-checkout-donations-0#:~:text=Assuming%20the%20business%20is%20following,on%20the%20store's%20income%20taxes.)

Think of it basically that since they're not collecting it as income, it's not going to be taxed. It's just a gift donation.\n&gt;\n&gt;How it could \"hurt\" you is that you could donaye and then write it off as an individual deduction. Except since most people just take the standard deduction, and never itemize their charity gifts then they miss out on it. That's really the point of standardized deductions though, to make it so you don't need to keep track or recipts and you probably come out ahead.\n&gt;\n&gt;The scummier thing could be the charity could be a branch of the corporation. For example, maybe the chairty is Whole Foods Cares (made up). And while non-profit regs makes sure that entity is separate, maybe that board is packed with Whole Foods boards friends and family... and maybe the charity's administrative fees are oddly high, so you're really just funnelling money into the CEO's wife's salary.\n\nI absolutely love having a higher standard deduction and not needing to itemize my taxes. I only did it the one year (first year of my mortgage and with the old much smaller deduction) and it was a pain in the ass. \n\nCost more to file that way for me and it took like 4x as long. No thanks, standard deduction and done please. \n\nI was actually arguing with an idiot the other week who claimed that an increased standard deduction meant most people were paying *more* in taxes because their \"refund was smaller\" all while completely ignoring dragging things like changes to withholdings, and y'know the fact average burden ahs gone down. Little things, like the facts. \n\nIdeally it would all just be standard deductions and none of the complicated spaghetti mess of tax code we currently have.",

Some of them are kinda random, like 50 cents off a bag of potatoes. I'd imagine other superstores have a similar app. \n\nAs a frugal jerk though, I highly recommend shopping with the app if you enjoy saving money like me! I went this morning and had a my total jump from $27 to $22. I live for the thrill of the thrift. I also try new foods more when the deals are too good to ignore.",

And every charity should give you the right to opt out and respect that.\n\nThat said, as someone who did a lot of fundraising for an amazing nonprofit. It\u2019s just a reality that they have to spend money marketing  and fundraising. Ours was an organization that was environmental legal battle against a multi-billion dollar organization. This company was corrupt, would but advertising for the high school football teams and donate equipment to them to win the families over, was making tons of backroom deals to hide evidence of destruction, etc.\n\nWhat would you have a small effort to stop them do? They need the resources and awareness to be raised to counter it. Legal representation, staff hours, materials, educational efforts, scientific research, etc. is not cheap. It\u2019s the reality of many charities that fundraising has to happen for them to function.\n\nI always told people it was my dream to tell them one day I didn\u2019t need their money anymore because we won our fight. I meant it. But until that day, we had to ask for support.\n\nI also get where you\u2019re coming from though. I\u2019m very cautious to support mostly small efforts that I can see the direct results of. I always look at a groups financials and history before donating. And we never sold our lists or anything of the sort.",

By partnering with these stores a charity gets their name and cause out there to an enormous amount of people AND provides an access point for direct donation.\n\nYeah, I totally understand that little twinge of \"really, you're asking ME for money?\" but it's this or those organizations have to find some other way to get your attention.

My grandmother was born just 2 years after he was and she was also happy to tell anyone right up until the final week of her life that she has a purpose here on earth and she doesn\u2019t have time to \u201cfeel old.\u201d\n\nGod I loved that woman beyond words.. she passed over this last summer. She was an extremely altruistic woman. She fought for civil rights in the 1960\u2019s in the south and she was a teacher during integration. She was so good at her job, connecting with students and making every individual feel respected and cared for that she was the only white teacher at an all black inner city school during the beginning of integration. I admire her work so much and I wish that her legacy could be shared with the world outside of a Reddit comment.. she was not a woman to take on accolades. She even turned down a spot to be on television and make her home economics class into a tv show (this is pre Martha Stewart) because she wanted to be on the front lines in the classroom during the fight for civil rights.\n\nShe told me about the day MLK was killed. She set up lemonade and cups that she bought with her own money (a common for her, she put her entire soul into caring for those kids) for the children to sip as they gathered to talk and comfort one another. The (white male) supervisor case into her basement classroom and demanded to know what was going on, told her not to let the students congregate.. my grandmother was not a woman who often showed anger, or any outburst of any kind really. She was truly a lady. But in that case she told him right off and let him have her fury. \u201cThese children are scared, confused, and hurting profoundly. They need to be allowed to be with each other, to talk and to have space and respect to deal with this tragedy. You have no right to speak in something you have no personal understanding of.\u201d And she told him to get the hell out of her classroom. (Never heard her say that word but she said that was one of the only occasions that she felt it was warranted.) He did it too because as I said, she was the only teacher who could fulfill the role she took on at the school. I really kind of wish she\u2019d taken the tv gig. We still have the newspaper feature where she and her husband (she was disowned and excommunicated by her rich family because my granddaddy wasn\u2019t all white) and my uncle are sat around a child\u2019s table looking like a picture perfect example of what the American values of compassion and tolerance might look like in practice..\n\nI do believe there is a generational aspect to it. She told me that when she was a young girl there was nothing because of the Great Depression but it didn\u2019t make her feel sad. It\u2019s just how she knew life to be. So she was quite happy in her simple beginnings and as she got older and the country banded together for the war effort I think my grandmother became inspired by her experiences to bring forth this energy of supporting the other people in our society with us. A strong team mentality vs the more current I get mine mentality.\n\nI find myself wondering if the generation that was growing up and coming of age just as the recession &amp; it\u2019s aftermath hit (so young millennials &amp; gen z) might end up with a similar mindset. I think capitalist greed over monetary gain still exists as a strong theme in American culture but I always read about how millennials care more about experiences than objects... and that is true of my grandmother too. All the better if that experience is productive and betters society. I hate to be that person but... we need an app for that.",

            "comment": "We got a Habitat home and it's a life changer.  They're not free homes BTW.  AMA and I'll try to answer.\n\nEDIT:  \n\n* The program has different rules in different areas, also a larger or smaller organization.  YMMV.\n\n* Your income (with spouse if applicable) has to be between $X and $Y.  I don't know that number but I'm sure circumstances factor in there.\n\n* You must be a first-time home buyer.\n\n* Credit doesn't matter but you must make payment arrangements with any creditors.\n\n* We put in 300 hours volunteering, 100 of which was construction which included framing, painting and sodding (laugh it up Brits).  You probably won't be working on your own home, you're helping your neighbors.  They later dropped it to 100 hours.  No regrets.\n\n* Several hours of mandatory classes, how to handle money, how to care for the landscaping, how to care for a home.  No, you can't bring the kids.\n\n* Down payment was covered by a silent-second mortgage, built into the main mortgage.  We brought about $750 for closing costs, based on income.\n\n* You get a brand-new home or one that's been gutted and made new.  New appliances too.\n\n* We got about 1,000^2 foot home, 3 bedrooms, 2 bath, 80' x 200' lot (1/3 acre). Number of rooms was based on having one child and one in the oven.  Most are going to be 3-bedroom.  Haven't seen a 2 or 4 bed.  Wife says it's 2 heartbeats per room, we have a boy and girl so they're not expected to share.\n\n* You don't get to pick your home, just the general area, probably where you live now.  First choice, take it or leave it.  Go to the bottom of the pile and get one more chance to accept.\n\n* You get to pick paint, siding, carpet or not, stuff like that.\n\n* Some things are as cheap as it gets, others are top notch.  The doorknobs suck.  The framing and insulation is well above code.  Foam insulation in the attic, leaves it all open to walk around or build storage, stays very cool.  Very nice windows.  They want a solid home that doesn't cost a lot to live in.  You can buy your own damned door knobs if you don't like it. :)\n\n* There are restrictions on the mortgage but they're not really enforced.  Example, we can't build a fence without approval.  Realistically, no one cares and it's a rubber stamp process.\n\n* You pay the actual cost of the home and land.  Ours was around $85K, $500\\mo. for 19 years, *interest free* mortgage.\n\n* If you're interested, give your locals org a call.  That easy.  You'll attend a talk and see if you want to pursue the program.  Took us a little under a year to do our time and get keys.\n\nEDIT: Forgot another thing.  The volunteer hours count for both you and your spouse and anyone who donates their hours to you.  A 4-hour day is worth 8 towards the total if you have someone help.  I had coworkers help and I donated my time to others when we got past the end.",

Are you competent enough to do something more useful than painting?\" \n\nSo I went from being heavily surprised painting a closet with a brush to fitting crown molding by myself after a couple check-ins with all the fun power tools required (nail gun, miter saw, etc).

They are class acts. \n\nThe start of the article: \n\n&gt; Jimmy Carter finishes his Saturday night dinner, salmon and broccoli casserole on a paper plate, flashes his famous toothy grin and calls playfully to his wife of 72 years, Rosalynn: \u201cC\u2019mon, kid.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; She laughs and takes his hand, and they walk carefully through a neighbor\u2019s kitchen filled with 1976 campaign buttons, photos of world leaders and a couple of unopened cans of Billy Beer, then out the back door, where three Secret Service agents wait.\n&gt; \n&gt; They do this just about every weekend in this tiny town where they were born \u2014 he almost 94 years ago, she almost 91. Dinner at their friend Jill Stuckey\u2019s house, with plastic Solo cups of ice water and one glass each of bargain-brand chardonnay, then the half-mile walk home to the ranch house they built in 1961.\n&gt; \n&gt; On this south Georgia summer evening, still close to 90 degrees, they dab their faces with a little plastic bottle of No Natz to repel the swirling clouds of tiny bugs. Then they catch each other\u2019s hands again and start walking, the former president in jeans and clunky black shoes, the former first lady using a walking stick for the first time.",

One of the luxury hotels in town had a sick hot tub area right along the base of the mountain. My friend and I were able to sneak ourselves into the hot tub area and were relaxing by ourselves when all of a sudden 4-5 guys in suits and ear pieces walk out and scope out the area. \n\nWe thought we were about to get kicked out since we weren\u2019t even guests in the hotel, but instead one of the guys came over and asked us if we\u2019d like to have the former president and his wife sit in with us. We were like \u201cok whatev\u201d when out walks Jimmy Carter and his wife. I had no real idea who he was (he was before my time) but we still thanked him for his service, had small talk about the area, and then we went on our way. \n\nHe was a super nice guy. I just wish I would have known more about him at the time. ",

We need you to make a decision\" \n\nI think the general perception was that Carter was a fantastic human being - but he lacked the mental fortitude to make hard life and death decisions....which is something you need to be president. \n\nCarter was honestly probably too pure for the presidency.

People don't like new things or people who come in with fresh ideas and stir things up (this was when advertising and corporate overlords were wringing out the last bit of resistance, Reagan was the final nail).  Now we're all good sheep. ",

Things weren't good when he was president and he told Americans they needed to rise up and be better and change certain things. We didn't like that so we kicked him out after 1 term and brought in Ronnie who basically just said, \"America kicks ass, you're the best, we rule, go America!\" and after the bummer that was the 70s, that's all we wanted to hear and we ate it up. \n\nThere's a lot of parallels between then and now.

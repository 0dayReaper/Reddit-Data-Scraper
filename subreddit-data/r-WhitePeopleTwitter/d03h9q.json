Altruism and kindness and caring means little in a large corporate environment, and small ones are incredibly hit or miss.",

Find one detail about them and ask about it until they tell you more and more about them.  Listen and learn and ask about small details.\n\n-Be genuinely excited about people.  That means learn to care about those around you.  Learn their hopes, dreams, and fears because you are actually wanting to care about them.\n\n-Be friends with people even if they have strong personalities\n\n-Talk WAY less and listen way more (some of the best connectors I know were the shy, nerdy kids in high school)\n\n-Smile and be excited about life\n\n-Do not be afraid to ask for favors.  Everyone loves flexing their insiderness.  Plus, if someone knows of a job at their company, they'd way rather have it go to someone they like than a stranger\n\n-Social Media (LinkedIn and Facebook are the big ones).  Don't be afraid on going on a fishing expedition to someone you haven't talked to in 10 years.  They haven't dropped you for a reason\n\n-Do favors when possible.  Know someone who is hiring and someone who'd be great for that position?  Make the effort to introduce.  Favors occasionally come around\n\n-Go to networking events.  They're fun and often have booze.\n\nThe world is way more about who you know than what you know.  Love it or hate it, we live in a society that requires relationships. When you grow a love for people, you will be able to harness those relationships.",

The fact is both sides have a point but are too busy blaming each other when it's really automation and corporate greed that are the culprits. Allow me to ramble quite a bit.\n\nWhen boomers say \"You just gotta show up on time, ready to work, and with a positive attitude\" they aren't stupid, it's just the world they lived in. When they grew up low skilled uneducated workers were in high demand because automation wasn't prevalent yet. Businesses needed actual bodies to get shit done and make money, which made being a reliable hard worker a highly desired trait. It didn't much matter if you graduated high school really, just that you were big enough and reliable enough to do the job. It wasn't rare for a kid to drop out of school at 17 because he had already secured himself a good manual labor factory job that he planned on keeping until retirement. \n\nThen automation appeared on the horizon and all the sudden manual labor and repetitive jobs were being outsourced to robots. This not only meant the owner didn't need as many employees so he made more money but also reduced the supply of low skilled uneducated jobs. Since the amount people applying for these jobs was still their, and the population continued to grow, the businesses put higher expectation on applicants by requiring high school degrees.\n\nFast forward to today and automation is rampant with low skilled uneducated jobs being bleak and dropping. In about 10 years automated long haul driving will likely displace 3 million or so truckers. Today you not only need a college degree but you're gonna want a 4 year degree in a related field from a \"good\" school. Since there is so little space available at these places they jack up the prices to crazy amounts for degrees that are devalued due to a flooded market leaving them working in some unrelated field with little prospects and a ton of debt.\n\nIt's a polar opposite world for people just to get a decent job let alone something they thought of as a career. Just an example of how rampant the automation is, just look at Uber. Now, Uber will be just fine I imagine...but those people who found this great new industry that allowed them to bolster their income are gonna be looking for another way once self driving Uber's become common. That industry was just birthed like a decade ago and it's already facing extinction.\n\nOnce again it was greedy assholes that fucked over every generation along the way through their greed. We were sold this grand idea about how automation was gonna be this amazing tool that would allow us all to just sit at our homes out in the back yard next to the pool with the sun shining as we BBQ burgers for our wife, 2 kids, and dog. Well we got the automation and people were no longer working but none of that ever trickled down to those people displaced by that automation.\n\nSorry for that wall of text, but I'm a Gen X guy who's kind of stuck in the middle in this tantrum and it's pretty tiring watching them bitch at eat each other for shit neither of them did. It's like high school and there's a third party instigating a fight between the two when they both should pissed at that third party.",

That's what all of this crap will eventually become for you: trends. As everyone's world opens up as you grow older, there comes a point where your world gets smaller again.

So, Texas does this, but then say Vermont decides they don't like the 2nd amendment. So, cool you can have guns. But they pass a law that says anyone in the state can sue you for having one. Or using it wrong. And multiple people can sue you. So, if anyone sees you with a gun holstered wrong can sue you. Nothing you can do about it. Or, free speech. Sure you can say whatever you want, and you can never be in jail for it, but here's a hot line to report the things you don't like and here's how to sue them for it. Have your friends sue too.  It's encouraged!  What kind of fucking world do these people want?",

If steve and larry got in a fistfight and one got hurt, they could sue each other all day long.  But Jack  wasn\u2019t involved, so he couldn\u2019t sue, even if it was a good case, because he wasn\u2019t a party to the dispute and, for lack of a better term, it\u2019s not his business.  \n\n&gt;And I don\u2019t know how this TX law can survive judicial review.  Pro or Anti Roe, if you open the doors to anyone suing for everything, I mean that\u2019s like knocking out one of the fundamental pillars of our whole system of law.  I could get bored and become a third party to any divorce if I wanted, as a stranger, and make them take depositions while I asked them intrusive sex questions.  I could try to do a private adoption and my asshole neighbor could intervene and get my private home study, including my income info and SSN.\n\n&gt;So I get that we\u2019ve got a dystopian SCOTUS.  But I don\u2019t get how this law survives.  That\u2019s my hot take without having researched deeply.\n\n*edited some names.",

It will probably be struck down by the lower courts, and if the SCOTUS takes up the case they will throw it out because this would open a rabbithole that they won't want to take the legal system down. Imagine CEQA lawsuits where instead of suing the state, they sue the applicant.",

It was run by Texas Right To Life, one of the bigger anti-choice advocacy groups in Texas.\n\nThe law is really weird and even some anti-choice advocates are disturbed by it.\n\nThe deal is that when states pass laws like this Planned Parenthood sues and asks a judge to put the law on hold until all the appeals are worked out, for good legal reasons this almost always happens and in the end (up until now with the Trump packed court) when it gets to the SCOTUS it gets struck down.\n\nTexas wanted to keep this from happening by trying to make it impossible for PP to sue to put a hold on the law.\n\nThe workaround they chose was to forbid the state of Texas, or any employees of the state of Texas, or any elected officials of the state of Texas, from enforcing the law. It's written right into it that the government cannot enforce it.\n\nInstead the law empowers anyone else \\[1\\] to bring a civil lawsuit against people who might have aided in a newly illegal abortion. If that person wins the civil lawsuit the law grants them a $10,000 bounty.\n\nIt's state endorsed and encouraged vigilantism. And that's one reason why even some anti-choicers don't like it, because that's really damn scary to anyone who thinks for very long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] And they defined \"anyone else\" really broadly. So broadly that it might include foreign citizens, or possibly even foreign corporate entities.",

Rafael, Mitch, Lindsey \u2013 all of them \u2013 unhinge their jaws and swallow children as old as two whole. The children must be alive. The blood, bones, flesh, etc. are icing but the cake is innocent human *souls*.\n\nThey don't worship Satan or anything. Satan is a comparative good guy in their company. These guys are the proper agents of chaos, madness, and absolute cold hinted at by Lovecraft and raving madmen.",

Between the Covid response and misinformation, regressively revoking women's rights, as well the capital and denying climate change. ITs never been more clear who these racist christian conservative dinosaurs are. Furthermore there is absolutely no reason to vote republican unless your obscenely rich, or really really really fucking stupid. As you're actively voting against your own interest, the only reason this party still exists is because they are so good at manipulating the uneducated of the country and are backed by old money. The younger generations need to vote instead of being outraged when these people do what the party is known for. Vote these people out and stop allowing Scrooge Mc Duck's party to do so much goddamn harm. Make these backwards ass idiots a thing of the past.",

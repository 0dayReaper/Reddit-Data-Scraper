So, ok, the Lemon Pound Cake cop was getting famous -- but there was no name associated with him in the video.  \n\nBut their lawsuit filing lists their names right at the top, and even prominently tells the public the name of Lemon Pound Cake cop.  I'm not sure if posting it here would violate any Reddit rules, but frankly it shouldn't because the guy **literally put out a legal document identifying himself**.",

Civil forfeiture allows police to seize \u2014 and then keep or sell \u2014 any property they allege is involved in a crime. Owners need not ever be arrested or convicted of a crime for their cash, cars, or even real estate to be taken away permanently by the government.\nForfeiture was originally presented as a way to cripple large-scale criminal enterprises by diverting their resources. But today, aided by deeply flawed federal and state laws, many police departments use forfeiture to benefit their bottom lines, making seizures motivated by profit rather than crime-fighting. For people whose property has been seized through civil asset forfeiture, legally regaining such property is notoriously difficult and expensive, with costs sometimes exceeding the value of the property.\u201d*\n\nTotally above board! /s",

A subsequent review by the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation determined that deputies had miscounted the amount seized during the raid itself.\n\nOh they just miscounted the first time. No money missing afterall /s. But they super dooper promise that they counted correctly during the review. It begs the question of why even bother doing inventory and giving a receipt if you can just contradict it later.\n\nSource: https://www.wlwt.com/article/afroman-rapper-sued-adams-county-deputies-who-raided-home/43402351",

He also started 45 minutes late because he had to smoke one more blunt, then one more blunt, okay now this is the last one, but let\u2019s smoke one more. But I digress, fuck Travis Scott.",

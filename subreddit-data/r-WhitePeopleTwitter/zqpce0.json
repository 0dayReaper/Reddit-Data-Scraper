The Prez can lean hard on Congress to suspend or reduce gas taxes, which Biden did earlier this year.  The other handle is direct: the Prez controls the strategic petroleum reserve, which can flood or dry up the market, but only on a short term basis.\n\nMy estimation is that a Prez can affect up to a maximum of about a dollar of current gas prices, but probably less than that.  And only for a few months.  So, if gas prices are $5 a gallon, the prez could maybe get them down to $4 for a while.  Then the market catches up and he's fucked and can't do any more than that.  \n\nThe rest has to come through diplomacy and loosening restrictions on domestic production, and trying to reduce demand by promoting alternatives: solar, wind, renewables, etc.",

Forget 4G, or whatever.\n\nImagine the person who knows you the best, who knows some approximation of your needs, wants, and inner desires. Now imagine someone who knows you even better than that, and wants to convince you to vote for Trump. That is basically Facebook and other sites in the era of third-party cookie tracking, Cambridge Analytica, before Big Tech stepped up and added a curtain of self-regulation.\n\nObviously knowing all that won't be enough to convince just anyone to do anything. But with enough ad frequency, backed by a large enough amount of data, it is remarkable how efficient it is to target those whose minds can be changed, and to know how to change them.\n\nThat is why TikTok is a national security issue, for example.",

Meanwhile us new hires who have been there for under 10 years would be lucky to take home a third of what those people were making. But then when they retire, those extra wages arent then suddenly available on the payroll to distribute to the rest of us via raises. Instead the companies do shit like stock buybacks and dividends. So that boomer who just retired, and probably has a lot of stocks in their retirement plans, is STILL getting that extra income instead of us younger workers.",

Leading to far more work for everyone and far less free time to recharge however any given person best recharges.\n\nObviously it\u2019s excellent that we, as a society writ large, has evolved past simply expecting men to work a job and expecting women to stay at home, it\u2019s just that the idea of the 40 hour work week is ~~arcane~~ *archaic* and hasn\u2019t evolved alongside that cultural change.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m a huge advocate of the 24 hour work week. It\u2019s not exactly a blanket solution, but if you consider office jobs, for example, it\u2019s an open secret that *nobody* is busy and productive for 40 hours a week. 24\u2019s also just evenly divisible by a lot of different numbers, offering a lot of flexibility for easy organizational scheduling options. Four six hour shifts, three eights, two twelves, one 24, whatever works in whatever industry and field. I\u2019d imagine four sixes would be one of the most common breakdowns. Imagine every weekend being a three day weekend *and* having an extra two hours on days you *do* work to either tend to your home or yourself.",

Many popular National Parks are surrounded by these other public lands and can be much easier to find available campsites. Some less visited parks operate their campgrounds on a first-come-first-serve basis, but many popular ones are switching to lottery systems. In any case, the key is to plan ahead--especially for popular areas--so you are ready to make reservations when they're released. That said, I have had decent luck checking for cancellations just before spontaneous trips.\n\nFor the more experienced and well-equipped, dispersed camping is free on BLM and some National Forest land too. Just make sure you pay attention to the rules (esp. regarding fires) and take safety seriously.\n\nNational Parks are mandated to be accessible by all Americans so they try not to raise prices, but they are being \"loved to death\" and so need to explore other options to manage crowds (permits, lottery systems, etc.).\n\nOne more thing: buy an [America the Beautiful Pass](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm) if you think you'll hit ~3 National Parks or other public lands in a calendar year. The pass covers entrance fees, standard amenity fees, day-use fees, and more for you *and those traveling in your vehicle.* And if you have a veteran in your family they can get a lifetime pass for **free**.\n\nOk, one more pro tip: if peace and quiet is important (and it should be in the outdoors), make sure to check out the campground map and try to select sites that are on the edges or tips of the campground. It should go without saying, but also try to avoid selecting sites near major roads, bathrooms, dumpsters, pump-out stations, etc. Recreation.gov even has pics of some sites to check out. Do this research before reservations open so you know which sites to target--you WILL have competition for the \"good\" ones.",

That's without meals and shit you know kids will want. That's insane! We took our two sons on a 3-week roadtrip through Spain and Portugal and we spent 6k, and that includes airfare, car rental, gas, airbnbs, and some of the best meals and wine in my life.",

To really analyze why the 50\u2019s-80\u2019s was the \u201cgolden age\u201d of the American Dream, you have to go back to the end of WWII. \n\nAfter the war, we had an employment rate of almost 99.7%. Basically, everyone was employed because munitions factories were pumping out so many weapons that they needed every man, woman and child regardless of race. So our manufacturing infrastructure was super advanced by war\u2019s end. \n\nNow, add in two other factors: we had also undergone the biggest transformation in worker rights EVER coming out of the Great Depression, coupled with Europe and SE Asia being ravaged by the war (ie bombs, land wars, invasions, etc). \n\nMen could come out of HS and have a high-paying job because we were the manufacturing capital of the world; there was no competition. So many didn\u2019t see the value in advanced education when no training or extra expertise was needed to land a high-paying job. \n\nThis, coupled with massive infrastructure upgrades during the Eisenhower administration really catapulted our economy forward. It was now easy to transport goods across the continental US and a lot of high-paying construction jobs were needed to achieve this. \n\nFast forward 30 years, and China had begun to transform into the manufacturing power house we know today, Europe was rebuilt, Japan had completely modernized and now, it was cheaper for corporations to outsource manufacturing jobs overseas. Basically, the end of the manufacturing state. \n\nAnd, since fewer and fewer goods were being transported inside the country, infrastructure and infrastructure jobs were not needed as much as before. \n\nThat meant that we had become a service-based economy, primarily. This happens to all nations once they\u2019re done developing. Now, the whole economy is based on providing services and buying goods rather than producing goods and exporting them. \n\nBecause of this, advanced education was needed to get higher paying jobs, and because of that the demand for degrees rose exponentially. This meant loan providers could jack up the costs to go to school but employers didn\u2019t have to raise wages because the supply of jobs was the same but they now had an increasing number of applicants \u201cfighting\u201d for the same jobs.\n\nYou throw all of that into a pot with Reagan cutting taxes on the wealthy and on corporations significantly, and what you get is added costs to an already over-burdened middle class (after all, *someone* has to pay the taxes that fund our country, and if not the poor or the wealthy, who does that leave?)\n\nSo, there was a perfect storm that created that golden age, as well another perfect storm that ended it.",

The highest rates of American poverty and violence in the last century happened during the late 70s to early 90s. \n\nThe white middle class was at its highest point in those days, but anyone who was not white or middle class was often incredibly poor and living in a world of drug addiction and gang violence. \n\nThe massive increase in anxiety, drug addiction, and gun violence happening now is a result of our nation simply *approaching* the level of rot that was commonplace in Reagan's era.\n\nIn 2018 LA's homicide rate was 6.4 per 100,000. In 1979 that rate was 23 per 100,000.  New York City's most violent year ever recorded was in 1990.\n\nThe poverty rate today is 12%. In 1960 it was 22%. \n\nThe \"boomer golden age\" only ever applied to a decent chunk of suburban white families. It was never an indication of how America was as a whole. And the descendants of those white boomers today who can't afford a home are still better off than a large majority of Americans. \n\nTimes are tough right now, of course they are. But we need to take off the rose tinted glasses and realize that this country was never a utopian heaven flowing with milk and honey. A majority of Americans have been dealt a shit hand and have been living in poverty for the past two centuries.",

I think people in this position can complain, because complaining is relative and communicative, but I think they need to always remember that they are in a ridiculously privileged position. Too many never consider the pedestal they are already standing on.",

When you have to go to medical clinics instead of having a family doctor or your personal practitioner you get inconsistent care and people do not track trends in your medical situation.\n\nI have two serious genetic illnesses and I did not find out I had them until I was 30-35 because of the lack of critical care I received for diagnosis.\n\nCurrently my migraine medication cost $100 a pill. So I split the pills in half so I can work. \n\nMy other medication that was $1,600 was only because it was an oral dissolving tablet and not a solid tablet which normally is $30 at the Walmart.\n\nI currently need to switch to a new medication that could drastically change my quality of life however it's new thusly it also cost $1,300 to $2,000 a month before insurance.\n\nNow here's the kicker both of these prescription companies have a year-long trial plan that brings the price down to 30-$50 a month but you have to have health insurance to be able to access that price because they bill health insurance the difference still at that point. \n\nSo simply the United States has no excuse for not being able to restructure the system because we have templates all around the world between Canada and the EU while Washington, Oregon, and California Olive developed socialized healthcare systems for low-income people.\n\nIt's been 9 years since I lived in Washington state and if I move back there right now I would immediately have health care insurance. I'm still technically covered in that state and I could go back there and flash my card and get free medical care. The problem is is I can't afford to live in Washington state and work in the suburban - urban areas where my degree is most desired and I have been offered positions.\n\nA house where I live now cost between $35k to 150k for or a deluxe model with acreage.\n\nIn Washington a crappy house in a bad neighborhood could run me $250,000 to $300,000. and in Washington there's 100 different versions of people like me with the same level of ambitiousness and education and amazing feat behind us we're pretty dime of dozen but out on the west coast.\n\nHere there's very few people that have a bachelor's degree, very very few people who have a masters, and very very few people who have had the experience of the world traveler that I have.\n\nI know I'm screwed. I make too little on unemployment to be able to afford the Americas HealthCare Marketplace and I make too much on unemployment to be able to be in my state's Medicaid program.  so my only choice is to go back to the man and get a regular job with benefits and work the nine to five. It's stressful and honestly that kind of work makes me sicker but if that means I won't have my teeth rotting out of my face and my body rotting out before me I'll do it.",

There wasn't even an option to meet via online zoom or something.       \nThe funny thing is, they had the audacity to say, and I quote word for word, \"We gave you a new prescription this time but next time **don't call for this**'. I asked how many refills and they said 3 and also repeated again 'don't call for new prescriptions'.    \nMost places go through patients like a chicken slaughter house.

I've been uninsured for years and it's been the best option. You pay for the first consultation, $15, and enter your medical info. You can request your current birth control brand or try a new one. Then once approved they send you 3 months prescription at a time in the mail, mine is $45 (15 each pack) and renews every 3 months. I've been using Nurx for almost 4 years and had zero issues. I've always gotten my meds on time, never had a pregnancy scare and they respond quickly to any concerns. They even accept insurance. The downside is you don't get the peace of mind of OBGYN visits where they screen for cancer. If you can afford it, it's a good temporary or ongoing solution.",

On the website, they just asked for my insurance card and my credit card. I was taking Yasmin and it was ~$28 a month, if I remember correctly. I had the option to choose whatever kind of birth control I wanted; I chose the Yasmin over others so I could rid myself of acne and possibly grow some curves :) it was working, but I didn't want to experience (or die from) a blood clot.\n\nIt also worked out with my mother not knowing I was on BC. I always had it shipped to the UPS store nearby my workplace. Hope that helps anyone young and in need of these things like I was!",

Roosevelt during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, January 11, 1944. In his address, Roosevelt suggested that the nation had come to recognise and should now implement, a second \"bill of rights\". Roosevelt argued that the \"political rights\" guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights had \"proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness\". His remedy was to declare an \"economic bill of rights\" to guarantee these specific rights:\n\n&gt;\tEmployment (right to work), food, clothing and leisure with enough income to support them\n\n&gt;\tFarmers' rights to a fair income\n\n&gt;\tFreedom from unfair competition and monopolies\n\n&gt;\tHousing\n\n&gt;\tMedical care\n\n&gt;\tSocial security\n\n&gt;\tEducation\n\nAbove from the Wikipedia on the Second Bill of Rights (I tried posting with sources but comment was getting auto-removed)\n\nBernie ran explicitly on continuing this aspect of FDR\u2019s legacy and bringing the US a 21st Century Bill of Rights, while acknowledging the racial disparities in the original New Deal that he and people like AOC and Markey sought to remedy explicitly in the Green New Deal. That led us to having Chris Matthews on MSNBC comparing Bernie\u2019s primary wins to watching the Nazis invade France: \n\n&gt;\tBut as President Franklin Roosevelt said 75 years ago: \u201cTrue individual freedom cannot exist without economic security.\u201d That is why our campaign is calling for a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that guarantees all of our people the right to the basic necessities of life \u2014 and guarantees those rights regardless of Americans\u2019 income, race, religion, gender, country of origin or sexual orientation.\n\n&gt;\tThe 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights establishes that all Americans are entitled to:\n\n&gt;\tThe right to a job that pays a living wage\n\n&gt;\tThe right to quality health care\n\n&gt;\tThe right to a complete education\n\n&gt;\tThe right to affordable housing\n\n&gt;\tThe right to a clean environment\n\n&gt;\tThe right to a secure retirement\n\n&gt;\tThere is no freedom without economic freedom.\n\nThe above from Bernie\u2019s website on his 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights.\n\nUp until the 1920s healthcare was much less developed than it would become with the innovations of medicines like penicillin. The 20s-40s bringing broader, more expensive treatment possibilities.\n\nThere was still, in the 1900s-1910s, an initial push for state provided healthcare. The American Association for Labor Legislation (AALL) began organizing in 1905, and became a major group pushing for state healthcare. By the 1910s Theodore Roosevelt was including a form of healthcare as one of his platform planks for the Progressive Party.\n\nThe mid 1910s saw the introduction of bills that provided some form national healthcare to congress and many bills introduced at state level, with AALL, labor, socialists, industry workers, etc backing them. (Though worth noting socialists backing something *does not* make a policy socialist, since the US would have still remained deeply capitalist even with national health insurance)\n\nEven the American Medical Association provided some support at first, though they would turn on the idea *aggressively* in the next few years and would be a key player in undermining US universal healthcare for decades after. Along with the AMA in providing opposition were various corporate groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers and US Chamber of Commerce. All these groups still providing opposition today.\n\nBy the 1920s, the playing field had shattered. Interest groups were against the idea, and US labor had gone through a fracturing period. Certain portions of labor opposed entry to WWI while others backed entry, then after the war and Russian Revolution the initial Red Scare was being used to cut at labor and American Socialist organizations (even bringing sedition charges against many, which is why Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs was arrested and made his 1920 run for President from prison, receiving 3.5% of the vote, down from his 6% vote share in 1912).\n\nWhen FDR came about he was looking at including healthcare in the Social Security Act of 1935, but decided to drop healthcare in order to increase the chance of Social Security passing.\n\nBy 1943, labor was moving towards picking up the fight for universal healthcare, since unions were spending a lot of effort and bargaining power on healthcare benefits. Meanwhile, certain members of Congress were coming together to put a bill forth for universal healthcare, which became the Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill.\n\nIn 1944, FDR included in his economic bill of rights the goal to bring the US universal healthcare, and the Social Security Board called for national health insurance as part of Social Security. However, FDR died before he could fight that fight. \n\nThis led Truman to pick up the mantle and make it his goal to get universal healthcare for the US. This led to *massive* backlash from private insurers and doctors, who led a tremendous media blitz painting government healthcare as \u201csocialist\u201d. The American Medical Association waged the most expensive lobbying effort in US history up to that point against it. (The NPR podcast Throughline has a great episode titled The Everlasting Problem on the history of US healthcare)\n\nTruman\u2019s fight for universal healthcare is why, when LBJ signed Medicare into law in 1965, Truman was given Medicare card #1. During the same decade, another Medicare was taking off: Canadian Medicare. [The same propaganda and assaults from interest groups and doctors that happened in the US happened in Canada - however in Canada universal healthcare won out](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/the-birth-of-medicare). As a result, Canada now has universal healthcare and the man who is often considered the forebearer of Canadian universal healthcare - Tommy Douglas - was voted the greatest Canadian of all time in the Canada wide CBC poll.\n\nNow, 50+ years after Medicare, progressives face the same \u201csocialist\u201d propaganda Truman and LBJ faced when seeking healthcare coverage in America. The same political and industry propaganda faced by Tommy Douglas and the Medicare movement in Canada.\n\nThis absurd propaganda has led millions of Americans over the last decades to die early due to lack of health insurance or poor healthcare coverage. [An estimated 50,000 Americans die *every year* due to lack of health insurance.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/)\n\n&gt;\tNearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with lack of health insurance, according to a new study published online today by the American Journal of Public Health. That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2002.\nThe study, conducted at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, found that uninsured, working-age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts, up from a 25 percent excess death rate found in 1993.\n\nThe recent Lancet study estimates the yearly deaths at 68,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the new, only months old [Congressional Budget Office analysis of healthcare proposals found that Universal Healthcare/Medicare for All would save the US hundreds of billions of dollars every year.](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2020/12/11/cbo-medicare-for-all-reduces-health-spending/)\n\n3,000 people died in 9/11, while 16x that die every year due to lack of healthcare coverage in the US. Imagine if the media treated it the same - regularly showing clips of people dying in their home as they can\u2019t afford $300 insulin, stories of the many who notice a lump but decide to ignore it because they cannot afford to get it checked out, not feel good stories about GoFundMe funds raised but the actual horror of GoFundMe being needed, the daily bankruptcy proceedings that go on due to medical debt (#1 cause of bankruptcy in America).",

The American Medical Association began to lobby against the president's proposal. In 1949, they retained Whitaker &amp; Baxter to help them with their efforts. The AMA paid Whitaker &amp; Baxter $350,000 to defeat Truman's healthcare plan.[1] In their usual style, Whitaker &amp; Baxter began an all out media war against the healthcare plan, distributing over 100 million pieces of literature. In just two weeks of the campaign, Whitaker &amp; Baxter was given a $100,000 retainer and over $1 million to spend on advertising, which is a $956,000 retainer and $9.5 million budget[9] in today's dollars. They spent $1.1 million in advertising on behalf of the AMA. As part of their messaging, they began calling the president's healthcare plan \"socialized medicine,\"[1] ushering in the same negative connotations and allusions to communism that they had brought upon Sinclair.\n\n&gt;\tPresident Truman was quick to defend his plan. The plan included federal funding to attract doctors to rural areas, give funding to rural areas to build new hospitals, federal standards for hospitals and health centers to be implemented by a board of doctors and public officials, and the creation of a national health insurance fund to be managed by the federal government.[1] Unfortunately for Truman, the term \"socialized medicine\" stuck. In 1961, Ronald Reagan would continue using the phrase in his LP Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine, released on behalf of the AMA. The term would fuel the so-called Operation Coffee Cup of the 1960s, in which doctors' wives would invite friends over and speak to them about the evils of \"socialized medicine,\" after which they would encourage them to write to their congressmen about the issue.\n\n&gt;\tUltimately, it would take the American Medical Association over 3 years and $5 million, which would equate to nearly $40 million by today's standards. After the onset of the Korean War, Congress and the president no longer had time to fight lobbying efforts against the measure, resulting in the legislation failing to pass.\n\nMuch to Truman\u2019s dismay, the term \u201csocialized medicine\u201d has stuck around much longer than public knowledge of his efforts towards a national healthcare.",

It's not a question of universal healthcare, it's a problem of regulations. \nHospitals and doctors make you pay amounts of money which have nothing to do with what they did or what it cost them. \n     \nIn France, doctors are divided in different groups. A \"secteur 1\" doctor can't make you pay more than 25\u20ac and your healthcare will reimburse you totally. A \"secteur 2\" doctor can make you pay more. Universal Healthcare will take care of 25\u20ac and your private healthcare can pay the rest. It's your choice to go see them because they can give you an appointment sooner or because he's a known specialist. But you always have the possibility to see a doctor for \"free\" Whichever disease you have. \n      \nIt's the same for drugs. Important drugs prescribed by your doctor (antibiotics, painkillers, chemotherapy, tension regulators, etc...) or imagery (IRM, scanner, echography...) are fully reimbursed by your universal healthcare. Other drugs can be only partially reimbursed because they are considered less important, but the price off all of them is regulated. \n      \nIt's the same for when you have to go to the hospital. They can't make you pay thousands of dollars for no reason. All of it is regulated. You can go in a private clinic for more comfort but you'll have to pay the difference (or your private health insurance will pay the difference). But you'll always be able to be taken care of without paying anything.",

The profit margins are through the roof. There needs to be a cap on \"administrative costs\" because 35% is ridiculous. In France, this is capped at 5.5%. the hospitals just have to deal with it. \n\nThese \"healthcare\" corporations are closing hospitals in rural areas that aren't profitable enough, resulting in much lower health outcomes for these communities.",

Considering they're both democratic countries that are capitalistic. And he said the difference in that case is the US is not capitalistic, but rather, *hyper-capitalistic.* That's always stuck with me.",

He handed them directly to me while I waited. AND I doubt I spent 5 minutes in the waiting room.\n\nHe smiled, was friendly, and was standing there while the desk lady handed me the bill. When she noticed my shock, she asked, \"Is this too much? Do you need a little help?\", I replied, \"No. You could add a zero to that total and it would still be cheap in the US.\"\n\nI noticed a sad, little far-off stare in the doc's eyes when I said that. Not sure if it was sadness that one of his fellow healthcare professionals could place profit over the Hippocratic Oath, or if he was thinking about moving to the US.",

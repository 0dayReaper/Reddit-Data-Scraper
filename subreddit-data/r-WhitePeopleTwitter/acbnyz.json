A journal full of vague notes about The Organization, a riddle-couplet on our tombstone, etc. I got way more into it than he did, and actually did research on natural features that I could use to guide these fictional family members to the treasure at the end of the hunt. Which was like, a bottle of liquor of some kind. My friend said he wanted it to be something weirder, so I suggested magnetic putty around a metal ball. Looks like an oozing sentient goo-alien in a jar.",

They slowly approach the steps leading to the basement and descend into the dark, the light dead long ago but never repaired. \n\nThey slowly push the door ajar. \n\nTheir son, hands caked in Cheeto dust and stomach flaps obscuring the keyboard in his lap, pours out another discomforting gurgle. His pimpled face a blue shade, an effect of the five desktop monitors lighting up the otherwise darkened room. \n\n\u201cIs he... is he laughing?\u201d Asks the woman, a mixture of shock and revulsion evident from her confused tone. \n\n\u201cNo... that\u2019s not possible... he\u2019s never laughed, before.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon, are you okay?\u201d The apparent woman questions the form, \u201cAre you... happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeh. Some guy on Reddit made a joke about being lonely. What a loser.\u201d\n\n(Just a funny thought when you said this was the first time you\u2019ve ever laughed. Didn\u2019t notice you clarified \u2018today\u2019 until I\u2019d put in too much effort to just stop. No offense is meant, and you aren\u2019t the fictitious person I\u2019m describing.)",

He was my grandma\u2019s only brother and he never married or had kids, so we were his family\u2014our holiday plans would usually revolve around him.  He told us stories about having to hitchhike and pranks he\u2019d played as a kid.  He was a goofy old uncle who would tell us video games melted our brains and we loved him.\n\nWhen he died (I was maybe 12) it seemed like the entire US Military came.  There were at least a dozen dozen Marines in full uniform at his funeral.  They had the white gloves on and everything.  They stood at attention while my cousins and uncle and I served as pall bearers.  There were a lot of older guys in VFW clothing or vests.  There were a couple who had put on a uniform even though they were clearly too old to be active service members.  They played taps.  There was someone of pretty high rank\u2014a major or a colonel, I don\u2019t remember, but he ordered a gun salute and they presented a flag to one of my aunts.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know it (I didn\u2019t, my cousins didn\u2019t, maybe some members of the family knew) but my great uncle was a bona fide war hero.  He\u2019d won a Silver Star and a Distinguished Service Medal.  He was nominated for a Navy Cross (not sure if posthumously or not).  Most of us had no idea.  \n\nEveryone was like \u201choly shot, Great Uncle was a fucking war hero.\u201d  One of the older soldiers read something during the service and it told about how my uncle had helped retrieve wounded countrymen without orders under heavy enemy fire and then held his post as they were evacuated even though he was overrun.  He\u2019d been a POW.  He was a LEGIT war hero and none of us knew.\n\nFinding that out at his funeral was a genuinely awesome thing.  No one was really sad.  Everyone was just awed by the man and the respect he\u2019d been shown.  So there\u2019s something to be said for funeral surprises.",

One has to look like an old man in a black suit and a cane and the two are his bodyguards (with matching clothing of course). This has to be implied visually as they will not speak the whole time. \n\nThey arrive at the funeral home in an old-timey black limo, with the old man heading straight to my coffin, limping but with a dignified air. The two guys remain stoically behind him at the same pace. Once the old man arrives at my casket, he looks at my body briefly, says \"it is done\" in Latin, and lays a single ancient Roman coin on the lid. The three then turn and leave, never interacting with anyone the entire time. \n\nI think this prank works best for people who are famous or have significant influence, because even if they prove it's a joke many will still think it's a conspiracy.

Daddy was informed that the family had scheduled a wake at an area funeral parlor, so of course he wanted to pay his respects.  He put on his suit and drove to the parlor at the appropriate time.\n\nThere was only one wake going on, so Daddy went to the room he was directed to by the staff.  He didn\u2019t recognize a single person there, but since he wasn\u2019t particularly close to this coworker that didn\u2019t surprise him. What surprised Daddy was that when he walked up to the casket, the deceased was a little old white lady. \n\nHere\u2019s the part that makes this especially memorable: our family is black. I\u2019m black, my siblings are black, my mother was black, and of course my father was black.  And if I may be so bold, my father (RIP) was a very handsome man.\n\nI should also probably add that Daddy was the only black person at the wake.  And please note that this occurred in the early 70s in a small town in the American South.  His presence was noticed.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, my father bowed his head for a moment, then went to the guestbook to pretend to sign a name.  An elderly woman\u2014who, based on her resemblance to the deceased, may have been the little old lady\u2019s daughter\u2014approached Daddy and said \u201cDid you know Mother?\u201c\n\n\u201cWell, not very well,\u201d Daddy stammered.\n\nFortunately for his sake, the woman was then distracted by someone else, and Daddy was able to get out of there quickly.\n\nMy family has always wondered what sort of questions those people at the funeral had\u2014and maybe still have\u2014 about the handsome, nameless black man that showed up for their grandmother\u2019s wake and then disappeared without a trace shortly afterward. \n\n",

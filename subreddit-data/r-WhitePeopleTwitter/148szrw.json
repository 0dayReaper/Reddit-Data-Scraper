That -- for them -- would be an existential crisis.  I think they see transwomen as \"false advertising,\" a snare to entice them into having sex with someone who can't get pregnant and propagate their precious DNA.  And that just riles them up tremendously because their whole purpose in life is to propagate that DNA.  They may speak English but they think like silverbacks.  That's my take anyway, ymmv.",

Similar to how Southern states tend to have the highest amounts of interracial porn searches. The more they forbid it the more exciting the idea becomes, but they have to repress it because it's not socially acceptable there. Repressed feelings have a way of surfacing in other ways.\n\nWeirdly, I look at this map and can't help but think there are a lot of people who are secretly maybe even subconsciously willing to accept transgender people. Like it gives me a little hope. It just happens that a peculiar set of social norms has caused them to stuff their support deep inside (lol) or fear the social consequences.",

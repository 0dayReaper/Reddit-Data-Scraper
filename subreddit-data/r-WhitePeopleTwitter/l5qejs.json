This has a very small impact on mass incarceration. That said, it's a fundamental shift in the cultural embrace of private prisons that could impact some more progressive/liberal states' practices, which is great.\n\nEdit to add that federally, state, and locally-run facilities are also notoriously bad. Even if we ended all private prisons, we'd still have a long ways to go to end mass incarceration and inhumane practices in prison and jails.\n\nSecond edit to add that states control state-run prisons so Biden cannot end / change how they incarcerate except w/r/t certain forms of funding to incentivize certain changes",

In fact, most major court cases and legislation at the federal level are built upon local analogs.\n\nFor instance, California became the first state in the modern era to overturn it's anti-miscegenation laws in 1948. The Nevada courts followed soon after. The federal courts didn't follow suit until 1967.  In 2008, the California Supreme Court overturned proposition 22 on the grounds that same-sex marriage bans violated the equal protection clauses of the state Constitution. It wasn't until 2015 that the US Supreme Court followed suit. California passed the Unruh Civil Rights Act in the 50s, which outlawed discrimination in public accommodation and housing, a decade before federal legislation. New York, New Jersey, and many other states outlawed slavery before the 13th amendment was passed.",

As a prosecutor that meant she went after these laws *hard* and worked to prosecute, in an unjust criminal justice system.\n\n&gt; With the growing recognition that prosecutors hold the keys to a fairer criminal justice system, the term \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d has almost become trendy. This is how Senator Kamala Harris of California, a likely presidential candidate and a former prosecutor, describes herself.\n\n&gt; But she\u2019s not.\n\n&gt; Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state\u2019s attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent. Most troubling, Ms. Harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.\n\n&gt; Consider her record as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of \u201cintentionally sabotaging\u201d her work and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced showing that Ms. Harris\u2019s deputies knew about the technician\u2019s wrongdoing and recent conviction, but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge condemned Ms. Harris\u2019s indifference to the systemic violation of the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\n&gt; Ms. Harris contested the ruling by arguing that the judge, whose husband was a defense attorney and had spoken publicly about the importance of disclosing evidence, had a conflict of interest. Ms. Harris lost. More than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed.\n\n&gt; Ms. Harris also championed state legislation under which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school could be prosecuted, despite concerns that it would disproportionately affect low-income people of color.\n\n&gt; Ms. Harris was similarly regressive as the state\u2019s attorney general. When a federal judge in Orange County ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional in 2014, Ms. Harris appealed. In a public statement, she made the bizarre argument that the decision \u201cundermines important protections that our courts provide to defendants.\u201d (The approximately 740 men and women awaiting execution in California might disagree).\n\n&gt; In 2014, she declined to take a position on Proposition 47, a ballot initiative approved by voters, that reduced certain low-level felonies to misdemeanors. She laughed that year when a reporter asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Ms. Harris finally reversed course in 2018, long after public opinion had shifted on the topic.\n\n&gt; In 2015, she opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings involving officers. And she refused to support statewide standards regulating the use of body-worn cameras by police officers. For this, she incurred criticism from an array of left-leaning reformers, including Democratic state senators, the A.C.L.U. and San Francisco\u2019s elected public defender. The activist Phelicia Jones, who had supported Ms. Harris for years, asked, \u201cHow many more people need to die before she steps in?\u201d\n\n&gt; Worst of all, though, is Ms. Harris\u2019s record in wrongful conviction cases. Consider George Gage, an electrician with no criminal record who was charged in 1999 with sexually abusing his stepdaughter, who reported the allegations years later. The case largely hinged on the stepdaughter\u2019s testimony and Mr. Gage was convicted.\n\n&gt; Afterward, the judge discovered that the prosecutor had unlawfully held back potentially exculpatory evidence, including medical reports indicating that the stepdaughter had been repeatedly untruthful with law enforcement. Her mother even described her as \u201ca pathological liar\u201d who \u201clives her lies.\u201d\n\n&gt; That case is not an outlier. Ms. Harris also fought to keep Daniel Larsen in prison on a 28-year-to-life sentence for possession of a concealed weapon even though his trial lawyer was incompetent and there was compelling evidence of his innocence.  Relying on a technicality again, Ms. Harris argued that Mr. Larsen failed to raise his legal arguments in a timely fashion. (This time, she lost.)\n\n&gt; She also defended Johnny Baca\u2019s conviction for murder even though judges found a prosecutor presented false testimony at the trial. She relented only after a video of the oral argument received national attention and embarrassed her office.\n\n&gt; And then there\u2019s Kevin Cooper, the death row inmate whose trial was infected by racism and corruption. He sought advanced DNA testing to prove his innocence, but Ms. Harris opposed it. (After The New York Times\u2019s expos\u00e9 of the case went viral, she reversed her position.)\n\n&gt; All this is a shame because the state\u2019s top prosecutor has the power and the imperative to seek justice. In cases of tainted convictions, that means conceding error and overturning them. Rather than fulfilling that obligation, Ms. Harris turned legal technicalities into weapons so she could cement injustices.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html\n\nhttps://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/kamala-harris-trump-obama-california-attorney-general\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/24/kamala-harris-2020-history-224126",

[The creation of, and continued use of, slavery by another name is a societal indictment that warrants major systemic remedy (this PBS doc is a great look at the creation of this system after the Civil War).](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UcCxsLDma2o)\n\nPrivate prisons deserve quite a lot of attention, however they are part of a larger prison structure that exploits prisons for profit.\n\nWhile private prisons themselves are a major problem, and bring in billions a year, there is more money being made by private businesses that supply non-private prisons as well as private businesses that utilize prison labor: \n\n&gt;\t**The private-prison industry\u2019s annual revenues total $4 billion. By comparison, the correctional food-service industry alone provides the equivalent of $4 billion worth of food each year, according to Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. Corrections departments spend at least $12.3 billion on health care, about half of which is provided by private companies. Telephone companies, which can charge up to $25 for a 15-minute call, rake in $1.3 billion annually. The range of for-profit services is extensive, from transport vans to halfway houses, from video visitations to e-mail, from ankle monitors to care packages. To many companies, the roughly $80 billion that the United States spends on corrections each year is not a national embarrassment but a gold mine.**\n\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/archive/prison-privatization-private-equity-hig/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex\n\nMass incarceration pays big.\n\n**The US has 5% of the population, but 25% of the world\u2019s prisoners. The highest per capita prisoner rate in the world. 2+ million currently incarcerated. Around 1 in every 110 adults in the US is currently in prison.**\n\nThe system is set up to incarcerate, which has major ramifications for even those that get out (such as 10+% of Florida\u2019s electorate being felony disenfranchised (nonviolent drug possession can be a felony) in 2016, over 6 million disenfranchised across the states).\n\n**There has been a 500% increase in the prison population over the last 40 years, while US general pop has risen ~40%.** All evidence shows that the bulk of this change is not due to any change in crime, but to changes in law.\n\n&gt;\tSince the official beginning of the War on Drugs in the 1980s, the number of people incarcerated for drug offenses in the U.S. skyrocketed from 40,900 in 1980 to 452,964 in 2017. Today, there are more people behind bars for a drug offense than the number of people who were in prison or jail for any crime in 1980. The number of people sentenced to prison for property and violent crimes has also increased even during periods when crime rates have declined.\n\nhttps://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/\n\nAcross the country, an estimated 25% of those killed by police have mental illness. People with untreated mental illness are 16x more likely to be killed by law enforcement.\n\n**Meanwhile, there are 10x more people with mental illness in prisons in the US than in hospitals.** Using cops, and criminalizing mental illness, is detrimental to the individual and the country as a whole.\n\nSystems wherein health workers respond first to certain types of calls are already in place in parts of the US, such as CAHOOTS in Eugene Oregon, which answered 17% of Eugene\u2019s police department call volume in 2017 alone:\n\n&gt;\t31 years ago the City of Eugene, Oregon developed an innovative community-based public safety system to provide mental health first response for crises involving mental illness, homelessness, and addiction. White Bird Clinic launched CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) as a community policing initiative in 1989.\n\n&gt;\tThe CAHOOTS model has been in the spotlight recently as our nation struggles to reimagine public safety. The program mobilizes two-person teams consisting of a medic (a nurse, paramedic, or EMT) and a crisis worker who has substantial training and experience in the mental health field. The CAHOOTS teams deal with a wide range of mental health-related crises, including conflict resolution, welfare checks, substance abuse, suicide threats, and more, relying on trauma-informed de-escalation and harm reduction techniques. CAHOOTS staff are not law enforcement officers and do not carry weapons; their training and experience are the tools they use to ensure a non-violent resolution of crisis situations. They also handle non-emergent medical issues, avoiding costly ambulance transport and emergency room treatment.\n\n&gt;\tA November 2016 study published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine estimated that 20% to 50% of fatal encounters with law enforcement involved an individual with a mental illness. The CAHOOTS model demonstrates that these fatal encounters are not inevitable. Last year, out of a total of roughly 24,000 CAHOOTS calls, police backup was requested only 150 times.\n\n&gt;\tThe cost savings are considerable. The CAHOOTS program budget is about $2.1 million annually, while the combined annual budgets for the Eugene and Springfield police departments are $90 million. In 2017, the CAHOOTS teams answered 17% of the Eugene Police Department\u2019s overall call volume. The program saves the city of Eugene an estimated $8.5 million in public safety spending annually.\n\nhttps://whitebirdclinic.org/what-is-cahoots/\n\nOnly 0.6% of CAHOOTS 24000 calls last year even required backup. These are calls that usually go straight to the police in many places.\n\nThese programs save substantial amounts of money, and are far more helpful for the people interacted with.\n\nMovements like \u201cdefund the police\u201d would still have cops, though the system would change drastically. More accountability, end of qualified immunity, likely many cop layoffs and them having to reapply for their jobs, etc. However, it would also cut back on cops and reduce their role in society, while funding programs to help us actually deal with root causes of crime, mass incarceration, and militarized policing. These programs can often save money, like seen above.\n\n&gt;\tWhat share of policing is devoted to handling violent crime? Perhaps not as much as you might think. A handful of cities post data online showing how their police departments spend their time. The share devoted to handling violent crime is very small, about 4 percent.\n\n&gt;\tThat could be relevant to the new conversations about the role of law enforcement that have arisen since the death of George Floyd in police custody and the nationwide protests that followed. For instance, there has been talk of \u201cunbundling\u201d the police \u2014 redirecting some of their duties, as well as some of their funding, by hiring more of other kinds of workers to help with the homeless or the mentally ill, drug overdoses, minor traffic problems and similar disturbances.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-police-time-violent-crime.html\n\nThere are *many* encounters where cops do not have the proper training to handle them, and are far more militarized than the situation calls for. You see police departments say \u201cprotesters are wearing gas masks\u201d as evidence of escalatory behavior - well same goes for when a cop pulls you over with a bulletproof vest on and their hand on their gun holster.\n\nThis goes further, including additional funding to things that have been shown to prevent future crime: employment opportunities, poverty reduction, improved education structures, health, etc.\n\nThis is really just an intro to some of these issues, and they go far deeper. The police force militarization we see now has not always been the standard, and has significantly increased in recent decades.\n\nFor further reading, I would suggest these as intros:\n\n*The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander (the makings of modern post-1960s mass incarceration, including the profound racial inequalities)\n\n*Slavery By Another Name: The Re-enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II* by Douglas Blackmon (Pulitzer winning book on convict leasing and new slavery after emancipation)\n\n*The End of Policing* by Alex Vitale (explores how defunding police might work, the alternatives, and includes a lot of research and analysis, such as why many of these \u201creforms\u201d like racial bias testing and body cams don\u2019t actually do much)\n\n*Are Prisons Obselete?* by Angela Davis (classic short text on prison abolition, history of the prison, what the alternatives to prison could be such as new mental and educational facilities, and many other issues)\n\n*Rise of the Warrior Cop* by Radley Balko (examines how in the last decades the cop has become so deeply militarized, examines some of these massive militarized budgets we see)\n\n*The Divide* by Matt Tiabbi (explores the impact of income inequality in the justice system, and how the system is harsher to the lower classes and criminalizes poverty)\n\nhttps://catalyst-journal.com/vol3/no3/the-economic-origins-of-mass-incarceration\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/george-floyd-protests-race.html\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/how-i-became-police-abolitionist/613540/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html (this article looks at Norway\u2019s Halden Prison, and how different the focus on rehabilitation is there whereas the US focuses on punishment)\n\nAs well as documentaries such as *13th* and *The House I Live In*.",

Also, it further distortes and confuses the issue of the prison industrial complex to make it seem like \"profiteering from prisons\" == \"private prisons\" which is absolutely not the case. It's a publicity stunt designed to make people feel good while ultimately serving to perpetuate the system of effectively slave labor from which so many corporations profit.",

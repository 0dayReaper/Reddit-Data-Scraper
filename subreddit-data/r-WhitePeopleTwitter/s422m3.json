We took them over, expecting quite a few kids there from what we'd been told... and our boys and the kid's older brothers were the only ones there.\n\nWhen the birthday boy really sadly asked if maybe they could do a sleepover instead of just the party, the ten year old gave me the most profoundly empathetic face I'd ever seen on him. I was already going to say yes, but that was the moment I knew we were making a real impact on these boys.\n\nBirthday boy still gives us gigantic hugs every time he sees us. It doesn't always take moving mountains to make a difference.",

It\u2019s truly an awful feeling. My though is, is if you\u2019re inviting MOST of the class, including acquaintances, then you should invite everyone so as not to leave anyone out. But on the other hand, if you\u2019re only inviting a few close friends, lots of people aren\u2019t invited and you aren\u2019t the only one left out- I think this realistic idea of levels of close friends is totally something kids should be taught growing up. Also, just don\u2019t be an asshole. That\u2019s the main thing. Parents of kids need to realize that those kinds of decisions can have real life and long term emotional consequences on ostracized and bullied kids. Love what the above parents did. Gives me hope \ud83d\udc96",

They had this whole day planned at the bowling alley with pizza and stuff. Both our parents just said \"fuck it, it's just two kids, let's just take them wherever the hell they want.\"\n\nWe skipped the pizza party and stuff, went to the toy store and bought some stuff, played video games, did go-carts, hung out with our parents and went to the movies. It was actually a blast, went way longer than the party was originally going to go, and the kid's parents made damn sure their kid showed up on the rare few times there was anything going on for me.\n\nBut it gave me a huge complex. I was like 9 or something, and I NEVER wanted to be in that kid's shoes. No more big birthday parties, none of that 16/18 big party stuff, didn't even do anything for my highschool or college graduation except have a beer with my dad when it was all said and done.\n\nI dunno. These days I prefer smaller affairs if anything and the thought of trying to schedule a big get-together isn't even on the table, but I'm not sure how much of that is being terrified of being the kid sitting in an empty room because nobody showed up for the birthday party. I'll go to a party I'm invited to and have a good time, but I'll be damned if I ever try and host one.",

I met my dentist through BJJ, a couple of people I golf with now, snowboard with, and when my wife broke her foot a few years ago, we get to the ER and the freaking ER doctor was someone I trained with haha he got us through asap and sped the whole thing along much faster.

You're not a bad person, clearly, since you care about your friends and you are able to admit to mistakes you've made.\nI've had a bandmate commit suicide a week or so after he came over to my place to rehearse and laugh at stupid YT videos. Everyone goes through the same motions after losing a friend  - why didn't I prevent this, I could've done more, I've dealt with the same and still couldn't help. Yet in fact, how were you supposed to know what to do? You're not omnipotent. Even though you are his friend, it was his decision. If he decided on continuing his usage after your meeting there was probably no way you could've changed his mind, if he decided to take the overdose impulsively, even moreso.\n\nYou're not a bad person, you had your own problems too, even though that might sound selfish, it simply deprives you of a healthy enough perspective to help. Do your best to survive and keep loved ones around you happy, this is my way out of such grief. You will never forget, but you can look at his death in a way that doesn't elicit sorrow, which you'll learn in time. Wish you all the best, take care.",

I went home humiliated and crying. \n\nA month later was my birthday and in retaliation I did the same - invited everyone but her. She freaked out and begged - BEGGED me ALL day to PLEEEASE invite her to my party. That night at dinner I smugly told my parents how I had given the brat a taste of her own medicine and how upset she was. My mother then informed me that I WOULD be inviting her and I was not to argue it. I was angry that I had to do that. I am still annoyed with that and it\u2019s been 30 years - the kid was a major turd to me all the time, but after she came to my party she was nicer after that. \n\nI realize now that my mom is the good guy in all of this and that kid had shitty parents, and that\u2019s why she was a shitty person in general.",

She hated me more after that.\n\nIt's weird to be hated and bullied by your grade and the grade above you, , while the school (partially at least) and your parents claims there isn't any bullying going on and that you are over exaggerating the whole thing just to create drama. Yes my beanie and my jacket just magically disappeared, just to reappear outside in the rain, pure luck that I had my cellphone in my backpack and not in the jacket that day. It was just a reoccurring coincidence when people said \"ewww\" every time I walked past them. \n\nThe people who were awful has a good career and families etc while I struggle to get through the day, it's not their fault, and other stuff was also going on so I know that they are not responsible for anything . but where the fuck is the karma? \n\nI am sorry for venting but your comment unlocked a suppressed memory. And I can't sleep so here we are\n\nEdited to add : even though my classmates in my grade made my life a living hell, they also came to my birthday parties, they invited me to theirs. Its so illogical, they could hide stuff in my backpack and throw stuff at me and later that week they invited me to their party, we were only 10-11 students in my class from 1st to 8th grade so that may have been why. But it was so messed up, I wasn't bullied at the parties, not mine or theirs, there were a few uncomfortable and unfortunate incidents but I wasn't teased about it at all the weeks after, still got invited to the next party. \n\nSo they could be nice and talk to me and the next day it was back to feeling hated, I don't know if they truly hated me but it sure felt that way.",

I was the new kid, and some well meaning classmate let me know what things to avoid doing because Rachel did them, so we didn't do them. Blue was Rachel's favorite color so when we got MnMs to count for a math thing, and then got to eat them, everyone threw out their blue ones! I didn't. Not because I was some hero or anything. I liked candy too much. But can you imagine a bunch of 9 year olds throwing away candy voluntarily?? \n\nI remember once having to walk with Rachel to get something from the office or something like that. And I tried to tell her what things she should stop doing so people would be nicer to her. I didn't have much of a clue as a kid. But she didn't really get it- looking back, I think she was probably autistic or something. But we ended up spending a fair bit of time together at recess and lunch, even though I tried  to distance myself somewhat because I was worried about becoming a target. I ended up leaving that school just a few months later, so I don't really remember if we were on the way to being friends or not.\n\nI hope she's doing ok now. I can't be too hard on my 9 year old self, but I wish I'd tried to stand up for her more than I did.",

Now I am absolutely *not* saying that any child deserves to be bullied, or lonely, because they\u2019re unusual - that\u2019s categorically not true - but these kids would generally have some trait or aspect of their personality that made other 9 year-olds prefer not to spend time with them. My politeness and relative conscience landed me on lots of play dates with classmates who were boring, or smelly, or uncomfortable to be around, or a bit scary. Also, because kids can be cruel, I was also risking becoming a target for bullying or alienation by association. \n\nTeach your kids not to be assholes because it\u2019s bad to be an asshole; but from someone who can remember being in the position of the 6 year old in this Tweet, I don\u2019t find this a particularly appealing consequence of being a nice kid.",

Her family was pretty poor so it wasn't much but I was glad I went there for her.",

He was a really sweet kid but he tried too hard and kids are mean so he wasn\u2019t popular. I made what I thought was a mistake at the time and let my mom see the invitation so I ended up \u201chaving\u201d to go. There were a lot of kids at the party, mostly younger neighborhood kids, but I was literally the only one from our class who was there. His parents went all out, too. It\u2019s been 30 years and I don\u2019t even remember his name but I promise you that\u2019s the only birthday party I remember from that year. I didn\u2019t appreciate it at the time but my mom was right to make me go.\n\nEdit: that all being said, I was bored AF at that party because the only person there I knew was the kid whose party it was and he was the center of attention. You couldn\u2019t have arranged to take another kid with us, mom?",

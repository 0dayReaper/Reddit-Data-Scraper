In the movie, nedry was written more assholish but in the book Hammond was written a lot more antagonistic towards Nedry.",

When nedry complained that he was doing work not in his contract and not getting compensation for it, Hammond threatened to sue him and then letters from ingen went to nedry's other clients proclaiming that nedry was lazy (book)\n\nIn the movie, they just made him a selfish asshole with vague problems. \n\nRealistically the park didn't fail because nedry shut off the security, the park failed because Hammond made a workplace so hostile his lead punching bag said fuck it.",

Long story short, the main island is the theme park, the other islands were all support &amp; research with shit working conditions. The reason the raptors in the 2nd film were fighting amongst themselves instead of doing stellar teamwork was because all the dinosaurs on that island had the equivalent of mad cow disease because the shitty labs allowed prions to develop.",

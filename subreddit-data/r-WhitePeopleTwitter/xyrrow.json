Show me your election sticker and I'll give you the whole day off if that's what it takes to get you to vote.\n\nI tell everyone I know that I'll give them a ride to the polls if they can't get there themselves. Our polls open at 7am. I will drag my lazy ass out of bed and have you there when they open the doors if that's what you need. I don't even care who you vote for, as long as you go. I mean this sincerely.\n\nNot one person has ever taken me up on it.",

It took 40 years of voting every single election and never giving up trying to produce multiple paths to victory waiting for the opportunity to arise to move. Now they got what they wanted.

I grew up in the religious right and they were single minded for the first 20 years of my life, never wavering their support for anti-abolition candidates down the fucking school board level.",

If there is a demographic that consistently votes even if the policies are terrible, politicians will try to gain that vote.",

Tons of 18 year olds living at home with parents that might want to \"see\" they're voting for who their parents want, domestic abuse situations, etc. Voting is done in private in a secure place for a reason.\n\nBut then there are so many trade offs with how you decide to do it. IMO it should be done as a digital thing with security 24/7 where you go into a little booth and hit buttons then leave, any hour of the day for a month. Armed security, only one in a booth at a time. One guard scans ID and validates and you enter your vote, and if you're registered it just works.",

The US is the only country I know of that has that. As a Canadian all we need to do is show we live in the right voting area. Most people will be sent a card with their names on it saying the dates and locations they can vote at. But if you don't get that you can show up with two pieces of ID. If you don't have that because you either just moved or are homeless or whatever reason you can literally have someone vouch for you and you sign a form saying this is truthful.\n\nAfter you have all that, then a national holiday would be useful.",

Check your Secretary of State website and they will have the details. You can also request mail-out voting in a lot of states. Yes, it sucks voting is made hard but stop using the excuse to not vote at all. However, I've been voting for years as a fulltime worker with early voting or mail-out voting. It is reality and we are to use the system we currently have in place and the one we wish for hasn't happened yet. It sure as hell won't happen with Republicans in office. They will only make it harder to vote.",

Conversely there are around 69 million boomers and 44 million of them voted in the same year. \n\nPlease vote. There is no small, individual act that has greater consequences.",

Sometimes I think that they want fascist oversight so they have something to talk about.  If you are one of those people, this is a world-changing election cycle.  If they get the majority between 2022 and 2024 you will get to live the rest of your useful life out in a country that wants to jail you.  Just remember that.  You can be the change you want to see, or to can live the way angry, white conservative, fascist males want you to.",

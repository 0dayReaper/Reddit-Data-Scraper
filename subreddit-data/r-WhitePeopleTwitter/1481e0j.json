I know the EU signaled that it can potentially ban Twitter, but as of late, there hasn\u2019t been much else. Like other platforms on the App Store get taken off for less shit, but there\u2019s so much currently wrong with the app. Content moderation is gone and there is practically nothing except for the occasional fact checker to showcase if something is false, the thing is lacking in self care and is buggy to all hell, the site has become infested with bots (more than it was before), and it\u2019s actively curating some of the worst people on the internet as a sort of mainstream 4chan.\n\nBut despite these obvious glaring problems, Twitter has only lost 8% of its total online traffic. Granted it\u2019s lost a fair bit of sponsors and money, but I truly think Elon is willing to keep dumping money on this dumpster fire as long as he gets to be head twit.\n\nThe only thing I can see to really do a fatal blow is a competitor like Bluesky coming in and ripping the site from major traffic. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen any time soon, or as effective as I hope it will be",

Some of the individual episodes are incredible, but its a different format. It's basically a book selling podcast where experts on different topics talk about their new research books briefly. Though, there are more in depth narrative summaries of crucial events in history. Overall, They're still worth listening to.",

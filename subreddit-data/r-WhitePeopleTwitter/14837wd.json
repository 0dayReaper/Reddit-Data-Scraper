What was more incredible was just the realisation that these tens of thousands of people exist all the time and you never notice because the majority of their lives are hidden from view. The number of groups there trying to give help and information to youths was amazing and if I'm being completely honest, based on the number of self-harm scars that I saw, beyond necessary.\n\nYou might not need a flag or a parade but, even in the most LGBTQIA+ friendly place in the world, there are way more people who do. Representation is how we demonstrate we are on the path towards equality and normalcy. It's how we get the next generation, who grow up seeing it as normal, to keep asking 'why don't we all have the same rights?' and to keep fighting for them.",

Yes, it's great that I can freely walk around my (liberal, coastal) city without fear. Yes, it's cool seeing posts like this on the front page of Reddit. It's nice. It's pleasant. It's cool.\n\nBut no amount of _nicety_ or _cool things_ even addresses the fact that **a third of trans youth** -- one in THREE -- live in states where they cannot access affirmative care _by law_. This is not a concerned or hysterical hypothetical; this is [the actual, legal reality _right now_](https://www.hrc.org/resources/attacks-on-gender-affirming-care-by-state-map). Florida, right now, is under a travel advisory (you know, the ones we use to designate entire countries that are unsafe) for LGBTQ+ people. Again, [not a hypothetical](https://eqfl.org/updated-travel-advisory-HRC). \n\n**[Many states are trying to ban affirmative care for adults](https://www.hrc.org/resources/attacks-on-gender-affirming-care-by-state-map)**, just in case you had it in your mind that this is about \"protecting children.\"\n\nWhat trans people **need** aren't flags, it's laws that protect us and our access to affirmative care. What trans people **need** aren't parades, but laws at the national level that preserve our ability to express who we are how we see fit -- and not be at risk for losing our jobs or our homes or our education as a result. \n\nSo here's the thing with pride parades and flags and (occasional) presidential mentions during the State of the Union: they give well-meaning people who really do care a sense that things are getting better and that what they are doing is working. \n\nBut for many, many trans people in the US, things are objectively getting worse with absolutely no hope in sight other than \"idk just move to another state?\"\n\nSo yeah. Forgive me if Pride is a source of **anger** for many of us this year. I'm just not very interested in being lectured on why parades are helping young trans people when the number of pride parades seems to grow in tandem with the number of laws that prohibit our existing in public.",

Before, it made me feel proud and patriotic for the sacrifices Americans made for the world. Now, it reminds me of the type of nationalism that injures a country and the world. A new flag would change this. And white nationalist can keep the current one to identify themselves and their attitude to their fellow humans.",

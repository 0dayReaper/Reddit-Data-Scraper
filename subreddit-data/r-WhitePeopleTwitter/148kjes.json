I think he did some shady shit that got a lot of people killed,  I\u2019m not advocating for him to be prosecuted because he didn\u2019t attempt a coup.\n\nI don\u2019t like Nixon.  I think he was a racist garbage human being.  But at least he had the decency to step down when he got caught doing illegal shit.  \n\nHacking the DNC e-mails was the GOP successfully doing what Nixon incompetently tried to do at Watergate.  No one was held accountable.\n\nAll the illegal shit Trump did in office that got his buddies thrown in prison didn\u2019t matter because he pardoned them.\n\nAt some point, you have to draw the line and I feel like (1) showing off classified documents like they\u2019re your prized baseball card collection and (2)  attempting to *overthrow the fucking government* are two places that, if we don\u2019t draw the line, it\u2019s time to just give up on the entire country, disband, and start over.  Because if you don\u2019t hold those lines, you don\u2019t have an actual country anymore.\n\nSo yes, I am happy that maybe, just maybe, the country is salvageable.",

Trump started having all of his ventures done by LLCs and then refusing to pay back the banks since it was the companies' debts.\n\nWell then the banks stopped loaning him. Unfortunately Trump had sizeable debts he was paying off himself and his ongoing ventures *at best* stay solvent. It's at this point that he laments that he is more broke than a homeless man, as the homeless man has nothing, but Trump has negative 200 million dollars.\n\nThis would have been the end of Trump, hadn't Deutsche Bank stepped in and granted him insanely generous loans. And mind you *those loans partially went to paying off Trump's debts to Deutsche Bank itself*. Something DB says they have no clue why they did that. Definitely don't look into their Wikipedia page for why DB would be doing that. \n\nAfter that Trump had some modest success in business. This was done mainly through his power of celebrity. Nearly everything that has had Trump's name in the past decade, was not actually Trump's. Trump licenses out his name to some schmuck along with promises of how he'll use his business acumen to guarantee their success, then takes a massive fee for his participation and washes his hands of the entire thing when it fails. Schmuck goes bankrupt, and Trump walks away a little richer. Point out that his business failed, and he'll (rightfully) point out that it was just a licensed use of his name and downplays his role in the entire thing.\n\nThe other way he achieved success was through mysterious buyers. A lot of Trump projects would see massive interest immediately, which was surprising to many (imagine people buying apartments 4 years before construction will be finished). Now we enter into conspiracy territory: \n\nSome people believe, myself included, that Trump had been bought out and now helped rich foreign elites to stash and launder money. Trump would make a tower and they would funnel money to him. Trump would sell them some apartments and make sure nobody would look at the money or demand to know where it came from (Kushner famously maintains total anonymity for his customers). This way Trump would always have guaranteed customers and the elites could stash money away from their home country if the winds changed.",

There seemed to be something fundamentally broken about establishment politicians and I hoped he would be the answer. He was not. He was way worse and simply proved to me that there are reasons that the establishment has evolved into what it is today. That the establishment isn't necessarily a bad thing. Alas, I grew disillusioned that I could be so wrong and although Trump seemed likeable enough. He just kept spewing the most heinous things and became blatantly drunk on power. I came to realize he wasn't as stupid as liberal media made him seem, but rather he just didn't care! He acted as if he was above the law and only cared about cutting taxes for the rich and hurting the people who disagreed with him.\n\nIronically, I do believe that Trump deserved to be indicted on principle. Unlike Clinton, Biden or Pence it's easily proven that he took the documents with intent to obstruct authorities. He is so selfish he didn't care about national security. The documents were about leveraging money and power to him. Literally no other President, including Nixon has ever been so blatantly corrupt and unconcerned about the welfare of the American people.\n\nHe absolutely deserved to rot in a jail cell on the principle that he put his own selfish interest above us. Clinton, Biden and Pence are guilty of carelessness at best.",

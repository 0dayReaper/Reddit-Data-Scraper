They couldn't figure out the issue, so she was taken by another ambulance to the main clinic. \n\nSpent 5 days in ped ICU. 4 lumbar drains later she was released. Then taken to the hospital pick up/release area in a wheelchair. When they stood her up she collapsed. \n\nSo they had to readmit her to the er then back to the ICU for two more days. \n\nI have given up processing the situation and laugh at the bill, because it's absolutely impossible to pay.\n\nThe itemized coding for the bill is like 12 pages long.",

He assumed that part was subsumed into the $50k surgery that was under his insurance several weeks before while he was still employed. Apparently it wasnt and the uninsured bill for him for pin removal was $9000. He didnt pay for it in 30 days and it was sent straight to collections. This was before we met and seven or eight years later while buying a house with me we had to delay house buying a couple years because of that. That meant the house we were looking at (to build new) went up 50k in those two years. we rented at $1000 a month an extra two years\u2026we paid a few extra for \u201cpoints\u201d to get the mortgage interest rate down somewhat due to his credit score from the collections on his record making our rate higher. \n\nSo because he was unemployed for three weeks during the recession and needed pins removed from his arm from a surgery that was covered by insurance, the cause and effect of all that was many many tens of thousands of dollars for us in the long run. This is the ballooning financial bullshit millennials and beyond have had to deal with that some older peoole do not fucking get. This is why i at 40 with an advanced degree and a double income household and not being crazy spenders, im struggling more than my no ambition middle management father who was the only income ans could afford to send three kids to private school while supporting a gambling problem",

How is it that insurance companies can deny a patient treatment that their doctor recommends? \n\nOf course, this is just the right to privacy, but I know my state (Oregon) is toying with declaring health care an explicit right as well!

Got a bill in the mail a month later for $800 more for the vasectomy that somehow costs all together over $7000 through my provider (wellstar). To top it all off, if I had shopped around instead of going through my normal physician and healthcare network, I would\u2019ve known that I could get the exact same procedure through a clinic for $600 in and out 100% paid for no insurance needed. But instead I\u2019m fighting wellstar and they\u2019re sending everything i \u201cowe\u201d them to collections so that my credit score takes a shit and I can no longer afford to buy my own house because no lender will touch me with a ten foot pole. \n\nYay america!",

When my fiance was hit in the parking lot of BaRT, hit and run and she was a pedestrian, the ambulance tried to take her to 1 place but they wouldnt accept Medicare so they drove her in pain 20 min back to the er hospital in our town. They then sat her in a room for hours until they could verify she had Medicare then gave her morphine(before asking if she had allergies etc or even asking her condition) put an immobilizer on her leg ans said \"you have to sit her for 2 hrs then get someone to pick you up,\" and just left her alone in the room. She later recieved an ambulance bill for an ambulance she didnt call(or need her manager was willing to drive her but the BaRT police wouldnt let her.) Then to top it off she also got the full bill from the hospital eventhough it was a covered visit thru Medicare and had to fight for yrs to get them to pay both bill, they however refused to pay for 70% of the ambulance ride saying in more words \"its not our fault you got forcefully put into an ambulance you should have said something,\" but that was after they sent the bill to collections after saying \"all your bills were paid in full under emergency medi-cal and medicare.\" She then had to pay a few $1000 over a few yrs to fix her credit so we could move out of my horrible moms place. Fuck the US and its rigged systems, seems like the govt wants a true insurrection to tear down every fabric of its shitiness instead of fixing itself.",

I have a sneaking feeling that the 40k here is a billing trick and the actual cost to the hospital is much closer to 8k. No I'm not a conspiracy theorist... But here's my theory backed by a very small piece of evidence - \n\n\nProviders and Insurance companies are in cahoots, resulting in you paying for almost all of your healthcare costs by the way of premiums + copays + deductibles. A small example is my eyecare for this year... From previous years and in talking to friends, I discovered that getting my glasses at pretty much any optician would end up costing me about $200 after the insurance allowance which is $150. So I went to Costco to get my glasses whose price for frames + lenses came to a total of about $150. So I should be fully covered, right? But nope! Apparently at places like Costco and Walmart where the prices are cheaper, my insurance only pays half of the allowance. This to me is total bait and switch... Why should the insurance company care where I get my glasses as long as I stay within the limits that they provide me? In this case, I'm shopping around for the cheapest option and got punished for that\n\n[This is a picture of my insurance allowances](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/rcorzu/insurance_in_us_punishing_you_for_making_cost/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)",

My mom says it's because they paid for it; if you look at your SS statement, you'll see that all the Medicare tax you ever paid (unless you made a LOT of money) wouldn't even cover one hospitalization. Some of that money comes from other people.",

My point was that healthcare in the US military is terrible, even though it is free. I was not implying that the same would be true for a civilian system. The healthcare in the US military is bad because of two reasons, neither of which are cost: \n\n1. Culture. Even getting medical care is seen as weakness, even by those administering it. \n\n2. The actual system. See, you don't actually just go to the doctor, you first have to go to something called \"sick call\", which is where a combat medic who only knows how to give you ibuprofen and stop holes in your body from leaking blood decides whether or not you are \"actually sick enough to see a doctor\". If by some miracle he says yes, you get to go see a PA lieutenant whose job isn't to actually help you, but to do whatever he can to get you back to work. \n\nSide note: this entire process is why the VA is flooded with people with preventable chronic injuries. They either weren't given proper care, or avoided care until it became too big a problem to ignore due to fear of being judged. (If you have any kind of medical issue that isn't directly inflicted by the enemy, your career is over)",

Unfortunately the ER I went to didn\u2019t have an OBGYN on staff which is needed for how far along I was. So they said they had to transfer me via ambulance. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m missing a foot or stabbed, no. Not happening. I signed a form saying I was leaving against their advice so my partner could drive me to the 19 minute away ER where I stumbled to the maternity section that could help me. Still can\u2019t believe they made me fill out paperwork while I could barely function and the first round of pain meds did absolutely nothing.\n\nEdit: the paperwork I\u2019m referencing was not the AMA I signed with the first ER, but stuff I needed to sign for insurance and in order for me to receive care. I have no idea what I signed due to the level of pain even though someone was talking me through it over the phone, I could barely understand her while I was sobbing.",

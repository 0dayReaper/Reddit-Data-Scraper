We actually have a representative democracy where corporations vote with dollars by installing politicians that they think will represent their best interests. They also have their lobbyists write bills, which the congressmen and women they have elected then enact into law. We also have the executive branch which chooses only to enforce the laws those corporations use for profit, and ignores or redacts the laws which cost them money, time, and effort. These really bad, nasty laws (a.k.a. \"regulations\") would protect the surrounding communities and the rest of the country from pollution and corruption, but are a detriment to the purpose of our democracy, which is to make as much money for the rich as quickly as possible. See! It totally works! Nothing to it.\n\nEdit: We also have the courts, which for the last 40 years have been packed with ideologues that side with those same corporations, because [corporations are people, my friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlPQkd_AA6c). Oh, and also the courts are really doing their very best to get government out of people's lives by monitoring every single pregnancy in the US. It's just the best functioning democracy in the world!",

There were so many ridiculous voting issue the day before and night of 2016 that they were literally glossed over. Watching it happen real-time was incredible. Too much to handle, too much to process. I know time is an issue but it's so frustrating that people can game the system so openly and almost never face consequences. \n\nI mean shit, why NOT cheat?",

These fake boxes were set up by Republicans, at right-leaning locations such as right outside gun stores, and they then told their base where they all are.  So, the Republicans party will collect all these ballots (apparently illegally according CAs harvesting laws, I am not a resident)  and then either \"lose\" them or just not count them (or be unable to due to the collection of them being illegal), and use this as \"evidence\" that Democrats are the ones to blame.\n\nLong story short it is just more projection by the right.  They accuse the left of doing bad things, but almost every time its actually the right doing it, had been doing it, and continuing to do it, to an exponentially worse degree than they're accusing the left of.  And their base falls for it 100% of the time.",

And fixing a \"cut-cable\" doesn't take 5-10 minutes, you have no idea what you're talking about. Backhoe cuts a cable and you might have an hour or two before they figure out what the cable is, who owns it, and can get a team on site. Then they gotta clear debris and dig a clean path to the cable. They have to get a splice trailer to the fiber so that they can access it cleanly, this could be a serious problem in construction areas. It will take an hour to set up equipment and get everyone informed on what exactly needs to be done. Then a REALLY good splicer can splice 2-3 fibers a minutes. It is a very delicate process. These cables can be anywhere from 6 strands of fiber to 244 or more. And they might be bundled in conduit with multiple types of cable they have to sort through. These fixes can take hours or even days. My splicer buddies have made several grand before to spend an entire weekend fixing ONE conduit.",

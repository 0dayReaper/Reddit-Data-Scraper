I don't think it'd happen all at once, and I think it'd happen state by state and election by election- not with some sweeping new presidential candidate disrupting the 2020 or even 2024 ballot- but I think it's something people are becoming a lot more conscious about and something that's due to change eventually.\n\nMinneapolis, New York City, Los Angeles, Dallas, Buffalo, Louisville, Seattle, and Philadelphia *all* have Democrat mayors, and for all intents and purposes Democrats in charge of the city. Despite this, you probably thought I was literally just listing cities where police brutality happened in the past couple weeks. I'm not saying the Republicans are any better, and I'm not saying both sides are the same. I'm saying that the American people are in a false ditchotomy where, for hundreds of years now, we've been pressured to believe that whatever problem we have, voting for the opposite political party will fix it. Our generation is starting to become more well aware of the facts of the matter and realizing that neither privately run organization controlled by the oldest and wealthiest people in our country have our interests at heart. Change isn't going to happen through them, we have to make it happen through us.",

If we had a parliamentary system where a party that got 10% of the vote got 10% of the seats, then we\u2019d see third parties with actual power. Instead, it\u2019s a winner-takes-all system.

Police unions are unaccountable and have a huge amount of power and progressives have their careers ended by having to be accounted for an untouchable police force. Any political threat to their funding or status is met with a Purposeful slow down of response times and an overt message that a lack of funding is why cops can\u2019t show up to do their duty. Being soft on crime is a death knell for local officials and police unions know it. \n\nThe problem is deeper and more systemic than any legislative action can get at and chalking the problem off to complicit mayors is naive. I guarantee that any DSA/green/independent/activist mayor will face the exact same roadblocks. The police need to be defunded and dismantled and until now,  the overwhelming local vote has been in the opposite direction.",

They basically lucked into shit, found a way to make money off it while fucking everyone else over, then pretended it\u2019s due to skill or hard work or something. \n\nMy boomer mom got given a job in the family business and a tract of land by her parents after flunking out of college, then her husband took care of the house costs and her in general after that. Then she inherited houses and businesses and money when her parents passed. She\u2019s basically sold all of it and passed nothing down, but hey at least she has a 3 story house overlooking the beach with all remodeled kitchen and bathrooms that she\u2019s \u2018worked so hard for all these years\u2019 according to her. \n\nShe\u2019s literally been handed shit on a platter her entire life yet feels very qualified to talk about jobs and money and economy, foreign politics, etc. Some shit you go \u2018oh yeah that\u2019s a good point\u2019, but 90% of topics you just already know her view is so skewed and sheltered to as almost be meaningless. It\u2019s actually kind of sad to see someone who\u2019s been so taken care of her entire life that reality doesn\u2019t really apply to her thinking processes, and how easy it is to discount her input almost immediately on most topics due to it only applying to her and her friends who lead similar cushy lives.",

The eleventh died in his 50s post office, but that was from a cholera outbreak.  John Adams made it to 90, and plenty of early presidents made it into their 80s.  Life expectancy and average age has definitely gone up, but not *that* considerably.  \n\nThe reason that you see things like the average life expectancy was in the 30s in the early 1800s isn't because everyone was dropping dead at 50, its because plenty of women died in childbirth and because infant mortality was through the roof.  Advancements in child care and birthing is whats contributed to the significant rise in life expectancy, not that everyone is living to be Methuselah.  That isn't to say congresses average hasn't gone up, it clearly has, but presidents have never been young on average.",

There are age-old quotes about it.  The fall of the roman republic is probably the example that fits most closely with ours.  The real problem is that every generation becomes the generation they hated.  Unless someone breaks the chain, millennials will just be the next baby boomers in 20-40 years.

You are correct, there were examples.\n\nI will respectfully disagree on Boomers being similar to their predecessors and future generations.\n\nNever has a generation taken so much for themselves in our society.  They are the beneficiaries of the post Ww2 boom, which catapulted them to insane amounts of prosperity for essentially simply being alive and American.\n\nWhere is the kindness from them to their offspring?  We have a healthcare system based on tax breaks and blood money.  Corporations regularly flout the law and are seldom held to account for trillions in fraud, much of which is government sanctioned.  Their pension system is lavish, but not available for the rest of society.  The unions are basically siphons of member dues when not busted completely.\n\nI know some very decent, good Boomers.  I do.  But as a generational cohort, they are the equivalent of Montgomery Burns.",

My first election after moving here, they questioned my voter registration at the polls and gave me a provisional ballot and said it would be counted after they verified my credentials, if I was actually eligible. Likewise I had issues re-registering after I moved apartments, and they acted like I had moved for the sake of committing voter fraud and not because I'm a student and we tend to move a lot. My old polling place was in a small church way off in East bumblefuck and away from the bus lines, if I didn't have a car it would be difficult to even make it to the polls, and my first time voting at the poll I walked into the church looking for the polling place and one of the workers there told me she didn't even think there was an election that day. My new polling place is in a different church and similarly poorly signed. \n\nNot to mention I end up being scheduled to work every Election Day and we don't get out of classes for elections so I either have to run out on my lunch break (if I get one) or go early early morning or after work, because I work two jobs in addition to being a full time student. And voting absentee was an absolute fiasco, the postal service doesn't serve my apartment complex very well so it took a month and a half between submitting my absentee ballot request and actually getting my ballot - plus to submit the request you needed to have access to a printer and mailing supplies, and they closed the public library printer and the in-person absentee ballot requests at the board of elections due to COVID. Compare this to my grandma, who had someone come to her nursing home and help them all register for absentee ballots. If my state hadn't expanded the date range to vote absentee, my vote wouldn't have counted at all. Oh, and early voting at the board of elections is a bit over 30 minutes away by car, and quite a bit longer by bus because it's off in west bumblefuck, and apparently there was such a huge line to vote early that I would have been stuck waiting for hours - which I really can't afford to do because two minimum wage jobs and I don't get vacation time.\n\nThere's very real, systemic barriers in place to keep young people from voting. I get that none of them is an absolute obstacle that 100% prevents someone from voting, but voting shouldn't be a hassle for anyone.",

That only becomes harder after an impeachment because it's another political stone around his neck.\n\nPence wants to get out of this pretending he was just along for the ride as the party VP pick. He doesn't want any of that. If he did he'd have done something performative on the 6'th to make Trump happy.",

It was a direct threat to the life of their own idol\u2019s right hand man. Thats why Pence was the one to actually take charge and mobilize the national guard while trump resisted. What the fuck is going on in the world man.\n\nEdit: I stand corrected, I was misinformed about the shot being fired by a member of the Secret Service but it was actually a capitol police officer. Someone DM\u2019ed me suggesting that I am intentionally spreading misinformation because I am a Trumper, but hopefully after seeing this edit you will see that that is not the case and I am making a legitimate effort to only post accurate info. I just got one detail wrong lol.",

I cant imagine any reason someone would care whether it was secret service or capitol police.\n\nEdit: this is only a rant about someone blaming you for \"spreading misinformation\".

The scope of very narrow so they don't burn time to prepare. There is precedent - Andrew Johnson was impeached 3 days after he fired the Secretary of War.\n\nI think by now 5 Republican Senators have publicly called for his resignation, meaning there are currently at least 53 yes votes, with the total needing to reach 66 (because there are only 99 seated Senators at the moment). I don't think McConnell would necessarily be against it at this point since the Trump brand is getting more toxic by the day.\n\nThey could also technically wait until Warnock and Ossoff are seated and Biden takes office to have the Senate trial after the fact, which doesn't help the immediate threat but does prevent him from holding office again.",

I still _cannot_ wrap my brain around how easily that hypocritical orange jackal travelled and spent  government money during those travels...in his _own_ businesses.

Golfed like he thought he was going to be invited to the PGA. Throwing government funded covid parties at Marlago. I can't believe how openly it's just been going on.",

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\nTerry Pratchett, Men at Arms",

But it requires that a business be focused on long-term growth and not short term gains, and there's the real crux of the problem with our current C-suite culture.\n\nWhen I started managing over 20 years ago, I was taught that turnover is expensive, so paying employees well and having employees who were satisfied enough to stick around was part of the goal of management.\n\nThen the world changed. I don't know which of the many changes made to benefit the C-suites and shareholders contributed to this problem the most, but now everything is focused on things like year-over-year growth and short-term profit. Our corporations are being gutted by the billionaire class and the wannabe billionaire class.\n\nDan Price didn't invent anything revolutionary. He's just moving against the current, and I'm really glad he exists. Because he puts the lie to all these CEOs who claim increased labor costs will decimate their businesses, when the truth is paying employees more will increase the long-term stability of their businesses. It just won't line CEO pockets with fat bonuses.",

They did not give a fuck about the workers. Each meeting they wanted millions more in EBITDA, despite the vast majority of our EBITDA being addbacks (basically our EBITDA numbers were based in delusion). 401k cuts, no raises, no bonuses (for us peons), many heads chopped. The c suite bonuses weren't even cut, like they said they would be, they were just fucking delayed lmao. I knew this because I also managed our cash. \n\nI was safe in my position but I ultimately left that company for one that really cares about its employees and it shows. They pay more, they are super patient, they've made no cuts and continue to hire, and they seriously listen to our opinions. I look back at that last job and it really proves the stereotypes of corporate america true. All that private equity group wanted was to have stellar numbers this year so they could sell it off.",

So I essentially did some job searching in my own time, found a much better opportunity, took it. Handed in my resignation, they took it well (initially), and then when asked if I had anything else planned after leaving, I said of course and that I\u2019ve already got something lined up. They seemed to take that personally, asking when I was going to tell them I was looking for something else and when I was going to tell them I was thinking about quitting... my response: I have told you all you legally need to know when you legally need to know it. What my thoughts are is none of your business, when I was planning and what I was planning for when I\u2019m gone from here is none of your business. Yes, I could have told you then and there that I was contemplating leaving this job when I was refused a pay raise for easily double the work and was threatened with being fired (and even threatened with a bad recommendation letter, which is illegal by German/European worker\u2019s laws). \n\nMoral of the story, don\u2019t treat workers like crap and then be butthurt when you don\u2019t get loyalty in return.",

If you feel you can get away with it you can even make a few paycuts on the employees you think won't quit.\n\nSince you know the business is going to fall apart eventually this way, you start selling off equipment, property ahead of time.\n\nAnd in the end, the point of all of this was to cause your stock to skyrocket, so you can sell all your stock for many many times more than the company was ever worth.\n\nIn the end you move the money offshore, declare bankruptcy, and hire 20 lawyers to eliminate any pesky debt.\n\nSimply changung the way the stock market analysis business growth to give it a more long term perspective would make this entire process much less effective. Rapid cuts in expenses do not actually equal profit growth in real life, but right now on paper they are the same thing.",

If someone buys that business and replaces the employees with minimum wage workers, the labor cost is cut down to only about $750,000 per year with the remainder of the revenue going to operating costs and the boss\u2019s pocket. Obviously things like quality and turnover shit the bed but if you\u2019re only looking at a short (~2-5 year) investment you can squeeze out about $11 million before moving on just by replacing the employees. Granted everything I\u2019ve stated is super random and arbitrary but this hopefully just gives you an idea.",

That doesnt even make sense.

He's still making plenty of money, he still owns a valuable company, he's still doing incredibly well financially. He's probably just much happier now as well. It wasn't a sacrifice, it was a smart choice.\n\nIn the long term, it seems like an obvious choice? It's just that is easy to measure money, and hard to quantify happiness. So people tend to focus on the thing that's *easy to measure* instead of the things that are *actually important*. And they miss simple, easy, solutions that would make them definitely better off, just because they're focusing on what's easiest to think about, instead of what's actually going to change their lives.",

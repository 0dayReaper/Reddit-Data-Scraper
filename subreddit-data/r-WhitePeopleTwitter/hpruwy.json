I'm not going to pretend that I am a tax accountant but I can give you a few reasons why. Some companies donate money to get tax write-offs. So all those rich people and celebrates that donated to Covid-19 will be able to write-off that money (The money does help and I'm sure is appreciated by whoever received it). Also, if you own a company anything used for the  business is pretty much a write-off. Companies only pay taxes on the money that they made after expenses. There are a lot of gray area and illegal ways funds get hidden by people and companies. Offshore accounts and registering the company in other countries is a big way assets are hidden. A lot of people were mad at cruise companies that were asking for bail outs and we're registered in a different country recently. Some people use avenues that will pretty much wash the money (very illegal). That's what a shell corporation pretty much does. This is also what the church of Scientology has been accused of doing but it hasn't been proven (I have no idea what Scientology does). Through years of watching the news, documentaries, and heist movies this is pretty much my best answer.",

Just google amazon 10k. \n\nAmazon does not have a lot of profit because they pour money into R&amp;D type expense buckets as you were mentioning. Which is why we get our two day shipping. \n\nSaying that companies donate for the tax write off is not nearly accurate. If a company has 100,000.00 in extra cash and they donate 100k to avoid 21k in taxes they are idiots. Now they have $0 extra money. They would have been better off paying their 21k in taxes. \n\nThey donate for philanthropy purposes based on plans set within their business. This is to assist in keeping the economy going, giving to community,  improving good will,  helps secure better deals with other companies that are partners, etc. there is way more to it than to just avoid taxes. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nSource: helped to write and implement several of these plans.",

So, where to start?\n\n[The ultra-rich have as much as $32 trillion hidden away in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand the magnitude of the number 32 trillion (32,000,000,000,000) let's use time as an example. One million seconds is only 12 days, but one billion seconds is 31 years. So there's a massive difference between a million and a billion, much more than people realize. But how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.\n\nPeople know it's an issue but they don't understand just how extreme it can be. Here's an example: **If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much wealth as Jeff Bezos.** And yes his wealth isn't all in cash, but he wouldn't want it to be. If you had $100 billion all in cash then you would effectively lose a billion dollars every year or so, due to inflation. But if you invest it then you can make over a billion dollars every year without doing any work.\n\nI've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is. I've come to the conclusion that there are underlying flaws in the system. Quite frankly, the game is rigged and almost everyone is getting screwed. So I've put together some information to help illustrate it.\n\n**Graphs:**\n\n\u2022 [Possibly the most important graph ever: productivity is increasing but wages are stagnant, all the profit is going to the wealthy](https://i.ibb.co/412gVpH/Screen-Shot-2013-03-08-at-11-36-19-AM.png)\n\n\u2022 [When adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has actually been falling since 1970](https://i.ibb.co/FDLBPs0/wage-chart.png)\n\n\u2022 [Distribution of U.S. income](https://i.ibb.co/0XJVkXH/OSX-Ethics-08-04-Avg-Income.jpg)\n\n\u2022 [Distribution of average U.S. income growth during expansions](https://i.ibb.co/4mn2BNg/qDWnA4s.jpg)\n\n\u2022 [Income inequality in the U.S. compared to western Europe](https://i.ibb.co/JzTswsZ/inequality.jpg)\n\n\u2022 [Inequality is still an issue in Europe though, here's the distribution of German wealth](https://i.ibb.co/Gsy8wpb/screen-shot-2018-01-31-at-12-07-49-am.png)\n\n\u2022 [U.S. economic mobility compared to other developed countries](https://i.ibb.co/sCr7NdS/Relative-Social-Mobility-of-Wealthy-Nations-2-1024x639.jpg)\n\n\u2022 [Taxes for the richest Americans have plummeted over the last 50 years](https://i.ibb.co/mzjm1Sj/Fake-Candid-Dungbeetle-size-restricted.gif)\n\n\u2022 [Amazing info-graphic about U.S. economics over time](https://i.ibb.co/wR3PY5D/e8t78dn0d5h21.png)\n\n\u2022 [In addition to all of that, there's another layer of inequality as well](https://i.ibb.co/bd27TM7/e4uoe4w8z6r31.jpg)\n\n**Videos:**\n\n\u2022 [A quick illustration of wealth inequality in America](https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM)\n\n\u2022 [Corporations have more of an effect on U.S. law than the public](https://youtu.be/5tu32CCA_Ig)\n\n\u2022 [Rich people don't create jobs](https://youtu.be/CKCvf8E7V1g)\n\n\u2022 [Neo-feudalism explained](https://youtu.be/j0R8bXrUCgg)\n\n\u2022 [How American CEOs got so rich](https://youtu.be/ylLTMYt24lA)\n\n\u2022 [The origins of conservatism](https://youtu.be/E4CI2vk3ugk)\n\n\u2022 [Neoliberalism explained](https://youtu.be/7gQFvf19Jec)\n\n\u2022 [Why inequality matters](https://youtu.be/XLJl0AdhPjE)\n\n\u2022 [Beware fellow plutocrats: pitchforks are coming](https://youtu.be/q2gO4DKVpa8)\n\n\u2022 [The new feudalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-2TEwdRnX0)\n\n\u2022 [Wealth and inheritance](https://youtu.be/QzQYA9Qjsi0)\n\n\u2022 [The Money Masters](https://youtu.be/HBk5XV1ExoQ?t=22)\n\n\u2022 [Flaws of capitalism](https://youtu.be/6P97r9Ci5Kg)\n\n**Articles:**\n\n\u2022 [Wonderful article about minimum wage, inflation and cost of living](http://amhill.net/2016/08/04/minimum-wage-vs-cost-of-living/)\n\n\u2022 [Small farms are being consolidated up into big agriculture](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/07/23/concentration-in-u-s-agriculture/)\n\n\u2022 [\"Is curing patients a sustainable business model?\"](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html)\n\n\u2022 [Study shows that you're more likely to be successful if you're born rich and dumb than poor and smart](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/12/would-you-rather-be-born-smart-or-rich/281828/)\n\n\u2022 [This scientific study concluded that banks can create money out of thin air](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070)\n\n**Quotes:**  \n\n&gt;**\u201cNo business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.

There's no world in which a company will eat the costs and give up revenue. (I'm sure there might be some exceptions. But just see what happens every single time a country implements tariffs. Who ends up paying for it? The workers.)",

It\u2019s a massive brake on growth, and is much higher than a 10% tax in reality because most corporate taxes are profit based. For Facebook it would be around a 30% tax, and Facebook has a fantastic profit margin.  For Amazon or Walmart it would be a greater than 300%+ tax.\n\nTo be fair, the post does say it would be a VAT, so yeah, that is a sales tax, something commonly passed along.  And also a regressive tax in the case of something like Amazon or Walmart so that\u2019s interesting.  I don\u2019t understand at all why it\u2019s a liberal principle.",

This is because wealth taxes are extremely expensive to enforce and very easy to avoid. The result was that most counties were taking in a very small amount of money VS the cost to actually collect. \n\nPart of the reason for this is that despite articles that claim \u201cJeff Bezos is worth X billion dollars\u201d, actually calculating how much wealth a person has is not an exact science. France has a wealth tax, and they are constantly embroiled in lawsuits over how much value a person actually has. Unlike other things, like lying about income or charitable donations, valuation is much more subjective - so it\u2019s hard to show that somebody is lying, rather than just being pessimistic. \n\n2- it\u2019s a non-approportioned direct tax, and is therefore unconstitutional in the US. This means constitutional amendment to make it happen, which means it\u2019s basically impossible. Some people make arguments that they are legal today, but the overwhelming majority of legal experts believe SCOTUS would find them illegal without an amendment - we have a clear precedent with income taxes in the US, which also required an amendment. \n\n3- wealth taxes encourage people to move wealth out of your economy, which is bad for the economy.\n\n4- if we want to increase tax revenue, there\u2019s a much easier way to do it - fund the IRS more. For every dollar we give the IRS, they manage to collect three more in tax revenue. They\u2019re pretty underfunded right now, so our existing taxes aren\u2019t being collected correctly.",

There was a golden age when the top were taxed and the middle class was strong.\n\nBut since Reaganomics, and the lie of trickle down fed to the average person, since the 80s it has gotten progressively worse\n\nThere are some blips from the 80s to the present, like Clinton presedency during one of the biggest economic expansions in the US. \n\nThe middle class is dwindling, and corporations only care about their bottom line and paying out large sums to shareholders and upper management while strangling the upward mobility and salary of the workers that actually drive profits. \n\nAmerica needs a general strike. If every worker decided that no we won't put up with it anymore, and went on strike. These corporations/shareholders would see their profits plummet.\n\nUPS teamsters had a strike in 1997 which cost UPS hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done, it's just a matter of how bad people want to fight for their right to a living or thriving wage. Gotta stick it to the man",

During the pandemic, we had 'essential workers' who received a meager pay raise, but then the grocery stores decided that they were cutting 'too much' into their massive profits so they abandoned the slight raise. This is tragically happening in every industry.",

What is, is extreme wealth for the few and extreme poverty for most everyone else, with a small professional class that does ok.  As we saw from the 30's to the 80's, regulation and tax policy can be used to make the economy work for everyone.  You take that 90%+ top marginal rate away (that effectively acted as an income cap) and the middle class begins to evaporate.\n\nIt's the role of government to organize the rules in a way that makes the economy work for the people, not the people work for the economy.  There is no more destructive combination of words in the last century than \"free market\".",

Sixteen Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.\n\n&gt;**Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court**, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.\n\nBut sure, no similarities to modern American conservatives, not at all.

Most importantly it means not participating in wars, the rest is pretty much politics and the spectrum of possibilities is large.

People _finally_ got angry and demanded real actions while almost all parties urged the federal council to act too.",

They don\u2019t feel threatened by Putin enough to think that they need to remain neutral in case of the war reaching them, and they recon the financial benefits of strengthening their relation to EU outweighs the possible loss of business with a considerably weaker economy like Russia\u2019s. \n\nOf course I won\u2019t deny that their reasons also are beyond financial, but I think that the financial situation is vastly different from other wars like the world wars where Switzerland has chosen neutrality.",

America can't be a third world country, third world isn't defined by econ, it's defined by alliances. You're third world if you did not ally with NATO or the Warsaw Pact during the cold war. That's the only way to be a third world nation, since America is a founding member of NATO it cannot be third world. You see why you're stupid for using this world now?\n\n If you're talking econ you mean core nations, semi-periphery nations, and periphery nations. These are actually defined by levels of industrialization, civilization, wealth, etc. Regardless America is still a core nation with parts that are definitely semi-periphery. Just throwing around third world like it matters as a definitions to anyone in 2023 makes you look ignorant. People just talk about shit they have no meaningful education in and it shows. The point isn't made except to other idiots who are like \"hurr durr third world means poor.\" It's a real race to the bottom with you guys.",

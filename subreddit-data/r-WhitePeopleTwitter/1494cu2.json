Only reason she was a \"bad candidate\" is because suddenly she was running for president and the GOP couldn't let that go. \n\nIn retrospect, her defense of her husband is pretty scummy. Bill is a sexual predator, and she should have walked away from him instead of trying to defend him. So, that's not great. But other than that, yeah, she was incredibly popular. In fact, still popular enough to win the popular vote!",

People forget how much culture has changed. 30 years ago was a completely different time politically, and divorcing a sitting president would\u2019ve been *unbelievable.* \n\nShe was a victim in that situation - first, it\u2019s not her responsibility to right Bill\u2019s wrongs. Secondly, think about her position and what it would\u2019ve been like for her to actually make that choice and potentially blow up her entire life and career. She had political aspirations from the beginning, too. She wasn\u2019t just a FLOTUS-turned-Senator. Being forced to navigate the public-facing traditional supportive wife role, while being openly humiliated from all angles, raising a young daughter, and dealing with your own actual emotions and grief from your extremely exposed marriage issues\u2026.I think people really underestimate what Hillary has persevered. People expect women to handle every situation flawlessly, because they\u2019re  expected to be peacekeepers and accommodators. Then they\u2019re criticized for everything anyway . Its bullshit.",

A whole lot of republicans did. Usually right after meeting with trump. \n\nOne of the biggest changes trump made was that the conspiracies used to come from *outside* the house. Once trump took over the Republican Party, the conspiracies started coming from inside the house. \n\nPutin did the same thing in Russia. It\u2019s a very effective tool for distraction.",

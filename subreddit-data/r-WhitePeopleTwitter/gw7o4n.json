This keeps a healthy balance between enough profits to sustain a business while still protecting and empowering the workers. However a government doesn't go bankrupt. If the unions demand more pay or benefits, that comes from the taxpayers pockets by force. They can progressively extort more and more out of people and there is little recourse people can take without going through politics. Meanwhile in the private example, people can simply, and immeadiately, stop buying a product if it becomes too expensive because a union demanded far too much.",

These are mostly all things that are no brainers that shouldn't even be an issue to enact with most departments tomorrow. The other list floating around a few days ago with the 5 items was way more thorough and seemed like it would actually work out.  Until we have a completely separate organization investigating and police, nothing is going to change. It's almost like the 8cantwait was created by police because not enough is changing internally. Who's going to determine if the cop was using his firearm as a last resort, is that not already what they're being trained??\n\n\nEdit: those 5 items\n\nThis is not mine.  pasted from another thread,  pls spread and let's have some lasting change \n\n5 DEMANDS, NOT ONE LESS.\n\n1. Create an independent inspector body to investigate police misconduct and criminal allegations and controls evidence like body camera footage.\n2. \u2060Create a requirement for states to establish board certification with minimum education and training requirements to provide licensing for police. In order to be a law enforcement officer, you must possess this license. The inspector body in #1 can revoke the license.\n3. \u2060Refocus police resources on training, de-escalation, and community building.\n4. Adopt the \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d doctrine for lethal force as implemented in other states.\n5. \u2060Codify into law the requirement for police to have positive control over the evidence chain of custody. If the chain of custody is lost for evidence, the investigative body in #1 can hold law enforcement officers and their agencies liable.\n\nThese 5 demands are the minimum necessary for trust in our police to return. Until these are implemented by our state governors, legislators, DAs, and judges we will not rest or be satisfied. We will no longer stand by and watch our brothers and sisters be oppressed by those who are meant to protect us.",

Police officers in the US have had 19 weeks of training on average before they are let loose on the streets, often patrolling solo. I don't know much about the vatting process of the applicants in America, but if the slapdash training serves as an indicator there might be room for improvement too.\n\nIn Germany for example there is a strict vatting procedure including psychological evaluation, physical fitness and other aptitude tests. This is followed by 2 - 3 years of school and training on the job, depending on the chosen career path. The schooling consists mainly of courses in law, psychology and criminology.\nI can't recall seeing German police officers  alone, they usually patrol in pairs which makes it easier to deescalate situations. The use of firearms is seen as the very last resort, they are rarely drawn and almost never used. In 2011 the 296,460 German police officers fired a grand total of 85 shots. 49 warning shots, 36 aimed shots at people resulting in 6 killed and 11 injured. For comparison, in a single incident in LA 90 shots were fired at an unarmed man.",

I've only recently switched to Democrats because the Republicans are constantly saying very stupid, irresponsible, and quite frankly dangerous things. I even tried to stay neutral during the Capitol Riots and write it off as that perhaps they were misled but then they started shooting up things and sending bomb threats to anyone that they disagreed with. The Republicans made it impossible for me to remain neutral. I was metaphorically sitting comfortably on a very high ledge until the Republicans raised the water above my head. I can either swim for a sinking life raft with the Republicans or swim for the shore during a storm with the Democrats. Believe me I wish I could have stayed neutral and ride this out but it's simply impossible now.",

Obviously the Democratic party isn't full of Saints and they have an agenda that they're looking to push that benefits them, but comparing their \"evil\" to the GOP's is like saying stealing a candy bar and shooting someone in the face are the same because they're both crimes.  \n\n\nAt this point not taking a side is just as bad as voting for the Republicans. And that's their whole strategy, it always has been. The more they can disenfranchise people who are on the fence, the less likely those people are to vote at all. It's why you never hear them talking about their game plan to *actually* make America great (again), they just like to go on and on about the libs destroying democracy and freedom. All they can do is talk shit to make their shit look less bad by comparison.",

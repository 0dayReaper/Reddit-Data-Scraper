They can still get up and get all their shit finished and then still have the rest of their day. The difference is that morning people decided that the day ends much sooner, which is the only reason it feels like there isn't as much time to do shit if you wake up later.\n\nThat's literally the whole point of the post.\n\nIf you wake up at 5am and get all your shit done before 7 so you have the rest of the day to do what you want... You're gonna be tired much earlier which means you don't actually get more time. You just do shit earlier.\n\nAs a non-morning person, I've been having this thought since I was a kid/teen. My dad would give me so much shit for sleeping in instead of getting up and being productive... Meanwhile he was falling asleep on the couch every day at 6pm and I was up for several more hours. \n\nThere's nothing inherently more productive about getting up earlier, except for the fact that \"normal business hours\" are built for morning people.",

Most of my work happens in the evenings, but the time management issues associated with being ADHD makes it hard to run errands before work. However, when most of those places closed before my work would end, it made it harder to get those errands run at all.\n\nCovid made a lot of our stuff shut down earlier too. 24 hour is virtually gone. Even the fast food places are closing at 10 or 11 now, which means that when I'm working late, I usually can't grab something on the way home anymore.\n\nI was already not a morning person, but the way the world's response to Covid was to cut hours down to exclusively cater to those on 9-5 operating hours has been awful. I completely understand the need to reduce hours... I just wish they'd shift them a few hours (3, 6 or 12 lol).",

The problem however is how the ticket system worked and we had a monthly quota.  It was more likely that there would be an outage, and therefore a shit load of tickets, around 6-7am as the stores opened and realized a system or app was down.  \n\nSo the morning people ate up all the easy as fuck tickets, and by the time I logged in it was nothing but shit nobody wanted to touch.\n\nAn outage could easily contain 15-20 children tickets, and most of the morning outages were something simple like a hung database or a failed service that just needed to be stopped and started again.  BAM, 2 days worth of tickets for Frank and I'm still in bed.",

Drag queens, unacceptable.  Then explain to me why Florida has a kid friendly nudist beach!Let me understand this, okay? He's got a problem with men who dress in drag around children.  But he's totally fine with a man being totally naked around a child. Please, please make it make sense for me. I'm not trying to hate on adults who enjoy a nude beach, but your guy gotta explain this shit to me",

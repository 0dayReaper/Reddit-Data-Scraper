Liberal leaning towns do great with younger generations because they dont shit on them over literally everything. Why move back to/stay in a community that thinks less of you because you're queer/an ally/pro choice/a racial minority/not hyperreligious/think or do anything that challenges conservative dogma? Conservatives love ripping on \"cancel culture\" but the second you dont virtue signal your \"piety\" enough you become a social pariah in many of those communities.\n\nI noticed it myself in my own country. I lived on the edge of the bible belt so some towns were hyperreligious while 3km away they dont give a shit if you are. If you cycled through one of those towns on a sunday almost everyone who saw you would look at you as if you just pissed on their mother's grave. It was not a very inviting experience and i can see why young people look to escape those places at all costs. The only person i know to have voluntarily moved back was someone i could only describe as a hyperreligious nutcase, so he fit right in there.",

A lot of grumbling one has about 'kids these days' is that they're literally kids, these days. They are learning all this shit for the first time, and to someone who's been sheltered from it, the real world is kind of a bummer if you ask me. \n\nThey're going through it for the first time, they've got few coping mechanism developed yet, and this is the result of them trying to figure they way through life in a debbie downer world. \n\nThey'll grow out of it, and their hearts are in the right place.

Her hair came in rather late, so when she was ~2, she was bald and often dressed in blue or green, and everyone thought she was a boy.  We taught her to swim, ski (alpine), sing, dance, draw, do gymnastics, etc.  As soon as she could express her interests, we\u2019ve done our best to help her explore those.  She how has long blonde hair, she's in love with everything pink, dresses like a Princess whenever she can, sings along with every Disney movie she can, but now also seems to love baseball, playing in the sand box, riding bikes, and so on (she also seems to like skiing, and swimming too).  We\u2019re fine with her making her choices, we were just worried that we\u2019d make her into the default \u201cgirl\u201d but it turns out she likes some aspects of that all by herself, and we\u2019re happy to let her explore that.  I hope we can continue to run it that way, in that we might point her in the direction we want her to go, but ultimately leave the choice up to her as much as we can.  If she wants to dye her hair blue, I may not like it, but I\u2019ll help her do it if she asks me to.",

If you do some digging you can find alllll sorts of stories of children being estranged from their garbage republican family members due to the... you know shitty things they say and do. Sometimes they're even willing to give up the dirt, with actual evidence of just how fucking shitty their parents are. Most recent one in particular that was pretty significant (that I can remember anyway) was a daughter of a GOP strategist who basically designed the entirety of the GOP's gerrymandering plan and ways to push legal boundaries to do it. What/when to do things based on how SCOTUS rules on things. Put all of that on a computer and the daughter turned it over for the world to see. \n\nIt sucks ted cruz's daughter sought suicide. I genuinely hope she can get through this and arrive in a much better place in life. Hopefully far far FAR away from her pathetic and spineless lizard person of a father.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/01/05/785672201/deceased-gop-strategists-daughter-makes-files-public-that-republicans-wanted-sea story of the daughter mentioned",

It's his fault for putting his daughter's out there like human shields, using them as political pawns with zero regard for how it will affect them. I do not blame the crowd for booing because Ted Cruz deserves to be booed. I blame Ted Cruz for putting his daughters in that situation with no regard for how it will affect them emotionally and just completely using his family for political gain. \n\nTldr: Ted Cruz's giant piece of shit",

An intrusive, unstoppable thought that can happen every 5 minutes or less for every waking hour.\n\nNot only do you have to deal with the traumas that have led you to being suicidal, but you must now also be burdened with new trauma of living with suicidal thoughts and intent, and the impact it has on your relationships.",

But you're right, being suicidal is a form of trauma. Especially being suicidal while your brain is developing. It literally changes the physical neural pathways in your brain. And an attempt is also a form of trauma. One of my attempts still impacts me today because of the mental and physical trauma it caused even though it was years ago. To deal with all of that at 14 with the whole country watching... my heart hurts for her. I pray she gets the privacy she deserves right now but I unfortunately don't expect the media to give her that",

And she did mention she was bisexual in a comment thread.\n\nSo the information was there for people to find. However, it also appears she didn't intend for the information to spread (for example, she mentions she hadn't told her father yet).\n\nI'm not sure if this means she was outed or not. But it's definitely true that the news of her sexuality was spread without her knowledge. And, most importantly, by people doing so entirely to make a political point (on both sides of the isle), which is pretty disgusting.",

As in is it the intent or the result of the action that matters in a situation like this?\n\nAdditionally, reducing someone to a single aspect of their personality or physicality while being apathetic to the rest of the person can still be harmful to that person. It basically makes the statement that they're of no use beyond your personal urges. \n\nMaybe the hatred you get isn't because people aren't as intelligent as you think you are, but maybe because you aren't as thoughtful of others.",

Don't know if that's the case with you, but it really isn't that hard to not offend people. If you find it difficult and you actually care what people think then take some time to work on yourself. If you don't care what people think then tell them to fuck off and carry on.

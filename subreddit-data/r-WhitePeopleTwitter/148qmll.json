It's fucked here\n\nSuch a sizable amount of people believe in protecting the interests of the wealthy that even many Democrats don't dare do anything that would draw the ire of these voters. It would take many years of people continuing to vote less and less for Republicans until the Democratic Party felt comfortable enough with the position they held to do anything to fix this.

Fakes his outrage about how because of these exchanges parents have to explain this to their kids. \n\nWhat fuckin parents aren't already having talks with their kids about not using drugs? It's the same shit with sex though. They will always say that there shouldn't be sex-education in school because parents should be the sole authority on sex to their kids. That's just bullshit though because in truth a lot of conservative parents don't want to talk about sex at all or drugs. They are so offended by the thought. \n\nIt's crazy because beyond the obvious health benefits of needle exchanges and sex education, there are many parents who can't be relied on to teach their kids because they are absent or neglectful. \n\nIt's the same shit with child labor too. Acting as if parents should have the sole authority there just ignores that parents used to have kids just to put them to work! Which is abuse if you ask me.\n\nThese people are idealists. A lot of parents can't be relied on to do the right thing. The problem is their ideals are akin to the 1940s only with a lot less taxes on the rich. Get rid of abortion, no fault divorce, put the kids back to work, bring back acceptable child abuse. \n\nPeople need to wake up! Their ideals for America are to literally make our lives harder. Like they used to be! They want societal regression. They want a subservient middle working class with 80 hour work weeks and barely enough money to put food on the table. Pop out as many kids as you can so they can go to work and help support the family. If you think that sounds fun keep voting for the GOP. If you don't though please go vote for Democrats.

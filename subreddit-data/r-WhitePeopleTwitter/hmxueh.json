They can be like math functions where you pass them some values that they work with, and they return a result.\n\n\"f(x) = x^(2)\" is a (math-style) function.\n\nf(2) should return 4.\n\nOver the last decade or two lots of different programming languages have been updated with a newfangled thing called \"lambda expressions\" which is like a function, but it has no name, and you can declare it within another function. Usually, you put it into a variable or pass it into a regular function. Even as a programmer, it's... a little weird to think about treating functions like variables and passing functions into other functions.\n\nAnyway, once you've written your program, you usually have to compile it (which translates your human-readable code into machine code that the computer can execute).\n\nIn this case, I'm referring to the compiler known as \"GCC\", and the language \"C++\".\n\nUsing the command-line flag \"-std=gnu++17\" when executing GCC tells the compiler that you're specifically using the 2017 version of C++.\n\nI hope that's enough detail without being condescending.",

They asked him something related to Brexit or Covid or whatever, and he just responded with something along the lines of \"I'm a football coach, I can tell you about football. I don't know anything more than you about this, and my opinion on it doesn't make any difference - ask people who know about the subject\".\n\nPerfectly precise, perfectly German.",

                    "comment": "It is weird how selective the distrust of the government is though. They distrust science because it is government/corporate funded, but they trust governers who go against scientists for the benefit of corporations. \n\nThey feel scientists have some agenda targeting religion or somehow in a conspiracy with an evil doctor who will be the only one to benefit from the weird science discovery.  \n\nOn the flip side pretty much everyone on both sides is fully aware that government accepts bribes and benefits to make decisions that benefit huge corporations and billionaires while sacrificing the lives of everyone else - and they trust and support this process even though they are working poor who will never see a penny of extra money from the obvious corruption. \n\nMost Americans know that scientists are good people trying to help make the world better.\nThey also know that most huge corporations are making the wealthy richer while scamming money from the poor, and would rather poison a billion people than spend $5 doing something a cleaner way. \nActual scientists make very little money from their research, particularly compared to the corporate CEO's. They just research for the reward of discovering something new, or to help the world. \n\nBut somehow they would trust an industry that is obviously stealing from us while also killing us, because they give a few of us minimum wage jobs. \n\nListening to scientists means we need to change, and resistance to change is the real challenge.",

Ontario [does](https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19) and is closing in on 1.6 million tests (over 10%).\n\nThe only reported data I can find for Kansas was near the end of April when they had tested about 16,000 -- but that's two months ago.\n\nWhy do Ontario's death*** rates look different/worse?\n\nCould be the methodology/which deaths they determine to be because of COVID-19. It's also worth noting that Central Canada (i.e. Ontario and Quebec) have had severe outbreaks in *nursing homes specifically*, which is an intensely vulnerable population for this kind of thing.\n\nBy the end of May, before Canada's numbers started looking better across the board, [82% of Canada's COVID-19 related deaths](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/05/07/82-of-canadas-covid-19-deaths-have-been-in-long-term-care.html) were confined to long term care homes for the elderly (EDIT: For anyone curious, as I was, this means that Ontario had 3,436 deaths in Ontario care homes in May, compared with 50 reported deaths at Kansas care homes by June).\n\nThe median age of Ontario is nearly 4 years higher than that of Kansas, which doesn't look that much older on paper, but it actually does imply a huge number of excess elderly when you compare their population curves.\n\n***Edit",

This doesn't mean other countries couldn't be in a much better position by replicating New Zealand's response though.",

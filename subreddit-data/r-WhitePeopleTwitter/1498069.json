(Childhood abuse being notorious for producing \"black and white\" thinking); and\n\n- Repressed sexuality. \n\nOne of the founders of more body focused work in the West wrote an entire book on the idea that fascism crushes the connection to the body, and especially sexuality, and then channels the resulting primal rage at its enemies. You first make people ignore their bodies so you can define their feelings for them, then you direct their pent up rage elsewhere. The fascist dictator is the strong daddy figure they were abused by in childhood.",

He will not get the credit he deserves until the historians have written it all out many years from now. BrandoD will quietly continue to do the job he was elected to do, without flinching or failing despite all odds against him. If he makes a mistake, he\u2019ll own it. If he makes a massive success, he\u2019ll congratulate the people that supported him and worked tirelessly for the good of the country. There\u2019s such a huge difference.",

There's definitely no love lost between the two of them, trump is an extreme narcissist and is capable of only loving himself who married her for his own ends and she's either a gold-digger who used him to get citizenship for her and her family and wants his money, a foreign asset (likely Russian) acting as his handler, or it's a bit of both.\n\nWe are, in theory, a nation built on laws and where no one is above the law so it's good to see someone who has blatantly broken laws for years and years with no actual consequences facing at least some consequences now. It shouldn't have taken highly classified documents being stolen, sold, shown to people without any sort of clearance, etc. endangering members of our military and agents of our intelligence agencies for him to face consequences but I'm glad it's finally happening.",

Unfortunately regardless of gender time or place this is an example of the TikTok attitude which will only put the cause back. I realise this may get lionised and downvoted but it comes from a place of worry for the escalating situation in your country. I get that there is leaning towards protest and I completely understand but there are ways to go about it that do not add fuel to an already raging inferno.

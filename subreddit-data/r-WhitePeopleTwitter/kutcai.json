I just saw a failed attempt to stop the incoming mob by a single man who could obviously not do much, but in fact it was an insanely smart strategy. You can see at one point when he turns a corner the first guy pushing looks down another hall wondering where he should go but ultimately follows the Mr Goodman. Amazing job!\n\nETA I just realized that moment is highlighted in this article and that is actually the point where they turn away from the senate chamber just a few feet away. Man, that was a ballsy bluff. Truly remarkable.\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/capitol-riot-trump-mob-officer-video-senate-chambers-b1785150.html",

He never refused their aid. \n\nWe need to be critical of those that failed us, but we need to be careful we are finding who actually held the blame for a failure in security and not just whoever is convenient to point at.

After a program called \"warrior training\" was removed from the training curriculum here for being too dangerous, the police union head (involved in 3 shootings, 20 complaints and several lawsuits, fuck bob kroll) actually raised money to pay for officers to go through the program in their spare time. So there's definitely a disconnect between the often good training cops receive and what some choose to do instead.",

That's beyond badass.\n\n\nI believe in a change in police policies. I've experienced some awful things from police (and I'm a white woman, I can only imagine how awful it is for others)\n\n\nBut holy fuck! That man is a hero! If he was the ones training officers around the country instead of Dave fucking Grossman (and, OMG, can we have a moment to appreciate the dichotomy of their names &amp; actions?) We'd be better off.\n\n\nThat man is a fucking hero, not just because he did the right thing, but he did it in a brilliant way. He knew that, whatever they said, they'd target him. He risked his life to set up an ambush. Bravo!!!! Brave AF and clever! I wish he was the role model for all officers!",

Many of these people actually thought they were in their right to do this. The guy getting informed he's in the no-fly list and breaking down crying because he's realized that he's fucked up for real shows that they don't actually think about the consequences of what they participated in.\n\nWith that said, given enough of an excuse, I bet gunfire would have been drawn. Somehow it didn't happen, and I assume it was more than just luck, but definitely a lot of luck, that it did not.\n\nThe \"you're treating me like a black guy\" dude from one year ago was all insight we needed at their world view and mental gymnastics.",

Don\u2019t rely on my take.\n\nEdit 2: compare for yourself here is when Babbit is shot. https://www.nbcnews.com/video/capitol-shooting-that-led-to-ashli-babbitt-s-death-captured-on-video-99180613572\nI think they are the same room. I was confused because the video with all the legislators seemed like a big space while in the Babbit video it looks like a narrow hallway. Note though that the barricades and pictures look the same. And I think I see one of the same police officers in both videos? Seems like they somehow got moved off of their position in front of the door",

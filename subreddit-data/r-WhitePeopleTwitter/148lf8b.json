I've no arguments with any on that list in 2028, but for now I'll stick with the long-time operator who can navigate the bullshit that we have in office. A bird in hand, and all that.\n\nConscientious Americans need to do the grunt work of contesting EVERY election - not just the Hollywood glam of the Presidency, but the nitty-gritty of state and local. The courts, the legislatures, and the school boards may be stacked against us, but that ain't an inevitability, even in an imperfect system. The political indifference of sensible Americans plus the sheer pettiness of the whackadoodle Right got us here, where even the dog catchers in some places are ideologues. We need to scratch back our country with each and every vote so a young, progressive President might actually get us somewhere.\n\nMeantime, let the Boomers have their last hurrah. No sense letting them off the hook, either; this is their mess after all. Besides, Biden ain't half bad for a guy born in the '40s. If he wants to be the Second Coming of FDR, I'm not going to argue after all the shit we've endured since the First. Right now, we need his blandness to keep \"the independents\" onside and his tactical savvy to keep legislative hope alive. Why are folk in such a rush to throw away a good thing?",

Everyone calling for the successful incumbent President to be primaried is proclaiming their political ignorance. It would all but insure a Republican victory.

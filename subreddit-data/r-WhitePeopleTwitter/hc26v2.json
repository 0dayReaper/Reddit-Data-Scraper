(It just coincidentally coincides with right wing media and beliefs ^[not ^political ^though] )\n\nThere's one guy in particular, who has been making the rounds of [right-wing media](https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/alex-berenson) since at least early March that seems to be the leading voice behind a lot of this country's stupidity, but I feel the insular nature of today's politics makes it to where much of Reddit doesn't even know he exists. He's been ridiculing masks quite a bit. Never in a way that makes it seem as though he's 100% against them, conveniently enough for him, but enough that all of his \"followers\" seem to actively deride masks.\n\nHe's a former NYT (because he makes sure to mention it) columnist who has been making a living as a novelist, a [marijuana alarmist](https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Your-Children-Marijuana-Violence/dp/1982103671/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=alex+berenson&amp;qid=1592520365&amp;sr=8-2), and most recently a [Covid truther](https://www.amazon.com/Unreported-Truths-about-COVID-19-Lockdowns-ebook/dp/B089P216NP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=alex+berenson&amp;qid=1592520133&amp;sr=8-1). His \"book\" here is currently #8 on Amazon's top sellers list. His name is Alex Berenson, and his Twitter feed is filled with the most cherry-picked, strawman-filled, pseudo-scientific bullshit I've seen, and it frankly pisses me off. Not only because he is wrong, but because right-leaning dipshits seem to have latched onto him.\n\nWhen he isn't mocking those who are wearing masks, he is grasping onto any Covid model or prediction he can find to say that it's all overblown hysteria. He mocks what he calls the \"Department of Pandemia,\" and the \"Karens\" that fall for the \"alarmism\" surrounding Covid. The egregious misuse of the Karen meme is bad enough.\n\nIMO he's a dangerous propagandist and has or will be responsible for much suffering in this country when all of this is said and done.",

If we don\u2019t clean up our act and the scientists were right, catastrophe.\n\nEdit: Apparently some of you took the Prius thing literally. It\u2019s just a placeholder in this argument for \u201cbeing greener.\u201d I thought that was obvious. Also, arguing that being green hurts the economy ignores 1) potential health benefits of a greener earth 2) your pushing short term gain over long term viability and 3) you\u2019re assuming going green can\u2019t help the economy (which it could say via new tech, new job markets, new IP, etc.)",

You're thinking of modern libertarians who co-opted the term, the same kind of dregs who fly the don't tread on me flag next to the thin blue line flag. Real libertarianism is far, far away from fascism.\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n\"Left-libertatianism\u00a0ideologies include\u00a0anarchist schools of thought, alongside many other anti-paternalist,\u00a0New Left\u00a0schools of thought\u00a0centered around\u00a0economic egalitarianism\u00a0as well as\u00a0geolibertarianism,\u00a0green politics,\u00a0market-oriented left-libertarianism\u00a0and the\u00a0Steiner\u2013Vallentyne school. In the mid-20th century,\u00a0right-libertarian\u00a0ideologies such as\u00a0anarcho-capitalism\u00a0and\u00a0minarchism\u00a0co-opted\u00a0the term\u00a0libertarian\u00a0to advocate\u00a0laissez-faire\u00a0capitalism\u00a0and strong\u00a0private property rights\u00a0such as in land, infrastructure and natural resources.\u00a0The latter is the dominant form of\u00a0libertarianism in the United States, where it advocates\u00a0civil liberties,\u00a0natural law,\u00a0free-market capitalism\u00a0and a major reversal of the modern\u00a0welfare state.\"\n\nAnarcho-capitalism is basically highly specialized cooperative feudalism. Tiny monarchs in their tiny kingdoms, where the strong stay strong as long as they can keep their power / money, and the weak are constantly trampled underfoot, but with the illusion in place that by enough hard work, one day you could be one of the strong.",

Safety checks are primarily why you see everyone wearing helmets, at least in my company. People would walk through sites randomly to check eye, head etc. gear were being worn properly. I don't know what the punishment was but it didn't take long on the job to hear them talk about this safety inspector and make sure I was following guidelines if I was on site. If those inspections never happened and no one cared what people did with their PPE there would have been a lot more people not wearing helmets, for some reason.",

Droplet size changes, and we can stop droplets and virus from getting out better than we can stop smaller droplets from getting in. The virus size doesn't change, but the droplet size does. There is a viral goldilocks style droplet that both prevents dessication/drying out while also not falling to the ground from gravity.\n\nIn other words - wear the damn mask.",

He has had way more funding from other wealthy conservatives long before Musk got involved, just like Steven Crowder.",

It will become more difficult to discern what we can and cannot trust.\n\nTim Pool is a pretty obvious candidate for \u201cdo not trust this man.\u201d\n\nThe frustrating thing with deepfakes is that the mere existence of them gives the right the excuse to distrust anything they dislike. And they will blatantly be biased in how they apply that logic. They\u2019ll believe the most clear examples of deepfakes that confirm their beliefs and act incredulous if you call them out on it.",

They hired something like 25 people for their grocery department.  This was during the pandemic because grocery departments were fucking dying.  Of course lab testing was super slow so people were just brought on and drug testing was sent off, with results TBD.  Only like three people passed so two to three weeks after all these people started, twenty-two people were fired because of failed drug tests.  Failed drug tests to be grocery stock clerks.  Like who in the fuck do they think is going to work that job?",

The IRA is dope and a buddy of mine working in renewables said it\u2019s so big that anyone who says they understand how much it will do is being reductionist. \n\n2. The largest infrastructure act since the freaking interstate system was built. We\u2019re talking money for raids, rail, ports, airports, internet, and water infrastructure that the country desperately needs. Look at how DOT is dolling out the money too, it\u2019s clear they want municipalities to consider not just cars anymore. \n\n3) Medicare can negotiate drug prices. That is fucking massive and will help so many seniors. \n\n4) insulting price cap for people on Medicare. \n\n5) A corporate minimum tax. \n\n6) Student loan forgiveness from 10-20k. Something like half to 60% of all borrowers are good after this. Not to mention, Biden also capped the minimum required payment and made it so if you pay that you\u2019re interest does not go up. \n\n7) Literally the best industrial policy I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. Between CHIPs and IRA I\u2019ve seen at least a dozen headlines of companies announcing they\u2019re building factories in the IS or moving up completion of existing projects. \n\n8) The sciences funding in CHIPs is also insane. We finally have a translation lab!!\n\n9) the first gun control in my lifetime. \n\n10) a bill to finally take care of burn pit victims. \n\n11) So much more than I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head.\n\nEdit: A word.",

                                    "comment": "1.  \"First major climate action in US history\"  Not even close.  The Clinton Administration introduced the Climate Change Action Plan that was far more that what Biden introduced.  Obama's New Energy for America plan was a huge investment in renewables with the focus on replacing coal/oil with renewable energy.  I've read the Biden plan.  It's almost completely studies.  Millions and millions of dollars for studies, with NOTHING (that I could find) of actual doing anything.\n2. Infrastructure bill:  Yeah, this is a huge win for all of us, and something that the man who wrote \"Art of the Deal\" could never make happen, despite his campaign promise.\n3. (1?) Medicare can negotiate drug prices.  Maybe.  What passed is that Medicare can negotiate prices for 10 drugs, but those prices won't go into effect until 2026, which is plenty of time for it to be reversed.  I'll believe it when I see it happen.\n4. (2?) Insulin price cap:  This is a huge win.  Insulin costs about $3 to make and will be capped at $35 starting next year.  Going prices were above $300 in some cases.  This looks like it will definitely happen, so great job!\n5. (3) A corporate minimum tax:  It only affects companies worth over $1B, and only those currently paying below the 15% threshold, so just 127 companies.  Still, these are some huge companies that have avoided lots of taxes.  It's a start, but ignores most tax cheats.\n6. (4)  Student loan forgiveness has passed, but still has not gone into effect, and Biden has already rolled back his promise to include private loans.  You have to apply for forgiveness and it remains to be seen how many will be granted forgiveness.  Remember Trump had a forgiveness policy too, but actually 98% of applications were summarily rejected.  For Biden's plan, we have to wait until October 17th.  Of course, that's not Biden's fault.  It's due to Republican lawsuits, but let's not give credit for something that might not even happen.\n7. (5)  I don't know what Biden's overall industrial policy is because I can't find anywhere that he talks about it.  The Chips Act is designed to bring chip design and tech back to the US after China started upping the threats against Taiwan (where we get nearly all of our chips currently).  Despite the motivation, this act has passed and is a great start to (ironically) making America great again.  This is a fantastic win for the US.\n8. (6) (same as 7 above)\n9. \"the first gun control in my lifetime\".  I don't know how old you are, but Obama signed an EO requiring background checks on all gun purchases.  And in 2019 Congress passed the \"Bipartisan Background Checks Act\" which basically codified Obama's EO, plus closed some loopholes.  Biden's bill hardly does anything.  It makes \"tougher\" background checks for buyers under 21 years old, which means nothing since background checks are already required.  It provides money for mental health which does nearly nothing directly against gun violence.  And it \"encourages\" states to take away guns from people considered a threat, whatever the hell that means.  All in all, it does nothing for gun control.\n10. Burn pit victims: Yeah, this helps 3.5 million veterans, which is awesome.\n11. More:  He put an end to federal executions, which Trump had lifted, allowing him (tfg) to execute 13 people (including 3 in January 2021 right before Biden took office on Jan. 20th).    \n\\- He's appointed 73 Federal Judges, although how liberal these judges are remains to be seen.  At least it's better than the losers Trump was appointing.  \n\\- Spent 1.9T in COVID relief.  And it looks like most of that actually went to help people (unlike the PPP program).  \n\\- The real unemployment rate is down to 6.7%, which is actually the lowest since before Clinton (the chart I saw only went to 1994). So, this is a real win for the American people, and we are seeing a lot of progress in terms of workers rights because of it.  \n\\- Despite the pretty stupid way he did it, he did finally put an end to Afghan war.\n\nWhat he HASN'T DONE:\n\n1. No Universal healthcare  \n\n2. No raise in Federal minimum wage  \n\n3. No reduction in the Trillion $ we spend per year in \"defense\"\n4. Remove the cap on Social Security contributions, which would save SS forever.\n5. Fix the ridiculous cost of hospital care, and remove medical debt (part of #1, but could be a half-step)\n6. Get the money out of politics and fix our election (admittedly an impossible task)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate\\_change\\_policy\\_of\\_the\\_United\\_States#Clinton\\_administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_policy_of_the_United_States#Clinton_administration)  \n[https://news.bloombergtax.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/a-15-minimum-corporate-tax-is-no-economic-villain-nir-kaissar](https://news.bloombergtax.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/a-15-minimum-corporate-tax-is-no-economic-villain-nir-kaissar)  \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61938109",

I couldn't be anything but honest. He had been a Republican his whole life but he never flew a single political flag. Now he has twenty Trump flags in his yard and will not talk politics with anybody except people like him. I miss my friend because we could talk politics and we were both enthusiastic about it. I feel like the reason for this is he knows he is wrong and can't argue in good faith about Trump.",

Because on average their fairly conservative, just not *off their rocker* crazy. It's just that the GOP has shifted that far out to right field that it's in the back of the parking lot and mad that they're not still on the field... And with enough media Influence to convince people otherwise.\n\nI have family in that zoo. And while you can convince them of reasonable ideas and what they want from politicians they will flip their lid the second you point out its a democratic policy they actually want, because they genuinly believe as their told that only the GOP cares for them and their rights and they're \"under attack\" by baby eating pedofile democrats. :/\n\nWe only have a few truly left leaning politicians in higher Goverment. Who push for crazy radical ideas like..*gasp*, Everybody should be able to afford Healthcare.\n\nWe need ranked choice voting options.. And we need less bat shit crazy political figures running for office. Yet we can't seem to enact and enforce any political standards because \"it would be biased and unfair to one specific political party to have basic civil standards\"",

Here's the link to one such list. Notice how almost all of them \"came out\" after their last term in office or lost reelections agree coming out as one.

Politicians simply work for the vote in other places vs just fundraising hundreds of millions of $$.\n\nI hope the DNC learns something from this, and I especially hope that democrats turn out enough to stop the GOP from taking the Senate at least. \n\nIf we turn out the vote enough and win, we can *maybe* expect a future of center-right politicians like Biden actually listening to the left for the first time in my lifetime.\n\nIf we don't turn out and win, this may end up as a failed beta test and we will never get regular \"earn the vote\" politics.",

Even if that were true\u2014and it fucking isn\u2019t, by the way\u2014I\u2019m still going to very much prefer the side that\u2019s pretending to want to help me, because at least then they\u2019ll still throw me a bone sometimes just to keep up appearances. Which is a hell of a lot more than the side that openly and loudly hates and despises me for no more reason than that they\u2019re hateful bigots.\n\nRemember, folks: Both Sides is a lazy and obfuscating position. It\u2019s admitting the person claiming it can\u2019t be bothered to understand the difference between 4x2 and 4+2. As far as they can be bothered to observe, they\u2019re both a 4 and a 2 with a cross between them. And maybe 8 and 6 aren\u2019t all *that* far apart in the grand scheme of things, but when the cut-off for violently-stupid regressive bigots is 7, then those two things are very different indeed, and arguing their equivalence is making excuses for violently-stupid regressive bigots. 8/10 is okay but could be better. 6/10 is one step away from outright failure.",

They build their whole worldview on hatred of The Other. It\u2019s not just a mild dislike, it\u2019s a *hatred,* and that can\u2019t be reasoned with. Moreover many on the right are of the Religious Zealot bent who are convinced they have God on their side and the Democrats are actually completely evil. They\u2019re not going to be convinced to \u201ccompromise\u201d when they think they are irrefutably totally correct and their opponents are agents of the devil. At that point, \u201ccompromising\u201d in their eyes would be giving ground to the evil. Politics is about compromise, but the Republican Party in America isn\u2019t practicing politics anymore, and anyone still not paying enough attention to realize that is doing more harm than good when they whine about \u201ccompromise.\u201d",

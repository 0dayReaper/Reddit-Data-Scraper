Woman came in mid-November (in New Hampshire mind you) and was selling homemade Thanksgiving table decor.  You know like that thing you put in the middle of the table that looks nice.  She very politely asked permission to sell them in the parking lot of the store, so that she could raise money for her family's Thanksgiving.  Of course we let her do it. Anyway, after a long day in the frigid weather of selling these things, she came in and spend every dollar and dime on scratch offs.  She won $0.  It was.... tragic.",

And these gamblers man, they're so addicted. They know they won't win - or at the least they acknowledge their chances are so bad, but the sunken cost fallacy runs deep in them. Like you said, have regulars that can only afford to spend $5 at a time that they gained either by panhandling or from something they've pawned. You just see some low brow shit living in rural America. Depressing for sure",

Those who receive the new money first receive it before prices have yet risen. They enjoy a windfall. Meanwhile, as they spend the new money, and the next wave of recipients spend it, and so on, prices begin to rise throughout the economy--well before the new money has trickled down to most people. The average person is now paying higher prices while still earning his old income, which has not yet been adjusted to account for the higher money supply. By the time the new money has made its way throughout the economy, average people have all this time been paying higher prices, and only now can begin to break even.",

The current crop of power brokers, and the young boomer/white uneducated gen-x voters, came of age when Reagan simultaneously \"defeated\" the commies while cutting taxes. So now they only view cutting taxes and suckling the teat of corporations as the correct economic policy. And there are lobbying groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce funded by billionaires dedicated to maintaining this economic Kayfabe. But the growth came from the busting of unions, outsourcing, stock-buy backs due to a Reagan policy change.",

A middle class family ranging around 120k to 250k for a family of 4 depending on your state.\n\nThose numbers are so varied because some cities you can live quite comfortably on 35k as a single person, but you\u2019re still not considered middle class by the nations average. \n\nOverall I think the median ranges are terribly irresponsible to factor what is lower, middle and upper class. My best definitions are simply this. As a lower class individual, could you comfortably purchase an item worth $1,500 with liquid cash? At middle class, could you easily purchase a $5,000 item with liquid cash? Upper class, could you easily purchase a $15,000 item with liquid cash? If you can answer yes to those totals all the way up, congratulations you\u2019re better off than 98% of the US. Nearly 70% of Americans can\u2019t handle a $1000 emergency purchase with liquid cash.",

Ask anyone what they would prefer: make a decent living and support yourself or live off government assistance. I don\u2019t know a single person who prefers the latter.

            "comment": "I\u2019ve posted this before, but it\u2019s important to lay out some of the details.\n\nThis is a general overview of Biden\u2019s proposed tax plan:\n\n&gt;\tBiden says no individual with taxable income of $400,000 or less would see a federal tax increase under his plans, at least directly. Less than than 2% of U.S. households report that level of income. There are several policy provisions tied up in Biden\u2019s promise, but income tax rates often get the most attention.\n\n&gt;\tThere are currently seven rates (10% to 37%) applied to varying income brackets. Biden\u2019s plan would raise only the top rate, pushing it to 39.6%, what it was before the Republicans\u2019 2017 overhaul. That rate kicks in for income beyond $510,000 or so, and more for married couples filing jointly. Separately, Biden proposes capping certain itemized deductions for higher earners. Those changes could mean variable tax increases for individuals down to that $400,000 income threshold \u2014 more for married joint filers.\n\n&gt;\tThe existing 12.4% payroll tax, which is split between employers and workers and finances the Social Security program, applies only to the first $137,700 of a person\u2019s income. That cap goes up annually with inflation.\n\n&gt;\tBiden proposes instituting the tax again beginning at $400,001 of income. The untaxed gap between the cap and $400,001 would close over time with the annual inflationary increases. That would eventually mean a Social Security system where all wage earners, regardless of their income and profession, paid the full freight of payroll taxes.\n\n&gt;\tBiden applies a similar philosophy to investment income. Generally, current law taxes gains on long-term investments \u2014 those held for more than a year \u2014 and certain dividend income at capital gains rates that top out at 20%. That\u2019s lower than the marginal income tax rates for many in the investor class.\n\n&gt;\tGains on short-term holdings of less than a year are subject to personal income tax rates. Biden proposes extending that principle to all investment gains for any income beyond $1 million, a change that could significantly affect the wealthiest investor class.\n\n&gt;\tHe wants a 28% percent corporate tax rate. That\u2019s higher than the current 21% but lower than the 35% rate before the 2017 overhaul. President Barack Obama had pushed for a 28% rate but Republicans in Congress refused to negotiate.\n\n&gt;\tSeparately, Biden wants a 15% minimum tax on \u201cbook profits\u201d \u2013 net annual income \u2013 for corporations with at least $100 million in income.\n\n&gt;\tBiden wants to double the current 10.5% minimum tax that multinational corporations pay on foreign profits.\n\n&gt;\tTo the chagrin of some progressives, Biden opposes a tax based on individuals\u2019 net worth. He\u2019s also avoided rekindling debate over taxes imposed on heirs of large estates. Biden does want one estate tax change that could significantly affect wealthy inheritors and raise tens of billions in revenue each year.\n\n&gt;\tCurrently, beneficiaries can sell off assets they inherited and pay capital gains based only on any accrual between the time they gained ownership of the asset and the time they sold it. That basically exempts from taxation any gains accrued by the deceased owner. Biden proposes eliminating that inheritor benefit and instead applying capital gains taxes based on the original value of an asset.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/2e319858f049ddf25d975476455b7305\n\n\nThe Nation also has a concise [infograph on some of the bigger changes](https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Score-Biden-Tax-Plan_img.jpg). The source for that can be found here: https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/biden-tax-plan/tnamp/\n\nRight now, the American tax system is constructed to benefit the rich. Biden\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go as far as I would like, but it is a significant improvement. Even under our current tax syste, biased as it is, the IRS doesn\u2019t have the means to enforce it on the rich.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have deliberately dried out the IRS budget to the point that the agency itself admits it doesn\u2019t have the means to audit the rich, *even though doing so would bring a net profit*. Instead, they audit the working poor:\n\n&gt;\tIt\u2019s taken eight years to bring the agency that funds the government this low. Over time, the IRS has slowly transformed, one employee departure at a time.\n\n\n\n&gt;\tThe result is a bureaucracy on life support and tens of billions in lost government revenue. ProPublica estimates a toll of at least $18 billion every year, but the true cost could easily run tens of billions of dollars higher.\n\n\n\n&gt;\tThe cuts are depleting the staff members who help ensure that taxpayers pay what they owe. As of last year, the IRS had 9,510 auditors. That\u2019s down a third from 2010. The last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents was 1953, when the economy was a seventh of its current size. And the IRS is still shrinking. Almost a third of its remaining employees will be eligible to retire in the next year, and with morale plummeting, many of them will.\n\n\n&gt;\tThe IRS conducted 675,000 fewer audits in 2017 than it did in 2010, a drop in the audit rate of 42 percent. But even those stark numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, say current and former IRS employees: Auditors are stretched thin, and they\u2019re often forced to limit their investigations and move on to the next audit as quickly as they can.\n\n&gt;\tWithout enough staff, the IRS has slashed even basic functions. It has drastically pulled back from pursuing people who don\u2019t bother filing their tax returns. New investigations of \u201cnonfilers,\u201d as they\u2019re called, dropped from 2.4 million in 2011 to 362,000 last year. According to the inspector general for the IRS, the reduction results in at least $3 billion in lost revenue each year. Meanwhile, collections from people who do file but don\u2019t pay have plummeted. Tax obligations expire after 10 years if the IRS doesn\u2019t pursue them. Such expirations were relatively infrequent before the budget cuts began. In 2010, $482 million in tax debts lapsed. By 2017, according to internal IRS collection reports, that figure had risen to $8.3 billion, 17 times as much as in 2010. The IRS\u2019 ability to investigate criminals has atrophied as well.\n\n&gt;\t..\n\n&gt;\tFor the rich, who research shows evade taxes the most, the IRS has become less and less of a force to be feared.\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted\n\n&gt;\tThe IRS audits the working poor at about the same rate as the wealthiest 1%. Now, in response to questions from a U.S. senator, the IRS has acknowledged that\u2019s true but professes it can\u2019t change anything unless it is given more money.\n\n&gt;\t..\n\n&gt;\tOn the one hand, the IRS said, auditing poor taxpayers is a lot easier: The agency uses relatively low-level employees to audit returns for low-income taxpayers who claim the earned income tax credit. The audits \u2014 of which there were about 380,000 last year, accounting for 39% of the total the IRS conducted \u2014 are done by mail and don\u2019t take too much staff time, either. They are \u201cthe most efficient use of available IRS examination resources,\u201d Rettig\u2019s report says.\n\n&gt;\tOn the other hand, auditing the rich is hard. It takes senior auditors hours upon hours to complete an exam. What\u2019s more, the letter says, \u201cthe rate of attrition is significantly higher among these more experienced examiners.\u201d As a result, the budget cuts have hit this part of the IRS particularly hard.\n\n&gt;\t**For now, the IRS says, while it agrees auditing more wealthy taxpayers would be a good idea, without adequate funding there\u2019s nothing it can do. \u201cCongress must fund and the IRS must hire and train appropriate numbers of [auditors] to have appropriately balanced coverage across all income levels,\u201d the report said.**\n\n&gt;\t**Since 2011, Republicans in Congress have driven cuts to the IRS enforcement budget; it\u2019s more than a quarter lower than its 2010 level, adjusting for inflation.**\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/irs-sorry-but-its-just-easier-and-cheaper-to-audit-the-poor\n\nI would recommend checking out the books *The Triumph of Injustice* and *Perfectly Legal* for a more complete, readable analysis of how the US tax structures benefit those at the top, how the rich deliberately lobbied to create the system in place today, and potential ways to fix it. Both books give great insight into how someone like Trump can end up paying $750 in taxes, even without it being illegal (though jury is still out the legality of Trump\u2019s taxes).",

Below 50k there are slightly more Democrats. Between 50-200k there are slightly more Republicans. Above 200k it's fairly even. A lot of people making above 400k in \\*income\\* are working professionals in overwhelmingly Democratic cities like New York and San Francisco. \n\nSo the income levels of people opposed to this tax increase are probably pretty widely spread. If you had to pick a single income level for the peak opposition, it would probably be something like 75-100k - i.e. people who aren't actually affected by it but are against taxes in some abstract sense.",

I know way too many people who don't understand how a progressive tax works. I actually had a friend (who works as a software engineer and has a master's degree) ask me if she should refuse her raise because it would put her in the next tax bracket.",

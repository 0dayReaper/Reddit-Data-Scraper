                            "comment": "At least the mayor of Las Vegas was accidentally totally honest. After advocating for the casinos on the strip to reopen a few months back she was asked if that meant she would be fine going into one herself. Her answer was something to the effect of, \"Certainly not, I have a family.\"\n\nHer entire push to reopen Vegas was based on the free market dictating how safe they needed to be, instead of government guidelines or health rules. So if a casino wasn't making itself safe enough then everyone there would get sick, and the free market would shut it down. Because, you know how everyone goes to Vegas and ONLY goes to just one casino right?",

Additionally into their own elbow with mask would effectively stop most droplets. \n\nThis is why, mask or no mask, you stay 2 meters away from people outside your bubble.  Droplets into your eyes is a bad thing. \n\nYou can wash your hands, your clothes etc but flushing your eyes is a whole lot harder.  Also no normal flora in your eyes to stop something from taking root. \n\nTip: turn your back to people when they pass you or vice versa.  I love that it is now socially acceptable to turn my back on people.",

You don't need to be here, stay home. Of course, they never do because the same attitude that makes you think it's \"OK\" to come to work when you can't finish a sentence without having a coughing fit, is the same attitude that makes you think you *need* to be in the office.\n\nWe'll all be better off when this attitude dies.",

It's easy to say just have remote or online schooling; it's easy to say that I'm going to homeschool my child until all of this blows over. #1 remote learning is very difficult and it provides nowhere near the rigor or the learning opportunities that in school learning does. This is because we always need to provide education equity. We need to provide an educational experience that every student can do and not just some of the students or even most. Accountability is something that wanes very quickly in students when they don't have a presence, either teacher or parent, that tells them to keep doing their work. Also, A lot of people don't realize that some students and families don't have computers or don't have internet to even be able to access this remote learning which is its own fucked up problem. When we were doing remote learning at the end of the last school year, in May and June, everyone just wanted it to be done because hardly any learning was actually happening, we were just going through the motions. #2 many if not most families rely on in school learning simply as a form of daycare for their children. Parents need to work, where are they going to put their children all day every day? what if those children are 7, 8, 9 years old? Are they just going to be left home alone? what if they don't have grandparents or older siblings who can take care of them? What are the psychological effects on children who are stuck at home all day every day and don't see their friends. \n\nDon't act like this is an easy issue with an easy answer, it's anything but.",

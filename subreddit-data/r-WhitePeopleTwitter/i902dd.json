You\u2019d think that if there\u2019s one thing that could unite Americans, it\u2019s that Pedophiles suck, but apparently not.\n\nEdit: All these replies have showed is how many people just completely miss the entire fucking point. Pedophiles are bad regardless of their political party. Yes, Biden is a fucking creep and I wish that literally almost anyone else running had got the nomination but here we are. Trump is also a fucking creep, and he sucks, unfortunately with the way our political system works, we have to choose which creep is less worse. Pedophiles all suck people, I didn\u2019t think that many people needed this explained out to them, but I guess I had too much faith in people.",

Politics is working out how to keep people fed and alive during a pandemic. Politics is arguing about how to best address climate change. Politics is how to run the prison you keep your pedos in. \n\nThis stuff isn't \"left vs right\" or \"Democrats vs Republicans\". It's \"good vs evil\", \"wrong vs right\" and \"sensible vs stupid\". \n\nYet somehow the world is paralyzed because a percentage of the right wing has decided \"all in on evil, wrong and stupid please\" because some shithead on Fox News or Facebook told them to.",

I'll just block you. Just downvote me and move on. I'm all for open dialogue, but I'm done acknowledging unabashed racists. And don't tell me \"all lives matter\" isn't racist. It is in this context, and you know it is.\n\nEDIT: This is kind of nice. Some of the replies I'm getting are allowing me to easily weed out the proud racists so I never have to hear from them again on Reddit. They even give me a little entertainment by trying to convince me that they're not racist and that \"all lives matter\" isn't a direct racist response to BLM. They still go bye bye. Btw, I absolutely am racist as in I make subconscious unintentional snap judgements based on race thanks to societal conditioning. I'm trying my best to unlearn what I have learned.\n\nEDIT: There are 4 kinds of people in western society.\n\n1. Proud bigots. You know who you are. Nazi tattoos. Confederate flags. Hopefully you'll all die off eventually.\n\n2. People who try to convince themselves they're not racist. These people will say things like \"all lives matter\",  \"I don't see color\", and \"I have a black friend, he's actually nice\". These aren't necessarily intentionally bad people, but they're still racist. You'll get the most push back from these people trying to convince you they're not racist.\n\n3. People who admit they're racist but are trying their best to unlearn that behavior.\n\n4. People who aren't racist at all. They make absolutely no race based judgements, ever, for any race. They never have and they never will. These people are imaginary and don't exist.",

Then again, [sometimes they fetch you some Burger King](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article25394389.html) when you complain that you're hungry after having murdered 9 black people in a church.\n\nEdit: Getting a lot of hot takes like \"should they just let him starve?\" Of course not, but you know what? He's not going to starve in the amount of time it takes to question and book him. Then he could have his meal behind bars. Others are pointing out it's a common interrogation tactic to make it seem like you're their friend. Sure, there's some merit to that. But it still highlights a glaring dichotomy when unarmed, innocent black men (or teenagers, or younger) get murdered before any questioning can even take place, while a white supremacist murderer is not only taken without incident but gets to chow down on some Burger King.",

The problem is that most bigoted people got there by instinctually doubling down on whatever they learned first and going on the attack when confronted with anything that challenges what they already believe. Even when they themselves start realizing their own errors. That's why they so often deflect instead of staying on topic and defending their point. Once they hit a wall they don't even consider climbing over it, they just shift to another point and are convinced that that's how arguments work. Most of them believe they're correct not because they've thought through the position and it makes logical sense to them, but because they don't even realize that their response to new information is wrong. That's what needs to be solved before you can even begin to correct the beliefs themselves. \n\nThen you just have people who were taught by bigots and genuinely don't see the faults. Those people are much easier to reach if you can have a calm and deliberate conversation (which means definitely not online).",

Those needs should be met and they have the same right to human dignity as anyone else. I don't wish to deprive them of any of that simply because they disagree with me.\n\nThat's the crucial difference. Their capacity for empathy begins and ends with their in-group. The pure fact of the matter is that they do not believe everyone is equally entitled to the same basic needs, services, and social safety nets. They are livid when \"the wrong sort of people\" receive welfare benefits even if they depend on it as well. When Republican policies hurt other people, they cheer, but when those same policies hurt them, they whine about it. They complain about people sponging off of tax dollars, but on average, red states are a net drain on federal funds.\n\nThe simple truth is that if you do not believe every person is entitled to the same human rights as you, then you do not see them as human beings and that makes you a monster.

And to be also clear, the fact that Trump is in a picture with Epstein is not evidence, nor is Bill Clinton riding on a plane. That evidence puts them in contact with someone who committed a crime, but being with a criminal does not make one a criminal. \n\nIf Maxwell starts implicating people, that too might not be enough evidence, since she will surely have an inventive. \n\nSadly, this is hard. Brett fucking Kavanaugh is on the bench of the highest court in the land, and he was reasonably accused of a crime. Trump has been reasonably accused of rape (case is still going through courts). \n\nI know we want justice. But we also want a justice system that assumes you're innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n\nPlease note: this is not a defense of monsters. This is a note that if we stray from the rule of law, then we're just a crowd with pitchforks, and that never ends well.",

And that\u2019s the whole case so far against Clinton.  He was on the plane and at the island.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a case.\n\nSimilarly, all the pictures of Trump with Epstein or Ghislane aren\u2019t cases.  But given the speed with which some would like to crucify Clinton with next to no evidence, but are fine with pardoning Trump with a similar spread of evidence.  Given that we know Epstein raped girls repeatedly at his home right by Mar a Lago, there is absolutely no reason why Trump would need to fly on the plane or go to the island to join in on the raping.\n\nSo either let Clinton and Trump go, or hold them both potentially guilty.  You can\u2019t really have both without a healthy dose of cognitive dissonance.",

Therefore, only if they recruited and enslaved girls in the US to use on the island would they have legal exposure, unless the feds work with the country that island is a part of and they find a girl who was under that country\u2019s age of consent and then the US extradites the offenders.

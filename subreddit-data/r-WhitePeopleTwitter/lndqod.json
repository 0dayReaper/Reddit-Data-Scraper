The American system is extremely inefficient, an enormous waste that goes right into the pockets of the private sector. My country (Norway) has universal healthcare, and extensive welfare.\n\nAnd while US government spending on Medicare is 27% (according to the guy above), 17% of government expenditure goes to health (on universal healthcare ++) here. While the health sector make up 17% of the US GDP, the corresponding number for Norway is 10.2%. \n\nAmericans are getting fleeced big time, and they vividly insist on paying more money for a worse service.\n\nAnother fun fact; They always talk about how you need to raise taxes to accomplish this, which is obviously not true, as you can see from the numbers above. But regardless of that, I pay the same amount of taxes currently as I would if I lived in New York. Except if I lived in the US, I would have to pay for health insurance on top of that.",

There can be a fee, a lot of the countries use it as way to stop abuse and commit people to their appointments and treatments.\nIn Europe even when we pay is, usually, a reasonable amount.\nAnd yes, we still get to go to private if we want and no, we don't wait for ever.",

What makes it better insurance is that the max out of pocket is 6,500 and everything counts towards the deductible (Rx, wellness checks, immunizations, etc. all go into the same pool). \n\nWe also only have a copay once we meet the deductible, not copay and coinsurance. \n\nI couldn't believe I was \"happy\" with a 5.5K deductible.

But you have the right to free visits, most tests are just copay (it really depends on how much you earn, someone earning 30000 is still in the first group and pays nothing), and most of medicines are free (some are not even for the first group). How much would someone who earns 30k pay for healthcare in the US?\n\nUgh tax are complicated I get everything already calculated every month with my pay I didn't realize how complicated it was to just calculate the basic cut.",

And that\u2019s if your insurance even lets you see a specialist without a referral. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll actually need to wait until your GP has an opening (a few days, maybe, but plan for a week), and *then* begin the specialist waiting process. And that doesn\u2019t even get into insurance costs or deductibles/set out of pockets, which can be high even with the \u201cbetter\u201d plans. Someone who doesn\u2019t go to the doctor all year may save money, sure, but anyone who needs to go a few times is probably \u201closing\u201d nearly as much money as they would with higher taxes anyway. \n\nAmericans who don\u2019t want universal healthcare are either ill-informed or ill-intentioned.",

The law is called EMTALA and it was signed by Ronald Reagan in 1986. \n\nEver since then, the US has had universal health care, just really shitty and completely stupid universal health care. Since almost nobody advocates for repealing EMTALA, there isn\u2019t really a debate over whether we should have universal health care, just whether we should do it properly or keep doing it like we do now, with emergency rooms as the universal point of care for people with no alternative.",

I mean sure, I totally get that it would suck to have paid out $80K and then see someone else pay next to nothing, but at some point that\u2019s basically gotta happen to people if we\u2019re going to make any forward progress on helping with student loan debt. You can\u2019t not forgive person B\u2019s debt because person A is mad that they paid theirs off themselves before forgiveness started. That\u2019s literally person A saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t get mine, so neither should you,\u201d and is a pretty selfish way to think if you ask me. Person A can have a, \u201cthat super sucks!\u201d mentality while still being happy they were in a position to pay off $80K in loans in the first place and still being happy for person B that they don\u2019t have to be saddled with debt. It doesn\u2019t have to be either or.\n\nEdit to clarify: it was just a basic, big picture, hypothetical, etc. conversation (not going into the nuances so as to keep the peace) with my mom - the main point I was making there was that we should be happy if, with minimal impact to our wallets compared to what we currently pay for these services, our tax dollars could provide more meaningful tuition and/or debt assistance that allowed future generations to not be as burdened, and to make that happen basically means there will people that paid for some portion of tuition or debt repayment that future generations (including *their* descendants, mind you) won\u2019t have to.",

            "comment": "Never forget: **86% of all federal tax revenue comes directly out of the paychecks of working Americans.** \n\nWhenever you hear someone talk about the \u201cjob creators\u201d and their tax contribution, remember that if you combine every dollar of every corporation\u2019s tax contributions in the U.S., you only get **7% of federal tax revenue.** \n\nAlso, that 7% figure is from 2016 when the top tax rate for corporations was 38%. Republicans passed a law in 2017 that nearly halved their tax rate to 21%. It was already insultingly low, now it\u2019s next to nothing.\n\nAn average American household earning $50,000/year contributes $36/year towards food stamps, $6 towards all other forms of social safety net programs, and **$5,500 in corporate subsidies.**\n\nThe ownership class has succeeded in getting the middle class to hate the lower class over $36/year while they rob us blind for **152 times more than what we pay in taxes for welfare and food stamps**. We\u2019re fighting over crumbs while they take the whole cake. Next time you hear someone talking about \u201cpaying for lazy entitled welfare recipients\u201d, remind them who the real welfare queens are in America.\n\nThat\u2019s right, you pay thousands of dollars per year to trillion-dollar corporations that have literally written the tax and market laws so that they not only pay little or no taxes, but get billions of taxpayer dollars in grants and subsidies and an unfair advantage that circumvents the free market.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of that $5,500 for every one of the 115 million American families:\n\n-\t$100 billion a year ($870 per household) on direct corporate welfare, direct subsidies and grants to companies. This is money coming straight out of your paycheck and going straight to corporations, many of them trillion-dollar oil &amp; gas companies.\n-\t$80 billion a year ($696 per household) for business incentives at the state, county, and city levels. For example, Amazon not only didn\u2019t pay taxes last year, but got a $128 million tax refund via state and municipal incentives.\n-\t$83 billion a year ($722 per household) for interest rate subsidies for banks.\n-\t$40 billion a year ($350 per household) on retirement fund bank fees, typically about a third of your investment returns over your lifetime.\n-\t$270 billion a year ($1,268 per household) on overpayments for medications due to government-granted monopolies raising prices above the fair market price. This is unique to the United States. We basically subsidize the profits of pharmaceutical corporations while the rest of the world gets cheap prescriptions at reasonable profit margins. An eight-week retroviral therapy course of medication in the U.S. costs $60,000 out-of-pocket (not covered by insurance) while the same course of medication costs $1,100 or $440 out-of-pocket  in Canada and India, respectively.\n-\t$181 billion ($1,600 per family) paying for taxes evaded by corporations via offshoring of profits, underreporting of revenue, exaggerating expenses, or undervaluing of assets. The average billionaire pays less than 1% of their income in taxes. Donald Trump paid either $750 or zero dollars in 10 of the last 15 years of tax returns available. That\u2019s less than a person working minimum wage pays over the same period of time.\n\nRemember the $900 billion COVID relief bill Republicans passed in December 2020? That\u2019s enough for $7,826 for every one of the 115 million American families. Instead we got $600-$1,200 per family. Where did the other 93% of that $900 billion in OUR taxpayer dollars go? Who did they give OUR money to during this crisis? \n\n**We need a revolution in this country.** Hard-working Americans like me and you pay 86% of the taxes and get almost nothing in return.",

It's not always about a broken arm or leg, it's also about feeling that something is not okay in your body and being able to get It checked out just in case, and not going back home half broke. You could go because of a bit of pain somewhere and being told that you just need a bit of rest, but ar least you know it's nothing big. Or maybe it was something important, but chances are you detected it in time at the very least. \n\nAnd I really don't get the \"who's going to pay for it\" argument. \"Oh, so now I have to pay for medical expenses on my taxes? But what if I don't need it?\" Why would I pay something I'm not going to use?\". Well, first, you are going to use it. And second, is it really that big of a deal to pay for something you theoretically are not going to use, when at least other people get to be healthy thanks to that? Because I think it's one of the most selfish, childish argument I've ver heard. Oh, you didn't need to go to the doctor this year? Good for you. What you paid saved a couple thousand people this year, and probably ten times more people got their body fixed to a lesser or bigger degree. Seriously, what's wrong with that?",

            "comment": "Many people use the high cost of taxes in more progressive countries as the reason we can\u2019t have similar health care here. However, I would like to point out that in many of those countries, their tax rate scale is close to ours (my household pays 34% in the US; in Sweden, I would pay 34%, and in Germany, I think it is 42%). However, in the US, I have exactly none of the same benefits as those countries. That makes me enraged. Why can\u2019t we have nice things too? Oh yeah....we prioritize corporations and the 1% over the rest of the population. I would like to also point out that UNLIKE the US, the extremely wealthy in those countries are not exempt from paying taxes... that alone is a big reason why we can\u2019t have nice things. Disclaimer: I am not an economist or anyone with extensive knowledge in this area, so if I am missing something that negates my argument, please tell me so I can be less mad.",

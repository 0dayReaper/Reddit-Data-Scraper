Once lawmakers started going after transitioning past the age of 18, suddenly legal age no longer mattered, and it was all about when the brain finished developing. \n\nSo the answer to why they talk about kids in regards to consenting adults? They want to \"avoid\" exposure to \"mature content.\" Thus, by pointing out the double standard of childhood romance of fictional characters, I'd argue it removes the false veil of \"think of the children\" and forces the bigots to admit to their bigotry or drop the attacks...",

He woke up at 3am feeling anxious about some stupid thing he said in 1st period back in high school, which then got him thinking about the world ending, and then the protests, and then started remembering how shit everything is, which led to COVID, and finally the funny thought enetered his brain. But of course, he has social anxiety so he couldnt pull out his phone right then and tweet it, he had to wait until it seemed at least remotely socially acceptable to be awake. So he laid there in bed, excietedly giggling to himself back to sleep, until the sun peaked through the curtains forcing him awake, at which point he drafted the tweet, deleted it, redrafted it, took a shit, spent 20 minutes practicing his Noble Peace Prize speech in the mirror to build up confidence, finally hitting send, followed by feeling both thrilled and like a moron, left the house because he couldnt sit down and spent his whole time in line at the coffee shop refreshing twitter to see if anyone got offended and he should delete it.",

People that die from the flu or coronavirus overwhelmingly are over the age of 50 and have multiple diseases. \n2. Secondly, dying isn't the only factor. If my entire neighbourhood burns down, i am fucked. I have no where to get anything other than Amazon. If my car shits the bed, i can't get it fixed. If i need medical help, my dentist burned down and i can't. The area is ruined and uninhabitable.\n3. Compounding on the above, lets say i am in the middle of a riot or looting frenzy. A flu isn't going to kill me, nor is the 'rona. Its going to be some dickhead upset with me that i'm trying to stop him from burning my or someone elses business. \n4. I know being empathetic is hard for people that support rioters and looters, but i'm going to force-feed you this anyway: think about someone other than yourself. There are disabled and elderly people that rely on shops like Target, that have one and only one place they shop at for years, because going anywhere else is too far. What happens to them when you burn shit down? Well, simple - they're financially crippled due to having to move, they rapidly deteriorate and die, or, in the best case scenario, you just piss them off a ton and they rely on Amazon and just stop going to the dentist and everything else that burned down.\n\nSo there you go, thats why people are scared of communist hordes , 15 year old black kids that have been amped up and handed bricks and molotovs and mentally ill folk out for a night of destruction.\n\nAgain, its just basic empathy and respect. Realise millions of people are terrified in their homes every time fireworks go off en-masse at new years. Now imagine how they feel when its not fireworks, but pipe bombs and gunshots going off?",

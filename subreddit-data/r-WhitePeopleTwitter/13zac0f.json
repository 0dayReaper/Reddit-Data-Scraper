They get useless training modules. Senior roles teach new hires to disregard a lot of things that could potentially help people.

One year I invited a good friend who is a vet of Afghanistan over for the holiday. He politely declined and explained that he doesn't deal well with the fireworks. It had not occurred to me until that moment that our celebrations traumatized the people who were directly responsible for having the celebration. I haven't taken part in fireworks since and I hope drone technology and the like can soon replace fireworks. I doubt it happens, cuz 'Merica and blowing up shit, but I'm hopeful. I've also never seen a dog have a good experience around fireworks.",

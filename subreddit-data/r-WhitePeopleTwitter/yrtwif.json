Even at $35 per month with the coupon, you're paying for their actual rate with grossly elevated premiums.\n\nIf you pay for 20% of a $1,000 prescription as a copay but they give you a coupon to get it down to $35, they still will bill your insurance for $800 and you'll be less likely to fight it.\n\nOne of the reasons I hate prescription coupons like this (even though I completely get they save people in the short term) is that it blunts the price sensitivity of consumers and allows the abusive bilking of insurance by pharma companies to go unpunished by moves to generics or pushing for legislative fixes.",

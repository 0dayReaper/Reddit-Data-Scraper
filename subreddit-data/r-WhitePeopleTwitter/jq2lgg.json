Obama's not some perfect savior, but he did as good as he could for the country -- even though he chose to 'forgive and forget' the Bush administration's war crimes. I like Obama well enough, but he shouldn't have received a Nobel Peace Prize. I would vote for him if given the chance, but I will still criticize where needed. \n\nTrump supporters could never do that. Trump blatantly violated the emolument clause for 4 years straight, operated a fraudulent university and charity, is still stealing millions of taxpayers' money through golfing, did nothing about the Russian bounties, would not publicize his tax returns, allowed the government to shut down 3 times over a useless wall, abandoned the Kurds, extorted Ukraine to interfere in our election, would not enforce Russian sanctions, saluted a North Korean general, prevented White House employees from testifying in the impeachment, gave a grinning thumbs up with a newly-orphaned baby straight after the El Paso terrorist attack, called Neo-Nazis 'very fine people, disclosed Israel national secrets to Russians, had meetings with Russian officials with no American media present, has over 25+ sexual assault allegations, and allowed Erdogan's goons to assault American civilians on U.S. soil. \n\nIf I can criticize Obama for his faults, why the fuck can Trump supporters not criticize Trump for his?",

But someone on Reddit posted a detailed, sourced list the one day that accounted for each flight Clinton took with Epstein (which I cannot seem to turn up again under all the noise from his death). Since a president doing anything makes news, and there was a contemporaneous article attached to each log entry. So I went through each one: Clinton borrowed the plane to do some charity work in Haiti, to go to a UN event, to globe trot to diplomatic functions across Europe, and on and on, each doing something open, public and documented in the press, with clear start and end times, never doing anything private, never visiting the residences or island of Epstein, or even having Epstein on board.\n\nIt's kind of hard to argue with a list of *9:13 am Clinton boards Epstein's jet in NY, 4:40 pm Clinton deplanes in London, addresses dignitaries at 6 pm dinner, here are the news articles about it from the day it happened*. I just don't really see any wiggle room (unlike a certain someone who had private parties with Epstein and Maxwell).",

I'd argue Obama was our first internet social media president, but it was more like a teacher who uses social media to his advantage to look cool (it worked with younger people and his charisma worked for the older people).  Trump is the next iteration of this, why I call it a 'true' social media president is because he made Twitter the official  word of the presidency, an unprecedented and extremely crass way of doing it.  He appeals to the people who love drama about celebrities and the 'tribalism' that comes with it.  There has always been people like this but they never got their (minority) voice heard because they are quiet when there was less internet social media that is (in a dramatic way) ruining our political world.",

It's the communities that gave rise to people like Kyle Rittenhause, Dylann Roof, Wade Michael Page, Timothy McVeigh, and others.\n\nThey're given a bullhorn by the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, and Mark Levin.\n\nWe've got a lot of work to do.",

Many will of course still vote Republican but a fair amount aren't going to show up for someone they see as an establishment candidate, they'll just stay home and complain.  Trump for all his problems managed to convince a bunch of people that he was on their side and that voting for him made their enemies sad.  They were passionate and committed to him.  The people chanting Can't Stump Trump aren't going to show up with passion for Pence or Rubio.  \n\nOn the other side he convinced a lot of people that normally weren't engaged that they had important reasons to care.  Obviously 4 years is a long time and things can change but I think Republicans will have a problem getting people excited about them while at the same time they've poisoned their brand for large groups of the population.",

These are NOT political differences anymore, they are world defining ideological differences that we who study history KNOW gall horrors are born out of.  \n\nThe US is as far from \u201ccommunism\u201d as we are from landing a person on Venus, but we are very much on doorstep of a radicalized Nationalistic Conservatism with theological ideology as we\u2019ve ever been.\n\nIf you\u2019re not one of them, your conservative neighbor, your co-worker, ..your \u201cfriend\u201d will kill you when they\u2019re called on to do so.  You don\u2019t support Trump without being VERY susceptible to propaganda of hate. They\u2019ll feel justified to do it. They\u2019ll do it thinking they\u2019re patriots. But this is the truly the kind of people they are.  Sad times ahead. [edit: spelling]",

Mysteriously all the white conservatives who had been vocally campaigning for Republicans at work had their time offs approved and got Election Day off and liberals and black people were rescheduled\nTo Cover for Them.  Within a week I personally saw 3 black coworkers who had taken too long to vote fired for abusing lunch time privileges.\n\nEvery one who was a liberal knew that the consequence for taking too long to vote was\nGoing to be being fired.\n\nFrom what I heard because the reason for firing was attendance related those people\nDid not have unemployment approved.   \n\nIf you wonder why republicans and conservitave laws always win in Oklahoma this is why.

Looking at it more, I work for a private company, we don\u2019t get Presidents\u2019 Day off, we get 5 holidays a year, there was talk a few years back about changing it to 4. As a private company the government can\u2019t tell them what days they are required to have off. \n\nAt some point in early voting I had some concrete work done. I don\u2019t know why but it made me think of the people who do manual labor and are without healthcare and vacation and sick days and work hourly. Then I started thinking about all hourly employees like that. They can\u2019t afford to take off work for 6 hours or even 2 hours to stand in line to vote. And these people don\u2019t get holidays or PTO so you think they are going to get paid to vote or take the time off to vote. \n\nI\u2019m in a Tennesee, we have early voting, but in my local area only one location was open per county. I stood in line for 2 hours to early vote. I don\u2019t even live in Knoxville, Nashville, Chattanooga, or Memphis, I\u2019m in a rural area. Day of election the polls opened at 7am and closed at 6 pm. How is someone who works 8 to 5 suppose to stand in line for 2 hours before their shift and be late to work that day or are they suppose to stand in line AFTER they worked a physical job all day. No we need to make early mail in voting easier in my state. Fear of Covid was not a valid reason to vote by mail in TN.",

In addition to the standard 1/2/4 year cycles for Election Day we also have primary elections, runoff elections, primary runoffs, and special elections that will vary by city/county/state. \n\nSo you can\u2019t just give people November second off of work without saying all of these other elections are less important. Certainly the presidential race isn\u2019t the only election that matters.\n\nEdit: to answer your question we also have early voting but the rules vary by state.",

At that point Dems have a supermajority and passing it would only increase their power. Some liberals might even balk at a one party state we\u2019d end up with in this situation.

There's also an online ballot tracker so you know your ballot was received and counted. I don't know why other states haven't caught on to this.",

(Most low income workers work food, retail, hospitality where the holidays see a increase of workload in these areas as white collar workers have the day off)\n\nSo instead of trying to make a holiday happen, make voter registration easier, double or triple voting stations, make mail in voting more accessible, etc etc.\n\nNeither side is going to want to forcible close businesses, it hurts the economy and hurts the business friendly facade they both put on, not to mention it isn't required.  So i would argue for people to stop the national or federal holiday for voting day, it is at best unattainable, at worse hurtful, work towards actual improvements of ease of registration and voting.",

The Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, and 15th) were huge in how they established rules for protecting the rights of the disenfranchised. Eliminating slavery, establishing equal protections under the law, and most importantly protecting the rights of non whites to vote. \n\nIn fact, those Amendments were so bold and transformative you could argue that getting the South to actually follow them was a civil war in of itself that we *lost* in 1877 by compromising the enforcement of those amendments in the South for a republican President. It wouldn't be until the Civil Rights movement that we finally see a national effort to commit ourselves to the enforcement of these laws, which should have always been in play\n\n\nEdit: And what is the state of the reconstruction amendments currently? Each are under assault by the GOP. The 13th amendment doesn't eliminate all forms of slavery, but through private persons we have just created slavery with extra steps. The Trump administration and Kanye West though think we can just repeal the 13th. The 14th amendment has been suggested by the Trump administration to be partly repealed, particularly the protections for people born in the US to be citizens despite parents lacking citizenship. Lastly, state GOP govts have been doing their best to dismantle the 15th amendment, arguing it isn't necessary anymore while also arguing that increasing voters would make it difficult for Republicans to win office",

Also you don't have anyone to process the ballots because federal workers are off for the holiday.  Did anyone think this through?",

That disadvantages people who need those services to go vote.\n\nInstead of Election Day off, we need longer earlier voting for more hours, universal registration, and more opportunities for people to vote by mail for those who cannot vote in person. Basically we need to make sure people who work odd hours and different days have plenty of opportunity to vote, even with a hectic after-work schedule.",

They are very aware that the more people that vote the less seats they will hold due to America\u2019s changing demographics that are set to currently make the entire party obsolete within 20 years as long as they are set on their traditional and new platforms. They have a vested interest in voter suppression and gerrymandering. Right now they still have enough power to block efforts to make voting easier for Americans and can even gaslight their own base into thinking their is automatic widespread voter fraud for mailing in votes which has a process no different than military voting or absentee voting.",

He's discovered that it was massively outdated and was not pharmacologically ranked but done on a moral basis, so zero science involved whatsoever. He said it was ridiculous and that exstacy is no more dangerous than horse riding when you look at the fatalities etc. He also noted that alcohol is one of the worst substances, more so than heroin when you take into account the financial and societal costs on a nation. The government responded by firing him. So since then he's gone on to create something called alcosynth (I may have the name slightly wrong) which is a synthetic alcohol that gives much the same intoxication effects without the physical damage that alcohol does to our bodies. The real mad thing is though, is that due to the way our drug laws work now, that substance will be banned the minute it is released to the public because it's considered a new psychoactive substance (NPS). So basically the government hired a guy to fix the state of our outdated drug laws, then fired him when he told them the truth but also made it impossible for any safer alternatives to reach the market. The guy is [Professor David Nutt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nutt) and I'd highly recommend looking him up.",

H\u00e4nig, which was a translation of a German paper, Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes, which was written in 1901.[2] The unclear representation of data in the former paper suggested that each part of the tongue tastes exactly one basic taste.[3][4]\n\n&gt; The paper showed minute differences in threshold detection levels across the tongue,[5] but these differences were later taken out of context and the minute difference in threshold sensitivity was misconstrued in textbooks as a difference in sensation.[6]\n\n&gt; While some parts of the tongue may be able to detect a taste before the others do, all parts are equally capable of conveying the qualia of all tastes. Threshold sensitivity may differ across the tongue, but intensity of sensation does not.[6]\n\n&gt; The same paper included a taste bud distribution diagram that showed a \"taste belt\".[7]\n\n&gt; In 1974, Virginia Collings investigated the topic again, and confirmed that all the tastes exist on all parts of the tongue.[8]",

The key with sources, is to get as close to the original information as possible. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and you shouldn't really be sourcing those. Wikipedia is great for gathering information and seeing what topics you should be looking into (not to mention the great sources cited in the articles), but you should be using more peer-reviewed sources.\n\nWikipedia is much better though than some random blog-style website online, and as strong (if not stronger, in my opinion) as any other physical encyclopedia like Britannica.\n\nSo make use of Wikipedia as much as you can, but try to use better sources when possible for anything serious.\n\nOh and thanks for the awards!",

Let\u2019s spend 40% of the year studying revolutionary war battles, 30% on studying civil war battles, and 20% on WWII battles, giving cursory mention of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and post Civil War Amendments.  Oops-we ran out of time this year. Also A President was assassinated, and another President got shot but survived.  \n\nAnd, if you tried to read ahead on your textbook (during my lectures on war battles), you\u2019ll see there are only single paragraphs about the Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam, Watergate.  \n\nOh, and what was life actually like for different people throughout history?  Who cares? \n\nThe important thing is that we checked every box on the state curriculum standards.",

All throughout my schooling textbooks were anywhere from 10 to 30 years old. No matter what we were learning shit that was at least 10 years old. My high school was built while I was in Jr high, so the textbooks were only 4 to 5 years old by the time I got there. There was still only one computer lab, and you couldn't access the internet. We used them for word processing, and everyone had their own disk for storage that were held in the lab. I like to think kids are being taught the most current information due to the internet. My daughter is a sophomore, and goes to the same high school I did. It's still the newest high school in like 50 square miles. The next behind it was built in like 1971. My daughter was issued her own laptop (there's about 3500 kids attending this high school), and like a quarter of the textbooks I was. Hopefully that means they are getting up to date knowledge. It will still change, but at least it's not outdated while they're learning it.",

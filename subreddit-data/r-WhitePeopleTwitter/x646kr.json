I have a coworker who talks like this.  its the unpopular kids who get tricked into being gay because crafty gay men are nice to them and temp them into being gay because gay guys were the only ones who weren't mean to them.  That is how they trick them.  \n\nOdd how it always seems to raise the question of why all the straight people were so hateful that they made it possible for the sneaky gay guys to swoop in with nothing more than being nice to them.",

At least not in the sense you think. \n\nIt's unfortunately not uncommon in the gay community to see men in their 60s who come out after a lifetime of forcing themselves to be straight. They're often not even bisexual. They didn't really make the choice, society did it for them. \n\nAnd it's such a difficult situation. On the one hand, it should never be too late for you to be your true self. On the other hand, they built an entire life on a foundation of lies, and it absolutely destroys families. The wife ends up feeling used and unloved, justifiably so. \n\nWhen you know what will happen if you ever were to stop hiding it from everyone, it might be even more tempting to hide it forever. And with that, resentment grows rampant.\n\nThat's not to say those closeted bigots are to be pitied, but it's important to know that they are a product of their environment. They're a reminder of how much things have improved, but also a reminder that there's a long way to go still to make sure it never has to happen like that for anyone else.",

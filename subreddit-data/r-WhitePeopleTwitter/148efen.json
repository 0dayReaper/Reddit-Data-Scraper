Al Jazeera would have sent people in. Vice would have done a documentary on the kid. Finland probably would have invited the school's principal over for dinner.\n\nThat kid would now be streaming on twitch, shitting in a litterbox on OnlyFans, and making millions per year in talk show appearances.

See lockdown arrests for having a party at a friends house for why this totally would happen. Afterall it happened during the world wide trails man. \n\n\nReality is \n\nCities should be planned that all amenities required for life are within 15 minutes walking distance for the average person. This includes schools; groceries; hair dressers; primary healthcare; a green space or two etc etc\n\nPublic transport; pedestrian;  cyclists experience  and general air quality is improved by placing limits on cars. You have to pay to drive through the city and residental zones(and only allowed to do so, so many times) except the one you live in. If you want to go elsewhere  in the city you have to drive out onto the ring roads drive round the city then go back in to the part you need to get to from the ring road.\n\nBy moving personal car usage out of the cities and onto main roads only; public transport becomes more efficient and easier to plan; pedestrians and cyclists are generally safer and have an easier time.\n\n\nHence why only cities with the existing infrastructure to attempt this are actually trying to implement now while others are looking at gradually doing so over time once they have the infrastructure.",

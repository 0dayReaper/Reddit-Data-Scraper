In typical blackmail, part of the threat is not just to reveal something but also that there's something to reveal at all. In this instance, everybody already kind of assumed the information that Grindr threatens to reveal was true. Can you blackmail someone when it's already public?\n\nWith that said, my guess is that libel laws kind of already clarify a lot of this, but I don't know enough about that. Because if the information is true, then it's not libel. WHICH MEANS THAT THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE USE GRINDR WILL BE **LEGALLY CONFIRMED**. LOL. \n\nAssuming they pursue a libel suit, but I'm almost certain they would. They might not win the suit, but knowing the demographic of these people I'd say losing that case would make their supporters more sure of a conspiracy theory than winning it would.",

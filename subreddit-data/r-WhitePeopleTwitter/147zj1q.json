But if you look at the laws that were on he books in several states, until the 2003 SCOTUS ruling Lawrence v. Texas, made sodomy illegal. Btw, Texas failed to officially remove that law this year, for perspective. So if somebody you were getting intimate with, was actually about to involve you in a crime, maybe you would freak out a little bit? I dunno. \n\nWe live in a country where there is still an intentional bias on the part of some state governments to suppress the existence and activities of non cis-het people. To that end, it makes sense there would be a legal mechanism by which somebody could murder a gay or trans person and get away with it.\n\nAs a side note, a friend of mine knew a woman who got the shit beat out of her by her then-boyfriend because she tried to stick her finger somewhere he was uncomfortable with during coitus. So... Maybe the poop chute has an angry mode button up there or something? (/s just in case anybody was confused about that)",

That's going to be some shit you're never going to live down. For the rest of your life, when you least expect it you'll find yourself thinking about that thing you did and all the different ways you could have been kinder or more empathetic, but haha, there's no way you could have known, I'm just saying. Sucks to be human, right?\"\n\nFellow redditor, let me tell you that your dad knew that you weren't just asking him for money. You were going to him because he was the guy you could rely on. I'm guessing he didn't tell you he was sick because he didn't want to disappoint you, and I'm guessing that because that's exactly what my dad would have done too. And if he was anything like my dad, he knew you loved him in a way both he and you couldn't express easily. If an absolution from a random commentor on this dumb site means anything, you've got mine. Be good to yourself, dude - your dad knew.\n\nEdited to add: you all are too kind. Keep being awesome, you good and valuable folks.",

I was perplexed when I first read this post, because I saw the image first and was surprised that Fox was running a flattering Biden story. Then, it fell into place that this was supposed to be a damaging quote for Biden. \n\nSo many of us needed that sort of love and support in our lives. Some of us receive support and care from our loved ones and make it through the rough patch, and lots of us don\u2019t make it through crises, too, regardless of support. Some of us who make it through despite unsupportive environments have vowed to break the cycle and make things better for our children. It truly saddens me to think that empathy, concern, and support of our struggling loved ones is considered, to Conservatives, to be a liability rather than an asset.",

Might be overthinking but to critically analyze to the fullest, he is offering support and love which is #1, he is saying he needs help (could be perceived as negative to an addict), he kind of counters that negativity by saying idk what u need neither do you, this is tremendous. Though it brings the negative feelings it trumps that by saying \u201clisten nobody knows exactly what you need but we all you need something\u201d every addict knows they need something besides what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s painfully obvious. I couldn\u2019t really see this being brought out by anything but love. Imagine your kid is apprentice to satan himself and you just go \u201chey bud I love you so much (story about early parenting), I really think you should explore some options; but, maybe you\u2019ve found your place, anyway come home for dinner anytime, cheers!\u201d",

In America there are milions of parents who are veterans traumatised by the enormous military complex. Then there are millions with zero paid parental leave or holidays, many are forced to send their kids to understaffed unlicensed daycare. They also often have to work multiple jobs and can't spend any quality time with their children. \n\nSo the lack of empathy for working classes and raging inequality is fuelling further drop in empathy and rise in inequality. Ironically everyone loses out because those people with no empathy will have power over you one way or another and will ruin your day and your life.\n\nOne of startling statistics is babies born to well off families have lower rates of survival in the USA than in Europe. Empathy among nursing staff may well be a contributing factor.",

Hunter Biden survived a car crash that killed his mother and younger sister, as well as fracturing his skull and suffering a TBI when he was a little under 3. TBIs are well known to cause major personality disorders, and if you add some baked in trauma from that? It's not always going to turn out pretty.",

Biden and his older brother Beau were also seriously injured but survived. Beau suffered multiple broken bones while Hunter sustained a fractured skull and severe traumatic brain injuries. Both spent several months in the hospital...\n\nI wonder if his daughter is named after his sister:\n\n&gt; Biden married Kathleen Buhle in 1993. They have three daughters: Naomi, Finnegan, and Maisy.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, she is. [In a Twitter thread,](https://old.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j33ah5/this_tweet_about_hunter_biden_by_his_daughter/) she says \"my namesake\" when talking about her aunt.",

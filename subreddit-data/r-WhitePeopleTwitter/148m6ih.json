See, no conservatives question that white christians are the \\*rightful\\* rulers of America and are more deserving of its protections than non-whites and non-christians. That's baked into \\*everything\\* in America and has been since 1619. \n\nBut ever since Obama, that defacto white christian dominance isn't holding up so well. Not just Obama getting elected, but advertisers turning to favor other demographics is a very clear measure to them of how they've fallen. And it's not that 'oh, gee, we're minorities now' has sunk in, but that despite being minorities, they are still supposed to have that cultural veto, and nobody is respecting it, so someone must be cheating. \n\nThe problem young people in particular run into is that they read 'all men are created equal' and say 'how secular humanist of them'. But when conservatives read it they fill in the missing words 'all white christian men are created equal, and all others are unequal'. \n\nAnd the trick here is that conservatives aren't wrong about those missing words. When they were written, black people were property, white women were effectively property, christian prayer in school was assumed, and so on. But things have changed in the 250 years since those words were written, and we're about to have a pretty serious throw-down over whose interpretation is the correct one.",

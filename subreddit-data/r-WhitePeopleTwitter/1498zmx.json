He fought for 60 years to get his discharge changed from \"dishonorable\" until he finally won. Despite having a very successful career as a provost of a major university and a founding member of a lot of arts and culture organizations in NYC, the only request for his wake and funeral was that it was he was buried with military honors and someone to say some words about his service. We actually got in arguments with him when he was near the end and making arrangements, he was always like \"I don't care, it's my funeral what I say goes, just bury me with our flag\". His service meant that much to him even after the Navy treated him so poorly",

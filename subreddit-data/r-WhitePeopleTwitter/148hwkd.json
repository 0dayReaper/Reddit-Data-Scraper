They want nothing more than to be shown a social hierarchy and their place in it, and they will defend that hierarchy to the death, provided there is someone below them on it. For all their bluster about not wanting to be told what to do, they want nothing more than social stability and to know without any doubt whom they are above, and whom they are below.  They crave it, and will jump through all kinds of hoops to worship and defend what they view to be the proper authority over them.\n\nAt their core, they're scared little children, afraid of the big bad world and of their agency within it.",

That's how brainwashed they are, literally anything as long as it makes them feel like they're in this \"us vs them\" conspiracy. Cop outright kills innocent black man? They support the cop. Billionaires getting tax breaks and handouts then complaining about people on welfare? They support the billionaires. Stupidest person alive elected president, committing a shit load of crimes while in office? Hey, as long as he doesn't actually denounce white supremacists or openly starts supporting lgbtq people, they'll follow him to the end of the world.\n\nThey know their \"opinions\" are going to be unpopular, they crave it, they want to feel like they've stumbled onto some bigger truth than everyone else and be hated for it. They want to feel smarter without actually being smarter, and they want to claim martyrdom while doing it. Guaranteed if tomorrow Biden said we needed to make the US a christian nation they would start burning bibles and churches just so they could say Biden is being unconstitutional for even suggesting it. If trump said the day after that he is a Satanist fighting against the evil christians that are the left, they would all be in satanic churches by the end of the week.",

Of course we would.

At worst the evidence was manufactured and dumped on an old hard drive. \n\nYou really don't want to get a Digital Forensics specialist from the FBI/CIA roped into this as they would utterly decimate the GOP story once and for all. I assume the GOP know this as well, which is why its just a sound byte for them to rile up their base who begs their phone providers to bring back dumb phones, as they are not smart enough to use their smart phones. If there was any Truth to this, you would have seen tweets quoting digital forensics experts on the laptop for 12 months prior to the election. They are scared to really keep pushing the issue as much as they claim, because they know an expert will not only tear it apart, but probably provide insight that could get Trump/Rudy/whomever more charges.",

So better open an investigation that found nothing, while still lying about his votes, while claiming he would have had the most votes still because millions of votes for Hillary was illegal, thus removing those theoretical votes means he won the popular vote. \n\nAnd his voters are like: \"Yup, makes perfect sense to me.

They never really leave these small towns, so small if you blink while driving at 60mph you pass through the entire town. They only associate with others in the area and for the most part that means with 75% or better white people. Even the local wal-mart in the area is not even close to being diverse. Walmart also being the biggest employer in a 30 mile radius to boot.\n\nThey rely on \"News\" like fox news to tell them what life is like in the bigger metro cities. They never visit those cities, because Fox news paints them to be apocalyptical wastelands. So out of their own fear they rarely go to them, unless absolutely needed.\n\nOne of my neighbors, not only 100% believes COVID-19 is caused by 5G towers, that masks are more harmful to you (She cares for elderly people for a living during COVID) and also does not wear seatbelts when driving as \"Seat Belts are more dangerous in a wreck, than not wearing a seatbelt in a wreck\". While living in a very rural area where most roads at 50-60MPH in deer country. Other people literally will sit out camping at a firepit reciting bullshit posts they \"saw the other day\" on facebook. \n\nAlso around here, not too many people actually own computers. I am the only person on my block that actually has internet according to ISP tech that shown up to fix my cable as someone kicked the above ground box over 2 weeks ago and my internet went to shit.\n\nThis is pretty much a decent description for your average rural voter, since many are so rural they won't be able to even get internet, unless it's star link. All their news is fox news and what their neighbors repeat that they may have gleamed from a few posts on the internet. They live in a bubble that became their own safe space and refuse to believe anything that contradicts what their friends and family believe.",

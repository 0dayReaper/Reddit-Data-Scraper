That'll help you understand if you really need an unlimited plan or not.\n\nI guess also look at Google Fi, they have almost the same prices and I personally I'm a fan.\n\nEdit: \n\nAdding this in a just in case my other comment gets lost for the folks just scrolling by. Make sure your plan has the taxes and fees rolled into it so that you can avoid surprises and make sure that you build up credit by paying off small recurring bills like this with a credit card.\n\nAnd if for whatever reason you can't apply to a normal one, get a secured credit card from a bank, you will need to make a deposit with the bank (usually around $100) but that will give you a credit card and you're able to start building credit by doing something you were already going to be doing anyways, which is paying your phone bill.",

We save too many poor people and don't charge the middle class near enough to make them poor.  The death panels are mostly corporate sellouts, not a single decent one in the draft ether.  One day we will fulfill our dream of only rich people allowed in hospitals and actually performing medicine for them. \n\n/s",

No matter how much I can save us a month, no matter how many pennies I can pinch, even with our insurance, our deductible alone could take everything we have in our bank accounts to cover. \n\nInsurance here is a joke. I had to get blood work done and it was $517. Insurance paid that $17 so...yay? \n\nLooking forward to the day I can move out of the country.",

It\u2019s often not healthy and they\u2019re usually, at the very least, pretty dehydrated. It gives others and misguided view of body image and leads to self-image issues.\n\nNot to mention these guys get world class trainers and dietitians that we don\u2019t.",

For vacation and some random dude comes up to him and asks for a picture. So he took it with him then asked if the guy was a fan of the show and it turns out the guy had never seen Sunny and didn't know who Rob was, he just wanted a photo bc he said Rob had the best body he'd ever seen lol. So there are perks to it",

While protesters were being placed in handcuffs, they shouted \"shame\" at police officers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In a news release, the Tallahassee Police Department said that protesters against the abortion ban were told they would have to leave after sunset, but 11 people refused to go and were arrested for trespassing.",

It is *deep* red here, one of the most red counties in Texas.\n\nFor years I used to watch conservatives on local social media spew their bullshit and spit venom at liberals and Californian transplants (the majority of which are conservative, but they don\u2019t seem to realize that\u2026), and I said nothing because I knew it wouldn\u2019t go over well since I\u2019d never seen anyone oppose them before. I just didn\u2019t want the drama.\n\nBut shortly after Trump, I\u2019d had enough. I started challenging them constantly. \n\nSuddenly, I was getting floods of DMs from all these other Dems in town thanking me for saying something and telling me they were too scared to even like my comments, let alone comment themselves. They literally feared violence and retaliation, especially because this is a small town where everyone knows each other kind of thing.\n\nIt motivated me, and made me feel like what I was doing wasn\u2019t just some worthless internet arguing.\n\nOvertime, they started gradually liking my comments more and more, and then one day, someone backed me up in an argument. I was SO EXCITED lol\n\nThen more Dems started joining in too. Then I started noticing more and more of them commenting and challenging these folks in threads I hadn\u2019t even been in.\n\nIt was like a domino effect. People just needed to not feel alone. And there is power in numbers.\n\nAnd even though our numbers in this town will always be only a fraction of the MAGAs, I\u2019m glad these people and their ignorant ideas and misinformation is being challenged more.\n\nA few times I\u2019ve also had people who self describe as moderate or apolitical messaging me to say I helped sway their view on something because they had never thought about it like that before, since the town is a Christian conservative echo chamber with with no diversity in viewpoints.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen some less extreme conservatives temper their mean comments toward liberals and Californians waaaaaaaaay down, even challenging others who used to say the same things they used to. \n\nIt\u2019s like liberals weren\u2019t suddenly some abstract boogeyman anymore - they \n were real people they knew, they were neighbors, business owners of their favorite taco truck, their pet sitter, etc. \n\nWe weren\u2019t hidden anymore, and that humanized us for some of them.",

Things have gotten worse since Trump came along. Only difference is that there are more Democrats around. We have meetings and are very active in getting good people voted in as many important positions as possible. School boards, PC'S, state representatives ,Judges. We have been successful and have come a long way. We know we still have a lot of work to do. But we will never stop. Because we know what will happen. Democracy will die.",

For instance, they've decided you don't have the right to play music at 400 decibels in the middle of the night, shout fire in a crowded movie theater, or use speech to incite violence.\n\nMany laws restricting the time in which demonstrations and other assemblies can be held are entirely constitutional according to the Supreme Court. The constitution itself makes up only a tiny portion of constitutional law.\n\nEDIT: Added two words ; and I forgot \"fire in a theater\" was only a hypothetical used in an old case and is not in any way established precedent or law.",

An increase of 10dB is a 10x increase in the energy of the sound waves. A 3dB increase approximately doubles the energy. Such scales make it convenient when comparing a very wide range of values. It allows us to put the sound produced by a butterfly flapping its wings and the sound produced by a rocket engine in the same scale without having to work with ridiculously small or large values. But it does make it less intuitive for casual discussion. \n\nAt 194dB sound stops being sound per se. It is effectively an explosive shockwave. There is a near perfect vacuum between the high pressure peaks of the sound waves. The high pressure peaks are 2x atmospheric pressure. Any more energy and you are increasing the destructive force that shockwave would produce. Loudness stops being a measurable thing at that point. 400dB would be 10^20 times more energetic. \n\nNuclear bombs are usually between 240dB to 280dB. 400dB is a trillion times more energetic. So it would just be a pretty massive explosion.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would very strongly agree - You do not have the right to play 400dB music in the middle of the night (or any time really).",

Seattle PD still refuses to do their jobs which has led to an increase of crime in certain areas where the protests were held. Public perception of the city changed quite a bit after the protests too due to the misinformation coming out about the protests. The cops definitely had a reminder that they work for us, but they're still throwing a tantrum about it three years later, and we didn't even get the change enacted that we protested for.",

The poll closed and a guy walked in just a bit after, wanting to submit his mail-in ballot. The site tender told him sorry, box is closed, please come back and submit tomorrow, we'll be open all day. Dude threw his ballot in the trash and walked out. Spoiled rotten trash who have had it too good for too long without having to do any work to maintain it.

I'm hoping this state doesn't manage to get further corrupted and ensnared by the GOP, they've been playing this game and winning in Wisconsin for far too long",

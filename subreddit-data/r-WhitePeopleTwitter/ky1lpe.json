What exactly are they going to do to stop us from using it? Sniff our packets for encrypted data? Encrypted data looks exactly like regular old binary data - the only thing that they could intercept would be the handshake, but the moment they fuck with that standard, engineers will just make a new encryption standard. Are they going to make certain kinds of encryption illegal? I'm curious how that interacts with the \"code is speech\" argument, but new encryption methods **will** be made.

Every trap would come complete with a ladder so they could climb back out and display their colors to the world when they emerged. Some of my most creative juices came from being berated at the bookstore where I worked, lol.",

Once one party, cop or criminal, decides to use their ability to take your life to control your actions, you have to either listen to them or fight back with your own lethal force if you want to survive AND serve your own will.\n\nEdit: This is why cops don't like you reaching quickly for things that they can't see, and why if you are non compliant and you do so there is a good chance you might get a gun drawn on you. \n\nIf they think you are non compliant, they are going to assume that you are reaching for something that will give you the ability to take the upper hand and serve your will. It is why even if I think my rights are being infringed upon, I am still going to comply because I would rather live and have the chance to fight it in court vs risk my life for eventual detainment either way.",

For me, reasonable gun ownership looks like someone trying to buy a gun, passing a federal background check, and then receiving their firearm. If we wanted to include some attempt at proving proficiency then I could be open to that as well.\n\nHowever, if your definition of reasonable gun ownership includes banning certain calibers or firearms, then I am not on board with that idea. Ultimately, this comes down to the several facts. \n\n1. Fully automatic weapons are already illegal to the vast, vast majority of people. Those with the ability to own automatic weapons are subject to government registries and unannounced inspections.\n\n2. If you are opposed to the power of semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15, realize that the vast majority of mass shootings are committed with handguns, which many people seem to be ok with. \n\n3. Many weapons are far more dangerous than many hot button weapons, but they aren't viewed as a threat because of how they look. A wooden lever action rifle chambered in .357 can hold 13 rounds and be fired extremely quickly to case massive damage. Many shotguns are semi-automatic and can be fired extremely quickly; imagine a shot gun's potential in a crowd. Many hunting rifles with wooden parts are the same as rifles that appear more militaristic, but they aren't viewed as dangerous either.\n\nI realize that I may be preaching to the choir here because you may happen to fully agree with me on these points while only having an issue with large numbers of any gun in general, but I like to mention these points because many people simply aren't aware of them. \n\nAlso, I agree that there are too many under-trained police. This may be the unpopular stance here, but this is why I believe that police departments should be given more funding so that we can increase the training regiment, do more thorough background investigations, and ultimately offer police more money for their dangerous jobs so that more people can apply for the job, including more qualified people who won't apply now because they pay frankly sucks. \n\nAnyway, those are just my opinions. I agree with the points you made, but I just wanted to expand upon them a bit. Also sorry for the novel, maybe you can tell that I'm interested in both of these topics lol.",

It is supposed to give those words weight, as it grants the people the power to wage war on the government, and keeps the government from having a monopoly on the power to cause violence. When the ability to cause violence is equal, so is the power within the country. Once the citizens no longer have the ability to form an insurgency, there is nothing stopping the government from granting the people the rights guaranteed by the constitution besides words.\n\nAnd for the \"the AR-15 cant stop an ICBM\" comments I know this will receive:\n\nA fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners and enforce \"no assembly\" edicts. A fighter jet cannot  kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband.\n\nNone of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation.

And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians.\n\nWhich is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.\n\nBUT when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out the window because now the police are out numbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.\n\nThe promise of being \"in\" with the dictator is no longer worth the threat on your life should you carry out those actions.\n\nIf you want living examples of this look at every insurgency that the  U.S. military has tried to destroy. They're all still kicking with nothing but AK-47's, pick up trucks and improvised explosives because militaries are just useless with this kind of stuff.\n\nMilitaries are meant for fighting other nations.

That is why I have decided that if I ever get a gun drawn on me and pointed at me and subsequently have orders shouted at me, im going to comply whether its a cop or a criminal. Because that is a fight that you cant win, and all that can result from non compliance is your death.\n\nBut there are plenty of situations where you can get your gun in your hands and be in a fair fight. For example, you see someone walking up to your car door at a stoplight and you get it in your hand to be ready, or you hear someone break in to your house. Or the person pointing a gun at you gets distracted.\n\nAnd it is also why cops don't like people quickly reaching for things they can't see. Because they know that if its a gun, the second that barrel is pointed at them they are screwed.",

He wanted to limit how many guns you could buy at a time (not even total, just at once) and make it so you had to report the gun stolen within 30 days or face a fine and jail time.  \nThey tore into him like he was a fucking tyrant and I believe none of it passed. So if your gun was used in a crime, and the cops come knocking, you can just say \"oh fuck, yeah my house got broken into six months ago, never reported my 5 guns stolen. My bad\"",

Mcdonald's will always have customers and most franchise owners only care about money they don't give a shit about to one or two people a week who go \"I'm never going back to McDonald's.\"",

If someone has committed a crime the police can't just let him walk away. \nThe second is there is 300 million police contacts annually, over 99% of which end peacefully, so really police do end the majority of conflicts with deescalation\nThose ones don't make the news though",

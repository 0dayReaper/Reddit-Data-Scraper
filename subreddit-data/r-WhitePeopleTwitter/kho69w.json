That's because all of the bad loans got swept away already in 2008. What's left? A lot of people nearing the end of 30-year $150K loans on half million dollar properties.\n\nThe bank issues loans on the prospect that, even if the people can't pay the loan off, the property is enough to keep them solvent, even if it's a tiny bit more hassle to collect by reselling it. But now housing prices have gone up so dramatically much that they'd rather have the property, since even after collecting on it, they've made a very tidy profit. This is why we *had* to regulate mortgage payment forgiveness and eviction moratoriums - people would be out on the streets right now.\n\ntl;dr: People defaulting on loans is the easiest way to transfer wealth from the poor and middle class to the absurdly stupidly wealthy now.",

Normal countries it\u2019s 10% or less.\n\nIn America, medical administration costs more than the military. And healthcare costs *double* all the *world\u2019s* militaries.\n\nYou\u2019re getting robbed, and it\u2019s not by the military industrial complex. Okay a little bit by them, but a lot by private healthcare.",

The number of times I've seen people say \"universal healthcare only works in those countries because they have fewer people so it's cheaper\" is too damn high.  I even saw Bill O'Reilly say that while sitting next to Jon Stewart, and even Jon Stewart couldn't come up with the obvious counterargument:\n\nWhen your country has 300 million people, yes it is more expensive to provide healthcare than a country with 30 million people, but you also have 10x the taxpayers.  And then there's the extra bargaining power of being larger, the economies of scale, and it really works out so that it is cheapest for the *largest* countries, and the most difficult and expensive for the tiniest countries.",

It is completely wrong. The PUAC/FPUC program in the CARES Act expanded the availability, length, and benefit amount of unemployment. Most importantly, UI benefits in the US were increased by $600/week, bringing the average UI benefits to over $900/week (though this varies by state), approximately equal to the average wage. The explicit plan of FPUC was to ensure that UI recipients earned the average wage.\n\nThis plan was MORE generous than NZ\u2019s wage subsidy and the Canadian UI plan (which is also often referenced). NZ provided a NZ$585/week wage subsidy to businesses, which was less than the country\u2019s NZ$1,300/week average wage (in other words, while the US wanted to have the unemployed earn the average wage, NZ short changed them). Additionally, NZ$585 is equivalent to US$415, so smaller than the US boost to UI benefits. The US PPP was that was similar to the NZ wage subsidy also limited salary reductions to 25% for workers making less than $100k/year, to avoid a drastic cut in salaries during the recession.\n\nAs for the Canada example that is also typically referenced: the C$2000/month payment was only for the unemployed. This is equivalent to ~$1600, so again less than the incremental $2600/month provided by the US.\n\nIf you want to attack the US program, it is the fact that FPUC ended on July 31. The fault for that lies with Republicans, so save your scorn for states that elected Republican senators, especially WI (2016), PA (2016), ME (2020), NC (2016 and 2020), MO (2016 and 2018), and FL (2016 and 2018). Without those narrow Republican wins, a renewed FPUC could have been passed Congress.",

She was one of the few that received a 1200 and a 600 and that's literally it, she didn't qualify for unemployment because she was 1099 and her boss was illegally not carrying unemployment insurance(or whatever it's called). Unemployment was and is still so broken and back logged, some people just get automatically denied for no reason, with multiple friends being denied with corporate jobs. This is Florida by the way. Also, we had a \"hiccup in the system\" and constant crashes on the website that either reset, manipulated somehow or completely lost the unemployment application and/or follow up paperwork. Fuck all these people that think the US did or is still doing a good job handling the pandemic and consequences from it. This is a complete shit show, typical of the US. \n\nSo yeah, all we got was 1800 and denial to unemployment payments. It seemed like the more well off you were, the more likely you were to receive assistance. \n\nI also lost my electricians job due to covid and had to get back in another industry, fucking my life up so I could pay rent (yes there was a stop on evictions, but those are gone and the rent and bills were piling up) \n\nI don't hate america.

The US has a whole separate unemployment benefit system that pays way more than a one-time payment of $600.\n\nYou can tell how many Redditors haven't actually lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits because they're only seeing the $600 free money they got for keeping their jobs. And they're still complaining about it.",

On top of that, $1200 per person, both working and unemployed plus $500 for each dependent.\n\nEvery post like this is acting like everyone just gets stimulus money while they are working everywhere but the US.",

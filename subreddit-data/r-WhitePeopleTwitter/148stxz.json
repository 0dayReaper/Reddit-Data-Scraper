Trump having more detail makes sense, because its his trial, but they gave him bright, kempt hair, chiseled jaw, normal skin tone, great posture, etc.\n\nI have literally never seen trump stand as straight as he is in the artist depiction. You know the way he usually stands, like a horse or something with his ass behind him.",

The reasons I\u2019ve seen so far why Dems are upset are: lack of decorum and respect for WH, it\u2019s going to be used as more fodder, children were present (?) which I guess for some politicians it\u2019s not a good look to defend drag shows, losing Independent voters etc etc It\u2019s about optics for Democrats and 2024. \n\nLeftists and many LGBTQ are supportive. Tho lesbians are really upset right now on the app, but that seems to be for many reasons. Twitter is a sh*tshow today and I can\u2019t wait to uninstall after Reddit comes back fully lol.",

Why do people only talk about respecting a flag, a government building etc when something happens they don't agree with. Lol I can't think of the last time anyone said how much they respect the WH. People are going to people.\n\nEdit: I've learned that there was also a very scantily clad man standing right next to her. Where's the outrage for that?",

We had a neighbor behind our apartment go out on his deck, fifteen feet from ours, and unload a magazine into the air. I was watching out the window while on the phone with 911 when he did it again. The operator heard it and said an officer is already enroute.\n\nUnexpectedly, about 5 minutes later a cop knocks on our door asking us to point out the apartment. We didn't really expect a response. I guess the operator hearing gunfire got them moving. I said I saw about 7 shots from a small caliber pistol, most likely a .25acp, maybe a .32, but it was dark and I was only going by sound. I described the guy and thanked the officer as he left.\n\nThere was a knock again about 20 minutes later from the same cops. He said they found the right guy and he was in custody. Just letting me know. He then said 'Good job on the weapon ID. We found a .25acp on him. It still smelled freshly fired. Also, he is a felon in possession. He'll be headed back to State.' \n\nAnd that's my feel-good story of how I took one shithead off the NYE gun celebration squad and sent him back to prison.\n\nedit: forgot to include that he broke rule #1. He talked to the cops and admitted to firing a pistol into the air. So, yeah, he deserved everything he got.",

Our neighbors started in March, almost every single day from March till late June. They would start around noon with just firecrackers constantly and then switch to mortar style and bottle rockets with more firecrackers mixed in when it got dark. Usually till 11-midnight. There were a few instances where they were lighting them off after 1AM and the cops were called but everyone just seemed to accept it. I'm also certain they took the first stimulus check and spent all of it on more fireworks (they had about 8-9 kids living there between 1/2 up to mid teens) because it slowed down right before those came and then really got out of hand after. Then one day it stopped, 4th of July came and we were dreading it but barely a thing, and I don't think they did it again since. It was torture for months but I guess we have a story out of it.",

I gave her some delicious sheep meat with her normal food and then she went to sleep. It was about 00:50.\n\nMy cat, however, 4 years old, heard the first firework and ran like Jerry from Tom inside my bed, shouting some random meow and quietly laying in the ground.\n\nAh, the new year saga.",

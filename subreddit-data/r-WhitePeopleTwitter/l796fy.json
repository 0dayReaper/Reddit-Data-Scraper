If the price goes down, it now costs less to give back that stock. This is called a short. Lenders charge to borrow stock, so the price difference needs to justify the cost.\n\nHedge funds make money if the stock **tanks**. They WILL put out fake news and opinion pieces and spread rumors through social media. They buy time on TV to have their falsehoods heard and believed. The worse the world feels about that company, the more money hedge funds make.\n\nShorting on this level bankrupts companies. That was literally the goal, to bankrupt AMC/Nokia/BlackBerry/GameStop. That's thousands of people out of a job, and a productive business is closed even though it's solvent.\n\n___\n\nWhat happens if the price goes up? Well, they need to return the stock. There is no alternative. Hedge funds buy it at market value and sign it over. What if the price is astronomical, like 100x higher? Sucks, shouldn't have bet it would go down.\n\nNow let's go further: what happens if there is no stock? Like, what if the due date comes but no one is willing to sell it to you? Uh, you need to offer above market value until someone gives in. This is what we're shooting for. These hedge funds have potentially unlimited loss. They will owe infinite money.",

The reason why they have power over people is because people have been conditioned to believe that finance is boring. Their ability to exercise this power over people is 100% contingent on people not knowing how this stuff works.\n\nDon't watch it if you don't have more than 2 mins to devote to something as important as this. That's a very self destructive attitude to take in regards to learning about the market. This 20 minute video is like a 4 year university course boiled down to 20 mins.\n\nAnd I don't mean that in an attacking way, so please don't take it that way.

Houses I've been into are horrifying, been punched in the face NUMEROUS times after bringing someone back from an overdose or just trying to help. I have never worked so hard -3 different agencies at once, 12 hour shifts going from one station to the next. Being mandated constantly, never seeing my kids, helping people who are ungrateful, subjecting myself to physical abuse, patients stalking me, cutting patients down from hangings, Neverending CPR. While I miss using my skills you truly couldn't pay me enough to do that job ever again. The PTSD from the calls will forever haunt me. That's payment enough. TREAT EMS BETTER!!!!!",

I'm sure there are other jobs with massive pay differences between here and there, but these are the only one popping in my head. \n\nEven our minimum wage is different than a lot of places, in Ontario it's $14 (mind you our cost of living is significantly high) but when I hear if servers being laid $2.50/hr and pretty much depending on tips, or minimum wage being $7 some places it boggles my mind how anyone can survive. I see the stories all the time of people working 40+ hours a week at 2 or 3 different jobs and still needing foodstamps. Can't go to the hospital when sick or injured because no health insurance and the simple hospital visit can bankrupt you, so they're just forced to work through it, it's just wild. \n\nI know Canada isn't without its own faults but it doesn't dominate headlines like America does. Hell, most news reported in Canada or written in Canadian Newspapers is about America so I see more of what's going on there than I do here.",

It\u2019s a rural area so of course it pays less.  \n\nI don\u2019t blame RAA or the local company, it\u2019s the industry as a whole.  This is the norm for them so I guess they don\u2019t see anything wrong with the pay.  I just think it\u2019s ridiculous that I make more money in a rural town working a desk job than your average Richmond EMT working all sorts of crazy hours &amp; situations.",

My son had to be transported via ambulance when he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and it cost us $4200 for a 25 mile trip.  \n\nThe EMTs talked to me and him the entire time telling us what was happening and why.  Diabetes is not something I had any familiarity with and up until that point, my boy had been very healthy and active.  If they were only making $15 an hour, they went way above and beyond.",

I was working more hours but I controlled my schedule completely and didn't have to answer to anyone. I just told the sales company yesterday that I'm taking a major step back in my availability with them because the appointments have been utter shit and it's embarrassing I'm making more with Uber and having a better quality of life.\n\nMany people are shocked when I tell them what I can make with ride sharing and if you have a decent car that is good on gas it can pay far better than many jobs (if you live in a decent city). The biggest thing is expenses and paying taxes instead of having them taken out. Just be smart and save at least 30% and your tax write off basically evens out your expenses and vehicle depreciation...most of the time your tax write off and savings on that is much better than a W2 at the same income.",

I\u2019ve been a driver since before the pandemic, but back then I was also working in a restaurant so I only drove in my off time (read: slow times). Since covid shut the restaurant I made driving my full time job. I make more in 20 hours than I did working 40+ at the restaurant. And I was making a bit above minimum wage then. They called me several times after they reopened but I very nicely declined each time.\n\nAlso, about the taxes, I\u2019m not sure what the standard mileage deduction is in your state, but here we get 57 cents for each mile driven while \u201conline\u201d (regardless if you\u2019re on a trip or not). So to everyone who might not be the type to meticulously track all your mileage and repairs and whatnot, in my case, the standard deduction more than covers the taxes I owe. I also get a bit of a refund like a normal job. \n\nThe only thing that\u2019s annoying is the people who bug me about getting a \u201creal job.\u201d They\u2019ll  helpfully offer a lead to a job that\u2019s say $18/hour and when I tell them I make more than that even after taxes, they\u2019ll just scoff like they don\u2019t believe it and say \u201cyeah but you need a REAL job.\u201d What??? These are the same people pointing out help wanted signs to me as we pass gas stations and fast food joints.

But then they keep squeezing blood from that stone, until eventually all of the compassion has been bled dry and that person burns out and no longer gives two fucks.\n\nWe strip-mine good will for profits and then leave behind craterous husks of what were once good and noble people. Then, if those people *ever* speak out, the profiteers call them greedy cynics who are just in it for the money, with corporate mass media gleefully participating in this character assassination (see OP) which serves to chill future speech on the matter from other such burnouts, forcing them to hide their real situations from the public eye and pantomime that everything is okay, further reinforcing public misunderstanding of the situation.",

I make it a point not to dox people (unless it's funny + publicly available, like McConnell's house being designated as a \"[garbage dump]( https://hummerous.tumblr.com/post/639521307602616320/lmao)\")\n\n\nI assume it got mass reported by the rightwing shitheads on r/tumblr, it happens\n\n\nI also got suspended for saying you should scalp nazis earlier that year, which was.. more justifiable, i think",

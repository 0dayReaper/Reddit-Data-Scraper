Not like the conservatives who have been calling for a boycott if a store has so much as a rainbow anywhere on premises. Or for a company for sending a SINGLE PACK to an individual to congratulate them on a life event. Those were totally all the Biden administration and Biden's evil masterminded plan he came up with somehow while simultaneously being a senile old man.\n\nDo I really need to put the /s on this comment?",

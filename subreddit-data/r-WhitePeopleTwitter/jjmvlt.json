Second, there has been a concerted effort to demonize taxes as ways politicians get rich at the expense of the populace for decades. Part of this process has been convincing poor and lower middle class earners that tax brackets are designed to gut paychecks and that if they continue to push for higher wages, it will cause them to lose more money each paycheck. Add this to union busting, decreased protections for employees in most states, keeping insurance tied to employment, and the gradual weakening of the public education system in many predominantly Republican states and you end up with a large group of people who are unsure what they even pay in taxes now let alone how they are used for public services and what a marginal tax rate even does.",

I told him that that made no sense, you can\u2019t make more and take home less, that is simply not possible with our progressive tax system. He argued that taxing him more, was un encourage him to make more. So I showed him via the IRS tax brackets and a calculator. We did it over and over again. He was silent for a solid minute, trying to make sense of it. I reaffirmed him with, just make as much as you want, you will both take home more and at the same time contribute more to society. He is a very smart guy, and witnessing his reality crash with his beliefs was very interesting.",

Under Biden, this marginal tax rate would be restored to the pre-tax cut rate of 39.6%. So you would be paying an extra 2.6% on the $10,000, or $260 more.\n\nSource: https://taxfoundation.org/joe-biden-tax-plan-2020/#Details",

It's not, the ammendment we are voting on just gives the state legislature the ability to set different brackets, it in no way sets those brackets or the rates within those brackets. It's like people magically believe that taxes can't be increased unless we vote for increased taxes, which is of course not true. \n\nYes Gov. Pritzker has laid out a proposed tax plan if the ammendment passes but that is separate from the amendment and not something we get to directly vote for. That plan would lower taxes for everyone making under 250,000 (albeit minimally, the most anyone will save is $65 per year) and modestly raise them for higher incomes. If you make 350,000 non-jointly, for example, you would pay about $2700 more per year than you would under the current system. \n\nThe most interesting part is that the top bracket ($750,000 single or $1,000,000 joint) is taxed at the top rate (7.99%) for all their income. Which does create a weird situation where jointly you'd rather make &lt;1,000,000 until you make more than 1,010,000, which is typically undesirable, but so small in this case that it's hard to believe it matters. So 0.1% of the population is trying to convince Republicans to pay more in taxes themselves rather than to tax the uber rich more. And Republicans are largely falling for it because \"taxes bad.\"",

You pay the lowest tax rate up to the limit of the lowest tax bracket, the second lowest tax rate up to the limit of the second lowest tax bracket, etc etc. \n\nNow that you know the secret, you'll be amazed by how many people who file taxes every year don't understand how it works - and how many politicians who absolutely do understand how it works deliberately lie to people to justify cutting the highest tax brackets' tax rate.",

So Todd in the break room saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want the raise because then it would bump me into the next tax bracket\u201d is talking out of his ass.\n\nIf you make $50K/year, as a single person, your money falls into 3 tax brackets. So you pay 10% tax on the first chunk, 12% on the next chunk, and 22% on the third. These are not cumulative, though, so if you make just $1 over the threshold of the next bracket, your tax is going to be $0.24 on that dollar (you need to make more than $84K a year to get to this next bracket). The rest of your pay will be taxed just like it was before.",

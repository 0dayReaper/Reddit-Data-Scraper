Been making pretty steady progress lately and people have been happy about the changes.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Its a video game (survival MMORPG) a bunch of Redditors and I have been working on for years! Sorta like a 2D Eve (except really not) finally in early access and the response has been really encouraging so far. \n\nWe're making this game as an attempt to create a new genre where the game world ends up facilitating a simulation of human society. Player's characters live in the game world and need to try to survive with the same limitations that people have in real life. Where technology can be invented by players to make their in-game life easier. Everything is player driven, we just provide the virtual environment. \n\nThis is our first attempt at creating a game like this.\n\n[**Here you can get access to the game, watch concept/gameplay videos**, and read about this player-driven survival space MMORPG](https://www.voidspacegame.com/)\n\nIt's currently available to play on PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and directly in the browser. Use the website to find a link to each platform when you go to Play Now.\n\nWe also have a subreddit r/voidspace. There you can find a link to discord where you can connect with the devs and the rest of the community.\n\n---\n\n^(Update: You can currently try the game for a few hours for free! Just be aware that this is a new feature and if we get overrun then we'll have to disable it temporarily.)",

She sat with us and had a few drinks and once the creep was gone we walked her out to a cab.",

The guy comes and sits next to her and she introduced me as her boyfriend. He looked dejected and left before ordering his first drink. \n\nEdit: hit save too soon.",

I had told the bartender that a guy who had just gone to the restroom was aggressively ruining my night, and I didn't really want to leave yet because it was my 22nd birthday and already sucked. He wanted to help but his girlfriend was there and had made a point of making out with him frequently to ward off women... so he made up a story about a mutual friend and invited me downstairs (staff area.) \n\nThe idea was to wait the guy out, hoping he'd leave. He didn't until almost the end of the night, so the bartender tried his best to salvage my night by bringing me free drinks.\n\nI had left my jacket over the bar stool... My car keys were in it. By the time it was safe to come upstairs, the keys were gone. I knew immediately they were stolen, but to this day I don't know who wanted to spite me worse- the guy who waited all night or the jealous girlfriend. *Both* were gone, and the bartender said his gf didn't believe he was just trying to be helpful.\n\nHe did make sure my car didn't get towed while waiting to get re-keyed, and helped me vainly search the place just in case. \n\nI sort of felt worse for *him*- no good deed goes unpunished, and I know he felt guilty that he might have been the reason AND his gf undoubtedly compounded it \ud83d\ude44",

At one point, she finally got up and moved seats and the guy followed. \n\nSuddenly these two girls, about mid twenties, comes up to the man and calls him out and says something like, \"why are you harassing this woman when she clearly doesn't want to talk to you?\" The woman jumps in and says, \"oh, no, thank you, but this is my husband. I'm just mad at him.\"",

I called my (ex) bf at the time and he was pretty much \"uh what do you want me to do about it I'm at work\". I just kept driving until I lost him in a grocery store parking lot.

I sure as hell don't flip off shitty drivers now and also keep the police non emergency number in my phone just in case.",

I had drinks with some friends (both girls and guys) one evening and some random dude and his gal, who he claimed was his wife, had like inserted themselves into our group convos while we were all out on the bar patio. (I say claimed it was his wife because we are 99% sure she was a hired escort for multiple reasons).\n\nIt was fine, he was a little obnoxious from drinking but not so much that any of us were really bothered by it. He wasn\u2019t from the area (Portland) and kept asking us which strip clubs were the best and if any of us had or knew where to get coke. We informed him we didn\u2019t have any advice on where to find the drugs but we gave him club suggestions. Once we moved onto some topics they had nothing to contribute to the two of them went in to play video poker. \n\nAll was fine and we didn\u2019t interact with either of them again throughout the evening, right up until the end. All of us had started going our separate ways for the night and I happened to be the last one in our group to dip. This was back when I still smoked, so I was back out on the patio finishing a smoke and minding my own business on my phone when homeboy comes out, sees me, asks if he can bum a smoke. I say sure here take two Im heading out. He says \u201cno no, stay come on have another drink with me.\u201d I say \u201cnah that\u2019s alright, I\u2019ve had my 2 drink limit for the evening and I\u2019m about to drive.\u201d He says \u201coh come on, please?\u201d I say \u201cisn\u2019t your wife inside waiting for you?\u201d He seems to have forgotten that\u2019s what he told us she was, stutters a bit and says something like \u201coh she left early...come on stay for one more drink, I\u2019ll buy\u201d Ignoring the fake wife thing, I chuckle a bit and say \u201cthe paying for it isn\u2019t the issue man I\u2019m done drinking and it\u2019s time for me to leave. I told my bf I\u2019d be home by midnight.\u201d By this point I\u2019m already walking backwards towards the parking lot. The part I wasn\u2019t expecting, and the #1 reason I think his \u201cwife\u201d was an escort he blew it with, was him completely changing tone, all of a sudden seeming much more alert and creeping towards aggressive. He says \u201cI will pay you $100 to stay and have a drink with me.\u201d Dead serious stare and I froze on the spot for a moment just taken aback by the offer/demand/threat? \n\nI was a few yards away at this point and I just hollered back \u201cNOPE\u201d and kept staring at him while I got in my car. I kept visuals on him as I left the parking lot, did an extra lap of the building after taking a loop through the nearby residential areas, and called one of my buddies that had been there on my way home. I said \u201cpretty sure that fucking dude got abandoned by his escort and he for real tried to buy my time and was so persistent so I\u2019m calling you in case I don\u2019t make it home you have my last known location. I drove around the neighborhood to make sure I wasn\u2019t being followed but just in case, I\u2019m coming up 26 towards Sylvan. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m home.\u201d \n\nI hear many men talk about how it\u2019s become *so hard* to talk to women because we almost always reject them, and sure there are individual situations where guys with genuinely good intentions get shot down and it hurts the ego a bit, but unfortunately for us, every single one of those guys COULD be dangerous below the surface and it\u2019s guys like the one in my story and pretty much every example on r/niceguys that are the root of the issue. I\u2019m married now and have reasonable self defense skills and strength to take down people bigger than me but it honestly doesn\u2019t make me feel any less haunted by situations like this or wary of people I don\u2019t know",

Turns out they were really nice and had noticed my bf had been gone awhile, they offered to go check on him, and stayed and chatted when he came back, then left when friends came.  But I was pretty scared at first.",

Where we lived, the demographics for people who frequented dance clubs was a 60/40 split between drunk college girls and young marines who were even more drunk than the girls, which was honestly not a fun mix. \n\n\nThe few times I went with her I saw guys backing girls up into corners, grinding on them even when the girls tried to get away, even copping a feel when the girl was screaming at them to stop, it was all just kind of accepted behavior. One night a guy who was dancing with my roommate grabbed her top and pulled it down to expose her breasts in front of all his friends and no one at the bar gave a shit. We had to hide in the bathroom and call a guy friend to come pick us up because the guys would not leave us alone. \n\n\nSometime even having a guy with you wouldn\u2019t help. One night I was driving home with my boyfriend at the time in the car after going to see a band. A pick up truck full of marines followed us and kept trying to get me to pull over while yelling \u201cwhy would you be with that zero when you could get with a hero?\u201d over and over. It was honestly terrifying. This was all early 2000\u2019s and no one ever seemed to give a shit about how these guys were treating girls. Glad to see that at least you try to keep them safe.",

I told him to get off and he became more violent so i used hands on him just once and he and his buddy ran off..so once i got the girl calmed down i got her to ring her dad who said he would come pick her up. So whilst waiting with her for her dad and listening to the litany of how much of a doosh her boy was a police van pulled up.\n\nApparently the charming gent had told them just around the corner that i had smacked him. Despite his girlfriend explaining what had happened they threw me in the back of the van, i asked them if we could stay there for just a few minutes until her dad came as boyfriend was clearly waiting over the road..they cuffed me and away we went, hope that girl was ok.",

I just found out she was cheating on me after I drove 1.5hrs across town to pick her up from a late shift. I was pissed and didn\u2019t want to be in the car with her for another hour driving back home and her telling me I deserved it. \n\nI got out the car and screamed she needed to leave me alone and started walking away. She followed me yelling some stuff and within 15-30 seconds 7 people piled out of the darkness from nowhere and surrounded me yelling at her to \u201cleave the girl alone!\u201d Two guys started approaching her, maybe to fight? I told them I was ok, I just didn\u2019t want to be with her, thanked them and shared flapjacks a local greasy spoon. I don\u2019t know where tf those people came from at such an ungodly hour, but I\u2019m forever thankful.",

The amount of relentless guys aggressively hitting on women was absurd. \n\nMy usual tactic if the girl seemed really uncomfortable was just to make eye contact with her and a quick \"Hey, you ok?\" They always understood exactly what I was asking, and we'd make the guy leave if the girl said no, she wasn't. \n\nI'm sure me actually working at the place made me more of a \"safe\" person in her eyes, but I bet a similar tactic wouldn't be awful in some bar or wherever else you see someone getting harassed. Just make sure that if the girl says she's fine, don't hover around to \"make sure\", because then you're being creepy.",

Disregard anything anyone says about how hitting on women is creepy and how you should never do it. That being said these are things to avoid when approaching a woman.\n\nDo NOT: \nComment on her body, how hot she is, how she makes you horny etc etc\n\nStare at her before you speak to her\n\nStare at her boobs or anything but eyes while you talk to her\n\nInvade her personal space, guideline is about 3.5 feet\n\nDO NOT TOUCH HER\n\nDO:\nCompliment her style, her skills, something about her you noticed other than her looks. Maybe call her pretty at the very most\n\n\nMake small talk first\n\n\nAbort if she is giving one word answers, doesn\u2019t look at you when she talks to you, or mentions her boyfriend or that she\u2019s just plain not interested. Say \u201cok no prob\u201d and LEAVE\n\n\nAsk her for coffee or something small\n\nYou WILL get rejected, very often, and sometimes it may be humiliating, but it\u2019s ok, the world isn\u2019t over and you\u2019re still alive. Go out and try again. It only takes one girl to say yes and for her to match your personality to get that relationship you\u2019ve always wanted.\n\n\nAnd with this you never have to worry about being called a creep ever again. You\u2019re welcome and try to meet that girl",

Also, maybe the victim doesn't want to take the stand, and his testimony may be the only evidence.\n\nA five year sentence for an 84-yar old could mean he lives the rest of his life behind bars.  The victim's family might be fine with that, on balance.",

([article](https://www.wnem.com/2023/06/13/former-flint-area-priest-sentenced-sexually-assaulting-5-year-old/)) \n\nHe got the year (with over a month time served for... reasons) in exchange for a guilty plea that also dropped *other* charges against him. The other charges included that he repeatedly assaulted another boy over the span of 5 years while the kid was at parochial school. This event was in 1987, and the 5 year span was between 1995 and 2000.\n\nSo this wasn't one year for one rape. It was one year for at least a decade of systematically abusing multiple children. How any judge or prosecutor thought that one year was sufficient for this monster is beyond me.\n\nEdit: Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Brian S. Pickell",

These are not analogous. But they always make the comparison. Why?\n\nWell. The Catholic Church commissioned a report. If you google \"how many Catholic Priests are pedophiles\" it will heavily populate the results. The report will say 4%. The problem? All the data was supplied from the Catholic Church by diocese self reporting. Probably to arrive at a 4% number which is in line with the general population. You see, Catholics say there are no more pedophile priests than occur in the public. As if that makes it better. They then point to teachers and how many of those are convicted of sex crimes. You see, to Catholic apologists, there never was an issue. How could Catholics keep pedophiles out of the clergy if they occur in that same percentage in the public realm? It's really a problem with society. I mean, take public school teachers, they will say as diversion from the horrendous toll of the Catholic Church sex abuse scandals.\n\nHowever, in order for the school teacher percentage and the priest percentage to be analogous, there would have to be a massive international organization aiding and abetting pedophile teachers moving them around, and allowing them to abuse over and over and over again. As the Catholic Church did. In order to be analogous, in fact, the head of that organization would have to be aware of the abuse, as every pope has been aware. \n\nIn fact, if the percentage of pedophile priests was more than 4%, it would mean the numbers of abused children would be exponentially worse. Because one priest abused over and over, if the percentage were even 5%, then the victims would be multiplied greatly. At 8%, it would be horrifying.\n\nGalileo wept.",

I'm a former conservative Catholic and I listened to the bullshit for years.\nThe first time I heard the comparison was from Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingritch in the 90s (hopefully Newt will follow Rush to the great beyond soon). They've been white washing for 30+ years because political conservatives and the catholic church share the same donor base, and Rush was their useful troll until social media came along. Conservatives consistently claimed the accusations were a cash grab by phony victims. If any priest was actually a pedophile it was because the church was infiltrated by godless satan worshipers duping innocent catholic leaders. The church quickly dropped that last line as soon as victims started winning lawsuits-- it sounded too much like an admission. At that point they focused their efforts on hiding money.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's always about good old $$. The catholic church is essentially a tax-free corporation that needs to make its numbers, and they can only do it by convincing the flocks to believe they're under attack from Satan and liberals (the same thing in their world). It increases parishioner donations every time it's tried, with the added benefit of distracting people from where the real pedophiles are. Since conservatives share the church's goals, they'll walk hand and hand down that red brick path of big fat lies and bags of cash.",

The events were quite some time ago in 1987. Probably was hard to get evidence. The guy entered a plea deal and in exchange for pleading guilty they dropped some other charges for a child he allegedly sexually assaulted multiple times that was a student at religious school the pedo worked at. This article I\u2019ll link it sums it up somewhat. \n\nhttps://www.wnem.com/2023/06/13/former-flint-area-priest-sentenced-sexually-assaulting-5-year-old/?outputType=amp",

He has to register as a sex offender and complete sex offender treatment, which puts him at the highest level of probation supervision until he's about 89 years old. Assuming he survives a year of county as an 84 year old.\n\nThis will very, very, very likely put him under state supervision until he dies rather than re-traumatizing a victim after 40 years for a case that has a really high chance of acquittal.",

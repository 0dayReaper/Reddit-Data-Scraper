You get what you're willing to pay for. I'm in a deep South red state and a first year teacher makes almost 1/3 more than a first year cop. [Starting pay at NYPD is $42,500](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/careers/police-officers/po-benefits.page), with 60 college credits or two years of military service; [starting salary for a teacher in NYC with a bachelor's degree and no experience is $57,845 and $65,026 with a master's](http://teachnyc.net/about-our-schools/salary-and-benefits). You can make a lot more money without becoming a cop, so the people you get are often the ones who can't for some reason.",

You're thrown into a job where your first call might be a Karen making a scene in a Wendy's parking lot and your second is an armed robbery. You're constantly on edge. You've got a 1 year old at home, and you're always gone, so your wife never gets a break either. Your entire household is a stress fest and your job is a stress fest. What human being isn't going to be unpredictable, irrational, and angry?\n\nWe want cops to be smart. Calm. We want them to de-escalate situations. Giving them a fuckton of overtime is NOT the way you get a human being to act this way REGARDLESS of career. It's not healthy.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The situation with the police here is unacceptable and we need massive reform. But in order to reform properly we all need to take a very critical look at our argument and inject it with empathy. We're dealing with humans, not fully armed robots.",

It\u2019s 24/7 training in a specialized field (no general education). Is 12 weeks enough?\nProbably not.\n\n26 weeks is becoming the standard in most jurisdictions, plus requiring a 2-year degree to retain your job and a bachelors for sergeant or lieutenant promotions. In addition to that academy training, there is a field training period where you ride and train with a senior officer. Those can last from 90 to 360 days depending on the department.",

Thankfully a girl who was in several of my classes saw the whole thing and stopped to make sure I was ok after 4 other officers showed up. I\u2019m white btw, but I\u2019ve had a distrust of police since that incident (10 years ago) and I can\u2019t even imagine what it would be like being a minority it that situation.

It occurred to me maybe they'd run my plates and I didn't want to deal with it, so my girl and I got out and sat on the steps, nice evening, chatted a little. \n\nNo sign of activity, so I went back to the car, put my hand on the handle, and the whole parking lot lit up, two cop cars raced up and blocked me in, 12 cops leveled shotguns and sidearms at us and demanded we lay face down on the ground.\n\nAnyway, we did. And then cuffed in the back of a patrol car I finally explained things. They got the papers out of the glovebox and eventually uncuffed us and let us go, actually apologized but told me I really needed to get the thing squared away (I'm white, btw). I never did get another date with that girl.",

At the end of every quarter our office manager would be in a frantic spending spree for anything in the office even if we didn't need it. I asked why and the answer was if we didn't spend it then we would get less the next year and we don't know if anything will change the next year that will require us to need that amount of money. Basically, better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.",

No one wants to be the police chief who orders no helmets before a cop dies from a rock to the head. \n\nSo you get regular cops in paramilitary clothes making people nervous? So the crowd starts getting unruly \n\nSo then everyone is on edge and you get a riot.",

I feel like a lot more people would support it if they understood this point.\n\nIt does. Given when \"defund\" means something else when referring to Planned Parenthood:\n\n* [\"\u201cDefunding\u201d Planned Parenthood, Title X, and You\"](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/defunding-planned-parenthood-title-x-and-you) -- Planned Parenthood\n\n* [\"Trump's Title X rule defunding Planned Parenthood yet another blow to low-income women\"](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-title-x-rule-defunding-planned-parenthood-yet-another-ncna1045471) -- MSNBC\n\n* [\"The new Trump plan to defund Planned Parenthoood\"](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/18/17367964/trump-abortion-planned-parenthood-defund) -- Vox\n\n* [\"H.R.3134 - Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015\"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3134/text) -- Congress\n\nThe word \"defund\" doesn't change meaning just because of what you want to defund. The English language is full of billions of words we can find another for what we need: \n\n* \"reorganize\"\n\n* \"rebuild\"\n\n* \"renovate\"\n\n* \"revamp\" \n\n* \"refocus\"",

Essentially you would need the police and the appropriate healthcare provider.\n\nAs some one that opposes a large number of social programs increasing the resources available for people in these categories ranks top on the list of things that I believe the government should be involved with.  Primarily, I believe that we have a major mental health problem with a large number of these people.  The inability for your friends and family to force medical treatment on those that desperately need it is a tragedy.  I firmly believe that a large number of people could be rehabilitated or at a minimum live by a much better standard of living, and I think we are failing them miserably.\n\nThe failed institutions of the past severally limit progress on this topic and it\u2019s a shame because I think it could make a big difference in the world we live in.",

But you have to finish it within 5 years years or you're let go. \n\nI actually like this approach because you're getting some real world, hands on experience with your courses. \n\nHere's a good example. I have a friend that's a cop and took crime scene investigation. One evening in class they were doing blood splatter analysis (side note, this class room is freaking awesome. They literally let the teacher splatter red paint and recreate crime scenes). Ther next day she got called to a scene and was able to apply what she learned the night before",

This is like the equivalent of a Sheriff I guess, but with less arrest powers and less 'tools' (I only had a baton). My sole jurisdiction was hospitals since I worked for the provincial healthcare authority.\n\nWe only had two weeks of training, but a solid 3/4s of that was legal training and de-escalation techniques. After we completed the provincial peace officer training, our employer, the province, had us do another week of de-escalation training. \n\nI've been in an uncountable number of violent situations, but 4/5 times I was able to control the situation by...get this...TALKING. One of my instructors was clear about this- \"Your mouth is your greatest weapon.\" Terrible pick-up line sure, but it's legit in any sort of security or law enforcement work. The fact is, people are people, and whether you're dealing with a violent schizophrenic or someone drugged out of their minds, you can usually talk them into compliance if you're willing to take the time and show some empathy. \n\nNot saying there hasn't been times myself or my colleagues have had to do 'take-downs'. Sometimes, some people are too far over the edge to de-escalate. I was lucky that in my case, I almost always had a partner or two to help in controlling people so we could handle people with knives and other weapons without anyone getting injured. I can't imagine what it'd be like in the US where you have to worry about people carrying guns.\n\nAnyway, point I want to make is- Police absolutely need more training in de-escalation techniques and emotional intelligence. If anything, it's the most important skill they can learn.",

You then serve a two-year probationary period, in which you\u2019re paired with an experienced mentor officer. Get paired with a bad egg to start with and it\u2019s a self-perpetuating negative cycle. \n\n*the Met\u2019s apprentice route is three years but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a degree combined with on-the-job learning, rather than a specific training programme that lasts three years.",

The existence of the military colleges do support that the answer is yes for a non trivial number, but there are other factors that come into play such as it's paid for with service and the job is somewhat different. I'm curious to hear genuine answers please.",

The vast majority of policemen will go through their entire career without ever being shot at, quite a lot of them will never discharge their weapon outside of a firing range. More cops die on duty from heart attacks than from shootings.\n\nSo with that correction to your flawed premise in mind; it's a fairly well paying career with low to moderate risk, that in the past and hopefully again in the future carries a certain social prestige and you get to genuinly help people.\n\nIt's worth noting that what's being suggested here is hardly an innovative concept. In much of europe the police academy has been a 3-4 year bachelor for decades and plenty of people still sign up.",

You'd get rid of the problem of police forces attracting violent people to the job because nobody chooses to be a cop.  Everyone would have a better understanding of the law and the public would better relate to the police - they would either have been a cop, or they would have multiple family members on the force.\n\nYou'd have some professional police who make a career of it, but the majority of patrolmen would be conscripts who would be rotated out before they had a chance to develop \"us vs. them\" feelings towards the public.",

Queer people also have to contend with the fact that many of us have direct experience of having persistent negative experiences with people who stand behind a badge.\n\nWhat should have happened is the crowd should have beat their asses and sent them packing.

There's no way around that no matter how hard you try.  At a high enough level of competition it is no longer about inclusiveness and its about physical competition.  That's like &lt;1% of athletes and you need to leave that realm alone otherwise it makes the entire rest of your argument seem weak because it makes you seem like an unreasonable person.  Plus, even if it was allowed at the highest level, it's only going to HURT the trans cause because you know any cis woman that loses in high level competition to a transwoman is going to be resentful and you know bigots are going to use it as endless ammunition to keep fighting their culture wars.",

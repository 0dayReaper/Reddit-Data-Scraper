I got an A but I'm still not sure what decade I was dressing as.",

I never mentioned it to mom until the family decided it was appropriate for their 11yo son to push my 7yo daughter and hold her down while calling her a bitch in our driveway. They showed up at my door because the son was scratched in the process. Went ahead and showed them video of the son antagonizing my kids with audio, and ohp, by the way, we caught this and this and this and this each day last week at 1am while your daughter used our yard as a quiet escape route. \n\nDaughter immediately called me a bitch and the family won\u2019t make eye contact anymore. \n\nI\u2019ll be keeping my side part and my skinny jeans. And my mouth shut until I have a reason not to.\n\n\nEdit to add: teen came with mom to our house to confront us about the sons scratch. She hit my window, yelled at my dogs for barking after she hit the window, and told me I was a bully (and other things) for telling the family to get off my property if they were just going to defend their son despite actual video and audio evidence of him coming into our yard, shoving my daughter to the ground and pinning her there, all unprovoked. She had been playing with another neighbor girl and they\u2019d asked him to leave them alone. I told both girls to stay in our yard if he was bothering them, thinking it would help get him to leave. It didn\u2019t.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to come to my house, call me a bully and a bitch when I\u2019ve done nothing to you, why would I keep your secrets? You don\u2019t want them known, stay out of my yard and off the cameras that help monitor it.",

When you arrange the focal points on a canvas (in this case, the canvas is your entire body), you want to guide the eye in a melodic, dynamic pattern. If all the focal points are in the center, the eye just goes straight up or straight down and doesn\u2019t have to appreciate the different colors, shapes, and textures. Get that label to the side, an accessory like a purse or a watch, maybe some fashionably mismatched shoes, and you\u2019ve built a pathway for the eye to follow that essentially takes the viewer on a tour of the canvas. It happens quickly and often unpredictably, but it\u2019s still effective. \n\nIt\u2019s a little pseudo-sciencey, but it\u2019s how people have been doing art for a long time now and we just know from experience that it works.",

So artists exploit that to guide the audience experience as they wish.",

You can acknowledge how terrible the church has been while still being convinced of your own faith at the same time. Nobody is going to force you to leave but by the same time acting as if this isn\u2019t a problem or there\u2019s been enough reform goes against the teachings of Catholics in general to help those who cannot help themselves. \n\nI just don\u2019t get why these people feel the need to be caricatures",

You talk about the Church and being Catholic at all, and people start pointing to this issue. Or start talking about how they left the Church over this issue as a final straw. It's a very understandable defensive action when you *know* the Church was and is wrong over how they handled things but also still believe in the general community and theology of the Church itself. Especially when you're on the more liberal side of the spectrum.",

But a few things don\u2019t add up:\n\nThing the First: Burisma Guy isn\u2019t the one claiming he has the recordings, it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s Sen. Chuck Grassley making the claim.\n\nThing the Second: IIRC Burisma Guy was unceremoniously fired and accused of all sorts of malfeasance, including bribery, so he\u2019s not exactly a reliable source.\n\nThing the Third: A search for news about this whole brouhaha only brings up articles from right-wing sources like the NY Post, Washington Times, Fox, Washington Examiner, etc.\n\nThing the Fourth: Fox News is taking the story further, claiming that Grassley got all this information from an FBI form used to record reports of confidential sources. That particular report was mentioned last week as some sort of \u201csmoking gun,\u201d but no one but a handful of GOP senators has seen it and the FBI decided it wasn\u2019t worth following up on since it was all second-or third-hand info.",

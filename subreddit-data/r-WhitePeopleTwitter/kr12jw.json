Could be held back if the popular streaming services don't have pretty good APIs but seems like it could have a pretty good beta version out in like a week if they do.\n\nEdit:  Well, looks like all the major streaming services shut down their public apis...  that sucks.  Turns this from a quick easy app into a nightmare to keep working for more than probably a couple of days and still a nightmare to get to that point.  I'm out.",

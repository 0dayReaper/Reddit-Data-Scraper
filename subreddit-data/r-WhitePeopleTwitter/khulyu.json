Yeah I was angry, but I didn't do anything other than say that's fucking bullshit to the person I was dealing with, they called a manager over who was just as useless and rude, and I said this is fucking ridiculous, then all the sudden I feel a tap on my shoulder it's securities telling me I got to leave, when they escorted me out they said don't come back for 30 days, I told them to go fuck themselves I'm closing my account, and I never paid any of those overdraft fee, or at least the account was in the negative when I went to another bank.",

Anyway, I had went and checked my balance at the atm to make sure my check was there. It showed me the balance it should have been, so I went and made a couple small purchases. They put an overdraft fee on both purchases. I was in no danger of overdrafting with my current balance, so I became suspicious of the activity. When I went to the bank they told me I had overdrafted before it was deposited and they were sorry, but they couldn't do anything. When I disputed this, she showed me timestamps of the purchases and the deposit, and gave me an apologetic look. I pull out my paper receipt from the atm that has the time stamp of when I got the inquiry, showing there was a balance. Then the receipts from the purchases. The purchase receipt timestamps matched. The deposit on the bank's statement showed a much later time than my atm balance receipt. My deposit should have gone in at roughly the same time each week, but I noticed there would be hours of discrepancy from week to week. With proof in hand I called them out on it. I told the manager woman I was talking to that it looked like they were changing the timestamps on my deposits in order to force overdrafts. I request a printed copy of my account history. When she gives it to me, I notice 5 instances of timestamp discrepancy, including the one I was arguing. Each time it occured, I had overdrafts. She apologized and refunded all the overdrafts in the statement, 11 total. $385 during a time when I was hungry. I switched banks.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Bank switched timestamps. I had paper proof, got refund. Switched banks.",

It is extremely important that you are confident and respectful with it because you don\u2019t want to be fearful of it if you ever needed to use it. There are many great videos and resources for beginners to learn all about safety and different training. If you ever have any questions, feel free to shoot me a message",

They often took multiple drops since they tend to go cock eyed in the downward drop and lose a lot of energy. Then the blade can go caty wampus and get stuck on the spine and not really cut. \n\nI think whatever queen was last guillotined took 3 or 4 drops. \n\nI think someone basically said \"it's a feature\" in noble speak in a play/classic book I've read. It was something like \"the death is so bad because you're locked in, stuck there knowing it's going to kill you, but you don't know if it's going to be fast or a half dozen cuts like the last beheading you saw and cheared at last year. You're only aware that you're going to die, that shits being thrown and yelled at you, and that more likely than not it's going to hurt a lot\".",

You guys had nearly half of the voting population asking for 4 more years of this garbage, and if Trump made any effort to not be an enormous piece of shit he would've probably won this one with how close it was. Those people are cultists.\n\nWhat you're heading toward is a civil war, not a revolution. Revolution would require citizens to work together, not have half of them purposely running the country into the ground just so they can freely continue to be egoistic racist fucks in a cult.   \n\nAnd in the hopeful future where citizens as a whole all agree that they went too far, this would get fixed by simply not electing GOP morons to power. The tools to \"overthrow\" an abusive government are already there, you just have half the country willingfully not using it because they agree with the state it's in.\n\nFor now, voting, being politically active and voicing your disagreements however you can, like many people are already doing is the only solution. \n\nThe fact that all the Trump bullshit to try and stop democratically elected Joe Biden from taking the White House seat has been a terrible failure just goes to show that the tools are here and that these people can't stop the process of kicking them out of power.   \nYou cannot compare that to a whole country being governed by a king and having no options other than going to war together against those in power.",

But I wouldn\u2019t judge anybody else for doing so.  I love video games.  Plus it\u2019s a hobby that encourages people to stay inside.  Tf should people do with $600?",

The government doesn't expect you to live off of it, they expect you to buy stuff to keep the economy going. The unemployment money / increase is what's supposed to help you survive.\n\nRight? I mean it's hard to believe this many people would be blatantly mistaken so I'm open to the idea that it could be me that's missing something...",

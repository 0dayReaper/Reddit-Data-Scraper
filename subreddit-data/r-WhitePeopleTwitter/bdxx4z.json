The IRS sent me a letter earlier this year about the mistake, saying I have to pay the correct amount plus interest, along with an underpayment penalty, iirc it was 20% of the total owed. They sent instructions for setting up a payment plan if needed (as well as helpfully explaining that amounts over $10 million need to be split across two checks lol). \n\nThe IRS is surprisingly tolerant of mistakes, just not of fraud",

Something like that. It's basically an incentive to double check yourself and to correct it ASAP if you notice a mistake. Also bear in mind the commentor above underpaid by $12k, that's a pretty big mistake. Most people pay less than that total I think, let alone underpay by that amount.\n\nFWIW, though they won't pay you an underpayment penalty, you can file tax returns for previous years and get tax returns even if you miss the deadline. I think the \"tax day\" is actually just the due date for you to pay owed taxes. If you're sure you're getting a return I think you can file it basically whenever. There might be a limit to how many years you can wait idk.",

I had an IRS agent with me 8 hours a day for 2 weeks straight going through 20+ years of poorly kept hand written records. \n\nStill ended up with a 100k ass blast from Uncle Sam, and the repayment terms are NOT friendly.\n\nEdit: dear ppl digging through my post history, it's a family business open nearly 40 years. It's just easier to say it happened to \"me\", ya dig? \n\nWe're supposed to inherit it in a few years, I'm freaking terrified.\n\nEdit: yikes.  It negligence not fraud. Small mistakes over a very long time that were never corrected. It turned out bad and I only based on the payments being made and how long they are paying them. Maybe they are paying double/early payments I don't exactly know, but it wasn't a pleasant experience at all. Very small business, 150-300k revenue I'd guess?\n\nEdit again: I just wanted to say thank you to all of the people who responded with great advice. I'm really taking it all in, thank you.\n\nEdit for the last: I asked my wife how far back they reviewed. It was 30 fuckin years. Now, they \"reviewed\" that, I'm not saying it had anything to do with their payments but they went back THAT far. I'm talking paper records that were water damaged crispy type stuff. Unreal.\n\nSo, the paperwork they kept was FANTASTIC but they were doing SOME things wrong for 30 years without a hiccup. Hence the payment, and yes they are paying double just to get it over with. 50k fine, not 100k.",

Also didn't pay taxes for like three years (not proud, just was irresponsible as a freelancer). Had to pay it back, but again - no prison.

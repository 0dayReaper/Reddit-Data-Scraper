The more successful his competition is --- the more money he makes, because he always gets a cut.\n\nAND, in addition to getting a cut of their profits, he puts those companies in a position where they NEED the Amazon platform to just EXIST.

                            "comment": "In terms of inequality, this gets into rate of return on capital vastly outpacing economic growth in the states, and regularly being in the double digits yearly. As the saying goes - takes money to make money, and when you have billions you can make *a lot* of money just by having that much money.\n\n&gt;\tThe problem with having billions of dollars in wealth, most of which is held in assets and investments, is that it compounds and grows exponentially. Just investing that money in the stock market would yield an annual return of 10 percent on average, and even more in recent years. Which is why all but one of the world\u2019s 20 wealthiest tech figures have seen their net worth surge by billions of dollars in the ten months of 2019 alone, per Business Insider. And the only one who didn\u2019t hit that growth threshold was not even a Giving Pledge signatory: It was Jeff Bezos, who shelled out a record-shattering sum in his divorce settlement and still managed to remain the world\u2019s richest person.\n\n&gt;\tIt can be hard to visualize just how fast the money grows when you\u2019re starting out with tens of billions in principal, but consider these numbers: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s net worth has increased by about 40 percent this year alone, dumping an additional $22.4 billion onto his personal pile in 2019, according to Bloomberg. That brought his sum total to $74 billion, despite some of the most aggressive Giving Pledge commitments of the cabal. Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates\u2019s onetime right hand at Microsoft, has long been one of the world\u2019s richest people. But the $53 billion he has to his name in 2019 makes him twice as rich as he was at the beginning of 2017. Even Bill Gates himself, whose reputation has been cemented around his philanthropic foundation and his creation of the pledge, gives away about $5 billion a year in grants, yet maintains a net worth that increased by $18 billion in 2019 alone.\n\n&gt;\tThe profound inadequacy of the Giving Pledge as a tool of wealth distribution has even been admitted by many of the signatories themselves. Telecommunications billionaire Leonard Tow recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the whole enterprise. Tow and his now-deceased wife Claire signed the pledge in September 2012 and, in an open letter to Gates at the time, wrote tellingly that they \u201cnever believed that the wealth we accumulated was truly ours.\u201d Honored at a philanthropic ceremony last month, Tow said that he plans to give away all of his fortune with the exception of \u201cmodest provisions\u201d for family members. He then confessed that Gates\u2019s philanthropy pact hasn\u2019t been \u201cgrowing as rapidly as we hoped.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tThe late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen offers another lesson. In 2010, Allen took the pledge to see his wealth halved. At that time, his net worth was a paltry $13.5 billion. Immediately after he set to work giving away his money, he began trending in the exact opposite direction: Despite giving over $2 billion to charity in his lifetime (which, of course, isn\u2019t half to begin with), Allen died last year with over $20 billion in assets. Oops.\n\nhttps://prospect.org/power/billionaire-class-created-failed-wealth-tax-giving-pledge/",

We did all the printing for the city government including the police department so we\u2019d get cops coming in a lot. And being a small town everyone knew everyone. They have a homeless problem like most places, but I\u2019d hear the chief of police talking to my boss about how they have to \u201ceducate\u201d the people of the town to not give money to the homeless people since it encourages their behavior. He didn\u2019t exactly use the term \u201cpest\u201d but it very much felt like a reference to a \u201cpest problem.\u201d  He may have even referenced not feeding squirrels if you don\u2019t want them in your yard. It was honestly pretty sickening to hear from the head of police. \n\nThen again my boss and his wife were the kind to whine about how they \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to look at\u201d the tent cities along the off ramp they use to drive home. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s nothing attractive about tent cities (and they can do a lot of harm) but god damn. It\u2019s sad when you see people in such a poor state and you\u2019re first thought isnt \u201chow can this be improved\u201d but \u201chow dare my eyes be made to lay upon such filth.\u201d Ffs. I understand trying not to exacerbate a problem but the utter and complete lack of even an iota of compassion is just staggering.",

That can potentially cause issues with the cleanliness of the space, and it may also scare people off, especially if they're being rowdy (homeless people sometimes suffer from mental illness) or relieving themselves in public, or drinking in public.\n\nI don't know if any of that is a good reason to ban people from feeding the homeless, but I think that's why some places have laws against it.",

His wealth is tied to Amazon, for which he obviously earns a very pretty penny.\n\nThe government wouldn't be able to directly tax Bezos' wealth. What, should they take stocks as payment for taxes, and slowly take over every corporation? That might be an answer, but stocks are not cold cash that can be spent directly on healthcare or education or whatever.",

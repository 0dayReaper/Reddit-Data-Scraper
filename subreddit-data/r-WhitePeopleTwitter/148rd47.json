He reorganized the government according to his own brand of conservative political principles and then retired. As soon as he was gone, everything he enacted was overturned and civil wars resumed again.  But I bet Elon Musk didn\u2019t know any of this and just says shit he thinks is profound without any knowledge of what he\u2019s talking about.  Talking to him is like talking to your dumbest but most confident relative.",

So yeah this is nothing new.\n\nBut the Melon fans will still suck his balls and say he is a \"Genius\".",

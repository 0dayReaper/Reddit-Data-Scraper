The study was quoted as saying that the impact of support or lack there of for a law had a statistically insignificant, near-zero impact on whether that law was passed. If the top 10% all supported it however it had a much higher (nothing crazy high like 90% I don't think, just something like 70% from memory but still significant) chance of passing and if NONE of them did it was almost a guarantee it wouldn't pass.",

For example, a large amount of chlorine is carried by rail that goes to our water treatment plants, which means drinking water becomes iffy and many areas will probably be under a boil advisory. \n\nI want to be clear here, I absolutely support the rail workers and if they strike I\u2019m fucking here for it. But I think we all need to be aware that it\u2019ll hit us in ways we don\u2019t expect, and those of us who are able need to be prepared to help those of us who are harder hit by these knock-on effects.",

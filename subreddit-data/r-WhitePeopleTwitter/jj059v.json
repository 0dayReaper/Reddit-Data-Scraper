A HUGE number of people don't work Monday to Friday, they work what ever hodge podge fuckey schedule their retailer boss sets, which often doesn't even have all of the days in the work week in a row, and for many service industry employees, it requires working every single weekend. Give people a whole week to fit in voting when ever their shifts allow, make it accessible to as many disabilities as possible, make a special *free*  public transit round to help get people there and back, and hell I'd honest say make the booths consistently a 24/7 operating location, with multiple shifts of polling booth runners, where booths are needed, and make mail ballots the standard nationally. \n\n\n\n America has a huge population, many of whom need multiple jobs to live, and too many important dates and services are locked behind restrictive hours and weekdays, meaning people who can't afford it have to take time off of work to vote or go to the DMV or visit a government branch to take care of necessary things, it's just shitty.",

Many bank apps have hordes of money accessible through them. They are exceptionally secure or they wouldn't exist. Security and verification can be done from both ends and that would be more secure then those electronic vote machines. Is it a good idea despite that(I cited the lack of paper trail being an issue), possibly not but some of the criticisms so far are clearly not realistic or are based on old out dated ideas. IRS does alot online and they are literally the foundation of the military, government and infrastructure. Voting could be done digitally and secure. The only one I'm afraid of in this digital scenario is the government but can the government be trusted with paper or electronic booths all three have the same issues.",

If the vote is designed to be changeable, then that makes it extremely susceptible to nefarious vote changes, and there would be little reason to suspect any interference or manipulation, and, as you mentioned, there would be no paper trail to verify if any given vote is legitimate and unchanged.\n\nThe idea is nice in theory, but in practice would be a disaster.",

A simple process that lets them vote at their convivence anytime of the course of a month or so. Or expand early voting so that people can choose what time works for them.",

If you are on the electoral roll (which you must join), and do not vote, you will be issued a fine. This is $50 for federal elections ($20 for first time offenders) and $25 for state elections. \n\nA workaround, however, is to attend a polling booth and submit a blank ballot. But, if you\u2019ve gone to the effort to turn up, you may as well just number the boxes and leave.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t care about people\u2019s reasons for not voting, unless you have a valid reason and are looking to overturn the fine.\n\nChoosing not to vote without a valid, legally recognised reason is still an offence.\n\nOne of the reasons why compulsory voting works for us is because our population is *a lot* smaller, at around 26 million people, compared to ~330 million in the United States. That\u2019s over *300 million* more people to keep track of, which would make enforcing compulsory voting over there an absolute nightmare.\n\nThe reason why have compulsory voting in the first place is because voter turnout strongly declined following WWII. Our government wants to ensure that the results of each election reflect the views of the majority of the population, rather than just the same vocal minority who show up to vote without being asked.\n\nAlthough being forced to vote can be a pain (mainly because our politicians are mainly very dull), it has arguably saved us from finding ourselves in the same political crisis as the United States. \n\nMost people just turn up for the sausage sizzle though.",

                            "comment": "The very first issue you run into is that the US has a grand total of zero national holidays.\n\nWe have federal holidays, where the only people *required* to have the day off are non-essential government employees.  Step one would be to institute a national holiday at all, which brings us to the second issue.\n\nBecause of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employers are not required to pay employees while they aren't at work.  Employers are not required to offer extra pay for holidays, either.  If you get holiday pay and paid leave, that's because the individual employer *decided* to offer that.  There is no legal requirement.  The only legal requirement is that you get paid for hours worked.  Step two is to change that act to require employers to either give the day off, with or without pay.  Without pay only hurts the employees and with pay is something that employers will have legions of lobbyists fighting against through Congress and lawsuits.\n\nMaking it a holiday as they are in the US right now would change nothing.  Most employers aren't going to give employees a paid day off and many people can't miss a day's wages.\n\nMaking it easier to vote is the best solution, but certain states also won't do this as it would affect their party's chances at winning.  Not every state offers early voting or vote by mail.  The federal government *can't* force states to adopt these measures because of the 10th Amendment.\n\n&gt; Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.\n\nFurther notes:\n\n- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, and the territory of Puerto Rico have declared Election Day a civic holiday. \n- Some other states require that workers be permitted to take time off from employment without loss of pay. [You can check your state here.](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/taking-time-off-voting-jury-29708.html) \n- California Elections Code Section 14000 and New York State Election Law provide that employees without sufficient time to vote must be allowed two hours off with pay, at the beginning or end of a shift. \n- Democracy Day, a planned federal holiday to coincide with Election Day, was unsuccessfully proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate in 2005. It was later reintroduced in the Senate in 2014 and has not been enacted.",

Many also require retailers be closed on Sundays.\n\nAnd whether you're paid on those holidays is up to the company or a labor union. And if you're a salaried worker, paid holidays are not really and idea that makes sense. You get paid the same whether you work or not. \n\nSo depending who you work for and where you live, America has paid holidays.",

Some States I\u2019ve lived in made absentee voting almost impossible by requiring you to give a reason, and have it approved, by no later than six weeks before the election. These same places had sneaky ways of limiting early voting too. For example, if you voted early you had to vote at your normal polling place, only some polling places are schools or churches, etc, and would only be open certain hours. When people complained, they made a law that all early polling locations had to be open 8 hrs/day, 7 days/week for the two weeks before the election. Sounds great, except they couldn\u2019t afford to staff them for that much time, so the end result was actually closing polling stations.

If people were serious about what the \"founding fathers\" were thinking they would actually read something like [The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/farrand-the-records-of-the-federal-convention-of-1787-vol-1):\n\n&gt;The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge of the wants or feelings of the day laborer.  The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed  interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we  approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe; when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of  trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in  future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be *insecure*. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the  government, to support these invaluable interests and to balance and  check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect **the minority of the opulent** against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have  permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions; but my  opinion is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these  views be answered. - James Madison, June 26th, 1787\n\nAlways explained more in depth by [Chomsky](https://youtu.be/gGfFXc0TwhU).",

                    "comment": "Something I find interesting to bring up is that the United States has a long history of immigrant and non-citizen voting. For hundreds of years in colonial and early America - as it turns out - founding fathers didn\u2019t actually care as much about immigrants and noncitizens voting as they they did about nonwhite men voting. As such, our American roots of noncitizen voting were stripped when confronted with the \u201cbad\u201d immigrants:\n\n&gt;\tOnce you go further back through American history, you\u2019ll find a lot more non-citizen voting: Around 40 states have extended voting rights for non-citizens at various points. \"It's not been inevitable or natural that voting has been tied to citizenship,\" says Ronald Hayduk, a professor of political science at Queens College, City University of New York, and author of Democracy for All: Restoring Immigrant Voting Rights in the U.S.\n\n&gt;\tIn the earliest days, of course, America was chock-full of voting immigrants, fresh off the boat. During the Colonial Era, all white men with property were allowed to vote, and that continued after the American Revolution. In Pennsylvania, an eligible male needed only to have lived in the state for two years before he could vote. In a 1993 paper in the Penn Law Review, Jamie Raskin, who was an American University law professor at the time (and one of the pioneers of non-citizens voting rights in Takoma Park), explained the history of what he called \u201calien suffrage\u201d:\n\n&gt;\tIt is crucial to see that the early spirit of political openness toward aliens was perfectly compatible with the exclusionary definition of \"the American people as Christian white men of property.\" To exclude aliens from voting would have given rise to the dangerous inference that U.S. citizenship was the decisive criterion for suffrage at a time when the majority of U.S. citizens, including almost all women and substantial percentages of men without property, were categorically excluded from the franchise.\n\n&gt;\tThe practice had its ups and down in the 18th century, but voting among immigrants was common at state, federal, and regional elections, and it was extremely popular at the local level. Suspicion towards foreigners spiked during the War of 1812, and in the lead-up to the Civil War, several states tweaked the criteria for voter eligibility or abolished non-citizen voting outright. The South codified its ban in the Confederate Constitution 1861, mainly because immigrants tended not to support slavery. But the practice returned after the Civil War and during Reconstruction, and in the 1860s and 1870s, immigrant voting was at its peak, as an incentive to lure foreign labor westward.\n\n&gt;\tAll that changed between 1880 and 1920, when the flow of migrants escaping political instability and famine in Eastern Europe swelled. These were poor people with darker skin and different religious beliefs; many spoke unfamiliar languages and concentrated in cities, where they started political movements that threatened the status quo. Both the Republican and Democratic parties leveraged the simmering racism and rising xenophobia accompanying World War I to clamp down\u2014state by state\u2014on non-citizen voting rights. Other voting right restrictions were also put in place at the same time, Hayduk notes in a 2015 article for Journal of International Migration and Integration:\n\n&gt;\tIn fact, noncitizen voting was abolished at the same time that other restrictive measures were also enacted by elites, including literacy tests, poll taxes, felony disenfranchisement laws, and restrictive residency and voter registration requirements\u2014all of which combined to disenfranchise millions of voters.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-07/the-curious-history-of-non-citizen-voting",

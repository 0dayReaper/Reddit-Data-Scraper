Trump was so effective because he used really simple sound bites to attack his enemies and give them stupid nicknames that permeated the media.  Sure, people that take time to educate themselves and read various viewpoints aren\u2019t fooled, but that\u2019s a minority of people.  Democrats keep trying to take the high ground; they need a marketing strategy that lets them define who they are rather than fighting against the GOP defining who they are...and that isn\u2019t going to happen with policy talk, unfortunately.\n\nJust as an example, I\u2019ve worked in healthcare for 13 years...the amount of patients who were on some form of Obamacare that came in and got care but STILL thought it was some type of socialist scheme to destabilize the country was mind boggling; and when I would counter their points with facts that I absolutely knew to be true, they\u2019d look at me and tell me I was wrong and that some dipshit talking head knew the real reasons and I needed to read up on it.",

That's all it really takes. All Fox News has to do is let Tucker Carlson bitch all over the place about how Biden said taxes wouldn't increase for people making less than $400k, conveniently leave out the part where this was Trump's legislation, and then watch the world burn.",

She works in a small town in Texas with a lot of rich old white people, nothing on earth would get her to vote blue.  As another has stated, it was just an excuse for her... she thought we would accept taxes as a valid reason to vote Trump, but alas her son and I have morals.",

                                    "comment": "I\u2019ve posted this before, but it\u2019s important to lay out some of the details.\n\nThis is a general overview of Biden\u2019s proposed tax plan:\n\n&gt;\tBiden says no individual with taxable income of $400,000 or less would see a federal tax increase under his plans, at least directly. Less than than 2% of U.S. households report that level of income. There are several policy provisions tied up in Biden\u2019s promise, but income tax rates often get the most attention.\n\n&gt;\tThere are currently seven rates (10% to 37%) applied to varying income brackets. Biden\u2019s plan would raise only the top rate, pushing it to 39.6%, what it was before the Republicans\u2019 2017 overhaul. That rate kicks in for income beyond $510,000 or so, and more for married couples filing jointly. Separately, Biden proposes capping certain itemized deductions for higher earners. Those changes could mean variable tax increases for individuals down to that $400,000 income threshold \u2014 more for married joint filers.\n\n&gt;\tThe existing 12.4% payroll tax, which is split between employers and workers and finances the Social Security program, applies only to the first $137,700 of a person\u2019s income. That cap goes up annually with inflation.\n\n&gt;\tBiden proposes instituting the tax again beginning at $400,001 of income. The untaxed gap between the cap and $400,001 would close over time with the annual inflationary increases. That would eventually mean a Social Security system where all wage earners, regardless of their income and profession, paid the full freight of payroll taxes.\n\n&gt;\tBiden applies a similar philosophy to investment income. Generally, current law taxes gains on long-term investments \u2014 those held for more than a year \u2014 and certain dividend income at capital gains rates that top out at 20%. That\u2019s lower than the marginal income tax rates for many in the investor class.\n\n&gt;\tGains on short-term holdings of less than a year are subject to personal income tax rates. Biden proposes extending that principle to all investment gains for any income beyond $1 million, a change that could significantly affect the wealthiest investor class.\n\n&gt;\tHe wants a 28% percent corporate tax rate. That\u2019s higher than the current 21% but lower than the 35% rate before the 2017 overhaul. President Barack Obama had pushed for a 28% rate but Republicans in Congress refused to negotiate.\n\n&gt;\tSeparately, Biden wants a 15% minimum tax on \u201cbook profits\u201d \u2013 net annual income \u2013 for corporations with at least $100 million in income.\n\n&gt;\tBiden wants to double the current 10.5% minimum tax that multinational corporations pay on foreign profits.\n\n&gt;\tTo the chagrin of some progressives, Biden opposes a tax based on individuals\u2019 net worth. He\u2019s also avoided rekindling debate over taxes imposed on heirs of large estates. Biden does want one estate tax change that could significantly affect wealthy inheritors and raise tens of billions in revenue each year.\n\n&gt;\tCurrently, beneficiaries can sell off assets they inherited and pay capital gains based only on any accrual between the time they gained ownership of the asset and the time they sold it. That basically exempts from taxation any gains accrued by the deceased owner. Biden proposes eliminating that inheritor benefit and instead applying capital gains taxes based on the original value of an asset.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/2e319858f049ddf25d975476455b7305\n\n\nThe Nation also has a concise [infograph on some of the bigger changes](https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Score-Biden-Tax-Plan_img.jpg). The source for that can be found here: https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/biden-tax-plan/tnamp/\n\nRight now, the American tax system is constructed to benefit the rich. Biden\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go as far as I would like, but it is a significant improvement. Even under our current tax system, biased as it is, the IRS doesn\u2019t have the means to enforce it on the rich.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have deliberately dried out the IRS budget to the point that the agency itself admits it doesn\u2019t have the means to audit the rich, *even though doing so would bring a net profit*. Instead, they audit the working poor:\n\n&gt;\tIt\u2019s taken eight years to bring the agency that funds the government this low. Over time, the IRS has slowly transformed, one employee departure at a time.\n\n\n&gt;\tThe result is a bureaucracy on life support and tens of billions in lost government revenue. ProPublica estimates a toll of at least $18 billion every year, but the true cost could easily run tens of billions of dollars higher.\n\n\n\n&gt;\tThe cuts are depleting the staff members who help ensure that taxpayers pay what they owe. As of last year, the IRS had 9,510 auditors. That\u2019s down a third from 2010. The last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents was 1953, when the economy was a seventh of its current size. And the IRS is still shrinking. Almost a third of its remaining employees will be eligible to retire in the next year, and with morale plummeting, many of them will.\n\n\n&gt;\tThe IRS conducted 675,000 fewer audits in 2017 than it did in 2010, a drop in the audit rate of 42 percent. But even those stark numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, say current and former IRS employees: Auditors are stretched thin, and they\u2019re often forced to limit their investigations and move on to the next audit as quickly as they can.\n\n&gt;\tWithout enough staff, the IRS has slashed even basic functions. It has drastically pulled back from pursuing people who don\u2019t bother filing their tax returns. New investigations of \u201cnonfilers,\u201d as they\u2019re called, dropped from 2.4 million in 2011 to 362,000 last year. According to the inspector general for the IRS, the reduction results in at least $3 billion in lost revenue each year. Meanwhile, collections from people who do file but don\u2019t pay have plummeted. Tax obligations expire after 10 years if the IRS doesn\u2019t pursue them. Such expirations were relatively infrequent before the budget cuts began. In 2010, $482 million in tax debts lapsed. By 2017, according to internal IRS collection reports, that figure had risen to $8.3 billion, 17 times as much as in 2010. The IRS\u2019 ability to investigate criminals has atrophied as well.\n\n&gt;\t..\n\n&gt;\tFor the rich, who research shows evade taxes the most, the IRS has become less and less of a force to be feared.\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted\n\n&gt;\tThe IRS audits the working poor at about the same rate as the wealthiest 1%. Now, in response to questions from a U.S. senator, the IRS has acknowledged that\u2019s true but professes it can\u2019t change anything unless it is given more money.\n\n&gt;\t..\n\n&gt;\tOn the one hand, the IRS said, auditing poor taxpayers is a lot easier: The agency uses relatively low-level employees to audit returns for low-income taxpayers who claim the earned income tax credit. The audits \u2014 of which there were about 380,000 last year, accounting for 39% of the total the IRS conducted \u2014 are done by mail and don\u2019t take too much staff time, either. They are \u201cthe most efficient use of available IRS examination resources,\u201d Rettig\u2019s report says.\n\n&gt;\tOn the other hand, auditing the rich is hard. It takes senior auditors hours upon hours to complete an exam. What\u2019s more, the letter says, \u201cthe rate of attrition is significantly higher among these more experienced examiners.\u201d As a result, the budget cuts have hit this part of the IRS particularly hard.\n\n&gt;\t**For now, the IRS says, while it agrees auditing more wealthy taxpayers would be a good idea, without adequate funding there\u2019s nothing it can do. \u201cCongress must fund and the IRS must hire and train appropriate numbers of [auditors] to have appropriately balanced coverage across all income levels,\u201d the report said.**\n\n&gt;\t**Since 2011, Republicans in Congress have driven cuts to the IRS enforcement budget; it\u2019s more than a quarter lower than its 2010 level, adjusting for inflation.**\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/irs-sorry-but-its-just-easier-and-cheaper-to-audit-the-poor\n\nI would recommend checking out the books *The Triumph of Injustice* and *Perfectly Legal* for a more complete, readable analysis of how the US tax structures benefit those at the top, how the rich deliberately lobbied to create the system in place today, and potential ways to fix it. Both books give great insight into how someone like Trump can end up paying $750 in taxes, even without it being illegal (though jury is still out the legality of Trump\u2019s taxes).",

Their figures consider how individuals\u2019 tax bills will change, as well as how the benefits and services they currently receive \u2014 like Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 will be adjusted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The following chart uses [CBO data](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/reconciliationrecommendationssfc.pdf) analyzed by [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-the-senate-tax-bill-affects-rich-and-poor-in-three-charts) to represent how the Senate tax plan would impact \u201ctax units\u201d \u2014 either a family or an individual taxpayer \u2014 across varying income brackets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; According to the [CBO\u2019s calculations](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/reconciliationrecommendationssfc.pdf), individuals in every tax bracket below $75,000 will experience a year in which they record a net loss \u2014 meaning they\u2019ll pay more in taxes, experience diminished services, or both \u2014 by 2027. \n\nI've read this several times and I'm still confused. \n\nFirst I was thinking this was inflation-related, but if that's the case, higher earners would be affected just the same. \n\nCan someone ELI5?",

The owner of the assets dies, pays the estate tax, and passes the assets on to the inheritors (extremely simplified).\n\nIf a landlord thinks they will own more in estate tax when they die, they would need to increase their cashflow to be able to pay the estate tax so the assets dont get stuck in the estate for years after death. Its basic estate planning. so while I think its bullshit, if the owner of the estate thinks they will owe more in estate tax, they would need to increase rent to make sure they have liquid cash to pay said tax.",

Also, anyone who will be 18 when the election happens in January will be eligible to register, even if they're 17 now. December 7th is the final date you can register to vote, December 14th is when early voting begins and the election day is January 5th.

If we flip these two senate seats blue we'd have senate majority, which will make it easier to enact actual change. The special election is January 5th. \n\nDonating funds helps by funding their public out reach through ads and the like, as well as paying campaigners and staffers, allowing them to rent space, buy relevant voter data, etc.\n\nAnother aspect to remember is that southern states aren't red states, they're voter suppression states. That's why I highly recommend donating to www.fairfight.com which is Stacy Abram's org. She, among others, were responsible for registering 800k voters in GA.\n\nThey are also accepting volunteers both locally and nationally.

Good on you for that.\n\nPolitical campaigns typically budget their spending only up to the election, with a little left over for wrapping up the campaign's debts. So, when a runoff is called, it becomes a new campaign that needs a new budget to buy ads (TV, online, etc.) because it is literally a new election for that specific race. (In this case, two races.) There will need to be a lot of money to pay for mailers, new ads, get-out-the-vote efforts, yard signs, billboards, etc.\n\nThe other big point, especially in GA, is working to convince either those who haven't voted to do so, or those who are undecided and could really vote either way. In rare cases, voters who chose one candidate might now get new information on the candidates now that there is much more focus on that specific race and not as much on all the other races that make up the November election ballot.",

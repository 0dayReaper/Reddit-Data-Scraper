A viewer stumbling across the show would presumably assume it's presenting the news.\n\nIf you asked 100 republicans what fox news is they would respond with some definition of a news station likely useing the word news.\n\nThis would be like if Coca-Cola randomly decided actually they are an industrial cleaner company because you can use their product to clean blood and then were like I don't know why our customers drink it that's not it's purpose.",

He's not a primary source.  Fox is not anymore because they have placed themselves in the same category as the Daily Show.

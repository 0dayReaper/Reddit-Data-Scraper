Go be a piece of shit and hurt and kill as many as you can and you will also get a Netflix special and maybe a Hollywood movie played by a a list star\u2026.\n\nAnd so many women fucking love this shit. There are so many that say they wish they could date Ted bundy or find him attractive even knowing what he did\u2026 like wtf\u2026.",

Just another daily shooting.\n\nBut hearing hundreds of bullets were sprayed on dozens of small kids and their bodies are almost butchered and unrecognizable is completely different!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing George Floyd getting choked to death live on TV has sparked all the BLM movement/protests.\n\nWhat do you think will happen if people were shown the images of these dead kids 'butchered' bodies instead of their smiling happy faces???",

At first glance it did not appear that there were any casualties. To the left of the room as you walk in\nthere was a bathroom in the corner. There was a massive pile up of bodies in this room. At the time I did not know that it was a bathroom and wondered how the suspect had the time to kill that many people and stack them in the corner of the room.*\n\n&gt;*There appeared to be about 15 bodies in the small room and several bodies, including two adults near the entrance to the room. There was one adult and I believe one chird the were laying prone on their backs approximately several feet from the entrance to the bathroom. All the other bodies were inside the bathroom or in the entrance to the bathroom. An adult victim was lying across the mass of bodies inside of the bathroom.*\n\n&gt;*Sgt. Carrio stated that he was an EMT (or maybe a paramedic) and that he had to check to see if anyone in the pile may have survived. I agreed as the bodies were stacked two or three high and that some of the children at the bottom, who were able to cram in first, may have escaped bullets.*\n\n&gt;*Sgt. Carrio began to lift bodies off of the top of the pile and bring them to an open floor area. He began to look for life signs, wounds, and to attempt to find a pulse. The victims on the top of the pile and many of the bodies had injuries that were obviously fatal.*\n\n&gt;*As Sgt. Carrio began to empty out the bathroom it became apparent what had occurred due to how efficiently packed in the bathroom the children were. It appeared as if the teachers in the room immediately upon hearing gun shots began to pack children into the bathroom. The children that were sitting on the floor of the bathroom were packed in like sardines. One little girl was sitting, crouched in between the toilet seat and the back corner of the room. I thought that she might have the best chance for survival.*\n\n&gt;*As the pile got higher it appeared that there was a mad scramble to get into the bathroom, with people stepping on one another and climbing on top of each other. The teachers would not have been able to get into the room even if they had wanted to.*\n\n&gt;*The teachers appeared to have been shepherding the children into the room and were then probably going to shut the door. They did not close and lock the door to the classroom for some reason and were interrupted by the shooter as they attempted to fill the bathroom with children. The shooter then opened fire on the mass of children and adults.*\n\n&gt;*As Sgt. Carrio got to the last bodies, it was clear that no one had survived.*\n\nThe bathroom was about 4.5 by 3 feet in size.\n\nThese photos have never been released, for obvious reasons. Every lawmaker who takes NRA money should have to see those photos.",

Governor Abbot should be forced to see what these little children looked like. In fact any politician who refuses to consider changing gun laws or act should be forced to see what the victims of mass shootings looked like after being shot. They should be forced to see what was done to these innocent victims. If they still feel like not considering changes to the law then that should be known to their voters.",

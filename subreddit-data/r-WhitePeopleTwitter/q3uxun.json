I might have grown an inch (again haven't measured) but couldn't be more than that. However I have orthotic shoe insoles that add at least an inch to my height (bad knees).\n\nSo, generously, I might be 5'9\" walking around in my shoes. Whenever asked I always say I'm 5'7\". Girls are always surprised. Guys who are around my height get real uncomfortable. I have a good chuckle to myself.",

Not worried at all.\n\nWe were in the same friend group and I knew he was interested, but it took a while for me to return that interest. I think I fell for him on our first date when he said, \u201cYou know I\u2019m really into you, right?\u201d\n\nI loved how easily he said it, how comfortably he sat in his skin, how fine he was with putting himself out there. He is built solid, so if I had shot him down it wouldn\u2019t have rocked him. That was the first time I got a glimpse into what a truly steady, no bullshit person he is, and how being around him feels like breathing clean air.",

I wanted them to know what they were getting into. At the start I didn\u2019t have it listed, and my photos didn\u2019t make me look that tall (that was not by design or anything.) The girl I met up with was a little taken aback because she expected me to be on the shorter side apparently.",

Honestly the lying and insecurity are the biggest problems I had with dating shorter men. I get why they can be insecure, but I was dating them so it just seemed really unnecessary to lie about something so damned obvious. You're clearly not taller than me, so claiming your height is more than mine is... really dumb.",

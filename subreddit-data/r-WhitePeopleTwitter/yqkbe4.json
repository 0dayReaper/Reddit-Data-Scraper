The lobby is full of older people, and after a while, this guy comes in. He's probably 65+. \n\nHe comes in, sits down, and then proceeds to speedrun through every topic you can think of, pushing his old school hardcore christian republican American ideas on the people he's talking to. He would ask people questions just so they could answer and he could tell them what the right answer was. \n\nEx: \"Do you go to church every sunday? You need to.\"\n\nAt first I was a little annoyed, listening to him. After a little while, I really couldn't help but notice his impulsive need to keep changing the subject and keep pushing his views on people. He was relatively clam, but spoke at a manic pace. He seems broken, mentally, on some level. Not in a way that I felt there was anything physiologically wrong with him, but his mind was clearly the result of lots of propaganda and a lack of critical thinking.\n\nHe felt like an avatar of ignorant humanity. There will always be people like him in the world, but there happen to be quiet a few right now, due to WW2 creating the largest group of similar age people in this country. Times gotta pass...... as morbid as it is, theres no correcting some people. They are going to stay stupid and vote to the tune of their overlords until they die.",

It would be viewed as the Dems repudiating the entire Biden admin if they didn't run her since she was the VP.\n\nAlso, I agree with you about her not motivating the base. She's polls terribly and her primary performance was atrocious. Kamala probably loses to most Republicans and definitely loses to Trump. That's why I want Biden to run again. I'm not a huge fan of Biden and I really hate the idea of running someone that old, but I think it's better then Harris. \n\nBesides, they kept Reagan in office even after Alzheimer's turned his brain into mush. We can do the same with Biden if needed.\n\nedit:\n\nAs soon as Biden announced her as his VP pick I was worried about what happens after Biden since if he wins then that means that we should expect her to be the most likely candidate for the next cycle.",

Every generation has had its struggles but Gen X, Milennials, Gen Z, all have 1000x more empathy and compassion than any boomer I've ever heard speak.\n\nI'm so sick of the \"fuck you I got mine\" mentality that gets to legislate this country.  \"I had to suffer and therefore you should too\" is just sick to me.  So many older people got to take advantage of programs and policies that benefitted them but want to pull the ladder up behind them so others can't benefit as well - because they have this whacked out sense of entitlement.  They suffered more, so they're more deserving.  We're the soft generations who don't deserve shit because we didn't suffer?  We're not deserving of comfortable lives because we didn't suffer?  That's a horrifying way to look at your children, grandchildren, neighbors, fellow humans.\n\nWe have immense amounts of knowledge and technology that could make life safe and happy and comfortable for our people, but boomers want us to suffer.  Cruelty is the point and it's sick.\n\nI loved my grandparents.  I love my parents.  But I cannot wait for these lead poisoned lunatics to lose their grip on our throats.",

And then Trump comes along and they just swallow everything. I told my dad Trump was separating the migrant kids from the families and being cruel to those kids. My dad told me, and I quote here, \"Im okay with them putting those kids in cages.\" Aaaaaand now I am no contact",

Then again even DMX was a better actor then Segal. Lol. As for Sorbo he just never had the talent to do anything. His characters were carried by the many great talented actors around him. After all Hercules is one big show had greats such as Karl Urban, Bruce Campbell, Gina Toress, Ted Raimi, and Lucy Lawless.",

It's going to happen regardless at this point if the Republicans ever take the presidency and the Senate back. Then the Democrats will have no choice while the Republicans in power will throw all of their political enemies in prison with control of the Supreme Court and Congress using kangaroo courts after passing the very vague laws they are at a state level on the federal, taking points from dictators throughout history.  They've studied how to overthrow democracies well enough as those who have actively been involved in coups in Latin American countries in the US's interests. \n\n Trump gave them an insane amount of progress in their destabilization of democracy and the only way to stop it is for the Feds to start using the judiciary to lock up these threats, as they are currently doing with Trump, until about a quarter of the country declares civil war and secession and we can solve the problem with the blood of patriots and tyrants nourishing the tree of liberty.\n\n We are reaching the point of no return to normalcy where a large enough minority of Americans have given up on the institutions of state, especially Democracy, as they become a gradually diminishing minority and the death knell grows louder. Democracy is the greatest threat to them at this point and needs to be destroyed for them to cling to power. We just have to hope that enough of them are too old and dead before we reach that point. Then we can finally make some progress as climate change causes mass starvation, global conflict, and ecological collapse. Talk to any climate scientist and they'll laugh at you talking about the survival and continuation of modern nation states and our global economic system, where either the military will need to take control to bring some degree of stability or the people, with the military's support, will overthrow it in a desperate terror and panic as their lives are in jeopardy.",

Now has backpedalled, again because she had it personally affect her.\n\nThey've both changed tunes at different points because they had personal impacts. Dick never ducked around, and simply realized the rhetoric and actions were harmful. Lizzy ducked around and found out, then realized she didn't like finding out.\n\nChange comes slowly.",

He doesn't seem to give a shit. He'll throw his kids under the bus so he can go to Cancun, then try to legislate his daughter's life away because he's a fucking vile bastard.\n\nNow those are the ones I struggle to understand the life of.

He literally put out a press release blaming her for the vacation saying it was a trip she had been dying to go on or some shit like that. Later on she aired his dirty laundry on TikTok saying she said no such thing and it was all him.\n\nYou know who didnt run away? Beto O'Rourke or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. One wasnt even a politician in Texas and the other failed to unseat Cruz but BOTH were here during the same period helping relief efforts in areas that were out of power for days.\n\nOh And Cruz left his fucking dog alone in his house without power the whole time he was away.",

Regan is either hated or fondly remembered as the fountain head of modern conservativism. However, if you really read about him and Nancy you get to peek behind the facade. \n\nIn reality the Regan's we're just shitty people who would do or say anything to stay in power. They didn't care about Christianity, homosexuals, communism, or even race. Those were just the easiest steps to climb to relevancy. \n\nRonald Regan started out as a has been daytime actor who's only real power came from being active in the actors union. He would go on to sell out his union members, competition and friends a like. Eventually passing of some of the most damaging labor laws in our history \n\nAs others said, these people so often presented as true believers, had constant communication with astrologist and rarely stepped inside a church. \n\nHe had a long lasting friendship with Rock Hudson, until it became a political liability. Through the aids epidemic he still had an open homosexual as one of his cabinet members. \n\nAnd by his own admission his best friend growing up was a black man he played football with. All while actively fighting to suppress the rights of poc. \n\nHe was a hollow man, with no real beliefs. I would think more highly of him if he was actually some Christina right wing true believer. He was just a man who lacked morals and loved the spotlight. I would say Nancy was even worse, but at least she worked rose to power based on some level of skill, she was the throat goat after all.",

Nancy did try to steer Ronald on the matter, I'll give her a little bit of credit for that, but overall what they did was terrible and inexcusable. Ronald Reagan is a hero of the right and, in reality, was a cancer for the country.",

And even then, there's no one-on-one after with the professor or a chance to build bonds/relationships/network group with your fellow students.\n\nYou're getting the course, and even then its stripped down to bare necessities. College had a reputation of being an overpriced scam before, and it's even worse now.",

It felt weird paying for an education where I was correcting tests, and assignments myself...  \nThat being said it was a bit more difficult because there was little to none instruction and it was self driven and self paced program so I didn't get a ton of human interaction with my instructor",

The interactions and growth we get to witness over 4 years are nothing short of comparable to their first steps. And I get that with all of them. \n\nThey\u2019ll grab a lunch sure, some of them might even eat most of it. But that period is a break from the confines of that very classroom setting and to socialize on a broad scale. Groups sit together and get to meet in an informal setting and build bonds deeper than the homework. \n\nThink back to your high school years, and what really mattered to YOU as a student that felt locked inside for hours, learning things sometimes against your will. That small bit of freedom is what gets many of them through the day. I worry greatly that having them all separated and isolated in the same setting for extended periods of time will only drive some to lash out.",

So it would just be one more layer of protection. I know we were looking for a solution to just contain the spread of the virus in the immediate surroundings.  \n\nAnyone that would be in the room with the patient would be wearing this combination already. Our Enviromental Services staff also has a couple PAPR helmets for their department.\n\nOur hospital has been really, really, great at adding as many layers of protection for staff as possible. \n\nWe were really ahead of the ball in terms of locking down the hospital, the cafe inside that the public frequents, and visitors to the long term care department to anyone that didn't *need* to be inside.",

There, your temperature is taken, you are asked screening questions, given a mask if you do not have one, and then given a sticker with your name, date, and temp written on it.

My prediction is that when we finally get kids back in school you are going see kids from parents who are able to provide structure and education distance themselves from their less advantage peers by years. It is going to be really stark. A kid who finished second grade could easily come back to school reading and doing math at a first grade level. While other kids of the same age being at a 3rd grade level. How are schools going to cope with that? Those disparities are going to follow those kids. \n\nEven when we go back to normal, we are going to have address the impact covid has had. \n\nDistance learning doesn\u2019t have to suck. But the educational system was completely build on the premise of bricks and mortar, butts in seats any teachers giving lessons. Schools basically are trying to recreate that educational model using a computer screen. Zoom meetings are not a class room. This is not how we should be teaching kids. What we should be doing is leveraging what is powerful about information technology and using its best feature to engage and teach kids. The role of the teacher has to be completely changed. It is incredibly inefficient to for 1 teacher to give the same lesson to 25 kids, as another teacher 3 doors down the hall. \n\nLessons and curricula should be adaptive, and the teacher should be the coach to use data to aid the kid in the progress, and interact more one on one.",

Hispanic communities where parents have limited English are getting hit really hard as most of the adults work in informal service industry jobs like hotel cleaning where they have been laid off but not eligible for unemployment or any assistance. Many of them are also living in cash only rent situations where landlords aren't respecting any type of limits on evictions. There's likely going to be a significant population of children who may never return to school. Our homicide rate is 242% YOY. We are a title 1 area, but no where near as bad as some of the ones in surrounding communities.\n\nI get that COVID is bad and people are dying, but I have to believe if you think we need to keep shutting everything down you are at least middle class or better. A lot of people just don't realize that there is a very significant portion of people in the US who don't participate in the economy in any formal way but are responsible for a lot of work getting done. No government benefits or mandates are going to help them. There not doing 401ks or signing up for Obamacare or trying to buy houses and stuff. It's day to day getting something to eat and being able to pay rent and lights.\n\nThe bottom 20% household income level is under $18,500 (on a good year).

There are no right answers for low income parents and it really fucking pisses me off to have that dismissed as \"inconvenient.\"\n\n\nI know that sounds selfish and irrelevant, but I really do have a point. Parental stress is a serious issue when it comes to abusive households. I remember watching my mother like a hawk for any signs of distress, because that meant that things were about to get worse for me.\n\nYou combine parental stress, food insecurity, housing insecurity, job insecurity and you're going to have more kids that need help than normally would. But almost none of them will have access to the people who can recognize their problems and help them. We already have a shortage of social workers (and teachers), what happens when they start dying? How many will slip through the gaping cracks and die? And I don't know what can be done about it. It's not inconvenient, it's fucking terrifying.\n\n\nI hope your momma stays safe and I have so much respect for what she does; it must be heartbreaking. I hope things get better, but I expect them to get a whole lot worse.",

The average age of Covid deaths in Germany is ~80 (!) years.\n\nSome sources (that even highlight how dangerous Covid in general is, but just not for the young):\n\n - [economist.com](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/06/24/when-covid-19-deaths-are-analysed-by-age-america-is-an-outlier): see the right graph on the top\n - [lbc.co.uk](https://www.lbc.co.uk/hot-topics/coronavirus/why-its-more-than-just-another-flu-virus/) - \"Interestingly, children don't seem to show symptoms from Covid-19 and there are no known cases of children under 10 being ill with the virus.\" (surely there are a handful of cases by now but still)\n - [official CDC data](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku/data)\n\nAccording to the WHO the global Covid-19 fatality rate (chance to die when infected) is 0.6%, so that's actually a very good chance of survival. Now considering the average age of those who die is 80 it becomes clear that children are really safe, luckily.\n\nFor example, as of today not a single child or teenager in California has died of Covid-19 ([source](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Age-Group.aspx)).\n\nJust googeling for \"covid deaths by age\" or similar will reveal those things, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019#Infection_fatality_rate) is easy to read as well.",

That's like a 1-in-20000 chance.\n\nI get it, any death is bad, but how many kids are we gonna give mental illnesses like anxiety and OCD over this?  How many kids are gonna go hungry or be stuck in abusive households?  How many kids are going to fall behind in education and never catch back up?  How many kids are going to commit suicide?\n\nThis isn't a black-and-white issue.",

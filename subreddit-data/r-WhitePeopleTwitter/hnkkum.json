As someone who lives in Texas, I was excited around March when people started wearing masks. It seems so productive in curbing all sorts of transmissible germs and what not. Not just talking about covid but the whole lot of diseases/virus.\n\nThen it got political and I see less wearing them. I really was enjoying the trend towards wiping down surfaces and wearing masks\n\nEDIT: Reading my comment, I feel excited wasn\u2019t the best word choice. It was definitely a scary time, and people died and are still dying.",

Their plans were put in place with a very similar disease to this in mind - this is at the root of why the nations of East Asia and Oceania have done extremely well.\n\nThe countries which have handled it reasonably well have been places like Germany - which had a flexible plan but not one specific to this disease.\n\nThe countries which have had more trouble, but have put in place lockdowns and such, are those which prepared for something else and were relatively inflexible. This would be Italy, the UK, France, Spain, etc., which had essentially prepared for a flu pandemic (indeed, they'd probably do pretty well in that context).\n\nAnd then there are the countries where the virus, and any solutions to it, are highly politicised and it continues to grow unopposed.",

You have to find a mask (disposable or reusable/cloth) that fits flush *and* comfortably snug across your nose and mouth. If it drags down or to any point where  you're uncomfortable, it's no good. You'll spend all day futzing with it and it'll never feel right. \n\n2. Once it's on it's okay to put one or two fingers on it slightly to shift it around to your liking. People are too careful like \"nEvER tOUcH iT EvEr oR yOu DIE!!!\" Nah, shit happens, shift it with two fingers til your comfortable and if you're paranoid wash your hands or sanitize your hand with Purell/70%+ pure alcohol spray/Everclear when you get to your car.\n\nIf a developing nation like Vietnam that has less than 1/10th the GDP of the state of California can do this while everyone is running around there on scooters and mopeds shifting their masks every which way but off, then America will be fine doing the same.\n\nWe just need to come to an agreement that masks aren't Satan or worse, liberal. /s",

His followers take everything he says as gospel. Imagine if he had just said \u201cwear a mask\u201d from the jump.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people making the argument about \"but the CDC told us not to wear masks at one point!!?!!\" and yea, that was true at the time and they saw new evidence and changed their stance. Guess what, OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO CHANGED THEIR STANCE ON MASKS AND MOST ARE FINE BECAUSE THEY FOLLOWED THE SCIENCE. My point is if Trump had just listened to medical experts from the get-go, we would've controlled the pandemic and he'd be coasting to re-election right now.",

In a decade living in Japan I don\u2019t think I saw a single person pull over for an ambulance or fire truck. \nThe Japanese have very strict rules about politeness. It is ritualized and apparent in everything but being kind and decent is something you do outside of those culturally required instances. Certainly most Japanese like most people are also kind but what outsiders see as \u201call Japanese are kind\u201d is a bit of a misinterpretation of their cultural norms. \nMore homogenous places in general have stronger support for each other. The Japanese also have this feeling and work collectively.",

The problem I have is that I chose microbiology as a study-direction when we desperately need good politicians that are not born I to the role, or were given the role or cheated their way into the role as our leaders. We should try and vote for those people that have earned the role. Sadly there\u2019s barely anyone I\u2019m even interested in voting for because nothing ever changes and it fills me with pessimism and an existential dread for the rest of my life, my children\u2019s lives, everyone else on the planet in the foreseeable future. It turns me off talking about it, so I spend my days talking about science, because to me that\u2019s the only thing that promises improvement, a brighter future, any optimism I have has come from my parents, my friends and science. Come to think of it, the only person I would feel comfortable handing the entire planet off to is Elon Musk. Fuck it, it would be funny as shit and a lot more bearable than watching two old men fight for some boring useless small office in a small city in a small White House to be \u201cin charge\u201d of some country claiming to be the greatest country that ever was or will be lmao, every other large empire in history would tell the US to get fucked if they were still around to see what all the fuss is about. Those two can\u2019t even hold in their poop because their sphincters are too loose from some puppet master\u2019s hands up there, it is literally the least free, free country I\u2019ve ever heard claim how much freedom they have. Europe is decent, but not perfect either, but still more free from a lot of the bullshit that\u2019s going on over there. I feel like patriotism is just a way for prisoners to remind themselves what home feels like and to distract themselves from how uncomfortable they have made their own situation. Like \u201cyay, we accidentally invented large scale international terrorism because oil, and now we are free because we send our kids to kill their kids and our explosions are american but theirs are evil\u201d. \n\nEducation can open people\u2019s eyes to reality, and it is depressing af. If you\u2019ve made it this far, congrats, you win absolutely nothing. That\u2019s how life is and I want to change it, but I feel helpless. I\u2019m sad because I feel like I can\u2019t change my reality or anyone elses, but I have a strong urge to want to help others, I just don\u2019t know how, or what the point is if it makes no difference for anyone beyond those I try to help.\n\nEdit: this sounds like an alcohol fueled manifesto, but I\u2019m just run down by this half a year.",

One day as a joke he removed a tiny sticker from an apple and placed it gently and loosely on top of the head of this massive beast of a dog.

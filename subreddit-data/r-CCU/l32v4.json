I've got the DVDs if you don't want to sit in front of your computer for 3 hours at a time. \n\nA few years ago, I did a lecture on it for Celebration of Inquiry (Zeitgeist Addendum, to be exact). Eight people came. I'm thinking about doing another one this year. PM me if you're interested. ",

I used to be a huge advocate of it and well, just progression in general. This changed after a few disheartening events and I mainly keep to myself. Though I only openly discuss this stuff with my friends and peers, I find that discussion and recognition in itself is very significant. Sometimes, you've got to just sit on something for awhile to let it sink it. I don't really try to talk to people (especially on campus) about these things unless I've done proper research and can back up what I say with valid sources. The movie itself isn't completely a valid source to me. \n\nAre you a science major? I know a couple of professors who have seen it and I've chatted with some about it. It's refreshing. ",

I actually walked out of an Edu110 class there and took an F because my teacher literally said \"Kids are suppose to be treated fairly and equal\" and then 2 minutes later \"I can't take a kid with gauged ears seriously\". She teaches here too... she thinks she is intellegent but she is just educated. She also always hated me because i defended keeping religion out of schools in a 99% christian class. (I was the 1%)\n\nI had some issues at USC with my advocacy and being outspoken about progressive ideas. I am always getting myself into sticky situations but someone has to call out the bullshit. Without it nothing will change. ",

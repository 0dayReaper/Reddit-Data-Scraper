    "postText": "Hi guys I'm a high schooler from Connecticut and I am seriously considering Coastal Carolina. I'm mainly looking for a school with a big/huge party scene, a lot of school spirit, and decent academics. I know I have the grades to get in but right now my main two options are between CCU and ECU. Anyways I was wondering to all current students, what is the party scene like, is it big? What are the dorms like (i.e. are they strict/are they nice)? What are the people like down there? I'd really like somebody to just explain what it is like to go to coastal.",

            "comment": "I definitely wouldn't consider Coastal a great party school anymore, definitely when compared to other campuses I've been to. Things were different years ago, but things really quieted down. Of course you could always join a fraternity and then you'll have the same old parties every week. School spirit is something that disappears quick, with most students just going to the tailgates to drink and don't actually go to the games. Finally, the dorms and people are great tough but would definitely recommend going to ECU over CCU. ",

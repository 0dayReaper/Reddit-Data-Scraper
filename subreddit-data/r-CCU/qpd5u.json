It is at Broadway (best time to come around is 11-2).  It is free to walk around and check the cars/bikes out and a cost to enter your vehicle for judging.  We will have raffles for local restaurants and retailers as well.\n\n40% of proceeds to go benefit Relay for Life (the remainder is not our profit, but to cover our high costs of the show judging/location/etc.), so please come out and support the campus.",

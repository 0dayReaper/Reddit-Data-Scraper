            "comment": "\t\nisland  \n\n\u25b6noun \n1. a piece of land surrounded by water: the island of Crete | [as modifier] this island nation.\n2. a thing regarded as resembling an island, especially in being isolated, detached, or surrounded in some way: the university is the last island of democracy in this country. \u25a0 a traffic island. \u25a0 a free-standing kitchen unit with a worktop, allowing access from all sides.\n3. (Anatomy) a detached portion of tissue or group of cells. Compare with islet.\n\n- ORIGIN Old English egland, from eg \u2018island\u2019 (from a base meaning \u2018watery, watered\u2019) + land. The change in the spelling of the first syllable in the 16th cent. was due to association with the unrelated word isle. \n\n\t\nisle \n\n\u25b6noun  chiefly (literary)\nan island or peninsula, especially a small one: Crusoe's fabled isle | [in place names] the British Isles.\n\n- ORIGIN Middle English ile, from Old French, from Latin insula. The spelling with s (also in 15th-cent. French) is influenced by Latin. \n\n\nBasically, that \"s\" is only there because some middle class pricks thought that English needed to be more like Latin since Latin, being a dead language, was so \"well-preserved.\" Really, it was just a way to distinguish the Middle Class from the Lower Class.

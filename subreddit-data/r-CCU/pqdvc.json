I feel like it could be good (free) promotion of this subreddit, and we Redditors (who know proper usage and pronunciation of the term) could have control over it.\n\nOf course, the Coastal community will probably quickly take it too far and make it unfunny, but it could be interesting! If anything, we could make some awesome and relevant ones and be worshiped as gods.\n\nTL,DR: Should we make a Coastal Memes Facebook page?\n\nThoughts?",

I was thinking more about starting from a small single unit (one or two memes) and evolving slowly over time letting natural meme selection take its course until in a few years we have super CCU only memes. \n\nI think Tropical Smoothie Cafe Girl would be a good one. I used to work there and it was reported to me that a lot of the girls that brought dudes in to buy them smoothies were literally trading dome for smoothies.... that shit is crack to Coastal girls.

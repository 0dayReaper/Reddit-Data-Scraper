We have built it up over the last year to 60 subscribers. It has become apparent that some of the subscribers only exist to lurk and downvote my posts (haters). \n\nIf you don't like the things I post on here the solution is simple. This is a user generated content board. Its free and open to ANYTHING. Post your own stuff if you don't like whats going on. Tell your friends about it. This is a non-university sanctioned student run message board. It has so much potential to be used for all sorts of awesome connection purposes outside of the standard university \"everybody hold hands and talk about leadership\" nonsense. I would like to see a time when I don't feel like I have to post anything. A time when this reddit supplys itself with REAL user generated content. \n\nIf anyone wants to moderate, I will gladly resign. Magnetic Stain originated this subreddit and I just came in and promoted it. We need someone to replace me to promote this reddit and keep it active. \n\nTL;DR. Blow your dad. ",

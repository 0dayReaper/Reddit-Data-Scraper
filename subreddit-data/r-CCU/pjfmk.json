This is something I've been meaning to do myself for a while, but luckily All_in_bad_taste has taken the time to do it for me. So thank you very much to him.\n\nSecond, I have enabled custom flair. I figured you could add your major if you wanted, or anything really.\n\nThank you for your time. You can continue Redditing now :)",

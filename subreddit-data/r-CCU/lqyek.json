Sometimes like to go on walks with dogs back there but I don't have one so I need more friends with dogs.... \n\nI also have kayaked from there and the river is really pretty at that area, there is a pretty cool island. It seems like often I can detect the presence of ents as well....  I know the whole NWR like the back of my hand tho, all the small trails and even the unbeaten paths... I used to walk around there at night even... creep status but I was just trying to psychologically rape my fears of the dark woods alone and it really helped and it feels safer than the real wilderness... even tho the coastal bear probably used to live there... it had to come from somewhere.....",

I have often resented this area because there is nowhere to hike or enjoy the outdoors that didn't involve being at the beach. Now I find out that there are trails within walking distance from my house! Awesome. On my way there now actually :P",

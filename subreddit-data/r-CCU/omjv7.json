I went outside and walked around campus, ran into an old friend, had a conversation out in the middle of the prince lawn under the blue screen of death (the sky) and basically just spent the day warding off thoughts of offing myself because reddit was gone.... then I fapped, washed my hands (LOOK MOM I'M NOT AS BOHEMIAN AS YOU SAY), and took my car to the shop. After that I walked home from the shop and got really high on totally legal drugs. Then I watered my plants, yelled at the cat, and thought about cutting my hair, but I was too high... still need a haircut.... fuck\n\n\nShit was still so cash tho ",

As well as being a place to provide a forum for people to discuss their non-religion. This is the bible belt and religious tension is high in some people. Find speakers to come in and talk about how harmful religion is for us. Tips on practising altruism. Maybe share our favourite anecdotes.  Watching documentarys. Maybe even share and work on finding the positives things that various religions practice and work on incorporating them into our way of thinking and using them as they are. I am a fan of the sermon on the mount. ",

I think I might spend my free time tomorrow trying to locate a physical person to discuss it with. I would totally need help. I really do not want to run it, I just want the club to exist so I can be a member. I would also be interested in partaking in the national \"Ask an atheist\" day. That might go on regardless of the club or not. I intend to celebrate and spend the day convincing religious people that atheists are not what they think we are. I am sick of people telling me I cannot be moral without god, that is just not true. ",

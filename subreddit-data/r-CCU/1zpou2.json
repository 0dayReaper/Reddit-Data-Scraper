    "postText": "I'm currently living in NMB but am planning on moving closer to campus next semester. I was thinking either a house in quail creek/college park or an apartment at University Suites or The Cove. Does anybody have any experiences with any of those places? I'm kind of leaning towards a house because I like to smoke weed, which might be a problem in an apartment building. I can spend a max of 560/mo.",

It's town houses so they are bigger then apartments, you get a 2 car garage, close to campus, nice neighborhood, pool, and a lot of college kids leave here.  My rent is $525 all included. Could leave all the lights on in my house and the water running all month and I would still pay $525. Some landlords will do cheaper rent but you have to pay your own utilities. ",

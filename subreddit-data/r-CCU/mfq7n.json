    "postText": "What if we used Celebration of Inquiry to promote Reddit? This is my first year at Coastal as a serious student going into next semester but I have come and seen some celebration lectures with friends/ex girlfriends before. They were pretty sweet. What if we put together a few of us and submitted a proposal to do a lecture on reddit and broke down what good can become of it and also mention our growing subreddit. Does anyone else think this is a good idea? I believe right now is proposal time. I do not really know how celebration works. Can someone clue me in? Thanks. \n\nSome perks of reddit\n\nUser based content.\nModerated content by verifed professionals\nThe up/down vote hivemind\n\n\nI am by no means an expert on this, stringbean said something about majoring in redditology maybe as a joke but this might work.... people HAVE to go to celebration.... I would go to one on reddit if I had heard about it, hear about r/ccu and subscribe and then we might have a nice size group posting and sharing things.",

The acts of kindness found on reddit are second to none. \n\nhttp://www.coastal.edu/inquiry/2012/about.html\n\n",

I think we should incorporate an array of good websites in this lecture though to perhaps draw attention away from such websites as Facebook. \n\nI did a celebration of inquiry presentation once on Zeitgeist: Addendum. It was pretty easy to do. I submitted a form online, signed up for a slot and showed up the day of to show the video and held a discussion afterward. ",

Because reddit might be the least used site on campus, it was not even on the list of internet social networks posted in the library. If you want to front something I would help gather research. There are a lot of parts of reddit that are just amazing. University of Reddit, and random acts of pizza, theory of reddit even provides a lot of data about how reddit functions. I would be willing to help people I just hate fronting things. I used to put myself into a lot of leadership positions but eventually grew to understand that real leaders lead from behind. And now I want to teach instead. This topic is pretty awesome. ",

I have only been an active redditor for about 9 months or so now but was lurking over a year ago. It appears tho that the other mod is an old school redditor and might be the best source of information. I am mostly in love with the idea of reddit more than the content itself. I think the world should be open source and user generated. ",

When I was in his marketing class, he used an overhead and never used a projector/computer.  However, when approached by a few marketing majors, he agreed that Coastal needs a social media marketing course.\n\nIf a professor as old-school as overhead-using AJ Taylor says we need a course that focuses on social media marketing, it's clearly something that should be discussed.  Social media has changed the world as we know it.",

    "postText": "I'm either going to be attending this fall or next spring. Computer science major, spent the past 3 years in community college (New Jersey) so I have college experience and understand how to get things done in college for the most part. So I'm just looking for CCU-specific advice opposed to general college advice.\n\nCool/fun things to do? Places to hang out (off/on campus)? Meeting new people. If you're a computer science major, any good teachers vs. bad teachers? What are the learning environments like? etc.\n\nI'll be living off campus in Little River so it's about a 20 min drive when there's no traffic. I don't have to worry about RA's or any dorm regulations (which is good because I enjoy alcohol and trees a lot).\n\nI'm also going to need a job to support myself. I toured there during spring break and was told about some program where you can apply/find a job through the college. Anybody have any experience with that? good or bad?\n\nAny advice is appreciated thank you :D\n\nEDIT: When I say going to be attending, that's assuming I get accepted. I have a ~3.0 gpa and &gt;24 transferable credits but my associates is for graphic design/web development, not computer science. Any speculation on my odds?",

I expect it will suck in traffic but my mom owns a house there which she only uses a couple days out of the month so I'll have my own place with no rent. Also no need to get drunk in the woods cause I'll have a private home for that and am 21 haha.\n\nBesides, being from NJ, the South Carolina wilderness might as well be fucking Australia with all the creepy critters you got lol.",

Casselman is heavily invested in marketing, software engineering, and web development. Other professors delve into database maintaining, system administration, hardware, efficiency, and so much more.\n\nSeriously talk to all the professors and find out what part of computer science you want to explore. Find a professor that specializes in that topic and then ask them to be your adviser. \n\nI'm not sure how your community college credits will transfer.",

If that's the case, Casselman is a great person to talk to since he teaches the web-design classes and really knows his way around that field. However, there are only a few web-design type courses (maybe only two?) and if you have transfer credit for them, you may not have the chance to have a class with him. That being said, there isn't a professor in the department who won't speak freely with you about all manner of things if you stop by their office.\n\nAs for other professors, talk to these people about these things:\n\n* Dr. Murphy - GNU/Linux related stuff\n* Dr. Jones - Hardware and high-performance computing\n* Dr. Larkins - Programming languages and robotics\n* Dr. French - Image processing\n* Dr. Casselman - The Internet\n\nThere aren't that many of us in the department, but we're growing. If you wind up at the Coastal Science Center in the Fall, I'll be the tall bearded red-head. Feel free to introduce yourself.",

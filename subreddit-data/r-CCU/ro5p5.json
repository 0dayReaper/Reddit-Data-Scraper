    "postText": "As you guys/girls might know, I am graduating in May with a B.S. in Marketing and Management.  I'm strongly considering starting up a company for digital marketing.  I am working through the costs and potential clients and possible competition right now.\n\nI have a decent amount of knowledge in information systems, but I'm looking for someone with more knowledge and a passion to succeed.  I need someone who can help create a website for me, edit websites for clients, has a basic understanding of SEO (not entirely necessary, we can go over that).\n\nHTML, Java, Flash, HTML5 are the kinds of knowledge I'm looking for.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to generate experience out of college, or even if you're still in college (while making money) and I'm not requiring professional experience in this field.\n\nThis might be something that I contract out, to create my site, for a one-time fee.  Or, if you're interested, we can discuss a long-term employment opportunity.\n\nI know how hard it is to get a job in this economy without professional experience and that's why I'm willing to help you.  If this sounds like something of interest for you, please PM me your email and we will continue discussions through that.  Please have a resume ready to send.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can post them in this thread, as well.\n\nThanks and I look forward to hearing from you!",

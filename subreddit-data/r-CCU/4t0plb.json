I'm interested if anyone knows whether or not there are any homeless college students on campus? I know some homeless college students can stay in dorms, but often have no place to go during the summer or holidays.\n\nFeel free to email me at cboschult@thesunnews.com or call me on my cell at 512-818-4294 or my desk line at 843-626-0218 \n\nThanks,\nChristian Boschult ",

I could PM you that professor's name and contact info if you wish.\n\nAlso probably not what you're looking for, but many of the off campus student housing apartments force the students who don't renew out of the apartment before the end of July, and won't let them come back until the semester starts, so many of these students have to crash on friends couches for up to 2-3 weeks",

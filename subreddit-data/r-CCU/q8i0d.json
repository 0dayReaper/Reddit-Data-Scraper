    "postText": "First of all, don't act like you are doing us a favor by rising the out of state tuition by \"only\" 2.some percent instead of 6 some percent. This whole thing that college is a business is messed up. America needs to change its mentality on this real quick or else we will have a bunch of mindless zombies attempting to claw their way out of thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nAlso, don't try and appease me, the in-state people with a $50 dollar credit. Thanks, that pays for a tank of gas and a half of gas (a weeks worth of gas). Maybe. Maybe not by the time the new semester starts.\n\n[Edit: For those who didn't get the email, here is a copy of it.]\nCCU trustees revise out-of-state tuition rates\n \n            At a specially called teleconference meeting today, the Board of Trustees of Coastal Carolina University voted to revise an earlier decision on out-of-state tuition for the 2012-2013 academic year.\n            Instead of a flat 5.75 percent increase for all out-of-state students\u2014the rate approved at the board's regular meeting last Friday\u2014the board today approved the new wording \"an increase of up to 5.75 percent.\" The motion allows the University administration the flexibility to set rates for each program based on costs.\n            Following the motion, the University administration announced that undergraduate out-of-state rates will be increased by 2.3 percent for the next academic year, from $10,780 to $11,025 per semester\u2014which is $750 less per year than the rate approved at last week's meeting. The 2.3 percent increase corresponds to the Higher Education Price Index.\n            It was also announced that out-of-state tuition for graduate students will increase 5.75 percent next year, from $690 per credit hour to $730 per credit hour. Rates for out-of-state students in the Master of Business Administration and Master of Accountancy programs will increase from $795 per credit hour to $840 per credit hour.\n            \"After careful review of our tuition situation and in view of the economic climate facing our students, Board Chairman Wyatt Henderson called for a special meeting to reset out-of-state tuition rates next year to keep costs down for students,\" said CCU President David A DeCenzo. \"The decisions today will improve Coastal Carolina University's competitive position in the marketplace.\"\n            The board decided last week not to increase undergraduate in-state tuition for next year, and all in-state resident undergraduate students will receive a $50 per semester credit on their tuition bill. Housing fees and meal fees will also remain at the 2011-2012 level.",

Over on bumfucknowhere 501, (trust me, I'd rather be there than on Main Campus, I kinda hate almost everyone who goes to CCU) we have a decaying building with outdated computers, printers, and machines. I don't really see any improvements to my education or tools that are supposed to aid me in my education. Until I see progress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one with these thoughts, why should I have to pay more?\n\nIt is bad enough that they charge me a shit ton for parking, and as a commuter who lives 40+ minutes, I'm hardly guaranteed a spot anywhere near my classes (I don't mind the walk though) whereas the fucks from UP who can see the school from their damn dorms and have access to a shuttle can take up the \"VIP\" parking. Point of that rant being -- they are charging out the ass for parking as well, when they should make improvements, or policy changes before they do that. They are trying to hatch chickens before the eggs are even laid.",

                            "comment": "First, the construction costs are actually being paid by a penny sales tax throughout the county. (Horry County Schools gets the majority of the funds and HGTC gets a slice too). As far as the situation in the Comp Sci Department, the department has had some issues in the past that I won't repeat here but you can ask around and find out that caused the monetary situation to be out of whack.  Unfortunately in this economy costs have risen and the State has the past few years cut funding to higher education across the board. As a result, Coastal has had to raise tuition to cover the difference. \n\nAnother thing you mentioned is the parking situation. I've been around Coastal for going on 12 years now. The only \"VIP\" parking I know of is the lot near Singleton and Prince that's reserved and the spots for the Deans. I know UP folks get different stickers, but I don't know that they get special parking. So I looked it up:\n\nCommuter -- Commuters may park in any space designated for students. They may not park in Faculty/Staff, Visitor, Handicap or \nReserved spaces.\n\nMain Campus Residents -- RESIDENT students may park in the dorm area lots only. Vehicles bearing RESIDENT decals are prohibited in any other lots on campus Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nUniversity Place -- Students with a UNIV PLACE parking permit may park at University Place and on campus in lots BB, EE (surrounding Waccamaw), the Elvington Lot, the Atlantic Center Lot, the Baxley Hall overflow lot and the University Blvd. parking lot (adjacent to Student Health Services).\n\nSo it actually looks like they have fewer places to park.  More lots are planned and I know it's slow, but that's how things work. If you donated $50 million today for a new building it would still have to go through the State approval process which takes a year minimum but usually more before a building is planned and construction can start. \n\nTL:DR -- Coastal was designed to be a commuter school for locals. Changes are being made, but they are slow. ",

The walk from the new lot to ANYWHERE on campus is so short in comparison. I also have walked from my house (9 miles to coastal). Complaining about parking is insane. People are lucky they have cars!! ",

Clemson is $134 and CofC if upwards of $600 per year and for both of these places don't guarantee front door parking. USC charges $70 a year so we're right in line with them.\n\nHowever, I am irritated about tuition increase, but I do understand it and am thankful it's less than they thought it would be. I think that the $50 credit they're giving to in-states should go to reducing our tuition hike. But the school, since it is public, receives funding for in-state students. ",

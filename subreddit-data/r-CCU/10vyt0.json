    "postText": "Hello fellow CCU students!\n\nWe now have a couple of new mods for this subreddit to take the place of agiantgreenlump - Inappropriate_Seuss and prive8. I'm certain they will both make great additions to this subreddit! And speaking of additions and improvements...\n\nI've seen a lot of posts on how we can promote this subreddit to the faculty, staff, and student body of CCU. Many have already made suggestions such as flyers, etc, but is there anything else that you all can think of? I will admit, I don't have the time to promote this myself. Between work and school, I have very little free time. But if someone knows a way to promote it, lets hear it! Maybe you know someone who does work with one of the many student publications on campus? Maybe you have an option to put a link on one of the CCU websites. Anything that can drive people to this subreddit and generate content is much appreciated :)\n\nGood day to you all!",

For example, you get to register for classes before everyone else, meaning you get first pick of classes rather than last (which is what other freshman get). You also get access to some classes with honors instructors which are selected because of their high quality teaching. There are actually lots of benefits. One of the cons is that if you don't stick with it, you really won't have anything on your transcript to show for it.",

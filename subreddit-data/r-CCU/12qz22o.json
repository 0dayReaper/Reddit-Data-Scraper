    "postText": "Hello this is my first post on this subreddit\n\nI am asking for advice as I am an advanced math student in High School, I am taking AP Calc AB right now and am doing very strong in the class usually setting the curve for the multiple choice practice as well as scoring 9 on most of our practice FRQs. \nMy predicament is that I am a junior (11th Grade) and I have no math class to take next year as I have taken the most advanced math course offered at my High School. So I plan to take Calc II and Calc III at Coastal Carolina University next year as I plan to Major in Mathematics at the University of South Carolina - Columbia.\nThe Advice I need is whether or not to take Math 220, Mathematical Proofs and Prob Sol, which will transfer to USC as Math 300, Transition to Advanced Mathematics as well as CSCI 140, Intro to Algorithmic Design I, which translates to USC as CSCE 145, Algorithmic Design I.\nIf I take all four, I would take Calc II and Intro to Algorithmic Design I first semester, and Calc III and Mathematical Proofs and Prob Sol second semester because one of the Math 300 requirements is that your have completed Calc II. \nFor Context I have been told by my AP Calc Teacher that I should do it and she is a great teacher, 100% passage rate and the majority of students scoring a 5, but I need advice from people that have taken these courses and are more familiar with them.\nIf all classes are taken and passed I would start USC taking my semester 1 junior math class with a 500 rating or 700 with permission, I will most likely ask for permission to take the 700 rating course because I plan to go on to get my masters and then doctorate in Math.\n\nAnyways any and all advice is appreciated \n\nYours in Math,\nLiam Perry",

That being said that class is what made me fall in love with it.\n\nCalc 2 is great, it's where clac gets real fun, and calc 3 is where it gets more applied.  A REALLY great class if it transfers and is still offered is intro to operations research, basically an applied linear algebra that gets into some of the really cool things that can be proved out (supply chains etc.) from what I remember calc 1 was the only requirement.  \n\nHope my old brain remembered things well enough to be of some help.\n\nEdit: looks like Jim Solazzo is still working there.  He is a really great professor and super nice guy. You should reach out and get his thoughts, I'm sure he can provide significantly more insight than I can.",

I'm not sure what language they are teaching 140 in these days, but it may be worth asking Will Jones or Jeanie French if you want to get ahead of the curve.  Having a baseline understanding of the launguge will make the first portion of the class really straight forward, and make it a lot easier when you start getting into the more advanced section.\n\nWhen I took it, 140 had a bit of a rep of being a little intense compared to the future classes as it was kindof a baseline gate to unlock all the other compsci classes.  Again, not sure if that is still the case, but having that solid math and programming experience going into it will signinficantly reduce the intensity.",

            "comment": "I'm just seeing this as this sub is kinda dead. But, 140 is your basic intro to programming/algorithms. They teach Python now instead of Java (not sure why they did this as I loved Java) which is a much easier language IMO. So I'd familiarize with Python before beginning. If you already have a knack for math/critical thinking, then it won't be much trouble at all, as most of the heavy stuff comes up in CSCI150 (data structures, OOP, etc). I stopped at calc 2/discrete math, so I can't speak on the math courses.",

Then I'll move on to Prototype and Prototype 2.  Then I need to restart and then finally complete Fallout: New Vegas.  After that, I'll probably throw it old school with some Super Mario RPG and classic computer games.  I also need to finish Demon's Souls, and I know it probably won't happen before they take the servers down, which will make things much more difficult.  lol\n\nHowever, I'm at work right now, so when I'm done browsing Reddit, I plan to break out the GBA SP and play some Pok\u00e9mon.",

I might get a desktop for DIII if I get a good summer job, otherwise im done with gaming for a while. I really used to love Civilization and Age of Empires tho.  ",

Wineskin is free, Crossover is paid, but it is easier for quick installs and get right to playing.  It also comes with the support you pay for.",

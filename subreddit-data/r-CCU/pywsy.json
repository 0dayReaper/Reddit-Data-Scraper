I'm a senior and still have class with people who don't know their limit.  One of my classmates this past weekend got blackout drunk and punched a wall, breaking his arm.  It never pays to go full retard.  I'm not a big drinker or partier, so I luckily don't have that temptation to drink that much.\n\nI'd also advise that you get involved with clubs on campus of your interest.  It's a good way to meet new people and grow close relationships.  I know the whole \"get involved\" thing is overplayed, but it's true; getting involved is good for you and looks good on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.",

Every semester, we have a club recruitment day, though, so you'll be able to explore each club's booth and find out what they are about and get involved.  Some clubs also have a freshman recruiting event during the freshman week.  I know my car club was advertising membership two years ago during freshman week.",

Also, you have no room to fail in any of your classes. I think it is a great program, but you have to make sure you are committed to it though.",

There aren't as many events when it comes to smaller colleges and clubs tend to be smaller, but I just enjoy the fact of walking across campus and seeing a friend or having the opportunity of having the same class as a friend be much more likely since the population is smaller.\n\nWhen you walk on the main campus in the center during a good day in Spring and you can't help but think to yourself, \"holy crap. this is what college looks like (in a good way).\" You have people laying in circles in the green grass, people walking barefoot, skateboarding riding around and stuff. Looks like one of those stock photos in a brochure.\n\nAlso, going for the cheaper route was best in my opinion. I lived locally in Myrtle Beach so naturally it was cheaper for me to pick CCU over Clemson (my other choice). While the concept of moving to Clemson would be awesome, realistically it isn't money-wise. I have friend who are racking up the bills by going to a more expensive school, and the only difference is going to be the name of the university. I've learned that how successful you are outside of your degree is more based on your networking and internships and work experience instead of the university name and GPA. Plus, I learned that Clemson's CompSci department was lackluster so overall I feel confident in my choice.",

We're in the business school, which is actually highly respected and we will graduate with a BS in business administration, as opposed to many other schools getting a BA in business administration.  It's a subtlety, but a BS is a more respected degree, as the science aspect indicates that the curriculum was more technical and in-depth.  Wall is also AACSB accredited.",

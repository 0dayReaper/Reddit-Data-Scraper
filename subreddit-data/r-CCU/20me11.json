            "comment": "I did some school hopping, but finished up with a degree in Computer Science from CCU. I do not regret my decision to finish my degree there instead of Clemson.\n\n**Pros**\n\n1. Good teacher to student ratio.\n1. Good degree programs.\n1. Reasonable tuition. It's been going up, but is still pretty affordable. Check College of Charleston, too.\n1. Good facilities. It's not all the latest and greatest, but there have been a lot of upgrades/new construction relatively recently.\n1. Plentiful student services. Between the various tutoring services and career services, the hardest part about getting your money's worth is finding the time to go see all the different helpful people on campus.\n1. Nice weather.\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. Not very prestigious. While it certainly has several highly ranked/rated programs and provides a good education, lack of name recognition may hurt you in some fields early on in your job hunt. Later, this seems to matter much less.\n1. Highly variable student quality. Take this with a grain of salt, or debate at your leisure, but while I was at Clemson, I could *generally* count on any random person in any random class of mine to be pretty sharp. While I was at Coastal, the high caliber students seemed like high caliber students anywhere else, but the low caliber students were much worse, and which type of student your classmates would be classified as seemed largely unpredictable.\n1. Highway 501. It is a nightmare, manifest as infrastructure, and realized as traffic congestion and poor decision making. Abandon all hope, ye who drive here.",

I don't think Coastal hurt my chances, but Clemson and USC still have more weight behind their names, especially around SC.\n\nAnd again, after the first job, unless you went to the same school as the person interviewing you, nobody seems to care where you went.\n\nSince OP provided no details, I figured it was worth mentioning.",

The cops are plentiful but for the most part didn't bother students that weren't being completely out of hand. The biggest thing most people don't realize when attending CCU is that the campus is not beach front. There's a surprising amount of people that don't realize the ocean is still 15-20 mins away. Good luck with wherever you choose to attend. ",

Coastal has some really strong programs like Marine Science and the business school but then also some weak ones. \n\nHas a business student I have loved coastal. It's all about getting involved and networking. You might not have the same opportunities at first as going to a big name school or being in a huge city but if you get involved you will have an awesome time while also opening up a lot of opportunities. I will be graduating is May from coastal and have been highly involved around campus so AMA. \n",

It is one of less then 25 colleges with a Professional Golf Management degree.  \n\n2. Resort Tourism Management is really good since we are in a tourist area with a lot of hotels/resorts that offer prestigious internships to students. \n\n3. (My favorite reason) There are a lot of ex CEOs or business professionals that retire and move the Myrtle Beach area. Some of these people end up picking up a few classes to teach at Coastal or get invited to events. Not only will you be learning from professors who have years of real world experience, but you will also have the opportunity to network with them and use them as references. Like I said in my previous post if you get involved this will help your chances.\n\n4. The average class size I would say is 30 students (give or take). Freshman year I had some big ones with 60+ students but has you progress the classes get smaller. This allows you to make a connection with your professor where they actually know your name after a week of class. Some might have even heard of you before the class begins. If you use that to your advantage it can help you out a lot. \n ",

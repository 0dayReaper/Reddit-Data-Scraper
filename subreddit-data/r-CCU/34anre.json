My major's department and career services couldn't help me(no internships, job opportunities, or connections).  \nI have finally found one and it pays $27k/yr.  \nIs this normal for CCU grads? I have seen many working fast food and have been worried the degree from CCU didn't mean much since then.",

            "comment": "Also CCU alumnus w/ STEM major here. I was really active in undergrad research and interning and graduated w/ a job offer. It didn't pay very much, but it was better than nothing. My adviser at CCU never recommended that I take part in research or an internship. These were all things I realized I should get involved in while a sophomore. I run into CCU alumni every now and then, and most feel the same way.  When I got to grad school, I realized that students from other schools are WAY more active in their fields than we were able to be. CCU definitely has a rep for partying and not being taken seriously, but it's still growing and slowly gaining respect. \n\nI loved my time there, and am proud to represent it. I feel like if you downplay where your degree comes from, then others will follow suit. It's still a young university with lots of potential and growing to do. Give it some time. \n\nAlso congrats on your job! If you're looking into getting out of MB, and headed to Charleston, PM me. Maybe I can help on the job front. ",

The professors didn't help me when I asked for it and, even when I lived outside their office, some weren't much help on the material they taught.  \nI later found out that the other students In my graduating class were all working together and chipped in on an online answer service. This was why they did so well even though they had no idea what was going on. :/    \nI have 3 years of research experience at the university(it was like pulling teeth and 2 years of it didn't get credit). I was also misadvised for 4 years which delayed my graduation.   \n  \nLastly, I wasn't treated well where I worked on campus by other departments. I was seen as beneath them and not worthy of their respect. One employee above me was verbally abusive(I did submit complaints).   ",

Sad because the majority of people that go to CCU plan to stay at Myrtle beach for the beach, but you'd probably find much better opportunities in Charleston, Greenville or Charleston. I love Myrtle beach but again, not somewhere where you'll find a high paying career. ",

If in MB my guess is 27k is close to average. \n\nTo give you some perspective I moved to NYC after graduating last year and got a job making 30k base plus 25k uncapped commission (pretty much guaranteed). NYC has also one of the highest cost of living in the country where MB is probably below avg. I was also hired along with Ivy League grads so one can argue a CCU degree is worth as much as an Ivy leagues. \n\nI'd like to point out that I was a business major and not STEM so that could be a reason as well. As far as career services or my college helping me I didn't get any help at all. What I think helped me the most was my involvement in different uncampus organizations and internships I had while in school.\n\nGood luck!\n\n",

By the time I left about 4.5 years later I was making just $45k.\n\nMB wages are notoriously low. There aren't many jobs here, especially in STEM fields, so there's no need for many employers to pay a premium. Cost of living is really low (a good thing) which means you can get by on less compared to a larger area.\n\nWhat you're running into isn't necessarily a CCU problem. It's a new grad problem, especially an MBA grad. CCU has its faults, but they seem to be moving in the right direction. It's much better now than it was from what I've gathered.",

    "postText": "Some background:\n\n* He used to smoke in the apartment once every one to two months. In the last two weeks he's started doing it on a daily basis. Sometimes more. I think it's because of a new girlfriend.\n\n* I was assigned housing as a freshman and had no control over my roommates.\n\n* He smokes it in his bathroom which is connected to a shower which in turn is connected to my bathroom.\n\n* It's a four person/room apartment.\n\n* only one other person has even mentioned the smell.\n\n* I can smell it in my room and in the living room for a good 15-30 minutes after he smokes.\n\nI don't want him kicked out of coastal for using weed. I don't think it should be illegal. I just want to know if I can get into any trouble because of this. If the answers yes I'll confront him about it.",

When I was a freshman my RA was from India. There was no fooling her, nor did she care, because where she is from weed is not illegal, it is worshipped shared and grows wild. Life outside of American perspective is awesome. ",

            "comment": "I'm a former RA and yes, you can very well get in trouble. If there is any illegal activity in your room (drinking, etc) and it is found out, anyone in the room at the time gets in trouble. (Even if they are asleep or in the shower, though you can fight it which I suggest in those cases.) If he gets caught when you are not in the room, though, I am honestly not sure about what could happen to you. \n\nI can understand why you don't want to report him. My suggestion is try talking to him about it in a non confrontational way at first, and if he refuses to change it, be more stern. If he still disregards you, maybe try finding new housing for the rest of the semester if you wish. Also, I'm not sure he'll get kicked out of coastal for sure, but he would get kicked out of housing. I haven't been an RA for a year now so I'm not totally up-to-date on all of the rules.\n\nGood luck and keep us updated.",

I don't do it myself, because I've got a job that does test.  It really doesn't have adverse effects, long term.  Provided he is using it recreationally, in his free time, and not smoking then going to class or something stupid, I see nothing wrong with it.",

That was some really awesome stuff.\n\nEven though the festivities are under way, and there's still an hour left, I'd like to formally invite you all over to your new sub! Welcome to the Sun Belt and the FBS.\n\nI've already rolled out the welcome mat, adding you into the header and flair selector, so just click subscribe!\n\nHere's to the future of Teal Nation! Go Chants!",

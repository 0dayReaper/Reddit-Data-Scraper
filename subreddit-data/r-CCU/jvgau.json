    "postText": "Reddit is a great community. I would not be surprised to find that there is a small section of the student population that lurks sometimes but has not thought to look for r/CCU. This is a new year with new students. We are given a subreddit to devote to a huge demographic of people (CCU students, faculty and friends) who all want to network and share information. There are tons of artists, bands, writers, scientists, and graphic design people at coastal who create and have interesting things that I think we could all benefit from seeing. Here is my plan on how we (The few members of this subreddit) can promote and grow a real community with little real effort. \n\n1)SUBSCRIBE\n2) Content - We need to start encouraging our friends and ourselves to upload content onto the page. Once the page has things to view there will be a purpose to mention it.\n3) Deliverance - Tell people about it and give them the site, once I discovered Reddit I was hooked. I never used 4chan or digg prior to its discovery. I have no reason to even want to. It was so easy to set up and use and navigate. It has a random buttom that takes you to the most insane subreddits you can imagine and it will provide a free and open forum that I think Coastal students want. If you go to the CCU facebook page they have the wall disabled. Beyond that Blackboard is the only means of communication. \n4) Submit links about Bacon. Mega lulz. \n\n\n\nTL;DR... \nFrontpage the subreddit or die. Post something on the frontpage or GTFO. People don't know about r/CCU? Better drink my own piss.... ",

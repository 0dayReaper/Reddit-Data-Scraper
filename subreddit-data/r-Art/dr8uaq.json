I lived in the Middle East for 4 years and this is giving me maaaaaajpr nostalgia.\n\nEverything about this picture is so accurate in ways I never even consciously realized. The slide-up door thing. The hole-in-the-wall restaurants. The external AC unit. The decorative iron window cover. The power/cable cords dangling down on the outside of the building. The cracking exterior. The Coca-Cola (or other companies) on store signs!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that might be different is that I'm not sure they used Masonry for the bones where I lived. Everything else is so freaking accurate it's crazy.\n\nOn top of all that, it just looks gorgeous.\n\nEven in the Middle East, we saw Urdu script on some buildings owned by Pakistanis or aimed toward their market. What's cooking, Biryani?! :p",

Trying pixel art actually led to what my job is now.\n\nMy friend worked for a game dev startup and they were having trouble creating pixel art for a game. I always wanted to try pixel art so I made an asset for them. It was an orange mustang. That landed me a job in the same company. I worked on that game for about 6 months or so and loved doing pixel art. That was 2012 and I never got the time to continue doing it on my own, until now :)",

The title of this post should therefore have been \"Untitled\", not \"Pulled Over\", as that is something OP just made up -- unless there is another source to validate this title, of course.\n\nI'm going to leave this up so we don't get a million reposts, but in the future please be sure to accurately title other artists' works.\n\n[Edit]  The artist has since updated his Instagram feed to say that \"Pulled Over\" is the actual title of the work.",

Meaning you work from light (the paper) to dark (the color) making things darker as you add more and more color.\n\nThat means that highlights (the brightest parts) should be untouched paper. And only paper because water colors only work on paper surfaces that can absorb the water.\n\nNext, there isn\u2019t a white water color, because watercolors are transparent/translucent.\n\nOils, Pastels, gauche, acrylics (sometimes) etc. are all opaque, and because of that you typically work in the other direction, putting down shadows first and the building highlights on top.\n\nWith all that in mind, I can see that the brightest colors are were put on top of the darker colors as strokes (see the long stroke representing the window, or the beads of sweat) so it is def not watercolors.\n\nWith no consistent paper/surface texture shadows I can tell it is digital.",

You have to approach them and plan your piece in a totally different, almost backwards way.\n\nThe good news is that you can quickly do color study practice runs of your piece. Print out thumbnail copies of a sketch and try out different colors/shades first before doing the final piece.\n\nA lot of artist use watercolors for color studies as prep work for an oil painting because the setup / cleanup time is really small.\n\nAnd you are allowed to finish with some opaque paints (white) or colored pencil on top.",

In Tulsa there were armed people on balconies firing at cars full of armed people firing back. Farmers got in planes and dropped firebombs on buildings. The mobs heald back firemen so they couldn't stop the fires... that is a race riot that became a massacre... and that's where I'm worried we're heading if something isn't done to curb police violence.",

Nice to see that it's back.\n\nAlso, again, this is technically \"collage\" or \"photomanipulation\" and not \"photography\".  If anyone else chooses to post another portrait of Vladimir Putin made from hundreds of small flaccid penises, please keep this in mind.\n\nEdit:  In case anyone is wondering, this is now the all-time top /r/Art post.  Well done.  Next time someone complains about the lack of male nudity in this sub I'll just say, [\"Hey, are *you* in for a treat.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all)",

I guess I did too, before getting way too deep into it.\n\n&gt; we'd likely need electricity to manufacturer, develop, and print\n\nOn that front though, all current manufacturers of film do use electricity for that (because duh) but I'm pretty sure you could put together low-sensitivity black and white film without it. Developing requires none of it, you have to heat color chemistry a little but you can do black and white at room temp perfectly well, and for printing/enlarging, you just need to repeat the same with a light in your enlarger. People used to do it with candles back in the 19th century, it's definitely possible to complete the process with no electricity at all.",

Google Eric wert and he has some stuff out there showing the whole process from set up to photography to layout to actually doing the painting.   He\u2019s doing still lifes, I\u2019m not sure of this artists process.  It looks to me like it could have been made using a projector which is fine for the general shape of things but if you use it to do the whole painting you\u2019re doing some highly technical stuff but you\u2019re right it doesn\u2019t seem fulfilling",

Like I can *feel* it and I like that. It\u2019s also cool to zoom in and realize you *can* see brush strokes and such. I just like the overall ambiance of this, doesn\u2019t look like an accidental photo at all to me.

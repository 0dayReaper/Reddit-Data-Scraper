He has compiled different photos, stock images and renders together and used a lot of effects and different techniques, probably designed some of the signs and stuff, maybe modeled the cat and the boy, to achieve the final look you see in this picture. \n\nNot gonna lie to you - this is exceedingly difficult, especially at this size, and still needs a LOT of freehand work. You can tell when somebody does this stuff right just by seeing how much attention he puts into realizing and enhancing details by hand, not just slapping stuff together, correcting some colors and then calling it a day. \n\nIf you want to start working on stuff like this, use GIMP or Photosphop if you have the spare money, fire the program up and watch some tutorials. And always remember: the first step at being sorta good at something is sucking at it. ",

The best artists I know made it a habit to draw almost everytime they have a few minutes to kill, in the bus, on the train, at the station, whenever other people whip out their phones they doodle around a bit - of course not all the time, every time, but most of it anyway. I think that's the trick: make it a habit, like smoking. Just without the cancer.\n\nHowever, for /u/CasualAustrian: Whereas it certainly helps a lot to know how to draw if you want to create pictures like Chinatown, painting skills are much more valuable. Of course, both are tied together, yet you should know something about colors, about shapes and composition if you want to attempt PS art. Not on the level of Picasso, mind, but on a decent level, especially since you still have to paint a lot of things and details by hand, which no program on earth can do for you.\n\nThis is why this look is so hard achieve: it sits at the crossroads between several different skillsets: you should know your programs, you should know a bit how to paint, how to draw, how to compose colors and frame pictures. But one can get the hang of it, with practice. ",

I had an interview the next morning, and they had put me up in a hotel in midtown, right by Koreatown. \n\nI was supposed to be sleeping hard to be energetic for my interview, but I simply couldn't! I kept looking out of my window at the traffic down Park Avenue, the lights going on and off in the office buildings. It was as intoxicating as basking in the smoke of a thousand cigarettes. \n\nI took that job, and thought real hard for three years about what that feeling was. I'd see glimpses of it when I went up Rockefeller center, or walked across the Brooklyn Bridge, or went to the Halloween parade.\n\nI think it's about observing a megalopolis that is very very alive and loud, from the calm and quiet of your mind. All these seemingly random processes that make up the city life are somehow so coordinated that they don't affect each other. And they don't have to affect you if you don't want it to. \n\nIt's like watching a big beautiful lion walk around, except there's no part of your monkey brain that is screaming danger or needing you to be alert.

This sense of your own quiet corner in a busy world, unburdened by the need to go and *do* something. A moment of relaxation at night where the world still turns, the people still move, but *you* don't have to.\n\nIt's one of those sensations that we feel like wallowing in because it's like a warm bath, away from the troubles of the world, comfortable. The image captures that feeling, and pulls you in there. The details aren't important, though you might also be intrigued by the cyberpunk world which is at once both familiar and alien. I don't think you'd have been as interested if you were in a hurry to do something, but you probably were just browsing Reddit to relax (or on compulsion) so you had time to *feel* the piece.\n\nEDIT: typo fixes",

A recurring theme in Portuguese and Brazilian literature, saudade evokes a sense of loneliness and incompleteness. Portuguese scholar Aubrey Bell attempts to distill this complex concept in his 1912 book In Portugal, describing saudade as \u201ca vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present.\u201d He continues to say that saudade is \u201cnot an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness.\u201d Saudade can more casually be used to say that you miss someone or something, even if you\u2019ll see that person or thing in the near future. ***It differs from nostalgia in that one can feel saudade for something that might never have happened***, whereas nostalgia is \u201ca sentimental yearning for the happiness of a former place or time.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/e/portuguese-terms/\n\n",

But so many people dismiss certain works of art because they don\u2019t make automatic sense or they aren\u2019t \u201cof\u201d anything.\n\nThe true value in art is the feeling you\u2019re describing. I hate when people dismiss the types who will stand and observe a piece that doesn\u2019t necessarily say or even depict anything. They\u2019re taking it all in. So many emotions ranging from warmth to weird senses of nostalgia to a scary yet comforting feeling that you can sometimes experience for the very first time looking at a work of art. They can literally make you feel ways you\u2019ve never felt before, even if it may just look like a mess of color to others.\n\nI\u2019ve always been very into art of all kinds from street art to mind bending Dali-esque works to historical portraits to completely abstract pieces. I was once one of those people that rolled my eyes at those art snob jerks sipping their wine and trying to interpret a \u201cwork of art\u201d that looks like the artist just threw up on the canvas. But one day, after being overcome with emotion while looking at a work of art, this realization clicked. And ever since then, it\u2019s so much easier to truly appreciate art. To stand back and let it engulf me in my own interpretation.\n\nSorry for rambling..I just really wish more people would understand what I\u2019m trying to say",

Art is not always 100% accessible for all people, and that's fine.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that, and if you'd like to understand that art, feel free to go study it.

I listen to mostly future bass which in it's current state has a lot of vocals with little or no actual lyrics or the same one or two lines over and over, but they're still among my favourite part because while they have very little literal meaning, they still have a lot of emotion. The literal meaning of a word isn't always why it's used in the lyrics. Sometimes things like the progression of the word (eg; \"start\" begins soft, then has a hard sounding \"t\", then a vowel that can be drawn out, then a hard finish with the other \"t\") is much more important. So when people complain about the lack of meaningful lyrics in the genre, it's because there's more to it than just the definitions and the rhyming.

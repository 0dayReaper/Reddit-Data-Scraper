It took months to get a reservation and even then, only those individuals with the finest manners were allowed to dine there. \n\nAmanda had been waiting for eleven months. She'd won a gift card in a potion contest and had eagerly counted the days to when she could go. She had even brushed up on fine dining etiquette and dressed her one of her non-scorched marked dresses. \n\nShe arrived three minutes early to her reservation and was promptly brought to her table where she ordered her favourite dish, and the one the cafe was famous for: Creme Brulee. As she sat, a waiter brought her coffee, sugar, milk. He also placed the brulee on the table. Seconds later, another waiter appeared with a small green dragon curled perched upon a purple napkin. \n\nThe waiter stroked the small dragons back and it made a purring sound before the dragon spied the creme brulee and the waiter lowered his arm. The little dragon drew in a deep breath before he blew a small, blue, flame across the top, caramelizing the dessert. \n\nAmanda held her breath, her eyes wide, until the little dragon finished as sat back, giving a small cough; a little puff of smoke drifted from its mouth. The waiter stroked its back again. \n\n\"Enjoy,\" he said and slipped away back into the restaurant. \n\nAmanda picked up her spoon and gently scooped into the dessert, breaking the top of it. She brought it up to her mouth and took the bite, almost melting in her seat. It was delicious; smooth and sweet. No wonder the Wizard Cafe was famous across the twelve realms and it was worth the wait.",

Medieval vs. victorian in some way.\n\nIt also feels like it's a high terrace, one where you would be able to get to flying, I thought those were trees, maybe a 1st or 2nd story building, but then I saw what seems to be two figures in the background, suggesting it's at floor level and those are bushes. Again, the blurring in the background suggests a much bigger scale, as if it's far away, but then those figures make it look like a small town.\n\nGood work nonetheless, of course :)",

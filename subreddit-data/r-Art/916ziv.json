Do something that you enjoy so much that hours fly by without you noticing. It will be hard, but there will come a time where you won't think about her, and you'll realize it. In that moment you know you have moved on. Maybe not fully, but to the point where you see no reason to have her in your life again. Turn your situation into something you'll remember for the rest of you life. Make it be one of the turning points in your life where you can look back and say \"I'm so glad that situation happened, because I wouldn't be a better person because of it, or in a better life because of it.\" Without my hurdles with crazy exes, and exes who leave me for a guy she was always crazy about, I wouldn't be with the girl I love. The woman I am so proud of, and want to marry at some point. Someone who completes me, without having to rely on them heavily. I'm still in some tough situations, because shit has happened against me since I was 16. So please take my word, and my advice\n\nYou. Got. This.",

Obviously, we can't have 4.5 actual pixels, so what happens is in each pair of original pixels, one will be 4px and one will be 5px in the final image. You won't notice that unless you zoom in and look closely.\n\nIf you wanted to go from 320 to 480 without interpolation, you'd have to double every other pixel, which would be *very* noticeable.",

Using pixel art gives it a kind of nostalgic feel, the fall ambiance is serene and captures the feeling of something sweet and lively fading away.

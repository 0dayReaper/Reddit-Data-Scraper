To be honest, was never a Kobe or Lakers fan by any stretch, but when I saw how Kobe was with Gianna, how proud he was of her, how he balanced being a father and a mentor, how he explicitly said he didn't need a son to carry on his legacy because he has her -- those are what made me a fan of Kobe Bryant the father.  And I wanted to see how far his and Gianna's teamwork can take them, and the impact their/her success could have had on women's basketball. Now we'll never know, and that just saddens me to no end. It makes me wish that there really is a parallel universe out there where he, Gianna, her friend and everyone on that helicopter made it to the Mamba Academy, and today is just another Sunday for all of them.",

He was a travel parent.  She was a travel player.  She played basketball and her sister played volleyball.  \n\nThe older sister played in the same volleyball tournament my daughter did last year in February in AZ.  Videos of him sitting in the same folding chairs as the rest of us at the tournament just hit home with me.  I found out later he started mamba volleyball in 2018; same year I started our volleyball club in our town.  He was just like any other travel parent; wanting to give their kid the best experience they could.  \n\nRIP",

For many he was a teammate, a rival or an idol. Some people started playing because of him. Losing your hero, an icon, the heart of the sports of your city, can be though",

I'd assume that for many people Kobe was not just a good NBA player, but he was someone to look up to, an inspiration in sport and in other parts of life. Hell, perhaps some people had been more personally touched by them (maybe they directly benefited from his philanthropic foundation, etc.) and his death was like a loss of a sliver of their own life.\n\nI understand that there might be people who might attempt to relate to the tragedy for some personal clout, but, honestly, I think that gatekeeping emotions or telling people that they should not grieve or that they should grieve in some more appropriate manner is a fairly pointless endeavor.",

It's how artists respond to tragedy that moves them. They just.. make art. Maybe it seems weird to non artists, but it is pretty common.",

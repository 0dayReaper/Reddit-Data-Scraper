They were referring to these undercover police as 'ghosts' and they were mixed throughout the protesters trying to cause violence, one got caught (I think on purpose, with an I love the police shirt) and it really got people worked up. There are also likely undercover people meant to agitate the police too. Floods of messages on the stream of people saying to be like water or stay peaceful and not fall for any traps. It was pretty insane. No doubt there were people on the stream spreading sentiment telling people to fight or to leave, disguising themselves as concerned citizens.

            "comment": "**About the Hong Kong Protests:**\n\nIn April, the Hong Kong government introduced an extradition bill that would allow the extradition of its citizens to China. This was seen as a threat to Hong Kong's rule of law and freedom of speech, as China is known for arresting and censoring dissidents.\n\nDespite the many protests and criticisms regarding the bill, including marches in June where over a million, and two million people attended (as estimated by organizers), the government continues to refuse to withdraw the bill, only suspending it (meaning it can still be reintroduced).\n\nWith ever-increasing instances of excessive violence used by the police, the movement has now evolved into a campaign against police violence and unwanted Chinese influence.\n\n**The protestors have five demands:**\n\n1. Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill\n2. Retraction of the \"riot\" characterization of the protest on June 12\n3. Amnesty for all arrested protestors\n4. An independent committee to investigate the police\u2019s use of force\n5. Universal suffrage for Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections\n\nWhile Hong Kong is technically part of China, it is a special administrative region operating under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy, which was established when the UK returned Hong Kong to China. This means that Hong Kong is given a high degree of autonomy, where they have their own constitution known as the Basic Law. The city has entirely separate political and economic systems from China, and notably, a free and open internet.\n\nIn recent years, China has increased their influence on Hong Kong, using legal rulings to disqualify pro-democracy legislators, and refusing to allow universal suffrage in the election of the Chief Executive, despite it being promised in the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy.",

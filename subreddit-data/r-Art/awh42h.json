Sometimes there will be that one little cloud in that endless sea of blue. You'll be walking to work and you will ask that little cloud if they can just please block out the sun for 1 minute. That's all you need. Just 1 minute of shade. But it never comes to your aid. You get to work fully drenched in your own sweat and have to sit in the walk-in cooler of your work's kitchen for 15min to cool down. So yeah. I agree. Fuck sunny days.",

Actually it's the hardest thing to explain to someone, but the effect is compounding--and not just in the short term.  It becomes harder and harder as you get older, too.\n\nIt's not just the strength, though.  It's the dreams too.  That's the most insidious part--you can even lose your dreams to it, your inspiration, even your ability to think properly.  To make decisions, to *want* things.",

Would you say the same about piano? Would you expect to just naturally be able to play at a certain level, like you do with art? No, right? It's the same thing.

I teach a lot (lately mostly computer science) and what I find is natural talent gives you an advantage in the earliest hours of practice. So if a skill takes, say 1k hours to get good at and 10k to master, someone naturally talented might get a 20 hour advantage right at the very beginning. Doesn't count for a whole lot, *except* that it ties into the student's motivation and self confidence and can start a positive feedback loop.\n\nIn any case, I've never seen someone practice for 1000 hours and then fail, no matter what the skill (music, physics, math, programming). The only time I see someone fail is when they quit, right at the beginning.",

Playing Wonderwall on guitar is \"practice\"  the first 5 times you do it as you're learning the fingerings and changes, the next 200 times is \"play\" and doesn't count towards the practice hours. The high school bands are too much play, too little practice.\n\nRacking up 1000 hours of practice probably requires 2000 hours of total effort, since it's best to blend practice and play.",

You\u2019re practicing, and learning how forms and lines come together to create an image.\n\nFind an image that\u2019s interesting.  Grid it off, and turn it upside down.  Grid off a blank piece of paper, and try to copy exactly what you see in each square.  Not what your brain is telling you is supposed to be there, but what you actually *see*.

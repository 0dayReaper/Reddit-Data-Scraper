Address the argument not the person, no matter how much you think them a fatuous loathsome antediluvian troglodyte.\n\nIt's a challenge, I know.  Find your happy place.\n\n[Edit]  A lot you are reporting comments because you strongly disagree with their point of view.  That's not how it works.  Again, read the rules, read Reddit's site-wide rules, then pull up your big-boy pants and write a scathing reply that'll surely show them.",

Why are you making life harder for us?  \n\n Now think about how many people watched these activists and decided they'd vote for a party that would end the annoying protest rather than voting for a party that would have action on climate change. \n\nThat's why successful protests need to offer more than disruption to get attention.

            "comment": "\"In one of the key scenes in Alfonso Cuaron's 2006 film Children of Men, Clive Owen's character, Theo, visits a friend at Battersea Power Station, which is now some combination of government building and private collection. Cultural treasures - Michelangelo's David, Picasso's Guernica, Pink Floyd's inflatable\npig - are preserved in a building that is itself a refurbished heritage artifact. This is our only glimpse into the lives of the elite, holed up against the effects of a catastrophe which has caused mass sterility: no children have been born for a generation. Theo asks the question, 'how all this can matter if there will be no-one to see it?' The alibi can no longer be future generations, since there will be none. The response is nihilistic hedonism: 'I try not to think about it'.\" -Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism",

They have directly assisted in forming connections between these companies and politicians/elites to gain more drilling permits, with every admissions payment contributing to these efforts. The Museum of Britain didn\u2019t cut off its connections to BP until last year, after activists like these pressured them following the one of the hottest summers in recorded European history. The world is becoming uninhabitable, wildfires the likes of which have never been seen are breaking out, and animals are dying off in the billions. We are literally all going to die, and people are worried about a glass case getting covered in paint. We\u2019re doomed. These pieces of artwork, every fiber of canvas every drop of paint and acrylic are fucking pointless if there\u2019s no one to look at them. How people don\u2019t get the point of these protests is beyond me.",

But many of these types of protests are less about the cause and more about the activists ego. The mentality is \"I'm right so I can do what I like to express that and fuck everyone else.\" Vegan protestors do the same when they hit the streets yelling at people and calling them murderers and showing graphic imagery. They mentality is \"I'm right.\" Not \"Is what I'm doing effective?\". And they'll do their protest and come back to a community of people patting them on the back. And that feeling is what's being chased. Validation for being right. Being told your so brave and so smart. But it's only other activists (maybe a small fraction of the public) that admire the action. The action isn't for the public. The action is done to impress their fellow activists and get that social reward and it's emboldened by the idea of being right. And you know what, you are right. Activists are right. Climate change is a global issue. All of the things you said about museums and galleries etc is right. And if that's all they care about is being right, then mission successful. But it isn't effective. It turns people off activist groups. It looks egotistical. Art IS important to many people even if it isn't to them. Me personally, i dont give a shit about the art. I dont care if people are late for work. I love the anarchy. Anything thay dusrupts a persons day and breaks them out of their 9 to 5 for a few moments is something i gain alot of satisfaction from. But just because i like it doesnt mean its effective. These actions make activists look silly and immature. People do get the point of these protests. They just don't believe you are expressing yourself well. That's why they cop so much shit and disdain from the public. Not because they are wrong. Because they are expressing themselves unproductively and in a way specifically designed to draw hate because the mentality is \"any publicity is good publicity.\" But that's not true. Bad publicity will only result in people avoiding activism and ignoring it.",

Oil is finite.\n\nWe act like it will last forever. 8 billion on this planet and soon once we run out of oil what then?\n\nWhat will people in power do then?

I'm guessing because art class told us basically what to create, is why I didn't do well there. Also no surprise I failed chemistry.\n\nThat was about 25 years ago. Looking back at all those drawings (saved almost everyone), I just know that creativity inside of me has fallen asleep. Although, I do get to utilize some of it while creating kitchen designs.\n\nMy advice to you is just get a sketch book &amp; pencil/pen; start scribbling while hanging on the couch with the tv on.",

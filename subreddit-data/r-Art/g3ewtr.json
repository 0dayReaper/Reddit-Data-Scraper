In my interpretation, it just feels so much like nostalgia in its peak idealized form, and the organized chaos really adds to that memory recall type feel.

Notice that all the best memories are the ones where you're most mindful and in the moment - I find that when I work on that, you get the best kind of experiences happening again. \n\nMy friends were lamenting how much fun Minecraft was when we first played it, but it was just that we dove in with no expectations and were in the moment back then.\n\n The other day I booted it up with a friend and we didn't try to recreate any memories or set any expectations, we didn't even expect to play it that day - and we both had the time of our lives messing around. It's a memory honestly better than back in the \"good times\" we'd nostalgically remembered before. I think it's because we were totally in the moment letting it happen.",

Back in 2000 when I was in 8th grade,\nand because I was stupid, ate a bowl of deer chili prior to a football game.\n\n I played every single down except kickoff  that game and after the opposing team scored and both teams ran off the field to prepare for a kickoff, I was the only one who remained because I was to nauseous to run. I stood there at about the 30 yard line halfway to our sideline and in front of my team, God, the cheerleaders and the entire town in the stands, I projectile vomited with a force nobody ever thought possible. I could hear the entire crowd go \u201coohh...OHH!!\u201d, as my second salvo of super human projectile deer chili vomit launched 10 yards in front of me.\n\n I shamefully washed my face mask off, drank a bunch of water and kept playing.",

It was all a great mystery.   But the entire ride you bikes to your friends before hand.... Can't wait for parents to go to bed finally...  And there it was... The glow, the game, and the victories &amp; defeats.... And a long tired day following.  :)",

Every time you changed the channel, *\u201dka-chunk! ka-chunk! ka-chunk!\u201d*, just like the gyrocaptain, and shit.\n\nThe remotes looked like a fat pack of smokes, with three buttons sticking out about an inch. They went down and ended with a satisfying *\u201dchock!\u201d* before pushing themselves up again. That sound operated the channel circuit in the TV. \n\nBefore those remotes, there was a multi-piece system using a remote box, with a dial on it, that you turned to change channels. A hollow cable sheath with a spinning, flexible steel cable inside led to another box that attached onto the channel dial on the TV set. \n\nThe cable worked by you spinning the remote dial, which spun the cable (with square ends, like a speedometer cable, or a plumbing snake), and the cable would turn the mechanism inside the box attached to the set, which would then *physically operate* the set\u2019s channel dial. No electronics involved at all, just a spinning thing that seemed to weigh about ten pounds and you could trip over or even stub a toe on. They also made even more noise than the pack of smokes remote at grandma\u2019s house.\n\nAlso, the larger, heavier TV sets would sit on the floor, so your sister and the dog were constantly blocking your view or at least fidgeting In front of you. That always sucked.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of how I used to be forced to watch those crappy, ancient TVs that old people had when I was a kid. We really do already live in a futuristic wonder-world, people, trust me. \n\nHave a good night, folks - and be good to each other, too.",

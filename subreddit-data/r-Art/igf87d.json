Do not wait AT ALL or you will get caught in the massive group of people tilting the purple see saw all the way to the left or right and not knowing collectively how to fix it. Also, never jump from see saw to see saw unless you have to. If the next one is lower, just drop onto it to prevent falling. But I cant stress enough, you're first chance is your best chance. Book it right out of the gate. Sorry for the rant, I love the game haha",

I always liked how they didn't shy away from making Chun-li so toned and muscular. \n\nI enjoyed Serenity, but it's like, she's so skinny, she wouldn't have the power to do those moves. The Wonder Woman thing I can pass off as her being magical, but I prefer the bigger, bulkier comics / animated versions versus Gal Gadot. \n\nShe may be a hot mess personally, but I was glad they had Gina Carano in Mandalorian as well. \n\nedit: Oh yeah, also, I don't watch it that much myself, but I will see professional wrestling posts on r/all. There seems to be much higher quantity and quality of female wrestlers; actual athletes and not just pretty girls in bikinis squirming against each other, as I remember seeing in my younger days. \n\nGet some variety in women's representation. All sorts of sizes and builds are attractive. Live the life that makes you happy.\n\nGlad you didn't let those detractors keep you from your shine.",

First of all, it\u2019s not about what guys like it\u2019s about what they like for their own body. Second of all, muscles on women are hot as fuck.",

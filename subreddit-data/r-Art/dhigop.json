The reason we both (and surely many - if not most - designers) fell into this trap is because there's way less demand for art then there are artists in our glorious economy-based society, as pictured on this thread's painting... \n\nSo we ended up in the \"next best thing\" that still puts food on our tables and turns out it sucks - as most careers, unfortunately.

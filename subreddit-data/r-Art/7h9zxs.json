My favorite part of his show is that at some point in an actual instant a bunch of smears of oil goes from an abstract painting to a realistic one. I have never painted, but his show teaches that in his style of oil painting the texture and height of how the oil sits on the canvas (like height off the canvas towards the viewer) can create that \u201coh shit Bobby wtf just happened boio\u201d moments.

Because trust me... abstract is more than just kid doodles. You can pretend to make art... and then you can make art. The difference is how it speaks to us. And a definition of good art is not defined by the artist. Its defined by the culture that accepts it. The mona Lisa wasn\u2019t famous until it was stolen. Van gogh died a nobody until his family told the world his story. Its all about how it connects to us. ",

I know hanging out, watching movies/tv, and trying to get laid are admirable endeavors, but you don\u2019t end up with anything tangible, except maybe a knowledge of what marvel movies are the good ones. Talent is a something that is worked for while everyone else is busy doing something fun. You hear an artist make a nice song and think they\u2019re talented, but you don\u2019t hear the hours and hours of mistakes and noodling that got them to that point. They were alone in their room ignoring texts from their buddies to come chill because they *wanted* to be talented at something. Whenever someone wonders why they\u2019re not talented, I propose that it\u2019s because they never really wanted to be.",

I recall reading (though I may be mistaken) that even Leonardo Davinci was talking about this in one of his journals.\n\nHe used to love to do all types of creative mind excessive to stimulate his senses and inspire creativity. He also used to sit at the riverbanks and close his eyes and listen to everything as far as he could hear. Then he would use his mind to isolate out each sound he heard. Someone fishing, little kid playing by the river, the churning of the water, sound of a boat, etc. Then he would get lost in the sound thinking about it creatively (like mini stories or ideas). Davinci had such a creative passion for life.",

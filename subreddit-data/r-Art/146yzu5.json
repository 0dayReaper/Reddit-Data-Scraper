Because mental illness wasn't really understood back then he probably didn't have schizophrenia and more than likely had autism. \n\n\"Although Wain made more abstract paintings in his later years, there is no confirmation that he had schizophrenia as most of his paintings do not have dates on them, it is no definitive showcase of Schizophrenia and has been argued he more likely had Autism Spectrum Disorder\"\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/irish-journal-of-psychological-medicine/article/louis-wain-and-aspergers-syndrome/0920A68EED969B70A852AC240A4300EC",

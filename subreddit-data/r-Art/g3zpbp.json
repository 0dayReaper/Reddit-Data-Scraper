I am sure if I still had young kids I'd still have (whatever the current Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network shows are) on. \n\nI think you should take a weekend and explore some of those shows. They aren't *wonderful* but they made me smile. \n\nI did go back and watch some Ren and Stimpy, boy do I get why my mom hated it (I still love it). Highly recommend \"don't whiz on the electric fence\" episode/segment.",

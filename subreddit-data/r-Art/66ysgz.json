Completely freehand, very little to no underdrawing, painting on fired ceramic that soaks up water and glaze like a sponge, no practical way to erase or fix mistakes. Those brushes look handmade, too, wouldn't be surprised if the artist made them.\n\nWhatever it costs, it's absolutely worth it.",

You see it in establishment art, architecture, music, and more. You also see lots of counter examples, but these movements tend to be deliberate subversions of this theme. It's hard to escape your cultural context, but from an outside perspective, Western culture is aesthetically pretty preoccupied with stately, dignified, even geometric, balanced ideal forms and ratios. It's a cultural value we all take for granted without even thinking of much, that informs a lot of our creative output (whether we're channelling it, or subverting it).",

It's actually kind of interesting because being that it was known as a symbol of peace, a dictator using it pretty much sets up a story of \"spreading peace\" or at least what he assumes is peace.",

Symbols have a long history, and Hitler appropriated a very positive symbol to use on the flag for his horrible campaign. In the western world, he effectively corrupted and ruined the symbol's original message of peace and good luck (I'm simplifying things somewhat, but essentially it was a symbol with very positive connotations). Many parts of Asia were never directly affected by the Nazis, and therefore the symbol's reputation was never ruined there. In fact, during World War I many European soldiers actually carried little metal versions of this symbol as good luck charms. It appeared on greeting cards, and was very popular for a time. \n\nAnd this is why it's so upsetting that people are assuming that this guy is painting Nazi propaganda onto a bowl. Because it shows that even though Hitler didn't win the war, he still won the symbol (in Europe at least). And that's unfair, because the original symbol has really positive meanings and doesn't deserve the terrible reputation it has gotten. By associating it with Hitler, we're just doing what he wanted us to do. It's about time we stopped thinking of it in a negative light and returned to the symbol in its original context. ",

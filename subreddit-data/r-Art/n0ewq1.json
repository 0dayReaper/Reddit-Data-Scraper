I'm not counting elementary, middle, and Highschool art classes where the teachers have said Ok, \"Here's your assignment! Now have at it\". I have always just drawn what I see. Learning to draw is learning to \"see\" the detail, in my opinion. There are many ways you can replicate that detail. Some want to shade. Some want to do \"stipling\"; but it's a matter of seeing what is there and if you wish, translating what your eyes see on paper in your own style, or going after hyper-realism (that's what I do). There is *very* little going on mechanically in the fingers - it is how your brain interprets what is there and if you see fine detail, there is nothing to be \"taught\".\n\n\nAgain, this is just my opinion. I have tried to teach others to draw and it comes down to them not observing the texture, for example. They draw it smooth, where it may be something like hair. Hair has flyaways, shine on the scalp and the body of the hair, depending on the light source. I will point it out to them and they will draw it again.. But it may be going a different direction, and I say, follow the lines, where do they go.. I believe it is a matter of noticing things in the first place and improving with practice, which improves your ability to \"see\" what is actually there.",

If someone can write an alphabet they have all the hand skill to make any mark they need. But our brains aren\u2019t trained to see what is there. They are trained to filter information and thus process images more as symbols than the actual visual object itself. Thus, the primary lesson in art is simply learning to see.\n\nOne great test I like is to have someone try to copy an image. Not a trace, but try and copy. Then, after the first attempt, have them turn the same image upside down and copy that. It\u2019s amazing how much easier it is and it\u2019s because we \u201ctrick\u201d our brain into being confused and thus can actually see the image as an image.\n\nOf course there\u2019s loads of techniques you can learn, equipment to experiment with, and lots of theory to explore. But at heart, yep - it\u2019s learning to see.\n\nSide note, practicing \u201cseeing\u201d for a while and then going outside is a truly wondrous experience. I\u2019ve never seen colors so vibrant or movement so clear. Well, maybe outside of psychedelic experiences.",

I struggle with it all. I don't know how hard to press - or even what to use half the time. Drawing is a skill with a lot of depth and knowledge behind it outside of just seeing something.\n\nIt's like a circle. Can the human hand draw a decent circle? Yeah. But I can't just sit and draw a good circle. I don't know the movements, the \"feel\", I struggle with knowing when to curve, how much to curve, etc etc.\n\nIdk, just my perspective as someone who has tried to draw, who lives with a talented artist.",

The type of art I want to show to more people so they can possibly experience this feeling.\n\nJust wow honestly.\n\nEDIT: since I keep seeing the same assumptions made: This is not the first time nor the most extreme I have sympathized for this topic, I don't think women are the only ones who face this, and the definition of empathy I tend to use(also the Oxford Dictionary):\n\n \"The ability to understand and share the feelings of another. \"\n\nIf you cannot link brains you cannot truly empathize, only deeply sympathize.  If you do not think this is a functional definition that is fine, but understand this is why I expressed it the way I did.  This made me feel a strong sympathy and I think that is powerful for art.",

What helps me is identifying what feeling I get physically, tying it to an emotion, then finding the reason why I got that emotion by asking myself questions. \n\nFirst, emotions come with physical feeling. As in, you'll feel a tightness in your chest, a heaviness in your stomach, a lightness in your head, a hot face, or your heart feels like it's pumping out of your chest, or you have a hard time inhaling and exhaling completely. All of these are related to specific emotions, such as tightness in the chest is related to anxiety, or a pit in your stomach is related to regret or reluctance. First identify what you're physically feeling and focus on it. You might be feeling more than one thing, but it helps to focus on one first. \n\nSecond, try to identify what that specific physical feeling means to you and if it's pleasant or unpleasant. Not everyone is the same, and some physical feelings are only very subtly different from each other, or they come in pairs. \"What does this emotion make me want to do?\" is a good question to answer that could tell you what emotion you feel. For example, an unpleasant warm face that makes you want to leave a social situation could mean embarrassment, while a warm face that makes you want to kiss someone might mean attraction or sheepishness. \n\nFinally, after identifying the emotion, ask yourself \"Why do I feel this?\" and ask yourself questions. \"Do I feel (emotion) because (situation)?\"\n For example, \"Do I feel (frustrated) because (my boss was rude)?\". For me, when I find the answer to my question, I feel a tiny bit of relief, which lets me know I found the correct answer. Then, become more specific by asking who, what, and why. And really allow yourself to answer the questions sincerely, no matter how petty or unflattering the answers might be. At the end of the day, you're the only one who knows the answers. \n\nAlso, avoid chalking everything up to anger or frustration, since dissatisfied emotions become these two very easily. It's common to find other more complex and intertwined emotions under anger and frustration.",

Excited/Victorious\n\n2. Angry\n\n...and that's kinda it.\n\nIt gets to the point where a lot of men might be upset about something but lack the vocabulary to even begin to describe what they're feeling, much less what to do about it.\n\nWhat do you mean you feel \"bad\"? Are you frustrated? Anxious? Embarrassed? Sad? Guilty? Jealous? Scared? \n\nIf you find yourself answering questions like that with \"I don't know\" or \"I don't want to talk about it\" then that's being out of touch with your emotions.\n\nThink about a baby; babies are out of touch with their *physical* sensations, because they haven't had much chance to practice being alive. A baby doesn't know what \"Hungry\" or \"Gassy\" or \"Tired\" feel like. They also don't know that Eating, Burping, or Sleeping respectively will solve those problems. They just know they feel \"Bad\" and start crying until their parent comes over and begins trying to guess what might be wrong. Its a process of trial and error for the parent to diagnose the problem, and many months of frustration for both parties until the baby begins to learn the associations between specific feelings, the problems that cause those feelings, and the solutions that fix them.\n\nMen often find themselves similarly unable to diagnose emotional problems because of a similar lack of experience. This then frequently leads the women in their lives--their mothers when they're young and their wives when they're older--to go through that arduous process of trial and error to figure out what's wrong and what to do about it. \n\nAnd all because our society has deemed it  \"weak\" or \"effeminate\" or \"gay\" to be in touch with your own emotions.\n\nIf you're looking for  good (fictional) role models, look closely at the men in The Lord of the Rings. They grieve and cry together. They tell each other how much they care. They admit when they were lost in despair, to get help from those who hadn't lost hope yet. And through all of this, their empathy and connection makes them seem *more* noble and heroic, not less. Sam's boundless optimism and selfless love for Frodo is essential to keep him going. Aragorn is a noble and kingly man specifically because he is a healer and a councilor and knows how to encourage those who lost hope. Gandalf is constantly reminding those around him about simple, small acts of courage and kindness that can change the whole course of the future, somehow exactly when they need to hear it the most.\n\nThe goal is to be more like that, aware of what you're feeling, why, and the feelings and motivations of your friends and family. To be in touch with those feelings, rather than feeling like you're either \"numb/neutral\" or \"out of control\". And to use your full range of emotions as a natural extension of yourself, rather than having it just happen to you.",

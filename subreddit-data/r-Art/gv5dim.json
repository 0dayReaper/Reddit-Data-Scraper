Instead of treating adult problems the same way a child treats a scratch on the knee - deal with it and move on - adulthood problems make you feel unheard, invisible or as if you don't matter.\n\nAgain, not every problem is a childhood problem. \n\nHowever, a lot of times, a superficially happy and safe childhood is not always an indicator of an ideal growth environment.

Its crazy, I thought I was different and got out and into my adult life as a nearing-complete person with no baggage except minor bullying baggage (like everybody else). Boy was I wrong, Ive never been more distraught and lost in my life. \n\nBut anyway. Hang in there peeps, and get help. Working through issues can be fun and so with a knowledgeable professional.",

That\u2019s called being unempathetic.\n\nwell, no offense but fuck you. ;-)\n\ni'm one of these people, and i'd like to say i turned out fine. and again, in my experience the people who had a good upbringing repeat that with their children, while people from ghetto-like asocial shitholes tend to have children that turn out to be little fuckers, bullies and sociopaths.\n\nwhere does your experience / opinion come from? your own experience as well? shitty childhood, but you're good? i'm genuinely curious.",

And yeh exactly, what you said. \n\nI mean....the term basically means \u201cthe after effects of a traumatic event\u201d obviously. Whether that\u2019s sure, a war veteran having seen horrific things. Or a person seeing their beloved dog run over and killed. All these things are traumatic. Kind of a ridiculous example, but even stubbing your toe on something leaves an incredibly mild trauma......anything that hurts us, is going to leave us with anxieties after. \n\nSo yeah definitely no shame. I feel people deserve to make sense of, and make peace with whatever traumas they\u2019ve experienced, however mild and however severe. \n\nEveryone benefits. The person suffering from the trauma, and everyone they come into contact with",

ACES aware is trying to push for screening of ACES and for them to be valued as risk factors for a lot of harmful life outcomes.

I thought half the world had committed suicide because of a subliminal message and that the rest of us were ascending to the next level of reality as angels. I did some absurd things because I was so absolutely sure of the divinity I saw in everything. That's not even half of it. It just goes on and on how crazy I got.\n\nI was in control the whole time though. That's what scared me the most. It wasn't that I lost control or consciousness , though I did at times, it was that my thoughts got so twisted my actions made sense. So I became terrified of my thoughts getting out of control and developed some ocd. I have some hang ups from childhood for sure but I can't imagine the book going over my issue with the fear of snapping one day. I've overcome most of that by now anyway.",

And the sooner we accept that sadness is part of it, the easier we can confront it and the less invasive it becomes.  First step is become aware of your feelings, then find the source of those feelings (why?), then really..you just gotta feel them.  Allow yourself to feel sad.  Sadness is ok.  Give yourself a hug and let yourself cry.  Yes, there are actions you can take to resolve some of the root issues (like not feeling loved, or worthy or safe...), such as investing in your habits and relationships and letting go of negative self talk, but the only way is through.  And the more we allow ourselves to feel, the sooner those feelings pass.  So to answer \"how to stop feeling sad\", really...you just need to let yourself feel sad.",

I'm sure I'll get flack for this, but hear me out, I don't think masculinity is a bad thing- but the stigma that a man is 'less emotional' or 'men don't cry' - emotions don't actually go away no matter how well you've trained yourself to (big air quotes) \"hide the hurt\", it will come out in other ways sadness turning into anger, and because you've gone so long believing it's wrong of you to cry and talk about what you're going through, your emotions become unreadable to yourself, a deeper problem, burred deep. And I believe it starts with expectations, how we treat our men when they're young.   \n\n\nThis is a beautiful piece, I'm following you and saving this one!

I'm reading an interview right now in it with a guy who was a white supremacist and had one of the most violent records in the prison he was kept in. \n\nI'm reading this intro to him like \"how on earth can someone end up like that?\" and then it goes on to say growing up he never had a bed, always had to sleep on the floor, and would not be allowed to go to the bathroom until he soiled himself, and then would get beaten after soiling himself. He ran away at 11 and was taken in by a gang, which was the first thing that ever showed him anything like attention or care. In the gang he was taught to use violence first to show others they can't dominate you. \n\nAnd then I was just like \"oh, that's how someone becomes like that.\"\n\nThankfully he is now reformed, and has a rehab group called Life After Hate. But this picture really made me think of this guy and this book in general.",

BE A MAN. For years I bottled it up, \u201cstayed strong\u201d and never let anyone know what I was thinking. I solved relationship problems by shouting them away. I refused to address underlying mental worries and replaced them with black/white answers to my problems that I thought quickly solved everything. When any boy at school showed any compassion or signs of being upset they were quickly labelled a \u201cfaggot\u201d or a \u201cbig girl\u201d. Some kid in my English class got bullied to shit because he cried in class the day after his dog was run over. Imagine that. \n\nThis kind of stuff sinks in to the young, subconscious and malleable mind of a teenage boy. And trust me, it stays there. I didn\u2019t even cry when my Nanna died because I thought I\u2019d be seen as \u201cweak\u201d or not in \u201ccontrol\u201d of my emotions, especially around friends. I repressed my emotions so much that crying, at that time, literally wasn\u2019t an option for me both physically and mentally. It became impossible to do so. It did me no favours whatsoever. \n\nMy significant other has taught me it\u2019s ok for men to cry, express regret or sorrow, admit to worrying about stuff, admit to feeling helpless and in turn asking for help. I\u2019m a much happier guy now although so much repression leaves hangover stuff, particularly when it comes to anger. \n\nBecause that\u2019s what happens. I know first hand. You bottle all this stuff up and it releases itself as anger on a biblical scale. Being a man isn\u2019t about any of the macho bullshit we\u2019re still fed in certain areas of the media; muscles, carefree attitude, defensive and \u201calpha\u201d. It\u2019s about being a good person, a caring and compassionate companion, being reliable and understanding of others needs, being a friend and a good role model to those younger or less fortunate than you and being willing to address your own emotions in a meaningful way.",

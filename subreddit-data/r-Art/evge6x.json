The servers are glancing at you from the server station, complaining to one another about this buffoon who has dumped a bunch of salt on the table and is now playing with it. They pity you, so they don't say anything. Your server refills your water several times, but when they realize you won't be ordering anything they stop coming over. \n\nYou are forgotten: by the restaurant, the person you're waiting for, and maybe even yourself. Eventually you stand, put on your coat, and walk out, feeling too pathetic to even consider yourself dejected. \n\nYour server, standing in the kitchen--staring at the dreamy new dishwasher who has no idea how beautiful they are--suddenly remembers that they haven't checked up on you for a while. They walk out of the swinging kitchen door with a fresh, ice cold pitcher of water to fill your cup. They see you aren't there anymore and purse their lips toward their cheek, an almost unconscious emotional tick of sadness that they weren't able to make your presumably shitty day any better. But they roll their eyes and grab a towel to come remove your water cup and wipe up the mound of salt you had been playing with. \n\nWhen the server gets to the table, their face brightens from the sight of the beautiful and strange salt shark you left. As they wipe it up they chuckle to themself thinking, \"Now it's a salt *water* shark.\" You never return to that Outback again, though your server hopes you do so they can tell you how beautiful they thought your shark was. \n\nYou snapped a picture and thought that Reddit might appreciate your creation. The people in your life often let you down, but Reddit is always there. Reddit always brightens your day. The reception far surpasses anything that you would have expected. But you will never know the joy you brought to your server at Outback Steakhouse. \n\nI've never done this but I just felt randomly inspired to write a short little imagined backstory to this post. It's fun to imagine. I often forget that in my adulthood.",

            "comment": "A truly moving commentary on the ephemerality of life and death. The artist's chosen media - salt and wood - sets up a thoughtful juxtaposition of the deep sea, unknowable and unnerving, with the familiarity-verging-on-banality of cut, planed and varnished wood.  The piece asks us to consider our fears, and examine the structures of value and mortality beneath them, as the grain of the table shows through the very flesh of the shark.  Doing so, we may see that we live in a world where even the very real and visceral fear of prey succumbing to a predator feels unimportant; and if death is no more tangible to us than a pile of salt, what is there to fix life in place for us?",

                    "comment": "The ephemeral nature of this piece reminds us also of the fleeting replacements for such meaningful ideas as mortality and value. These noble and lofty concepts are, in our modern age, subsumed by materialism and a desperate lust for dominance over each other. Like a bucket of crabs, with fancy hats. For what beyond humans, could be a greater mortal threat? As a great warrior poet once said, \"What if God stays in heaven, for He too lives in fear of what He has created?\"",

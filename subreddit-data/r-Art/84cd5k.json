The wheelchair is important because he grew very connected to it. By now we've had much more sophisticated speech synthesis, for instance, but the heavily electronic speech had become his voice and he wasn't willing to part with it. That brings me to my final observation which is that his chair wasn't a burden tying him down- it was an extension of his self which allowed him to express his mind and explore the world. What you've painted makes it seem like the chair was his burden. If there's one message that he'd want to share with other disabled people I'd imagine that it would be that the chair is not a burden at all.",

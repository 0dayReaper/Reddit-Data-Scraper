And as u/EvilCycle said they set the scale for the piece as well.\n\nNow take a look at the rest of the piece. There is far more negative space used than you realise. And what space that has been used, has been detailed with simple ( not a stab at the method or style! Just a simplistic explanation ) overlapping lines.\n\nThough those knuckles would've eaten up some time, the detailing of the fur has been done very smartly. Basically in this case the artist \"Worked smart, not hard\" but that doesn't mean that it wasn't hard work to produce this result. \n\nI know that *I* couldn't produce something this beautiful.",

The fur on the head to up most the time and the fur on the arms didnt take up much time to do.\n\n I think the main thing people are unaware of is that black paper takes half the time to draw black fur. All I hear to do was draw the highlights and the paper does the shadows for me. If I had done this on white paper with graphite or charcoal it would have taken much much longer. That's the main reason I usually op towards using black paper because of how much time I can save since I only draw in my spare time in the weekends and would loose motivation if I had to spend 40 plus hours on one imagine throughout a couple weeks",

It\u2019s knowing that you could face anything physical and not be afraid or daunted but this thing this tiny mass of cells that was killing my mother was something that I could never reach inside of her and take out. I felt small I felt so insignificant and powerless and scared. Sometimes no matter how powerful you feel you are there will always be something out of your control and that feeling is humbling.",

Im cool with being affected by art, but like its always damn near a cult like mindset.

Also, it's in a style that I have read before that is sometimes hard for me to digest because it is a conversation but the antagonist sometimes asks basic or dumb questions just so the protagonist can make a point that I think is not necessarily solid. That being said. I fully endorse reading it just for the self reflection.",

I probably will, eventually, but I don\u2019t feel the need to read it like a bible, and I didn\u2019t find it too preachy. In my memory at least, it\u2019s less a book that tells you how to think/feel and more a book the reveals new perspectives, information, and lines of thought for you to consider. I do think it\u2019s a very impactful piece of brain food that everybody with any leanings towards historical or philosophical curiosity should experience at least once. It\u2019s also extremely well written, and even my impatient high school self was completely sucked in. Don\u2019t let the over enthusiasm of others ruin something good. I didn\u2019t play dnd until I was thirty one for pretty much the same reason...what ever was I thinking?!",

I'm an artist myself, so I can fully see what you've done; what I want to say *why* this is so good, because things like this are so rare.  Many artists believe that all it takes is technical artistic skill, but it's much more than that.  Storytellers in art are rare, those who can engage you beyond just mere ability or craft are not easily found.\n\nThis drawing of yours tells a compelling story through skill and subject matter, and the story is continued through the very title, and then it is completed in the mind of the observer.  This is synergy.  The work is wonderfully complete and whole, which many artists seem to forget about going after these days.  We want the *entire* package, which is the full story and the completion of the artist-observer covenant, which you've done here perfectly.  That, my friend, is power.",

It isn't quite the same I'd seen of him, but just a reminder for me of his vulnerability and my own as he stared at me. It was a very emotional experience for me. Thanks for the lovely picture and memory.",

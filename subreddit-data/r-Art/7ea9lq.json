Like if I swing a ball in a circle, it might feel like the ball is being pushed away from the centre, but in actuality it wants to go in a straight line and I am forcing it to curve into the circle. In fact if I let go, it will fly off at a straight line at a tangent to the circle, because I won't be accelerating it into a curve anymore",

If it was a 360\u00b0 spherical camera (or large fisheye) then it might be more appropriate to say stereographic (even though there is a cartesian step in there) while stitching together a panorama of rectangular images might better be called a polar transform. \n\nThe end result is the same.

When normal people see someone in a familiar situation it can trigger mirror neurons to fire in their brains, allowing them to actually feel (on a lesser level) the emotions of the other person. \n\nFor psychopaths and some others, they have to make an effort to feel empathy. But plenty of non-psychopathic people have low empathy.\n\n",

I keep telling myself one day I will binge watch the whole thing and finally, finish it.\n  \nStill haven't done so.

A bag has to be within every small tolerance of the target weight or it's a labeling violation. That's not to say there haven't been packaging changes over the years to make bags \"look bigger\", but a 13 ounce bag will always have 13 ounces of chips in it regardless of how much air is / isn't in the bag.

It spoke to me from the idea of isolation and the removed-ness; a young, healthy girl in a setting more appropriate for the sick and elderly, an experience she is absorbing through her computer; without actually being there, eating a potato product that claims to have a meat-related flavor.\n\nProbably she dreamed of this moment this week, even tweeted about how she is looking forward to it because something something I'm socially awkward and this is heaven to me. And tomorrow she'll talk about \"what a great weekend\" she had, and the other party will respond back saying they are like that too, and they \"don't have time for people drama\" and all that.\n\n\nIt's a very strong piece because we all know this person, if we are not that person and it captures that familiar feeling of isolation extremely well. Great job indeed. ",

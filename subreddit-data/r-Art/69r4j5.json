There are these super bright lights in it but there's nothing that's casting the reflection, they're just randomly there. The lights would need to be brighter than the reflection too so they couldn't be the lights in the city. Still a cool painting but something that bugged me.",

If you get very very close on a high res photo you can see that there are very very few cracks and that the color is rich and very well preserved.

Regular screen 2:  documentation, stack overflow (*), architecture diagrams, whatever it is that isn't code, that directly helps you code.  Small screen:  Outlook, chat system, browser window with Pandora and spare tabs from break/lunch distractions.  That third screen really helps isolate the things that aren't code or directly helping you code, but are necessary anyway.  Sure they can just fall to the back layers if you don't have the third monitor, but there's a lot less thought and window thrash if you can just give them their own screen.  \n\n(*) Learning all of the core programming concepts is necessary, useful, and the only way you'll land a job.  But learning to Google for solutions to problems will make you indispensable once you get there.  If you don't already do this, learn and practice this cycle:  \n1.  Have a problem.  \n2.  Think about the keywords that describe the problem so that it's different from the rest of the problems out there (usually something like \"software/language name (maybe library/module) (maybe version) (maybe OS) [copy/paste of part of error text | failed/crashed/terminated/died]\").  \n3.  Put those keywords into Google and search.  \n4.  Read some of the results page snippets and maybe full pages to see if you're getting what you need.  Try out solutions that seem plausible.  \n5.  If you don't have a working solution yet, check the snippets and full pages for terminology that seems more closely related to the answer you're looking for (maybe you got it wrong the first time, maybe the internet just calls it something different).  \n6.  Swap words out in your Google search and loop from step 4.  You might have to repeat this process a few times, repeatedly swapping in words that seem more closely correlated to the results you're looking for.  \n\nI am amazed at how much better I am at Googling than many other programmers.  \n    coworker:  I'm having this problem.\n    me:  Did you Google it?\n    coworker:  Yes, and I tried X, Y, and Z, none of it worked.\n    me:  [spends 4 minutes Googling] Have you tried this?\n    coworker:  No I haven't, let me try it [tries solution].  It works!  How did you find this?\n    me:  I Googled?",

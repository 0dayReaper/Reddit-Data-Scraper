    "postText": "This creature lives in the Void-Sea. A massive body of water in the limitless void region.  Given that the realm is near-impossible to access, those lucky few who\u2019ve made it to the Void, and then Void-Sea, might get the chance to meet this dragon up close. \n\nMuch of this creature is shrouded in mystery. It has only thrice been seen by a team of research druids from the Grey Clan, and only once by a lone explorer, who\u2019s journal entry gave little details. Those who\u2019ve seen it describe it as a dragon or as one put it \u201cA dragon-beast appearance.\u201d More studies will be needed to give it an official title.\n\nWhat is known, however, is that it uses its bioluminescence in erratic patterns, pulsating along its body and it\u2019s sail-like fins. The lights flash slowly and then pick up speed\u2026then stop altogether, making the beast appear almost completely black. The antennae twist in slow-delicate motions suggesting that they might its primary source of attracting prey\u2026\n\nIt was never seen for any significant length of time. It was never observed eating, or sleeping, or roaming any habitat other than the rocky spires of the Sea\u2019s north-side. Researches said It appeared to to detect their presence almost from the point of encounter. No matter how many spells they used to conceal their presence, it would always flee when approached. \n\n\u201cWe spent 6 days tailing the creature. In that time, we were not able to deduce any of its habits other than its use of agility and light display. It uttered a sound much like a hum which shook us all to the core. It fled for the last time on our final day of the expedition. I should like to study it more.\u201d - Lead Researcher of the Grey Druids\n\n\u201dIt lit the spires with a burning violet and green. I sat there, under a rock, mesmerized but the site of it. Its tendrils danced, ceaselessly and with purpose. Hunting? Mating? I cannot know. I just know I cannot take my eyes off it.\u201d -Journal entry found on the corpse of an adventurer.",

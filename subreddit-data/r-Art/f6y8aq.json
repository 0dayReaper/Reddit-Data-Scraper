I feel like there are too many unique types of details that come into play while piecing together the puzzle that I dont believe someone could very realistically have a second \"brand new\" experience with the game. The best I've gotten was after not touching it for a year being or so, becoming the Navi for my friend who was first time playing. I got to enjoy all of his processes, emotions, and reactions to what was happening as well as smooth out a bit of the adventure by giving slight nudges in certain directions or assist with how the game controls. These nudges were often done in the form of seemingly innocent questions, attempting to allow for as much true player discovery as possible. This might not work for everyone, but he said that he very much enjoyed having someone else there if for no other reason then to basically just be a sounding board lol.",

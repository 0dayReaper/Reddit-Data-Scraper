But consciousness comes with a lot of questionning and sometimes pain.\n\nAs I painted this piece, I couldn't help but feel a sense of connection to the billions of people who grapple with the questions and mysteries of the human mind.\n\nTechnical DETAILS :\n\n130 x 97 cm ;\n\nAcrylic paint marker, oil based sanguine pencil, oil on stretched linen canvas ;\n\n2023. Signed, titled, dated in the back",

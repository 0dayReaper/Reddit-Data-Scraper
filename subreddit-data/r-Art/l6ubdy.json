If only ignorance of the mechanics came into play, I could see this as at least interesting without being emotionally invested. Yet Robinhood has handicapped one side. Services are disrupted (though moreso yesterday than today). These events are upsetting. There is no amusement in this type of action. Wall street is now making it difficult for retailers to take action after having made their decision, whether to their benefit or not. This goes beyond taking advantage of emotional momentum and ignorance. I viewed wall street with interest to an extent. Now I only feel disgust, anger, and sadness. Those that condone or participate in these restrictions are pathetic.",

(so the hedge funds could buy back later at serious profit) instead... of things going to their plans, the internet stepped in and they grabbed a ton of shares and bought them all up quickly.\n\nThe available supply of shares is not enough out there to cover what the hedge funds \"borrowed\" from others, and so in order to obtain a share to give back they are having to bleed money.  They now owe not only the cost of the share borrowed (but also the difference in price).\n\nMeanwhile Redditors in WallStreetBets are encouraging people to hold the stock and keep locking them out until the 29th. (unsure if longer) Im not sure on the details there but its interesting to see them shiv the hedge funds in such a glorious fashion.\n\nMeanwhile CNN and other newsites are doing the bidding of their corporate overlords and painting the subreddit as moronic internet users who have no idea what they are doing. In reality there was a considerable amount of effort done to notice the underhanded behavior of the hedge funds, predict their future moves, and then rally as a unified buying force to stop their plot from working.\n\nEdit: Want a better explanation:[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/)",

Yea they have to return the shares at some point in time, but there is no defined end date they have to return them by.  They are paying interest for every day they borrow the shares.  what appears to be happening is that most of the people who borrowed shares in the beginning have lost a lot of money and EXITED their position, meaning they said \u201cI\u2019m out, you win.\u201d Despite this, there is still a very high number of shorts out there.  How? Because they have come in at these extreme prices, 200,300,400,500 dollars.  These are the new shorts we are likely dealing with.  They have seen the risk of the last few weeks, and think they can weather the storm. If you think you/we can beat them, then by all means keep holding. But this is a gamble and not a certainty.",

Why not blast the machine responsible for keeping wages low and corporate profits high? 10k at 2% increase each year will not even be a usable nest egg at the rate things are going, and the fed printing money will cause the dollar to drop in value, making that 10k even less valuable going into the future.\n\n\nI might be wrong on some of these points or maybe just of the mark.

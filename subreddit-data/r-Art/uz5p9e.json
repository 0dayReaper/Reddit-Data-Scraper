One of whom was nearly killed but luckily just grazed his head. Reports have come out that the police department told the border patrol agents to wait until backup. But these brave agents went and killed the shooter\n\nAlso, A representative for the Police station said that police officers went into the school to grab their own children. \n\nAnd that during 40 minutes, there was no response by the police as the policy of every single police station is to enter and stop the situation immediately. Also, there was a report of a young girl calling the police over the span of said 40 minutes 5 times to get the police to come. During that time, the shooter shot in classroom multiple times. \n\nAnd that at a point, 19 officers were inside the school but choose not to approach and kill the shooter because as they said they needed more officers so that it would be safer. Source : Inside Edition has a video of said proof. \n\n\nEdit: The budget went to the entire police department",

I've been pulled over about 10 other times for non moving violations and they were all pleasant experiences that led to me just getting a warning to fix my headlight or mount my front plate.

Didn't think it happened 1in my small liberal leaning town. I was working at a gas station and sold a pack of cigarettes to a black 18 year old kid. Right across the street was an upscale Chevy dealership and it was right around the re-release of the modern Camaro. Every day we would talk about all the new Corvettes and Camaros and he'd joke about how he's gonna buy one soon even though we were both broke as fuck and nobody was gonna loan either of us 40k for a Camaro. \n\nSo he walks out the door and walks along the side of the highway where the dealership was like he always does and started taking pictures of the cameras. Cop rolls by, tells him he can't be there. He's like \"ok sir sorry, im just walking my house is right over there.\" Cop tells him not to give him any lip and gestures over to the parking lot and asks him for ID. Right in front of my window the cop slams him against the hood of his car and tells him to shut the fuck up anytime he says anything. This kid was like 5'9 and maybe 120lbs soaking wet. He groped the fuck out of him doing a way too invasive search and somehow the kids shirt ended up on the ground. The cop had radio'd for back up and one by one about a half dozen cop cars pulled into my gas station parking lot. There was probably 8 cops there each talking very aggressively to him and giving him commands. I could hear them discussing what they had on him and if they should bring him in. Cops were inspecting all the cars to see if he vandalized anything. I walked out and was just like, \"yo he didn't do nothing wrong what are you doing? My boss wants to know why all these cops are in his parking lot.\"\n\nThen just like that one by one they just... left. They didn't even really give the kid an explanation as to why they stopped him. Reports of attempted vandalism I guess. The kid just looked at me and shook his head. Just said, \"They took my smokes and all my cash.\" Kid couldn't even smoke a cigarette to relax. He didn't seem surprised by hiw the cops treated him at all. I didn't smoke but I bought him a pack. I couldn't believe what I'd witnessed and that really opened my eyes.",

This part was pretty wild.\n\n&gt; **Genesis** **19** New International Version (NIV)\nSodom and Gomorrah Destroyed\n\n&gt;**19** The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. ^^*2* \u201cMy lords,\u201d he said, \u201cplease turn aside to your servant\u2019s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cNo,\u201d they answered, \u201cwe will spend the night in the square.\u201d\n\n&gt;^^*3* But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. ^^*4* Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom\u2014both young and old\u2014surrounded the house. ^^*5* They called to Lot, \u201cWhere are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\u201d\n\n&gt;^^*6* Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him ^^*7* and said, \u201cNo, my friends. Don\u2019t do this wicked thing. ^^*8* Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don\u2019t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\u201d\n\n&gt;^^*9* \u201cGet out of our way,\u201d they replied. \u201cThis fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We\u2019ll treat you worse than them.\u201d They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.\n\n&gt;^^*10* But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. ^^*11* Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.\n\nAt this point the angels have transformed to take the images of man, but if you look at what an angel is described to be in the bible, well, its pretty crazy.\n\n&gt; **Isaiah 6:2** New International Version (NIV)\n\n&gt;^^*2* Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. \n\nA bit of an artists representation of [seraphim and cherubim angels](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c7/c4/6b/c7c46b1d8f3636b3292e0127cdf6be76.jpg)",

He too looks like he is looking at something with intention but there is nothing to imply what that could be and it muddles up the interpretation of we (the viewer) as a monster that has just opened the door to our sex slave dungeon. \n\nIf I could make a slight change in the composition it would be the have the boy either looking at the main girl in some way, looking down out of fear, or also looking directly at the viewer with a sort of defeated anger. \n\nIt's an unimportant minor criticism for a breathtakingly gorgeous piece though.\n\n**edit** [/u/SuchASpecialSnFlake has a great interpretation which negates my criticism entirely](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuchASpecialSnFlake) which is they are all also blind. *chef kiss* perfection.",

I look at the room and see soda bottles, syringes, a bucket of chicken. To me, these \u201cangels\u201d are addicts. Enchained by their unhealthy addictions. Their clipped wings show the potential, we as humans all have by being given the gift of life. We as the viewer are peering into the dark lives of these individuals, and our judging eyes are what cause the fear and tension of their expressions.",

Assessing the full scope of human trafficking is difficult because so cases so often go undetected, something the United Nations refers to as \u201cthe hidden figure of crime.\u201d\n\n&gt; Estimates suggest that, internationally, only about .04% survivors of human trafficking cases are identified, meaning that the vast majority of cases of human trafficking go undetected. [3]\n\n&gt;Human trafficking earns global profits of roughly $150 billion a year for traffickers, $99 billion of which comes from commercial sexual exploitation.[4]\n\n&gt;Globally, an estimated 71% of enslaved people are women and girls, while men and boys account for 29%.[5]\n\n&gt;Estimates suggest that about 50,000 people are trafficked into the US each year, most often from Mexico and the Philippines. [6]\n\n&gt;In 2018, over half (51.6%) of the criminal human trafficking cases active in the US were sex trafficking cases involving only children.[7]\n\n&gt;Reports indicate that a large number of child sex trafficking survivors in the US were at one time in the foster care system. [8]\n\n&gt;Advocates report a growing trend of traffickers using online social media platforms to recruit and advertise targets of human trafficking.[9]\n\n&gt;The average age a teen enters the sex trade in the US is 12 to 14 years old. Many victims are runaway girls who were sexually abused as children.\n\n[source](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-human-trafficking)",

It's part of what makes this piece so interesting, in my opinion. \n\nHeroin definitely does not make you disconnected or docile from trafficking though. There's functional addicts all around you that can work fine, drive, or any other cognitive task (unless they've taken too much and then they just \"nod\" which is basically like sleeping). The part that destroys them is when they become physically dependent, and then they get sick if they don't have it. And most addicts use to escape trauma or mental illness so when in conjunction with that psychological need, that's when they'll do anything to get well.\n\nEither way, I think the piece is awesome and I love that the artist depicted such a gruesome yet captivating scene. It's not horror or gore, but it evokes similar feeling, at least to me.",

Some time later the family had a picture sent to them that showed the missing girl chained to a bed and staring at the camera.\n\nI can't remember the story, but I will never forget the picture, and that same expression on her face, the terrified, but angry look that just screamed: \"the second I think I have a shot I will tear out your fucking eyes\" matched this almost exactly.\n\nI can't help but wonder if it was an inspiration for this image because it strikes so many similarities.",

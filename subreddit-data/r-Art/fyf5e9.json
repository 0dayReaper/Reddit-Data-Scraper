But the most important factor is that these food sources are reach in beta carotene, which is reddish-orangish in color. \n\nWhile my food source above wasn't exactly spot on, the comment that flamingos get their color from their food is correct. And to answer your question, yes you could turn \"pink\" but you'd have to eat a crap ton.\n\n[Source](https://www.britannica.com/amp/story/why-are-flamingos-pink)",

I think it\u2019s the mixture of slow and fast movements. \n\nWhen I was younger I kept having these dreams/nightmares that were a bit like this and but with people. Like all the rooms of my house were super compressed and like all the furniture was too big for the room. Everyone moved like those flamingos in a snappy fast type of way but then their overall movements were slow. \n\nEverything was super colourful like the saturation of colours got turned all the way up and everyone was like laughing all the time. Everything was weirdly round and \u201cchunky\u201d\n\nIt was weird because I could never wake myself up while I was having the dreams and I knew I was dreaming but then when I\u2019d wake up, I\u2019d want to go back to that weird place for some reason like an addiction but I could never instigate that weird state despite instigating other lucid dreams. \n\nSometime I still get flash backs to those dreams  but it\u2019s weird because I used to love them when not dreaming it but wanting to get back in it when not in it if that makes sense. \n\nThis animation is probably the closest thing I\u2019ve seen that describes it. I can\u2019t stop watching and hate watching but once I stop I just want to look at it some more. \n\nAnyone have similar experiences/know what I\u2019m on about? \n\nSuper weird comment but this is reddit so whatever.",

In the west, it was a way of cooking down the less appetizing/cheaper fruit in a syrup to a saucy consistency to keep longer. In the East, they took fruit and sugar and cooked it into a syrupy drink that also keeps longer as winter sets in.\n\n\nThe preparation is honestly quite similar, just a lot more liquid added for kompot whereas compote has very little added.",

Once in a while an extremely skilled photographer might catch an exact moment of emotion at the exact right angle, but a photo by definition can only show a single instant in time, the way it actually was at that millisecond and that millisecond only (other than timelapse of course but that\u2019s in a different way). But we don\u2019t actually see things that way. We see everything in constant motion. A painting can adjust \u201creality\u201d in such a way that you can pick up emotions you wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to see without seeing the person in motion - and therefore can come closer to \u201creality\u201d than a photo.",

This is all just my opinion and how I feel, of course.\n\nThe first thing I did after reading the comment was revisit the post\u2019s painting. It evokes a lot of emotions but for the sake of brevity I can seriously feel her stress and tiredness. Yet the subject\u2019s expression, while first showing stress, does not show the countenance of someone overwhelmed or even a student with a dream detoured. I can see and I actually feel the devotion. \n\nFor a more scientific approach I would like to refer you to \u201cMirror Neurons\u201d https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron. For the uninitiated, this semi-recent discovery explains why we can sometimes know what the other person is thinking throughout conversation. Even if we can\u2019t put into words their vibe, we kinda know, ya know? Humans are pack-animals at the end of the day and it turns out there is actual evidence to support the clich\u00e9 sentiment, \u201cI feel your pain.\u201d Empathy response systems mirror the exact neurons firing off in another person\u2019s brain when we talk to them, making their feelings literally our feelings. But down to the point: There are an untold countless amount of facial expression variations that you don\u2019t know you know and can pick up on. This is why lying is difficult no matter how good someone might think they are. A person must lie to themselves before they can lie to another. Past that, a split second face called a \u201cmicro-expressions\u201d can especially trigger mirror neurons. Micro-expressions are said to be involuntary tells a person\u2019s face makes that can trigger the listener\u2019s mirror neurons and they happen in a literal fraction of a second. \n\nSo my theory is that it\u2019s possible, a photo, being just an unorthodox and split second of time that most people usually pose for, is less honest than a skilled artist\u2019s recreation of the subject as they felt at the time. This is because it doesnt capture the essence of how a person feels in their core and might be suppressing additional complex emotions without knowing. To portray that precise moment is something a photographer would need to be very fortunate with timing to capture. This painting took time and allowed the listener, or painter, to describe the subject precisely as she was at that point in time.  \n\nPheew. Hope that makes sense. Thank you for helping me put this idea/theory into words.",

The fact that the color of the wall and the furniture remind me so much on a gut level of the buildings I used to attend church in.....\n\nI\u2019m sure our interpretation is only one of many possibilities but I find it fascinating that we both saw that in this painting",

More specificity her music is mostly about lesbian romance and her name is so synonymous with being lesbian that asking a woman if you she likes the Girl in Red is equivalent to asking if she is interested in women. Do take this with a grain of salt though as I am a bi man who just enjoys queer music",

I like the little things like the two books that she's bumped into and moved slightly out of place, or the painting that is cut off at the top before you can tell what it is.  It makes it interesting to look at versus a usual arrangement.  Thanks for sharing it.",

The red uniform ties back to the A and suggests the link is in education as does the book. The girls demeanor is depressed and exhausted, perhaps suggesting that the \"red A\" is something forced on her - she is taught she is covered in the red shame of the \"A\" and seems to have given in to this.\n\nI am not if this what you were intending with it but this is what I got.

The students clearly understood computers and the Internet better than the teachers and it made certain classes feel very backwards and obsolete sometimes. I don't think I checked a single non-fiction book out of my high school's library but every year we had a lesson on the Dewey Decimal System and how important it is. I also remember being told to use Yahoo instead of Google because of its \"more professional and thorough homepage.\"",

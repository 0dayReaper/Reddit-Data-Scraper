Because it's associated with the movie, and not any individual artist's interpretation, I'm going to call it \"fair use as satire\".\n\nHow you feel about the subject matter is up to you.

I went back to that church last year because I was visiting my grandma and it means a lot to her. They preached LGBT community is Satan's army and the cause of all their problems somehow. I couldn't believe how far it has gone since I was last there. They've always had backwards views but something has gotten more extreme lately. Luckily I talked to my grandma about it and she mostly agreed. She just has a Bible study with close friends now and they actually talk about what Jesus wanted from his followers. I'm still not religious but it's nice to see her get away from that hate. I guess having multiple grandkids in the LGBT community makes it hard to believe they're entities of Satan",

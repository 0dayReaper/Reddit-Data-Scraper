In that light, it's kind of bold and fitting to hide the window behind the woman. In a 'so iconic we can separate it from its original reference entirely and everybody still gets the point' kinda way.\n\n(Still would have loved to a gothic arch *somewhere*, but that's just me lol)",

Very subtle, very nice.  \n\n\nAlso, in American Gothic, building patterns are repeated in the couple's clothing. The stairs are extended in the woman's rickrack trim, her pinafore's print is similar to that on the curtain, and the man's shirt bears vertical stripes as do the house, the barn, and the barn roof. However, I saw none of this before his shirt's breast seams appeared as a pitchfork, just like the one in his hand.  \n\n\nIn Black Gothic, the trim on the boy's vest and on the lady's sweater seem to mimic the stacked bricks of the house.",

The \u201cgothic\u201d aspect is the window between the two people.\n\nWhile the title is obviously just referencing the style and the way the people are placed, it\u2019s not wrong to look for ways it ties to the theme of the original painting. They\u2019re just having fun speculating, no need to be a buzzkill.",

Nobody says they're derivative, either. \n\nI don't think it's lost anything. I love it. \n\nThe irony of all of these comments saying the architecture is wrong, the landscape isn't authentic, etc. Grant Wood painted rolling hills in Iowa; I think he'd forgive a little artistic license.",

Its origin is attributed to English author [Horace Walpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Walpole), with his 1764 [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel) [*The Castle of Otranto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Otranto), subtitled (in its second edition) \"A Gothic Story\".\n\n\\- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction)",

It's now a completely different piece where the characters are more relaxed and seem to have their gaze on a future full of hope. Maybe that was the intention. I think this one would have benefited from using the same style as the original.",

I just think the painting could have been stronger if the artist had fully embraced the original or subverted it even more. It's still a fine piece. \n\nFor some reason I associate the visuals with Spiderman and the father with Michael Jordan. The latter I think is understandable, but I don't quite get the former.",

I\u2019m not familiar with this illustrator\u2019s work off the top of my head, but I believe as others have mentioned this piece doesn\u2019t reciprocate the atmosphere of the original. I believe that this was unintentional by the artist of \u201cBlack Gothic\u201d due to viewing the first as racially exclusive over anything, omitting the nature of what American Gothic truly portrays.\n\n\nEdit: I partially take that back. I noticed a few things with the way the painting was done. It\u2019s an outer city household in place of the seemingly rural original. You can tell by the suburban facade of the house and the skyscrapers in the background, which I assume would be downtown. Curiously, they decided to retain what seems to be a church spire on the left side and the same treeline with the only difference being the addition of a city skyline.\n\nMy second take is that this either portrays the evolution of society over time (unlikely), or is just a downright awful attempt to implement racial inclusion to a classic American masterpiece with unhealthy amounts of disrespect and prejudice to the original artist. Keep in mind this is also often used as a satirical template.",

I get that this was probably done by an amateur. But it's a pathetic grab at a current hot button issue.

Sound overall is really good.\n\nBut for $150-$170 you could arugue there are better earbuds. Personally I've not regretted getting them.",

There are some tablets that have a screen and you can see the image changing under the pencil (like a Cintiq, XP-Pen or even an IPad with the Apple Pencil, although that's a bit small) while other more affordable tablets are screenless and work similar to a big touchpad and you have to look at your work on a monitor on the side... the software has specific paintbrush tools (imagine a very spiced up version of MS Paint), but no matter how advanced the software you still have to use the brush with the right stroke, technique and pressure to get it to look like this and not a solid MS-Paint-looking splotch of color.\n\nI draw and paint fairly decently on traditional media, and I have tried using my daughter's art tablet a couple of times (an XP-Pen 15.6 Pro, with screen) but it definitely requires a re-learning process to get the hang of it.  Her brush lines are smooth and you can see them changing thickness and color intensity as they flow, and mine were consistently thick and solid despite using the same tool.",

If you want something that works independently and on the go, then an iPad with the Apple Pencil is the way, although it gives you a smaller surface to work compared to a digital tablet.",

Some go further still to claim that the artist was infatuated with her and possibly even having an affair with her.

Even with major animation studios like Disney you see the shift from the hand drawn shit with fairly reasonable proportions to everyone having the giant elsa anime eyes, such a turn off for me. Obviously animation has to be somewhat hyper-expressive but illustrations and shit should be able to capture emotion without resorting to grotesquely exaggerating features. The sad thing is this artist probably has the talent to do it, but that style is so popular they adopt it and cheapen their work, at least in my eyes. \n\nOf course, it\u2019s all subjective, but that\u2019s my take on the manga eyes. And what isn\u2019t subjective is the fact that in anime, all kinds of shortcuts are used to crank out material, shortcuts that look awful on static illustrations that aren\u2019t animated but people still use for some reason (eg eyes occluding hair that\u2019s supposed to be above them)",

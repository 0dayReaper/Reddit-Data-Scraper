If I could give you one piece of advice. You've got to believe in yourself because no one else will. I went from the being the pothead in high school with a 1.9 gpa to being a college grad  with a 3.75 gpa to corporate developer with a sizable salary to a business owner with unlimited freedom. No one believed in me back then even when I started my own business my wife thought I was crazy. I had to see it for myself and believe I could do it before it became a reality. There's a quote that always stuck with me by T.E. Lawrence, \"all men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous man, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.\"",

You know that as long as you keep climbing, you're doing exactly what you need to do and your freetime is your own to spend as you see fit. There is a goal in mind and all ladders and stairs lead up to reaching it.\n\nOnce you graduate, it's a mindfuck. There are no rules. You have goals, sure. Career goals. Financial goals. Relationship goals. But there is no clear path to reach them. Imagine that suddenly instead of a bunch of stairs and ladders leading to one place, you have a bunch of stairs and ladders leading to an unknown place- many of which have no top, others of which the stairs and ladders have broken segments that can't be crossed over. Some paths might zig zag along for extended periods before reaching a top. Some might zig zag all over the place and suddenly end with NO top. Time is the biggest question out there. How much time do you have to commit to one staircase or ladder before giving up on it and trying another path?",

France will also need to be delt with and the Ottomans will always be a threat. We might actually be able to ally Poland and use them to defend against France if they decide they have claims on Germany. Also the possibility of expanding down into the Italian states should be explored as cities live Venice provide a nice boost to our income. Also in our war with France we really should look to take portions of Southern France. We should also look for any opportunity to help the English when they attack France as the English, while having a small army, can blockade the French and their army, while small, could distract France long enough for Poland to reinforce our positions in Eastern France for the 1st Austria War of Conquest against France. Those are your orders gentlemen, I expect to be dining in Versailles by the end of the year of our lord 1556",

I did my \"mandatory learning\".

Every word you speak plays a song in my head, and that song is the stupid royalty free ukulele you hear on everything from animal rescue promos to charity foundation adverts. Picture any stereotypically \"wholesome\" scenario you can and chances are it's filling the air with relaxed strings and chipper bells.\n\nIt cheerily strums its way into your heart and refuses to leave until it's clogged your arteries with sweetness. I hate that song and feel entirely wronged by your brazen refusal to turn it off. Please turn it off.\n",

I believe that it is offensive because it is so overtly untrue to most adults, making \"saccharine\" an even better term than originally intended due to its contemporaneous association with synthetic sweeteners.  And funnily enough, they are usually compounds called \"sugar alcohols\", conveying a sense of unpleasant intoxication upon excess consumption.",

If/when you graduate, you apply to hundreds of jobs and the one that accepts you, probably isn't 100% apart of the plan for what you went to school for.  So you make a choice. A choice which forms the direction your life/career will go.  The only expectation is to stay afloat and sometimes that won't play out how you want either. i'm only 29 years old but i feel like if i went back and redid high school through college then i would have treated it differently.  is it weird to say that life got harder after schooling, but it also got a lot better?",

There is vertical and upwards movement all the time as in you are moving from one class/standard to the higher one. At times it resembles more of a pipeline movement as in once you enter the schooling system, there is a great likelihood that you will come out after clearing all the stages and the time of your exit is also defined. Although at a defined pace but there is progress all the time. \n\nBut after that it is all open. There is not much structure and not much pre defined paths. For some it is the absolute freedom and they can reach where their imaginations, efforts and capabilities can take them and that there is no limit to it. It is infinite in that sense. For some others, it is total cluenessness and they miss that structured and defined path. It is a struggle to figure out things and to keep moving upwards all the time and this might feel like stagnation. \n\nLife is that open space only. When we are out there at our own and without the constant supervision/guidance of teachers and parents. And what we do in that open space is what defines us.. :)\n",

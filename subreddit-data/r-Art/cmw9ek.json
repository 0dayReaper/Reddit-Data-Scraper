Pure raw energy, and their lyrics are unapologetic-ally progressive. Their new album has a song called [\"Samaritans\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2pZRifgIo) that promotes men sharing their feelings, a song [\"Danny Nedelko\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkF_G-RF66M) that celebrates immigrants, and a song [\"Television\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK0IoBb-nhM) that promotes loving yourself and not comparing yourself to what you see on TV.\n\nDave Grohl once said that the best bands are either a fucking trainwreck or the greatest thing you've ever seen live, and Nirvana was one of those bands. I kinda find Idles in a similar vein. [This is an early big-show they did that really encapsulates exactly who they are.](https://youtu.be/k9DI2pV0h40) Most of the audience has absolutely no idea who they are. They open the show kissing each other, finish playing to a solid ovation, and close by hugging the security guys for doing a good job.",

Maternal blood alcohol levels must attain 300 mg/dl before significant side effects are reported in the infant.

Alcohol levels are usually highest in breast milk 30-60 minutes after an alcoholic beverage is consumed, and can be generally detected in breast milk for about 2-3 hours per drink after it is consumed. However, the length of time alcohol can be detected in breast milk will increase the more alcohol a mother consumes. For example, alcohol from 1 drink can be detected in breast milk for about 2-3 hours, alcohol from 2 drinks can be detected for about 4-5 hours, and alcohol from 3 drinks can be detected for about 6-8 hours, and so on.",

But luckily the alcohol comes by way of a sugary liquid, mitigating the effects of the very small quantity of alcohol. Obviously we can't have controlled studies, so we can't know the effects of mother's consumption of alcohol on breastfeeding infants. It's confounded by other factors. So everything says don't do it,  just to be safe. \n\nSo bottom line, it's not recommended. But the recommendation is not well supported, and the exposure to alcohol is quite minute. Reasonable people could conclude that totally abstaining is exercising an overabundance of caution.",

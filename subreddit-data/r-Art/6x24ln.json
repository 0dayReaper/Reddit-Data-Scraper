I could have let it go on, but if you want me to answer you about my deep intentions, here I go: Originally, I am an user of the Polandball subreddits (yes, now it looks pretty trivial, but one has to begin somewhere!), and one rule states that all drawings must be done with MsPaint. I began like all of you, drawing circles and rectangles and filling in the blank spaces with horrible fluo colors. But the subject and the media fascinated me very quickly, and the texture permitted by it was simply fabulous. So, I have continued to draw on MsPaint for long, and I never felt the urge to change, mostly because other softwares were too expensive/ too complicated to take in hand. And honestly again, I love the fact that despite the media being so often qualified as \"na\u00efve\" or \"trivial\", one can actually make very detailed artworks like this one. This discrepency between the means and the ends is really thought-provoking, to my mind. It would be like... composing a music piece using only one note! [Oh wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIs3jechQ_E)...\n\nEdit: Seriously... thank you for the gold!",

Drawing a portrait with a set of kickass prismacolor drawing pens of varying thicknesses makes execution much easier than drawing with a bic pen. But if you can accomplish the same level of detail and beauty with a bic pen, you are definitely the bigger badass.\n\nThe end result is not the only thing that matters to many artists - the process of getting there is equally important.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, begging to have OP respond to you definitely classifies you as kind of a wimp.",

Games exist through rules and limitations on play that present challenges for the player to overcome. \n\nWhile you could change or ignore the rules of a board game or use cheat codes in a video game to ease or remove those limitations, you're often left with a much less satisfying experience. \n\nWith art, learning and mastering the \"rules\" of a medium (and in many cases, breaking them) is just as an important part of the experience as the end result.

So I would be a 'kind of a wimp' for wanting the opinion of someone who has kindly posted their artwork in a subreddit dedicated to the discussion of art.\n\nPlease don't be offended by someone asking for the artist's own opinion. It's certainly encouraging to discuss and speculate why artists choose unconventional mediums, but answering on the artists behalf is not the same thing. \n\nAs for your reply, I thought your original reply was interesting, I have even \"up voted\" it. But as for the oddly aggressive edit you have made - I feel like you're reading too much into the posts here. Take a moment to review other replies and you'll notice that many other people have also answered on behalf of the artist, the function of my edit is really because I'm curious what the artist has to say - not someone who has no more information on the topic than any other user of this website.",

Where the attention was in the shapes and \"conveying\" objects and the scene with slabs of color, without sketching up real-life-like lines and shades.\n\n\"Pixel art\" as most agree, is when each individual pixel is placed with intention, even in larger pieces.\n\nI apologize for this reply which you didn't solicit. This art is nonetheless spectacular and whatever you'd call it, I'd love to get a print if had the money.",

The air is so refreshing and I was having a great time. Everything made me feel happy. Now I'm sitting at my apartment in California, facing the hottest week, my long time girlfriend just left me 3 months ago. I've been having a hard time ever since. \n\nThis pic all of sudden brought me back to that evening in New York, everything seems so beautiful and peaceful. What a great work!\n",

So they try something new and get discouraged very quickly at how bad they are at it, and just give up.",

He prints his subject picture to scale, and then creates a grid. He then painstakingly adds each dab of paint as though they were pixels on the grid that correspond exactly to the printed picture. While I find these hyper-realist paintings cool to look at, they don\u2019t impress me as much.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is still difficult to do, but far less interesting since this exists as a photo and he\u2019s just replicating it using math.",

I've seen a few people in these comments saying something to this effect, that it's basically paint-by-numbers, it's an exercise in technical skill etc - but I'm sorta like, 'so...?' If this is what he enjoys doing, isn't *that* the point? Why is it less 'interesting' because he has developed a system for doing it? \n\nOr am I just completely on the wrong track? I am not artsy, at ALL (I know, what a shock :D) so is he doing something... wrong, by painting them this way?",

There\u2019s a market for his work, and he enjoys doing it so there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you find this art amazing, you\u2019re not wrong either.\n\nThe reason I don\u2019t enjoy hyper-realist art is because it\u2019s typically based on existing photographs of subjects, food or items, or a carbon copy of a landscape or something similar. The reason I mentioned his technique specifically is because this painting isn\u2019t just a result of his artistic skill, but rather his patience and technical use of a grid. Any skilled painter with patience could also create this sort of realism. It\u2019s worth mentioning how he created it because people might get discouraged looking at this thinking they\u2019ll never be as good. I promise you he couldn\u2019t create a painting this realistic without this technical method either.\n\nI prefer art that tells a story where there\u2019s more to it than just the way it looks. For instance [this piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/e58o07/angels_yuliya_litvinova_digital_2019/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ) here was most likely painted with references, but the artist created a unique composition with a powerful story. The more you look at it, the more you notice until you feel like you\u2019re the person who\u2019s standing at the door. This to me is what art is all about, but the beauty of art is that it\u2019s different for everyone. So while I may not find JW\u2019s art impressive from an artistic standpoint, you might feel different, and neither is us are wrong \ud83d\ude0a.",

However whenever I see work like this which is an exact reproduction of a photo, my immediate thought is \u201cwhat did reproducing the image in the other medium add to the photo and why not just print a larger photo?\u201d \n\nI can understand enlarging a photo of wrinkly faces grandmother could be used for a particular kind of installation, but who needs a very high quality painting of wet hair? His choice of subject matter and composition in this case leaves everything to be desired in my humble opinion. I think he might benefit from having a visionary art director or mentor to help him work out the plan for the artwork. He clearly has a lot of technical ability and talent. From here he should learn to produce art that evokes something other than, \u201cyeah that looks like something any person might see any Tuesday afternoon at a swimming pool.\u201d",

If all it adds is \u201cwow can\u2019t believe it\u2019s not a photograph\u201d then it seems like a shallow use of the medium. Sure it\u2019s impressive that the artist can grid/project the image onto the canvas and color match the photo and that falls somewhere under the umbrella of art but there\u2019s a lot of artists who can do and have done that. What makes this special besides \u201ccan\u2019t believe it\u2019s not a photo\u201d? \n\nIf the success of this painting is dependent on its relationship to not being a photograph than it is not a successful painting and is only a successful not-photograph which happens to be painted.",

Strictly as a matter of my opinion, photorealism like this is vastly more uninteresting than it would have been with a \"painterly\" quality to it. I do not understand the point of doing something like this when, exactly as  you said, a photo would have the same effect, with far less work.\n\nThat's not to say I don't appreciate this artist's attention to light, shadow, color, etc. That does require a keen eye for the photo-realism to work. But, I feel that level of understanding of those aspects could be put to use elsewhere for more compelling pieces.",

The art is in the interpretation of reality, not just copying it. I imagine doing this is helping the artist to develop skill in rendering\n\nedit: changed \"skill\" to \"understanding\". There is obviously skill here as far as confident strokes goes, but what I'm getting at is there is basically zero artistic interpretation of the photograph. It is a tracing. It's much easier to directly copy than you might think. You'd be impressed at what you can do right now using the grid method.\n\nThat is not to under-value drawing from reference, but IMO references should not be traced but pulled apart, understood, and reconstructed. I'd much rather see an interpretive work with far LESS detail. To me, art is in the simplification, and this work shows no skill for reduction or simplification of shape.\n\nIt's still art but I'm just explaining why it doesn't do anything for me. It does show some skill as far as looking at a photograph and copying what you see (although this really appears to be a tracing to me, and not interpretation or even sight-copying), and for having confident line strokes.",

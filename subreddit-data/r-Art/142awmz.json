It's so awesome and to go back to the official app would just make me use Reddit far less.\n\nIt's a shame because Reddit is an amazing source for news articles, from local to global, the latest in science and tech, and so many awesome communities for my hobbies but thr official experience is actually frustrating. It also leaves apps that convert Reddit into a digestible format for anyone with disabilities completely hung out to dry.\n\nThat's assuming the place won't go to shit without auto-mods.\n\nI suspect Reddit will rethink this but I doubt their new solution will please us much more. Could be the end of an era, however, I really hope it isn't.\n\nI wonder how well \"Alternatives to Reddit\" is trending on Google right now.",

If you've every played dungeons and dragons, it more or less uses the same system.\n\nYou have you base stats Intellect (intelligence), Psyche (wisdom), Physique (strength), and Motorics (dexterity). Those are further broken down into specific skills, so stuff like logic, empathy, endurance, reaction speed, etc. where the base stat is going to govern how many of your skill points you can put into those skills. \n\nMany of those skills have weird sounding names (Half-light, Inland Empire, etc.)  that don't really tell you off the bat what they do, but they all have descriptions which do a good job at teaching you what each skill does.\n\nThe rest of the game is pretty straightforward, you're a detective who has amnesia and you're tasked with solving a murder mystery. I will say that the game isn't for everyone. It's a slower pace game, and closer to a visual novel than a video game. Not to mention that has a lot of reading, so if you're adverse to games like that, then it probably isn't for you. But if none of that dissuades you from it, then I'd highly recommend Disco Elysium.",

It's very much in the spirit of older rpgs, where your character isn't supposed to be good at everything. While that may mean you miss some stuff, that also means any combination is going to be fine, it just depends on what type of character you want to play as.\n\nWhen I played, I was roleplaying as a physically strong cop who acts like a pushover/softie (so basically a big teddy bear) and I made my best guess as to which traits would that character be good at. \n\nDon't get too caught up with trying to find the most optimal build, Disco Elysium isn't like Dark Souls or Skyrim. All the \"combat\" in this game is done through skill checks and dialogue, so just pick the skills that you imagine the character you're building would be good at.",

They've done such a good job, infact, that it seriously rivals the paid software used by professionals in the VFX industry (eg. Maya, 3DS Max).\n\nNot only that, but it is an 'all-in-one' package. You can perform many functions and mediums inside Blender that would typically require several different paid programs (eg. 2D animation, 3D animation, volumetrics, compositing, video editing, sculpting and many more).\n\nNaturally, being a free program, there is also plenty of tutorials available online to learn from, making the barrier to entry even lower.\n\nIn short, Blender has empowered countless artists to create incredible projects such as this one without charging a dime. A great example of what can happen when a community of like-minded individuals put their skills together. Last but not least, it's an ever evolving project that will only continue to get better!\n\nCheck out the r/blender subreddit for more info!",

It doesn't lean into the direction of travel at the same time as it moves that direction.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.  Again, I love the style and animation immensely, but I think more correct physics would really make it \"pop\"",

Movement in animation is hard to do right, and it is easy to get stuck in an uncanny valley when stuff is just a little bit off.  \n\nObviously the artist is trying to convey something specific with the animation, right?  The idea of weaving through traffic to deliver packages.  And the urgency and inertia of that concept are best communicated through realistic motion.  \n\nObviously, perfect realism is not the object here, and that's not what I'm suggesting.  What I'm saying is that the animation as it stands currently does not communicate the feeling of weaving through traffic as well as it could, due to a misunderstanding of the mechanics involved. \n\nImagine trying to communicate the idea or feeling of hand-sewing a clothing patch, but the sewer is simply lifting the needle up and down, pricking the surface of the clothing with its tip.  The action MAY communicate the concept of sewing to some people, but likely not to anyone who has actually sewn.  It will be distracting in it's inaccuracy.  That doesn't mean the art is bad, it means someone people may find the inaccuracy distracting. \n\nAnd that's all I was claiming in the first place.",

The front wheel is facing right the entire time the scooter is turning right which would result in continuous left turn. The same is true when the scooter is turning the wheel to the left. The result would be a continuous right turn. You cannot steer a two wheeled vehicle like that without countersteering at all.\n\nIf you want to be correct with the physics of the gif, a change to the left lane would require a brief turn of the bars to the right, and the bars would then appear to be relatively straight to the scooter for the duration of the lane change. But anyway it doesn't matter it's just a drawing.",

Get on a bicycle or motorcycle, get going faster than walking speed, push on one handlebar.  If you push on the left bar, you go right.  If you push on the right bar, you go left.\n\nTo turn you must lean, and to lean you are \"driving\" the tires out from under the bike to make it essentially fall over into the direction you want to turn.",

Rainbow Road kept the Void from advancing towards us, and the MLP/Undertale/Random art to the East didn't encroach upon our little banner. All in all it was a very good spot.",

One spammer or botter can ruin conversation in an entire community. They're persistent and their work - ruining - is easier than building. Like with last year's April Fools, Robin, how it only took 1 person spamming nonsense to seriously disrupt a chat of 16 or 32 people. So you get this idea that a good portion of people are terrible, because a good deal of what you see is terribleness. \n\nBut when you limit everyone to each having the same impact, so one ruiner can only post one pixel at a time - or two or three, if they have some alts - and each creator can place the same number of pixels, the sheer overwhelming number of good people becomes apparent. Someone puts down a pixel to mess something up, someone else puts down a pixel to fix it, and a second person puts down a pixel to build it further. Progress is made. The void was beaten back every time, and I'm sure it would have been again if the experiment had gone on a few hours longer. \n\nPeople had a huge canvas that they could do anything with, and they chose to fill it with really cool things and expressions of teamwork and love. And they successfully fought off the few who tried to ruin it. Because that's what humans do, when the impact of terrible people isn't disproportionately distorted by the nature of the internet.",

We had /r/Scotland and /r/RocketLeague near us, and there were some bots that kept trying to make some flag right on us, and a couple people placing pixels in the middle of designs. We all helped protect each other. \n\nWe really had a strong alliance formed, and helped each other. Another nearby ally gave up a little bit of their turf for us to expand and make our design even cooler. \n\nWould have been really interesting to see this go on longer, what would happen? Would \"governments\" form between large designs? Like what if there were two huge entities next to each other and they had a treaty between each other, like don't mess with me, and you'll be okay? And then someone breaches the border, and the one side gets pissed off and invades the other and destroys their design... would people have gotten together to stop the Black Plague?\n\nAmazing.

Humans started it, humans created the bots and told them what to do. However this thing turned out, it was still something put together by people coming together - whether they manipulated it with bots they created or did it by hand on their own. Until we have true AI, I don't think we can argue that humans weren't involved with each other even if it was partially through bots interacting. ",

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the Midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",

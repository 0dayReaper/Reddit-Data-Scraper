So it seemed the protestor did have the intention to suicide, but ultimately and unfortunately he slipped off. Also corrected \"bridge\" to \"building\". RIP\n\nRelying this for visibility.\n\nHope others can see this, but the protestor **DID NOT SUICIDE AND JUMP OFF THE BUILDING.**\n\nWhat actually happened was he climbed to the top of a building near the govt HQ to hang a banner showing opposition to the extradition bill. After hours of stand-off between him and the firemen (rescuer), he climbed further out to a more dangerous position. The firemen got hold of him, but unfortunately his clothes went loose and he slipped off to the ground, missing the yellow rescue cushion below.\n\n**The protestor may have the intention to suicide but ultimately it was an unfortunate accident.**\n\nRIP\n\nSources:\n\nVideo: http://s.nextmedia.com/realtime/a.php?i=20190615&amp;s=10829391&amp;a=59719455\n\nEnglish news: https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/15/man-protesting-hong-kongs-extradition-law-unconscious-jumping-mall-admiralty/",

As I recall, standard Chinese government practice is to bring troops in from a distant province that have no social connection to the local population, so they will not be as hesitant to shoot the place up. \n\nAlso, I think that the Chinese government has an opinion that Hong Kong is representative of imperialism, of the rest of the world fucking over China for a long time, and now is the time to stamp that shit out, and to take its rightful place as a world power. Caving in to HK would be a sign of weakness.\n\nMaybe things will change in 25, 50, 100 years, from within, but any attempt at the outside world to effect change in China will be seen as outside influence. As I recall, the United States tried to dislocate the communists from mainland China after WW2, and it was a failure. I recall some post WW2 headline of a USA newspaper of \"One billion dollars down a rathole\" over that effort. If it didn't work back then, guess how much luck it would have now, with a pretty darn good military, and with sheer numbers on its side. The USA also tried to help the 'White Russians' around 1917 or 1918 with little luck.\n\nBasically, the residents of HK are fucked.",

Basically it doesn't matter what the Hong Kong people do, they would need more power in terms of support from companies in order to strong arm the Chinese governments influence. And that won't happen because the companies that can exert power are reliant on China's support. So most likely the Hong Kong government will just go about their ways screwing over their population because they're so pro-China at this point. It's an extremely tragic situation, but really nothing will be done about it because fucking politicians are the scum of the earth.\n\nEdit: Corrected spelling error",

I'm not sure they could get away with it as easily though. \n\nI'm fairly ignorant about China, but my best guess is that when Tiananmen Square happened China didn't have such a huge investment in pseudo-capitalism. Now that they do, there are a lot more individuals with money and power.  Even though an individual can only obtain such power by siding with the CCP. if a massacre happens they could turn against the leadership. \n\n(this could all be wrong, I'm just guessing)",

There\u2019s even a highly guarded border between the two. HongKong won\u2019t have to abide by all Chinese laws until at least a few more decades, but mainland China is trying to speed up this process with bills such as these. Mainland China is also upset by the fact that the current laws in HK allow for outright protest and civil disobedience (think Tiannemnan Square).  This is really scary, because it means the rights and freedoms of HK citizens are at stake as China continues to bulldoze over their limited sovereignty.",

If the US/Europe got together and put half the scantions on China that they put on North Korea, China would most likely bend the knee. \n\nThe problem is that 1) so much of our consumer manufacturing is done there and 2) it would likely cause an economic collapse of both the West and East. But that would happen with war, too, so start with the scantions. War with China would likely end with the deaths of hundreds of millions, which, is that worth freedom for Hong Kong?",

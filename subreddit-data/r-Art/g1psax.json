For many years people didn't realize that vermouth needs to be refrigerated, and has a shelf life of about 6 months after opening. So that bottle of Martini that's been on Dad's shelf for the past decade is actually rancid.  People thought vermouth tasted bad because what they were drinking was spoiled, and for this reason dry martinis started using almost no vermouth. Let me tell you though, a martini using good, fresh vermouth at the proper 2 to 1 ratio is pretty amazing.",

I like lithography and don't really have a problem with this post specifically, it looks cool and it's funny and likely an organic post. In the abstract, though, it's tiresome to have to weed through astroturfed posts on reddit that are just thinly concealed marketing attempts.",

'When I'm ... er ... concentrating,' he explained, 'I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold, and very well-made. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad. This drink's my own invention. I'm going to patent it when I think of a good name.'\n\n&gt;",

With a twist.\u201d And if it\u2019s a new place where she\u2019s not a regular she\u2019ll add, \u201cMake sure you shake it until there\u2019s little ice crystals in there.\u201d  \nLady knows exactly what she wants. Doesn\u2019t even bother calling it a martini.  \nAnd yeah, the idea of shaking lowering the proof of a drink is one of those qualitative vs quantitative things. The tiny bits that mix in with the liquid technically \u201cweaken\u201d it but probably not by even a percent.  \nIt\u2019s like when people say you should salt pasta water to lower the boiling point. Yes, adding salt to water lowers the boiling point. But the amount needed to lower it even a few degrees is so much you would spit it out.",

First of all, the trick to any good cocktail, is to vigoursly shake it.  Seriously, the harder you shake it, the better it will taste. Its chemistry.  However, because of the chemistry factor, you are not supposed to shake every drink.  You only shake drinks with citrus, cream, or coffee.  Most Martinis don't have any of those.  Most martini's are stirred, not shaken.  Thats why James Bond always tells his Bartender to shake the martini, not stirred.  James likes his Martini's in an atypical fashion.",

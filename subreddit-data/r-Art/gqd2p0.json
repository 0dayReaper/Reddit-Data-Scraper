One quick read on that: https://truewestmagazine.com/masters-of-western-art/ \n\nBut one can simply google Frederic Remington, he has some great art too. The colours are maybe not as bright though. George Phippen's paintings are already brighter. Modern days, you have quite many cowboy artists, one example being Jason Rich even if it is more photorealism at times.\n\nThough, yeah, what sets Mark Maggiori apart (the most obvious among many other things) and what makes so OP's painting can look like his style is the high contrast very detailed majestic or overwhelming clouds. The clouds are a character of their own. I know Maynard Dixon did some high contrast landscapes and gave a lot of room for striking clouds in some paintings, but never to Maggiori's extent. \n\nIn the end tho, gotta say I love the art style and the visuals, especially when they do a lot of work on the landscape and light effects. I don't care if it'd look like some Phoenix art gallery, I'd decorate my house with such paintings. And if anybody wants to see more bluebonnets, check out Julian Onderdonk's work",

Blackland Prairie was the biome best suited for farming and much of Texas developed within it (DFW, Waco, Temple, Austin, San Antonio). As such, it is the most endangered large ecosystem in the United States. \n\nThere are only a few hundred acres of preserved Blackland Prairie (near Frisco, TX) and a few thousand more of restored prairie. I recommend Clymer Preserve if you would like to see the prairie for yourself. It's magical, like a kelp forest. Buffalograss and indiangrass blowing in the wind as far as the eye can see!\n\nOP -- did you have a tribe in mind when you painted the rider? Looks like a Comanche warrior to me!!",

            "comment": "Is it just me or is using native american symbols in art a little strange? Its not so much this painting is deplorable when looked at in isolation, but when all art with native american subjects and created by white people is viewed, some clear consistent patterns emerge in how native Americans are represented. I suppose native americans are often used in art because of our perceptions of the native american culture being more spiritual or connected to nature and land, more so than we currently are. \n\nIn art, we often dont really attempt to really understand the full complexities of either old or modern native american culture. Native american culture is much more than just about being connected to nature and stuff, its as complex as any other culture. Also, modern native american culture is very rarely represented by outsiders, which makes me feel more certain that we may be using symbols from a culture because of what we want it to represent, rather than trying to understand it.   Why would this be bad though? Well maybe because it strengthens the perception of a culture as one dimensional and maybe even a little backwards while ignoring the technological advancements and large scale political and social structures that native americans had before we went in. \n\nEven if the artist has a strong connection to native americans, I do think the average American viewer would not and that this painting could only strengthen an already preconceived notion of native american culture. Really, I think native americans may be used as a place holder so we can get in touch with our own ancestors, humanity, and spirituality. I think we all have an interest in our own ancestor tribes from thousands of years ago but by using native americans as a place holder for our own perhaps spiritual ancestors, we strengthen the misconceptions of native americans. \n\nCurrently, native americans do not live in similar conditions to their settled neighbors. Maybe understanding them as they are and not as what we want them to be may be a step towards furthering fairness and their liberties.",

I may not be as familiar with native american art done by native american artists as other people but I have been to a native american exhibit in new mexico and it was clear that the usage of symbols was very different and the museum made clear which tribe/nation the art came from because each tribe/nation has different styles, traditions, etc. The end of the museum was just a room full pictures of places the zia sun symbol is used in pop culture and so forth. How the zia sun symbol is on the new mexico flag against the wishes of the zia people and also since new mexico doesnt even make enough concessions to native americans really drives home the problem",

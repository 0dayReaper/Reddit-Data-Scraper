            "comment": "I've always enjoyed mythology. Greek mythology in particular seems to have a lot of interesting situations, such as the whole story about Medusa. It seems to me that the legend illustrates the absolute unfairness of the gods quite well. This topic could be easily extrapolated to other themes of life, too... it's open to interpretation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe summary of the legend is that Medusa, originally a mortal, called Poseidon's attention because of how beautiful she was. He, naturally, decided to abuse her. But Medusa was a priestess of Athena --and as such, she had to remain pure. Since she commited the \"terrible sin\" of being violated, Athena took it out on her and turned her into a monster. The gods eventually sent Perseus to slay her and then her body was distributed among themselves as bounty.",

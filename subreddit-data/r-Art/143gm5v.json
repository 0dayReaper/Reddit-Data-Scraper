You can create an optical illusion with concave shapes that make them look convex but can give a weird tracking like effect. I believe it's related to the hollow face illusion but I'm not sure. If you want an easy example of this so you can see how the illusion works and see it when it break look up the dragon illusion. It's a paper cut out that looks like a dragon that turns to look at you. You can actually print the template and try it yourself.",

The lighting/shadowing on the right arm (the viewer\u2019s right/the subject\u2019s left arm) is rounded in a way that makes it look like a third breast. I had to look at it for a while to understand what was happening. I want to stress that the painting as a whole is absolutely gorgeous. Just one little nitpick",

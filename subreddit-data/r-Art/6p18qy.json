But they acquired greatness, became \u201cgeniuses\u201d (as we say) through qualities about whose lack no man aware of them likes to speak; all of them had that diligent seriousness of a craftsman, learning first to form the parts perfectly before daring to make a great whole. They took time for it, because they had more pleasure in making well something little or less important, than in the effect of a dazzling whole. For example, it is easy to prescribe how to become a good short story writer, but to do it presumes qualities which are habitually overlooked when one says, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough talent.\u201d Let a person make a hundred or more drafts of short stories, none longer than two pages, yet each of a clarity such that each word in it is necessary; let him write down anecdotes each day until he learns how to find their most concise, effective form; let him be inexhaustible in collecting and depicting human types and characters; let him above all tell tales as often as possible, and listen to tales, with a sharp eye and ear for the effect on the audience; let him travel like a landscape painter and costume designer; let him excerpt from the various sciences everything that has an artistic effect if well portrayed; finally, let him contemplate the motives for human behavior, and disdain no hint of information about them, and be a collector of such things day and night. In this diverse exercise, let some ten years pass: and then what is created in the workshop may also be brought before the public eye.\n\n\nNietzsche.  Human, All Too Human.",

In one episode I remember him saying he would spend hours on a single painting, before discovering Bill Alexander and taking the meditative approach of creating a world in half hour's time using wet on wet technique. The techniques he used I wouldn't describe as abstract in any sense, but can appear that way as he's building the image. Any unfinished painting can appear to have \"abstract methods\" especially when you see unlayered textures or blending starting to be built on top of each other like in The Joy of Painting.",

Much like what I'm about to do here. \n\nMusic suffers from the exact same technical fetish. \n\nFor example, a kid playing guitar might pick it up because he likes the sounds of Hendrix or Clapton. Then, an 'expert' whispers in his ear that only plebes like Clapton and here... Listen to Eddie Van Halen. So he listens to Van Halen and he's blown away by all that technique. Another \"expert\" comes along and tells him that only plebes listen to Van Halen, that Paul Gilbert is what 'real guitarists' listen to... So he listens to Paul Gilbert and he's blown away by all that technique. Another expert comes along and snickers... \"Haha, only new guys like Paul Gilbert. Get a load of *Shawn Lane*\" and his head completely explodes from all that technique. \n\n\nAnd there he sits, at the top of the technique ladder, listening to guitarists with technique so fast and flawless, they can do things, technically, that few other guitarists can... and all the 'experts' claim that this is what a good guitarist looks like but after a while, it gets boring. Stale. He misses how he felt when he first started into guitar and the boundaries of 'technique' doesn't give him that. \n\n\nThen, he realizes that 'technique' isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's heavily flogged by know-nothing sideliners and STEMlords but it doesn't really inspire too many emotions... So he goes back to Hendrix and Clapton and only then, does their genius become apparent. \n\n\nTheir genius wasn't in their technique. It was in the sincerity and spontaneity of their expression. \n\n&gt;\"It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.\" - \"\"Pablo Picasso\"\"\n\n\nSo, really, is Bob Ross really 'worse' than some guy who draws photorealistic images of melting clocks or random imagery amalgams of a beefsteak turntable poised perilously atop a rumbling covered wagon? \n\n\nI think Bob Ross rocks **for precisely the art he created**...

She's an amazing gouache artist you might find some inspiration from. Keep painting!\n\nEdit: your more recent drawing looks like a vintage post card. What a cool aesthetic",

But seeing posts like this always remind me that we all start somewhere towards the bottom and gradually get better with time, and it makes me feel a little better and a little more inspired. \n\nOn a side note, anyone out there have any tips or recommendations on how to get started? I know the obvious one is to just draw daily, but any advice is welcome.",

I don't have much experience drawing plants and I tried to get as close as possible from looking at a lot of cedar branches.

Good to know though because I plan on drawing more cedars, and am working on a drawing including some now.",

Just try standing with your upper and lower back sloping away from each other at that angle, you'll break your spine! \n\nAgain, art can be horny and porny and cartoony, not trying to police that. But the anime/ Rob Liefeld style deformed and sexualized posing and modeling doesn't seem to flow well with the mood and overall aesthetic of THIS piece, which would be better with a more naturalistic and less male-gazey female form.",

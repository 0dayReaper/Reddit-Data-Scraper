It's peaceful, it is really good representation of the physics of being on a train...and somehow the fact I stared at it for a minute before realizing there was a piano made it that much cooler.\n\nIt's like the pianist is just as preoccupied as the rest of the riders, but is a little more pensive. It gives the feeling that the riders are just cool with him doing his thing on the piano. It's a casual scene with an oddity that interacts so well that it doesn't effect the peaceful feeling of the rest of the scene if it was missing. In doing so, you've made something typically abstract/strange feel normal. \n\nYou did a great job capturing how the pianist was feeling out his music... I don't need to hear music to know he is feeling out a heartfelt song. I've seen that type of head nodding before to know it as a kind, deep passion for what is being expressed through what is played. ",

    "postText": "\nHello art community,\n\nI'm a children's book illustrator from Brooklyn and I wanted to get into the habit of posting more on my socials and I thought here would be a good place to try.\n\nI'm very anxious when it comes to promoting or marketing myself and I really want to get better at letting publishers know that I'm ready and excited to create for picture books.\n\nI've been agented for 3 years now which is great  but so far I've only worked one book.  So if any illustrators /author illustrators agented or not have any advice on how to get more work with publishers or even indie clients I'd love to know.  Any advice given would be appreciated.\n\nI've been updating my work both on Twitter and Instagram as well as on my website so I have the big 3 covered   I will admit I have been hesitant about sending out postcards to art directors so instead I send emails.\n\nI'm really excited about meeting new artist / art directors and just networking more this year in general.\n\nThank again for all that saw my silly image.",

            "comment": "Looks amazing! I get that; even though art is mainly a hobby for me right now I still wished I knew more about how to market my work to reach a broader audience. My biggest tips for getting the word out is to try finding some more niche subreddits. R/art is a good subreddit but it's definitely harder to get any sort of engagement because there's so many people posting in a day. Finding a subreddit that is active but a smaller community for the type of art you make will make it easier for people to find your stuff. Another tip is to reach out to others first! A lot of my connections I got because I commented on their work first. With businesses, you can email them. As you meet more people, they might tell others about your work and then you have the chance of someone who wants to hire you to find it.\n\nYou definitely have a lot of potential and I'm sure through time you'll find some clients. I wish you good luck on your art journey!",

I really do need to talk more on social media as well, I'm fine with talking to people in person but online I'm usually a little quiet unless I already know the person.\ud83d\ude05",

I didn't join reddit until my friend recommended it to me and it helped me a ton!  I usually only get 10-20 likes on apps like Instagram since it mainly just recommends it to people who already follow you but for reddit since it shows a ton of people ive gotten over 1000 upvotes at one point. Its cause reddit gives everyone in that subreddit an equal opportunity and the same amount of initial impressions and the only advantages is if a ton of people search up your work (which happens to very few redditors anyway) or if you choose a time to post where a ton of people on that subreddit are on.",

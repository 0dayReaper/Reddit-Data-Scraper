There are considerable changes in the lighting on the wall but the boundary between shades stays fixed. This feels a lot like a time-saving technique if working manually. Could also have been added separately, I suppose, and the rest was not similarly \"hand-crafted.\"\n\nIf this is legit, the artist is on another level from most pixel art I've seen. Not surprised a lot of internet detectives are trying to pick it apart.",

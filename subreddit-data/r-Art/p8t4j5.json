It inspired awe and curiosity at the very least.\n\nBeyond that, the fact that this is shows a woman going to great lengths to achieve a perfect appearance in the form of a circle makes me think about beauty standards. I don't know if that's what the artists intent was, but I made the connection. The perfect circle seems unattainable and yet a woman went to the lengths to achieve it, and at the end of the day it was arbitrary.\n\nHope that helps if your question was genuine.",

In fact, now that I'm thinking about it, my thesis doesn't consider any author as dead as it was about the development of witch imagery through the male gaze/men. Also, I really enjoy writing sub-altern criticism in which the author's intent is paramount. I love literary criticism because there are so many ways to approach texts and media!\n\nI was just bringing this particular theory up based on the context of the conversation. Thanks for giving my the opportunity to gush about my other favorite theories, lol :))",

I don't discredit death of the author, I just think often people misinterpret and suggest that's the *only* way to digest literature.  My favorites in school were Keats and Plath, and while it's relevant to remove the context in order to evaluate how well Plath did at conveying her experience, it's also entirely necessary to consider her POV.  And Keats, there is so much tragedy and beauty in the context of a young genius in love, coughing up blood, knowing he won't live to fulfill the potential of his romance or his writing.",

I see the stroke marks on the outter edge of the circle but if you zone out a tiny bit abd look at just the circle, everything in the circle is almost perfect. and the arms are so weirdly posed. It's almost like im looking at an oddity or something I shouldn't.  Like a side show tent from old carnivals.",

Postmodern art would consider this gif to be art.\n\nUnfortunately, postmodernism has changed the bar, not raised it or lowered it, to \"is this 'good' art?\" When anything can be art based on whether or not it is intended to be art, anything can be granted the art tag. Art is no longer a pedigree, but a category. It is no longer a discriminator of what is 'good' vs what is 'base' or what is 'quality' vs what is 'vulgar', but art now means 'is this thing created to be art?'\n\nSo yeah, this is created to be art, it is art, and we can consider it on its artistic merits.\n\nBased on the context that this piece of art was created in, it doesn't appear to be any criticism of current artistic movements, it doesn't appear to extrapolate on any blooming artistic ideas, instead it appears to be someone taking the base motion of a fan, a balloon, and a knife, and attributing artistic merit to it.\n\nSo overall, yes, this is Art, but unfortunately it is barely-novel, boring, intellectually unchallenging, and base Art that doesn't add to the current conversation and instead intends to make a popular spectacle of itself.",

Acknowledging subjective biases and the unlimited versatility of art RAISES the bar of criticism. Your criticism has to be more contextualized, interdisciplinary, self-aware. Even the people who first theorized postmodernism didn\u2019t shy away from criticizing the value of art. Postmodernism isn\u2019t about \u201ceverything\u2019s just an opinion so all that matters is intention.\u201d It\u2019s the exact opposite! Opinions are treated more rigorously than ever. Intention is still important but when has it ever been more important than effect? Let\u2019s stop the pol pot anti-intellectual shit slinging already and read what ACTUAL postmodernists write about postmodernism instead of regurgitating the misleading talking points of bitter reactionaries.",

The medium nowadays is 'art', sculptures, paintings, performances, songs, writings, or any other sorts of tangible methods of communicating an idea. The Message is carried on the medium. It is what the medium is sculpted or crafted to convey to your audience. If your intended message is \"will you go with me to the dance\" and your medium is a scribbled note hastily folded onto a paper airplane hurled at your crush, then that may see greater success than all the ambiguously posed dolls in the world. \n\nCommunication is key. \n\nIf you perform an action and expect a backlash to follow traditional norms, for example, gender norms when responding to a topless woman, and society reacts as expected, then your art can be considered a success. However, you have to tune your message and your medium to your audience.\n\nIf your message and your chosen medium is the critical backlash, then you should have an audience ready to accept that. One great example is Andy Kaufman's tv performance where he performed a fairly mundane act but required that the vertical hold on the transmission be offset such that when viewed from home, average audience members would smack their tv's and adjust the vertical hold while those 'in the know' would laugh their asses off because of that intended side-effect. \n\nAnyway, if your message, medium, and audience overlap is zero, then you have failed. If your audience gets the message via the medium, then your art will be a success. However, if your audience is not a significant minority or a majority, then your personal marker of success may conflict with society's definition of a failure.",

In your example the message conveyed by a note on a paper airplane is fundamentally different than the message conveyed by posed dolls simply by the choice of the medium. Content is secondary to the way in which it is transmitted. Saying \"I love you\" vocally in person versus vocally over the phone versus in a written note handed to someone versus a written text message versus a facebook post versus a youtube versus on a jumbotron, etc, etc will all carry different meanings even if the content is the same simply based on the medium in which it is given. Choosing how you want to express something is as important, if not more important, than in choosing what you want to express. ",

Suddenly,  a car ran a red light.  The car struck a delivery van and went airborne.     The car flipped and landed about 10 feet from me.    I was able to run to a nearby building and had them call the police.   I never heard if anyone was hurt.   But ever sense then, I always have the thought that something menacing is always near, but not always in sight.   This work gives me the same feeling.   ",

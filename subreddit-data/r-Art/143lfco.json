    "postText": "Do my lines look blurry or too pixelated?\n\nI feel like my lines in the middle are too blurry and jagged. Is it noticeable?\n\nIt\u2019s a work in progress and I\u2019m really disappointed with the little character I added in the mouth. It just looks too pixelated. I feel like just covering it up but at the same time I want to keep it but I keep thinking it looks jagged and awkward\n\nDo you think it\u2019s a noticeable flaw or not really a big deal. If I zoom in I can see it all too well..\n\nI was using the syrup brush. I think if I used a bigger canvas I could have avoided this issue with pixels.",

The Ace of Jacks has obtained all the riches in the World!\n\nThe journey has been tough and dangerous, but the Ace of Jacks has pulled through hardships and has overcome all the obstacles.\n\nHe's beaten every Tower, and all his encounters with Chariots, Devils and Temperance has led him to develop a keen sense of awe and wonder.\n\nOnce a Fool, he was determined to learn from the Magician to use his gift for good and for the betterment of the Kingdom. He is all the rage amongst High Priestess'.\n\nThe Ace of Jacks is no \"Hero\". While he has given part of his riches to the poor, he has kept a great horde for himself which he sits proudly upon.\n\nHis ego is his weakness, and his pride is his greatest enemy, yet, the Ace of Jacks has learned a great and valuable lesson from Judgement: all the riches in the world are meaningless if you are alone and have no one to share it with.\n\nPerhaps you can welcome him to a game of chance, wits, or of the minds. A Wheel of Fortune perhaps? He will surely reward you for inviting him to your home.\n\nWho knows, you just might end up on his next great adventure!\"",

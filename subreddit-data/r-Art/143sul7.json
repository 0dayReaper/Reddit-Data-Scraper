This is an experiment with a concept that I don\u2019t think can be perfectly executed by hand on this scale. \n\nI wanted the paper to appear perfectly grey from a distance, and have the creatures only be apparent by the direction of lines rather than any intentional light/dark values, but the spacing between lines is imperfect, so the effect isn\u2019t quite achieved.\n\nI wanted to capture psychedelic hallucinations, what they are like. It\u2019s like you\u2019re perceiving something but not really seeing it, no true overt hallucinations. There, but not there.",

The times when I've stayed up for a really long time it felt like I was surrounded by friends all the time and I was very reluctant to let them go but eventually the body needs sleep. But the anxiety did come across from these guys",

I had a trip last year where I realized that the things I see are just based on what I\u2019m feeling more so than the other way around, since then it hasn\u2019t really bothered me too much. You just have to remember that you\u2019re safe and usually the visuals shift to happier entities. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019ll draw next in this style!\n\nThat\u2019s interesting the way you\u2019re describing the sleep deprivation stuff. I definitely relate to a lot of that kind of thing.",

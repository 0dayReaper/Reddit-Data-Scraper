If I wreck a mountain bike before work I'm going to plop some bigass band-aids on it, not stroll in with a gnarly gloopy mess on my arm mucking up my desktop and notebook.  The women in the office are mostly climbers and band-aids on knees poking out from a skirt is pretty common.  Hell, a VP of sales in a stodgy Forbes 500 I consult for had a damn forehead band-aid the other day.  I think he's into trail running so I figured a branch caught him.\n\nPoint being, I think band-aids are just usually associated with people getting out and having fun.  Grown ups get to do that too :D",

Characterized by casual character interaction, often sort of a romantic explicit or juxtaposed depiction of domesticity. Cartoon characters tend to have persistent designs for recognizability and ease of production, so certain details end up more codified than what they represent. The band aids are a short hand for an active playful person, the kind of person who ends up with random band aids from climbing trees or playing physical games or crafts. A kind of character not everyone might find appealing, but is a convenient kind of character in a slice of life setting because they introduce a level of positive tension breaking chaos. They can make for an interesting character base to follow in an emotional personal stakes kind of story, because they\u2019re likely to be transgressive in a socially well meaning way.\n\nAnd because the band aids are such a broadly reaching kind of imagery present in loads of media all over in a domestic fashion (such as playful kids, teens that get in trouble, etc), it\u2019s a convenient way to go for detail rich designs of characters that don\u2019t get long format stories.",

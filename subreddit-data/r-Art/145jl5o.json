I love the amount of detail and accuracy you have with a fairly minimal amount of strokes. I might use you as an inspiration to pick up the pencil again after many years. Thank you.",

Don\u2019t go to a farm and think you can do that.  We had to install privacy gates and cameras to keep people out of our pastures.  Don\u2019t stop here to do your prom or engagement pictures our cattle are cute but nor tame, they will knock you down and mauled you. \n\nThe Great art it is appreciated and the subject probably raised the cow from a bottle. You did not.",

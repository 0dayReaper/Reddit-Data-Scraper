There is almost a contrast of realities as well. The sculpture looks so cartoon-ish to me, but placing it in that environment along with the lighting brings a very raw, realistic and almost unsettling tone to it all; drawing out the horror from the entangled balloons\n\nWho knew balloons could be used to evoke such feelings, or pay notable homage to this iconic painting \n\nWhat was your approach to the setup and lighting and how did you achieve it if you don't mind sharing your process?\n\nImaginative stuff",

They're being deformed by the internal air pressure, which is maintained by the integrity of the membrane, which is soft thin latex. Every balloon is being supported by its surrounding pieces. You would need something clear that bonds very strongly with the latex, without deteriorating the ability to contain air, that's not heavy, cures very rigid, and is very thin.\n\nIt's kind of beautiful because, like our bodies, it is also cellular in nature. Our bodies are also a large matrix of membranes supported dynamically by internal pressure, but it is living cytoplasm rather than air. If you took a real person and posed them like this, devoid of life, they wouldn't look their best past a week or two either.",

The original was painted on the wall of Goya's home, along with 13 other examples of his more disturbing work. Must have made for fun visits! \n\n2. It's speculation that it represents Saturn eating his son. Goya never gave it a title or represented it that way.",

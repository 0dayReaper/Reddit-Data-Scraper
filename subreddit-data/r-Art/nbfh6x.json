Refrozen brought in and reheated again. It's nutritionally and portionally inadequate. because our health system is underfunded due to boomers who exploited a housing system and fucked the economy. We can't sue doctors for malpractice or anyone for that matter (If I lived in the states I'd literally be a millionaire, instead I'm nearly homeless). So imagine roast chicken so dry and hard it physically hurts to eat. You don't actually digest it either, it clogs you up worse than the opiates do. The veges are so over cooked they're watery cardboard tasting mush. And the only good sandwich is the tuna mayo sandwich, Which still tastes off.",

I do enjoy sketching buildings but that\u2019s easy because I can just draw what I see lol. Creating something from scratch I find challenging, because it\u2019s hard to figure out how certain things behave, in this case, shadows. \nBut like I described earlier, since the leash I higher than the ground it will be less influenced by the dogs shadow. Maybe see if you can reduce the shadow maybe to the midpoint of the leash, or even more so maybe 60% is in the sun and the 40% closer to the dog is in shadow. That might help remove the confusion some people see when looking at it.",

So fetch to them is better because there is a clear job (go get it, bring it back), where as walking to them seems to serve no purpose and after a little while/after going too far they will start to resist and get difficult. Would certainly explain why your corgi likes to play fetch over walking.",

And out of all of those masterful pieces of art that I came across, this is my favourite. The title and the face of the dog are super wholesome! The style is nice too. Awesome work :)",

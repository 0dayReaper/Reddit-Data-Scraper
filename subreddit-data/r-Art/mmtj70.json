If you picture the strip to be a railway, there will only be a single rail but two points of the same rail are connected by the ties. The wheel rides the railway.",

Meaning you can\u2019t tell distance. The loop comes to the front then closes up a bit and then moves through the back loop as the back comes forward and the cycle continues. It looks fucky because there\u2019s no perspective, so the width of the bands stays the same constantly even though it\u2019s moving to and away from you. No weird sorcery is happening it\u2019s just a real possible shape that bends around. Nothing impossible from a 3 dimensional standpoint\n\n&gt;edit. I see now that the wheel part would still be impossible",

So if you walk along the surface, you will transverse the entire surface.\n\nTry pausing the animation. Find one of the grey surfaces (I found them easier to trace than the gold). If you trace that surface, you will end up where you started, making it a loop. The key here is that you did not also transverse every edge. It\u2019s a single closed loop surface and each edge is independently\n traceable from the others. So it\u2019s actually not a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nThis knot is actually able to be made in real life. You can use a ribbon and tie it into the loop in this animation. Choose one side of the ribbon to be oriented \u201cup\u201d. Then pick an edge on the loop in the animation to be \u201cup\u201d and trace it. Again, you\u2019ll have to pause the animation to do so.",

If you fill in the gap (that the wheel sits in) so that it's a solid ribbon, you would get a mobius strip. Or if you approach from the other way, if you traced a line along one edge of a mobius strip, you would find that it would never go underneath itself. If you cut a mobius strip along the middle, you would end up with what is shown in the animation.",

Fix you eyes on any point and you won't see anything impossible in normal 3D. \n\nI think the illusion here is that the rolling and twisting of the track contradicts what we think wooden and metallic structures should do. I'd bet it has natural interpretation as a solid object in 4D space, but a malleable 3D object is also a totally consistent interpretation. Mobius strips are just 3D objects, after all.\n\nEdit: Just looked closer and yup it's not even a mobius strip. The two sides of the track are separated.",

If the website removes the artwork for whatever reason or goes out of business in a few years, you won't be able to access it anymore. Alternative hosting mechanisms such as IPFS require you to host an IPFS node basically forever if you want to guarantee the work remains accessible.\n\nAnd anybody can create as many NFTs pointing to the same artwork as they want. There are many cases of people creating NFTs for other people's work. The buyer has to verify the NFT creator is the original artist and trust that they won't just create more NFTs.",

It's possible that the enthusiasts simply haven't realized there's unlikely to be any long-term value there. But in the case of baseball cards, I can still take out my complete '99 set and flip through it once in a while, or hope that somebody whose rookie card I have will make it into the hall and I'll suddently be $7 richer.",

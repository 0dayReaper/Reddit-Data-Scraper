He used for some of his photos a harness or ropes to suspend himself. \n\nI'll quote a text from an article that says: \n\n\"In his series\u00a0The Struggle to Right Oneself, Skarbakka can be seen falling off balconies, down stairs, off bridges and through windows. It\u2019s enough to make you go weak at the knees, though spare a thought for his girlfriend and sometimes even strangers passing by, who are the ones taking the actual shot. \u201cI ask people: \u2018Can you press the shutter when I look most compromised?\u2019 which often gets a weird reaction.\"\n\nThankfully, in many of the photographs Skarbakka is wearing a harness or suspending himself with ropes, and the worst injury he has sustained is a broken rib. In some of the images he didn\u2019t even try to jump, but instead leaned just far enough so it looked as if there was no going back.\"\n\nSource: https://www.phaidon.com/agenda/photography/articles/2013/january/24/the-accidental-art-of-kerry-skarbakka/",

Probably 7/10 pain from all my breaks, but it causes really uncomfortable and prolonged pain for days just from breathing. Not like a comminuted or oblique displaced fracture that puts you into shock almost immediately. (Shock kills. Take deep breaths. Stay calm.)\n\nSo it depends on your psyche a bit for how bad you'll feel it is. Some people I know think rib breaks are the worst because of how long the pain is intrusive for, like while trying to sleep or rest.\n\nI'd much prefer a boxer's fracture or most other avulsion fractures to a rib being broken, but most of my other breaks were worse than the ribs by a long way.",

BUT, said by a clumsy guy, not a pro athelete.\n\nHalf are sporting injuries. Martial arts, snowboarding, mountain biking, baseball. The other half are mostly from two crashes, one car one motorcycle. (0% fault for both, was a passenger in the car.)\n\nAnd one outlier is from being too drunk and too over worked at a company Christmas party.\n\nMy number one bit of advice: get a good physio therapist who knows athletic injuries. You have to push through the pain and be diligent with the stretching and exercises if you want as much strength and range of motion back to the injury sight as possible.\n\nAlso, eat lots extra and drink lots of water for the recovery. Your body can't use resources it doesn't have to put you back together.",

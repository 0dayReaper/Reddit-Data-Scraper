Your worth isn\u2019t dictated by your weight and certainly not by strangers on the internet. After all, your mind and body create such moving works of art.

I know it\u2019s cliche and I didn\u2019t feel like it either when I was in those deep holes. But dude, I was 6ft 255 pounds. Started riding bike 4 miles round trip. Up to 5, went to 7,10, 13....  it gets easier and easier and you feel better and better every day. Endorphins and rest of brain chemistry starts humming, your mental health gets better than it\u2019s been in years, your metabolism is awake, you sleep like a log, and feel great when you wake up. I was pissed this weekend that I HAD to rest my legs and forced myself 2 days off. Woke up this morning at 4:30 and showered, stretched (very important for us out of shape peeps to stretch) and was on bike at 5:11. Rode 14 miles into Washington DC and back by 8 am. For 27.5 total miles, I have so much energy after shower and feel great today!!\n\nTry rowing, biking, hiking, running/walking, anything outside!! But still keep painting even after you kicked the shit out of the depression!!\n\nYou can do it homie..",

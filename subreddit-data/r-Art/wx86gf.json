Imagine watching ab animal walking walking through tall grass for example. You would not see it as several slices of antilope but as one antilope moving behind grass. That is just one example of grouping.\n\nThis picture makes us group objects and constantly alerts the brain, that it has to reevaluate due to a previous error. (And the brain doesn't like that. It ideally wants to sucessfully solve some easy but not too easy tasks constantly. That's why WE feel funny watching the picture.)\n\nFor further reading I recommend \"the emerging mind\" by Ranachandran. It's a bit older but still sets the foundation for the relatively young field of neueoaesthetics. Most newer stuff is very Specialized and hard to grasp without a background in neurology and/or empirical cultural studies.",

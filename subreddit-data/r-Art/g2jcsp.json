Roman army surgeons were insanely skilled, and practiced basically a very modern approach - they tried different combinations of everything they brought from all over Rome, and they had meetings, notes, shared knowledge - basically they were the best in the field. \n\nSome of that knowledge survived well into Dark Ages and to the plagues... The problem was, nobody really knew how to cure plagues. So, every time an outbreak happened, actual doctors, together with many nobles, would just nope into the countryside, leaving everyone else behind. And the city officials would often hire anyone willing to say that he's a doctor. \n\n Or, in the words of Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague\\_doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor)\n\nTypically, they (Plague Doctors) were not experienced physicians or [surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon) at all; rather they were often either second-rate doctors unable to otherwise run a successful medical practice or young physicians seeking to establish themselves in the industry.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#cite_note-FOOTNOTECipolla197765-1) They rarely cured their patients; rather, they served to record a count of the number of people contaminated for demographic purposes.\n\nPlague doctors by [their covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor_contract) treated plague patients and were known as municipal or \"community plague doctors\", whereas \"general practitioners\" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#cite_note-FOOTNOTECipolla197765-1)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#cite_note-4)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#cite_note-Byrne169-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#cite_note-6) In [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) and the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands), plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as \"[empirics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism)\". In one case, a plague doctor had been a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#cite_note-Byrne170-7)",

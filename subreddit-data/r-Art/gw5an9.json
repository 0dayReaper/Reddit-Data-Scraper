I don\u2019t know, but I do - much like I have more faith in our society than I have in a long time. \n\nThere was another post in r/pics a few days ago that stopped me dead in my tracks and just made me sad and yet hopeful at the same time (https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/gt62em/i_created_a_painting_based_on_the_recent_events/).\n\nThis picture has evoked a similar, yet different reaction. It\u2019s powerful more for its sheer creativity and design than for making me sad. It\u2019s so so so powerful. \n\nA perhaps subtle message: folks are willing to blow it all up to get justice for others. People from all over the world are being so selfless with their protests. It really shows the solidarity between the common person. \n\nI hope that powerful pictures like this, coupled with world-wide protests, help those elected officials to finally see the systematic issues we have in this country. And if not, I hope it will inspire the next generation of leaders.",

Night on the town, out drunk joking around, suddenly there is a car coming at you as you cross the road.... It's loud, it's bright, then it's all gone. Everything is quiet ... Something that never happens when being in town... And everyone is gone. The feeling of being drunk is gone. You can hear the wind, feel the air... And hear the buzz of a neon sign. Several feet away from where you were hit, you see exactly what appears in this image. The neon buzz is coming from the hovering words and is the only man-made sound you can hear.\n\nYou begin to wander around, and examining the world around you. Everything is as it was, but emptier and much more clean and organized. The cars won't start, electronics won't work... And you can't help but shake the feeling that there is nothing left to do....\n\nEdit: was asked to continue it, did so:\n\nYou begin to walk further away from the place that you died. Exploring, looking for anything and anyone that is alive or could give you some information about where you are... What you are. Though you can tell many hours have passed- enough that it would be morning by now- it still remains dark, with everything caught in twilight of clear summer night. Nothing seems out of place... But nothing else seems to be around either. Nothing moves but what the wind encourages.\n\nIt's beautiful. But the emptiness and calm are quickly becoming drowned out by the intensity of everything that is missing... The evermore loud sensation that this is all as it is everywhere else, no matter how far you could go. The only thing different, the only thing abnormal enough among all of this that could explain what was going on lied beneath neon lettering that read, \"The End. Thanks for playing\" at the very place your journey began... and ended. It is a dark call with single answer. So you turn back, down the roads you've walked, the streets you've seen, to arrive at the place with answers.\n\nIt is as you left it. The only remarkable thing left on these unremarkable streets. A stones throw from a pub, in middle of your average old road, in just another town. What a place for it to end... It is ending, right? Something... Certainly ended here.\n\nYou stood and stared. Questioned if it was to be ceremonious. The neon buzzed on. You stepped forward. It happened almost the same way you arrived...in that it was quick. But instead, this time it was dark and quiet. \n\nAnd then, just for a moment you slipped back into a familiar world. Somewhere, off to your side, there was a voice. \"Aye, mate\" it said, heavy and dark with sadness. Then, cynically and drunkenly slurred out, \"but that's life...\" And then you were gone.\n\nEdit: Guys, thank you for all the love on this! I really appreciate it. For those of you who inquired, I'm not actually a publisher writer... But it's on my to do list. Atm I'm a college student fighting his way through. I don't often find myself with good enough inspiration to write like this, so it was joy for me to write too. Developing the discipline for writing is something I work on as I can...but don't often have the time for. All of the feedback is an encouragement though :)",

Its a long story but by the end they manage to make their way to a heavenly existence. But they also realize over the course of whats probably thousands of years that eternity loses its allure since humanity often defines ourselves by what we do with our limited time. So they decide that there is a doorway that they can walk through that disperses their souls across the cosmos once they feel at peace with ending their existence. Its just small natural archway made out of tree roots but in essence it is the same idea as the image here. Walking through \"into\" the end.",

Everything outside of the room I was in had faded away and I was sinking into the feeling of ancientness, as if I were a forest allowing my leaves to die for winter, not knowing if spring would come. \n\nThen things changed. And I was \u201creborn\u201d so to speak. And it made me feel as though I had at one point been every mythological figure of greatness in history. Hercules, Zeus, Odin. Those kind. And showed me how much I had been failing myself and those around me in life, and how much potential was inside of me to be the man that I can be. It gave me the courage to rely on faith and take some leaps that I\u2019d been avoiding. \n\nIt can be a bit daunting but they have been a very very introspective experience for me and the things I experienced that first time will stick with me forever. I\u2019d give them a try.",

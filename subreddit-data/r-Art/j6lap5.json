That'll do a number on your feet and sciatic nerve any day.\n\nOn a reflective note, it's funny how a manicure or pedicure can really uplift your spirits if you are sad. I had a pedi last month, and I almost started crying in the chair because it's been so long since somebody just soothingly touched me. (If you're a macho man, they have pedicures for men too. They'll get off all your skaggy calluses and trim your toenails. Your feet will be as smooth as a baby's ass.)",

And before one can start painting, they must apply a layer of some sort of primer, then wait till it dried up, then sand it down and add another layer of the primer, wait till it's dry, sand it down and do that again and once again. Four times in total and it takes about a week for even a very small panel which are common for icons.\n\nAt least that's how I was taught and how everyone else in uni does that, but idk if OP does the same. Without all the layers of primer it's gonna chip much faster and bend, plus, the wood will get soaked in the oil and will become a much worse fire hazard.",

I had been making my own oil paints (im not exactly a painter yet) and during tests, all I could find to paint upon was cardboard. The paint loses its oil because it soaks in to the cardboard, and that is when I learned that primer was a must.\n\nI also just acquired original Bob Ross liquid white (not in the new plastic containers, but in the old metal tin) and that itself isn't even a substitute for a primer. The paint is just a thinned down titanium white that Bob Ross used in his wet on wet process. Primer is a must, but I need to ask, do I strictly need to use a white gesso as primer?",

From what I understand now the primer just has to provide a barrier to the oil. I am really enjoying myself making and experimenting with paint. I bought the historical pigment set and the paint making starter set off naturalpigments website, followed by some gum arabic and walnut oil. I am now making both oil and watercolor paint. Ive been able to dabble more with the watercolor paint because it's slightly more accessible (no paint thinner or primer is needed) but I have to say, the color difference between the pigments in both oil and watercolor format is massively disparate.\n\nThe historical paint set came with a small amount of lapis lazuli pigment (og ultramarine) and it's beautiful as a watercolor, but as an oil paint, there is no comparison to the color. It's the most deep blue ive ever seen, and such a pleasure to mix with other colors. After messing around with all these pigments and binders I understand a lot more about paint in general, it's just pigment + binder and the binder could be anything depending on the type of paint you are making. It really only takes a short amount of time and almost no resources (after initial purchase) to make a respectable paint (properties of the the pigment providing.) You can make enough oil paint to cover an entire panel (20x25cm) with just a few drops of oil and less than a gram of pigment. The final product depends on the initial fineness of the pigment (grainy/gritty pigments dislike becoming paint) and the duration of mulling.\n\nI really really enjoy making the paint, and cannot wait to actually make some creations of my own.\n\nFor the time being, I am only using historically available and natural pigments, and plan to eventually move on to other pigments such as synthetic pigments.\n\nI appreciate your reply, it was very helpful.",

It's a mess because paint is kind of hard to scrape out of a bowl shaped surface, rather a sanded glass plate is preferred but I have seen people use the rough side of a marble cutting board or a cheap floor tile from a home improvement store.\n\nI personally use a glass pane that is roughly 1 square foot in dimension and sanded rough on one side to give it a frosted texture, and then a muller which is used as a pestle to grind/disperse the pigment throughout the binder. A muller is just a glass almost teardrop shaped tool with a flat and sanded bottom, but anything with a rough and flat bottom works, lets say something like the bottom of a thrift store vase works well depending on the size/type of vase you find.\n\nThe pigment generally is the fineness you want it to be in the final paint product to begin with, the mulling process is much less about grinding the pigment, and more about dispersing the pigment in to the binder and getting every particle coated in binder on all sides. Depending on the pigment you might not have to mull very long. Some pigments have an affinity for being mixed, whereas some are just stubborn and dont want to cooperate. There are colors like Payne's grey and other multi pigment colors that need to be mulled for a longer time. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWZMAPOHWLA\n\nShe begins mulling around 4 minutes.",

You can however use acrylic gesso, which dries much faster than an oil based primer. It holds up fine to an oil painting ontop. Additionally with an acrylic primer, you can begin the painting in acrylic for an underpainting and then finish it in oil. It speeds up the process a lot at the sacrifice of some surface quality. I've hand built a ton of 5-6 ft wood panels over the years for oil painting this way and the surfaces have held up. With MDF you have to be really careful with the edges though.",

One of these techniques is the use of egg tempera, pre dating oil painting, which requires a stiff base because it's prone to cracking.\n\nAnother technique which was common in the late Renaissance, especially Italian, was the mastery of chiaroscuro, basically the rendering of light to define form. In the 1500s Christian painters would begin with a wood panel and give it a glass-smooth white base coat. Next they would apply oil paint, and use rags and brushes to wipe away the paint, allowing the white of the undercoating to come through. The idea being that they were revealing God's light. The painter would not use or add any white paint again after the undercoat is complete, as if the undercoating is God and man should not wield the light himself.\n\nThis technique works much better on a very smooth surface as opposed to rougher linen or cotton canvas. It's a process and technique I use myself despite not being Christian, as I find the historical connection and end result unique + beautiful. Plus because you can't use any white in the painting at all but have to rely on the base coat, the process requires working in layers and managing your oil to pigment ratios rather carefully which can be fun.\n\nWhat's also interesting to me is the reversal of this technique and way of thinking when we move to the 1600s and look at Baroque painters like Carravagio, who used tons of shadow and painted with light, rather than \"revealing\" it.",

The primer has to stick somewhere to be painted on. And then again, some people don't put on as much primer onto the wood, making the texture of the wood visible as OP. And one of the best things about painting on wood panels is that if the artist completed the painting on the panel and suddenly decides that something is missing, they can add another panel and continue painting on that, i.e. Rubens did that almost always because the panels had standard sizes which (ofc) weren't big enough for him.",

Gesso stick!  Becomes one with the surface it is applied to, and accepts a wide ranges of  mediums as well. This is the purpose of any primer/paint/ surface combination on a house. Problem with wood panels are that they will absorb moisture and with one side painted, it will change the way wood will absorb moisture.... it is prone to warping. Then longevity... cotton lasts a long time. Note  the wrappings on mummies while wood objects crumble. Line e is even more archival. . And tension can be adjusted on canvas. Then there are insects... some art on surfaces less than ideal disintegrate,  while panels are removed from behind paintings and transferred. Not that most painting will ever be this value able in a thousand years to bother with. You can apply gesso to slate, other rocks, anything. It can be tinted. \n\nThe oil being referred to can linseed oil, or walnut, several others, even egg yolk ( egg tempura) they are called the medium...pigments are ground and a paste is made with the medium. Pigments are expensive, rare and sometimes dangerous/ poisonous, and some colors are very expensive.  The color needs to be stable... ie it won\u2019t change over time or after being exposed to the UV in light. Mixing paint was a full time job for some masters apprentices or the artists themselves. Some colors so valuable array that they were reserved for very special paintings/subjects/patrons.",

Sure, I read Sunstone because I enjoyed the exploration of BDSM not solely because of its erotic content, but I would never recommend it to someone wanting to read a compelling story about interpersonal communication. It is porn. \n\nTell me, if the interesting interplay of shadow and light were explored on a clothed woman sitting in a chair do you think this would be front page material? This is explicitly sexually provocative in the same way a dick pic is.",

Adding clothing would do nothing to remedy its lack of popularity, although it might have less downvotes from the prudes. Would clothes add something for you? Would it make this painting better? Why?\n\nI'd say it's quite different from a dick pic in that one is photography and another is not. It's more akin to a painting of a dick, and even that is a stretch because no genitals are visible in this piece. It's like a painting of a man in a sexy pose if you wanted to compare something. It's maybe like Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, but with a different skill level. That painting was also considered immoral and was banned at the time, but is now considered great art. It seems the only difference between \"porn\" and great erotic art is the amount of time passed since creation and viewing.",

            "comment": "Rhyolite was a small bustling town in Nevada during the gold and silver rush. After the mines in the town closed down, the people left and nature took over. Over time, buildings were torn down and succumbed to nature. All that is left now in this national park is just the ruins and memories of what once was.\n\nShot on large format 4x5 provia 100, this was a multi hour exposure. You can see the star trails as the earth slowly turns. The far away lights of Las Vegas light up the very distant sky to a deep orange. And a single sodium vapor light, about a half mile away, lights up the pillars, giving them their green glow.\n\nThis and other works can be seen here: https://art.anamorph.photo/",

THIS. \n\nI just wanted to say for anyone who related to this, that I was painting about quite a difficult period of depression. What worked for me was seeing someone about it. It's difficult to explain everything through words, so I paint. I know that seeing other people go through difficult times makes us feel less alone, and that helps short-term, but I have to say that trying to get out of it is worthwhile, and it is possible. \n\nMeanwhile, I am still figuring out how this website works, and I am Overwhelmed with all the kind responses.. wow... such an unexpected welcome. thank you.",

Its absolutely stunning.  Your technique and ability is fantastic, but your ability to capture the emotion in this painting is absolutely top notch in my opinion.  \n\nYou're extremely talented.

A girl I once dated told me to read The Bell Jar. I found it surprisingly triggering. If you\u2019re struggling with depression I suggest one of my all time favorites, The Elegance\ufffc of the Hedgehog.

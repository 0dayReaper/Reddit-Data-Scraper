I would guess it has two light sources. Blue directly into the liquid (maybe from the side) and then red from above. Then they pass something over and through the liquid to cause the wrinkles and shadows which make this all so psychedelic looking. That\u2019s my speculation anyway. Would love to hear others thoughts considering I couldn\u2019t look away once I saw it haha",

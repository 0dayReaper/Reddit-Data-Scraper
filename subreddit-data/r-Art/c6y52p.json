They do not do so during the day because it is too hot and there for if they did they will lose a lot of their moisture from transpiration once their pores open.

Trees help add o2 to the atmosphere, and then essentially trap co2 inside. As a tree decomposes it releases that stored co2 back into the atmosphere. There is massive amounts of co2 locked under the ground (millions of years of dead plants/animals that were buried). That is the issue with burning fossil fuels, you are taking a shitton of co2 that was safely tucked away underground and releasing it into the air, which throws off the natural balance. That is one reason there are so many tree planting iniatives across the world, they are great at removing co2 from the air. They also are essential for biodiversity, temperature regulation, and overall just are pleasing to look at.\n\nMore trees = more o2 = less co2 in the air. When the tree dies it will release that co2 (unless it's like buried super far underground and trapped), but more trees will grow in it's place, balancing it out.",

It is always either the Earth's temperature is cyclical, and we don't have enough recorded data to prove otherwise, or they do chalk it up to carbon emissions, but US and other Western nation's are a drop in the pond next to Chinese/Indian emissions, and thus don't feel the burden needs to be on them.  \n\nThe first point is argued that even in the short term, there is a very clear uptick in temperature from when the industrial revolution began, so human involvement appears to be at least a contributing factor.\n\nThe second point, at least from a US perspective, is that despite China/India having much higher carbon emissions, US citizens by far per capita have higher carbon emissions.  It's like a fat guy arguing that because he eats less than the other 4 roommates, he is a lesser contributor to the overall problem of the fridge being empty.  Only in the scenario, the solution to that argument would be to get rid of a few other roommates to let his argument hold value, whereas on a global scale, you are essentially saying to get rid of millions of Chinese people...\n\nI always get angry at everyone who argues FOR climate change, but then says we should replace with expensive/inefficient solar.  \n\nSolar is great, but it is a passive energy supplement, and doesn't eliminate coal due to no way to store energy for surge demands or nighttime use on a central level.  \n\nModern nuclear plants are safe/clean, and currently proven to work to eliminate coal NOW, not \"eventually\" when we figure out the storage problem.  Unfortunately, everyone loves a good \"catastrophe\" story and constantly spreads misinformation about the safety of nuclear power plants.  THOSE are the people that should be the direction of anger, since they are taking a obvious solution to the problem at hand and smearing it with scare tactics.  One might even say... \"Fake news\".  \n\nWatching the latest \"Chernobyl\" series just made me so irritated seeing that the passive viewer likely will be pushed away from nuclear, despite the plant that this happened to was very poorly designed, and plant designs that have existed since before the turn of the century have been able to avoid a meltdown even when all of the active safety measures were shut down.  \n\n/rant",

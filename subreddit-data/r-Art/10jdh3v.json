Even games that are often claimed to be peak of game writing, eg Mass Effect, have writing that is nowhere near to what's considered the peak of writing in other artistic fields (especially from artistic, not entertainment, perspective). Disco Elysium showcased that contrast within the same medium, even if it's obviously still not equal to eg peak literature. Ofc that doesn't mean Mass Effect is bad. Nor doe that mean there aren't other games with writing comparable to Disco Elysium, but it's an extremely rare thing.",

You just want games to replace books by the sound of it.\n\n\nMass Effect is arguably a much better game than Disco Elysium to a lot of people, and it's fundamentally MORE of a game than Disco Elysium many would argue.\n\n\nWhat Disco did is focus less on gameplay/gaming and more on story, which is why the story is good. He stripped away 90% of mechanics of what makes something a video game, and kept the bare minimum that allows someone to interact with the world. It doesn't make it better, it's rare because it's BARELY a game. That doesn't make it a better game. It's just a hybrid that is really well balanced in a way that book lovers will enjoy, and someone who really enjoys gameplay, will hate.\n\n\n\nIt's just a super weird comparison, akin to saying choose-your-adventure books are better than regular books because no other book has given the user as much CHOICE as ever before. That's not the point of a book. And purely having the 'best writing' isn't at all what a game is about and is not the objective metric for it. Because - and Disco proves this - when you fixate on a single thing so much, lots of other shit falls to the wayside, which is fine, but it doesn't make it better.",

Even with good story focused indies however, the style of writing often reminds me more of short film or short story kind of writing, exploring one interesting idea or evoking simpler emotions in a great way, but not really tackling a more complex and diverse set of topics, from multiple angles, in the way you might find in feature film or even a novel. Again, even that isn't bad, but it's way more common. \n\nI don't think this is an issue of recent era or anything, it is becoming better over time (Planescape Torment being notable exception), because it mainly stems from games not being taken seriously as a full out artistic medium, but just . Not just by lots of consumers, but often also the creators. It's like there's lack of artistic ambition. \n\nIn case it seems my only criterion for something being an \"artistic\" game is writing/story, it's not. In addition to eg Obra Dinn, Outer Wilds (not Worlds) is IMO one of the artistic peaks of gaming, and while the story/lore/plot there is actually pretty good (at times mindblowing), it's mostly note-based and often takes backseat in favor of gameplay, exploration, and just experiencing the world. But just because I think world needs more Outer Wilds, which is pretty different from DE, that doesn't mean I also can't think the world needs more Disco Elysium.\n\nI also take opposition to stance DE being basically book and tabletop glued together and similar sorts of arguments. It fully utilizes the aspects of its medium for its goal, which means that some aspects are more pronounced, as they compliment the game being made, while others are less utilized, but the medium as a whole is still fundamental to what DE is.",

It's now nearly fully voiced, which *really* helps if you're someone who doesn't enjoy reading a ton of text.  \n\nYou explore the world and you have skill checks, which are based off your skills.  Some you can retry after leveling up the skill, some are one-time checks and what happens happens. Your skills are basically just voices in your head that will chime up when appropriate (or, at inappropriate times as well).  \n\nThere's not really fighting.  You're just playing an amnesiac, alcoholic cop and how you build and play the character helps guide the story.  The supporting characters are great and the music/art style is fantastic. \n\nIt may not be for everyone, but it's easily one of my favorite games.",

Best accidental purchase ever. I was just trying to feed my anime addiction but got some tripped-out philosophical shit and learned how to lucid dream. I will say that the clips of Alex Jones raging like a psycho didn't age the best, but at that time he hadn't gone hard-right as is clear now. Mf joined his own sworn enemies, the fool. Richard Linklater directed both of those, as well as School of Rock and Dazed and Confused. All great stoner and/or trip movies.\n\nOther excellent surreal animation: Dead Leaves, Cat Soup, Redline, Tekkonkinkreet, Animatrix, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Mind Game, Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Paprika, and I see Love, Death, and Robots are listed here already.",

We have so many problems of our own making because we have our priorities all fucked.Even, for example, all the retail cashiers, we can automate those jobs but why should that be bad? We should be having more people working the same jobs for less hours for the same pay, instead under capitalism and private ownership all that increased productivity goes to a single owning entity. Success under capitalism is essentially defined as who can squeeze the most profit out of the least labor without regard to the human or environmental cost.

Older generations finding something to complain about in the younger. I like to remind myself to not blame them personally. \n\nI personally would also like to return to my childhood, but really that's only because my parents did such a good job keeping me from seeing all the crap going on around me. Mind you, my childhood was in East LA in the 90s, so there was a *lot* of crap going on. My parents taught me to avoid groups of guys wearing the same colors or sports jerseys, and to avoid the guys drinking \"apple juice\" in the park, and to only take certain streets on my way to school and back home. I never knew why, I never *understood* why. If the violence and racial discrimination and chaos hadn't been so thoroughly covered by the news that I can easily look back - and so impactful that the anniversaries of events like the Rodney King riots get covered in the news - it would probably be really hard for me to see it without the rose-tinted glasses.\n\nAnd, as always, a fun quote to remember:\n\n&gt; If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.\n\n\u2013 Plato, complaining about this newfangled thing called \"books\"",

This is a meaning that has shifted because of the original painting.\n\nEdit: American Gothic is a good example of \u201cdeath of the artist\u201d in that Grant Wood\u2019s intentions have been lost over time, especially after thousands of parodies. He may have been inspired when he saw a rinky dink farmhouse with a classic gothic style window, but that fact isn\u2019t what gave the painting its power in the public consciousness. Although if I could have made a suggestion to Vasquez, I might have suggested he use the general shape of the background more prominently, maybe a splash of mud on the back window that evokes a Gothic church window.",

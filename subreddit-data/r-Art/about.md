Description:

This is a subreddit about art, where we are serious about art and artists, and discussing art in a mature, substantive way. *Read the rules* and observe other submissions before posting. Be on your best behavior and do not comment unless you have something meaningful and mature to say. We are strictly moderated and do not give out warnings.

Rules:

Use correct title formatting: [READ THE FULL RULES BEFORE POSTING OR COMMENTING!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/wiki/index)

Artwork - Title, Artist/Your username, Medium, Year

Use your reddit username as the artist name, or a real name/unique nickname.  **FOLLOW THIS FORMAT PRECISELY!**

Example: The Night Watch, Rembrandt, Oils, 1642

News article - Title, Year

If your work is a copy, **cite your sources!**.  Tag your work NSFW where appropriate.

Direct Image/Video Links Only: All submissions other than articles must be a direct link to a static image or gif (url must end in .jpg, .png, .gif etc.).  The most reliable way to do this is to upload the image directly to Reddit.

Articles must contain more substance than just a gallery of images or an embedded video, and they must cover some current news in the art world. 

Images should only contain 1 art piece.

Do Not Make Multiple Posts: You must wait at least 48 hours between posts, although no more than twice per week is better. 
Excessive posts/comments will be considered spam and result in a ban.

Please use rolling stickies for daily challenges or special threads.

Do Not Submit Sketches or Doodles: Post these to other subreddits like /r/IDAP, /r/sketches and /r/doodles instead. If it's an unfinished work and you need advice,  instead try /r/learnart or one of the dedicated subs like /r/painting .  

Remember you want your art to look clean and polished.  Sometimes all you need is to take a better picture, or crop the picture to remove distracting elements, or enhance the contrast.

Do not Submit Work With Extraneous Objects: Just the art and nothing but the art, as if it was on display in a museum or gallery -- e.g., don't include yourself, your tools, your hands, your pets, your plants, or even a source photo.  Let the art stand on its own merits.

Present your work like you really want to show it off in the best possible light.  Take a good picture.  Use neutral backgrounds.   Frame it perfectly.  And so on.

Do Not Post Memes or Low Quality Work: This rule is totally up to mod discretion.  Deliberately low-effort posts will get you banned.   Show that you care about presenting your artwork by taking a good photo and enhancing the contrast &amp; color balance.  Make your best first impression.

If you're not sure what you're posting is OK, message us to ask first.

No Fanart, Comics, or Requests: See here: https://old.reddit.com/r/art/wiki/fan_art

Ignoring this rule may get you banned.  If you're unsure, post to a more suitable subreddit like /r/fanart, /r/artporn, or /r/comics. 

Submit requests for art work to /r/designjobs .  Posting them here will get you banned.

Be Respectful and Stay on Topic: [READ THE FULL RULES BEFORE COMMENTING FFS!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/wiki/index)

**We are a strictly moderated sub and do not give out warnings.** Talk about the posted art and only the posted art.  Bigotry, slapfights, creepy *whatever*, off-topic rants, or really anything that would be inappropriate in an art class, will not be tolerated and will get you banned.   

If you're unsure, **don't comment**.   Use the vote buttons and move on, or message us for clarification.

No Blogs/Social Media/Stores/Spam/Self-Promo: /r/art is not a place to sell your work or grow your following. Consider /r/artstore. This applies to comments _and_ submissions. It applies to watermarks on images.  It applies to almost *anything* even remotely "spammy".  

If someone asks about buying your art, direct message them back.  Do not comment.

Turtles are Friends, Not Food: Looking for the name of an artist or any info about a work of art?  Try /r/WhatIsThisPainting 

Plagiarism is grounds for a permaban.   If you copied someone else's art, including photographs, **link to your source in a top-level comment.**  No exceptions; no warnings.

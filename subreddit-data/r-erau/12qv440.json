    "postText": "Looking to join embry in daytona for fall 2024 for an aerospace engineering major in astronautics\n\nAre there any high school class requirements before going in? I have an AP in lit/comp, a few honors, etc., but read that I might need a calculus, trig, and a physics class to be accepted. Is this true, even if the high school doesn\u2019t offer it? Also, what would be the likelihood of being accepted with a 3.8 unweighted gpa, and a few extracurriculars in competitive speech, ffa, band, etc.? Should I try to improve or is this about average?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the application process requires either (essay, ACT/SAT?) so any info on that would be helpful as well",

AP physics counts for 113 which is the physics for non engineers and you have to take calc ab and bc which won\u2019t count towards the right calc classes needed for the degree. TL;DR: Don\u2019t take ap physics or calc because you will still have to take those classes here",

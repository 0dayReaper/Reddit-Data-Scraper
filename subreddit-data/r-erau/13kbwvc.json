    "postText": "I'm a sophomore in high school and I'm expecting to graduate with an Associates degress in Liberal Arts without any costs. I've been thinking of becoming an Air Traffic Controller and I saw that ERAU has a program for it; but, I technically don't need a degree to be an ATC, so is it really worth it? \n\nI'll most likely take a few more college classes where I'm currently at (looking at a degree in Mathematics or Business) before going to Florida so I can save as much time and money as possible. I was thinking that I would apply to the Daytona campus and go into the ATC program, but if I didn't like it, I could into Aviation Business Administration as a Plan B. \n\nIs this a good plan? Please let me know.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a good plan, like you asked in your last part of your post. However, think about the options you have\u2026. \n\nERAU is a name. It\u2019s extremely expensive. I took classes online with them paid for by the military, so I haven\u2019t paid a dime. I looked into the actual tuition for their actual campuses. It\u2019s way too expensive, considering you don\u2019t actually need a degree for ATC. \n\nIf you want to go the college route, by all means - do it. You will get an ATC job regardless. There are cheaper ways\u2026 the FAA even had a program (they may still have it) where you apply to go through training with the FAA for ATC. After that training I\u2019m so so certain you\u2019d get a job. They are/were offering this because they are in desperate need for ATC.\n\nYou could join the USAF for 4 years and be ATC\u2026 you\u2019ll get training, certifications, and experience while getting paid. Sure, you won\u2019t be making as much as someone who is out of whatever college program or whatever they did, but they\u2019ll be around 22 years old anyway when they apply to these jobs right? After 4 years in the military you\u2019ll have zero debt, savings, GI bill, a security clearance, ATC experience (aka salary negotiation leverage) and you\u2019d also be 22. And you\u2019d have experience as a federal employee. Guess who\u2019s getting the job? Out of the college grad or military vet, most likely the military vet. The other guy will prob get hired somewhere too but not with the same salary as the vet. Just something to think about. \n\n\nAlso: this is from the FAA website:\n\nhttps://www.faa.gov/be-atc\n\np.s. \n\nLook on usajobs.gov and see how much money ATC people are paid\u2026 that could be you!\n\nEdit: after looking into the FAA program I say absolutely do NOT go into debt with any college if this program is literally going to pay you to learn ATC at FAAs academy in OKC and the other option of the military is essentially the same except better money and benefits quicker. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go into unnecessary debt, just to work for a company and slowly pay off that debt that I never actually needed anyway!!! Get paid to learn, save your money and invest!!!\u201d- future parkeriscool_ (I swear that this is actually what you would say to yourself.)",

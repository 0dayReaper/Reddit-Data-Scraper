I\u2019m already working within the aviation industry and wondering if/how you\u2019ve benefited from this program and any feedback or advice you have.",

            "comment": "The thing about an HF degree is that your success is determined entirely by how much extracurricular effort you put into getting published, attending conferences, and specializing in an area of research. \n\nLots of people see it as the \"easy\" alternative to engineering and just waste their time and money. If you don't do any of that then you're not going to find a job worth a damn.\n\nMyself and a couple of my colleagues started up the VR lab back when Oculus first came out using one of the school's grant programs, and are now working in that field. \n\nIF you want to stay specifically within commercial aviation, you're basically shoehorned into a safety specialization. UI design is oversaturated, but safety and error prevention is a huge market and the biggest within aviation by far.",

I work as a systems engineer so I do wish I would\u2019ve gone the systems engineering route but at the time I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be where I am now. Overall I really enjoyed the ERAU program and learned a lot which helps me in my position now. I have a great job and make great money. So I can\u2019t complain.",

It seems like many airport jobs now are leaning heavy into IE to guide process improvements and technology. I\u2019m debating doing IE with a focus in Human Factors but the courses here seem to better align with the industry than an engineering school/program.",

I made sure to network with other professional students and create relationships with faculty. I was able to integrate systems engineering studies into a lot of my curricula which helped for my particular application of HF. I would say choose a thesis or capstone option depending on what the program requirements are now days.",

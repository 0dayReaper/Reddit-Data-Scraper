    "postText": "Update: Dr. Madler sent an email clarifying that we will get new wind tunnel and prop labs before the old ones are removed. \n\nAccording to a professor at the Prescott campus, who wishes to remain unnamed, the school is planning on tearing down the current wind tunnel and propulsion labs to replace it with a fancy new student union (since apparently the old labs can't be expanded). Evidently the plan is that construction will not start on a new wind tunnel building until AFTER the student union is finished, and demolition is scheduled to start next semester. That means a MINIMUM of 2 years without any wind tunnel or prop labs. The professor was very displeased with this idea, but his complaints were ignored, so he asked that we share the information so we can try to convince the school not to move forward with this plan.  \n\nOne of the main reasons I chose Embry-Riddle over other universities was for the opportunity to gain hands on experience, and I'm sure the same is true for many other people. I know the current labs are old (and apparently have received OSHA violations) and I understand the want to replace them, but I'm sure there is a better solution. Especially one that prioritizes educational facilities over a new club house. \n\nIf you could share this with your friends, especially those who would be directly effected by this plan, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nDisclaimer: The professor did not speak with me directly, I am simply relaying this information.",

I\u2019m also pretty sure the old building was in violation of some fire codes because there wasn\u2019t a single sprinkler in the entire eating area, both the main section and the back section.",

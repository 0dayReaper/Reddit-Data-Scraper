A surface pro with 16 gigs of ram and an i7 will end up being about the same price as a laptop and ipad but combines the best of the laptop with the best of the iPad.",

And now with the ability to download the MATLAB, Catia and other software to the desktop it\u2019s just not my fav imo. I was fortunate to get a book scholarship through the school for my iPad but even then just paper notes there\u2019s nothing wrong w them and an iPad + comp can be significantly less than the surface. It\u2019s just a bad compromise between the 2 for a surface imo",

            "comment": "Unlike the other amazing comments here, I'll give a legit answer. \n\nWindows definitely, some CAD softwares don't have mac versions. At least 1 TB, these days hopefully you can get it as SSD. 8 or 16 RAM. i5 at least, ideally i7 if you can afford, i still see no real need for i9 even today. Some form of graphics; integrated vs dedicated is up to you. Integrated should be fine for what you'll have to do. Only big issue with dedicated is you get into that \"gaming computer\" realm where everything gets very big and heavy and annoying to lug around.\nIn terms of $, for 1k you should be able to get a very nice device with everything you need to get through the degree + a few years.\n\nI myself prefer Dell, inspiron series is decent. If you can afford and are ok with the size, alienwares are good too.\n\nE: also highly recommend getting an external monitor, but at first, there's no need to splurge on it. My first one was some crappy hand me down in college and it served very well. Also, please don't get a Surface Pro.",

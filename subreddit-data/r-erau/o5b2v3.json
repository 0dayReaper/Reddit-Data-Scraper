There was one guy who got 95% of his commercial done and his instructor left. He got put on waiting for a year and a half and quit going to Riddle. The amount of time people have to wait is atrocious. They should make flight instructors sign contracts to stay for a set amount of year or years.\n\nEdit:\nAlso two of my friends were instructors and have sat through instructor meetings and some of the things they would say about the students would make you drop out and go to another school. They told me some of the stuff when I went there and it is the most toxic environment they had ever experienced in their flying experience. I don't have exact quotes anymore it was 2 years ago but if I did it would seriously make you reconsider. I switch programs but if I was still a flight student when they told me that stuff I would have immidiatly switched.\n\nEdit 2: I have another story too bad to share here. If you are interested PM me. It has to do with a CFI student.",

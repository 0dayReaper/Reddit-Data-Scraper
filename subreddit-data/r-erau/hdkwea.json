    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI am a senior about to graduate this fall.  I have often felt like us world wide students are not supported by faculty outside of the professors.  Most WW profs are adjunct, meaning the don't teach at a campus and are not in tenured positions.\nI had a course with Gary Ford and he was a mess so I called him out on it.  He was on a power trip and talking to him made things worse.  I reached out to the student services and got a response after a few days where they said it was all just a miscommunication.  I was so frustrated because no one was on my side, I had to shut up and just do my best while ignoring the rude feedback on my assignments.  I ended up getting an A in his course.  Here comes the course critique and I just said exactly what happened and gave him negative feedback.\nDays after the grades were submitted I get this nasty email from him saying all these things and referencing my feedback, which should be anonymous. (I can post screenshot if y'all want me to).  \nI contact student services again, send them the email and they said action would be taken immediately and they apologized.  I believe he got fired, and rightfully so.  I believe there is a lack of oversight for the adjunct WW professors compared to attending on campus.\nTLDR: prof was a dick, student services didn't do anything about it, he became a huge dick and student services supported me and I think he got fired.\n\nAnyone else have an experience like this?",

To my knowledge, it\u2019s very uncommon for this sort of thing to happen, and it\u2019s good that he\u2019s been disciplined appropriately.",

One guy, who somehow had a PhD, just replied to everyone with the same sentence, \u201cGreat job ThePfhor, where will we be in twenty years with this technology?\u201d You can be I also called him out in the survey, but I did not get any negative feedback like you did. This is for the Master\u2019s in Entrepreneurship program, so I would have expected the teachers to be better...I guess not. I did just watch that Patriot Act on Colleges the other day and how adjunct Professors can be barely paid at all, and this is becoming the norm.\n\nThank god my GI BIll is covering this because I would be pissed if I had to pay out of pocket. I can\u2019t wait to graduate in December.",

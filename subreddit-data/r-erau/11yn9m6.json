    "postText": "Does anyone know if you choose your engineering specialty in the engineering bachelors worldwide campus? For example, I want to focus on mechanical engineering, but the core courses consist of classes from electrical, civil, aerospace, etc. Which means i\u2019ll have to take classes from all of the engineering disciplines. Is this basically a jack of all trades engineering degree? \n\nI\u2019ve asked the pre admissions advisors and they want me to pay money for the application, and then ask the academic advisor. I just don\u2019t have the money for that at the moment.",

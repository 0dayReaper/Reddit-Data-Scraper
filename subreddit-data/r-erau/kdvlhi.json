    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nHope you're having a great break!\n\nI'd like to hit you all up with a question. This past semester was kinda rough being online (even partially). And one of the things I was concerned about being online was cheating. This is an important issue for **everyone** but it's a delicate one too. I am interested in doing a survey of some randomly chosen ERAU students to get a better understanding of the issue.\n\nSo what I would like to ask you is: *If you were asked to take a survey on whether you ever cheated on an online exam at ERAU (and if so, how you cheated) that was GUARANTEED to be anonymous, would you participate?\"*\n\n(You can read the description of how the survey is designed to be anonymous in the comments below.) Thank you!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kdvlhi)",

                    "comment": "That's a good question. So when you do a research project on human subjects at a University, first you have to go through a review process via an organization at Embry-Riddle known as the institutional research board or IRB.\n\nAnd the key issue in such a survey is that you preserve the anonymity of the students. This is absolutely paramount to any sort of study like this if you want to protect the student and you want honest responses\n\nSo you would administer the survey at the start of the class with the permission of the instructor (because you are right, online surveys, no matter what they say, are never anonymous plus you always get much better response rates with in person surveys). You would make it very clear that participation was voluntary. You would put the surveys inside of identical manilla envelopes (one for each student) along  with a number 2 pencil (so no student could be identified based on their writing instrument). The entire survey would ONLY be checked boxes (so no one's handwriting could be identified). There would be a section for students to answer if they had never cheated (so no student could  be identified based on the time it took them to do the survey). Afterwards the student would put the survey inside of the opaque envelope along with a pencil, seal the envelope, and put it in a bag (so no student could be identified based on what order they turned in their survey).\n\n All of this would be explained to the students when the survey was to be given. It's part of the informed consent process that's required by the IRB",

I found the classes through WW to be excellent and challenging. I don\u2019t remember well enough to give you specifics, but they seemed to be mostly structured in a way that basically eliminates the ability/need to cheat. In other words, it was more difficult to cheat than it was to just learn the material. If I ever had the money to spend, I would absolutely consider doing a Masters program through the WW campus. \n\nI was just thinking that if you teach a class that is also available through the WW campus, they might have some ideas that could help you.

It's all over the map. People don't really have a handle on the issue. My sense is that in some classes it's probably pretty high. But the problem is that the people that you know are in a specific major and taking specific class and so they might not be representative of the University. If students at the lower level class are cheating that's important because we need to address that. If a student somehow gets by in introductory physics or calculus and they really didn't learn the material they're gonna eventually fail out AE anyhow. They're not doing themselves any favors  And it ends up affecting everybody.",

Look at all the people in business and politics who act unethically to selfishly benefit their own interests. Do you want to live it in a future with those sorts of people? Do you want to have business dealings with them and trust them?\n\n\n* Even if the material is not important (and I don't think that's a statement that you can make for everyone by any stretch), but even if you believe that, what you still have to realize is that in your intro technical classes you're learning how to think about quantitative matters carefully. You're developing quantitative thinking skills. So for example you may never integrate again but when you encounter a new technical problem as an engineer, you know how to break it down and analyze it, you know how to think about it correctly and carefully.\n\n* You argue that there's material you learn that you're not gonna use so it doesn't matter if you cheat on it. But how do you know what material you won't use later on when you're a freshman or a sophomore? How do you know as a mechanical engineer you're not going to need chemistry? There are a lot of mechanical engineers (like in biomechanical engineering) that do have to know a fair amount of chemistry to understand how molecular receptors work, how to design biological substrates, along with understanding thermodynamics, flow rates, reaction yields and things of that nature. The world is changing so much right now that even if you talk to your friends and they're not using something, it doesn't mean you're not going to have to use it. Look at computing. Quantum computing is probably going to become a reality in the next decade and your generation may have to learn a whole new skill set.  If you go into  College with the mindset that you already know what you need to know, you have a very narrow view. College is supposed to broaden your horizons and opportunities and a good college education should not only teach you what you need to know for your field but it should prepare you for the future and introduce you to a lot of connections and ideas that you never even imagined when you started.  I take myself as a good example. I started off college as pre med. Hated physics, couldn't understand it. Said to myself when am I ever going to use a freaking frictionless pulley? Then one day I went to try to find a quiet room to study and and I opened the door of some lecture Hall and a guy was getting ready to give a talk. I felt so embarrassed that I walked in and sat down. The guy was Howard Berg a biophysicist from Harvard. And he explained the physics of how bacteria move with flagella. And my eyes totally opened. I understood what good torque, restoring force and all those \"boring physics things I was never going to use\" in the context of something that I loved and it totally changed my whole life. I practically took only physics and mathematics the rest of my degree program.  \n\n* And even if it's not about the material it's still about the person having the ability to do the work. A person who cheats because they're unable to learn introductory physics is probably going to get weeded out. Are we really doing them any favors by letting them cheat, spend all that extra tuition money and then find out in their 2nd or 3rd year they have to change majors?\n\n\n\nThere is no universe where cheating is either ethnically good, logically sound, or beneficial to anybody",

Problems that refer back to material covered in class on a timed test are *very* difficult to get help on using tutors or online resources.\n\nBut the second strategy, trying to deter cheating by making the exam harder, seems very unsound. It violates a very basic principle that educators try to follow: *never let your concerns about the minority of students cause you to create a policy that burdens of the majority of the students*. First, it vitiates the whole purpose of the exam, second, it actually encourages cheating, and third, it penalizes students  who don't cheat. Where I come from, this is what we call \"pretzel logic\".\n\nWhat's the solution? It's hard to say. The more you centralize rules about testing, the more you take the power out of the profs hands to devise good tests. On the other hand, with no oversight, you get situations like your AE.  I would like to think that a student should feel free to go to a professor and discuss these sorts of issues with them. But I don't know how realistic that notion is.",

We tried discussing the difficulties, but a fair discussion without comparison to other professors is hard and honestly not good for anyone. Though that class highlights the bad, another class (AE 414) did a fantastic job of making the tests online, fair, and uncheatable. They referred to course material and homework which, of course, helped on the test, but were changed enough that it wasn\u2019t enough to get you a good grade so you had to actually know your stuff from the classes. In addition, rocket propulsion can get deep enough where Google/chegg is just useless. For us in the higher level classes it works... okay.

Imagine a question which would be impossible to answer based on the information presented in class and in the textbook (like a statically indeterminate question in a statics class, or a diffi Q problem without initial conditions) and \"leaking\" a false answer/method to that question beforehand. Then, if you saw the leaked answer or approach on the impossible question, it would imply that the student had access to the leaked information.

I've seen a lot of professors make accusations about cheating in classes that statistically can't be justified. One of the best ones is a professor at University of Florida who accused students of cheating on a take home exam (its on YouTube). It was really kind of a baseless sort of accusation because you don't know which students cheated and which ones just did well and just because a student improves doesn't necessarily tell you that they cheated. And when it comes to trying to judge the similarity between 2 solutions, that is **incredibly** difficult to prove and if a person were to take that to honor court, it's almost certain that the professor would lose. Sadly these types of accusations are all too common, because even professors often don't understand one important fact about statistics: *it can tell you a great deal about a population, but very little about the individual*.",

Some of my professors never explicitly said on their syllabus (or verbally) that they were against students gathering to take an exam, or using class materials. \n\n\u2022 Poorly advertised or nonexistent mental health resources.\n\n\u2022 SOME professors failing to provide students with adequate online delivery. \n\n\u2022 Office hours being poorly advertised or severely restricted. \n\n\u2022 Tutoring being outsourced to online strangers. I found Riddle\u2019s old tutoring program to be far more beneficial than this online mess the university has paid for. I preferred being guided and helped by a student who once had the same professor, and understood the professor\u2019s style and content.

I'm always amazed at how much they know about planes and have a lot of respect for them. I appreciate everyone being so candid and honest, and I hope it does some good.",

This completely locks down your computer so you can't have tabs open and the only tab open is the test. Obviously there are ways people can skirt around it but I'm more intrigued as why it wasn't mandated in the courses that were going to be online as to at least curtail some ways of cheating.",

For engineers and others working on projects governed by ITAR, NDAs, and Secuirty Clearances, allowing that level of remote access and control on student owned device borders a legal grey area that no one wants to play in due the federal laws involved.",

                    "comment": "I don't recall the details but the lockdown browser has issues with certain programs that students have to use in some classes and there are also some compatibility issues with certain browsers,  IIRC. These programs also add an extra cost to the students. And as you suggested, there are myriad ways that students can get around it anyhow. At this point as far as I know the lockdown browser is really on the back burner and I'm not aware of anyone who uses it at ERAU.\n\n As far as why more preemptive measures weren't taken, I can't tell you. Many of those decisions are made at the top administrative levels regarding the sort of educational materials and products that the instructors and professors are told to use. Large educational companies like Pearson and McMillan appeal to the admins because they provide uniformity in course content and delivery. But their assessments  are also very easy to cheat on. So there's a trade off from their point of view. But the upshot of their decisions is that a lot of our ability to design exams that would be resistant to cheating is out of our hands of the profs and there's little we can do about it.",

Written exams (open notes) with personally-made questions makes it so the answers aren\u2019t found online, and limits it so the only way students can cheat is by working together (which is something I don\u2019t believe can be avoided with online situations)",

Five minutes after the online exam opened up, the questions appeared on chegg.\n\nI'm not saying that there aren't ways to reduce cheating but the reality of online exams is the simple fact that the professor generally cannot directly proctor the students.  Also with many of the online courses, professors do not have the liberty of making up their own exams. They are told that they have to use assessments from online educational companies like Pearson and McMillan. So the situation is much more complex than it appears and there really is a need to understand it better.",

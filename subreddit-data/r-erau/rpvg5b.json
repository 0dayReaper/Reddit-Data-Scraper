I double minored (Business Administration and Air Traffic Management) and discovered new passions I didn\u2019t know I had. Now I am going for an MBA in Airline Management thanks to this degree. You still have to work for it though like any other degree, it\u2019s just more interesting since you can choose the classes that mostly interest you.",

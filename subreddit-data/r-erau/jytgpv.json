Felt like most of the labs were essentially spending a couple hours with a breadboard to make some excel plots that showed us what we already saw in the lectures. Kinematics labs provide a visual, real-world representation of the concepts taught in class. Circuits don't really lend themselves to such transparency, so the labs end up being more conceptual than practical. Labs be a better use of time if they were focused on practical circuits and the process of designing them rather than just building basic circuits that have already been analyzed conceptually.",

On the same token, I learned a lot more about electrical systems in my first job than I did in college. But, I feel that holds true for most topics. I'm a firm believer that a degree teaches the fundamentals. But your job will mold you into the your of engineer they need.",

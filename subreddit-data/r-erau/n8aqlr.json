    "postText": "**No, We're not going to convince you.**\n\nWe're all butthurt because the recruiters, tour guides, &amp; administration all seemed to care until we paid our first tuition. They brag about campus life, the pretty buildings, and the food. If you come here just for that, you'll probably hate this place. Practically everyone on campus feels like the upper administration only does things that save face or attract new students. You can spend days waiting for some campus staff to respond to your email just so you can get something you're owed.\n\nThat being said, even though we're paying enough to the university that admin should care, at least we didn't get scammed into going to some liberal arts sociology basket weaving degree. **If you can graduate from this pain-in-the-butt school**, you'll have a good shot at a well-paying job. For some people it that promise of a good job, I suspect most of AE it's just part of some sadomasochistic ritual, and for others it might just be the fun of a challenge. What ever it is that makes people stay, clearly we are not butthurt enough to leave.\n\nThere is a magical part of riddle: somewhere in this mixture of sausage fest and antisocial behavior is a glorious moment when a plane flies overhead or a rover lands on mars and for a brief moment you're tricked into believing the debt is worth it. Just at that moment you'll get an email from canvas from your boomer professor saying the assignment you thought you had until Friday to complete is due tonight. But there are only those short moments that truly keep us here. It's something nearly impossible to describe without experiencing it first hand.\n\nMaybe some pictures will help explain:\n\n[20 year old boys geeking out over water flowing through a series of precision manufactured holes](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNQugkqhXY3/)\n\n[Nerds who wanted to go to med-school but thought engineering was easier driving around a miniature ambulance](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMQy8LgBk0e/)\n\n[Plane spotters spending hours just to catch a photo that will get them jet photos clout ](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqBOQ0HFeLZ/)\n\n[Engineers watching a car they built go around in circles repeatedly](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAbi6o0h-nd/)\n\nThere are differing cliques and caveats associated with the subgroups you'll find at Riddle, but at the end of the day it's about you finding something that you are passionate about. The complaints you hear about parking, the gym, the dorms, and the food are all getting at the deeper issue that ERAU's admin isn't paying attention to what makes them special and is just trying to cast as wide a net as possible, not caring about how many incoming freshmen they alienate.\n\n**TL;DR - ERAU isn't what it's advertised as.**\n\n**Just to get some FAQs out of the way:**\n\n* ERAU will accept most people with a 3.5 GPA, &amp; 1100 / 22 (SAT / ACT). this is pretty much the standard unless you're in a more competitive program. Even then, ERAU has like a 70% acceptance rate *(see whole rant above on alienating freshmen)*. The hard part isn't getting in, but staying in.\n* No ERAU isn't a party school, *unless you think engineers staying up late talking about thermo is a party*. Frats are decent, but they're not like [Ohio State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEr1NXjcp7M).\n* Transfer credits are a pain, it's a lot easier if you check with your recruiter/records and get it in writing that your credits will be accepted. [*Peep transfer credit portal*](https://erau.transfer.degree/app/#!/my/transfer/credits/major/)\n* Do well on the placement tests, they actually matter. But typically they're not that hard for people.\n* If you're uncertain about your major there is time to switch but probably you should make that decision before the end of your second semester. [*Peep the course catalog*](https://nextcatalog.erau.edu/)\n* If you leave your dorm room you'll make friends. *Consider joining a club if you're worried about that.*\n* The residence hall you stay in doesn't really matter. They're all crap in their own special ways, but typically follow the price structure. You can always switch out rooms if you don't like it or your roommate. HRL even has a week called room swap week.\n\nHope this helps.",

Would you say this is why their are tons of turnover on students, or is it the difficulty, or a mix of both?",

In my time at Prescott I'd say the first reason I saw people leave was their grades, the second money, and then multiple people I know left to be closer to home, to change schools for scholastic reasons (probably not worth riddle tuition for many if you decide engineering/flight isn't for you), and to change schools for social reasons (there's not a ton of partying, its nerdy as fuck, and the gender ratio is bad). \n\nI loved my time at Riddle but I wish it cost me less. I'm in a great position in my field and loving it. If I wanted a more traditional college experience it would have bene less work to seek it out at another university, but parties and dumb shenanigans still happen at every school.",

I thought I was bitter lol, but this...\n\nI for one do enjoy being here. I didn\u2019t go to riddle because of career chances primarily. If you look around honors you\u2019ll find a lot of people who had acceptances to more big-name universities but chose riddle because of one reason or another. And as evident by the fact that a lot of them are still here, not everyone seems to hate it as much as you do.\n\nI\u2019m not a recruiter, and it\u2019s not my life goal to convince people to go to riddle. But if someone asks for it, I\u2019ll tell them why I went. Because go f\u2019ing figure, that actually helps people form an image of the school. And since I enjoy my time here, it\u2019ll be largely positive (with the general tone of \u201cit\u2019s definitely not for everyone, but if you like these things, it might be for you\u201d). If your experience is that negative, that\u2019s cool. But don\u2019t pretend like you speak for everyone.\n\nThe FAQ is good. Speak for yourself regarding the rest of the post",

If anything at ERAU (Prescott) at least, faculty cared more about me than they did as a grad student at a large state school. I'd had multiple opportunities to speak with deans and dept heads at Riddle about issues I had over my 4 years. I had a major clerical error as a grad student and had a college had tell me to kindly fuck off and not make the same degree sinking error in the future (luckily the professor teaching the course had sympathy). \n\nRiddle's largest downside for me was that it's expensive as fuck. I had scholarship money but still needed loans and thanks to being a grad student for a while that money sat collecting interest while I couldn't/didn't need to make payments. It being expensive should ABSOLUTELY be a part of consideration for going to ERAU but that's not unique to the school and people should really examine that better than they are equipped to at 18 years old.",

Riddle was advertised to me mainly on the grounds of being heavily geared towards anything space or flight, and classes being small (allowing for more personal interaction with professors).\n\nPeople who say \u201cconvince me\u201d generally want to hear why you went and why you stayed. People ask these questions *precisely because* we as students/alumni often give answers that are different to those of recruiters. We are a massively valuable resource to incoming students.\n\nWhen people say \u201cconvince me\u201d they want you to list what you perceive to be the positives, so that they can draft a picture from a bunch of second hand experience. So is it ethical to state why we went to this school and why we stayed? Abso-fucking-lutely. Asking \u201cwhy should I go here\u201d is often easier than asking \u201cwhat are the positives and negatives about going here\u201d, because the latter will often get people just shitting all over any given school or university. People *generally* want to know the positives about each place, because if people just have their \u201clemme shit over my school\u201d rant to them then every school is garbage and just not doing university almost seems attractive. \n\nYour words are super generic dislikes that people have about near every school or university. Food is bad, they just want your paychecks, administration often has problems and working with them is tedious, and so forth. That gives *noone* any actually useful info about riddle, since that\u2019s what people use to shit on every school. Hence it can be *much* more useful to provide the positives of why you are here.\n\nOf course there\u2019s things that I dislike about riddle as well. The ISSS doesn\u2019t tend to be very helpful, and some professors have been hated by generations of students and still have a job. The second one again kind of is true for most schools, but I\u2019d be happy to list good and bad professors to actually provide useful info. But what is an incoming freshman gonna do with the info that Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics (6th semester class) is gonna suck because the professor is very meh? They\u2019ll forget that by the time they reach that class. \n\nMakes much more sense for me to tell them that I went to riddle because most people here are space nerds, the professors actually remember my name and face for the most part if I talk to them, and I\u2019m not a party person so a non-party school is perfect for me. Did I list any negatives? No. But is that statement still representative of why I am at riddle and why I\u2019d recommend it to other people that might think similarly to me? Absolutely. I don\u2019t see the ethical violation",

There are elitists and there is STEM toxicity here. There are creeps and socially awkward folks. There are cliques and parking problems and bad food and so on. That will be the case at any other university though. Our problems are not unique. It seems more pronounced here because we are smaller, but if you hustle and associate with the right people, YOU WILL BE FINE.",

Most of my friends are going to different colleges so that's ok. \n\nThis is best case scenario for me.",

Only count on policies and rules that are actively in effect today. From what I can see of the numbers, unless there is some massive change in the circumstances, which seems very unlikely, there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll be able to safely have in-person classes.",

You are still guaranteed a space within ERAU housing, we just don\u2019t know where that will be yet.\"\n\nThis worries me because the word \"guarantee\" doesn't seem to mean much to the school during all this seeing as we were also \"guaranteed\" to be able to finish the last spring semester from our dorms and my room assignment was also a \"guarantee\". The last time we ran out of housing they were cramming three people into rooms designed for two. I don't want that, especially cause it would make social distancing impossible.",

They are taking examples from other schools and replicating them into something that would pretty much be our own place. From what I know, they are taking examples from the other schools and did it in a way that isn\u2019t so rash as the others. If Texas A and M, which is one of the biggest student populace universities is still having in person classes, and they are in the top 6 states of having the Most Covid Cases, we are more than likely to keep to in-person classes.  People are basically panicking too much on wtf Riddle is doing and calling Riddle Stupid in regards to their decisions, but you compare them to what other schools did such as find a flight within the next 24 hours even though you\u2019re an international student, we got the better end of things. \n\nFor summer B, the students who are currently living on Campus right now are the guinea pigs whether or not we are able to do in person classes and so far, it is going very smoothly. I assure you, that even the professors and people who work on campus want In person classes because even us on the school working side hated online and working from home. Let\u2019s just say it was a bitch to do. \n\nSo TLDR: We are more than likely to have in person classes rather to have another online semester. No one is prepared for it except for the Worldwide professors which is basically their job. Have some faith. It\u2019s just a waiting game now.\n\nEdit: Don\u2019t quote me on this but students may be mandated to take a Covid testing before arriving on Campus",

Florida and to a lesser extent Arizona are becoming hotspots, in Florida's case its as bad as NY at its peak. \n\nBut the school will continue to say everything is fine, nothing to see here.\n\nThe greatest hope of going fully online [at least for Daytona] is a hurricane coming close or striking Daytona. A decent chunk of the student body is going to evacuate which leads to an inherent risk of COVID infection and some will go home to states that have travel restrictions on Florida. Unless the school wants the students to violate quarantines to return, they'll probably call the semester there.",

Anybody that's taking off their mask in class or refusing to wear their mask in class, it's in violation of the Honor Code--carries the same weight as cheating and can get you kicked out of class and/or school. They're gonna be taking that seriously. I think they've done as much or more than anyone could do to prepare for fall semester. If there's an outbreak, then we'll see. I hope people are careful and take it seriously. I do not want to go back to online if we can avoid it. Face to face is so much better than online.",

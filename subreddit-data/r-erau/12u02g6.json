    "postText": "Hey, y\u2019all!\n\nI am currently a senior who has essentially finished the college process and is now on the final step of actually choosing a college.\n\nI am deciding between Embry Riddle Daytona and UNC Chapel Hill. I am a bit at a standstill.\n\nI was thinking of possibly going into computer science and both schools offer the major (Embry also offers software engineering). I don\u2019t know how accurate my info is but I have heard Embry Riddle is more hands on and UNC is a bit more theoretical with CS. I, however, do not know if I can thrive in CS. I have always loved computers and I have taken multiple CS classes in high school that I enjoyed. I also enjoy math. UNC offers more options in terms of majors but Embry is specialized. \n\nI have visited both campuses and I have enjoyed both. Embry definitely feels a bit more intimate (probably since there is a small student population) while UNC feels less so. \n\nBoth schools have essentially offered me the same amount of aid. UNC gave me financial aid for the year while Embry has offered a scholarship that will span 4 years (if I keep up grades). Both will cost me around $20000 a year. \n\nI also have a best friend going to Embry. We met our first year of highschool and we have been through a lot. I genuinely feel like they are a friend for life and I really care about this person. They have also expressed an interest to go to the same school together. Part of me loves the thought of going to school with them and going through the process of growing together while being there for each other. \n\nI know, however, that UNC offers a lot. It is kind of uncharted territory and I will be going to Scotland for my first semester because of the Global Launch Program.\n\n\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",

            "comment": "Embry-Riddle is generally an aviation focused place so if that's not a concern, your choice kind of comes down to if you want the smaller school experience with the perk of having a friend there or if you're a better fit for the bigger university. Which type of school will you take advantage of the perks?\n\nUNC will have more academic and social activities but ERAU will have better access to professors and the limited opportunities.",

            "comment": "if you aren't doing aviation I feel like UNC is the place to go - much broader experience as well of course -  big school sports activities, cultural/arts  opportunities, classes outside your major,  and is a very well regarded school that will offer a lot more diverse experience  vs. ERAU - but it can also have big school challenges.   So much can depend on roommate, first year experience, dorm mates, etc.  Embry can be a great place if the fit is right - but might be a bit more niche - especially if you're not doing aviation.\n\nYour friendship might flourish if each of you go off and develop at your own schools - then you can road trip, catch up over breaks, and meet eachother's friends.  Hell you could even do a summer school at eachoter's institution.  Good luck.",

Distance between the Lehman building, CoB, and CoAS isn\u2019t that bad, can easily be done in 10 minutes. Don\u2019t have a class right before your AF 101, you will need extra time to get across the bridge. Don\u2019t be afraid of T/Th classes, or after 5pm classes. I honestly prefer them, but use ratemyprofessor to choose which classes to take. Especially for your EGR/CHM classes you will want a good prof. Good luck!",

Also this looks like an AE schedule, so I HIGHLY recommend reconsidering doing MA 143 and placing in calc 1. It\u2019ll set you back and if you don\u2019t want to do summers it\u2019ll be pretty much required. I graduated in 4.5 in AE because of a situation similarly so keep in mind. Many do 5 because of the same. Really though, this schedule is nuts and not reasonable because I too did an epic schedule with ROTC my freshman year and promptly said fuck you to my grades because of this. Your best positive is not having EGR 120 and 115 together because many struggle to do both since they\u2019re your first introduction to engineering methods in programming/computers.",

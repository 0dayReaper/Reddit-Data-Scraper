My personal guess it that we will me back in the fall, but may be sent home around Thanksgiving break due to a predicted increase in virus cases in the winter. Whatever happens, we'll probably find out 2 weeks before school starts in true Riddle fashion.",

As they are bigger (at least talking about PC) I would wager we will be on campus by then as well.  How long that lasts is a different question.  With how fast this thing spreads I will be amazed if we make it to thanksgiving.  I half expect an email one weekend.",

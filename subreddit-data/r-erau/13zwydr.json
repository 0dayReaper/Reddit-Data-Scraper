    "postText": "Mostly did calculus and physics courses previously that used Pearson\u2019s. Pearson\u2019s will walk you through every problem and give unlimited tries on homework. Wiley laughs at you and offers you a hint that may as well be a riddle designed to confuse you even more. Wiley only gives 3 chances on homework. And then to add insult it\u2019s just giving the correct answer and doesn\u2019t explain the process of how the answer was found. \u201c-118 degrees, use a vector capable calculator\u201d\nIt\u2019s lecture videos are only short clips about general ideas and are not helpful for solving anything. After a week into this class I\u2019m seriously concerned because it only just started and I\u2019m at a 50% in this class.",

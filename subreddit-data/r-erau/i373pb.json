There is a mandatory temperature check at the entrance of the building, and masks are required indoors.\n\nOnline courses are not a perfect substitution for in-person, but there's nothing they can really do.\n\nThat said, I'll be really mad if I have to pay full price for a parking sticker this semester.",

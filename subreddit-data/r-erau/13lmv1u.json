My time at Riddle is an amusing anecdote I tell in interviews but hasn't affected my career in the slightest. \n\nI will say the $150k student loans have driven me to aggressively increase my salary to get out from under this debt. I am more than half way through and should be done in 2 years.\n\nThe degree is not worth debt under any circumstances. If paying for it isn't a concern then go for it, it's a great school and my pilot friends make slightly less than I do but have a better view.",

    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe information that the University has been sending out regarding the weekly updates for the virus do not do the best job of showing the week to week progressions of testing and new cases.  I recently created a tracker that I will be updating as ERAU releases their weekly testing results that displays all of the information they have been giving us, as well as information such as the number of new cases, the number of new tests, and the number of new Sentinel tests.  The link to this spreadsheet is [**here**](https://myerauedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/whiteb15_my_erau_edu/EeCPT610YgFKmuWjvHcpVLkBinqtfYh3nVCmUuOr_9d_fg?e=mcxbWf).  This is located on the ERAU one drive, so you will need to log into Ernie to be able to view it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe testing numbers for each week are highlighted in yellow.  The number of new tests, new Sentinel tests, new cases, and active cases have all been highlighted in blue so you can see the week-to-week progression.  The number of new tests, new Sentinel tests, new cases, and active cases for the current week are highlighted in green so they stand out better.  Both this spreadsheet and post will be updated on a weekly basis when I get time to put the new data in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe results for the current week are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Daytona Beach Campus**\n\n162 Tests this week - 2,465 Total Tests\n\n173 Sentinel tests this week - 511 Total Sentinel tests\n\n5 New confirmed cases - 47 Total cases\n\n42 Individuals cleared to resume activities - 5 active cases/under isolation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Prescott Campus**\n\n63 Tests this week - 1,302 Total Tests\n\n19 Sentinel tests this week - 54 Total Sentinel tests\n\n3 New confirmed cases - 34 Total cases\n\n30 Individuals cleared to resume activities - 4 active cases/under isolation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Worldwide Campus**\n\n0 New confirmed cases - 4 Total cases\n\n4 Individuals cleared to resume activities - 0 active cases/under isolation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWear a mask.  Follow the guidelines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**Link to tracker for those who missed it.**](https://myerauedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/whiteb15_my_erau_edu/EeCPT610YgFKmuWjvHcpVLkBinqtfYh3nVCmUuOr_9d_fg?e=mcxbWf)",

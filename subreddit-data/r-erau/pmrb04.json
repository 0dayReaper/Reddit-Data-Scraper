As I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019ve noticed the Prescott ERAU campus has essentially blacked out\u2026it\u2019s currently 4:50 AM and all lights - I mean all - are out, security systems are alarming, and to be honest it\u2019s a little eerie. I went to my bathroom to go, well use it, and found the light wouldn\u2019t turn on. Then upon further investigation, I found the campus inside and outside is completely dark. Looking on the ah BRIGHT side of things (get it?) the stars are quite beautiful\u2026Anyway, hope you fellow Riddlers are doing well and are hopefully powered.   Sincerely,  A Prescott ERAU Student",

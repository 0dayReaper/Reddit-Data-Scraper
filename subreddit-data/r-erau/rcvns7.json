Students need to be allowed to defend themselves on campus. Luckily for everyone it seems like he wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.",

So if that was your point, then I agree. But the whole issue of would be shooters being able to access guns capable of mass murder too easily will not be solved by throwing more guns at the problem.",

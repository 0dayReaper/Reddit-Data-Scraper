Now that it\u2019s finished, I\u2019m here to reveal that I\u2019ve completed an Embry Riddle community Minecraft server! The server is open to all, but is geared towards Embry Riddle students across all campuses. Please share it around!\n\nIP: 54.39.68.56:25596\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/ryscw7G",

I can get really good server space for free and I already own the domain erauMC.com. I have custom websites i made that render out overview maps and give player statistics and everything is pretty much ready to go.",

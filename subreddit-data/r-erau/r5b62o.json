However, whenever I hear about Embry-Riddle's aviation programs I always hear a very mixed review from people. So, I was wondering is it worth attending ERAU for its AS program?",

ERAU will give you some connections and there are internship programs available. But I don't believe they are worth the difference in cost between doing state school + a local FBO vs ERAU. If you go the state school route try and do your flight stuff with a part 141 operator vs a part 61, you'll save money in the long run.",

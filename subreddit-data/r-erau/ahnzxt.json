We're reaching out during this difficult time to let you know that we care.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Embry-Riddle Alumni Network leaders and Worldwide Campuses are organizing EaglesCare gatherings in communities across the country. You and your family are invited to join the larger Eagle family for free pizza and fellowship. We hope you can connect with fellow Eagles at these events and grow your support network. \n\nPlease check the listings to see if there is an EaglesCare gathering near you. If we don't already have an event planned in your area, and you are aware of Eagles from your organization or in your community who may be affected, please contact the Office of Alumni Engagement. We may be able to assist.\n\nWe care and fellow Eagles care.

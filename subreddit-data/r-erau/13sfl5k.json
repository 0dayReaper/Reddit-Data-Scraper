    "postText": "Anyone have any recommendations for decent, off campus apartments for DB campus? I have a 30lb dog and will need a 1bed 1bath or studio. In unit washer/dryer with a balcony or patio for my dog would also be great\n\nI\u2019m looking at Coastline Cove and maybe Andros right now, however Andros seems a little too pricey for me. Looking for something on the cheaper side.\nI have a car, but would prefer to not use it if the apartment is within walking distance. Thanks!",

They much rather collect on government money from section 8 tenants than regular ones and will displace you on the queue if they have the chance.\n\nAndros has gotten pretty bad in the last few years is what I hear. Car break ins all the time, unsavory characters, and the works.\n\nI\u2019d recommend legacy, either of \u201cThe parks at\u2026\u201d, eagle landing (but pricy), onshore or Bellamy",

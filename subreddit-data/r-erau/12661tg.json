I ended up getting a curved monitor ~3 years ago and it has seriously changed the way I study. I can have journals/PDFs, web browser, and word doc/essay open all at once with plenty of room. I will never go back to primarily using just a laptop.",

Anyone who tries to justify an expensive laptop purchase really only wants an excuse to game on it lmao\n\nYou are almost always better off using lab PCs for MATLAB/CATIA/cfd etc., but for aeronautics specfifically... yeah, other guy's right.\n\nYou're good with some crayons.",

I don\u2019t know if any minimum gpa to be accepted, but the acceptance rate of ERAU is ~80%, so I think you\u2019re probably okay. If you\u2019re still worried, you can always talk to an admission officer. The hardest part of ERAU isn\u2019t getting in but staying in, both for financial and academic reasons.",

Depending on if you want to be cynical or not, this results in 1.) people woth lower HS scores getting a chance to prove themselves in a new system, or 2.) Riddle being able to take your money for a year before dropping you if you\u2019re not good enough\n\nAt least in engineering, some classes are considered \u201cweed-out classes\u201d, meaning that many people won\u2019t pass them. Many get in, few get out. I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about getting into Riddle, the real battle is getting theough the weed-outs",

    "postText": "Like the caption says. Wondering how hard it is to get into the masters in aerospace engineering program with a concentration in aerodynamics and propulsion. I am currently wrapping up my junior year at NJIT in newark nj in mechanical engineering. Estimating I\u2019ll graduate with around a 3.0 gpa. Maybe a little lower or higher depending on how hard senior year is. Only in 1 club which is aero and all of my electives are aerospace related like dynamics of space flight, aerodynamics etc. what are my odds of getting in?",

Luckily (or unluckily) I grew up with pretty much nothing financially so I was eligible for just about every grant or form of aid imaginable so it wasn\u2019t too hard to get my undergrad paid for. Hoping I can do the same for graduate school. If not, how hard is it for graduate students to land an assistantship? If I\u2019m not mistaken, that gets you free tuition correct?",

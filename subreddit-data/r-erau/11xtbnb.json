I haven\u2019t taken any advanced math or science classes in high school like calculus or physics and I want to know if mechanical engineering is something that\u2019s possible for someone like me or if I should try something else. Also, in the ERAU portal, I have to take the ALEKS exam, and I\u2019m not sure how well I can do considering I haven\u2019t taken these sorts of classes, and help?",

Same stuff I\u2019ve already learned but the book for Math 241 explains stuff in a more complicated way. Anyway, you don\u2019t need to know any calculus prior to taking calculus. But if you don\u2019t do well on the aleks you will have to take a Pre Calculus before Calculus. I recommend reviewing trigonometry (soh cah toa) and algebra (especially division with fractions in the denominator and the multiplication and division of exponents",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a sophomore in high school and have wanted to become an airline pilot for about 6 years now. I am quite sure that this is what I want my future career to be. \n\nThe main reason for my post is that I want to understand some things about the school that I can\u2019t seem to find online anywhere. \n\nHere are some of my questions:\n\n1. Why should someone choose ERAU over another aviation program?\n\n2. Why is ERAU\u2019s graduation rate so low?\n\n3. What is the best degree to get if I want to become a professional pilot?\n\n4. If I were to get an aeronautical science degree, how much would that cost? Is it worth it?\n\n5. Are the teachers good? Do they care about the students?\n\n6. Given the low graduation rate, you would assume that ERAU is accepting unfit students. From your experience, are the students dedicated and serious about their education? \n\n8. I want to have a backup plan in case becoming a pro pilot doesn\u2019t work out. What minor do you think would be best as a back up plan?\n\n8. Do you have any other advice for me?\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "Here is the advice I have for you. Get your private pilots license done before you consider Erau for flight school. You will save thousands of dollars, enjoy it, and also skip the line in training straight to Instrument.\n\nCurrently the airline industry is dying for pilots. If you have your ATP regardless of where you graduate you will get hired.\n\nErau is cost prohibitive. I started as a pilot and quickly switched degrees to something related but different.\n\nMy advice is ERAU is overpopulated with students rn, it costs a lot as well. Consider another flight school such as ATP.\n\nIf you want a backup consider a Human Factors, Safety degree. Things related to aviation are popping off rn too but not as needed as pilots.",

            "comment": "1. If you get a lot of scholarships or financial aid it might be worth it.\n2. A lot of students transfer out or drop out due to cost.\n3. Apply as an aeronautical science student and then switch to aeronautics with a minor in aeronautical studies mid way thru your commercial single training. This allows you to still get the reduced hours from the FAA to go to the airlines and allows you to get your multi engine and cfi outside of riddle. saves a ton of time and money.\n4. All in all it cost me $200K dollars for flight and tuition.\n5. Yes all the professors are amazing. They care deeply about the students and want to see you succeed. Class sizes are like 15 students max so each professor knows each student by name.\n6. Riddle is pretty lenient about who they accept sure, but some of the first year classes or private pilot be sure to wash out some. For the most part though the students from all majors are very dedicated and career oriented. They chose riddle because the university specializes in their specific field.\n7. Minors don't really matter. I would recommend going for your aircraft dispatchers license which you can earn as apart of your degree program.\n8. Get your private pilots license before coming to riddle. Also come in with as many transfer credits and ap credits as possible. Riddle is very lenient about awarding transfer credit so any dual enrollment classes from high school will count.",

            "comment": "Strongly recommend  you complete your PPL before coming to ERAU.   We were lucky enough to figure this out and child did it  senior year in HS finished a month before going to Embry and  went straight to instrument.  Don't get to ERAU 'almost finished' with PPL - you must complete it before going - and ideally by HS senior year spring to get credit/help with class/training schedule.  B/c  lordy the wait to fly and the \"virtual reality\" training the freshmen PPL students have to endure does not look as fun/good (granted view from outside).  I feel like ERAU is really  accepting too many students due to need for pilots/numbers entering the field and the news of actual PPL freshman experience not fully out there yet.  Would love to hear from freshmen/parents who just did year 1 doing PPL and how that was directly.   So you pay all that money and then don't get to fly until second semester/do a bunch of flying with VR goggles instead?  I think they just don't have enough planes, instructors (getting hired to airlines), flying slots to serve everyone who is coming.\n\nBuckle down in HS to get the best grades you can, pass AP exams, and nail SAT/ACT to possibly get into honors program which gives registration and housing priority and get some scholarship money/credits toward your degree/community college credits in non-aviation requirements to reduce semesters needed to finish if possible.  Then do the \"speed run\" to finish ERAU in 3 years if possible to lower costs and switch to Aeronautics/FAA RATP approved major after/in middle of commercial single as mentioned above and make sure you get the 60 hours of Aviation course work listed in the RATP letter.   Then do Multi/CFI outside of Embry to avoid backlog and expense for the Embry Diamonds.  My student is into single commercial and we are looking at that switch in the coming year making sure we get the 60 hours of RATP required Aviation coursework completed to qualify for the RATP at 1000 hours instead of 1500 hours.\n\nAs a parent of student who just finished freshman year my student likes it! (without anything else to compare to and luckily clicks with randomly assigned roommate - as they enjoy similar nerdy things/are serious non partiers and has liked professors/young flight trainers - who are early 20's ERAU grads of just past several years).\n\nMaybe ERAU is just aggressively trying to make money to pay for \"all the nice things\" at Daytona Beach Campus?....fancy buildings/rec center/student union/new dorms/campus/nice new airplanes/\"feeling of a beautiful successful place\", etc. No idea if someone is making out/are execs/fat cats getting overpaid? - or if everything is just so expensive and they have to find a way to monetize everything to support it (requiring on campus housing/meals/etc). It feels and looks beautiful - there are nice people and kids there, enthusiastic stellar alumni network is real,  they def. want to create that 'feeling of success' to bring in students and yes I think they over- accept kids who can pay, bill the s\\*\\*\\* out of kids/families and pursue those bills even when students wash out. Have basic feeling of caring from the people there but ruthless billing/charging/collecting from the 'institution'.\n\nTo me ERAU feels a bit limited vs. 'regular universities' and all of the more varied coursework/programs and cultural experiences offered at other places that Embry lacks.  But - if you are serious about flying/aviation and a serious student, and can find your niche there with a club/group, get some advance/transfer credits, some scholarship money, and come in with your PPL it could be a good choice.",

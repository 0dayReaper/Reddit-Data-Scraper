    "postText": "I'm about to start my first semester in Daytona Beach and just looking at the costs in housing has my wallet gasping for air. I can accept that Riddle basically asks to be paid in gold plated blood. The housing is something I can control though and If i can save myself 20K over the course of my years there I would prefer to do so.\n\nAnyone have any interesting ways students have lived to go to Riddle? I am half wondering if I would be considered homeless for living out of my car with a Y membership for my amenities\n\nEdit:\nI am omitted from mandatory dorm stay and can't even get in if I wanted due to being 300+ on the waitlist",

At that time, it was easier to find a slip that allowed you to liveaboard; I\u2019ve heard that has gotten significantly harder to find. It honestly isn\u2019t a lifestyle I recommend if you\u2019re just trying to save money.

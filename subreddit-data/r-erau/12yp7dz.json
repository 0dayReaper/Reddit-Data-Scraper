    "postText": "Hello, I graduated from high school in Thailand. I contacted my HS to mail the transcript to ERAU for application, but my school could not do that. My HS sent me the official transcript to me instead. Is it possible for me to mail the official transcript to ERAU myself, or do I have to use the name of the sender by my school name? Btw, I am now in the U.S. So, I can use the UPS or USPS to mail them.",

By sealed, I don\u2019t mean licked and sealed, but that it\u2019s been stamped or sealed and some other way to indicate that it is not opened.",

Your school may offer some type of website (mine uses myschoolbucks) where you pay for the shipping and it will get sent off that way. I would consult your admissions advisor or even your high school counselor about options!",

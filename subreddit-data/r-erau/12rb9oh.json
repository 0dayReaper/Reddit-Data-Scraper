I'd often use a derivative calculator/ integral calculator to check I did it right on hw but on tests and stuff it was either mostly symbolic or values were easy to compute with no calculator\n\nNow ae courses require a calculator for sure",

I use Quizlet+ personally to see detailed explanations of concepts, they're often easier to understand than textbooks. Do what's best for you.",

    "postText": "I am planning on becoming an airline pilot. I am currently a Sophomore in high school, soon to be junior (it is currently summer for me). I am going to be starting flight training for my PPL in a few days. I should have my PPL by the end of junior year. I am planning on applying to Embry-Riddle. I\u2019ve heard a PPL looks good on an application. Is that true? I\u2019m planning on majoring in something other than Aeronautical science so I have a backup plan if needed. What are you opinions on Aeronautics and Business Aviation? Which one is more valuable?\n\nHere is my plan for becoming a pilot:\n\n1. Graduate high school with PPL\n2. Attend Embry Riddle and major in Aeronautics or Business Aviation. During that time, I will be building flight hours and getting my instrument ratings, etc. outside of ERAU.\n3. Graduate Embry Riddle and go into ATP flight school/United Aviate, etc. (fast track program)\n4. Become a CFI through ATP or another training program and build hours until I get to the minimum of 1000 hours for hiring. \n\nDoes this seem like a good plan?",

            "comment": "No point to pay the insane amount of tuition if you\u2019re just gonna fly on the outside, you might as well just spend that money at ATP and fly through the ratings. But if you want a backup degree look at any other school with Business/ Aviation Business (Auburn) and fly at a 61 outside of school. Also if you do instrument, commercial certs outside of riddle and not at another approved part 141 then you have to get 1500 hours instead of R-ATP (1000).\n\nAlmost all the other Aeronautical Science majors I know had their pilots licenses when they came in so it\u2019s good to apply with. Also, Aeronautics is a useless degree, definitely do not do it.",

I would recommend completing instrument and commercial single while you are at university at Riddle so you qualify for the 1000 hour r-atp. Come to riddle as an Aeronautical science major and switch to aeronautics once your done with commercial \n\nThen you can complete multi and CFI externally and still get the 1000 hour atp.",

Is it considered risky to change majors?\n\n3. How long would it take to get my commercial single and instrument?\n\n4. Could I switch majors to Business Aviation instead of aeronautics? (Would the hour reduction still be valid?)\n\n5. Is there an extended amount of time at Riddle if I switch majors? (Catch up with the curriculum)\n\n6. Are the 500 hours really that big of a deal? If I don\u2019t want to switch majors and all that, are those extra 500 hours going to hold me back?\n\n7. If I switch to Aeronautics and get a degree in aeronautics, it there any way I could use that degree for a fallback career? \n\nThanks again for your time.",

                            "comment": "1. Yes very common. The university created a minor called aeronautical studies just for that since aeronautics is a customized degree and you are required to take a minor. If you declare that minor you\u2019re basically getting an AS degree \n2. No\n3. It took me 8 months for instrument and 8 months for commercial which for riddle standards is pretty fast. \n4. No. You\u2019d have to check the letter of authorization to see approved majors for the hour reduction. But off of the top of my head the approved ones are Aeronautical Science, Aeronautics, Applied meteorology, ATC, Aviation maintenance, and a few other ones. \n5. No extended time needed. Only 1 extra class you need to take and it\u2019s like aviation research studies or something. In some cases you can graduate earlier or faster.\n6. Yeah it\u2019s a really nice perk of the aviation degree. Especially if you are a flight instructor that\u2019s 500 hours less that you don\u2019t have to instruct in order to go to the airlines. Could get you to the airlines a year faster.\n7. As apart of the aeronautics degree track you have the opportunity of earning your aircraft dispatcher certificate which is an excellent fallback if you lose your medical. \n\nAt Daytona they also have the 4+1 program so you can get your degree and do your masters in 1 year. One of the options is to get a MBA for business.\n\nMy advice is study what your passionate about. It will make school feel less like a drag. In addition if you haven\u2019t used your business degree in 20 years it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d get a job doing business because you\u2019ve been out of it for so long. With that being said aviation is way more than just flying. There\u2019s many operations, management, and dispatch roles available which are high paying and don\u2019t require a medical.",

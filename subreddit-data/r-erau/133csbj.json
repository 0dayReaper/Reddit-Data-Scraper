I\u2019m a little worried though, I visited campus recently and everyone I talked to pretty much said I\u2019ll just be studying with like no social life. I\u2019m planning on aerospace engineering but might switch to business, I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019ll be doing nothing outside of schoolwork though, is it really that bad?",

However, I was in one of the more intense non engineering majors and managed to: (1) help run a very active campus organization, (2) make lifelong friends, (3) meet the woman who would become my wife and spend a lot of time traveling to be with her in Deland, (4) get some very good grades once I learned how to balance those things well.\n\nIt\u2019s totally doable, don\u2019t let folks doom and gloom you!",

Also depends on how much you involve yourself in clubs or work. I found it\u2019s easy to balance it all but I\u2019m also a very motivated and diligent person to get my work done and sub,tired as early as possible. My advice is get in work as soon as you can so ur never stressing at the last min.",

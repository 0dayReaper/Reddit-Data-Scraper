    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI've been working on this parking guide app with my friend that goes to ERAU Daytona and we just launched an updated version over the weekend.\n\nThe app is only available for the Daytona campus for now. Let us know if you'd like to have it for the Prescott campus as well.\n\nPlease let us know what you think of it, so we can keep improving the app.\n\nThank you!\n\n[**iOS | Spott Parking Guide**](https://apple.co/3CHfdge)\n\n[**Android | Spott Parking Guide**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spott_parking_app&amp;referrer=utm_source%3DReddit%26utm_medium%3DOrganic%2520Post%26utm_content%3DExposure%26utm_campaign%3DERAU%2520Reddit%26anid%3Dadmob)\n\n**Update #1:** The current sign-up issue is most likely due to the ERAU email provider Outlook blocking the arrival of the verification email. We are currently implementing a fix to deliver the verification email in a different way such that Outlook will give us a pass. The fix will take 24-48 hours to take effect. Stay tuned.\n\n**Update #2:** The issue has been resolved. You will have to update the app to be able to use it as we had to launch a new version with the bugs fixed. Please reach out to me here or at [park@spottparking.com](mailto:park@spottparking.com) if you find any other issues. Thanks!",

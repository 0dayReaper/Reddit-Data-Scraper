    "postText": "Disclaimer: This plan is based upon starting as a student pursuing a degree in Aeronautical Science and then switching to Aeronautics. It is possible to graduate in 2 years with an Aeronautical Science degree, but it might take longer due to the requirement to complete CFI and Multi.\n\nThere is no secret that Aviation Colleges are expensive and slow. Many students take out over $250K in student loans for their flight training and a college degree. Normally it also takes them roughly 4.5-5 years to complete their degree and flight training. This is a step-by-step plan to earn a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautics from Embry-Riddle as fast as possible. This plan can also be generally applied to other university flight programs, but YMMV.\n\nStep 1 **Earning your Private Pilot certificate before attending University**: This is the single most important thing someone can do before attending a University Flight Program. A lot of universities across the country have very long waitlists for their Private Pilot Courses. Some universities commonly mentioned on this subreddit have had waitlists of up to 2 years just due to a lack of instructors or too many students. Not only that but in some flight programs, it takes students well over a year to earn their private. Coming in with your Private Pilot Certificate will put you a year ahead in your flight progression and allow you to start instrument training right away. In addition, you can get your Private Certificate for less than what you would normally pay at the University and in less time. **At Embry-Riddle, the admissions directors are encouraging prospective students to earn their Private Pilot Certificate before coming to the university.** In addition, Riddle gives you 6 college credits for coming in with your certificate. \n\nStep 2 **Come into University with transfer credits**: I highly recommend trying to get as many general education credits done at a Community College before attending University. They are generally way cheaper than credit at university and they are sometimes the classes are easier. For those students still in high school take as many dual enrollment credits as possible. If there are options for taking a class as dual enrollment credit or an AP/IB do the Dual enrollment class since you won\u2019t have to pass an exam to get credit. Embry-Riddle is very generous with transfer credits and AP credits. You generally only need a 3 on AP exams to get credit for a class. For transfer credits, they try and get the class to apply to your degree, but if it doesn\u2019t, they will just count it as elective credits. **Transfer credits give you a higher class standing.** I came to University as a Sophomore because I had so many credits and it allowed me to register for my classes a day earlier than my friends. It allowed me to have little to no issues getting the classes I wanted. In addition, going into an aviation college program you want to fly, not take random English classes or Business Classes. While the general classes are important, I feel as if your time and money can be better spent with either a lighter class schedule or **getting ahead in your degree program.**\n\nIt is very feasible to come into Riddle with well over 60 credits which will push you well into Junior class standing. Juniors get to pick their classes the day after Seniors do.\n\nClasses required for Aeronautical Science: [https://imgur.com/gallery/EdO06kK](https://imgur.com/gallery/EdO06kK)\n\nCourse catalogue: [https://catalog.erau.edu/prescott/aviation/bachelors/aeronautical-science/#planofstudytext](https://catalog.erau.edu/prescott/aviation/bachelors/aeronautical-science/#planofstudytext)\n\nAP/IB Credits accepted: [https://prescott.erau.edu/admissions/faq](https://prescott.erau.edu/admissions/faq)\n\nTransfer credits accepted: [https://prescott.erau.edu/admissions/credit](https://prescott.erau.edu/admissions/credit)\n\nStep 3 **Switch to** **Aeronautics Program**: The main appeal of going to an Aviation college is to earn your R-ATP at 1000 hours. Per the regulations, it states to be eligible for the 1000-hour minimum is that you take 60 credits of aviation coursework and that you complete your Instrument Rating and Commercial Certificate at the University. You can complete your Private, Commercial Multi Addon, and CFI outside the university and still be eligible for your R-ATP. At Embry-Riddle students in the flight program, they are pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Science. Under that degree program, the university requires that you either earn your Multi or CFI to graduate. The problem is both programs have waitlists over 8 months long for an instructor. In addition, the multi-engine aircraft at Riddle is the Diamond Da-42 twin star. It\u2019s a very fun plane to fly, however, they constantly break and go down for maintenance. The multi-course is relatively short but can take 5 months and cost a lot of money. There are many schools across the country where you can **get your multi for cheap and fast (generally in a week)**. When you do multi most nonuniversity programs you\u2019ll only get roughly 10 hours. To go to the airlines, you will need 25 hours. **A good tip is to just earn your MEI certificate because it requires 15 hours of PIC time** which will get you the 25 hours total needed plus an additional certificate. For CFI the Embry-Riddle CFI program is very thorough and can take up to 8 months to complete for just CFI. The CFII course is usually faster and can be obtained in 3 months. The CFI program is very good and Riddle will train you to be a very good instructor, but it is very expensive and very time-consuming. The major downside is that to graduate under the CFI track under Aeronautical Science you need to earn your CFI and CFII. I have seen many instructors at Riddle not being able to graduate college because they haven\u2019t yet earned their CFII despite working at the University at a CFI. **Outside of Embry-Riddle, you can easily earn your CFI, CFII, and MEI in about 2 months.** \n\nWhen you first attend Embry-Riddle you will be pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Science. To make the switch to Aeronautics you need to: \n\n1.  Declare a minor (Can be any minor, but the most popular are Weather, Safety, or ATC)\n\n2.  Take the aircraft dispatcher class (You can earn your aircraft dispatcher certificate)\n\nAeronautics Program: [https://imgur.com/gallery/tp392HH](https://imgur.com/gallery/tp392HH)\n\nFAA R-ATP LOA w/ accepted courses: [https://prescott.erau.edu/-/media/files/prescott/college-of-aviation/r-atp-letter-of-authorization.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=A0826C92BF38165D0B556BC57BD9768999D0F35D](https://prescott.erau.edu/-/media/files/prescott/college-of-aviation/r-atp-letter-of-authorization.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=A0826C92BF38165D0B556BC57BD9768999D0F35D) (This one is important for Aeronautics to make sure that you can meet the 60 required credits **\\[IMPORTANT\\] any credits transferred in cannot count towards the 60 required credits i.e. if you transfer in your private pilot cert or a weather class.**\n\n**WARNING:** If you do decide to switch to Aeronautics **make sure you do it at the right time.** The university does not like this degree program for flight and will try and cause a fit. They will bar you from future flight courses and ground schools. So, make sure you **switch it after you complete AS321 (Commercial Ground) and FA321 (Commercial Single)** so you can still get your R-ATP. \n\nStep 4 **Attending Summer School and staying breaks**: Summer school is a great opportunity to get ahead in your coursework and graduate early. **I recommend taking 12 credits over the summer.** Riddle offers 2 summer sessions Summer A and Summer B. I would recommend taking 6 credits during each session. The classes are chill and sometimes the professors go easier on you. \n\nAs a flight student Embry-Riddle expects you to stay over summer break and winter break to finish up your flight ratings. While it was hard staying up and working while my friends were playing and having a fun summer, staying over breaks allowed me to finish much faster and ahead of schedule. Hard work pays off. \n\nBonus tips:\n\nAfter you earn your private pilot certificate you can earn your remote pilot certificate by taking an online class. It will allow you to make money commercially by flying a drone. In addition, Embry-Riddle will **award you with 3 free college credits** if you show them your cert.\n\nWhen you do your instrument rating try and get a night flight block because there are more aircraft and simulators available. In addition, for your R-ATP you need 200 of nighttime and you\u2019ll get a ton of nighttime from instrument. \n\nTLDR; Come to Riddle with your private, have transfer credits, switch to aeronautics, don\u2019t do Multi or CFI at Riddle, take summer school, and fly as much as possible over breaks.",

            "comment": "As someone who did the AS-&gt;Aeronautics jump, I have a couple of things people doing this may want to consider. Riddle is very hit-or-miss with transfer credit, so be sure to check that Riddle will accept it before spending money on things you want to transfer in. \n\nAlso, when I tried to get credit for my remote pilot cert, my advisor denied it and said they are not allowed to do it anymore. I have heard rumors of people doing it in prior years, but that was not my experience. Understand that aside from your PPL, any certificates/ratings you get outside of Riddle do not give you any credits.\n\nWhen going from AS-Aero, you must be 1000% sure that you meet the R-ATP LOA 60hr minimum. DO NOT RELY ON ADVISORS TO HELP YOU WITH IT. I say this because the advisors are great and all, but Riddle is losing a ton of AS students to Aeronautics and seem to be discouraging students from doing it wherever possible. Hence, the inability to register for AS321/321L/421. When I made the switch, I was told that it was on me to determine my eligibility.\n\nDo not be surprised if Riddle takes more drastic measures to prevent Aeronautics students from receiving the R-ATP reduced mins, because the flight department has every reason to do so. Keep a close eye on whether the catalog changes every year prior to you being ready to switch to Aeronautics. If you do decide to switch, try to make it happen as soon as possible after completing commercial flight and ground, or CFI if you wanna take that via Riddle. This is because you lock in your catalog year, and any changes Riddle makes to the Aeronautics program will not be a problem for you.\n\nOn the bright side, this path does sometimes present a more affordable option than AS. In addition to the minors you brought up, there's another good option. Continuing to take the same AS classes you would be otherwise taking will get you an Aeronautical Studies minor, so it's basically built-in. That said, I would highly, highly, highly recommend the ATC program.\n\nLastly, please temper your time expectations. Stuff happens, we could get snow for weeks in PRC, if you're in Daytona thunderstorms could ground you for a while, or any number of other things could prevent you from flying. I've seen plenty of friends who study hard for their flight courses get held way back because of unlucky combinations of weather, maintenance, instructor scheduling, or even medical delays. It's a good thing to be ambitious and want to get out quick, but please understand that it may or may not actually happen how you expect. I did instrument to multi doing this method in less than 2 years, and graduated in 3 having not transferred anything except PPL. It is possible to do it in less than that, but try to budget with the expectation of it taking more time than you'd think. If you have your PPL, you probably know by now that everything in aviation costs more than you'd hoped it would.\n\nAnyways, that's just my two cents. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm a rising HS senior planning to do ERAU's dual enrollment program. I'll be taking the Phys 150/160/250 sequence, and I was wondering how the workload of these classes was. \n\nHow many hours a week would one typically do for hw?\nDid the classes require a lot of studying?\nHow difficult generally were the exams?\nAlso, how calculus intensive was the material?\n\nAppreciate any responses!",

            "comment": "physics for engineers 1 really isn\u2019t all that bad just make sure you actually study and grasp the material. The exams are easy, there\u2019s a practice exam you can take that pulls questions from the same question bank on the actual exam. just make sure you understand it.",

I prefer homework to be graded, not exclusively these weekly exams. And these exams arnt made super well. Some questions arnt totally checked/correct and a lot of profs struggle to keep up with the schedule the exam demand. \n\nAnd my last tip is to avoid Mark Reynolds at all costs",

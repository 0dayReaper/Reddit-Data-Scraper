While most Greek life would be cool with it on the surface, for example, you need to be sure that they hold that view behind closed doors. Some have had brothers actively transition and been 100% behind them, while others have been less accepting of it.",

I can't personally speak for his experience, with every place you go there will be ups and downs, but Prescott has a good community. I highly advise to reach out to people who might be in your area or who you connect with online - from my perspective, it was a lot easier for my roommate because he'd met us online way before we ever came to the school and there was no awkwardness between us.",

I don't think it will be unsafe but it's going to be significantly harder than if you were going to a university in the middle of a larger city. \n\nI hope you're not going for flight, given how sensitive a pilot medical is you might have to check some boxes depending on the medical form, if you're using medications as part of your transition. Be sure to check with an AME before starting any new meds.",

Trans people can join YAF. Not everyone with an identity crisis has to join anything goes anime club.  \nRiddle doesn't have a culture war, so don't bring politics into it.",

I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a student group / club that can help you to have a network of supportive people to be with. Best of luck.",

One of my best friend\u2019s ROTC buddies is a trans guy too and before COVID he seemed to be living his best life with a girlfriend and everything. \n\nGender-inclusive housing is debuting this fall, I don\u2019t know too much about it yet but I\u2019m signed up &amp; I\u2019d recommend you say you\u2019re \u201cvery interested\u201d in it on your housing application too so that a Residence Life coordinator can get you settled into a safe and comfortable environment.",

He doesn\u2019t go to our school, and he\u2019s not representative of who we are.\nEmbry-Riddle is the only place where I\u2019ve felt comfortable to be out as bi, to speak freely about my personal and political beliefs, and to do what I love without fear of judgment. There are shitty people (like my weird covidiot suitemates last semester, for example) but I\u2019ve found a home here and I think you can too. \n\nI don\u2019t claim to understand how hard it\u2019s going to be, as I\u2019m straight-passing and cisgender and have it wayyy easier, but I\u2019m in your corner and you\u2019ll find that your RA (the leader of your dorm basically), the Orientation Team, and other people you\u2019ll meet as you come to college are in your corner too. \n\nI\u2019d suggest you reach out to the officers of the P.R.I.D.E. Club through CampusGroups, maybe they can tell you firsthand about experiences with campus climate and administration. Even if it\u2019s not at Riddle, I really hope that you have a great time in college and live as the best and happiest version of yourself  :)",

Even things you might expect to be averse to it (such as Greek life) is very, very accepting of those that transition, barring one or two specific organizations that are, shall we say, more *traditional*. \n\nIn fact, my fraternity has had multiple brothers make the transition. \n\nJust avoid the right-leaning political or religious student groups and basically everyone else will welcome you with open arms.",

Personally I haven't seen much hate towards trans people here, and most of the hate I have seen has been targeted at non-binary people. However, given my prior statement about campus being conservative, it wouldn't surprise me if it exists on a larger scale than I've seen. That being said, I know you can transition here, I have a friend who's transitioning MtF, and as far as I know she hasn't had any issues. There's also an LGBT club where you could get plenty of support. So in short, it's a safe place to transition as long as you're careful about who you associate with.",

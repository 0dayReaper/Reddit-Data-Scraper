    "postText": "Looking to attend ERAU Daytona campus for aerospace engineering, unsure if undergrad or grad. I know that the cost is UNGODLY expensive, which is why I\u2019m looking for any and all opportunities to cut that down. Here are some of my qualities for merit and other scholarships if they apply:\n\n3.9 unweighted gpa (3 APs which is all my school offers, a few honors, and some dual enrollment classes)\n1400 SAT (awaiting ACT, probably around a 30 for that)\nWoman (if that applies for stem)\nI\u2019m also involved in extracurriculars such as theater, speech/debate, FFA, and band\nCurrently living out of state\n\nWould any of these help me gain good scholarships? If so, how much and what percentage of total tuition would that cover? I\u2019ve also heard of dean and presidential scholarships, what do they mean and how do I qualify for them? Thanks!",

You\u2019ll probably have luck getting external scholarships for women in engineering, so that should help some more too. Just apply to anything and everything, even if you don\u2019t fit all of the criteria. \n\nIf you keep up your gpa in college, study hard, and stay out of trouble you\u2019ll have no problems keeping your scholarships. Good luck!",

It only lasts four years and won't carry past that but it's still $4,000.  \nMost people who's parents are loaded start stacking outside scholarships  \nTalk to the office of fellowships(?) or email the school and ask for that department. All they do is try to hook up students with grants and scholarships",

AND if they have a WW campus in your state, like Georgia for example has a WW campus there, you can take online classes to cut costs for a year with in state tuition!   \n\n\nIdk what state you're in, but in Georgia we have Hope and Zeal Miller scholarships for in state tuition only, and it covers like 85%-100% of your tuition if you have a 3.0 or 3.3 respectively. So if I had known and done WW classes for a year, it literally would have been almost free with scholarships on the in state online tuition. I'd consider it!  \n\n\neither way definitely get the free alumni recommendation scholarship. Just make a post asking someone from this sub to recommend you and they'll know what to do",

    "postText": "wondering if anyone has successfully switched to Aeronautics major from AS in soph/Jr. year after completing Instrument and Commercial ratings at ERAU and getting 60 hours of Aviation courses completed among those listed in the FAA-ERAU R-ATP Authorization letter - and getting the \"approved for R-ATP 1000 hrs\" on their transcript without too much drama?  Are there any trip ups?  Will admin discourage/try to block this?\n\nson trying to finish early due to costs and wants to do Multi add-on after graduation outside of ERAU at a part 61 (or would multi have to be done at a 141?).  thanks for any thoughts/advice/experiences you have had or heard about along these lines.",

Id recommend doing the aeronautical studies minor so the AS classes count and you don\u2019t have to take anything extra.\n\nBig disclaimer if you came in with your private the credits do not count towards R-ATP and you will need to take 6 more credits\n\nMulti and CFI can be done outside of riddle via this route at a part 61 school. Your son is smart for figuring it out",

I originally got 70/100, which was just below the cutoff score for no required programs, but have gotten a 95 on 100 in the 2nd attempt after the learning modules.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inseummw92pa1.png?width=2532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e929c4633ff397dc87ab4f4f2957c0a314297199\n\nI've already mastered all the topics\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbpgop32a2pa1.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ed9e25c0ed6ca46ae03686f3b0b4d70639f77ecb\n\nYet the notification has not gone away? It's been \\~3-4 hours since I've undertaken it.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ci049pm5a2pa1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3e61367016f02e9644cb2ca58bdf1cc77f6b2e68\n\nCan anybody advise me on what to do? I am a little worried.",

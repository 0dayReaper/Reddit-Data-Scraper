Yes, he got fired. Is it any better nowadays? Somehow I doubt it. \n\nI also personally had issues with Silverman, who used to be in charge of Title IX. No idea if she's still there. She never quite caught on to the idea that it's possible to empower women *without* being a misandrist.\n\nTL;DR: Desantis is an asshole and the policy is shit, but Riddle ODI is way, way worse and still needs an overhaul.",

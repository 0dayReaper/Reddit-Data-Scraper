    "postText": "Have a question about classes, events, acceptance, or anything of the sorts? Review this frequently asked questions to see if it\u2019s already been answered. If not, feel free to comment down below.\n\n**Q:** Is my GPA good enough for Embry-Riddle?\n\n*A:* Assuming you don\u2019t fail major classes in high school and aren\u2019t left behind, maintaining a GPA of 2.5 unweighted or higher will more than likely guarantee you admission. Embry-Riddle has an acceptance rate of 63.3% as of fall 2018. Based on 2019 statistics, the Prescott campus has an acceptance rate of 65.69%, and the Daytona Beach campus has an acceptance rate of 60.94%. Between the two campuses, the average acceptance rate is 62.39%. The university does have a high dropout rate due to the rigorous nature of many of our academic programs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** Are my test scores, AP, SAT, ACT, IB, AICE, etc. good enough?\n\n*A:* Embry-Riddle does not require American students to submit test scores. If students decide, you may or may not receive additional scholarships and aid from the school. An SAT of 900+ typically is acceptable for all but math-heavy majors. You may find the engineering courses harder if math and physics are not your strong suit. ACT scores of 18+ are also acceptable. The SAT scores of Embry-Riddle applicants fall between 1110 and 1320, while ACT scores fall between 22 and 29. For AP, IB, and AICE, if you passed your final, may give you college credit and remove any redundant classes. Contact your high school counselor about college credit prior to emailing your academic advisors at ERAU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How much does it cost to attend ERAU?\n\n*A:* Embry-Riddle averages out to about $20k\\* USD per academic year after financial aid (Fall and Spring semesters combined). Scholarships are available for students to help lower the cost of attendance. Eligible students may receive the presidential scholarship, which varies in amount from person to person. Female applicants to the Prescott campus are eligible to receive the $5,000 per year \u201cWomen in Excellence\u201d scholarship. You do not have to apply for either of these scholarships. Embry-Riddle does offer a $1,000 a year \u201cAlumni Endorsement\u201d scholarship, which one has to apply for.\n\nAeronautical Science majors will have an additional $20k-$30k\\* per semester ($40k-$60k\\* per academic year). \\**Prices may vary, consult your financial aid package &amp; Ernie account.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** When do I get acceptance letters?\n\n*A:* Embry-Riddle runs on a rolling-admission process for undergraduates, which means you can apply any time throughout the year leading up to the week of classes, though this is not recommended. Assuming you apply in the fall of senior year, you can expect a decision via email, mail, or by logging into your student portal, Ernie, all within two (2) months after your submission. Upon admission, you should expect in the mail your welcome package containing your financial aid package, move-in date, medical requirements, and anything else to finish the registration the following month. **If you have applied in the Fall of senior year and are expecting to attend in the Summer semester or immediate Fall semester after graduation and have not received any information come May of your graduating year, contact admissions. Lastly, you can potentially maximize the amount of scholarship money you receive by applying by October 1st of your senior year Fall semester.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How do I check my cost for attending ERAU?\n\n*A:* When logging into your student portal, Ernie, assuming you\u2019re on a desktop or laptop, the left-hand side and tab of the main page will show you the outstanding costs you owe, total and per semester, as well as the amount of aid you\u2019ve received. The outstanding is subtracted from the standard total and your scholarships/aid. You must head into Canvas to choose with scholarships you want. Then it will update your outstanding amount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** What is Preview Day and is it worth it?\n\n*A:* Preview day gives incoming freshmen the opportunity to see the campus and if it fits their needs. You have to cover your own costs of transportation, food, hotel, and other expenses. Attending Preview Day gives you the opportunity to get your student ID, select classes, and meet other students. However, all this can be done online via Ernie and on orientation, which is required. Preview Day is not required.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How do I choose my roommate?\n\n*A:* You can choose a roommate by posting a comment on the Schools App, knowing them from outside of ERAU, meeting them at Preview Day, or you\u2019ll be given a randomized roommate selection if you do not decide by the deadline, which is typically in June. Roommate selection must be mutual between you and your roommate. Dormmates also must be mutually accepted. To request a roommate &amp; dormmates, you\u2019ll all need each other\u2019s student ID and student emails. Requesting can be done in your student portal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** How do I pick classes and which ones for my major?\n\n*A:* You will need to access Canvas through Ernie and have to add the classes you need into your \u201cshopping cart.\u201d On the Ernie page, you can search for class selection suggestions by major in the search bar at the top of the page. Your academic advisor will review your class selection and notify you if you\u2019re missing a class requirement or don\u2019t need a class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q:** I have an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and/or medical conditions that require special care, how can ERAU help me?\n\n*A:* Depending on your needs, the university will make sure that their care for you is in accordance with your requirements. You can start by contacting Disability Services. If you have an IEP, students will be given extra exam time and special accommodations. However, this is subject to the professor you have. If you require specialized or private housing, this is usually acceptable for students who qualify, depending on availability. If you are unsure, contact your advisor.\n\n**Q:** What is the social scene like? What campus activities are there? Are there parties? Is there Greek life?\n\n*A:*  Both Campuses: Through Ernie, you can access \u201cEagle Life,\u201d formerly known as \u201cControl Tower\u201d in the toolbar. Using Control Tower, you can \u201cshop\u201d for clubs and sports you may be interested in along with other essential information. If you have not yet been admitted to ERAU and are wondering if a sports team or type of club exists on our campus, ask here.\n\nPrescott: The Arizona campus is home to 6 fraternities and 3 sororities. Our sororities include Alpha Sigma Tau, Alpha Xi Delta, and Delta Phi Epsilon. Our fraternities include Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Tau Gamma, and Theta Xi. Prescott is the smaller of the two residential campuses and is quiet living. Partying is not really common and if parties do occur, you find out after the fact. You really have to seek out the partying crowd for this kind of life. Students may be a bit quiet and reserved here, but that just comes with the territory when going to a STEM university. Our student government does a good job putting on unique events for our student body.\n\nDaytona Beach: The Florida campus is home to 9 fraternities and 4 sororities. Our sororities include Alpha Xi Delta, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Theta Phi Alpha, and Sigma Kappa. Our fraternities include Delta Chi, Delta Upsilon, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Beta Theta Pi. Daytona Beach is the largest of the two residential campuses. Things at Daytona Beach may appear more social and lively. Partying is still extremely uncommon, and you still have to try to seek out the partying crowd. Partying is occasional and usually on the beach. Quiet and reserved students are still prevalent on this campus. Our student government does a good job putting on unique events for our student body.\n\n**Q:** Is there a decent-sized Discord server within the university community?\n\n*A:* [Yes! Community Discord.](https://discord.gg/WHWTnj6)  There are some other communities that are advertised on this [Community Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/erau/comments/g6et0w/erau_community_advertisement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I applied as an AE major at DB and I just want to know what it's like. I visited the school and definitely think it would be a great School to attend but I want to get more information. I have a few questions:\n\n1. Is it better than some of the alternatives nearby (UCF, FIT, etc.) or even far away (RPI, Purdue, etc.)?\n\n2. What brought you to the school?\n\n3. Is it worth the money?\n\nSorry if that is too many annoying questions. Thanks. :)",

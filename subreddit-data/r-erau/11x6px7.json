    "postText": "Last Wednesday, I submitted my application and all materials needed and was told to expect a decision to come out in 7-10 business days and I will be notified by email to check my decision. However a few hours ago I randomly checked my application status through ERNIE student resources and it changed from pending admission decision to admitted and I have to do the orientation? Then I received a text that says congratulations on getting in. Is that it? It is very underwhelming since this is my top choice university. I mean, I did not even receive an email to check my status like they said and just received a text after randomly checking my portal since I was bored. I applied as a worldwide applicant if it makes a difference. Does this actually mean I am in or should I wait for an offical email/letter? This is very confusing",

I was never notified by mail when I got in 4 years ago, I was the same as you saw I got in through the portal and then got the package in the mail. It may be different for WW, I am a DB student, but a welcome letter is still likely to come in. You can also give WW admissions a call as well if you have more questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat major will you be studying?",

Being able to see the Air Force Cadre multiple times a week really gets me moving and heavy so I imagine it\u2019s the same for you. You have a good selection of classes for your Interdisciplinary Studies major and if I remember correctly you\u2019ll only need to bring a crayon and a pack of diapers since they\u2019re super hard. You may want to invest in a supercomputer for AS-120 though.",

If you can move AF101 that'd be nice but whatever. Tuesday/Thursday off is freaking awesome and makes up for the tough days. \n\nOne semester I only had Tuesday Thursday classes.

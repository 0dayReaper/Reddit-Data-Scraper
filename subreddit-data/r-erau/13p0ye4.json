    "postText": " \n\nNote that this is a burner account because I don't want some people seeing this. I go to the Prescott Campus. The financial aid that I risk losing is the Presidential Scholarship. I am also now on Academic Probation.\n\nAre any of you familiar with the sap appeal process of appealing a financial aid suspension? If I can get documentation from a therapist backing up that my mental health was terrible and that I can do better next semester, have solid plans to, and will keep meeting with them to ensure that I don't make the same mistakes again, will they likely accept it? One of the financial aid staff told me a couple of months ago that as long as I give any reason and a reasonable argument that I will improve, they will accept it since it's first time.\n\nBut the wording on the appeal form is really worrying me. It says \"Appeals will only be approved for extenuating circumstances that seriously affected your academic performance. Examples include, but are not limited to, illness or injury of the student, divorce/separation, death of a relative, natural disaster or national emergency.\"\n\nHopefully my argument and documentation from a therapist will be sufficient as an \"extenuating circumstance\", considering i could show how bad of a place i was in due to my personal issues, even if it was not the result of any actual life events like the type listed? I had really bad executive disfunction, and I think that I could likely get an ADHD diagnosis (or at least something else explaining my issues). And based off my steller high school grades and how bizarre my underperformance was last semester, I can prove that I can and will do better with therapy. But I'm very worried with how different the language is on the appeal form. Hopefully that employee I talked to knew what he was talking about, and first time acceptance of this appeal is more generous than the language on the forum lets on. I'm going to talk to the financial aid office tomorrow and also figure out getting appointments with a therapist at school.",

Since its obvious your grades were quite bad to cause probation and fin aid loss, it's probably best to try to get those off your GPA and just retake. They're not going to reinstate fin aid (which obv has academic requirements to maintain) if your grades are so bad you're on probation.",

If this is your first appeal, they will accept it unless you tell them to fuck their mother. I did it a couple years ago and pretty much just said that I would try harder in the future and they accepted it. Most people who go to Prescott are awkward/autistic and try to bring you down with them, this sub is a microcosm of that, this isn\u2019t the best place for advice.",

Also, remember that fin aid probation is completely different from actual academic probation. I think fin aid wants you to have at least a 2.0 GPA and actual academic probation is consecutive semesters below a 2.0. I\u2019m 85% that those are the numbers.",

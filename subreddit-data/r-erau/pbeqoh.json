    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI took your advice on how to handle my roommate, I talked to him this morning about it and he told me that it is just a natural thing and I shouldn't be shaming him for it. I left for a couple hours after that conversation and came back to my bed and shoes covered in what I hope is just lotion for my own sanity. That was my last straw and I talked to my RA and they are going to move me to another room, thanks everyone for the advice and hears to hopefully a better start of freshman year.",

If thats his jizz, that right there is grounds to get him kicked out. Thats disgusing and dangerous, you don't know what kind of viruses this dude is carrying.\n\nAlso he deserves to be shamed, shitting is natural too but no one goes around shitting on someone elses SHOES AND BED WHILE THEY'RE IN THE SAME ROOM.",

Suite mates would pop the locks in the connecting bathroom during the day while we were in class and steal stuff from our fridge like???? Why??? Lol I truly hope it gets better for you. If I were to offer any advice, do not let these people ruin your dorm life experience. Speak up, move rooms, whatever you need to do. Don\u2019t look back on it in 4 years and only remember bad things !! And don\u2019t forget how much they\u2019re making you pay for this stuff either :|",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI have recently moved into my dorm, The first day I met my roommate he was a little shy and nervous but as hours passed he started doing things like he would literally watch hours of porn while having his hand down his pants doing something, I mean literal hours the first hour we just sat in silence but then he just popped his laptop out and starting watch, anyway I endured having to sit near him.\n\n When it became dark I snuggled into bed and I started hearing moaning and I looked over I could see him jacking under the covers as to not bring attention to himself, it lasted a minute or two and then it just stopped. I don't know what too do since maybe it is just a thing I have to get use too or what. Any advice on how to handle this situation, should I just let it be since I don't want too be a burden on him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nany advice is appreciated :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Nobody wants to be around subject to that shit. \n\nMove out / report him / hit him with a sock filled with quarters while he\u2019s doing it, hard to defend yourself with one hand on your Dick and the other typing on pornhub. \n\nHe\u2019s either a pervert or he has a porn addiction. Both need therapy.",

    "postText": "After looking at the erau website, I found out that it\u2019s required to live in a campus dorm for 2 years, or you can live off campus if you live within 50 miles of the campus for a full calendar year prior to starting.\n\nIs there any way around this? I live across the country and have a dog, so my only option is to live off campus with family who live around 65 miles away (we will move to around 40 miles when I get down there). However, I cannot afford to live in their apartment without financial aid for a year, so this is also not an option. Preferably, I could get into college as soon as I graduate high school.\n\nHas anyone received an exception for this clause?",

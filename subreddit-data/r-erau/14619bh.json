    "postText": "I see that the BS Engineering through ERAU Worldwide is now ABET accredited. My question is: How will this general engineering degree with no specific focus (electrical, mechanical, etc.) be viewed? \n\nFor the record, I have about ten years of electro-mechanical troubleshooting experience, mainly as an Air Force avionics technician, and now as a medical device Field Service Engineer. I have an electronics based Associate\u2019s degree as well as a BS Aeronautics (ERAU WW). I do not have a schedule which would allow for me to go to school in person locally (and none of these programs offer night school). \n\nThanks for the insight!",

I was thinking about going back to my local university to finish my EE but it would take me a while to finish the 11 or so classes. \n\nA lot of the job I've seen are looking for a stem degree. I feel like a multidisciplinary in engineering may suffice for a majority of them.",

It appears there is still time, though. \n\nUnfortunately, there just are not any good opportunities to finish an engineering degree in my area.",

The campus has several problems such as leaking water/water not even working, partly broken elevators with one having its certification of operation out of date which is illegal, some nr3 residents don't have furniture and/or appliances in their dorms, and a few others.",

Just wanted to clear up a misconception about the robots though--- they were purchased/contracted by Sodexo USA and not the school. It was a totally independent decision that the school more than likely did not influence.",

    "postText": "I totally get wanting to make money but can we talk about how unfair it is to make people pay for grad tickets? My friend got asked to pay $100. I'm sorry someone else's family can't make it, my own cannot, but this is making it very inequitable for low income families. I get people are hurting that their own families cannot make it, but you cannot tell me it is fair some people get to bring 5+ people because they can afford to pay $500 while some low-income/first gen can't bring 1 extra important person because their family cant pay that much.\n\nEdit: if you are one of the people selling tickets for that much, please take a step back and reconsider. There\u2019s really no way to justify asking that much.",

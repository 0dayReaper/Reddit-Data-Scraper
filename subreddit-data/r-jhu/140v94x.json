            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak to early grad although based on what I heard from BME friends about their major, I imagine it would be very very stressful and not really worth it. Esp if you don\u2019t have a ton of AP credits. \n\nstudy abroad wise though, I worked at the study abroad office when I was at hop and can say it is very possible to do it as a BME! you just may need to plan ahead more than other majors might. \n\nWhen you start this fall, make an appointment w the Global Education Office - they can walk you through what programs are a good option for you and you can take that info to your BME advisor (when you get assigned one) to plan out your schedule. \n\nIf you do want to study abroad, I\u2019d very strongly advise against graduating early as it\u2019ll only make things more complicated and give you v little flexibility w your schedule. I would also recommend considering a summer abroad program (if you can afford it / get funding) - that gives you a bit more flexibility as well!",

BME majors already have to complete more credits than some other majors at JHU at 128, so it\u2019s quite a grind to finish early. If you want to, I recommend looking into the 3+1 BS/MSE program, you can earn a Masters on top of your BS in the standard 4 years. Good luck!",

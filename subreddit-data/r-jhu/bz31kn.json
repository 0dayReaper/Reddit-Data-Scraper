    "postText": "Hi friends,\n\nWhen I was a student at Johny hop, I became seriously ill to the point that I was hospitalized for a while. My college friends would continuously line up outside my hospital room to come see me, because the room couldn't fit all my visitors, and we would laugh about memes, and lampoon all the professors who refused to give me extensions on assignments, and joke about how maybe I had so many visitors because the premed snakes could construe visiting me as free 'patient facing experience'. \n\nNow that I'm in the real world and seriously ill, I'm alone in a hospital room, and nobody at work cares enough to call or even send me an email to check in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnjoy Johny Hop while you can &lt;/3",

    "postText": "I'm currently a freshman and haven't decided on my major yet. As of now, I'm interested in going into biotech/pharma. What major would be best for this?\n\nI'm not BME, so it's either Mol/cell, ChemBE (or biophysics). Right now, I'm thinking of doing mol/cell major + CS minor, but I heard that mol/cell isn't a very employable major and a cs minor might not mean much. I heard that ChemBE may be more useful but also requires a series of difficult, process engineering courses that can be a waste of time. Prob going to get a PhD later on.\n\nWhat do you think? Thanks",

ChemBE would pipe you into chemical engineering roles. For more computational stuff such as bioinformatics and data analysis, consider CS or applied math (or both) and taking some biophysics electives.",

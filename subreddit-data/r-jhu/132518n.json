    "postText": "Hi, I will graduate on May 22nd. My lease ends on August 8. From May 23rd to August 8th, you only need to pay two months' rent. It's a 2B in the Marylander apartment, and I'm subletting one of the rooms. The rent is $780 a month plus electricity and internet (the total price is not more than 850 a month). My own Queen size bed and table and the other furniture will be kept for you.\n\nIf you are interested, you can send me a message directly.",

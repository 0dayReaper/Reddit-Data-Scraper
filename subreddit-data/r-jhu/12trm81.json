    "postText": "My cousin recently got accepted to both Peabody and UMich SMTD and he's having trouble deciding between the two (the tuition cost for both is similar). He applied to JHU as a computer music major and to UMich as Performing Arts Technology. He's always been interested in producing music, rapping, making beats, and singing, and in recent years he has decided that music is the path he wants to pursue. He isn't a huge fan of going to college but his parents wanted him to at least have a degree. Considering that, he wanted to go to Berklee the most because of its focus on contemporary music. \n\nIt would be really great if you guys could help my cousin out by giving some insights on what Peabody is like and whether it would be a good fit for him!",

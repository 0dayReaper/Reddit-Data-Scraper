It runs in the morning and in the afternoon.\n\nhttps://ts.jhu.edu/Shuttles/Shuttle_Schedules/FY23%20Bayview%20Schedule%20w%20Holidays.pdf\n\nIt may not show on Transloc, but it's usually on schedule. I take it all the time, it's the same blue jay shuttle they use for the night rides.  They'll usually have a sign propped up on the windshield with the name of the route.\n\nHope this helps.",

I generally commute to bayview using the Keswick express shuttle then the bayview one at east Baltimore. As their times are more clearer. Sorry about the other commentor",

    "postText": "I am a student at Hopkins who would like to begin attending church every Sunday. What would be the nearest Christian church that teaches sound theology? Like consistent with the Bible and the foundational teachings. \n\nI have noticed that with the rise of the progressive movement (no offense if you have a progressive ideology), there have been lots of interesting churches popping up with revolutionary, fantastical claims and ideas inconsistent with God and scripture. \n\nI am looking for a Protestant, evangelical ministry with teachings rooted in the Good Book. Preferably I would like one that believes in the sanctity of life, the value of marriage, and the importance of the union between man and woman. That type of church. (No offense if your views do not align with this) Is there anyone with a list of churches that fit this bill? Thank you very much in advance.\n\nEdit: my responses to commenters challenging my views are being silenced by the moderators. \n\nMy message that was deleted (my response to \u201cOh, dear, I know you all too well.\u201d) :\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but I really think you don\u2019t know what it means to be evangelical. \n\nEvangelicals take the Bible seriously and believe in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. The term \u201cevangelical\u201d comes from the Greek word euangelion, meaning \u201cthe good news\u201d or the \u201cgospel.\u201d Thus, the evangelical faith focuses on the \u201cgood news\u201d of salvation brought to sinners by Jesus Christ. (https://www.nae.org/what-is-an-evangelical/)\n\nAccording to Pew Research poles, Evangelicals currently make up a clear majority (55%) of all U.S. Protestants. (https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/05/12/chapter-1-the-changing-religious-composition-of-the-u-s/) \n\nAre you meaning to say that a majority of Protestant Christians are \u201canti-Christ\u201d? \n\nOf course, I do not mean to say that the validity of a belief is dependent on the number of believers, but I just want to give you a picture of the exact implications of your thinking.",

But I think it is necessary to draw a distinction between people who believe they follow scripture and those who actually follow scripture. I guess we can just agree to disagree.",

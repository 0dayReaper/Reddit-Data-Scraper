    "postText": "I am supposed to graduate this semester but I have suddenly been going through an extremely and excruciatingly difficult situation.  My professors already know some of the basics about my situation but I am very worried I cannot turn in some of my final papers which are over 20 pages long, some are due today, and I haven\u2019t started them.  I can\u2019t get incompletes I think because I\u2019m graduating.  What do I do.",

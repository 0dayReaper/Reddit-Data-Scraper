But I am assuming it does not prepare you as much for MCAT or med school as much.\n\nAnything in the medical or health field is a smart move because it is #1 for public health, so the degree will carry a lot of weight in the health field.\n\nWhatever you do, you have to love it.  Im sure you know you dont have to decide until 2nd year.  But I know its good to start of in the right direction.  I think you can explore both programs (poli sci or health).  And they have a lot of minor options too.\n\nDont forget to attend the webinar about majors Monday night.",

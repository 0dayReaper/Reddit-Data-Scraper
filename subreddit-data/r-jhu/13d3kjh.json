However, I don\u2019t exactly know how my grades figured into my application as I am switching into another field (I also took the GRE and did well). I did take a variety of classes, including a bunch of science courses before finally settling on German, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend overdoing it because graduate programs want to know that you know what you want to do. It helped that I participated in many related extracurricular activities like sustainability, teaching, and community outreach. \n\nIn my essay I mainly spoke about how my experiences with my extracurricular activities and being a first-generation, low-income student at a small liberal arts college led me to my decision to apply, as well as my later plans to pursue a PhD.\n\nJohns Hopkins is a diverse school that takes research very seriously, so I would say focus on your intended field (I assume it\u2019s microbiology) while making it clear that you\u2019re well-rounded\u2014not that you\u2019re indecisive, but that you are ready to face whatever life throws at you as a graduate student conducting research. You are only a sophomore, which gives you time to delve deeper into your field and make good connections with your professors (the more personal your recommendation letters, the better).",

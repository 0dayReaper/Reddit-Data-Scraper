Look at around August 20th being the start, with 19 or 20 as the move in date. \n\nHousing and meal stuff can be found here: \nhttps://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/community-living/university-housing/buildings-rates/\n\nOther academic info like registration will be sent later! Hope to see you at orientation :)",

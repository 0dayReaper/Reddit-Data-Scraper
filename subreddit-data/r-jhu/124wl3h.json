            "comment": "I'm going to focus on the second half of your question, as truthfully the majority of apartments near campus are quality places to live. Which you choose depends on your budget.\n\nUnlike other respondents on this thread, I am going to be unbiased about Baltimore. The city is, on the whole, quite safe! Most crime is concentrated in certain areas. In the area around Homewood, it is extremely safe to walk around during the day and generally also at night, though you should be careful as you would in any city. As for the rest of Baltimore City, the same rules generally apply - it is enough just being street smart and not walking alone at night in areas you don't know. There are many amazing things to do here, including museums, zoos and aquariums, clubs, concerts, parks, amazing restaurants, and much more, so I encourage you to not be afraid and explore! You'll be happy you did - I've come to love this city as if it were my hometown.\n\nOf course, like any city, some areas are riskier than others. You'll notice some places while you're here, but off the top of my head I usually avoid going alone or at night to Mid East, West Baltimore (the neighborhood, not the whole West side), Fairfield, and Sandtown-Winchester. Even those neighborhoods are usually safe to visit during the day - as long as you aren't flashing a $400 watch and stay alert. \n\nThe gist is that, though crime is a problem here, the media coverage and fear of it is disproportionate. Baltimore has a long and sordid past of racial discrimination and segregation, as well as systematic disinvestment today. Due to higher levels of poverty and Baltimore's predominantly Black population, the City is demonized in shows like The Wire and all over FOX News. That isn't a fair assessment, though! This is a vibrant and interesting city full of lovely people, and I'm excited for you to discover it for yourself.",

The rest of the places are pretty good, townhouses can be a little shady also utilities were always stupid high like for $600 rent 4 of us would have to pay $200 each as an average. Personally I thought the social was the best close to campus and big windows.",

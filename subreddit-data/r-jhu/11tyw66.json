    "postText": "Hello! I (F26) will be interning this summer in Laurel, MD at JHU APL and am looking for a room or apartment to sublet. My dates are flexible, but I would like to move in the week of May 21st or 28th ideally; however, I can move in as late as the first week of June. I would prefer to room with all women but am open to co-ed! If anyone knows of any people or resources (Facebook groups, groupme's, etc.) and could connect me that would be greatly appreciated!",

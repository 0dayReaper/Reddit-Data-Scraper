    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI check the SMILE website from time to time to look for the open front desk positions at the rec center and MSE (entrance facing the Beach). I never see it listed though, so I was wondering if the positions tend to fill up quickly or what the timeframe is when these positions typically open up again? Or is it listed on Handshake?\n\nI'm looking for a job where I can work but also study when there's down time and nothing needs attending to at the moment. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks! :)",

As you walk in (before the front security desk), it's a small office on the right.",

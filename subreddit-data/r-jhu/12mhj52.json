    "postText": "Hi! Sorry for the huge amount of unrelated questions; I would really appreciate any insight into any of them.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be accepted to JHU with BME (I love JHU and definitely am leaning towards it), as well as Cornell, CMU, GT, and Berkeley. I am *not* pre-med (yet lol). I know the JHU BME program speaks for itself, but how strong are the electrical/chemical engineering, computer science, applied math/stats, and physics programs at JHU, relative to these other schools? Is there a difference, either from the student or employer perspective?\n\nEven more importantly, how available/accessible are experiential learning opportunities at JHU, and how do they compare to Cornell and CMU? I know research is easy to find here, but are design teams easy to get into? How effective are the resources for finding internships, and are makerspaces/design labs and career planning resources any good?\n\nHow good are prospects for industry and grad school for engineering, and is the 3+1 BS/MS program for BME worth sacrificing a double undergrad major in BME + a broader degree like EE or CS if I can't fit both in my schedule? If anyone knows anything about any of these other schools, do they perform better in any of these categories than Hopkins? I know this is a lot, so any wisdom about any of this would be awesome.\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "One thing jhu definitely has over those schools is flexibility. You can easily take classes in other departments and double major here. Those other schools are a bit stronger for engineering and cs but jhu isn\u2019t much of a downgrade, still a top 20 engineering school. If you\u2019re interested in fields like EE or CS I would suggest double majoring instead of the 3+1 for bme. Not sure about industry prospects but grad school prospects are probably pretty good",

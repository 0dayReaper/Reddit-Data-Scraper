    "postText": "TLDR: Trying to decide between Johns Hopkins U and Vanderbilt U. (Stem major considering Neuroscience, Public health, genetics, bio, computer science and maybe double major, but not pre-med, both only expect me to pay less than 10k a year but Vandy\u2019s aid is more likely to change over the years and Hopkins pretty much assured me that they probably would keep my tuition low and give me a tech grant)\n\nBasically I was lucky to be accepted into both colleges. For reference, I am interested in doing either neuroscience, public health, genetics, bio or computer science and/or maybe double majoring. I actually live in Nashville, TN, so I feel like this makes me a little biased because I know some people going to Vandy (including my best friend) and I\u2019ve seen the school a bunch which makes the school (love the schools green spaces and dark academia aura) so it seems very comforting and easier to go pick Vandy. I went on a kind of rushed trip to Baltimore earlier this week and I feel like it was nicer than I was expecting, but I am still kind of conflicted. Johns Hopkins obviously has that name brand but the campus also feels a little bleak compared to other schools, maybe it\u2019s just because I haven\u2019t seen much inside plus I barely know anyone there, and this might just be me being anxious. I\u2019m wondering if I should prioritize academic, opportunities and the internships I would have access to at Hopkins, but I didn\u2019t have much fun in high school so I kind of long for the fun and social scene that seems to exists at schools like Vandy, but it might be at cost to the name brand that JHU offers (especially in the north east, which is where I think I want to settle). They are also both offering me similar amounts of money but Hopkins is giving me a little more, plus I have a really good relationship with my Hopkins financial aid advisor. I\u2019m gonna copy and paste my pros and cons list.\n\nJohns Hopkins Pros:\n\n-Prestige!!\n\n-1 hour train ride from D.C, 3 hour train ride NYC.\n\n-I want to settle in the northeast, might know people in the northeast\n\n-Might have better chance at Ivy League grad school or Work\n\n-New experience far from home\n\n-Flying is lowkey fun!\n\n-know some folks in the northeast (could hang with family and have fun)\n\n-new beginning, getting out of my comfort zone\n\n-much better ranking in what I\u2019m interested in (public health, neuroscience, computer science, genetics, bio)\n\n-new student center might be cool\n\n-historical value\n\n-research and network opportunities\n\n-feel very proud to rep it\n\nJohns Hopkins cons:\n\n-Baltimore (supposedly dangerous and kinda lame) and my safety\n\n-Social life seems kind of dead, student center not coming till sophomore year\n\n-Paying to come home every time\n\n-dorms look kinda ugly (still trying to find more pictures of it) and campus is less homey\n\n-\u201ccut throat/competitive\u201d environment\n\n-bleak food options (not nearly as many dining halls and options as vandy)\n\n-seems too stem and med focused\n\n-don\u2019t have any close friends going\n\n-basically kicked off campus upperclassmen years to find outside housing\n\n-much harder to bring my car\n\nVanderbilt Pros:\n\n-Beautiful campus\n\n-Social scene is supposedly lit\ud83d\udd25\n\n-known greatly in the south\n\n-good food options around\n\n-I know people going who are cool (like my best friend, she\u2019s really special to me)\n\n-lots of major options\n\n-could bring my car sooner and more conveniently\n\n-Fun event like sports games, carnivals, festivals, Nashville concerts.\n\n-get to feel close to campus in upperclassman years with nice on campus housing\n\n-i think I\u2019m cool wit my financial advisor\n\n-the student body feels very connected (all freshman live on commons)\n\n-Home is 30 mins away if anyone needs anything.\n\nVanderbilt cons:\n\n-Not AS prestigious as Johns Hopkins\n\n-Might get tired of Vandy and Nashville\n\n-students seem less intellectually curious and more like party folks\n\n-less diverse\n\n-much lower ranking for each major\n\n-very expensive if I lose aid\n\n-might not be as known outside of southeast region, which will affect networking.",

Almost all of the worries you have really don\u2019t exist on campus. I love Baltimore, there\u2019s tons of stuff to do in the city and places nearby. If you know where to go and where not to it\u2019s totally safe minus the typical petty crimes you have in any major city (for the most part, stuff does occasionally happen). Social life here is really what you make of it. If you want a party scene frats and sororities totally exist and are accessible and if you prefer just hanging at home with close friends that\u2019s also totally acceptable. The lack of the student center does suck though. The dorms are actually great here, there\u2019s much more of a collaborative environment than a cutthroat one. Food was meh but they changed provider and is apparently much better now (I\u2019m no longer on a meal plan so I can\u2019t personally say) The school is stem focused but all of our humanities programs are incre\u00edble and ik tons of non stem people who are here and love it and help diversify the academic interests on campus. Lastly living off campus as an upperclassman is kinda awesome. It\u2019s cheaper, you have more autonomy and more space and all of the off campus living options are super super close to campus. Idk anyone more than a 10 minute walk from campus and campus isn\u2019t huge so it\u2019s like a max 20 minute walk to class. Hope this helps. Obviously it\u2019s only my personal perspective and feel free to dm me with other questions.",

I do think I\u2019m just being a little bit anxious for no reason, JHU is obviously a great option, it\u2019s just very outside of my comfort zone and very far from home, also kind of feels like the opposite of Vandy. I do have some follow up questions if you don\u2019t mind\u2014 do you guys have any fun events going on at campus or nearby (like concerts and festivals)? Also how did you know Hopkins was right for you and were you scared?",

                            "comment": "Yeah. So in terms of what\u2019s going on on campus there is stuff but tbh it could be better. We have a few speaker series, an orchestra, acapella, and a few yearly events (hoptoberfest, lighting of the quads, and spring fair). There\u2019s tons of stuff going on in the surrounding area though. If you like football and or baseball we have super easy access to where the ravens and orioles play. There\u2019s tons of museums and Ive been to a decent number of concerts and symphonies. There\u2019s a lot of small music venues with really cool niche stuff and we just opened a new stadium for bigger names (ex. Queen is playing there later in the year). Other than that there\u2019s tons to explore in Maryland and we have super easy access to DC so there\u2019s always stuff to do. Also personally I knew Hopkins had the programs I wanted and the people there felt like the right people for me. And ofc I was scared, going to college is a scary thing especially going to a school with the reputation hopkins has about being cutthroat and stuff (which let me say again is totally unequivocally untrue). But at the same time ik Hopkins was the place I wanted to spend the next 4 years of my life and I have met the most incredible people here, had an amazing time, and an amazing education that will prepare me well for what\u2019s to come in life",

            "comment": " think that the cons you have listed are there because you're not as familiar with Hopkins, so I'll try to shed some truth on the things you've mentioned. Baltimore is genuinely not as dangerous as people make it out to be, but you'll hear different stories from different people. Overall, if it's a concern for you, I would just recommend you to act in any way you would being in a larger city. The social life isn't dead since people are open to hanging out and making new friends all the time. I think if you're looking for a party school this isn't the place to be, but it's definitely fun to be here and the people you'll meet will also be looking to 'break the stereotype of Hopkins being socially dead.' The cut throat/competitive environment stems from the fact that this is a predominantly Premed school, but the truth of it is that since it is a premed school, everyone is helping each other out in terms of the classes they're taking. Everyone knows that everyone is struggling and we're all just trying to get through it together. I'm not sure if you had the food here during your visit, but I wouldn't really consider the food here 'bleak.' Nolans is a pretty good place to go for pasta/stir-fry, FFC has good fish and meat options, Levering is like a courtyard full of different cuisines (asian, american, mexican, etc.), and we also have a series of cafe's around campus that have yummy options. I agree that Hopkins is pretty STEM/Premed focused, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. You can come to Hopkins for humanities and have a great time because you'll be having more one on one with professor's and less competition for resources, and if you're here for STEM, well you have all the resources you could want. Also, Hopkins doesn't 'kick you out' in that they have you fend for yourself and it'll be really hard to find a place to live after 2nd year. There are a bunch of student apartments like the Social, 9E, the Academy, or you could even rent a rowhouse with your friends and live together. These are 'unofficial' Hopkins dorms for upperclassmen, plus it gives you the push you need to be able to look for these leases like how you will when you're older (basically, they help you learn independence). Also, no one will be using their car here. It's a city, so everything is within a reasonable walk or bus or train ride away. Having a car here would mean more money, and people would use you for your car anyways. Also, if you really want a car, then you could always rent a Zipcar (which we have a parking lot full of right next to the Freshman dorms). I do think that having a car in any college setting is unnecessary, so I would recommend against this going to Vandy, too. You would face the same issue of parking/cost and people befriending you just because you have a car. Anyways, happy decision making, and hopefully this helped.",

Career wise, yeah Hopkins seems like the smartest choice, but I also want to indulge in the school spirit I avoided in highschool, like games, festivals, maybe a little bit of partying.

You'll be living in the safest area of baltimore even when you are off campus (assuming you don't move to the south of campus). Baltimore has a lot of history and charm that many hopkins students fail to see. If you really wanted your car then it shouldn't be a problem but i would recommend waiting until you're living off campus. If you like art, music, history, nature, community events, or activism/volunteering Baltimore (and maryland) has all of that. Hopkins events can be a little lame but there are so many clubs to join that it balances out usually. Also, there is quite a bit of school pride from JHU students...except maybe for sports lol. Lastly, the campus is really gorgeous. The buildings vary on the inside but the outside and the quada/gardens are really great! Plus the peabody library is a sight to behold. \n\nRegarding majors. Hopkins is very stem focused but it also has a very rich humanities element too. A lot of stem students minor in a humanities. The philosophy department is is becoming world renowned. many of the humanities departments are kinda small but really great! There's a lot of interesting humanities courses to take. There is also a small archeology museum in gilman. \n\nAll that being said, life is what you make of it here. If you have any disabilities then it might be an uphill battle with some aspects of hopkins life. The night shuttles are somewhat reliable but  the wait time kinda sucks. Grades really get to you if you're not careful. Never priorize grades over your health. Food is really meh but there's some decent places within walking distance. I never was in the dorms but i don't here great things (but hey you only have to be in them for 2 years)\n\nFor me: Hopkins is amazingly diverse. I love meeting so many people that are coming from different walks of life. I've formed close bonds with the people in my clubs. I've learned how to take bad grades in stride and to appreciate my hard work even when it doesn't amount to an A. I have an incredible job on campus were i work with amazing people. Sometimes I'd like teachers that are better at lecturing but the colloquiums that i get to attend here are super interesting. I've learned to be self-sufficient and because i had to live off campus I learned how to use the money I have in efficient and beneficial ways. I've done things that i never thought to even try before here at hopkins. I feel like i will leave as a more well-rounded person!",

So hopkins currently holds more prestige and is generally considered to be on par with many Ivy League schools (though it is not ivy league ofc). Vanderbilt seems to have a better student life compared to JHU so if you're ranking that then yea, hopkins isn't as good. Hopkins is really good at providing students the ability to network and idk what that opportunity is like at Vanderbilt. If you want to flaunt the name on your degree, both schools are impressive but JHU really wows ppl andis recognized internationally.

The campus doesn\u2019t have a great feel to it and Baltimore is not the type of city you just go out and about like you would with Nashville. I have a few friends who go to JHU and they are constantly stressed with how competitive it is. I don\u2019t get that from anyone who goes to Vanderbilt \ud83e\udd37",

I\u2019m leaning towards vandy but my only concern atp is that Hopkins has guaranteed cheap tuition despite possible financial changes, vandy can\u2019t guarantee that and the fact that Hopkins is technically more known for my possible majors. I also think I want to settle in the northeast so it would be harder to network from vandy.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a recent admit to JHU BME and I have a few questions about double-majoring. Any insight at all would be really appreciated.\n\nIs double-majoring, especially in two majors in Whiting (BME + EE/CS/AMS specifically), manageable in terms of stress/workload? Is it possible to balance such a double major with design teams and research?\n\nAlso, two unrelated broad questions, if anyone has experience here: how strong is the electrical engineering program, and is JHU collaborative at all?\n\nThank you so much, any advice at all would be awesome!",

BME is almost like a survey of engineering, but the real work will always be done by someone with a ton of experience in something (eg. An EE or CS or AMS primary major)  q",

                    "comment": "Agree with points said here too, bme was a great way to make friends and study with with some very talented people who I probably wouldn\u2019t have otherwise met, but a major reason I noticed for doubling amongst my friends and myself personally was to obtain dedicated skills to be recruitable for industry. Bme (at least as of a few years ago, can\u2019t speak to its latest iteration) generalizes to its detriment and if you aren\u2019t mindful of finding a focus (either with a secondary major or with a very intentional set of electives + out of the classroom experiences) you can easily become a jack of many master of none as stated above.",

            "comment": "Double majoring with CS is very doable with the biomedical data science focus area. AMS would require a couple more classes (notably taking lin alg/diff eq and prob/stat separately as opposed to the combined single semester classes) and some other requirements that I don\u2019t remember off the top of my head. I haven\u2019t heard of many people pursuing BME/EE but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible. I would talk to your advisors and upperclassmen when you get on campus before deciding whether it\u2019s really worth pursuing (since there are somewhat EE related focus areas in BME). \n\nJHU is very collaborative generally but it will depend on your peers and professors you interact with. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "Have posted this before in a previous bme/ee discussion thread but imo: It\u2019s not a lot of extra credits if you plan for it early and is nice to have on job applications. It also gives you a bit of flexibility in applying to jobs outside of the traditional bme sphere. Doing a secondary of a BS in EE is a little bit more involved especially with BME having so much adjustment in their curriculum the past few years, but is doable. Alternatively,  if you plan classes out well and do a secondary of a BA in EE, I think it\u2019s only one or two extra classes if you take all your focus area bme classes in the ECE department. The main different between the two paths is in the lower level classes you take and whether you satisfy both departments freshman/sophomore requirements or just BMEs (which people traditionally do as their primary bc of how admission works) There\u2019s often 2-3 BME/EE doubles each year. I would recommend reaching out to a student a year or two ahead of you (the undergraduate coordinators can help you find other students if needed) and asking them to share their schedule with you. It should be a solid foundation for when to take which courses and the feedback is really helpful.\n\nTLDR: plenty of bme\u2019s each year (anecdotally especially ones who are planning on going into industry) double major within whiting. It\u2019s not terrible if you plan ahead and utilize double counting requirements as much as you can.",

            "comment": "BME is tedious because of how wide and shallow it goes; quite a useless major on its own, so if you want to graduate with employable skills or have proficiency for something research-oriented I would almost say a double major is a requisite (I dont think I learned anything particularly valuable other than a lot of facts about biology in the BME sequence alone)\n\nFortunately it's the best dept for research, which if you want grad school or med school will help you immensely and the classes will give you some foundation for that (they are basically really wide survey courses, so you will get a good sense of what's out there research wise), and it is the easiest major I can think of off top of head to double major with (the dept is, or at least was when I was in iy, extremely good about working with students' skillsets they want, has a massive list of courses that will double count for your upper levels, and most importantly that list was/probably still is FLEXIBLE in that courses unlisted but that you can make an argument are essential to your skills as a BME you can get to count anyways. My advisor helped me facilitate this process for a course that wasn't listed, but felt like it should have been). \n\nFor your interested double majors think ab the DS focus area; most of the core and upper levels for CS and AMS are already written into the acceptable BME upper levels to double count; it should wind up being ~4-8 extra classes tops for CS or AMS anyways, which if you plan early, basically will just entail filling your electives over the 4 years with the second major's requisites\n\nWhiting is extraordinarily collaborative; literally nobody would finish the homeworks otherwise. CS remarkably so; most homeworks for core courses the days before a homework is due, the CS building is filled with students discussing the assignments. BME maybe a little less, but pretty much every homework again students are sketching out and discussing the homeworks in their \"friend group\" leading up to writing their solutions for most assignments. On the other hand, the pre med courses are not particularly collaborative in my experience.",

    "postText": "Hi all, mostly writing this as a rant but also want to see if I'm the hypersensitive one for finding this really annoying and also somewhat controlling? Enjoy some lukewarm tea in the midst of studying for finals &lt;3\n\nI'm a student at JHSPH and one of my professors this term communicates solely through phone call and absolutely refuses to answer any questions over email. Keep in mind that this course is entirely online and asynchronous. She wants us to call her for our questions to be answered at odd times (past 10pm on Friday nights, Saturday/Sunday mornings, etc.) She also claimed that she \"didn't have the time to write everything out through email\" and that \"it would *have* to be by phone\". The first time around, I went along with it because I needed my paper topic approved in order to get started on it. After our phone call, she sent an email summarizing our conversation, immediately proving her previous statement wrong, but whatever, I got my topic approved and could start writing.\n\nHowever, recently, I asked if her lack of feedback comments on my first paper was intentional or an error on my end. To this, she told me to call her (providing her availability for Sunday morning), and that she would go through my paper and give me feedback on the call. I immediately flagged this as strange, as if she *did* have comments on my work but deliberately chose not to include them on my returned paper. I realize that students aren't entitled to anything besides a grade, but this behavior seemed really weird to me. Additionally, this professor claims that the reason she's so insistent on meeting with us by phone is because she's so \"invested in our success\". She also told me that she hopes to use my paper as an example for next year's class because she thinks that the paper topic is unique, but she hasn't even seen the final product and from the beginning of the writing process, it felt like she was trying to micromanage me and craft my paper into an example that she wanted to use.\n\nWith all that said, she feels like a controlling person to me. She comes across as disrespectful of and entitled to others' time, as she provides her availability (which are brief periods of time at odd hours or on the weekend) and expects me to find the time to speak with her in order to get the information that she's withholding from me. I'm going to grit my teeth and put up with her for the rest of the term, but I just wanted to get insight from others about whether or not I'm being unreasonable by feeling peeved off by this woman lol. Thanks for reading through all this! Also, I would highly recommend not taking this class (for many reasons), so if you'd like to know what course, feel free to DM!\n\ntl;dr: Professor withholds feedback and will only provide it through phone calls with her that she insists happens on late nights or weekend mornings. AITA for finding her annoying and controlling?",

I know the term is almost over but clearly this is something she\u2019s ok with doing and will continue doing until someone says something. Do your other classmates experience this too? Are you being singled out? \nAlso mention your discomfort on course evaluation maybe?",

I wish I had more recommendations for what to do, but I do want to confirm that you are definitely not over reacting I would feel the exact same way if it were me!!",

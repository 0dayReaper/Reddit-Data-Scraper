    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI will be studying at Hopkins starting this Fall and am looking at apartment options (studio or 1 bedroom). Can anyone lived/living at the Social share candid reviews of what it's like living there?\n\nIn addition, I would appreciate reviews on the nearby apartments as well (e.g., the Marylander, Hopkins House, etc.). Cost (preferably less than $1600) and walking distance to JHU are not a problem.\n\nThank you!",

The Social is the *best* by far. The most clean, most natural lighting, and no heating/cooling issues. The only issue here is the package delivery, you have to sort through heaps of packages to get to yours in the Mail room (hopefully they have fixed this since last semester!). Also you may need to budget 5-10 extra minutes to walk to class. At night though, you can take the Blue Jay shuttle back home. All in all, really comfortable, hardwood floors, nice appliances, but at a more expensive price. There's also an awesome gym here!\n\nI had to move out of Marylander due to poor water pressure and cockroach issues (I unfortunately got an apartment next to the trash room on my floor, which was always overflowing). I lived in Hopkins House, and no complaints.. it was just too far to walk to my classes. I moved out of Baltimorean due to water issues, smells/dustiness, and very (very!) un-friendly management.\n\nHope this helps ;)",

            "comment": "Homewood? I suggest looking for a unit in a row home, anywhere between 29th to 32nd Charles to N Calvert, 30th and above on Guilford. Those are significantly cheaper and better value for money than a lot of high-rises near campus. Alternatively, you can find a place in Mt. Vernon (on Charles or St. Paul). The Mt Vernon JHMI bus stop northbound is in a very convenient and safe area and these buses run every 15 minutes. You'll get from the Mt. Vernon stop to the JHMI bus stop by Barnes &amp; Noble in 10ish minutes.\n\nI really am suggesting you do a row home situation. I'm renting a newly-renovated 2-bedroom row home unit with my girlfriend for 1,550 a month \\~5 minutes from campus. This includes water, heating, and 1 parking space. Try to get a feel for your potential landlord though -- our landlord had his own team for repairs so I was comfortable with renting from an independent home owner.",

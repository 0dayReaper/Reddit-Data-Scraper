    "postText": "Hi! I'm interested in joining JHUs Online Applied and Computational Mathematics Program. I would like to enroll over the summer, however I noticed that there were no courses from the department listed on the course catalogue. Is this because it's only January or are they just not offering any EN courses this summer? I looked at previous summer offerings and it always seems to have been offered.",

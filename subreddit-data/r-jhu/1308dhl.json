    "postText": "**Intended major: Mechanical Engineering**\n\nAdditional Context: Hoping to go into industry, but interested in going to graduate school and getting a phd\n\n**Johns Hopkins University**  \nPros:\n\n* Amazing research opportunities and funding for projects, will definitely help with grad school admissions\n* Small class size, easy access to professors\n* Lots of academic flexibility in choosing majors and double majoring --- I know someone who got to dive into a really cool field of study as an undergrad because he was able to double major\n* Hands-on courses\n* T10 uni lol, but I'm super unclear about whether that makes a big difference for graduate school and jobs (see more on this at the end of my post)\n\nCons:\n\n* 80-90k tuition (no scholarship, but my parents are willing to pay for either school)\n* Super med focused?\n* Really academically rigorous, but I'm willing to put in that effort\n* When I visited, albiet during midterm season, there wasn't really any \"buzz\" on campus -- it was weirdly quieter than any other college I've seen, including ones with similar class sizes. It could be that it's just harder to see as an outsider. I definitely do think that there's a social life if you try to find one, and that things like house parties exist at JHU\n* In Baltimore: On top of kind of quiet on campus, it didn't really feel like there were many places nearby that... had people. I went to Mount Vernon on a Sunday afternoon after being recommended by a bunch of people, but it was literally empty lmao. While JHU is close to Washington DC (and as much as I love exploring), realistically I don't think I'll be going very often.\n\n**UCLA**  \nPros:\n\n* Beautiful campus and weather, so much life on campus\n* Smack in LA. I think that there's a type of vitality and inspiration that comes with being in a lively city with many places nearby to explore.\n* In-state tuition (\\~40k) + Alumni Scholarship (Like 1.5k a year, not really sure what other perks the scholarship has)\n* Closer to home\n* Work hard play hard culture\n\nCons:\n\n* Large public school --&gt; more competitive research opportunities?\n* I'm struggling to find a strong impression of what the mechanical engineering program or academics are like at UCLA, which leads me to believe that it's great, but more standard\n* Mechanical engineering classes are all really theoretical rather than hands-on, prototyping classes aren't amazing from what I've heard \n* I've heard that the university invests more in the graduate program than the undergraduate program\n* Class selection is kind of based on luck, could either be easy-ish to get your classes or super hard\n\n**Other notes:**\n\nIn terms of academics, I think that JHU is probably a bit better, but that UCLA doesn't fall too far behind, although I'm super unsure about this. It feels like I'm making a decision between having a really strong academic experience versus a strong academic experience with a social life. Here are a few specific questions that I think would give me a lot of clarity:\n\n* Is there a substantial difference between name/prestige/entrance into graduate school between either school? Specifically, is JHU's higher ranking and academic experience worth giving up being in the city?\n* Where do you guys (JHU Students) find daily inspiration, if that makes any sense? Especially for people who like to explore, where do you guys go to feel alive again after a heck ton of studying?  \n\nThank you guys so much!!",

            "comment": "Amazing job at getting into these schools! As a current Hopkins student, let me try to shed some truth on the cons list you've built for Hopkins! I wouldn't say that Hopkins is super med focused, but it definitely is super STEM focus, which I think would be a really good opportunity as a MechE major because that means that opportunities and resources will always be falling into your hands. However, you're very much right in that there's a lot of flexibility, so if you ever want to pad your GPA a little bit or just take classes for fun, our humanities department is so one on one and personalized that it'll be a really enjoyable experience. I would say that Hopkins is academically rigorous but it's also really manageable with the effort it seems you're going to be put in. A lot of people I know are in super hard classes/majors but manage to go out to parties/darties during the weekday and still go out on the weekend and still have time to do their homework and be successful. What 'midterm' season were you talking about? Because our 'midterms' usually refer to monthly exams or so rather than a dedicated period of back to back midterms. If you visited during unfortunate weather, people usually like to cozy up inside buildings rather than come out, but as we've gotten more sun and such a lot of people have been staying outside and enjoying the pleasant weather, it's definitely much more buzz-y when the weather is nice and sometimes it's so lively that it's difficult to find a place to sit outside with your own friends. Honestly, you wouldn't have to look too hard to find a social life because a lot of people are very aware of the 'dead social scene' concept and make active efforts to counteract that, so a lot of people are open to being social and such. I'm not sure why Mount Vernon was empty on the day you went, but usually it's super cute, and also Bmore has a lot of like cool places to go to. Some of my favs have included the restaurant neighborhood scene in Inner Harbor, the seasonal Haunted Houses, an escape room, Hampden (literally streets full of things to do) and overall, Bmore is fun when you actually have time to explore it and such. \n\nI also agree with your cons for UCLA (in accordance to my friend who goes to UCLA). The research opps would def be more competitive, plus since it's a public school you'll have so many more people to compete over resources and opportunities overall. I do think it's a very important thing to note about the class selection thing because you are correct in that it could be very difficult sometimes to get the classes you have, while Hopkins kind of being more accessible with classes. However, the cost of attendance should also be a really big factor you consider because of the cost of attendance it might cost to go to grad school. The tuition cost you'd be paying with Hopkins doesn't necessarily include the transportation costs it would include to travel back and forth for breaks and/or summer housing costs if you choose to stay for the summer (but some things are definitely cheaper overall in MD compared to CA as someone who's from CA). \n\n**Is there a substantial difference between name/prestige/entrance into graduate school between either school? Specifically, is JHU's higher ranking and academic experience worth giving up being in the city?**  \n\\- I wouldn't really say there's that big of a difference because Hopkins and UCLA are both insanely prestigious schools, but I also wouldn't say that you're giving up being in a city by attending Hopkins. I think that the social scene you're looking for can easily be found in Bmore and Hopkins in general, and although you won't be visiting DC much, it's similar to saying you won't be leaving the UCLA bubble that much as well since LA over all is an insanely large city, and the county covers even more. \n\n  \n**Where do you guys (JHU Students) find daily inspiration, if that makes any sense? Especially for people who like to explore, where do you guys go to feel alive again after a heck ton of studying?**  \n\\- I feel inspiration from my friends honestly, they really do motivate me to be a better person with more drive and such. I think I also really enjoy some of my Professors because they really care so much about their students and our grades and try to make our lives a little bit easier by not purposefully making their classes hard. Anyways, to answer the second part of your question, I like to dedicate a whole day of the week to just hanging out with friends and exploring the city. Last semester, we made it a goal to go out into the city and find something new each week and it was so fun and relaxing and really refreshing after a whole week of studying and such. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I hope this helped some how! Happy decision making!",

            "comment": "Regarding grad school admissions: UCLA vs JHU is a draw in prestige, but access to profs and research opportunities is a huge, huge factor in grad admissions.  The easiest way into a top grad program is by having research experience with a well known prof (who then writes a good LOR for you), assuming you have decent grades.  This will be way easier to acquire at JHU.",

            "comment": "To be honest, I'd go with the cheaper option and where you might experience more life outside school. Hopkins is as intense as it sounds -- more because of the amount of workload and pacing rather than the difficulty level. Granted, I'm in the grad program and we do a term system. \n\nI do agree that research experience significantly helps grad school application but I think you'll have opportunities for that in UCLA too. As for prestige, I took my undergrad for free abroad and still got in all my grad apps so I wouldn't stress about that as long as you have research experience. Try to get some publications in if you can. \n\nNot the biggest fan of Baltimore in general. It's not terrible actually, people are alright, and there is a sense of community for sure. However, I do feel that the concern over safety is warranted. If you have a car, you'll be fine though.",

It\u2019s a very large research university and there are also lots of similar opportunities in SoCal. The job/student-project theme probably would be even better than JHU (just a guess) since there are a lot more students interested completely different things.\n\nAccess to lecturing profs, TAs, educational resources would be the main concern because it\u2019s a large public school. But at the end of the day, lots of undergraduate study is still self oriented and many students wouldn\u2019t utilize these resources. Even though a class could have a few hundreds of students, I don\u2019t think it will be too hard to interact with instructors.",

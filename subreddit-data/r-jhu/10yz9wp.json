    "postText": "We recently moved next to homewood campus and need to sell a bunch of stuff on craigslist. **Any advice on a safe and accessible location near campus to meet with buyers?** Was thinking the parking lot of MOM's organic market but still don't know the area particularly well. Have never had an issue with craigslist exchanges but always want to play it safe.",

            "comment": "34th street between N. Charles and St. Paul could be a good spot. It's easy to find or give directions to, the entrance to the Wolman and McCoy residence halls are on either side of the street (mid-block) and there is room for someone to temporarily park (or double-park if needed)...there is always plenty of foot traffic and it's has a constant JH Public Safety presence. The sidewalk along there and of course the street itself is public property, so I don't think you'd run into any issues with being \"on campus\" per se.",

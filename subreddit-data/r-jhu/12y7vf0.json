    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to sublease my house in Charles village on St Paul St over the summer from the months of June to end of August. The house and room is fully furnished and shared with three other roommates. It includes a dishwasher, washer and dryer, a garage and many other appliances. The room comes with a dresser, L-shaped desk, and full sized bed with a nightstand. Pictures of the room and house can be provided on request!\n\nRent is $825/month with the garage or $775/month without it. Utilities include water, gas, electricity and internet, and typically are about $50-$75/month in total. The location is very close to campus (about a 2 minute walk to the Beach).",

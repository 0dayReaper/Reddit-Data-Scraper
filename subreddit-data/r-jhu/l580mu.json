    "postText": "I don't know why im posting this, but right now on campus I feel like I am slowly suffocating. I haven't made and friends yet and everyone seems to be In these huge groups already. Everything seems to be so cliquey and this seems too often to be based on specific demographics, with there not being much people of my background. I've been trying to connect in my job search with alumni and they are all so cold and it seems they also connect better with people who either where in the same frat as them or are also of a similar demographic and I have to compete with other people who are already looped in. \n\nI honestly feel so drained and it seems like there are so many obstacles and that's all my life consist of right now. It's honestly getting harder and hard to not start crying when Im just walking somewhere.  I don't know what to do from here besides stick it out, but it's getting harder and harder to not drown.",

I\u2019m not gonna lie, Hopkins is cliquey and I understand why. People from similar backgrounds find it easier to bond and don\u2019t really see or maybe care abt the impact it has on people who aren\u2019t of that background/don\u2019t have anyone of their background around. I\u2019m both glad that people of these demographics have found a safe space to thrive here, but also frustrated like you. My only advice is to push forward tho. Try to put yourself out there even if it\u2019s not your comfort zone. Initiate conversations, ask your classmates if they want to study together. The people in the huge cliquey groups don\u2019t do it intentionally (for the most part), they just feel safer around their own. So it sucks but i feel like that leaves the burden on you to show you\u2019re also a safe person to hang out with. Take this advice with a grain of salt ofc, but at least in my experience I have found these groups to be reluctant to interact with other people unless approached first. Good luck and definitely feel free to pm me if you want!",

Hopefully, when (albeit virtual) clubs and activities start up this can help your mind rest at ease a little better. I'm not going to lie, until then it might be difficult. Calling home is helpful, doing things you love, focusing on your schoolwork, journalling.  I don't know if you are religious, but I will be praying for you because again, I know this feeling absolutely SUCKS. Also, feel free to PM and reach out.",

Moving away from home and living on your own for the first time is so difficult, it can feel so isolating and bleak, but I promise that it really does get better. It gets easier to ask someone to get food together, or ask someone to study together. It gets easier to eat alone too! Trust me, I skipped lunches freshman fall because I was so scared of eating alone. Reach out to, and stay in contact with, family and friends from home. I'm sure some of your friends from high school will be feeling similar feelings, talk to them about it or talk to them about something completely unrelated to distract yourself and keep busy.\n\nAlso, you have so much time to worry about jobs and networking, try not to add too much to your plate all at once. Try to focus on one big issue at a time, it seems the most pressing issue right now is adjusting to college, which is a massive task on its own, the pandemic makes everything harder of course. Figuratively, if you're drowning in a lake, you're not going to be focusing on drying yourself off, you need to focus on staying afloat first. \n\nI hope you find some good things to focus on soon, my inbox (or however this website works lol) will always be open if you or anyone else ever wants to talk :)",

Like day one people were already hanging out in large groups and I felt like I was being left out or doing something wrong since everyone was new but already met so many people. AMR is quite lonesome as there aren\u2019t many people per hallway(3 people in my hallway) and it can be hard to meet new people. But I\u2019m sure as classes happen and time passes new people will be met. If you ever want someone to talk to feel free to PM and reach out.",

I believe most of the time they want referrals to my employer. I personally will not give a referral to someone that I cannot speak to their technical skills. \n\nI volunteered for a mock interview night once last year, but the event got cancelled because of weather. I legitimately wanted to help students prepare for professional interviews. For some reason the alumni network gave out my personal contact info, and I got smashed with emails to my personal email account and a flood of random LinkedIn requests. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be cold. If a student wants to have a legit chat about careers and industry, that\u2019s fine. However I find it\u2019s almost entirely students looking for direct referrals with little interest in advice or guidance.\n\nBest of luck. Stay the course.",

If you're not comfortable approaching someone just tryhard in a class and have someone approach you asking for help; that's a great way to make friends.\n\n**Troll reply**: This is like the third post where a freshman complained abt being quarantined. We get it, you're extroverts and you need to shake hands with Obama otherwise you'd be labelled as a disgrace, just calm tf down.",

I'm a freshman on campus for the first time this semester. The first couple of days I was feeling a lot like you are. Fortunately, I've learned over the years how to be alone so it didn't take me all that long to just settle with it. I do have one friend though and it's been super helpful to be able to talk to at least one person, so like many others I'll extend the invitation to PM me! And if you ever want someone to just walk with, I'd be down. I hope all the comments here have been encouraging enough to keep you floating. We're all swimming along side :)",

If you want pm me and we can go for a meal sometime. Also try to connect in PILOT or your classes. People leave meeting to play smash or going for a food together. Also consider joining an extracurricular of something you enjoy like an improv group or making rockets! People want to meet and help you, so try to enjoy the time alone and the time with others :)",

To me, it felt like everyone was best friends with everyone else a week into school and I hadn\u2019t even gotten my bearings. But then, I spoke to some other people and found out that tons of people were in the same boat, just trying to find cool people to hang with. Even if they were out with people, few people were truly as close as they appeared. On top of just the normal freshman difficulties you\u2019re dealing with a pandemic where you can\u2019t meet up with new people. The thing that worked best for me was to realize that no matter how people seem, people are probably more similar to you than you might think. For me, just knowing that was really comforting, since it meant I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling lonely and bad at making friends. It\u2019s also important to reach out randomly (which I\u2019m still really bad at but whenever I push myself I\u2019m pleasantly surprised). I mean what\u2019s the worst that can happen? They say no? Nothing actually happens but for me I guess I\u2019m so afraid of rejection that it\u2019s hard to reach out, so I hope you won\u2019t fall into the same trap. It\u2019s a bit different this year but I think the cliques look more cohesive from the outside than they really are",

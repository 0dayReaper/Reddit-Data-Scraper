    "postText": "Hey everyone,\nI was wondering if anyone here has done the systems engineering master\u2019s degree (engineering for professionals). I\u2019m offered a Project Course path, which is just 1 semester or a Thesis path, which spans 2 semesters. Curious which one you did and why? Which one is more manageable with a high job workload? Which one gives you more out of it? \n\nThanks for the help!",

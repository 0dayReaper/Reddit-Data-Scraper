Usually read a bit on their lab website to see their areas of study and express interest + CV/resume in an email. Just spend a minute or two reviewing for the initial email. You can go more in-depth if they offer to meet. \n\nOtherwise getting involved with non medical service I think is really powerful. Some great programs I did are tutorial project and thread. I found myself talking about them a bunch on interviews and they are honestly so fun to do.\n\nFor leadership, TAing if you can is a double whammy of leadership + education. Also being a Pilot leader is good. Otherwise the usual, leading a club or a project.",

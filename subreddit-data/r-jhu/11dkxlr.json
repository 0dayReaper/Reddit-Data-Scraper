Do people have social lives or is everyone in the lab 24/7? Are people friendly? Is everyone depressed?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d some of the things I\u2019ve heard are genuinely horrifying and it\u2019s making me not want to accept\u2026. anyone have any insight on this? Pls help I would love to go to Hopkins but I also don\u2019t want to be miserable for 7 years",

            "comment": "I'm going to say that it's very PI dependent. I would first verify that there's at least 3 labs that align with your interests and reach out to current grad students in those labs. Ask them about the culture in the lab, their relationship with their PI and how do they feel about their decision.\n\nI went to Hopkins for undergrad and I love Baltimore and Hopkins overall. I had amazing friends and I really loved the research opportunities. But there were less than 2 labs in the research area I was interested in for grad school and the students in those labs were miserable. I didn't want to stay in my undergrad lab because I was interested in going into a different field. So even though I could have done grad school there, I chose a lab that had a PI that I felt I could get along with. \n\nA PhD is long and your experience is highly dependent on your lab and your relationship with your PI. In undergrad, if you don't get along with a professor it might not affect you as much because you're taking so many credits and are doing so many things, that one professor's interaction won't affect you as much. But that's not true of a PhD.\n\nThat being said, I've had classmates stay at Hopkins for their PhD and really love it, especially if they got along really well with their PI. And I've also had friends have terrible experiences and really regret the life and the whole stressful experience or the expectations of certain PIs.\n\nSo, it's very dependent. Please try to gauge the lab culture of the labs you're interested in before committing.",

It's not a typical department -- it's four or five departments standing on each others' shoulders in a trench coat. There is no department culture per se, because we have little in common in terms of either shared interests or shared spaces. But it's not miserable, just really fragmented. There's tons of opportunity to mix and match smaller communities however suits you (requires initiative). We don't all work horrible long hours -- most ppl I've spoken with think the BME undergrads work harder than us. Fellow BME PhD's are generally very nice and will help you out if you reach out to them.",

            "comment": "Hiya! I\u2019m a 2nd year in BME PhD, echoing that it\u2019s going to be very PI/lab dependent. Were you admitted as rotation or direct match? Last I heard you needed support from two PIs on the admissions committee to get in, so you probably already know which labs you\u2019re going to go to first. What stories have you heard?\n\nThe students are very friendly and collaborative outside of lab and most people aren\u2019t depressed. Some labs are internally competitive, but honestly compared to dealing with premed undergrads it\u2019s basically chill.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much department culture these days since the last few years of isolation has caused a lot of intracohort disconnect, but it\u2019s an exciting time to come to the program too- social activities are really getting active again now that the school is no longer following any quarantine procedures, we just successfully voted to form a union, and a bunch of new opportunities are opening up for internal funding. \n\nAs far as social life goes, in addition to lab it\u2019ll depend on your focus and what part of the city you live in. There\u2019s lots to do in Baltimore and if you have a car or don\u2019t mind taking the train it\u2019s easy to get to DC for a day trip too. The BME PhD student council also hosts events like regular happy hours on campus and holiday parties.\n\nThat\u2019s about as much detail as I can go into without giving away my or your identity, DM me if you want to talk more specifically about your focus or research or particular labs. Also, make sure you get on the slack channel for recently admitted students.",

    "postText": "Hi, current Hopkins undergrad here. We are looking for two residents for this upcoming summer break.\n\nOnly 0.3 miles from Homewood campus, spacious rooms, lots of closets, clean facility, great view, and quiet. My roommate and I love our place and we will definitely live here in the next academic year as well--we can confidently recommend this place to anyone that wants an overall nice space that is close to campus. Please email dpaik1@jhu.edu for more specifics!",

    "postText": "Hello! I recently got the admit for M.S.E in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. I initially did not think about accepting the offer as it's quite expensive. However, I received a mail that I was being offered a departmental fellowship which covers 50% of my fees in the second year.   \n\n\nAs an international student, I am still in a dilemma and would appreciate some advice on this. Thanks!",

For example, if you did essay-based you\u2019ll be footing the full-time tuition for both years, although I have seen people get their tuition paid for + a stipend by some PIs (although this is something you shouldn\u2019t bank on). \n\nIf you did the co-op track though, you'll be full time for only a year to do course work before doing the co-op. Once you start the co-op, you'll be listed as a part time student where you go from having to pay ~63K to around 6K.",

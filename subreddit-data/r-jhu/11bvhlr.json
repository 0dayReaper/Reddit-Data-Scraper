    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m a recent admit to the Class of \u201827 and super excited for next year! However, I was rejected from my first choice major of BME, which I\u2019m not so happy about lol.\n\nAt first, I decided to do neuroscience + an engineering minor for pre-med instead, but now (from the current students I\u2019ve spoken to), I\u2019m seeing that BME would be a better way to pursue these fields. I also attended a Bioelectricity lecture with Dr. Irazoqui that I absolutely loved, which sucks because that\u2019s a BME course haha.\n\nBut anyways, I am curious whether it would be possible for me to appeal my decision somehow. I\u2019ve read other posts on this subreddit saying that it\u2019s hard to transfer due to how structured the major is, which is why I\u2019m thinking I should try this sort of thing now, before I have to choose any classes.\n\nSo would this be possible, and if so, what steps/who should I contact to do so? I\u2019m kinda new to this whole college thing, so I\u2019d really appreciate some advice in that regard :)",

            "comment": "Most classes in the BME department are open for non-majors to take.\n\nHonestly speaking as someone who did the BME major here, the BME department is a mishmash of different engineering disciplines with bio+med applications. It's arguably a better engineering training to major/minor in a focused engineering discipline like ECE, MechE, CS, MatSci, etc. and take focus area classes and/or classes in the BME department for the applications you like.\n\nSo I wouldn't sweat it about not being accepted to the major -- I would just focus on what you're interested in and how to get that out of the options available to you. Especially if you're premed, the specific major you get shouldn't be as important.",

            "comment": "Not likely and it\u2019s very difficult to catch up on requirements if you do. In BME you\u2019re required to take certain specific classes each semester and you typically will be in them with the same people. Transferring in later you will not only be behind on requirements but also not know anyone to work with. Honestly though, if you\u2019re pre-med you should pick an easier major than Hopkins BME anyway. Also, if you want to work with Prof. Irazoqui, he is in ECE, not BME.",

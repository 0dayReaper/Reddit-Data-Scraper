    "postText": "There are many food safety and sanitation issue, especially at the Hopkins Cafe, where undergraduates frequently eat.\n\nSGA has said many students have reached out to us with complaints about unsanitary conditions, specific food issues, and other concerns over the past week.\n\nThere are several issues with dining including:\n\nHopkins Dining is aware of some students getting ill from the food. They are launching an investigation with the health center and other universities in Baltimore to determine if there is an illness going around larger than our system. They will respond appropriately once the cause is determined.\n \n\nHopkins Dining has strengthened the utensil cleaning procedures and implemented additional staff training since last November. They are now aware that some of the utensils are still not fully cleaned and will further increase staff training to properly resolve the issue. From personal experience, silverware and bowls and plates are always disgustingly dirty to the point where students have to use plastic forks. \n\nAlso, the food is excessively oily and gross to the point that I\u2019ve had friends who switched their meal plans and request personalized chefs.\n\nWhat is going on is unacceptable and we the students deserve better.",

Sure, the FFC has some problems but the quality of food they serve is much better than anything I had in elementary, middle or high school and at other universities I ended up eating at for extra curricular activities in middle/high school. I do recommend using the plastic utensils and washing/ sanitizing hands though.",

Idk how much you paid in high school but as a working student who has to pay with their own money, at least $2000 a semester is way too much for the shit food we get.",

Yes, but we are at an overpriced elite school and thats part of the cost of getting a degree that comes with a more appealing piece of paper. Could the food and service be better? Yes, but there are universities (not matter what other people may say) that have it worse). I am not happy about it, but I see no reason to complain so much. At least we aren\u2019t starving.",

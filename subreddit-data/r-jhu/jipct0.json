Every morning I wake up and tell myself \u201coh well here\u2019s to another miserable day lol\u201d whereas before Zoom University it was \u201clet\u2019s goooo we can do this let\u2019s crush the day\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s hard because there\u2019s nothing to look forward to these days. Zoom University genuinely sucks. I hate it so much. It takes so much effort to be able to be motivated enough to complete my work in time, and I\u2019d say I am very close to completely just slipping off and missing everything. \n\nNothing I can do about it. That\u2019s the saddest part.",

It's a lot tougher without that, and every day being Blursday sure doesn't help.\n\nBut I'm finding smaller moments that make me happy: \n---taking walks in the morning (for this SO NOT morning person) and evening really sustains me; stretches the limbs and eyes, and I see beautiful things. ---I'm not a cook but I do like to eat, and I've started adding more different things to pizza, ice cream, and eggs.\n---I listen to LOTS of podcasts and they're great. \n---I call my friends and family a lot more (not Zoom calls; PHONE calls)\n---I miss boxing; any ideas about something I can put somewhere in the house that I can punch without making holes anywhere?\n---And I love seeing you folks in class and for individual meetings, even though you're on a screen; I still get to see you and hear your voices. It reminds me that we're all still here for each other.\n\nIt's okay to be burned out or to be down to your last brain cell. We're human. But I hope at least everyone's looking forward to getting an extra hour this weekend. :)\n\nYou're all awesome. I have faith in every one of you. We'll live through this. Love you all.",

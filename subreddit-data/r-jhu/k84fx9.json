I\u2019m naturally an introvert and having online classes did not help with that . I joined some clubs this semester and I talk to people from my classes here and there ,but I don\u2019t have a solid friend group and I\u2019m worried that once we get to campus ,people will already have their circles and I won\u2019t really be able to find my own place within every body else . Like I said I\u2019m a huge introvert and I\u2019m horrible at trying to make friends but I don\u2019t just want to ... exist on campus ,I want to have people I can enjoy it with :( This turned into a rant  but if anyone has advice on connecting with people on campus I would appreciate you a lot",

I'm also somewhat introverted and was nervous as hell about finding friends when I got to Hopkins, but things worked themselves out and I found no issues finding friends in person (granted I didn't first arrive at Hopkins during this COVID mess, but people will still be looking for friends on campus regardless).\n\nI doubt people will already have definitive social circles. Those things shift around so much throughout freshmen year, especially in the spring as people begin to join more clubs and figure out what sort of life they want to live at Hopkins.\n\nGreek life is also a great opportunity to get to know people and find an extensive and great group of friends, and to my knowledge rush will be happening this spring, though I'm not sure what it will look like. I definitely recommend checking it out, even if you're not super interested in going greek.\n\nYou'll definitely find your place, especially when you're actually living on campus with everyone :)",

            "comment": "Ok, look. I can't imagine how difficult it was to have your first semester of college online, so I hope it went as well as it could have for you. I'm a sophomore and during my first semester last year, I struggled with making friends too. I'm pretty introverted too but I love having people to enjoy life with. Making friends isn't something that just happens. I know as an introvert you're going to hate hearing this, but you will have to be proactive about it. In the long run though it will be so, so good for you. \n\nJoin clubs that you are truly interested in. Join academic clubs, weird hobby clubs, whatever you want. Just something that will group you with people that share a common interest. It's a natural icebreaker. I'm guessing starting conversations with people isn't your favorite thing in the world, but trust me, do it once and it will get so much easier. People love talking about themselves! I know I do. \n\nEverything is easier in person. Grabbing food with someone after class, forming study groups, etc... it's all so much easier. It sucks that some of that might not be possible for a while. But look at it this way: *everyone is in the same boat*. So, so many freshman will be coming to campus trying to find their people. Don't lock yourself in your dorm room during the first few weeks. \n\nIf everything I said here is just rambling nonsense, let me know and I'll tell you more about my personal experience. Also: I am literally so bored all of the time so if you want to talk to someone about anything Hopkins related or life related or whatever related, I'm here. Good luck with finals, stay cool :)",

It\u2019s important to remember that you aren\u2019t going to be the only one feeling this way. Everyone went through the whole \u201ccan I make friends in an online environment??\u201d Process so people will be more than receptive to you. \n\nBe it new friends, people from clubs/class, or people with established friendship groups, you\u2019re sure to find people you mesh with even if it takes a while. Hell I had a couple (very close friends) on campus but it was only when we went online that I formed a solid friendship group as well. Friendship comes in many different forms and you\u2019re sure to make some at jhu. Good luck going forwards!\n\nEdit: Ik someone said this before but PLEASE be proactive in making friends. I\u2019ve met too many \u201cI don\u2019t have any friends but I refuse to talk to people or join clubs\u201d type of people. It\u2019s a two way street so you gotta put in some work",

I've found it difficult to make friends with people online and, because I'm more of an introvert around new people but an extrovert around my friends, I was worried about coming to campus and not finding the right people. I'm also going to be in AMR II and people are saying it won't be as social this year (also everyone I do know is in Charles Commons). I didn't believe it before, but I really do think it's true that a lot of people are in the same situation. I'm trying to convince myself of this as well, but I think once we get to campus, as long as you're willing to put in the effort and bare with being a little awkward, you'll meet a great friend group. I definitely don't have a solid friend group yet, so don't feel too alone; most of us freshmen are coming to campus looking to meet new people (even if some do have close friends already).

I don't remember that many 5+ person friend groups; more likely, you'll have a few close friends to live with junior year (like 1-3). Next year try to go to open club events (don't feel like the clubs you joined now you have to stick with), hall events, and stay open to making friends thru classes. I made friends thru classes even up till junior spring so its really never too late to put yourself out there (though I get that its hard!) Also when you meet more people, there's a lot of free events on campus you can invite them to go to with you like Sterling Brunch, etc. In general, people are more willing to say yes to hanging out on campus/grabbing coffee in the library then going off-campus. It will happen! Don't sweat it :)",

I have one really close friend (who I knew before we got into hopkins), so I\u2019m also worried about whether we will be a part of the same friend circle once we\u2019re both on campus. \n\nThere\u2019s definitely people in the same boat, and people who don\u2019t really like making friends online. I completely understand the worry about not having a solid friend group once we are on campus.\n\nI\u2019m not going to campus in the spring, and honestly I\u2019m fine with the social life I have right now with (mostly) non-jhu people, but I\u2019m always willing to chat as well!

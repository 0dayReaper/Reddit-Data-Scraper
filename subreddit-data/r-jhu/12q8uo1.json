    "postText": "Posted on Stanford\u2019s thread but posting here too for other side opinion. I feel like the answer is obvious but this is a \u201cfollow my heart vs brain\u201d dilemma. \n\nI got into Stanford for my Master\u2019s in Electrical Engineering, which has been my dream school but funding isn\u2019t guaranteed for MS through TAship every semester/quarter.\n\nOn the other hand, I have the opportunity to do a fully-funded Master\u2019s while earning a good salary through an employer at Hopkins.\n\nThe TLDR pro/cons of each is:\nStanford: I like the Bay Area, potentially interested in startups and industry in the future (i kind of got my foot in the door with a FAANG internship), more classes under quarter system, and general prestige in my field. Downside is potentially 75K in loans, faster-paced quarter system, and TA positions aren\u2019t guaranteed renewals even if acquired. \n\nHopkins: I really liked the employer I worked for, more practical classes for industry since designed for professionals, almost six figs salary while master\u2019s funded, and closer to home since I\u2019m from the southeast. Downside is I enjoy being a student and the student community life it brings, evading the 9-5 lifestyle a little longer, and I\u2019d be living in the suburbs most likely closer to work and not sure if I like Baltimore/D.C. as much as SF.",

            "comment": "Is this for JHU EP? As a graduate of the ECE program, the classes are pretty meh and not of great quality. They\u2019re usually taught by folks out of APL and so there\u2019s a bias towards defense-related applications/material (e.g. radar). The coursework is tailored towards full-time working professionals and admissions hardly weeds anybody out. Put that all together and the bar isn\u2019t very high. But like anywhere, you can make the most of it and still walk away with learning a lot if you\u2019re motivated. So if you\u2019re a full-time working professional, tuition is covered by your employer, need the ability to complete a degree online, you\u2019re self-motivated, and focus on an area that\u2019s not covered well by other online programs (e.g. signal processing as opposed to computer science) then JHU can be a solid option.\n\nI\u2019ve also lived/worked in the Bay Area and had two summer interns that were doing their masters through Stanford. They were both exceptional and in the years since they\u2019ve both gone on to bigger and better things\u2026 leaving me in the dust from a career standpoint. I imagine the program is pretty rigorous to keep high caliber engineers engaged. It obviously has the brand power. I do think Stanford can open doors and has the potential to change your career trajectory in ways that only other elite schools with a strong alumni network can. But in most(?) situations, it\u2019s just another bullet point on your resume and it listing Stanford vs. another (more affordable) school won\u2019t make a difference.\n\nWhile the money is a significant amount, I\u2019m going to be a bit contrarian and say this is one of the few times it\u2019s justified. This is an investment in yourself/career, so kind of the same category of taking on debt to become a doctor. Not to say it shouldn\u2019t be factored into your decision, just that some can be quick to write-off anything when the stakes are high. If you want to get involved in the startup scene then you\u2019ll need to learn and embrace taking calculated risks.\n\nSilicon Valley is awesome and I\u2019d live there again in a heartbeat if it was remotely affordable with a family (and wouldn\u2019t require a crazy long commute). DMV has its merits but it\u2019s going to be a poor substitute if you\u2019re into the Bay Area vibe. Good luck in your decision.",

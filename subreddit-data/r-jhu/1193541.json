    "postText": "I\u2019m getting a research tech job for my gap year and applying for PhD programs in CMDB, does anyone know if the professors at JHU respect their PhD students ? Is the environment considerate or do they overwork their students ? I\u2019m hearing ab the UCSD strikes and want to make sure my future school is decent to their students .",

That being said, I've known plenty of other professors who are excellent advisors and good people according to their students. I suggest you talk to various professors' students to get a sense of what they are like and who you might want to work with.",

Students will be able to give you more honest deets on things like workload and life in Baltimore.\n\nOne thing to also consider is that PhD students recently voted to unionize, so we'll soon have bargaining power we didn't have before.",

I\u2019d also recommend looking into the bio programs at the med school\u2014lots of research overlap and different student experience. The PhDs at Hopkins recently voted to unionize so I\u2019d look into how all that went down too.",

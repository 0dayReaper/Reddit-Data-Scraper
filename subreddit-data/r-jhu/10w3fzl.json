    "postText": "Hi! I'm an admitted PhD student and likely committing to JHU. I tried searching the sub but didn't find anything very recent; what's the state of parking for graduate students here for on-campus surface lots? Are there enough parking spots for the number of permits they sell? Any word on whether prices are being raised again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been difficult finding housing within walking distance that is within our budget, is a decent place to live, and allows cats, so it looks like living further out and commuting might be my only option. TIA!",

So might not be much available in the lower cost surface lots. \n\nPrices have actually decreased slightly, so I would not anticipate an increase, but that's typically not something that is announced more than a few months in advance either way. \n\nIf you are looking for housing that permits pets and is an easy (20-30 min) public transit bus trip from campus, [Rogers Forge Apartments](https://www.udr.com/baltimore-apartments/towson/rodgers-forge/) is an option.",

Near the east gate, there\u2019s metered street parking. I only go 1-2/week so this is perfect for me. \n\nAnother option is to live near a shuttle stop, so that could open up to neighborhoods in fells point and Mount Vernon (Peabody).",

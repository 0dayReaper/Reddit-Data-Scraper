    "postText": "Hi! I'm planning to take Chem I and Chem II over the summer here, but I had a question if you guys thought it would be better to take Chem I lab over the summer while doing Chem I Lecture or if it's more manageable to do Lab I and Lab II (I have to take Lab II over Spring semester anyways) in the regular school year so I don't burn myself out with content over the summer. Also, would it be better to take Orgo during the semester (without labs, since I might just do those in the summer) with Chem labs or take Orgo next summer? My friend was concerned about the one year gap between taking Gen Chem and Orgo, but that's why I was considering taking Chem Labs during the regular semesters so that I can have some motivation to coninue reviewing Chem for Orgo in the summer.",

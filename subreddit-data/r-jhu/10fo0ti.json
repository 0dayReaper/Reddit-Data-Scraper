I took it with different prof though and they gave tons of extra credit so it was very easy\n\nI had Castello for a different class, not a great lecturer tbh but reasonable level of HW and generous grading. I wouldn\u2019t take it though unless you\u2019re prepared to learn a lot on your own\n\nKushnarev I also had for different class and he was decent lecturer but exams were extremely unpredictable",

    "postText": "Hi all! I'm currently applying ED II for JHU's class of '27 and finished setting up my admissions portal only to find that my early decision agreement had not been received by the university. I realize that I had my guardian already signed my form on Common App, but there is a separate form on JHU's website that seems to be optional to send to JHU admissions. I've already emailed JHU's admissions team about my question, but I'd like some other opinions in the meantime. Do you think it would affect my admissions chances if I were to submit this form late on the off chance that I need to fill out both forms? (The deadline was Jan. 3rd and I get back from winter break on the 10th). Thanks for your help!",

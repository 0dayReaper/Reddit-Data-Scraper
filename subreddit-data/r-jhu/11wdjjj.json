    "postText": "Hi! I graduated with my MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics back in 2019 (from another School of Public Health). and I am considering a job opportunity at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. If you're currently going to school and or working there, how bad is it in Baltimore, truly? Is it as bad (crime, being mugged) as everyone says it is, or is it an exaggeration? How safe do you feel living in the Baltimore area, especially when walking home, etc.? And if folks have neighborhood recommendations, I would love those as well! Any input regarding this would be much appreciated. Thanks so much!",

            "comment": "I live in a Baltimore neighborhood that the jhmi shuttle stops at. My neighborhood is safer than the east Baltimore area where the school of public health is. I take the jhmi to the med campus every day and don\u2019t have problems. IN ADDITION THIS IS IMPORTANT- the school offers a shuttle service before 9am and after 5:30pm. If you live within a certain distance from the med campus, they will pick you up and drop you right at your door. The downside is that sometimes the waits are long but if you\u2019re waiting for more than 15 minutes they\u2019ll send you a free Lyft. I highly recommend looking at the bus routes that stop at the med campus. The most reliable one is the one that goes to both Peabody and homewood. You can also probably find the on demand night shuttle map online as well. The app the buses use is transloc. I honestly wouldn\u2019t recommend living in east Baltimore, not worth it and not a lot to do. I would recommend \u201csafer\u201d areas like fells point, mt vernon, Bolton hill, and commuting via the shuttle. I feel safe in these areas and living there!",

Just out of curiosity, are even the safer neighborhoods a little sketch? What's the worst that has happened in neighborhoods such as Mt. Vernon, Bolton Hill, and Fells Point?",

Just out of curiosity, have you ever been mugged or had your car (if you have one) broken into before while living in Baltimore, or have you just heard about it anecdotally? I'm just curious how prevalent it truly is, and if it's so prevalent that people who hear stories of that happening eventually have it happen to themselves. \n\nAlso, I've been reading articles on advice for living in Baltimore. There seems to be an emphasis on ALWAYS travelling in groups, especially when you are going to a bar, etc. I'm currently in Boston, and I've gone to and gone home from bars alone just fine, even when it's been late at night. Will my experience in Baltimore be different? Thanks again u/Albaloca!",

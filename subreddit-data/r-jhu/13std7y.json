    "postText": "Is this a manageable schedule for a prospective Biophysics(premed) major? I also want to have time to explore research and extracurriculars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently unsure on whether I should use my Calc BC credits and skip to Calc III. I feel pretty confident on the topics from Calc BC but does anyone have any insight on whether to take Calc III freshman year fall (on top of orgo).\n\nIf I don't want to take Calc III in the fall, can I still accept the Calc BC credits and do Calc III in sophmore/junior year? If I can do this, should I take some sort of Statistics course or something instead?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I was confused on SIS because it says that there are open spots for Intro Orgo Chem I for Falzone but there are also a lot of people on the waitlist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gv7o1yz2s92b1.png?width=1898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9d348ddb1a317c3b190e3743ed34e5471a1ad05b",

            "comment": "Can't comment on your schedule as I'm not biophys but often times when a class has open seats *and* people on the waitlist it usually means that those open seats are reserved for a specific group of people. Likely freshmen in Orgo's case, which means that (given you have the prereqs for the class, which I assume you do) you should be able to register just fine.\n\nEdit: Can make a small comment on your schedule! Who are you taking IFP with? Just out of curiosity",

While the difficulty is kind of dependent on the instructor, that's mainly in terms of how tough they grade. Workload is more or less the same all around, at least from what I've seen/heard. IFP is a totally manageable class and a great way to get writing intensive credit. Keep in mind that IFP (and pretty much every writing seminars class by extension) puts a big focus on in-class discussion/participation, so try to speak up a couple times per class and you'll be fine in that regard.\n\nAlso, I just remembered this: if you do take IFP, let me know what books you need for it (it probably won't tell you until closer to the start of the school year). I still have both of my books from IFP I've been trying to get rid of LOL",

Calc 3 is definitely an easier class than Calc 2, but you kinda get screwed with the harder Orgo profs cuz ur a freshman. Only thing for me is the classes are a bit early, as you\u2019ll realize very soon 9 am\u2019s feel like 6 am\u2019s. Good Luck!",

One thing I\u2019d suggest is to look at multiple fys classes because spots are so limited so there\u2019s a chance you might not get your top choice and play around with how that might change your other class schedules",

Intro to Computing is also a relatively easy class just requires some time for the class. I heavily enjoyed Calc 3 and found it not to be too time consuming but that may be just because I spent more time understanding the intitial concepts. If u have more questions u can personal message me.",

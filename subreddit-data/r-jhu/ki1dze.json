    "postText": "Are any other '24s feeling some middle child syndrome with the class of '25 admissions coming in? I don't at *all* mean this in a malicious way. I've met one and they were very sweet, and I wish them all the absolute best.\n\nI guess it's just really starting to hit me that I haven't really had my freshman year, and that I quite possibly never will. I admit it possibly a little bit of jealousy. Sometimes I just think about how I might start my first semester on campus as a sophomore, watching all the freshmen experience the hype of their first year and missing out on all that first year free food and first year events and orientation fun, (which I know is awkward for some people, but new people and all the new stuff can be pretty fun). Then I start to lowkey think about how Hopkins might forget about how much the '24s don't know Hopkins and we'll never get a real orientation and introduction to Hop and stuff. Realistically, this is just a long thought spiral, not a real worry I know I'm just self-indulging in my pity a little too much.\n\nHonestly, when I take the time to step back from it, I'm well aware it's not the end of the world, and again I do *not* want any '25s feeling unwelcome, I am,  very excited for y'all to join us.\n\nI just want to talk it out with other '24s, and I don't fully feel comfortable reaching out to any '24s that i know right now. I've tried to vent to an upperclassmen friend but they were just like, \"You don't know how good you've got it with online classes/on-campus isn't all that hype/you'd be sick of it soon anyway.\" Maybe that's true, but I'd like to get sick of campus first before I decide that. I don't think they meant to be rude but it's just made me so upset when I think about it.\n\nMy mom is the same. The first thing she said when my graduation was cancelled and that I might not go to campus, she was like \"Oh whatever, it's not the end of the world/it could be worse.\" I honestly am not even upset about missing my graduation, but it's so frustrating that apparently nothing that I was supposed to have matters. I know she kinda regrets it lowkey but honestly it's still in my head and I just don't have anyone else to vent to about this stuff because most of my friends actually ended up being on campus at their schools.\n\nIt's really frustrating to hear and I don't want to blow up at anyone so I figured I'd just get this all out in a subreddit post before I waste my time in an frustration/self-pity spiral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, not being on campus, missing a graduation, I am well aware these are necessary sacrifices, I do not regret them, and I know there are worse things in the world. It still hurts a little, though.\n\nok thanks for your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(edit: also i'm really sorry if this gets anyone down and if i see that happening ill take it down immediately.. i just thought it would help me to just talk it out with any '24s but if it seems to hurt anyone or make things worse for people ill take this down)",

Your excitement is matched with the campus atmosphere, where as a sophmore its more like you're expected to be used to everything already I think.",

I\u2019m hoping that they\u2019ll let us have our own orientation, and maybe let us get to campus early along with the freshmen in the fall. Even if we do end up on campus in the spring, it won\u2019t even come close to a normal in person experience. Also, I\u2019m pretty confident in our class officers to advocate for us, I think they\u2019ve been doing well so far. \nFeel free to message me if you want to talk more or just vent, it would be great to talk to someone feeling the same way.",

The sophomore dorms/dining halls are better though, so you'll just have a G'd-up \"freshman\" year experience in Charles Commons, McCoy, Wolman, Rodgers, Nolan's, etc.\n\nI think what makes freshman year special is definitely the orientation programs and just experiencing everything around campus for the first time. As long as you have those things, your sophomore year will probably feel quite similar to freshman year (and maybe even better since you don't have to deal with AMR I rats?)\n\nHope everything goes well!

Idk about other high schools but my high school graduation was just a video of a teacher reading people\u2019s names. I was literally looking forward to these two events since freshman year of high school and there\u2019s no getting them back. But I\u2019m trying to focus on the positive and am looking forward to hopefully being on campus and meeting amazing people. I feel like I can\u2019t complain too because of the pandemic but keep in mind that complaining is different than saying that you have it worse off than others. No one is claiming that these aren\u2019t necessary sacrifices, but they are still sacrifices and it is valid for you to complain about these sacrifices that you were forced to make. But I am grateful that everyone I know is healthy and that I get to go to this school in the first place and that\u2019s kinda getting me through this mess.",

I think every class has been partly robbed. Class of \u201825 has to fight test optional, increased college app competition at top 20, limited spots with \u201824 gap students joining back fall \u201821. The college kids who graduated last year after all the hard work didn\u2019t get a normal ceremony. I hope you all get rewarded somehow for your hard work and new experiences will somehow make up for the lost ones.",

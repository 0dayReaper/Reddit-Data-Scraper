Faculty were required to develop contingency plans and accommodate remote students even if currently the class is offered in person, so irrespective of where you'll be: you'll get something out of the semester.\n\nWhat I can reassure you is that everyone is trying their best to deliver quality education and experiences. This uncertainty will **not** be the new normal, so let's get through this together.",

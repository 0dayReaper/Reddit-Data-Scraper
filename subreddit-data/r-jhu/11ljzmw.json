    "postText": "I\u2019ve just received an interview invite for JHU\u2019s PBPM program and am in shock. Can anyone share insight as to what the interview process was like? What kind of questions did they ask? Did they have group info sessions or was it strictly just a 1 on 1 interview? \n\nI haven\u2019t found much feedback on JHU\u2019s postbac (aside from old ones in SDN or JHU\u2019s website) and so I guess for others who might be on the same boat or are thinking about applying to the program, this post might help a little \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nFor those who are either in or are alumni of the program, how was it like for you and did Hopkins live up to your expectation? \n\nOr for people who knew or interacted with students who were in the program, how were they like in the classroom? Did they seem miserable? \ud83d\udc40\n\nI\u2019m beyond grateful for the opportunity and would love to hear anyone\u2019s opinion or thoughts on this matter.",

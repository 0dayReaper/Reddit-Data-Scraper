I'm currently in the process of selecting the courses for my master's in computational mathematics but find only very sparse information online on the actual content of the courses. Do you have any recommendations on where I can find more detailed information on the courses, such as previous exercises, overview of lecture contents, etc.? Thanks a lot for your advice.",

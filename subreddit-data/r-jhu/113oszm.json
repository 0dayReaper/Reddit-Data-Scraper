            "comment": "This is only my experience and so I'm sure others have more exciting prospects. However, I'm a masters student and taking the same classes with MSPH students. I don't hate it and it's not incredibly hard (there's just a lot of work), but I wouldn't say I particularly enjoy it either. I probably would have considered another university with more life outside academics, more time in between classes, and an overall slower pace. It's a term system so you're taking exams and writing papers like every 2 weeks. That being said, the education itself is great.\n\nI find that people aren't competitive at all at the masters level. A lot of us have already worked and do research within or outside Hopkins so it's not cut-throat at all. People are also really helpful when it comes to problem sets and such. Professors are incredibly nice relative to where I did my undergrad lol. I find more friends outside Hopkins in Baltimore though.\n\nRegarding Baltimore, it's okay and it's fairly affordable. It's not The Wire but I don't necessarily feel super safe either. People are nice relative to the northeast.",

All the small bars in Fells Point, the more fratty/sports/younger crowd in Fed Hill, and the quiet artsy stuff in Mt. Vernon/Hampden area. \n\nMe personally, I can't wait to get out of here. I'm currently in the MMI program at the SPH and this city just doesn't do it for me. I've lived in both NYC and Boston prior to this and those two seem LEAGUES ahead of what Baltimore can offer in terms of social life, public transportation, and just all around environment. I've only been here since August so my thoughts may change but as of now, I don't think I'm sold on Baltimore yet",

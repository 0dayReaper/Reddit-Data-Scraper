    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman and know some colleges have specific move-in times for students. Is JHU like this where I\u2019d be given a certain time slot to move in or do I have the whole day allocated (August 20th I believe) to do so? I\u2019m flying to BWI and was hoping to fly in early morning of the 20th with my mom and probably have her fly out that same night just to save on hotel costs. However, I wouldn\u2019t want to do this if there were time slots, and I were to get a really early one before my flight is even in.",

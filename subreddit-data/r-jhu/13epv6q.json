    "postText": "New to this, don't know how this works. Getting my Masters. I'm waitlisted for an online course that I need for my degree and I'm extremely interested in. The class size  is 19 students, so its small. Since it's an online course, should I email the professor to see if they can squeeze me in? At my previous uni they made space for a few extra students if requested. \n\nI'm worried it will come off as entitled and disrespectful if I email the professor explaining how interested I am in the course and that I was wondering if there is any possibility of squeezing in an extra student.\n\nShould i do this?",

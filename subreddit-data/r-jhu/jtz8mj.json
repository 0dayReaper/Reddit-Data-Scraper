    "postText": "I'm sure many of you already know about the group chat incident. It's absurd that Wierman would even consider it academic dishonesty. As far as I know, no one was cheating or copying answers or anything of the sort. It consisted of things we would do in a normal in-person semester - studying together, working together, peer tutoring, etc. and I don't know why Wierman is so stuck up about it. It's ridiculous that he thinks he can prevent students from discussing homework. It's just homework, not a midterm or a final or an exam of any kind.\n\nBetween the BS grading, the constantly changing policies, the utter contempt Wierman has for students, and the lack of actual teaching, I'm not sure what exactly is going on anymore. The essays he posts on Blackboard responding to our complaints are so passive aggressive I don't even know what to make of them, and they purposely misrepresent what most students are complaining about. And it feels like each time Wierman does address our concerns, it's some form of malicious compliance. Did anyone notice how difficult the homework for Friday was? Less problems for sure, but the difficulty was much harder than past homework assignments. It's clear he wants us to fail for the sake of his grade distribution.\n\nWhat really pisses me off though is that a freshman is at risk of being expelled simply for helping students when the instructor and TA's wouldn't. And what sickens me is that another student reported the incident - a student that presumably benefited from the group chat and the zoom study sessions as much as everyone else. JHU already has a reputation for being cutthroat and full of snakes, and I'm angry that this student would try so hard to live up to this stereotype. To make matters worse, it seems like Wierman is trying to figure out who else was in the group chat and zoom calls to punish them as well. The group was one of the few places where I actually felt like I had support in the class. Despite all the BS we had to go through, at least we had each other to turn to. It was literally the only resource students had to get help because of Wierman's unreasonable policies. Now a freshman may have a stain on his record for the rest of his academic career and everyone who was in the chat is at risk of an academic dishonesty violation for simply helping each other and working together to get through this atrocious excuse of a class.\n\nI know this has been said over and over and over again, but please email Dr. Santosa. If you already emailed him before, email him again about this new incident. If you need the email template, message me. Ask for the freshman to not get in trouble, ask for Dr. Santosa to mediate a meeting between the students and Wierman, and emphasize how toxic and cutthroat this class has become. We might not have a group chat anymore, but at the very least we can all pressure the AMS department into ensuring that something like this never happens again. This kind of class should not exist at Hopkins.",

If you sign a stipulation agreement (an agreement between the prof and student, which students normally feel pressured to sign) and agree on the professor\u2019s suggested outcome (which may seem unfair/unjustified to you), nothing can be done. If it is as you say, an ethics board will likely understand your POV and be more constructive.",

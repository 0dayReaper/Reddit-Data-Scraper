    "postText": "So I'm a double degree student at Peabody and I've been largely focusing on music. For AMS I've mainly been taking the required classes and not much else. Now that I've wrapped up my music requirements, I wanna understand what opportunities are out there that people take to have a more well rounded background outside of the course requirements, I haven't taken my area of focus classes yet, but right now I feel I learned a bunch of theory and don't have a lot of practical clubs or skills to show, including coding. I only have one year left after this semester, so I wanna make the most of it. Any suggestions? (Btw I know that people do a bunch of different things depending on what they're interested but I'd like to know some more common things that people do).\n\ntldr what else can I do as an AMS major besides taking classes?",

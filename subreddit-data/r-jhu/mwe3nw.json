He instead tried to explain why it's warranted and that it adheres to the Animal Welfare Act, but that really doesn't say much for an animal's wellbeing, so that plus him not denying PETA's accusations says a lot. It's ok to be skeptical, I was too because it's PETA, but a claim shouldn't be ignored just cuz you don't like the organization that made it. \n\nAlso, here's the full lab report: \"[https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(18)31598-5](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(18)31598-5)\" I'd recommend going to page 15 where they start explaining their methods.",

And among those some would be criminally insane murderers, and the remaining lot would be people who genuinely  sacrifice themselves for the sake of animals. however of all the people i have seen like this, the selflessness extends to everyone. They would rather no one be harmed other than them, not wishing harm on humans just to save animals. You, a random person on the internet looking for points by virtue signaling would account for neither, being the type that when your back is forced to a wall you would cave in and sacrifice an animal to save your own skin.",

For someone acting so snarky and cut above, you sure don't seem to understand basic debate etiquette.",

What \"PETA is claiming\" their team is doing is complete normally and often approved of. I'm personally not a fan of animal experiments and think the \"but the community has done it for years\" argument is BS in a discussion about ethics.  \n\n\nBut to answer OP's question, I haven't seen the video your talking about and since it's from PETA it's probably exaggerated, but it isn't far from the truth either. Don't think that it's some lack of ethics unique to JHU tho; for better or for worse head fixation is super common in neuroscience as a field.",

PETA is probably sort of right about this one issue lmao, i'm sure the SPE effect is huge in those types of situations.",

I'm trying to find the original seminar, but my first passes at trying to locate it have come up with nothing. Hopefully I can find the audio they're using and make sure that they're actually using it in the original context.\n\nI'm skeptical though, as the link you provided above to the John Hopkins article talks specifically about how they're using the animals moving their heads to judge where their attention is going, and that that is one of the reasons they're using owls for the experiment. They do say that they are watching brain activity, but I see no reason (though admittedly I'm not a neuroscientist) why they would choose to pollute their research findings by tormenting the animals by drilling into their skulls when we can do the same thing by placing adhesive patches on the skull. That would probably require some feathers to be removed, which isn't great for the bird, but it would work just as well.\n\nEdit: I was able to find the article that was published about the research! In it (page 15) they do say that they restrain and implant some equipment. I wasn't able to view their \"previously established methods\" because it's behind a paywall. I will note, that the birds are sedated the whole time, and the procedure takes about 30 minute, not the hours and hours that PETA claims, and that immediately afterward, the owls are allowed to fly around and recover. The experiment notes themselves make no mention of needing to restrain the birds, and the visual stimuli, while out of the ordinary for an owl used to spotting mice in a field, isn't harmful in any way. Here's the full PDF: [https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(18)31598-5](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(18)31598-5) \n\nReally when something like this comes up, I need someone who isn't PETA, which is well-known for killing up to 80% of the animals in their shelters ([source](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-peta-responsible-deaths-thousands-animals-1565532)1, [source2](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/peta-finds-itself-on-receiving-end-of-others-anger.html)), and which uses fear-mongering and scare tactics (like saying that drinking milk causes autism, for some reason ([source](https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/petas-most-shocking-campaigns-of-all-time-including-a-donald-trump-inspired-ad.html/)) to back them up.\n\nIt does not. They have interview clips, but they seem to be lacking the surrounding context. I'm trying to find the original seminar, but my first passes at trying to locate it have come up with nothing. Hopefully, I can find the audio they're using and make sure that they're actually using it in the original context. I don't know, updating the AWA guidelines that they have so little faith in. An organization as big and powerful as theirs could probably get university animal welfare standards updated in a state or two within a year if they put their minds to it instead of fear-mongering.",

Both male and female birds were used; the birds were shared across several studies...The light/dark cycle was 12 hr/12 hr.\" \n\nIt also says on page 15 under the section labeled \"neuroscience\" that the anaesthesia was only used to secure the animal in the rig(yes they were restrained in a rig) and was turned off right after: \"mixture of isoflurane and nitrous oxide/oxygen\nwas used at the start of the experiment to anesthetize the bird and secure it in the experimental rig (a 30-minute period of initial\nset-up). Isoflurane was turned off immediately after the bird was secured and was not turned back on for the remainder of the experiment.\" \n\"Our recordings were performed starting, typically, 3\nhours after initial set-up (the time required for positioning the electrode.)\" The birds were not restrained for just 30 minutes. 30 minutes was the time of the procedure, not their whole time being restrained.\n\nI also can't find anything about them freeing the birds. The closest I can find is the line \"recovery from nitrous oxide occurs within a minute (the bird stands up and flies away if freed from restraints),\" but this is speaking hypothetically to prove that they aren't still sedated during the testing part and are capable of movement at that point. They aren't saying they release the animals (key word IF they are freed, not when). If u tell me a page # where they say they do release animals after experimentation I'll gladly admit I was wrong at that part, but the rest of this seem to conflict with ur interpretation.\n\nId love to be misinterpreting this whole thing and be wrong, because I hate the idea that something even remotely this bad is fucking happening to innocent animals at a college one hour from where I live. And PETA couldn't easily change the standard for this. Why would a college care if they piss off PETA? Every rule change is an inconvenience that no one is gonna deal with unless they experience a lot of pressure from the public.",

This leads one to the natural assumption that what PETA says is most likely true. Knowing that, my opinion would be this: Stating that what Mysore is doing adheres to a piece of government legislation does more to implicate the law as ineffective at guaranteeing protection than it does to exonerate him of the accusations levied against him.\n\nIt really seems like people are being dismissive because they don't want to admit PETA is right about something.",

In his research you can see that he was experimenting on them during that time. Funny enough those 4 years were the crucial years to his study.... you can go on from there and imagine why he didn't have the permits.",

Both parties would have a very easy case against Peta if the story was not 100 percent true. These experiments were recently seen as unimaginable and still are by sane people like myself. But after the autocracies by the Nazi's during WWII led to the fear that any country that did not do such insane, evil, and mostly worthless, experiments, might fall prey to another Nazi Germany which was decades ahead of any other country in their scientific gains and therefore in their ability to take over the world. Most of these gains had nothing to do with these atrocities as these gains occurred long before Auschwitz etc.. The abuse of animals, world wide is only comparable to the infanticide taking place across much of the world.

Before the first experiment, an owl was anesthetized with isoflurane (1%) and a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (45:55), and a head bolt was mounted at the rear of the skull. Plastic cylinders that permitted access to the brain were implanted over the optic tectum bilaterally. Polysporin antibiotic ointment was applied to the exposed brain surface, and the recording chambers were sealed. All wounds were cleaned with Betadine and infused with a local anesthetic. After recovering from surgery, the owl was returned to its flight room.\n\nOn the day of an experiment, the owl was anesthetized with isoflurane (1%) and a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (45:55) and was placed in a restraining tube in a prone position within a sound-attenuating booth. The head was secured to a stereotaxic device, and the visual axes were aligned relative to a calibrated tangent screen (the eyes of the owl are essentially stationary in the head). Owls were maintained on just the mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen from the time when they were secured in the booth through the end of the experiment.\"\n\nWhat they're saying in the first part is they would implant plastic cylinders, leaving the brain exposed before they're allowed to fly around. They would literally have their brains exposed for days whilst they conduct their experiments. Peta are right on this one.",

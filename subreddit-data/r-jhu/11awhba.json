    "postText": "I am a desperate BME senior who was at the 1st position on the waitlist and thought I could get into either CTE or Nucleic Acid before the waitlist was all canceled yesterday. Now I am so freaked out that I will not be able to graduate because I am just missing one BME lab course.\n\nIf anyone is planning to drop either of the two courses or is willing to wait until later to take it, could you DM me? I am willing to **buy** your spot in either of the two courses. The 8 am ones are preferable but any other sections work too.\n\n(Btw my situation is NOT a norm for seniors registering core lab courses for BME if you are worried about being in my shoes next year if you drop the course. I did not know that seniors can put themselves into the waitlist during \"junior restricted\" period and the waitlist grew to 10 when I realized I made a mistake. And I still moved from the 10th to the 1st position before school started. Also seniors have priorities for registering CTE in the fall. )",

They should have channels to get you into necessary classes if it\u2019s really the only way to graduate.  The individual faculty won\u2019t be able to help\n you but if the department is asking on your behalf they should be able to bend the rules a bit.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be fine.  Should you have planned better?  Probably, but stuff like this isn\u2019t that rare.  Problems like these are the whole purpose of the Office of Academic Advising and Departmental Advisors so take advantage of those resources as quickly as possible.  Do it sooner rather than later though, if you wait too long they might not be able to help you after a certain point.",

But I cannot afford one more semester. I did not apply for financial aid this year. So I would really do anything to get into any of the labs.\n\nThank you still for the suggestion!",

Only other thing I can think of is maybe if you have become close to any faculty over the last few years they could advocate on your behalf?  Good luck",

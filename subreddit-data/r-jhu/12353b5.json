    "postText": "I'm a recent admit and intended international relations major. However, I have not committed to JHU yet because I'm waiting on my Georgetown SFS decision. \n\nMy admittance to Hopkins was the biggest surprise of my life. I was at the point in the college process where Georgetown was the only school that was considered prestigious and selective on my list. However, about a half hour before Hopkins' deadline, I decided to apply on a whim. I just recycled one of my old essays for the supplemental and didn't even submit my test scores. I knew I wasn't going to get in to a school with that low of an acceptance rate, so I didn't bother researching or getting excited about it. I even ignored the \"your decision is ready\" email! You can imagine my reaction when I saw a package...\n\nNow, here I am, and JHU is DEFINITELY an option for me. I'm frantically running around trying to learn all I can about the university besides, \"it's IR program is good.\" I'm visiting next month, but current or past international relations students, can you please speak to your experience? What makes JHU special to you as an IR student? I feel like I can pull numbers, rankings, and statistics off of Google all day, but what has your undergraduate experience looked like thus far? How would you say it compares to others? Pros? Cons?",

Naturally, the courses, professors, and resources are top-notch. The curriculum is fascinating, the professors love to discuss with you and have many research opportunities, the library has most books you will need, and the IS department and advisors are very supportive and helpful.\n\nThat said, my favorite aspect is the immense amount of flexibility you have to pursue your specific interests. There are some major requirements (you can find them online), but past the prerequisites, you just have to fulfill certain vague criteria, i.e. taking 2 upper-level courses in the Econ department. You also get to choose a focus area and take courses in that. For instance, I'm studying Russian as my foreign language, so I made Russian Area Studies my focus area. You choose any 4 (I think that's the amount) classes related to the focus area, so I'm taking classes like Russian Foreign Policy and Readings in Russian Studies. \n\nNaturally, this is a top school, so it is pretty damn hard. But I'm sure you knew that when you applied.\n\nIn short, I encourage you to strongly consider the IS program here. I had never been this excited about school before enrolling here!\n\nEdit: feel free to PM me with any questions :)",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a rising senior in high school. I am based out of North Carolina. I plan on majoring in Astrophysics. I am particularly interested in cosmology and galaxy formation. I have started my research into short listing colleges. It would be really helpful if I can get some inputs on the Astro major and the department:\n\n1. How do you find the rigor of courses for the\n     Physics/Astro major?\n2. How competitive are the research opportunities?\n3. What would you say about the professors and \n     the department?\n4. How is the overall environment at JHU? I am one    \n     who is really interested  in studies and don't care\n     much about anything else.\n\n      I would like to know if JHU would be a good fit.\n\nI really appreciate any and all the responses from current JHU attendees.\n\nThank you very much for your time!",

            "comment": "Just to be clear, Hopkins doesn\u2019t offer an Astronomy major, only physics. That said, your professors will be a mix of those doing research in all subfields of physics including Astrophysics and Cosmology.\n\n1. Courses are fairly rigorous and I felt they did a decent job of preparing me for graduate studies.\n\n2. Competitive in what sense? Students do not compete with each other for research opportunities; those are abundant. Generally though the research you do will make you competitive for future opportunities.\n\n3. The department is quite supportive of its students, particularly undergraduates. Physics majors have a large and we\u2019ll stocked study space, and the department hosts regular feedback sessions to get input from students on what they want out of the department/major.\n\n4. You won\u2019t have a problem focusing on your studies at Hopkins. The student body is diverse enough that you can find a little bit of everything, but there isn\u2019t an overall party culture that you\u2019ll feel pressured to join.\n\nOverall, I also came to Hopkins looking to get involved in Astro research, and now I\u2019m doing my PhD in the field! I\u2019d say it served me pretty well.",

Will it give you a leg up for PhD? Were are you planning to go for PhD? My dream would be do undergrad at JHU and PhD at Caltech!\n\nWould you have preferred JHU over Brown or Princeton?",

I'm currently doing my PhD at Stanford - a good number of majors my year went off to competitive PhD programs, so the department is definitely well respected. There are more than enough opportunities for you to build a strong resume for top programs.\n\nIt's tough to say in hindsight what I would have preferred. Princeton was one of my top choices when I was in high school, but after graduating it's hard to say what my undergrad experience would have been like anywhere but Hopkins. To be frank, your experience in undergrad is entirely what you make of it - if you're resourceful enough to find opportunities for yourself, you won't have any issue advancing yourself in the field!",

JHU definitely has pretty nerdy vibes if that\u2019s what you are into. \n\nLast thing I forgot - the worst part of Hopkins is Baltimore, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. You\u2019re basically situated in a bubble surrounded by extremely poor neighborhoods. You can draw your own conclusions from that.",

            "comment": "I was physics for a few years and switched to AMS. I liked the physics department a lot. Plenty of good professors doing amazing things in terms of research, but there isn\u2019t an Astro major as far as I\u2019m aware (not like it matters much, given you\u2019ll need to continue on to PhD). You are probably aware Adam Reiss is faculty, and the Space Telescope Institute, which controls the Hubble and helped develop JWST, is next door. There\u2019s a woman I worked with on galactic dynamics named Nadia Zakamska if you want to look up her research. \n\nIn terms of the overall culture at JHU - social life is pretty dead and what exists is dominated by both legitimate and underground Greek life. Students have a work hard, party hard mentality. \nClasses are graded on a C average generally so it does get competitive. In my physics classes, the highest score on some exams would be in the 20-30% and then curved. \n\nIf you have more questions, feel free to dm. Hope this helped!",

If Dr. Riess is still teaching I highly recommend his class.\n\nThere\u2019s no Astronomy major at Hopkins, but there is a Space Science and Engineering minor, and the Physics majors get a ton of support. They have their own hangout space in Bloomberg and there\u2019s no shortage of space science opportunities at Hopkins because of the APL and Space Telescope Science Institute. Most of my physics major friends worked for NASA part-time.",

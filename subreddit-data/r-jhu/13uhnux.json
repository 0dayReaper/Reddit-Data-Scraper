    "postText": "AMR 1 and 2 have window ACs, but what range of temperatures do they support? I know that in Wolman their thermostats only go down 72 during the warmer months. Sleeping in a cool (~65 degrees)  room is important to me. My window ac, like, at home, goes down to 64 which is absolutely lovely for me. I'll also miss my bidet dearly.",

I was just admitted to jhu today \ud83e\udd73 But, I had forgotten to add them to my schools to receive the CSS Profile (making my application for need-based financial aid incomplete..), and now my current estimated cost of attendance is around $85000 a year...I just uploaded them to the list of schools, would it be too late to receive another (hopefully more \ud83d\ude2d), updated financial aid status/estimate? for people who submit after decisions are out, around how long would it take?",

And if they respond with an offer and it's not enough, I'm guessing you can appeal directly to the financial aid office with an explanation of your financial situation/why it would be a financial burden to attend, offers from other schools, and the amount of aid you're requesting to be able to attend.",

I was recently accepted as a transfer student for my second choice major CE, but would rather do CS while I\u2019m at Hopkins. Any advice/knowledge would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Is this true? Do you know if there are different policies for transfer students compared to students accepted straight out of high school?",

Honestly though, I think you should be fine, just try to stay on top of your major requirements to gradually on time.",

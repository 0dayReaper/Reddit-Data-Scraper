    "postText": "I ain't even joking, a negative relation with yourself will damage all your other friendships in life as well as diminish your general kindness towards others. Three concrete things you can (pls!) do to boost your happiness, self esteem!! I freaking wish I learned these  things earlier, so ta-ta. here you go\n\n1. Every morning, look in the mirror,  place your hands on your heart, and say (SPEAK ALOUD \ud83d\udde3) \"I love you \\[insert your name\\]!\" Perhaps this practice seems too \"feminine\" to some, but my lads, self-kindness isn't gender specific\n2. Every time you have a negative thought @ yourself, simply observe it in the third person. I.e., instead of \"omg I'm so stupid\" --&gt; \"oh, I notice \\[insert your name\\] is thinking, 'oh I'm so stupid.'\" This will eventually diminish the power that your negative framework exerts on your mood\n3. Smile even if you're unhappy, smile widely, yes, the endorphins will flow \n\nNOW GO CRUSH YOUR LIFE/MIDTERMS/INTERMEDIARY ISSUES!! BE KIND TO YOURSELF! 10/10",

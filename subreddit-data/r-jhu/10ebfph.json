I applied ED II and am an international student with an otherwise pretty stellar profile. For reference, my major of choice is Cognitive Science.",

Columbia got burned for doing just that (among other things). The reality is that all other things considered, anything above a 1400 is just a rubber stamp.",

Your score is perfectly respectable! \n\nApplying ED II probably helps boost you up a bit, most of my friends who got in thru ED had worse stats than RD folks, but other than that it\u2019s pretty much a crapshoot because almost everybody applying has similarly strong stats and resumes. The essays are your chance to stand out from the crowd and show what you would bring to the community, so hopefully you feel good about what you sent in. I believe last year the ED rate was 15% and the RD rate was 8%, so you\u2019ve essentially doubled your odds by applying early. \n\nAlso, note that a LOT of people transfer into JHU so don\u2019t count yourself out if you don\u2019t get in this year - apply to transfer next year!",

Don't be influenced by kids on r/sat, just because you got below a 1500 doesn't mean your score is bad. Thats already in like the 97th percentile or something AND you have extracurriculars and a good gpa. You're not guaranteed to get in since admissions is random, but you're not at a disadvantage at all.",

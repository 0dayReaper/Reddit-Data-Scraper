    "postText": "Hi everyone! I got accepted to UC BERKELEY AND JHU. I got into Berkeley as Data Science major and JHU as Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I also plan to study double major with CS at JHU. Now I got a bit struggle between choosing these 2 schools. \n\nUC BERKELEY \nPROS: \n#1 for DATA SCIENCE OR CS\nBAY AREA- great for start up, tech internships \nCons:\nHarder to switch major if I want to change\nBig school- more competitive to get resources \n\nJHU\nPROS: \nVery easy to do research here( based on what\u2019s I heard from current student)\nOpen curriculum- double major, triple major, change major very easy \nI visited the campus and love it. \nCons:\nNot good at cs as Berkeley \nNot huge start up culture or cs culture \n\nI also want to go to industries after I graduated so I don\u2019t k ow if Berkeley or JHU would be a better fit. My goal of coming to college of is also figure out what I like or love.\nPlease help me if you have any advices.",

            "comment": "It's a really tough choice to be honest. From what I've heard from my friends who went to Berkeley, their classes are HUGE and it's very hard to get professor's attention, and the research culture is extremely competitive. Your usual state-school / private school difference.\n\nOn the flip side, it is so much better in terms of general research level -- Cal's stat, pure math, CS are all top notch worldwide (Simons institute, MSRI etc), undeniably much better than Hopkins' unless you consider very specific subfields. And even though Cal's classes are huge, their CS curriculum is definitely overall much better than Hopkins'. Their stat dept is also top-notch (you mentioned data science). For industry, you'd develop a better skill set at Cal, but you'd also face harsher competition since everyone around you is trained on the same level. \n\nSo, again... really tough choice.",

But i suspect if you have to get super nitty gritty in ur comparisons (like compare on subfield of cs between the schools), you\u2019re probably going to get an equally good cs education at either.  At that point I would choose based on which geographical area you\u2019d enjoy living most and like finances",

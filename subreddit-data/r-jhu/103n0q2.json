            "comment": "Benefits: theres a lot of projects and research that need CS students. Subjects in classes are pretty \nIndepth but feel like theyre more focus on the research side of things rather then preparing for industry.\n\nDrawbacks: Class Professors are SO hit or miss. In general, I would say CS professors are typically on the low-end of professors at Hopkins. (Had the WORST professor I\u2019ve ever been taught by in CS).\n\nI would say you should def have enough experience to go into industry through your education at Hopkins however prepare for long projects with at times shoddy documentation/notes from the professors.\n\nPersonally, I find CS classes pretty easy but that\u2019s mostly because I\u2019ve have years of experience programming.\n\ninb4 CS meant cognitive science and not computer science",

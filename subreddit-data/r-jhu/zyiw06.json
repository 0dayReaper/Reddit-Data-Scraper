I want to do research and work with new treatments to illness but also focus on healthcare accessibility. I don\u2019t plan on going to med school and would like to focus on engineering. Would this fall in BME or Chemical BME? Thank you.",

ChemBE is a pretty good fit too, but I have been able to take classes specific to my interests and do research that I love through BME. I think the major has been a perfect fit for me and has opened a lot of doors. That being said, BME majors are kind of known as \"jack of all trades, master of none\" because our curriculum covers a wide scope of topics, so if you're really interested in the chemistry behind therapeutic development and want to go straight into industry after graduation, chemBE might be a better fit for you.",

But IMO you should be well-prepared to pursue research in really any setting if you do undergrad research and you learn a lot about wet lab technique in certain lab classes as well. If you want to go to grad school, coming from Hopkins as a BME major is extremely attractive to most schools, based off of what profs from other schools have told me.",

I\u2019ve been considering purchasing a new laptop or ipad for college and just wanted to suggestions as to which laptop would be best to get or just go with an ipad. I\u2019m planning on majoring in public health so I\u2019m not sure if that will make a difference- anyways thank you!",

As for laptop vs iPad, I would stick with laptop as you\u2019ll likely need functionality that is not available (or hard to use) on iPad. I got an iPad halfway through and it was more of an addition to the laptop rather than a replacement (helped me move away from paper notes).",

You could then get a Mac for for $1200 iPad for $600 during back to school and get those free AirPods or what ever they give for each. (Extra $200 can be for sales tax)",

If so, how does it work and where can I find the price table for each dining hall? Probably I\u2019m an idiot but I cannot find how much I would pay.",

            "comment": "I think most dining halls accept credit/debit cards, or even cash. I believe for the FFC (Fresh Food Cafe) they accept a debit card. It is a buffet style dining hall and I think it costs about $15. Levering hall has a bit more variety in food options, but the price is based on the food you purchase. \n\nDining dollars are a couple hundred dollars and are put on your J-card. Then when you want to purchase some food, you tap your J-card and it purchases it through there. Dining dollars are typically reserved for students. I'm not sure if you are visitng to take classes or do some research, but that might change what you're able to do in terms of accessing dining dollars.",

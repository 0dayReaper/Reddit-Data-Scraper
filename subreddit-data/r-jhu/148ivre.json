What's the right way to think about this?\n\nThank you!",

In all seriousness just make sure you are adequately prepped and have the resources and time because summer orgo can be extremely fast paced as opposed to taking it over the semester. I took it over the summer and enjoyed it at my undergrad, but many of my classmates did not.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve started the process of deciding between the schools I\u2019ve been admitted to, and JHU is one of my top choices. However, one of my concerns is that it may not be as good of a \u201cfit\u201d for pursuing my interests (majoring in polisci and looking to go to law school) given JHU is better known for STEM fields of study. If there are any polisci majors/prospective law students here, I\u2019d love to hear your perspective about the program at JHU and whether it\u2019d be worth it to attend JHU as a polisci major.",

            "comment": "I majored in International Studies (so I\u2019ve taken quite a few poli sci courses and know the department) and am applying to law school this fall. \n\nHopkins indeed has more of a reputation in STEM, but I think the quality of majors like poli sci and IS is very high. The courses I took were engaging, thought provoking, and taught by wonderful professors. I always looked forward to selecting courses because I felt that there were a lot of really interesting courses to choose from. There are also a number of law-related courses that you can take to get an introduction to reading cases and thinking about the law.\n\nThe proximity to DC is also nice for finding internships. Lastly, Hopkins has a large research focus that definitely isn\u2019t limited to STEM. I had the opportunity to do research that helped to shape my interest in law.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to DM me!",

            "comment": "Hopkins has a great political science department especially if you have an interest in international relations, because if the International Studies program. Hopkins has a large community of people who major in International Studies and Poli Sci. Hopkins is great if your pre profesional. However, depending on your personality and what you value or what you may grow to value. Socially Hopkins is not the best, parties revolve around Greek life, the campus is very cliquey and the university doesn\u2019t do much to connect students. If Hopkins is the most affordable and best school you can def make it work. However, if you have gotten in to a peer school in the top 10 or possibly top 15, I would run for the hills.",

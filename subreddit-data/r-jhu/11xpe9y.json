What are your opinions on these professors,  specifically Toscano? I've heard a lot about Falzone and Tovar but nothing about Toscano.\n\nThanks!",

I had tovar for orgo 1 and did good, i know kids that had falzone and didn\u2019t do as well. Also when you get to orgo 2 in the spring they\u2019re pretty much all the same.",

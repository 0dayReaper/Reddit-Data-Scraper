She\u2019s planning her traveling schedule as a new International student; so she could arrive within the 30-day limit.\nBut she hasn\u2019t received her I-20 yet.\n\nIs anyone familiar with the usual Program Start Date, on I-20, for new International student during fall semester?\n(I found the new student orientation date online, but I\u2019m not sure if that is accounted for the 30-day limit)",

    "postText": "Hi all! I am a current part time online MPH student who will be taking classes on campus during the June summer institute. I live in DC, and I\u2019m trying to figure out my options and logistics for getting myself to the JHU Public Health building for 3 weeks. Has anyone else done this commute? If so could you let me know how you did it, and if you would recommend? \n\nIt looks like my options are that I can take the MARC/Pink line to campus, MARC and Uber to the building, or rent a car for the 3 weeks. Are there any other options I may have overlooked?",

Most of the JHMI shuttle buses have a blue &amp; white JHU wrap on them and are easy to spot but a few just look like regular tour buses. So while you're waiting just ask someone if they are waiting for the JHMI shuttle to make sure you're in the right spot.\n\nYou can also see the real-time status of the shuttles at https://jhu.transloc.com",

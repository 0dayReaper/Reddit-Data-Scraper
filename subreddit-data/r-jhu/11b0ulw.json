Mechatronics met once a week when I took it, and it was largely independent work. We had mini projects almost every week, where you would build robots and demonstrate them in lab section. RSA was more structured like a typical course and teaches you about how to work with microcontrollers (arduino), pid control, and signal processing/filtering. This really comes in handy for Mechatronics if you are not coming in with prior EE course background",

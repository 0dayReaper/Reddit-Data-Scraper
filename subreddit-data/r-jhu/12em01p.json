We have an esports club which is definitely just focused on league and you have to tryout for them. The GRO (grad students organization) ran some fun tournaments last year for various games (league, valorant, smash, Pok\u00e9mon, rocket league), but they stopped running them bc the organizer graduated. We also have a Smash club that usually holds biweekly tournaments, which are definitely more for experienced players but amateurs are always very welcome.\n\nThe GRO gaming tournaments were really fun and if you wanna revive something like that here or maybe just start a community here I\u2019d love to help out too!",

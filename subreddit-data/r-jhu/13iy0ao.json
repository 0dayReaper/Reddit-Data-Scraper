We're currently studying **university students' sleeping habits**.\n\nOur project's goal is to develop some insights for an application-based monaural delta wave solution to help people sleep better.\n\nIt'd be great if you spare some time to answer this brief survey. It will only take 5 minutes :)\n\nAlso,\u00a0**5 respondents**\u00a0will be randomly chosen to receive\u00a0**$20 gift card**\u00a0from Starbucks/Dunkin'/Barnes&amp;Noble/Grubhub/UberEats!\n\n\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb The link for survey is here! \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb  \n[https://forms.gle/6rUbdHvQm9mT4XwJ9](https://forms.gle/6rUbdHvQm9mT4XwJ9)\n\nThank you for spending your precious time on our project.\n\nHope you sleep well!\ud83c\udf1b",

It sucks bcz ppl put so much hard work into their college/ professional life only to find out that theyve blacklisted themselves. Ppl like you pretending like the risk isn't there and everything will be roses &amp; daisies is hurting OP more than helping. We're not judging, not saying it's fair, we're literally just telling her that 99% if three time you will be fired/blklisted if your potential employers find out that you're a sex worker.",

    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m not a student, but visiting campus tomorrow evening for the Spring Fair, next to the Shriver building. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone could give me some feedback on the best places for street parking around that area. I\u2019m down to walk a bit, but don\u2019t want to get ticketed, and I know things might get busy weekend nights. Even just listing some streets to check for spots would be great. \n\nThanks so much!",

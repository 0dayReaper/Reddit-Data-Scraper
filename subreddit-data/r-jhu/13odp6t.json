    "postText": "Hi all! I'm a remote graduate student and I'm coming to campus for graduation this week. I am really excited to see the campus and am wondering if anyone has any tips on the best ways to get around. Is there a shuttle bus that would be a good loop to take and hop on/hop off? Also, I will be with my parents who sometimes have a hard time walking very far so I'd like to try to make it as senior-friendly as possible. Any campus highlights we should make sure we check out? Thanks for the suggestions!",

The jhmi shuttle bus that runs along the eastern side of campus can take you from the middle to the north edge, which could save your parents a few minutes of walking if needed.\n\nBrody atrium and Gilman atrium are the classic impressive-looking places to visit with your parents.",

            "comment": "Honestly, both are great majors. It just depends on what you are interested in more! Neuroscience does have more overlap with the premed requirements, though, so I think more people go that route. Still, I'm pretty sure you can apply to med school with any major as long as you complete the premed reqs!!",

            "comment": "I came in as neuro, doubled for a while, and ultimately graduated PHS so I do think I can speak on this lol. Premed is simply a sequence of courses that can be fulfilled alongside any major and at the end of the day you\u2019ll be most successful in a major you enjoy. Personally I found that I enjoyed PHS much more because it felt more connected to the human side of healthcare, while the neuro major here is very much basic/hard sciences. I also just had better experiences with the PHS department staff. Also, you don\u2019t need to declare a major your first semester so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I would recommend taking intro to PH and fundamentals of brain, behavior, and cognition in the fall and try to attend events from both departments. Then you\u2019ll be able to make a decision as to if one, both, or neither are for you.",

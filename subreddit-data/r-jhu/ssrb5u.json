    "postText": "I take my mask off when I go poop in public stalls. Yes, even when other people are in the bathroom. I have lived with this secret since the mask mandate began and the weight has become far too much of an emotional burden for me to carry anymore. I know I'm not supposed to remove my mask except for eating or drinking water but the experience when I'm dropping a dookie is just far better with my mask down. Please don't tell anyone who works for the school I don't want to get in trouble.",

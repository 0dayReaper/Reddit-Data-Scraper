Also a T10 school like Hopkins, and she was just fine. No rescind haha. Don\u2019t do what she did tho. You\u2019ll be ok! Congrats on your ed2! Have fun at Hopkins!",

I will caution you that how you apply yourself this semester is how you will apply yourself your first semester at college. I was told this and ignored it, but it happened to be true in my case, at least. I'd suck it up and stay on your grind just moderately, it's just a smart thing to do. Good luck.",

    "postText": "hi everyone, \n\nI'm a senior in undergrad trying to weigh my options for grad school, specifically for biology research. I have an acceptance for a ScM at hopkins and a PhD at a good, but not top school. I've heard people say master's programs aren't helpful and only exist to get the school money, but I've also heard that master's programs are extremely helpful and will greatly contribute to future PhD admissions. \n\ndoes anyone have any experience with the ScM here? have you found the program useful?",

PhD admissions wants to see good research experience not necessarily more school. Get paid to do research and apply again next year if you aren\u2019t happy with the current PhD program you got into. (Source: have a PhD in bio). Keep in mind that \u201ctop schools\u201d don\u2019t really mean a whole lot for PhD programs\u2014find a program that fits your needs and wants for your life and research goals. US news rankings are dumb and not really applicable for PhD programs.",

    "postText": "\nI'm moving to Baltimore soon and I'm deciding between two apartments in different areas. One is Falls Court and the other is the Atrium. I'm leaning towards the atrium as it's got better reviews than Falls Court, but I can't find much information on Falls Court. What are the apartments like? I did see a few reviews on there being lots of bug and pest issues but I don't know enough to know how accurate they are. Location is not specifically a worry for me but input is appreciated either way! Thank you so much!",

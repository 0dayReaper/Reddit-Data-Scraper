    "postText": "Looking to relet a room in The Academy on Charles from late May to the end of July. The room is fully furnished and includes access to an oven, in unit washing and drying machines, a fridge and a personal bathroom. Utilities, such as water, electricity and wifi, are included. The Unit is a D1 floor plan and the room will be Room B. This plan is going for $1335 currently, but the relet price would be $1190.\n\nThe Academy has amenities like the indoor bike storage room, printer, furnished rooftop terrace, etc. ([https://www.theacademyoncharles.com/](https://www.theacademyoncharles.com/?fbclid=IwAR0ZrNpM7v25OJZijcs9ATpEYJSprb9MuKS31RbGQejqUD8w5SBfQthW1ls)).\n\nMaintenance, management, and the mail system are all efficient and easy to work with. Surface and garage parking is available for a monthly fee.",

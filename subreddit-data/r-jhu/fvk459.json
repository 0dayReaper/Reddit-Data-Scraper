    "postText": "To the admits of the Class of 2024-first of all, congrats! Whether you choose Hopkins or not you should feel accomplished you were accepted into a highly selective and prestigious university.\n\nI want to tell you about what you\u2019ll find on this subreddit. \n\nThere is a good amount of complaints made on this subreddit by students at JHU. Students like to complain about things such as courses, departments, the lack of social life etc. Additionally you many of you in the c/o 2024 have been asking if JHU is the right fit for you. On many of these posts I have seen students bash JHU and point out everything wrong with the school.\n\nI am not saying these complaints are uncalled for or illegitimate. I have complaints myself about the school. However you need to understand that there are more people on this subreddit that speak against Hopkins as opposed speak for it.  It is not common for people who love Hopkins to get on this subreddit and praise it. However it is common for people who hate Hopkins to let this subreddit know why. \n\nSo please, don\u2019t let this subreddit discourage you from choosing Hopkins. Take all replies to your questions - good and bad - with a grain of salt. \n\nFeel free to dm me with any questions about Hopkins.",

Hopkins, like every school, has its pluses and minuses. \n\nI had a wonderful experience- made incredible friends, loved lots of my classes, enjoyed exploring a new city.  Sure, there were some negatives, just like there would have been anywhere else. \n\nI was Writing Seminars and History of Art double major, studied abroad, was part of an incredible theater group and was in a sorority.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions!",

I happen to have an awesome undergrad daughter who shares a ton with us, and we take a genuine interest in the school. So I know kinda a fuck-load about logistics, housing, meal plans, applications, internships, financial aid, the local property market, community issues, security, academic appeals, and a few other topics which the average first year student may not yet be up to speed on. If I can share *relevant* insights from the perspective of a Hop Dad, I'm open to helping out. Hop is super fucking tough and getting in is a legitimately big deal.

He said he can answer relevant questions. The ones you find on the internet are pretty unhelpful, are you taking about the FinAid website hahahahaha. \n\nThat website is unhelpful, and I know for sure if anyone wanted to know more about paying or negotiating with financial aid, I would point them straight to my Dad. \n\nWhen I was planning to go to Hopkins, it was older people that really gave me the advice I need. People like you who are just cynical while \u201cthinking\u201d they\u2019ve seen past some curtain and know all the dark secrets of student life or whatever the vibe you\u2019re trying to give off here....SUCH bs. \n\nParents gave advice for long term choices like money loans and housing, the practical shet they know real well about. learning that stuff from the internet....you mean liiiike question/answer sites just like Reddit, as is the purpose of this post.\n\nAlso...our acceptance rate is 8%. Out of 30,000 applicants, I think I\u2019ll agree with the Mister up there that it\u2019s pretty fucking difficult to get in, as probably anyone who, unlike you, didn\u2019t get in.

And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just out of generosity \u2014 it\u2019s often to sound cool as the parent of a kid who attends an elite university. But I\u2019m not a parent, so maybe I\u2019m totally off, and I\u2019m open to correction.\n\nFor me, this kind of help often vibes the way military spouses who aren\u2019t in the service try and \u201cmilitarysplain\u201d. They frequently live (and form opinions) secondhand to the experiences their partners have. They try and act as though these experiences are theirs too.\n\nWhile it can certainly be useful for parents to know what it\u2019s like to be a parent at hopkins (and I know a few parents lurk on this group), this kind of advice doesn\u2019t do anything to help students. With all due respect, comment-thread-starter, please don\u2019t describe student/academic life at Hopkins if you don\u2019t attend, or have not recently attended, our university. Thank you.",

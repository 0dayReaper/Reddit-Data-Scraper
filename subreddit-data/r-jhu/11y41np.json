    "postText": "Hi, my son and I will be visiting campus on Thursday, 3/23 during his spring break. Realize it is JHU's as well. If any undergrad(s) are around and willing to chat/show us around for an hour, that wd be great. Willing to compensate you (say $50). We will be at the admissions Info Session from 10:15-11 but free after that. Thank you.",

No compensation is required (I love walking around the campus, so it'll be nice to show others around as well). Do let me know if you're interested! My schedule is pretty free and flexible :)",

I understand that you live off campus so it\u2019s fine!",

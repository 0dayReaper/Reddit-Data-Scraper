    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am going to be attending JHU for my masters degree this year.\n\nWondering if anyone lives off campus and needs a roommate to split living costs or has recommendations for 1 person apartments?\n\nOr if anyone knows good places to look for this kind of stuff, I don\u2019t know much about this so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Never lived in a big city so kind of intimidated and not sure where is safe. \nThanks.",

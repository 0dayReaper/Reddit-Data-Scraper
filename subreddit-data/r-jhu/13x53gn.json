    "postText": "I\u2019m a student from another university interning this summer at JHU, and I\u2019m being lodged in the Inn at the Colonnade, which to my understanding is right across the street from campus and walking distance to my internship location. It\u2019s going to be a lot cheaper to get a monthly university parking permit than try to pay daily for parking at the hotel or on a meter somewhere, so I\u2019m looking for information on where would be the best lot to buy a permit for. The JHU parking website doesn\u2019t give any information and the campus maps I looked at were rather unhelpful. \n\nWhich parking lots are close to me? Are the university lots relatively safe, or should I be wary of leaving my car there?",

Kept a car for a year and had no prob finding street parking, esp during the summer.\n\nThere's also monthly parking at the 9east building garage which is a 10 min walk for you. The building is adjacent to all the 2nd year dorms so you're not venturing out of the campus really.  It's a 24h covered garage (find info here: [https://nineeast33rd.com/floor-plans-and-faqs/](https://nineeast33rd.com/floor-plans-and-faqs/) and can check rates on this website: [https://parking.com/baltimore/parking-near/39.32773080/-76.61682640/3271-n-lovegrove-street/?lot\\_id=37710&amp;showListOnly=1&amp;view=daily&amp;sw&amp;ne&amp;facility&amp;valet&amp;general=&amp;displayFullCity=0&amp;start=2021-06-21T09%3A00&amp;stop=2021-06-21T12%3A00](https://parking.com/baltimore/parking-near/39.32773080/-76.61682640/3271-n-lovegrove-street/?lot_id=37710&amp;showListOnly=1&amp;view=daily&amp;sw&amp;ne&amp;facility&amp;valet&amp;general=&amp;displayFullCity=0&amp;start=2021-06-21T09%3A00&amp;stop=2021-06-21T12%3A00) )\n\nIf you get an on-campus lot, you're totally safe. If you are off-campus, if you stay left of st pauls street and north of 33rd st (this includes the area around the colonade) you're fine. I wouldn't park right of st pauls and south of 33rd and walk back alone after sundown just as extra extra extra precaution. \n\nFYI most parking garages will max charge you $20/day so if they are charging you more, skip",

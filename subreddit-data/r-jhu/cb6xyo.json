    "postText": "Hello there fellow bluejays!  I am an eager incoming freshman coming to good ol' joobie hoobies in the fall and need some scheduling advice (!!)  Here are the classes I'm thinking of taking:\n\n* Intro to Shitposting (69 credits)\n* Memes (69 credits)\n* Meme Lab (69 credits)\n* Complaining about Grade Deflation (69 credits)\n* Freshman Seminar - \"What's worse, private police or the people protesting private police?\"\n\nI was also thinking about adding \"Intro to Elitism\" but that seems to be restricted to BME majors only.  Also, it would bring me up to 420 credits which I think is too much.\n\nI know this group has gotten a lot of these kinds of posts lately but I rly need an answer and don't care if these posts annoy you.  I think my therapist calls that \"narcissism\" or something like that haha.  So what do you think?",

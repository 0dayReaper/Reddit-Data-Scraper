            "comment": "Normally I would recommend focusing on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist to buy from a private seller. But in this case, assuming you don't want to get caught up in the expense of trying to get an older used car through Maryland Safety Inspection (which is \\*very\\* challenging to pass for most used cars), stick to buying from a licensed dealer. They are required to have a valid MSI before they can sell you the car, so it's a major headache and potential large expense you won't need to deal with. \n\nI'd also check out 501 Autos just west of the Homewood Campus (easy walking distance). Never bought anything there but they seem to have a decent reputation [https://www.facebook.com/501Autos/](https://www.facebook.com/501Autos/)",

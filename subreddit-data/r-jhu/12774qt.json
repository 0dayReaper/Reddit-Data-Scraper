    "postText": "hii rising sophomore here!\n\nI'm really stuck in deciding what to do during the summer after my freshman year.\n\nI got rejected from my top REUs, summer programs, etc. and now have to make a decision of whether to stay here in Baltimore or to go home.\n\nI could stay at my lab at the med campus here and continue volunteering at the hospital for the whole 3 months, which would be pretty sad but not the worst option.\n\nI could also go back home (international student) and commit to full time research at a lab at a top research school in my country and also apply for 3 credits of research for hopkins credit.\n\nI'm not too sure which to choose - people around me go both ways,\n\nI know it's the first summer after college and I really need a break at home, but I also feel pressured by everyone getting internships and getting into summer research programs and feel like I should be doing the same amount of work here.\n\nEither way, I would be doing research of some kind related to my major.\n\nDoes it hurt a lot for med school applications to have a short 3-month research period somewhere other than in the states? Is it better if I stay at my current lab here in Baltimore and have everything continue on for the summer?\n\nThank you so much for reading and appreciate all your help!",

Was super refreshing given I also had a rough freshman year.\n\nIt actually is a good thing to have research experience outside the country (better global outlook, etc.). Also since you're being approved for credit, that research is definitely of high standard",

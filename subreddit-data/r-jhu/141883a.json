            "comment": "Unless the course has changed in the last few years, it's mostly lecture-based with some short weekly readings that rarely come up in class, except maybe the first one, which the professor may ask you to discuss briefly; it is also the longest reading assignment IIRC. But as long as you pay attention in class and take good notes, you'll be fine because the final exam is entirely based on the information conveyed in lecture.\n\nYou will have to choose one book every month from a long bibliography provided by the professor and write a short response paper (3 response papers in total, under 5 pages each), so that's the real workload rather than the readings indicated on the syllabus.\n\nProf. Rowe is a good lecturer and the list of books he provides covers many subjects, so you should be able to find 3 that are interesting to you. It's a good class with very straightforward expectations IMO.",

            "comment": "It absolutely isn\u2019t as extreme as southern sororities are. First, you\u2019re paired with a recruitment guide who is part of a sorority, but you have no idea where they\u2019re from so there\u2019s no bias. They will guide you through everything like dress codes, and they\u2019ll tell you where to go for the different rounds. There are three rounds: sisterhood, philanthropy, pref, and then finally bid day. \n\nAs for attitude tips, I can\u2019t emphasize being yourself enough. I know that\u2019s cliche, but the only way you\u2019ll be happy in a sorority is to be with people who won\u2019t judge you. You\u2019re much less likely to drop and get your money\u2019s worth. It also depends on what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re looking for social prestige, then being yourself isn\u2019t as important as fitting into the culture of that sorority. If you\u2019re looking for actual friends, be yourself. \n\nOverall, It\u2019s a great experience! It isn\u2019t a huge time commitment, and you get a lot of connections and friends out of it along with parties and social outings. You can always drop, but don\u2019t go into it with that mindset. Be excited to be part of a sorority and you\u2019re more likely to enjoy your time there. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "definitely not extreme. jhu social scene pretty mild in general. rosen-flower is on point about everything; a recruitment guide will help you through the entire process including informing you of the dress code for each event(can be black dresses, smart casual etc). my general advice is to get a good sense of how the sisters vibe and really consider if these are the people you want to connect and surround yourself with.\n\nill also add my own rush experience with a small sorority. this was partly during covid \u2014 the major difference is we met on zoom instead of in person. it was mostly fun group activities like crafts &amp; game nights for rushees and sisters to get to know each other. there is no need to stress about it, i would just go in with the mindset of making new friends. in the end, even if you don\u2019t get a bid/accept the bid, you\u2019ll have made new friends and gained new experiences. \n\nfrom your post i assume you are familiar with the pledging process, many fees, and huge time commitment that come with greek life. but still please don\u2019t feel pressured to accept your bid, it really is a big (possibly lifelong) decision that deserves time to be thought over. \n\ntl;dr don\u2019t worry too much, the sisters will help you, just get to know them and enjoy yourself",

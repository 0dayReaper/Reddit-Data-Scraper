That might also be somewhat due to the fact that a lot of people(99%) were top 10% in their graduating class with likely near to straight A\u2019s, so the expectation is to achieve something similar or greater on a higher level and it\u2019s just not feasible sometimes and that\u2019s hard to accept.",

            "comment": "Do you mean like physical things? I brought one stuffed animal/plushie for each class to cry with if I was having a bad time with that class. Honestly didn\u2019t use them much, but they\u2019re good comfort anyway and I can still hug them when I need one.\n\nAlso bring shower shoes. Also a pair of earbuds too if possible to listen to music and stuff; it helps with awkward situations and can help with motivation for workouts and just having something to listen to while working and not being distracted by other sounds while studying. \n\nDefinitely bring an adequate set of clothes. Even though it didn\u2019t snow much, it still did get relatively cold, so it\u2019s good to be prepared. \n\nAlso I found it very helpful to digitize my notes by using an iPad. It\u2019s very convenient and you can also get online textbooks v\u00eda libgen, so you can have everything in one place without having to carry around a lot of things. Better protection for the notes as well.\n\nAs for things I wish I brought, probably more cooking supplies from the first day on. The dining hall food is the most mid of mid food I\u2019ve ever eaten, and there\u2019s not much variety if you have dietary restrictions. If you\u2019re in wolman or McCoy next year you get two stoves to cook with in your suite you share with 4 people and in all of the dorms there\u2019s a common kitchen for you to use if you need it that has other kitchen appliances. I faced some pretty bad issues with malnutrition and general aversion to eating quite nearly the same thing every day. \n\nIn terms of less tangible things, bringing an attitude of being willing to learn and work hard is probably the most important. If you have that, which for the latter I didn\u2019t have nearly as much of when I came in and the former I was kinda doing for the wrong reasons, then you\u2019ll go a lot farther and have more fun with class work, research, and anything else in general. Planning ahead is a really good strat. Also having good scheduling and time blocking skills.\n\nSorry for the long message but hope some of it helps! Hope to see you on campus soon :)",

There's not much that you can't easily get locally...there's an on-campus [computer store](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/computing/hopkins-technology-store/), a B&amp;N bookstore, the Hopkins Shuttle or Collgetown shuttles can take you to local shopping areas, and of course anything you'd want to order online on Amazon, etc. can be delivered to the campus mail room. Also good to see what your roommates/suitemates have brought with them once you're on campus, as you probably won't need 3 or 4 of some things that can be shared.",

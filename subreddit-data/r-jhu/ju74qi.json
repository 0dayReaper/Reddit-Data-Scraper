    "postText": "Hi yall,\n\nI know you guys have probably seen this 1000 times now, but this is yet another Intro to Probability post. I\u2019m the freshman that was accused of academic dishonesty, and tldr is that the meeting between Dr. Wierman and the Ethics Board member didn\u2019t seem to go very well, as I didn\u2019t feel I couldn\u2019t effectively get my point across and have him understand my stance on the issue. The report apparently claimed I was freely handing out answers to homework and illegally assisting students, which is not the case. I think this was reflected in the punishment within settlement document that he proposed that I don\u2019t think I want to accept tbh. However, I am not fully decided on what to do. The description of the actions is described in other posts, so I wont delve in there, but I truly don\u2019t feel I violated ethics guidelines. Thus, I have a few questions regarding settlements vs board meetings. For general background info, this is my first academic ethics offense.\n\n1: If I accept the settlement, how does it appear on my transcript/academic record? I don\u2019t think I could accept this proposal if it appears there, as that strongly hurts my integrity\n\n2: How often do board meetings really overturn the decision/go in favor of the student? I\u2019m worried about this especially the work that would need to go into it, and I don\u2019t want it to be for nothing\n\n3: If I am convicted at the board meeting, does that appear any differently anywhere than if I accept the settlement and it appearing in my record?\n\n4: Is there anything I can do regarding the professor violating my rights/not following proper procedure? Short of it is that it appears he talked to another professor about this situation before the meeting yesterday looking for guidance on how to punish me, and it appears the word \u201cfreshman\u201d was used in the description, of which there are only 2 of us, which means it\u2019s easily traceable back to me. Whoever he discussed with advised I should be expelled, which I don\u2019t think is reasonable at all. Additionally, it states in the ethics process that the professor should promptly discuss with the student the concern before the ethics board, in which this did not occur, nor was the discussion prompt after the event, as it appears the complaint was received on October 30, and this is 2 weeks later now.\n\n5: Is illegally obtained evidence admissible in an ethics board meeting? Florida (where I reside) and Maryland are both 2-way consent states, meaning that someone turning in screenshots to the professor would have needed consent from myself to screenshot in the first place, which I explicitly said at the beginning I was not comfortable with, especially because it had my face in it. \n\n6: Similarly to an earlier question, if I am off the hook after the ethics board meeting, how does this appear, if at all?\n\n7: For anyone that has had an ethics board meeting before, any advice that you would give or any information I should know beforehand that I didn\u2019t ask above?\n\nThank you so much in advance for any thoughts or input on any of these :) I\u2019m pretty saddened by this scenario that I have to deal with, but I appreciate the huge amount of support from everyone inside and outside of this class.",

Please opt to have a hearing.\n\nI would recommend contesting this as hard as you can. You don't deserve to get *any* repercussions from this. Cooperation/collaboration like this happens all the time at hop. Honestly this incident, if it goes poorly, will give hopkins a bad look, especially given how hard Hopkins tries to push the fact that we support academic collaboration.",

I saw online that the ethics board is 3 students, 2 profs (maybe someone else can confirm), and it\u2019s obvious to anyone w half a brain that whatever happened is the equivalent of a Brody room study session/a gc for any large class so the ethics board should be much more favorable than the prof",

            "comment": "I just read through the other Intro Prob posts and your post. \n\nDo not sign that agreement with the professor. \n\nGo the route of the full academic hearing, especially because you truly don\u2019t believe you\u2019re at fault. The ethics board is composed of professors and students and while that one professor may not see your POV, other professors and the students can probably see it. \n\nIf these are truly review sessions as you say and you\u2019re working through the homework problems, i see it as analogous to working on homework together in Brody. \n\nThis professor seems like an ass even beyond the normal rigor of the course.  One comment in the other thread also mentioned the professor blatantly made homework harder because students were doing well. It might be something interesting for the ethics board to consider in the context of these allegations. You will have more information regarding this than me. \n\nAnswers to your questions:  \n1) don\u2019t accept the proposal. \n2) these meetings are fair (from my POV) and I\u2019ve seen it go well for students. \n3) if you are convicted, I think it appears on the transcript (not sure) and it will appear on your student file. Again, don\u2019t sign the agreement because that\u2019s a default admission of guilt and it seems you have a decent not guilty position. \n4) this might be information useful later down the line. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be too helpful but it could help you as you tell your POV. \n5) this is a good question but the reality is that this is a private university. There might be FERPA and illegal recording issues with this but I don\u2019t know if it will matter for the hearing. \n6) if you\u2019re off the hook, I don\u2019t believe there is anything on your transcript but your student file will indicate you were found not guilty of a ethics violation. \n7) I don\u2019t have personal experience. But it\u2019s often a kinda slow process and it can be hard to emotionally manage even when you are in the right. Talk to a friend about this to provide you support. Even consider talking to university staff like an RA or chaplain or counselor (not sure what campus looks like because of covid tho).\n\nTLDR: Contest the agreement and request a proper ethics board hearing.",

Basically, when the school considers rewards/honors/teaching assistants, they will be noted that such an event happened in the past. However, since it is a first strike, the event will only be recorded for internal use. When you apply externally such as for graduate school, this event will not be mentioned. For what it\u2019s worth, I know a friend who took one of these settlements, and he is still a TA, so I can\u2019t imagine it has too much impact even internally.\n\nIf you do not accept the settlement, and contest it with the board, and win the case, then no punishment will be issued, and nothing will happen, except that Wierman probably will not be willing to write a letter for you should you want one (not that I can imagine you wanting one from him at this point).\n\nIf you do not accept the settlement, and contest it with the board, and lose the case, then I believe this event will show up when you apply for graduate schools, which could negatively impact your chances.s However, I am not too sure about this outcome since I don\u2019t know people who have contested and lost.",

Almost every math teacher here says that we're free to discuss the problems with others, but write the solutions ourselves.\n\nAlso, what do the screenshots actually prove? You have essentially one student w/ a screenshot stating everyone here is cheating, so do they have proof of cheating or proof of discussion?",

            "comment": "I have not read all posts related to this matter though here are some considerations:\n\n1. Do not ask these questions on reddit but contact your Director of Undergraduate Studies or other faculty with experience in these matters to understand processes and get their opinion. Having students on your side is good, but ultimately that may not weigh much. You should find out whether your program has implemented similar things, for example, the CS department offered discord channels for various courses. \n\n2. Resolutions between instructor and student offending are only possible on first offenses. Thus, most of the time, they will be used in obvious cases where the resolution maybe something like a zero on the assignment etc. If you have doubt that you did violate the ethical code of conduct, you should not agree. That is why not agreeing to an informal resolution is always an option. \n\n3. Whether or not what you did is a violation or not, I'd suggest to not aggravate the situation. The instructor is likely in a difficult situation as well, because remember: online instruction is new for everyone and not all instructors are digital natives or versed. I'd suggest that even if you do not feel like it, you may want to apologize for having acted without explicit permission while not acknowledging any fraudulent activity as this is to be determined by the ethics board. \n\n4. Finally, try to create a paper trail to support your case.",

I agree that you should ask your major advisor and the head of your department. hire a lawyer if necessary. \n\nand lastly but unfortunately, don't help or share info with anyone unless you 100% know that you can trust them (which, I guess you can't be sure to trust anyone rn with online school and all)... I usually only help out/share info with good friends :(",

The students often do relate more to the student POV and recommend less harsh punishments than professors offer students (and the students decide the punishment if you have a conduct hearing, the professors make a recommendation that the students can reject). However, for question 3, if the professor offered to make it part of your internal file instead of transcript notion, do know this is one of the options the student board has. Additional note here, if you have any subsequent ethics violations, your case **directly** goes to the academic ethics board and their punishment options are more restrictive and have to consider this being your second ethics violation. So, after this, I still encourage you to be collaborative but be very careful to do this under professor's guidance for the class since you have 7 more semesters. Follow the rules, don't ever have anyone sign in for you for attendance, don't join GroupMe's sharing quiz answers, etc.\n\nIf you're worried about getting your point across, I suggest talking to people outside of the class and removed from this situation that are Hopkins students. I think you might be surrounded rn by people who support you within the class, and from the ethics board standpoint, you'll want other people who aren't going thru a bad situation to help you frame your POV. For what it's worth, they probably won't care about 4 and 5.",

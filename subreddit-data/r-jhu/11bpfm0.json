    "postText": "Is Intro to Opti meant to be a hard course? I am spending so much time on this class, probably more than I did on Intro to Prob...and I don\u00b4t think feel like I fully grasped the concepts. Would the class get easier later in the semester, when there is less linear algebra?\n\nP.S. I am taking it right now, not with Fishkind",

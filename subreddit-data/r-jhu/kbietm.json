    "postText": "Hi! I was just admitted ED to JHU today and I'm pumped because it was my top choice!\n\nI have some questions about the social/community life at Hopkins and I was wondering if any current students could answer them? Feel free to pick and choose which ones to answer.\n\n* JHU has a reputation for being \"cutthroat\" competitive. Do you think that's the case? How do you cope with competition?\n* What's the dating life like? Do people usually date other students or do they date people at other unis/outside the school?\n* Relating to my last question, what's LGBTQ dating life like at the school?\n* Do you like the dorms? What's the best dorm option for freshmen (ex. which building, single, double, etc.)\n* What is the food like? Do you prefer dining dollars or meal swipes?\n* Do you like Baltimore and the surrounding area?\n* Is it worth bringing a bike?\n* How have you found most success getting research (ex. through HOUR, cold emailing, talking to your own professors...)\n* What do you like most about Hopkins?\n* What do you like least about Hopkins?\n* If you have anything else you think I should know, please share!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: more questions\n\n* Has anyone done work-study? What's it like?\n* Can a premed answer the first of my original questions please?",

The only ppl you can trust are those that ask YOU for help, cus then you can manipulate em for YOUR gains (at least until online class screws w/ your plans). One freshman got ratted out by an upperclassmen for holding a study session and the little sapling might be EXPELLED. Embrace your inner introvert.",

There was a long post history on this subreddit about this issue and how it was unfair to me, but eventually the Applied Math department (the department for which the class that this took place in belongs to) found out about this, saw it was extremely unfair to me, and put enough pressure on the professor to drop the charge completely. AKA I have no \u201cpunishment\u201d now, as the situation got handled in the appropriate way. There was a lot of context left out of the above as to why, and really what just happened is that the professor I had for that class is an anomaly, and in any other class, this would not have been an issue. So I promise in the above that the vast majority of people are kind and helpful, and that situation didn\u2019t tarnish that for me. However, I did learn I have to be more careful about who I help :)",

            "comment": "Hello! Used to be a premed, really do love Hopkins. \n\n* **JHU has a reputation for being \"cutthroat\" competitive. Do you think that's the case? How do you cope with competition?** \\- I wouldn't say JHU is cutthroat. That being said, it is SUPER helpful if you know the right people. For example, your first semester if you become friends with athletes and people in Greek Life, they typically have access to old study materials and a lot of the time previous exams. But don't be friends with people to use them. They will know and that's not okay to do. Just don't do it. It won't end well. I've also had experiences where I have just walked up to people in Brody that I recognize from class and they have helped me just because they wanted to and we ended up forming study groups and helping each other out for the rest of the year. There might be some that are snakes but anywhere you go you'll find someone like that so. \n* **What's the dating life like? Do people usually date other students or do they date people at other unis/outside the school?** \\- Yes!! TBH I knew of people in relationships from O-week (not that they lasted). I have dated people both on campus and off at surrounding schools such as Loyola and UMBC. Many of my friends have as well, one has a SO at UMD they met through tinder. 60% of my friends are either in relationships or are regularly hooking up with one person. The rest are usually single by choice or just haven't found anyone compatible yet, and this happens every where. It functions like at most colleges. There are date parties and formals and it is not uncommon IMO to be asked to go to those. Pre corona, people make out and meet SO at frats and PowerPlant as well. Other relationships start from being lab partners or meeting at mixers or through mutual friends or Tinder even. Typical college dating scene, just put yourself out there. I will say that by senior year almost everyone you know is connected in some way which makes things interesting. \n* **Relating to my last question, what's LGBTQ dating life like at the school?** \\- Not a part of the community, but my friends are, so take my stance with a grain of salt. Quite a few of them were in a group chat for people a part of the LGBTQ community before coming to Hopkins and already met people through there. Others are regularly on Grinder and Tinder. There are for sure other people and it is possible to find relationships - two of my friends have been dating since freshman year-  although I have heard a few of my friends say they feel that they have exhausted the options by our final year. \n* **Do you like the dorms? What's the best dorm option for freshmen (ex. which building, single, double, etc.)** \\- Wolman and McCory were GREAT for freshmen year. Loved hanging out at Wolman because of the common rooms. Many friend groups were formed by studying in these common spaces. Doesn't really matter if you get a single or double IMO if you will be hanging out in common spaces. Get a single if you're really worried about personal space but roommates really are an interesting experience that will teach you life skills. Also, they give you someone to hang with the first few days before you start really meeting people. \n* **What is the food like? Do you prefer dining dollars or meal swipes?** \\- Unlimited is overrated. You will never use that many swipes unless you're an athlete. You're also allowed to change the first two weeks I think so start in the middle and if you find yourself eating more snacks than meals, switch to a plan with more dining dollars. Food is fine I guess. You'll get tired of it quickly and I ended up buying stuff with dining dollars to cook. \n* **Do you like Baltimore and the surrounding area?** \\- Yes! My friends and I are constantly exploring Baltimore, especially pre-pandemic. Check out all of the free museums, the cheap baseball games, Jazz festival, lights on 34th, hamden toilet bowl racing, artscape in the summer, restaurants at fells, go for a walk through the sherwood gardens, hiking at Patasco, do a pottery class, go dancing, of course when things are safer. There is so much to do, you just have to be willing to leave campus. **Please leave campus.** (again, post-pandemic, we need to keep the city safe).  Also join a community service organization that gets you off of campus. You'll see sides of Baltimore you never thought you would and it will change your perspective. \n* **Is it worth bringing a bike?** \\- Not freshman year. Living in Homewood sophomore year may change your answer, especially if you have classes 8am at Bloomberg. \n* **How have you found most success getting research (ex. through HOUR, cold emailing, talking to your own professors...)** \\- yeah just go on the dept's website of what you want to research and email. If they say no they'll probably forward your message to a lab that is hiring. \n* **What do you like most about Hopkins?** \\- The people. Finding your people may not be easy or happen quickly but when you do, its great. Talking to people is great, everyone is so passionate about SOMETHING, even if its not something you have in common. Hear them out, you might learn something. Go to office hours, it is amazing what your professors have accomplished and what you will learn from them too. So many people are up for last minute adventures, whether they are small things like a midnight run to Uni Mini and walking around campus or planning a last minute weekend long trip to DC. I love the area we are in. There is so much to do if you make the effort. The array of clubs and the contributions they make in shaping the campus social scene. For example, my Friday nights when we were on campus could consist of going to an acapella show, a dance recital, a theater performance, a concert with a pretty up there artist, a club soccer game to play in, a speech by a famous person, or anything my friends were a part of. There is a ton going on, most of it free, you just have to actually make the effort to go. \n* **What do you like least about Hopkins?** \\- The people partaking in suffering culture. Some people can be so negative and are convinced that their experience is the sole defining experience of this university. They might be unwilling to listen to other's perspectives. They might even compete with you to see who is suffering more. You just have to learn to ignore them and realize they are just very loud. Find positive people who don't make bad times into a competition but appreciate uplifting one another instead. Oh also the therapy they provide. The most unhelpful thing I've ever been to, they at least helped me find off-campus places. \n* **Has anyone done work-study? What's it like?** \\- yep. Depends on the job you apply for. Some are super chill. You work the front desk of a place like Wolman and sign out equipment. Get sooooo much homework done. Or if you sign up to do something like lifeguard at the rec, not as much time for homework. Most pay pretty well- I pay for all of my groceries, outings, and part of my rent myself and this has helped to cover a good amount.",

Perhaps it would have been different if I wasn\u2019t in engineering, but I truly never felt that anyone was cutthroat in anyway even when i eventually took all the pre-med classes. \n\nMy SO and I met while at Hop and we recently celebrated 4 years - neither of us dated around much before that but we were incredibly lucky to find each other so its definitely possible to find that person. \n\nI LOVE Baltimore - so much that I decided to stay here for medical school. The food scene is FANTASTIC, the neighborhoods are all so unique and cute, there\u2019s incredible opportunity to do good in this city and help the diverse community/patients who need it, and its a short ride to DC and NIH, allowing for great social outings and academic collaborations.\n\nI got involved in a lab at Hopkins my freshman year and loved my research experience so much i decided to go for a MD/PhD. If you\u2019re interested in research, Hopkins is the right place to be - finding research opportunities as an undergrad at Hopkins is incredibly easy and I realized afterwards that that isnt the case at many other schools. Sending a few cold emails is all you have to do, and professors will be more than happy to meet with you and discuss potential projects!",

            "comment": "Congrats!!! Im sure you\u2019ve worked super hard and you\u2019re very excited to begin college. I\u2019m going to answer a bunch of your questions super briefly, and feel free to reach out to me for more details. \n\n- I\u2019ve seen some competitive cutthroat people around at hop, but not within my own friends. Surround yourself with good positive people, and don\u2019t hesitate to cut off people who are jerks to you or are trying to just utilize you for your help without reciprocation. You have one college experience, so don\u2019t waste it with negative people. Take care of your mental health here, since classes are tough. Do not overburden yourself with credits. (I took 20 this semester \u201csince things are online\u201d and it was a terrible decision, making me feel burnt out on the daily. I\u2019m taking 15 this spring, which is the best decision I\u2019ve made.) Sleep a lot. Don\u2019t be tough on yourself. \n- I think dating is actually decent here, unlike other Reddit threads might suggest. I met my boyfriend here and we just hit 6 months a few days ago, but we are definitely more outgoing personality-wise. You really have to put yourself out there at hop or date/hookup with mutual friends, which is especially the case with covid. (Be safe! Especially if drinking or going somewhere late at night.) There is no pressure to have a partner at hopkins, which is really nice. Hookups will happen if you desire them and interact with people, but don\u2019t pressure yourself to fit into any perceived standard. Covid changes this, but I had the best luck meeting people at frat parties, mixers, greek life, and student orgs, because I was exposed to more social people. \n- Im bisexual, but I don\u2019t have any experience in the lgbt community specifically at hopkins. I have met plenty of lgbtq+ people, but I haven\u2019t tried any of the clubs yet. I\u2019ve always met lgbt people randomly at frat parties, in line for food, school orgs, or in my sorority. \n- I would recommend wolman as best fresh dorm tbh. People think wolman/mccoy are far, but they\u2019re much nicer than AMRs and literally only across the street. Amr 2 does usually have a really fun vibe tho, which is a consideration. There are more pests (roaches, centipedes, mice) in the amrs and closer to campus in general. You can call maintenance and get pest control, but you will probably experience pests at some point in the amrs. \n- I did the 14 swipe meal plan (lowest a fresh can get I think), and that was perfect. My friends with higher swipes would have excess. The dining plan is expensive so I think 14 will get you the best value! \n- Baltimore is tricky. I don\u2019t like or hate it. I prefer the warmer weather from where I\u2019m from. The cold, gloomy weather can make me feel sleepy and unmotivated sometimes. As a PSA, I will say that often students only go to the nice \u201csafe\u201d areas and forget parts that need the most help and recognition. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve maybe heard of inner harbor, hampden, etc., but I invite you to get involved in Thread or in other community orgs that can allow you to see all sides of Baltimore and help out where unprivileged communities need it the most!! I would say that as long as you follow basic advice like don\u2019t walk alone when it\u2019s dark or in areas that give you a sketchy feeling, you will be just fine. I would also set up location sharing on your phone with your closest friends at hopkins and family. This could be useful for safety and also if you just lose your phone. A lot of the robberies seem to be related to taking devices and cash from students, so try to reduce carrying around or displaying such things. This isn\u2019t Baltimore-specific advice, but for any big city you ever go to or live in. \n- I never needed a bike, since the campus is so small anyway. There\u2019s pretty good public transport, blue jays shuttle, and availability of Ubers. Also, plenty of upperclassmen that can drop you off at places. I would bring a bike if it is something you particularly enjoy or get exercise from. If you were thinking of using it to commute, there prob is no point, especially with covid shutting most places down. \n\nThere\u2019s a chance things might be virtual/hybrid when you begin at hop (but hopefully not), and if that\u2019s the case, it may be difficult to make friends or feel overwhelming, so feel free to reach out to me!",

Everyone was more than happy to send notes if I missed a class or have a study group before a test. My pre med friends feel similarly. \n\nRegarding dating, you should know that this is a school where people are very focused and where the work often keeps you busy, but almost everyone I knew found time to date and had significant others at some point. \n\nThis dorm question is really important. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people saying Wolman is the best or to avoid the AMRs. DONT LISTEN. None of these people lived in the AMRs, I assure you. I was in AMR I and everyone in the building loved it. In Wolman you have your suite with 4 roommates and often that\u2019s the extent of your \u201ccommunity\u201d it\u2019s very rare to find a floor that\u2019s all friendly with one another. With the AMRs, and especially AMR I, people leave their door open, and hang out and know everyone in their house (amrs are divided into houses) very well. The friends I had my senior year were all people who had been in my house or people I had met through my housemates. I think that the best combination in getting a single in AMR I, this way you have your own personal space and don\u2019t have to worry about being paired with a bad roommate, but you also have that social and community aspect that makes the AMRs such a special experience. Also, having a dorm on campus as opposed to across the street really does make a difference in making you feel like you\u2019re really a part of Hopkins and campus life. This is a feeling I only really understood once I moved off campus my sophomore year.  If you\u2019re social, there is no doubt in my mind that you should pick the AMRs and feel free to message me if you have questions about this subject. I\u2019m passionate about it as you can see! \n\nI\u2019d say grab dining dollars plan. It gives you an opportunity to get food at Char Mar and Levering and doesn\u2019t lock you into the FFC\n\nBaltimore is a great city and one that JHU students really under appreciate. There\u2019s a lot of great and interesting neighborhoods and sights to see and a lot of really interesting history. It\u2019s also important to remember that it\u2019s a struggling city and that you have to be smart about where you go, when you go and who you go with, but overall don\u2019t be too worried about this. There are a lot of programs for JHU students to get involved helping the local underprivileged communities and I encourage you to get involved early!\n\nMy favorite thing about Hopkins is a toss up between the wonderful friends that I have met (again, through AMR I!) and the education that I received. I can say without a doubt that my writing skills, and simply my ability to think critically about anything, has been improved at Hopkins. Part of it is from the classes themselves, but a large part comes from the brilliant friends you can surround yourself with here. \n\nMy least favorite part of Hopkins has to be the negative vibe that the general community loves to embrace. This doesn\u2019t even apply to anyone I know as all my friends are upbeat and positive and enjoyed their four years. However, there is still this vibe sometimes and students on the meme page and on the class Facebook pages will go on and on about how soul crushing the school is and how Baltimore is shit, etc. The school and I suppose life in general is what you make of it. I loved Hopkins and all of my friends loved it and you have to create the reality that you want to experience. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions!",

                    "comment": "Thanks so much for your thoughtful answer. I think I will go with an AMR because that way I'll be able to make friends more easily. Regarding dating, I'm pretty focused on academics/research in general so I'm happy to be going somewhere where people take that seriously. I've heard good reviews about dining dollars so I don't think I'll lock myself into a meal-swipes-only plan.\n\nI'm glad you were able to find your community at Hopkins! I hope to find my own. Also, a lot of people use humor to cope with stress so I can imagine how that culture developed. My high school isn't crazy competitive but people do like to make jokes like that (I'd be lying if I said I never made one myself). I am naturally anxious, so the way I see it, Hopkins is a great opportunity for me to learn how to better manage stress and to realize that being in school is about more than just making the grade.",

My last piece of advice is that freshman fall can often feel overwhelming. Personally, I was even considering transferring because I felt that I just couldn\u2019t handle it. Not everyone experiences this and most who do don\u2019t experience it to the level that I did, but if you do, know that it gets better way sooner than you ever thought it could. Starting college is like bowling without bumpers for the first time when your only strategy used to be bouncing it off the bumpers at the right angle. Before you know it you\u2019ll be throwing strikes every time. My freshman year pulled a 180 the second I started spring semester, but for many people they drop into the swing of things way earlier, and many do right away. Just take it easy on yourself and enjoy the ride!",

It's honestly pretty crazy how many profs have wikipedia pages / awards / are doing amazing research especially for biology! HOUR is definitely helpful\n\n  \n\n\nFor the cutthroatness - I think you just have to be careful not to openly cheat. Seriously everyone I know has pretty much been the most friendly and cool group of people I've met. Even being in a lot of the premed classes, people are way more collaborative and helpful than in my high school. My ass has literally been saved numerous times by other people sharing their study guides, flashcards, helping me with homework problems. Just make sure not to break any guidelines publically especially in large classes since there is a minority of people who will report. I really have to reiterate that it's only a few people.",

For my classes this semester pretty much sharing any notes was fine, the quizzes were open book and online but one class let us discuss questions (without posting straight answers) and another didn't allow discussion. I think collaboration was allowed on homework as long as you weren't exchanging straight answers too. It's important to distinguish between helping someone with homework and just giving them the answer.\n\nWe had an event earlier this semester when people in the intro chem class were exchanging plain answers on a quiz where collaboration was allowed, and they got reported. Another thing happened with Wierman's intro prob class that you might have seen on this sub - Wierman banned basically any kind of collaboration in his class, and someone got reported for running a review session. (I'm pretty sure Wierman's policies are a huge outlier though lol)\n\nI've only heard about those two reports, but I think the instances of reporting went up this semester because of everything becoming open book. I'm not sure how common reports really are. But overall if you stay away from doing anything obviously sketchy you should be good!",

But if you go straight north from campus, the area is super ritzy and not really that busy in terms of traffic, so its nice to ride that way cause you don\u2019t have to be as alert all the time like if you would riding on a main road. Also, several of the busier streets have designated bike lines which are nice. There is a road that runs along the backside of campus for around a half mile/mile that is good to go back and forth on to start or end a ride.\n\nIn terms of trails, I\u2019m not too sure on that. There is a park near by campus but I haven\u2019t really explored it. The trail that drops down into the park from campus is probably a pretty decent ride but also very short. I think there is a trail maybe the runs by campus but not sure. My recommendation would just be to look on strava and/or all trails and see what you can find for trails. There are also other parks in the area that probably have decent trails but you\u2019d have to either bike a while to get there or drive (maybe renting a zip car? Not sure...I tried to bike to one once but gave up cause it was getting dark and I wanted to get back to campus before dark...it was a decent ways away though).",

            "comment": "\\&gt; There will obviously be competitive people everywhere, but from my (and I think most people's) experience, there aren't many cutthroat people here. More likely than not you'll find people who will help each other out\n\n\\&gt; I mean dating is dating. If you have time for it, you might find someone here. A lot of people have bfs/gfs from before they came to Hopkins. There's a thread in this reddit that has a survey to help match people up. But more likely than not you prob won't have a whole lot of time for dating (dependent on major ofc)\n\n\\&gt; Sorry idk how to answer this im cishet\n\n\\&gt; Dorms are pretty good. The best freshman dorm hands down is Wolman with a single bedroom. I was in AMR II freshman year (which is considered one of the worst dorms) and imo it wasn't that bad. So you have pretty decent options. The order best to worst is Wolman, Mccoy, AMRIII, AMRII, AMRI\n\n\\&gt; I like food at levering and bamboo, both of which take dining dollars. Food at FFC \\*can\\* be good but it rlly depends on what they're serving. FFC takes meal swipes. Dining Dollars &gt; meal swipes. I recommend taking the 10 meal plan so you have more dining dollars.\n\n\\&gt; Yes! I've been to the Harbor a few times to go to the aquarium and ice skating. It was fun. I've also been to antique stores nearby, and to restaurants nearby too. I would recommend not straying too far away from campus as it can potentially get dangerous. But in my experience I haven't had any issues going to the city.\n\n\\&gt; Personally I don't think  a bike is worth it unless you see yourself going somewhat off campus, alone regularly. As a Freshman you're pretty much in the middle of campus so most of your classes are in pretty close walking distance. If you wanted to go into the city for fun, usually you'd go with other people, and unless they all have bikes too it'd be kind of awkward and potentially dangerous to just bike there by yourself and meet up w them. If you have a job or research opportunity OR you see yourself getting one within Freshman year that is biking distance away, then by all means bring your bike. But otherwise I'd say no.\n\n\\&gt; Yikes. I haven't done research yet but from what I've heard it's best to go through organizations like HOUR. If you have a prof you click with or that you know is researching something you're interested, you can always ask, but definitely it's much easier to just use an organization to find research opportunities.\n\n\\&gt; Hopkins fin aid is very generous, which is nice (thanks Bloomberg). And also most of the people I've met at Hopkins have been very nice too. I also like how the environment here pushes you to do your best. It's pretty easy to find food you like, and also finding a job isn't very difficult.\n\n\\&gt; On the other hand sometimes Hopkins can stress you tf out!!! And it can be somewhat difficult to find and make friends here;; I've been here for like 1.5 years and in all honesty I've made like 3 friends, which isn't bad but I lowkey wanted like a somewhat large group of friends or something ya know.\n\n\\&gt; Get a healthy sleeping schedule and build up your discipline, because the most successful people here are the most responsible. You can honestly forgo a lot of stress if you just pay attention in class, do your homework early, and go to office hours when you need help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: I'm writing this under the assumption that by the time you start freshman year corona will pretty much be under wraps (fingers crossed) \n\nIf it's not then a lot of the things I talked abt in terms of socialization and going into the city will obviously be obsolete.",

            "comment": "\u2022 I don\u2019t think JHU is cutthroat however I did have a friend get reported to the ethics board for helping some other students on the homework. It was a person we didn\u2019t know and it didn\u2019t seem like they were enjoyable to be around haha. But mostly everyone is very willing to help you and teach you what you need\n\n\u2022 I have been dating my SO for two years now since high school however I have many friends that have on campus SOs and have seen many relationships form on campus\n\n\u2022 I also can\u2019t speak on this directly but I have friends of the LGBTQ+ community who have done well at Hopkins or tinder with neighboring colleges too\n\n\u2022 The dorms are worse then they seem. They have a certain ~vibe~ I can\u2019t quite explain but living off campus now I definitely miss it. Especially AMR II which was very social. People were always in the hallways or hanging out and made for a great experience. I\u2019ve heard Wolma has the nicest rooms but it\u2019s farther away from the heart of campus and IMO I would rather be in a social dorm\n\n\u2022 The FFC (Fresh Food Cafe, the main dining hall) has very good food. I\u2019m a VERY picky eater and only ate a few items from there but even then they were high quality foods. Levering Kitchen has AMAZING chicken tenders and fries and you can buy those with dining dollars. I saved all of mine until the last few weeks and spent them all then which I think was a great idea. Dining dollars are nice and in most cases you can get away with the 14 meal a week plan. (Kosher plans are slightly different)\n\n\u2022 I think Baltimore gets a bad reputation. Yes we get scary alerts on our phones when crimes happen near campus but I have never felt unsafe on campus (except one time when I got close to a raccoon by accident). Baltimore is a nice city and I think as long as you stay in the parts you know are okay you\u2019ll love it. There is a bubble surrounding campus that\u2019s very nice and all I\u2019ve really needed so far tbh. Other people do take trips and stuff into the inner harbor which is fun, especially the aquarium\n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve never felt the need to use a bike however they are definitely very useful. I see many people with bikes and if you travel alone places a lot and would rather not walk it would be worth it. I prefer walking but to each their own\n\n\u2022 I have not done research however I\u2019ve heard talking to professors is the best route to go\n\n\u2022 I LOVE campus. It\u2019s beautiful. The buildings are majestic and welcoming. There is a while mini forest on campus, and I take scenic walks whenever I find time\n\n\u2022 The food. The food is very good but it isn\u2019t a HUGE selection, especially compared to other larger schools. (Speaking specifically about the FFC)\n\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t find friends at first, don\u2019t panic!! I was going to transfer to UMD (University of Maryland, I\u2019m a Marylander) before I met my group of friends. I spent my fall semester super introverted and I really regret it. I had no friends on campus and I started forcing myself to go to RA/building events and made a ton of friends that are amazing. Even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it or nothing will come out of it, chances are it\u2019s still worth going. I made all of my friends in February and we all live together now despite only being in person friends for a month. College is an amazing experience and it\u2019s no different at JHU. If you ever need help navigating let me know, or anyone else around you. Everyone is really friendly in my experience and I love it here. Congrats on getting in!!",

            "comment": "- I don\u2019t think the cutthroat rumor is true. Competitive? Yes, definitely. But I\u2019ve never witnessed anyone doing anything explicitly to disadvantage their peers. In fact, I\u2019ve mainly seen the opposite. People love helping each other out and studying with each other. \n- I have a girlfriend from high school, and I noticed that that most people who have SO\u2019s date people from other schools. I have a small sample size though. There are definitely people who date on campus, although it might be rare because of how busy everyone is. \n- Don\u2019t know the answer to this one.\n- I liked Wolman my freshman year. I\u2019ve been in the AMRs and McCoy\u2014can\u2019t stand either one of them. I don\u2019t know why, maybe just personal preference. \n- Not gonna lie, food was pretty terrible for the most part. There were definitely some days where they served something special like fried chicken or steak and I thought it was good, but most of the time it sucked. Nolan\u2019s has a burger station though which is consistently ok, and the fries are actually really dope. I much prefer dining dollars to meal swipes because Char Mar has good bagels and levering has decent lunch food. \n- I don\u2019t go into Baltimore often aside from exploring inner harbor, and I really like the inner harbor. That\u2019s not representative of Baltimore though. \n- I was contemplating bringing a bike, and I ended up not doing so... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth biking tbh bc there are stairs all over campus and it\u2019s super small anyway. If you ever need to go somewhere a little far, rent an electric scooter. Trust me, I used it every week to go to Wyman Park Building and it\u2019s much better than a bike\u2014assuming you can find one of course. \n- I literally cold emailed one professor and got in my first try. I might\u2019ve gotten very lucky tbh, but I just sent them a nice email using a template my friend gave me and attached my resume. Got a response within a few hours. I heard HOUR, CIRCUIT, and the other research programs affiliated with APL are great and relatively easy to get into if you\u2019re a Hopkins student. \n- Love the people and the opportunities. Most of the people I\u2019ve met are genuinely so helpful and encouraging. Even the people who barely know me are always willing to lend a hand, whether that be giving career advice or helping with homework or projects. They\u2019re also very passionate, intelligent, and fun to talk to. Much different than my high school peers, that\u2019s for sure. The opportunities here are also great. Lots of chances to pursue research, and Hopkins has good connections with industry (at least, for the area I want to work in). Lots of great clubs on campus as well. \n- Hate how hard the transition is. It made the first half of my freshman year a living hell. The combination of shitty weather (I\u2019m from CA), missing home, crappy food, sadistic professors, adapting to a long-distance relationship, and a lack of time management skills made the transition a nightmare for me. I swear, almost every Hopkins student thinks about transferring at some point, usually in freshman year. This was definitely the case for me.",

                            "comment": "When I say sadistic, I mean that they can be very inconsiderate when it comes to giving assignments. For instance, in my physics 1 class, the professor cared more about staying on pace than our exam performance, so he legit gave the same regularly assigned homework, problem set, and lecture videos during an exam week. So on top of having to study for the midterm, I had to finish the regular assignments, which anyone in physics knows are a nightmare. \n\nIn Intro to ECE, my professor flew through the math for an entire unit, and then gave us one of the hardest possible circuit configurations to solve on the homework (which he never covered, btw). In Digital Systems Fundamentals, we had a prof with the harshest grading system\u2014each homework was worth 5 points or so, each lab was worth like 3, and I think the midterm and final were worth 25/30 each or something. You needed 95 points out of 100 total to get an A (no curve), so you literally couldn\u2019t afford to make more than a few mistakes, especially on the exam and final project. There was a catch to all of this, which was that the prof gave out occasional extra credit, but it was completely sadistic because it would take hours to complete. Needless to say, extra credit was required, not optional, if you wanted an A. I was lucky enough to have covid make that class P/F. \n\nNot all professors are like this, but there is definitely a noticeable amount of them at Hopkins. By the way, this \u201csadistic professor\u201d effect hasn\u2019t gone away, I actually still have sadistic profs this semester, I\u2019ve just learned how to better work my way around it. For example, Wilson the lin alg prof gives no partial credit on exams, so you just have to make sure to double and triple check your answers before moving on to another question. Half my profs also assigned a massive amount of homework over break, which was great. Just a part of the Hopkins experience I suppose.",

Like, *at all.* Maybe I'm just naive, but I've gotten nothing but help from my other pre-med friends. It's certainly competitive in that everyone is very motivated to succeed and will load up on a bunch of activities because their friends are doing those activities and they look impressive. But, that's something you're going to get at every university, so I really wouldn't look too much into that. \n* Dating life: If Hopkins students are dating each other, they're either together for 3 months or 3 years. There is no in-between. Most people that I know are in relationships are dating someone from home though. \n* LGBTQ+ dating life: sorry, can't really help here. \n* Dorms: Like everyone said, Wolman if you want a big room, AMR 2 if you want the \"social\" aspect of college. I picked AMR 2 because I wanted to make more friends, and I can't say I regret my decision. \n* Food: The two play different roles honestly. Personally I usually didn't have time for breakfast because I slept in as late as I possibly could before class, so I chose the 14 meal plan. I had more than enough dining dollars to spare for snacks, which is the way I preferred it. \n* Baltimore: I love the city. I don't know why, I just vibe with the city. Does it have a lot of problems? Yes. Can you avoid most of them by not being an idiot walking alone late at night with headphones in and an Apple Watch showing? Also yes. Does every other city have these problems? Also yes. \n* Bike: I've seen bike stands on campus, but more commonly people just skateboard around because it's a pretty small campus. \n* Research: I Just cold emailed, and everyone I emailed said they'd be interested in having me. And that's not a reflection on my resume or anything, that's just how open professors are to having undergrads in the lab. \n* Like most: Definitely my friends and professors. Quite honestly, these are some of the best friends I've ever had. And professors are so, so open. Perhaps this is just my luck again, but I haven't yet had a professor who I thought didn't care about my well-being and the knowledge I was gaining from the class. And if you want to talk to any of them about research, if you come prepared about a topic, they're going to treat you like a fellow professional and not another lowly undergrad. \n* Dislike most: some people here are just so freaking accomplished, and it's really difficult not to compare yourself to them all of the time. Grinding is really almost in the DNA of many of my peers, and it's a little disheartening sometimes. You really have to learn how to focus on yourself and boost yourself up sometimes, just because most people here are involved in as much as they can possibly do without suffering long-term heart damage. \n* Anything else: Levering sandwiches are the single best lunch option on campus. If you have classes in the area around lunch time, or enough time to go to Levering to pick up a sandwich, consider yourself lucky. \n* Work-study: sorry, nothing to add.",

At Stanford they call it Stanford Duck Syndrome; depression at not constantly measuring up to your insanely high standards is almost a badge of honor at MIT; and here our prior reputation for cut-throatness has just kinda expanded to accommodate the sentiment. We just don't have the famous sports teams or the prime location that hide the issues of having a bunch of high-achieving kids in a small geographical area.\n\nAt least, in my untested opinion.\n\nThat being said, I do really want to stress that it's important to develop coping skills. It's going to be very difficult, and it's really important to remember that when people seem to be constantly succeeding at something. Probably the biggest negative of my time at Hopkins so far has been almost never feeling like I'm doing enough, and it's a problem I'm still struggling with today.",

I did consider the competitiveness of Hopkins before applying, but ultimately all the things I love about the school outweighed that. I think it'll be worth it!\n\nAlso it's a great opportunity for me to learn to cope with competition. I haven't gone to super competitive schools before but last year I had my first experience where I was actively competing with someone in class and it really bugged me at first. However, I learned a lot from it and I'm now actually friends with the person I was competing with! I think a lot of times competition comes from admiring someone but not wanting to admit it.",

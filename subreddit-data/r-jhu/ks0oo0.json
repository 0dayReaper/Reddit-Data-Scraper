These tweets are from a person who has a problem with the  state of Israel, which is a literal apartheid state. Conflating criticism of Israel antisemitism is a common tactic used used to deflect criticism of Israel's inhumane policies, which is very frustrating as a Jew (who also has many relatives living in Israel) but also has serious problems with the state of Israel. We can have a discussion about whether these tweet cross a line or not, or what political beliefs we should or should not find acceptable, but there is nothing here that is anti-semitic.\n\nEditing this because I don't have the energy to respond to everyone individually: \nNo where in this post did I say 'therefore these tweets are ok'. All I said was these are not anti-semitic. Of course every student should be treated and graded fairly by their TA. I personally read the comments about grading to be a joke, and doubt they actually took action on it, but this is probably not the type of thing to be joking about on twitter. Also, of course you should not immediately assume someones political beliefs nor assign personal blame to someone based on the country they are born in (the US has done lots of terrible things that I am in no position to stop).",

A TA making a similar assumption-that an Asian student who had traveled to China therefore supports their treatment of the Uighurs or HK residents-would rightly be considered bigoted against Asians.\n\nI think it's unfortunate that this person has basically ruined her career by making these statements public on social media (She is probably unhireable both in industry and academia now).  I don't think that she is actually a bigoted person-the comments were likely just made out of frustration without thinking too deeply about them..and the way comments like this follow people online makes reconciliation and forgiveness way more difficult than it should be.

I can tell you with almost absolute certainty that the TA did not, in fact, alter any students' grades. The tweet was obviously a joke, albeit an unprofessional one, and a very stupid one to put up on social media. I can tell you that we were very careful with use of rubrics, and that the TA's concern lay predominantly with academic integrity. In the replies to the poll wherein the majority answered \"Free Palestine! Fail them\" rather than \"Yes, [redacted], be a good TA] the TA also answered \"like I agree, but also, too many of y'all want me fired\". This shows the TA obviously recognized that acting on this would be a serious violation, and so logically would choose not to. The TA was likely making the joke as catharsis, did so in a self-destructive way that lacked forethought, and likely now regrets it deeply. I haven't spoken to the TA in a couple weeks, but this seems pretty obvious to me. So just, lay the fuck off.",

Are all ESL teachers who make frequent grammatical mistakes automatically bad educators? Or are you just arguing in bad faith to try to reinforce your own preconceived notions about an education that you feel was wasted (which I'm sure many of your teachers would agree with if your general manner on reddit translates to your attitudes irl) because you decided that getting into Johns Hopkins was validation enough of your own intelligence, rather than something that put a greater burden on you to put in the work to grow intellectually? And is that why you still come into the subreddit for the school you graduated from, presumably about 5 years ago, to trash others for their experiences?",

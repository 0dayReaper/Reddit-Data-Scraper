    "postText": "Hello blue jays,\n\nSo I recently enrolled in the advanced academic programs for one of their remote grad programs. I was wondering how this division is considered under JHU? Are they true alumni/students of the university? I\u2019ve been reading some mixed reviews online and don\u2019t want to get caught in a Harvard extension school type deal.",

            "comment": "AAP Communications graduate (as of last Monday) reporting in.\n\nTL;DR: Yes. \n\nFirst, allow me to validate your concern because this was a HUGE trip-up point for me and still is to some level in the back of my head. However, it shouldn't be.\n\n1. You are considered a JHU alumn. You sit at the exact same Master's graduation ceremony as everyone else who isn't in AAP.  If the U.S.' Chief Data Scientist/Deputy Chief Technology Officer went to AAP and claims alumni status, I'd say you're safe.\n\n2. The degree carries weight, and JHU doesn't take it lightly. Your diploma will say the same school name as anyone non-AAP. No caveats or any reference to AAP printed on it. My degree/diploma is issued by the Krieger School of Arts &amp; Sciences...aka, the school that the JHU biology and pre-med programs are at. There is 0 chance Johns Hopkins would cheapen the value of the degrees they are most celebrated for by having them share a school with diplomas for a non-legit program. \n\n3. Quality of teachers. I know people who were in the AAP Government program and took a class taught by Lee Drutman. We met while in a class taught by someone who is a regular contributor to HuffPost, gets brought in by CNN as an expert, and who interviewed every world leader you can possibly think of while he was a journalist (no joke, the class game the whole semester was to think of someone he hadn't met or interviewed. James Carville once called his cell mid-class.). Non-legit programs don't pull those kinds of people.\n\nI have no idea why JHU has a subset for \"Advanced Academic Programs.\" My best guess is because it was a hybrid program long before Covid made that normal.",

                    "comment": "Congratulations! Thank you. I have been noticing quite a few Hopkins undergrad alum enrolled in AAP, so that eased my concern as little bit. \n\n2. The degree is the exact same as conferred by the school of arts and sciences, which is what got me into the program compared to other schools who have \u201cprofessional study\u201d schools. The AAP plaster is just a bit annoying tho. I even have it on my campus card lol and it\u2019s included in the transcript. I don\u2019t see why they feel the necessity to even have it there like you said. \n\n3. Wow, that is quite remarkable. My program is taught by lecturers and not actual JHU professors which was another thing I was concerned about \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nJust wanna be super sure before I spend my money",

And yeah, that plaster sucks \ud83d\ude05\n\nYMMV, but I actually learned more in the classes I took with lecturers vs. those by professors. That is probably because I'm not pursuing a Ph.D., though, so learning from people actively in the field with practical experience was more beneficial for me. Having high-profile/very successful professionals use some of their limited free time to teach at a program adds to its credibility for me rather than detracting from it. \n\nOne last thing I'll advise is to not give a lot of weight to people who say \"no it isn't legit,\" based purely on the fact that they hear it is online-only without having specific knowledge of the program. It's true that most online degrees aren't particularly prestigious, but AAP has many courses on-site. I'm sure there's plenty of people who got a degree totally in person. If someone says, \"Yes, I have experience with how AAP is viewed in the field and this is my feedback,\" that's one thing. If someone says, \"No, all online MAs are cash cows,\" take it with a grain of salt. The on-site building is very nice, too. I took my last few courses in person, and the building is right across from SAIS.\n\nWhatever you choose, congrats on taking on an MA!  Feel free to message me if you have any other questions I can answer.",

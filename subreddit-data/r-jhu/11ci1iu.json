I was admitted to a master\u2019s program in Bloomberg and am considering going but I\u2019d like to connect with some incoming and current students first as I have quite a bit of questions. Was wondering if there\u2019s any discord servers or groups for Bloomberg students (incoming or current) or even just a general group for JHU grad admits. Would appreciate any links or info :)",

You can find their name at the bottom of the website page where the info about the degree is. They a lot of times have GroupMes and stuff set up for admitted students!",

    "postText": "So JHU has an early decision 2 that is binding, meaning that you must attend if admitted\n\nHowever, on their website, they state that:\n\u201cBecause Early Decision I and II are binding agreements, students can only apply for Early Decision to one college at a time. The binding agreement means if you are admitted to Hopkins in Early Decision I or II, you must withdraw all pending applications to other schools and enroll at Hopkins.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean?\nDoes it mean that: if you apply ED2 for JHU, you can only apply to one institution through the entire admission period regardless of early or regular decision (that one institution being JHU)\n\nOr \n\nDoes it mean that: if you apply ED2 for JHU, you can only apply to one institution through ED, but also others through RD.",

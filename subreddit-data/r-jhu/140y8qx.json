    "postText": "Hi! I am an international student planning to join the Bioinformatics program in the Fall 2023 semester, but I am having some difficulties requesting the DS-2019 form right now (I need a DS-2019 form because I will be using a scholarship from my home country and it only allows J-1 Visa, not F-1 Visa).\n\nSo far, I have already emailed OIS to issue me the form, I have also submitted a shipping request for the DS-2019 form via eShipGlobal. But OIS said that they could not ship the form before getting a request from AAP Info. So, I emailed AAP Info, requesting a DS-2019 form, but I haven't got any reply yet, and I don't know whether AAP Info has received my request or not since it doesn't generate any auto-reply either.\n\nDo you have any advice on how to proceed next? Because I am afraid that there wasn't enough time for me to prepare my visa on time for the Fall 2023 semester if it takes too long. \n\nThank you in advance!",

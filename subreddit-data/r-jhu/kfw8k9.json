    "postText": "It's such a weird sensation, usually after finals I celebrate with all my friends, do something fun in the city or just hang out until I throw some clothes in a suitcase and fly back home to meet my family for the first time in months. \n\nBut now, I just feel like all the stress I've been pushing off this semester, and especially the past few weeks is crashing down on me all at once. My head is pounding and I haven't moved out of my bed once. Relief, happiness....I just feel traumatized and horrible.\n\nI actually did really well this semester, the best I ever have academically. But the amount of stress I exchanged for those grades....stole a piece of me. \n\nAnyone else...how do you keep this up?",

This has def been the most excruciating semester yet. It has def shown me the importance of being a person first, rather than a student",

If I didn't get an A, it didn't matter, because I knew for a fact I tried my best. The outcome would have been the same if I stressed or if I didn't. I also switched to decaf coffee.",

I\u2019m sorry you are feeling this way though but maybe try taking little steps like pushing yourself to get out of bed and maybe go on walks or pick up a book. I know it\u2019s hard, as I am currently in bed at 3:21 pm, but do the best you can and commend yourself on all your hard work this sem!",

            "comment": "I had a similar experience after my last final. Submitted my final paper right before midnight, and then immediately fell asleep. The next day I was in bed all day, crying intermittently because I still felt all the anxiety and stress from this semester, but without having any work to do. I was stressed and anxious, and now worried that these were, like, permanent features of my psyche lol. But slowly that feeling went away after I forced myself to take care of myself like take a shower, eat a meal -- go outside and remember a world exists outside of school. \n\nI think you'll be okay, I genuinely think this is a phenomena that a lot of people are experiencing. After my friend submitted his last assignment, instead of feeling relief, it similarly took him some time to reel from the effects of heightened, sustained stress from these past few months. Not to be dramatic, but I think a lot of felt some trauma with having to complete a semester with difficult schoolwork against a backdrop where it literally felt like the world was ending. It'll take us some time to process that. But I think you'll be okay. You say the amount of stress you felt this semester stole a piece of you. Get it back by doing something you love, something you weren't able to do during the semester. Perhaps a hobby, or in my case, by just taking care of yourself.",

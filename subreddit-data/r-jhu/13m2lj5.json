    "postText": "Hello I have been granted provisional status to the Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering, Engineering for Professionals program as a MS student in Computer Science. I have to take a Data structures course as a prerequisite. Can I take this course in another university like Towson or CCBC (i doubt it) and transfer the credits? I also want to hear from other MS students if JHU is worth it for Computer Science given that the school is a bit too expensive for me.",

I was in the same boat when I started my MS in Information Systems &amp; Technology from Whiting EPP. I took the Data Structures over a summer at Hopkins\u2019 Medical Center Drive campus (I live in DC).  This was in 2004. It was the hardest class I took through my MS degree journey. \n\nYMMV but my MS from Hopkins was worth every penny given my employer paid for all of it. If you can get a job with tuition reimbursement, do it. It\u2019s a common benefit at many companies in the DC area if you\u2019ve got a BS and are working in tech. Working FT and going to JHU after work is hard but if you were looking at EPP I\u2019m guessing that was already your plan.",

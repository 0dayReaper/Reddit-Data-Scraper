    "postText": "Anyone has an ebike while living on campus for trips around town? It seems to fall under the blanket ban on personal motorized vehicles. The most significant problem from what I can tell is the ban on bringing them into residence halls for storage and charging. Any workarounds here? There's no way a bike locked on the street won't get stolen in a week or two, so this would really make it impractical to own one. At the same time, public transit is not so reliable in Baltimore, so I would really like a better way to move around without a car, which is prohibitively expensive to own.",

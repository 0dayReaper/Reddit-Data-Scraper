The TA did all the grading and it was graded leniently I\u2019d say. I got a B+ and an A- on the two essays and ended up with an A in the course (granted I didn\u2019t get my grade for the final exam back but still).",

There\u2019s a couple short readings a week, with one short book we had to read three books we chose from a long list we read as part of our book reports. He gave great book choices and was open to us reading new or different books. He also gave a lot of cool commentary talking about when he did research in china. Really neat guy to talk to and the class is as chill or interesting as you make it. Idk about the grading but I did well, probably because I engaged with the material a lot.",

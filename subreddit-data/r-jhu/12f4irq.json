Is ChemBE and Comp sci as a pre med doable? Or am I not going to have a life?",

It\u2019s rly hard to say whether anything is doable for an incoming freshman. Everyone has different strengths and everyone\u2019s high school experience is different. U just gotta come and see what\u2019s right for u along the way.",

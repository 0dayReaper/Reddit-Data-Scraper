            "comment": "Hey there! I am attending Carey part-time for their graduate program. The education is exactly what I hoped for, I am learning a curated business curriculum and I get to focus on the business of healthcare technology too. The class speakers can be cool, you can hear from people in the industry share their thoughts on a topic and best practices in addition to having an opportunity to ask questions on their journey and challenges they face. \n\nComing from a decade long research career in biotech, I found what I am learning to be super helpful when I got involved at a startup. I regularly apply the leadership, strategy, negotiation, and management skills sets that I have learned to date.  I definitely feel I am better equipped for than I was before attending.  \n\nThere are a number of extracurricular avenues you can get involved in as well for applying your knowledge if you\u2019re full time such as Hexcite or JHTV. I personally would love to get more involved in those but there are not enough hours in the day :)\n\nNow how does it compare to other schools? I am not sure because my experience is only at Carey but I don\u2019t have any regrets. Networking is something I\u2019ve read around as a pain point when I was looking up the school before attending. Happy to say that it is available if you make the effort - and I imagine this is like anywhere else. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten to know and connect with people, while being a part time student, who work in government agencies, Pharma companies, and Big 4 consulting. There\u2019s also a fair amount of recruiters on their handshake service from those organizations and more with multiple internship opportunities throughout the year. \n\nChoice is yours but I would recommend the program for anyone looking to grow as a business professional.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm an incoming freshman at Hopkins planning on majoring in either Neuroscience or Cognitive Science while being on the pre-med track. I'm hoping to finish as many of the pre-med requirements/courses necessary for the MCAT as soon as possible so I have more flexibility later on. \n\nThis is the list I'm thinking about right now:\n\n**Fall 2023:**\n\n* First-Year Seminar (3 credits)\n* Organic Chemistry I (4 credits)\n* Statistics (?)\n* Introduction to Psychology (3 credits)\n* Reintroduction to Writing (3 credits)\n\n**Spring 2024:**\n\n* Organic Chemistry II (4 credits)\n* General Physics II (4 credits)\n* Introduction to Sociology (3 credits)\n* Foundations of Brain Behavior and Cognition (3 credits)\n\n\\*Note: I have AP credits for General Chemistry I and II, Calculus I and II, General Physics I (physical sciences), and General Biology I and II.\n\n**I have these questions:**\n\n* I've looked online, but I can't seem to find the complementary course for AP Statistics at Hopkins (the only one I can find appears to be for an online Hopkins curriculum). Which course should I take?\n* I want to take the lab component of Organic Chemistry in freshman year, along with the actual courses. Does it matter if I do the lab component first semester or second semester?\n* I also took five years of French in high school, and I want to continue in college so that I can become an eloquent speaker. Any suggestions on which year/semester I should take more French classes? If I should take it in freshman year, which other courses currently on my list should I switch those out for?\n* I want to make sure that I'm not taking too many challenging courses in the same semester. \n   * I have a solid foundation in neuroscience by preparing for the National and International Brain Bees (I learned things like neuroanatomy, neurohistology, patient diagnosis, specific areas of the brain, sensory pathways, etc.) However, is it still reasonable to take Orgo II, Physics II, and FBBC all in the same semester? How much workload are they compared to other Hopkins classes? Are there any professors I should avoid/try to get?\n   * Is Intro to Psychology or Intro to Sociology easier, or are they both similar? Does it matter which semester I take each in?\n   * How difficult are Statistics and Reintroduction to Writing compared to other classes?",

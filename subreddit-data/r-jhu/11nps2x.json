    "postText": "Hi everyone. I don\u2019t attend JHU but got accepted to do an internship hosted at the JHU bayview medical campus this summer. \n\n1.) I was wondering how I would go about finding safe housing. As a woman, the surrounding area is slightly alarming so if anyone has any advice on that it would be very helpful thank you so much. \n\n2.) Does anyone have any advice / tips in general to know about Baltimore?\n\nThanks!",

Try not to go too far west from there, though, since that\u2019s where the neighborhoods start getting rough. Also be sure to lock everything and don\u2019t walk around at night, especially alone and with your phone out. You might find better advice at r/Baltimore, though.",

            "comment": "The misconceptions about Baltimore are pretty unfortunate, it's mostly alarming because of the racial history surrounding it, but it's actually a pretty good place; it's pretty much like any other major city. As long as you're careful about what you're doing (like you would in any other major city) you should be fine. There are a lot of places offering subleases near the Med Campus on Facebook, or you could try making a post on this sub for a sublease. I think it would be safe to assume that the housing will be safe since it's from a JHU student that would have stayed there longer than you would be staying there, just ask about their experiences to make sure.",

A friend of mine got robbed last year near inner harbor. You just won\u2019t know the extent of the crime until it happens around you. Additionally, with all those emails from university safety, I\u2019ve never felt safe walking around some area near campus. In the other major city I came from, I can take long walks near the campus and not worry too much about it.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s not an unfortunate misconception. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality.",

If you really want to take a lab (not really required for the mcat) you could just take gen bio with lab or wait to take more upper level classes like cell bio lab, dev genetics lab, or biochem project lab. I think mol bio is still a helpful class to take though",

But for helpful for MCAT, I'd say cell bio. For all those courses you listed, there are going to be a few things that *would* help on the MCAT from each course, but those courses go too in-depth and for the vast majority of content, don't really hit on things that make up the bulk of/are high-yield on the MCAT.",

For example, even though I didn't take Comparative Physiology very seriously (senioritis lol), those concepts definitely have shown up during med school. And Genetics was worth it for me since I'm into genomics, but is by no means necessary. Didn't take Cell Bio, but honestly might be worthwhile cuz I went into med school not having any understanding of signal transduction and all that stuff seems like \"i like your funny words magic man\" to me",

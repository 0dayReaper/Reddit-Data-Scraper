    "postText": "With FAFSA, they protect like 7k and then take 50% of the stuff after it, but with CSS, its super vague and we use CSS, not FAFSA soooo. I was wondering should I have some money saved up to pay for the inevitable tuition increase or should I spend it all cuz when they see that money saved up, they'll take a good chunk of it, vs when they see there is no more money saved up, they won't take any? Or does your INCOME itself affect it, not just the money you saved up from the internship?\nCould anyone with experience with this please lmk how it affected financial aid?\n\nThank you",

And what about the money that you wanna spend for yourself and family lol, it sucks being poor your entire life and then finally getting money but spending it all on tuition and HCOL area",

I would talk to Fin Aid and your success advisor about how work and income will affect your aid (also try the cost calculator). They can't predict it fully, but they can probably give some advice. It also depends a lot on what your parents make.",

    "postText": "For all premed students applying to med schools this cycle!\n\nWHITE COAT PATHWAYS has launched as a student-first medical school admissions consulting service that is AFFORDABLE, PROFESSIONAL, and COMPREHENSIVE.\n\nThe med school application process can be daunting, not only because of the countless essays and interviews, but also because the common professional guidance often costs thousands of dollars.\n\nFounded by a JHU alum and incoming Harvard medical student, WCP is committed to providing affordable, high-quality med school application assistance. We utilize a low-cost approach and our own recent experiences successfully completing the application process to mentor pre-med students on the pathway to their white coats.\n\nPlease visit our [website](https://whitecoatpathways.com/) to view services and schedule a free consult! (Currently, items in packages are flexible to meet applicant needs)",

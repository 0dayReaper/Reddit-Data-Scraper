But then I scrolled further and saw this. \n\n\nI wanna hear from the MSE's in this sub about how you afford this school. Bachelor's and PhDs make a bit of sense to me, but I honestly can't imagine how any sane person would accept an MSE offer that looks like this.\n\n\nHow many MSEs get consistent TAships/RAships at this school? What other options are out there? Please, I really don't want to give up on this school",

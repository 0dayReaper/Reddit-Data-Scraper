    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI am going to be applying for the undergrad class of 2028 and am looking to major in international relations. My ultimate goal would be to one day be admitted into one of the Hopkins' international studies schools such as the  Paul H. Nitze School in DC. My question is if I were to be admitted into undergrad, would that increase my chances of being admitted into one of their grad schools down the line provided my academic record is good enough?\n\nThanks in advance!",

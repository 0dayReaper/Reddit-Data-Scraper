    "postText": " \n\nSo I applied to Hopkins for ED II as an intl student.\n\nUp until yesterday, the financial aid section of the protal showed my CSS as \"Received\" and my proof of citizenship as \"waived\" (obviously I am not a U.S. citizen so I emailed them about it and they waived the requirement). When I logged in to the portal yesterday afternoon, the proof of citizenship requiremet had disappeared.\n\nAnd just now, when I logged in again, my regular checklist (the one that inlcudes transcript, LORs, etc) had also disappeared completely.\n\nRight now, I am only able to see my certificate of finances and my submitted CSS profile requirement.\n\nAny other students who applied to JHU for ED II or RD experiencing the same thing?",

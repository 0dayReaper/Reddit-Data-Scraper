    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m an ED admit to the Class of 2027, and unfortunately I have an 83 in AP chem right now, which will be reported in my midterm progress report. Last semester, I ended with an 87, and I am wondering if this grade is low enough for serious consequences. I definitely plan on improving my grade next semester, and my teacher has said he will provide more opportunities for extra credit next semester.\n\nThanks for your help!",

And even if they do, it usually follows a significant decrease in performance (i.e. A/B student suddenly consistently getting Cs and Ds)\n\nGrades matter a lot less than many people say they do. Your merits outside of classes honestly matter a lot more to an admissions office.\n\n\nCongratulations for getting in and enjoy being a second semester senior. You only get to experience it twice",

    "postText": "I want to get into chip design and it seems like a must to have a masters to break into those roles.  I was wondering if anyone in the engineering professionals program would be able to share their thoughts on the quality of the program (Forget about costs, I have employer assistance). For about the next year or two there is absolutly no way I can't be working full time so at least starting online is a must for me. The selection of classes in the ep program seems to be far wider than any other program I have found. But that almost sketches me out a bit, along with some other things I've seen people comment about ep classes not being rigouris. For those in ep courses, would you say the courses are of the same quality as traditional college courses? Other options I've been looking at were ASU, Purdue, Texas A+M, Minnesotta. They dont have as wide of a selection but their courses seemed to be just \"regular\" courses that they offer online, and the applications to the program are a little more involved with letters of rec and all that that makes it seem more like a regular masters. Do you guys see any reason an M.S.E from one of those programs would be more worthwile than JHU's EP program? I want to take \"legit\" hard classes that go very deep into the topic as grad courses should be. I dont want some surface level udemy, coursea coverage of content.",

            "comment": "Also I know the EP progrmas are taught by APL faculty and seemingly whoever else they can find with appropriate qualifications... Which is sort of were my sketched out attidude stems from. I just want to know that these guys+gals arn't sandbagging and skipping typical course content or problems/assignments because they think people with full time jobs deserve more slack.",

            "comment": "Took two courses (Multirate DSP and SoC FPGA) from the ECE EP program. I was also sketched out because it was an online program but based on the two classes I took, I\u2019d say it\u2019s legit. Definitely not Udemy type classes. Felt like actual rigor classes. They also focus on having you use software to solve problems like in an actual work environment. ECE courses at JHU mainly have online pre-recorded lectures, and every week is termed a module where each module has homework, lectures, book/paper readings, and discussion posts.",

I took it with Doug (great guy) and his version of the course used VHDL, Xilinx Signal Processing IP blocks, Zynq FPGA with ARM processor. Also learned about Petalinux and Ethernet. I\u2019d recommend that class. Also the Computer Architecture class where they build a processor in an FPGA",

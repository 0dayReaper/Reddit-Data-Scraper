    "postText": "Hello all,  I'm enrolled in the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program at Hopkins but was hoping to take a few classes at SAIS. Generally interested in foreign affairs/diplomacy and particularly in humanitarian response or country case studies. Does anyone have particular favorite classes that they'd like to recommend? I feel like every school has at least a few \"legendary\" courses, just curious for some highlights. Appreciate any advice!",

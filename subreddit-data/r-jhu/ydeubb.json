    "postText": "The most recent security alert:\n\n&gt;Homewood Public Safety was just made aware of an armed robbery of an affiliate. \u00a0Baltimore Police are investigating the robbery that occurred in the **100 block of West University Parkway** on October 24, 2022, at about 11:15 PM.\u00a0 An affiliate reported that while walking in the 100 block of West University Parkway, he was approached by three males in a black Acura. The males then asked the victim to get into the vehicle. When the victim refused, the three males exited the car and approached the victim.\u00a0 All three subjects were armed with handguns.\u00a0One of the subjects struck the affiliate, who was then forced into their vehicle.\u00a0**The subjects took the victims cell phone and drove the victim to several ATM\u2019s at unknown locations, where cash was withdrawn**. The victim was then driven to Charles Street and University Parkway and let out of the vehicle. The vehicle was last seen driving west on University Parkway.\u00a0The victim was provided medical attention today by Baltimore City Fire Department. \n\nViolent crimes are encroaching upon a neighborhood which has been quite safe in the past years.  The university is not doing enough to protect its students. Is there anything we can do to stop these crimes?",

Students should not have to worry about their safety as they are here to learn. But unfortunately for these criminals all they want to do is to unjustly rob property from the already burdened students. Hope the criminals will face consequences in no time. And criminals, or criminals-to-be, if you are reading this, you should probably stop your plan because JHU is not a place for you to grab what you want, there are better ways to earn things rightly, by hard work.\n\nAnd I agree with the comments that latest mannerism against JHPD has made criminals feel \"safer\" to get around campus. I don't see the points with these though because private police surely are doing things, just we have to realize that they do not completely eliminate all the potential dangers, but some few sentimental just interpret this as like the police is not doing enough. Imagine a JHU campus without security guards would go totally wild.",

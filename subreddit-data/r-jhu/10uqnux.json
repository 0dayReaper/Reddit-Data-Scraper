I would say the CS courses can be interesting but the homeworks are long with lackluster instruction/guidelines on grading",

            "comment": "This is really hard to answer when you ask it like this, it would be a lot easier if you had specific questions in mind. The standard curriculum is pretty much like anywhere else. Some really good classes, some classes that make your soul want to leave your body. If you want to do research, there are plenty of opportunities and especially machine learning focused on speech, NLP, bio-imaging are world-class. Doing a double major with AMS/CogSci/Econ is relatively easy if you are into that. \n\nIf you just want a high earning job at big tech right out of undergrad I see a lot of people joining these types of companies so there is always that option and they recruit here, just not in the same magnitude as some other huge schools due to the low amount of undergrad population. In both cases you will need to work hard and not rely on the school, though that is the same everywhere. \n\nWhich other schools do you have in mind and what are your goals?",

            "comment": "Definitely a solid program. Some places my JHU CS friends ended up going: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, MIT PhD, NYU med, etc. Myself: medical school.\n\nI was initially a bio/neuro major but switched to CS, so I can speak to how the CS program compares to other programs at JHU. It is more collaborative and more focused on active learning through problem sets and projects rather than the typical lecture + exam format. Smaller class sizes. Plenty of peers working on cool things. And there are many opportunities at JHU to do work in exciting applications of CS, like genomics and natural language processing.\n\nOf course, a school like MIT or CMU is likely better for CS (especially for machine learning), but JHU CS is a very solid program.",

            "comment": "Some context: I was not a STEM major, it's been like 10 years since I graduated and the single CS course I took I dropped at the absolute last day I could without a penalty, roughly 6-8 weeks IIRC. \n\nI took a java course and the professor did pretty much nothing to help me learn and understand the material during lecture. All the assignments and tests, of which I had one major exam, were all about writing code that could actually perform a given task/ prompt. With the immense amount of reading I had to do, I didn't have time to fuck around for 12 hours figuring it out on my own, so I dropped it.\n\nAll that being said, if you like what I've just described and feel up for that kind of challenge, I think it can be a very rewarding program, and I'm sure there are many TAs and even a couple of professors who will help you if you demonstrate a genuine effort and desire to learn. In hindsight, I wish I was able to stick it out because it wasn't that hard; I just wanted to give my time to different things.\n\n Again, not a STEM major but that was my limited experience.\n\nBest of luck with your decision.",

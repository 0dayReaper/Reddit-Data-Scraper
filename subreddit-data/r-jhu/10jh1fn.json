I was wondering if anybody currently taking this minor would be willing to share their experiences regarding just how hands-on it is, how well it can integrate into JHU's neuroscience curriculum, and generally how you all like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Especially, there needs to be a strong background in Kinematics, Dynamics, linear algebra, and programming. After switching to an engineering major, my major requirements covered these areas, and i was able to gain more hands-on design experience that i would have missed if I had taken lecture-style courses. But, everyone has different capabilities, and I'm sure some students have been able to complete Neuroscience (or equally intensive KSAS degree) with Robotics. I would ask the Robotics advisor for references if any students have done it in the past!",

I'll make sure to ask their advisor about previous students to see if any other KSAS students have done it, especially for pre-med.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I do have a quick question regarding the background knowledge needed to take those more hands-on classes: my school's math and physics curriculum is pretty rigorous, and I will (hopefully) have passed Physics C: Mechanics, Physics C: E&amp;M, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, as well as the basics of Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra by the time I graduate. How much would you say these cover out of the prerequisites, if anything?",

But, some of the upper level Robotics courses require specific prerequistes (such as, \"Robot Devices Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control\" and \"Sensor-based Robotics\") that are not covered in general math courses. \n\nI tried to keep my credit load per semester to the minimum as possible, so I was able to complete the prerequisites through the Mechanical Engineering requirements and over many semesters (so my case may be a little different! \ud83d\ude05)",

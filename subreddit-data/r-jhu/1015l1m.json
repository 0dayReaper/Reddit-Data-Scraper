            "comment": "How good a major is for someone is always relative to their goals, and imo mat sci is fantastic for those interested in going to grad school. The workload is tough like all engineering disciplines, but it's definitely not as bad as some of the other ones and you will have plenty of time for other things like research. W/regards to research, there are tons of opportunities since materials can be found anywhere, so you'll be able to do everything from batteries to biomaterials to metallurgy, among other things. Most of the professors are nice people, and the classes are interesting for the most part.",

Workload can be tough, but in my experience it gets a lot easier once you make it out of the pre reqs.",

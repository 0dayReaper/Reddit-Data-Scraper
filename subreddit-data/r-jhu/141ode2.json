    "postText": "Hey y'all. I am a rising senior trying to decide which colleges to apply to for CS. I've heard a lot of mixed sentiments concerning the CS program at JHU (courses overbooked, glitches, etc), but am still thinking of applying because I'm interested in CS + Health (like AI in medical imaging).\n\nI wanted to ask---\n\n1. What type of student should pursue CS @ JHU?\n2. What makes the program different from other CS programs (in good or bad ways)?\n3. Are research opportunities present for CS undergrads in medical AI?\n4. Professors---Are you able to make close relationships with them? Do you feel like you're genuinely learning, or are missing out/confused most of the time?\n5. How's the location (weather, partying, etc.)?\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I graduated 5 years ago so take what I say with a grain of salt. \n\n&gt;1. What type of student should pursue CS @ JHU?\n\nI don't know how to answer this. You have to be willing to work hard. Beyond that I wouldn't say there's one type of student who will succeed in this program. \n\n&gt;2. What makes the program different from other CS programs (in good or bad ways)?\n\n- It's a smaller program which means you have more access to resources, professors, research opportunities, etc. \n\n- For a small class there are a lot of really cool classes and world class professors. Particularly in ML, NLP, cybersecurity, and robotics.\n\n- it doesn't have as many industry connections as other programs. Some larger companies recruit out of Hopkins but we're not a recruiting powerhouse like other schools\n\n&gt;3. Are research opportunities present for CS undergrads in medical AI?\n\nYes\n\n&gt;4. Professors---Are you able to make close relationships with them? \n\nDefine close. There are some professors I worked with who I felt like I knew reasonably well and who cared in my success. But these were mostly professors I worked with as a TA.\n\n&gt;Do you feel like you're genuinely learning, or are missing out/confused most of the time?\n\nI genuinely learned a lot in my coursework. But I had to work hard. College is about figuring out how to teach yourself more than anything else. Professors will lecture but the onus is on you to figure out how you consume information and how you can make yourself successful.\n\n&gt;5. How's the location (weather, partying, etc.)?\n\nIt's fine. I don't think Baltimore is the most active city but there's a lot to do in the city and in DC (which is 45min away). In terms of partying, there are frats and student groups who throw parties on or near campus, but Hopkins is the kind of school where most people put academics first. So you may find folks in the library on a Friday night instead of out partying if they have exams or projects or whatever coming up. \n\nIn terms of weather, it gets cold and snowy in Baltimore but not as bad as New York or New England.",

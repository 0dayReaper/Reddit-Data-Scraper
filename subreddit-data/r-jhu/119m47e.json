    "postText": "Recently I am very fortunate to get into  JHU Masters in BME and UPenn Masters in BioEngineering, both in Bioinformatics track. The most important things for me are: 1. Career prospective/How easy to find a job? 2. The living condition (safety, cost, overall quality of living). What are people thoughts on these two points between JHU and UPenn? Any input is helpful, thanks a lot.",

            "comment": "Got into JHU and UPenn before too, masters but not in BME so I can't comment on future job prospects. If you mean jobs inside Hopkins, the school's literally filled with research jobs all the time. As for living situations, the cost is comparable although I'm essentially getting about a year free at Hopkins. I don't remember that Penn offered me anything.\n\nLiving conditions-wise, it's ehh if i'm being honest -- I worked outside the US for some years so I say that relative to my experience abroad and in a couple of other states. I know a lot of people who like it here, but they also have cars and don't have to deal with life's inconveniences so... there's that. It's not terrible and the people are great, especially outside Hopkins (unless you like talking about research a lot, if so then you'd find a crowd). Cost of living (i.e. mainly rent) is great if you know how/where to look.\n\nI don't regret choosing Hopkins and I probably wouldn't choose Penn over it for my program specifically, but I would have probably spent more time considering another university I got into under another program. The education here is great really and the students are immensely talented. My issue is more the quality of life -- having to go through a fast-paced term system, being expected to do work/research 25/7, and this overall grind culture that permeates the academic space. That works for a lot of folks, I just realized it's not necessarily something I prioritze for myself.",

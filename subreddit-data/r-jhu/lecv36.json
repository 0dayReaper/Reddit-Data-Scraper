    "postText": "Like wtf, do frat people have a condition where they just fucking die if a party is not thrown? What kind of sad, degenerate alcoholic horny people are you if you can\u2019t make a week of not keeping it in your pants/getting wasted? Like hey man, I like to have fun and party too, BUT FUCKING WAIT UNTIL THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. Like holy shit can we please not cause an orgy of viruses that will shut the goddamn school down and make everyone\u2019s life miserable? Also, to the braindead freshmen who decided it\u2019s a great idea to go to these parties, please don\u2019t. I know it\u2019s y\u2019all first year in college and y\u2019all wanna enjoy it, but hey, we have a fucked up situation called COVID and if you don\u2019t want to comply with the guidelines, then shame on you and gtfo the campus. Prestigious school for pre med and public health my ass, I\u2019m going to a school full of horny alcohol fueled potatoes fml. You fucktards are being inconsiderate pricks to the others who have lives at risk and most of all, y\u2019all are just fucking inconveniencing me. Like wtf, now I have to go get tested for an extra session for a total of three instead of two. Fucking wasting my precious energy to go an extra time. Also y\u2019all cancelled my club activities that I was looking forward to. Woohoo let\u2019s make everyone\u2019s lives more miserable amirite. Like dude, you can have fun and get drunk without partying. Here I am, stuck inside eating stale cereal and sipping on some cheap vodka and having a good time watching some league of legends streams and having  blast. I know it doesn\u2019t sound fun in words but just try it, it\u2019s actually enjoyable. Don\u2019t want to drink alone? No problem, zoom call or discord call in a group and drink together and see who blacks out first. Or just drink with your roommates. If you\u2019re horny, just watch some fucking porn or something or FaceTime someone and have phone sex or whatever. Don\u2019t fuck your roommates because that\u2019s just desperate and weird but you get my point Like Jesus, can y\u2019all just not make me so angry. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I just want to have have my school year return the way it used to be but these idiots are ruining my golden dream of returning to a less miserable time. I know all frats aren\u2019t like this and some are keeping respectful boundaries but those convenience store knobheads of wawa and others just irk me. If y\u2019all are gonna keep partying, do me a favor and just kill me because you are just making me feel more depressed when I hear about it. \n\nTLDR: just me ranting about those COVID spreading frat morons",

Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing video games. I used to be a competitive gamer and I used to do this. After joining the Greek system, partying became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape society. There have even been studies that show how necessary gatherings are for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state. People are giving us so much crap for it, yet they don't know what it's like for us to be deprived of everything that's fun for us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/hpm2hq/a\\_frat\\_guy\\_at\\_my\\_university\\_had\\_a\\_meltdown\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/hpm2hq/a_frat_guy_at_my_university_had_a_meltdown_that/)",

There\u2019s no reason to think Hopkins would be different for some reason just cuz we\u2019ve got a half-decent medical school. This holier-than-thou shit is certainly no way to get anyone on your side or concerned for your safety though. No college kids are gonna sit around and have a whole year\u2019s worth of fun taken from them, as shitty as it is to say, it\u2019s a fact of reality. It\u2019s ridiculous to act like this wasn\u2019t gonna happen and get all butthurt when it does, because all the evidence said it would",

Also pretty disappointed seeing the Narc-y vibe of this sub, but less surprised. Literally the only thing that is going to let their be allowed parties again is distribution of the vaccine. These parties just affect the current on-campus stuff that is only happening cause Hopkins put money over public health...",

I have a lab im committed to (but my study is pausing for summer) so I don\u2019t want to join a new lab but I want to stay for the summer to do some research (and get paid if possible) but it seems like most labs want someone to commit longer term",

            "comment": "Honestly just ask the lab you are working with now. They don't always have funding for undergrads. But professors are for the most part pretty supportive of undergrad research over the summer if they have the funds. The fact that you are working with them now means that you are a valued part of the lab. If you want to find other labs obviously that's just a matter of asking around. You'd be surprised at how helpful profs are at helping you with this. At the very least you will get good advice on how to find paid research.",

Not sure if that's what you're into, but here's one that was sent to me:   \n\n\n[https://engineering.virginia.edu/sysbioreu](https://engineering.virginia.edu/sysbioreu)  \n\n\nApplication deadline is April 8th. You can also look on some NSF website for a list of them and there might be a few left open for application.",

    "postText": "Hello, I will be applying to JHU for an English PhD (the faculty seem amazing, and they are ranked very high in English so double-score!) but I am having difficulty with the vagueness of the application--would someone mind helping me out?  Information about me: I am a 4.0 MPW student with a research paper presented at a top conference and another paper, the one I am thinking to submit to this school, is being reviewed for a hopeful publication! I am also extremely into animation media/lit. studies, the rhetoric of science, and cultural studies of minority groups--my paper deals with the latter two, but my favorite field is queer media studies.\n\nSo, the page ([Admissions | English | Johns Hopkins University (jhu.edu)](https://english.jhu.edu/graduate/admissions/) states that we need to have a writing sample, which is, of course, unsurprising, but it doesn't give any guidelines on what they sort of expect out of it like many other schools have other than that it needs to be a critical paper and not creative writing and no more than 25 pages. I tried to find more details and I found this site that seems to suggest that they just want you to submit your BEST critical writing piece (making it sound like they aren't being strict that it needs to 100% match your fields of interest) but the kicker is that it seems like the site hasn't been updated for, uh, a while, therefore I am wondering if I should go by that site or something else? I worry emailing would make me sound incompetent and they would have my name under a no-accept radar (applying anxiety is real).\n\nHere is the old page that I found that I mentioned above:  [Graduate Education | Samples of Work (jh.edu)](https://pages.jh.edu/design/oliver/graduate%20web%20site/admissions/samples.htm)\n\nThank you so much! I really do hope it is that they prefer your best sample, which does have a general connection to my interest, but not super closely, however, I think it shows that I can properly handle those subject matters, and in the case of the paper, the topics of race and gender.",

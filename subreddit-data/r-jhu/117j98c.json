For example, Gertrudes at the BMA could be considered the \"go to\" for faculty and administrator dining, and it happens to have excellent food, attentive service and reasonable prices. \n\nHowever, the former Hopkins Club (which closed during covid and didn't re-open) probably would have been a reasonable answer a few years ago.",

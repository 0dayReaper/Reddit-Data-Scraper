    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019ve seen a few recent posts on this sub asking for apartment advice, and I imagine people are starting to look for apartments with classes returning to an in-person format.\n\nIn light of this, I was hoping to offer a bit of a warning about certain apartments near campus, specifically the Broadview Apartments. If you have been looking to live at Broadview, I would recommend that you look elsewhere. A lot of tenants, including myself, have been pretty disappointed/upset with the way the building has been managed this past year. \n\nBasically, the management is slow to respond to issues, and there is often a huge lack of transparency between management and tenants. At times, it even feels like the management is blatantly trying to ripoff its tenants. For instance, I noticed that I had been double-charged for certain utilities over the past few months, but when I brought it up to the management they insisted that there weren\u2019t any issues until I had walked them through the math in my bills at least ten times (I wish I were exaggerating). This is just one example of many similar issues.\n\nFeel free to take this all with a grain of salt; unfortunately it\u2019s not too uncommon for landlords/property managers to run their businesses dishonestly. That being said, if you are looking for housing near campus, there apartments/townhouses that are leased by family-owned companies, and I have heard they take much more pride their properties/tenants. Just my two cents.",

            "comment": "I second this. I just graduated and moved out a month ago. Before new management took over at the start of the year, everything was in line with what you would expect with the price point. Maintenance has always been slow, but where is it not. Parking prices are expensive, but at least it has the option. Etc etc\n\nBut this new management was something else. I had the same issue of them trying to overcharge us. They failed to set up trash disposal until a literal mountain of trash had accumulated in the basement- truly a health hazard. \n\nI know it\u2019s a cheap apartment, but if I were to do it now, I\u2019d either spend more on a different apartment or spend the same/less on a townhouse. Broadview is the worst of all worlds.",

Management is horrible, communication with them is super slow and inconsistent, maintenance is super rude and will knock loudly on your door without warning or letting you know when they will be coming. The front office people have no idea what they're doing and the general manager is always busy so she's never available to talk about issues. Stay away from this place!",

            "comment": "I cannot agree with this more. I have lived in broadview for 5 years and I am moving out this summer, because enough is enough. \r  \n1. water bill\r  \nThere was a pipe burst in December 2020. The water went for 2 days and flooded the lobby and basement. We had no water at all for a whole 24 hrs and no hot water for a week, so we could not take shower and wash things for a week. Remember it was winter and pandemic was ongoing. Somewhat the management put the charges of repair and wasted water on the residents. This is the reason for doubled or tripled water bill, and we have months of surged water bills. \r  \n2. heater\r  \nYou need your own heater if you want to live here. The heater of the building will be turned on only when it is 32 degree (0 centigrade). Yet most time, the heater will not turn on even if the temperature is below 32. A resident brought this issue to the management, and they dare to reply that the heater is mainly for the building's systems to remain operational, but not for the residents.\r  \nThey do state that the ac in the unit can be used as heater in winter. However, the ac is so old that it cannot raise the temperature, and you will get enormous electricity bill if you use it.\r  \n3. trash\r  \nNow the management says they no longer recycle plastic and glass, only cardboard. All plastic and glass go into trash. Hence you will have a lot of trash. But you cannot throw trash if the dumpsters are full. You need to wait for the dumpster to be empty to throw trash. This means you cannot decide when to throw trash on your own, and you probably cannot throw trash on weekend, because the dumpsters are full almost always. Yet you paid for trash fee every month.\r  \n\r  \nAll problems above have been complained about, and you can find these in the Google comments. But the management does not bother to improve or resolve the problems. If you send emails regarding these problems, you will NEVER get their reply. Yet they have no problem sending emails for rent reminder and trash penalty for $100. Also, I notice they say they have in-unit washer/dryer and island kitchen, but I believe most rooms have no such things, only the penthouse units have those. In sum, do not get mislead by the cheap price and fancy common area. You will get what you pay for.",

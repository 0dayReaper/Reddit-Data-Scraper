I will be staying on campus for a few weeks and am really concerned about not having access to a gym or pool, as I was planning to lift and swim to train for waterpolo. Does anyone know of ways to access the rec center without being a student at jhu, or of any pools or gyms in the area? Any ideas are greatly appreciated :))",

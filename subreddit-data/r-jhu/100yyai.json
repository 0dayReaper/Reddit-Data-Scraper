            "comment": "First of all, props on wanting to get ahead during intersession. My suggestion (as one of the faculty that is involved in the Gateway program) is to do the following:\n\n-First: don't fret! The goal of the course is to teach you the basics of coding and logical thinking. It is expected that some students have never coded before! \n\n-Second: If you have had no experience before with coding, find some (very) basic tutorials and start to get your feet wet. Type a 'Hello World' script, try a loop, do something simple that interests you! I recommend video tutorials, as the pace is a little slower and can get you started.\n\n-Third: Reach out to the professor of your section! I guarantee that they have more resources (such as the installation process for python and associated libraries, examples, textbooks, etc.) and should be open to helping.\n\nHope this helps guide your process!",

            "comment": "I took this class a few semesters ago, I would just like to point out that while this is advertised as a beginner course, it isn\u2019t super beginner friendly. Quizzes are automatically graded by this program called zybooks and parts of projects are automatically graded by gradescope. They get super finicky and unnecessary uncompromising, often not giving credit when the code works fine in python. Not to mention that I\u2019ve shared the work I did with a CS major at Carnegie Mellon, who said this was way harder than his first coding class for CS majors that he took there (it\u2019s considered one of the best schools for computer science). Which is why it especially sucks that there\u2019s no alternate \u201cintro\u201d class for non majors, even though there are in most schools. If u want a more traditional learning experience, I would definitely suggest learning as much as possible on YouTube. My professor expected everyone to learn most of the material through zybooks tutorials, and then added on some more difficult material in class without much review, which was a learning style that personally did not work for me. If it\u2019s not required for you\u2019re program, I wouldn\u2019t recommend gateway.",

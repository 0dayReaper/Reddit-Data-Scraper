            "comment": "I'm an AAP Masters alum, in a different program. I would describe the programs as rigorous and well-respected, but not necessarily selective. \n\nFrom the research I did before choosing the JHU program, the online/professional type programs seem to choose rigor over selectivity. Even Harvard's extension school lets all applicants matriculate, and then weeds them out throughout the program rather than paring down the applications. \n\nHope that helps!",

I applied anyways with very low hopes since I was going directly from undergrad to grad school, and got in. The courses in my program (MS Food Safety Regulation) are very very rigorous.",

It is my understanding that JHU doesn\u2019t give grad students financial aid like scholarships and they don\u2019t offer teaching assistantships so aside from loans there is no help. Are you all just paying $60k a year? \ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm considering taking on a Behavioral Bio major, but a lot of the classes I would want to do requires FBBC, as such I'm wondering what the course load is like/exams and content because I would be taking FBBC while I'm taking biochem and physics and while I'm studying for MCAT, so I just want to know if it's worth it or to just continue with the easy way of being a psych major.",

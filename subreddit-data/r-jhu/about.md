Description:

Subreddit for all things related to the Johns Hopkins University and affiliates. 

Come here to post and see news related to all facets of the Johns Hopkins universe.

Rules:

Personal Information: No personal information about any students, no trash talk, no hate threads. If you do not comply, your post will be removed. Multiple violations will result in a ban. This also includes links to personal info which may or may not be your own. Even if you post your own info or claim to have permission, if we have no way to verify that, then it is not allowed. (Publicly available email addresses are okay)

Keep Discussion Civil: Feel free to talk about sensitive issues, but please keep it civil. No name calling, pointless off-topic arguing, trolling, or deliberately inciting controversy.

Related to JHU: Posts should be somehow related to Hopkins, the campus, or the surrounding Baltimore area, please.

"Chance-me" / Generic Admissions Questions: No "chance-me"-type posts asking "what are my chances of being accepted into JHU?" or other vague and generic college admissions questions. Please take those questions to websites like College Confidential, /r/ApplyingToCollege, or /r/chanceme. If you post it here, it will be removed. See this comment for the reason why: https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/2x7650/jhu_admissions_process/coxk8va

Referral Links: Referral links are not specifically disallowed, but only if you are transparent that you are using a referral link or code AND ALSO post a non-referral link as an alternate option. (People will actually be more likely to use your code if you provide a choice, rather than think you are trying to trick them into giving you something for free.)

Low-Effort Posts: No excessively **low-effort posts**. (such as one word answers or trolling)

Posts spammed to many college or similar subreddits: Mods discretion (based on the community's response) will be used for posts which are spammed to many college or similar subreddits. (such as generic surveys) Please report these if it contains content you do not want to see on r/jhu.

Search for past questions before posting: Incoming freshman often ask the same exact questions every year in a flood of posts. Please **make a effort to search the subreddit for past questions before posting**. Repeat posts may be removed based on community response and mod discretion. (For example if the question was posted so long ago that the answers may have changed, it can be asked again.)

Misinformation or Unsubstantiated Claims: Do not post misinformation or unsubstantiated claims, in a way that is misleading to the readers.

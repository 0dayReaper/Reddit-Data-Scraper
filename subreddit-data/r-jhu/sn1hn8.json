I guess she kinda realized that I was about to start bawling my eyes out and she was nice ish the rest of the time. Yes the second I walked away I started crying\n\nTy for listening to my Ted-talk",

It happens sometimes. It can feel really upsetting and embarrassing, I totally get it. I try to remember in these situations that it's not anything I did, but that person is probably just going through their own thing or not realizing how they come across to others. Thinking this way usually gives me a bit of peace of mind, hope it can be of some help to you as well. Maybe do something nice for yourself today, or pass along some kindness to someone else, it might help you feel better :)",

One time the lady in Mudd Hall was mad I didn't wait enough after the previous person went and did not treat me great. However, she treated me well other times, but I avoid the Mudd Hall cafe because that one time I felt uneasy.",

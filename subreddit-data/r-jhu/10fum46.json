Wang and Linear Algebra for Data Science (AMS new course) with Micheli\n\n**Other info**: Totaling 15 credits for the semester (other 2 classes are econ), took Calc 2 last semester and got an A-\n\nIs this doable for an AMS major? Or should I  take LADS and Discrete Math even though that would give me an awkward 1-hr gap in the morning every MWF?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10fum46)",

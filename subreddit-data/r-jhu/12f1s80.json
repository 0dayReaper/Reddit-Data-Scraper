I know someone who chose Hopkins over MIT, another over Yale, and yet another who chose it over Stanford for similar reasons.",

I went into the application season feeling like I would prefer liberal arts colleges more, but ended up changing my mind last minute because LACs are mostly in the middle of no where\u2026 Don\u2019t regret Hopkins however because of abundance of research opportunities and also a culture I\u2019m more comfortable with. Bowdoin was overwhelmingly white, im a minority so this was a little intimidating when I visited.",

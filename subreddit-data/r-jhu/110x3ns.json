The buildings just have the one common area that's kinda out of the way so people don't really hang out there. \n\nHowever, the stereotypes don't always play out. I've seen Wolman floors that are completely dead and years where the buildings are really active. And keep in mind that where you live is just that - you can always hang out with friends on any floor. I remember my freshman year there were a few people who hung out on our floor more than some folks who actually lived there.",

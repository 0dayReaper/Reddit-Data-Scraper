    "postText": "So I am fortunate in having gotten into JHU under Molecular and Cellular Bio and I\u2019m pre-med, but I have a few concerns. I heard JHU pre-med is super duper competitive between its premeds and worry that my experience will muddled with intense competition making it harder to be successful. I\u2019m also interested in taking classes for fun and out of interest, but worry that isn\u2019t really a thing at JHU. I was curious if anyone who is on a STEM path but has other interests has been able to support both at JHU. Any other comments on being pre med with or without Mol/Cec major are greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

I wouldn\u2019t worry about the competition - there will be a lot of other pre meds but Hopkins has tons of research opportunities to go around and classes are generally the same level of difficulty anywhere since it\u2019s the same material.",

Everyone is struggling in some way since the premed reqs are all difficult at any institution so people just try to help each other out. It's really easy to take classes for fun here. In my case, I could just take one premed req each year to have all my reqs done, and all of the other classes are for my major/for fun (I've explored comp sci, econ, and art history), it's really nice.",

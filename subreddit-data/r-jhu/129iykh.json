    "postText": " Hi everyone, I recently got admitted to the Biotechnology Program at Johns Hopkins University, and I am thrilled to start this journey. I was wondering if any alumni from the program could help me out with some questions that I have. Here are a few that come to mind:\n\n1. What did you enjoy most about the program?\n2. How did the program prepare you for your career in biotechnology?\n3. Were there any particularly challenging aspects of the program that you think I should be aware of?\n4. Are there any specific courses that you found particularly useful?\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to help me out, I really appreciate it!",

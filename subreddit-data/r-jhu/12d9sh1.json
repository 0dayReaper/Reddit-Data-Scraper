    "postText": "for context, i\u2019m planning on majoring in cognitive science or psychology or neuroscience and following the premed track. i\u2019ve only been to the jhu campus and that was only because i got aid for it. i loved the campus and i love the opportunities, but my main concern when committing to jhu is student life. since im planning on going to medical school, i know i\u2019ll be sacrificing a decade of my life to constant study at the medical school and residency level. jhu is the best academically and offers the most opportunities for extracurriculars in terms of research and internships, but i also want to enjoy my undergrad and have some free time outside of my academic pursuits. im probably gonna commit to jhu, it is certainly a dream, but i want some assurance that students do have a life outside of academics. i\u2019ve heard about balancing time and putting effort into your social life, and if i go i certainly will try my hardest, but after my visit i find myself more hesitant than before to fully commit. is hopkins worth it? do you guys have fun? are you happy with your decision?",

Definetly love Washington! There are people here who seem that all they do is study but overtime I\u2019ve tried to break apart from that culture because really you only get this experience once living so close to friends, going to explore the city on a random day of the week, and I definitely enjoy staying busy with extracurriculars here like dance! No matter where you go be open to explore and take up new or maintain hobbies as they make the process way more fulfilling. \n\nFor GW, I\u2019d honestly only consider it if it\u2019s comparably the same price as attending JHU if not I\u2019d be a little on the edge cuz Washington is very expensive to live in and I\u2019d rather you save money for med school. And like I said you can still enjoy Washington by taking a morning train from Baltimore by Marc for $6.\n\nUF is literally a collegetown like any collegetown it has its pros and cons but there\u2019s nowhere else to go but your university and some bars. I was extremely hesitant to choose UF because of these reasons but if it is cheaper option for you and you like people that go there then sure. But I\u2019d def outweigh UF just because it really is cool research and extracurriculars you can do here at JHU at the Hopkins hospital to be precise. From what I\u2019ve heard tho, my friends at UF seem to enjoy it but not necessarily anymore than I\u2019m enjoying Hopkins. Those who hate Hopkins just never tried to expand on their experiences and do more with their time here in my opinion. It can get depressing sure cuz of the studying but studying for premed is hard/time-consuming at most top schools if not most schools in general. \n\nBe prepared wherever you go to make the most out of it and figure out a way to break from the study all day culture and be ready to meet new people!",

It\u2019s kinda like a build your own major you can focus in two areas: psychology, computing, philosophy linguistics or neuroscience at the same time! And there\u2019s so much flexibility to do a double major/ minor so if you wanna take more classes you can and get another major/minor from it especially with cog sci that has so few reqs. I highly value flexibility in what I study makes the four years of undergrad more for you to enjoy based on your interests unlike lots of other schools (UF has that unique psychology program but it doesn\u2019t compare). just my opinion tho lol",

            "comment": "I'll preface this by saying that now that I am less than 2 months out from graduation, I absolutely do not regret it.  I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I've been given here and ultimately would not go back 4 years and change my decision.  That said, there are a few things I wish I would have known:\n\n1. Pre-med is not the be all end all.  I came in hell bent on neuro and after a year realized that it was not for me.  I switched majors and still finished the pre-med track, but currently have no plans of applying to med school in the near future.  \n2. Name is not everything.  I hate to say it, but 18 year old me largely made this decision based on the fact that Hopkins was the best of the best in medicine and research and I thought that pedigree was everything.  Ultimately, no one cares where you went to school after you get your first job post-grad, and the name on your med school diploma will matter more than the one on your bachelors diploma, but either way an MD/DO is an MD/DO any way you slice it.\n\nTo address the social life piece, you will have to work harder at it than friends at other schools.  It is certainly possible, but this school definitely will not have the same abundance of things to do on the weekends.  Ultimately, I always valued a small group of friends over being in Greek life/going out 3 nights a week so this is ok.  I like the balance I've found.\n\nUltimately, with hindsight being 2020, I have had an incredible education here with great jobs, clinical experiences, and research opportunities here, but you can find that anywhere if you look hard enough.  If I could go back, I would follow the money because truthfully, I could have gotten a great education at my state school for a less than quarter of the price.  GW, UF, and JHU are all good schools.  Follow your gut.  As hard as it is to see from your vantage point, 4 years from now, you will be about to graduate and won't be able to imagine making any other choice.  My main advice: make the decision ASAP and get excited! College is what you make of it, so embrace whatever school you choose.",

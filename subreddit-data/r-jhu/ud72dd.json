    "postText": "I might get lots of downvotes on this since mainly students are here. I just don't think I get paid enough to be a TA (it's part of my degree requirement).\n\nI get emails from students from 8AM to midnight. At first I tried to reply them asap but then I just got so tired. Why am I supposed to be \"on-call\" for so long while making minimum wage (or even less?). Someone is gonna ask \"why do you do PhD if you care so much money\" blah blah... No PhD students would expect a high salary. We are okay with getting paid so little because we are trading it for research, gaining experience etc.\n\nTAing is like working for the university on our free time: less time to rest, less time to do research. And the school knows that PhD is not like any real job where we can just easily quit and go to another company so they milk on us. Also, I hate when school or professors were like \"we need to be considerate and understanding especially during this difficult time\". However, at the end of the day, the burden falls on us again. Who will be considerate and understanding to TAs lol. I honestly think I spent more time on the class than the instructor does. They just come to lectures 2-3 times a week that's it.",

You have office hours for a reason, make a point to have students come to those instead of answering questions via email which is so much slower. Take your time responding to emails or offload the questions to office hours unless there's something thats actually urgent - you are NOT on call. Don't let anyone make you feel like you should be (including yourself). \n\n\nSadly, the optimal strategy for being a TA is to do the minimal amount of work that won't get you in trouble.",

Turn off notifications from whatever teaching platform you\u2019re using. Use your golden, most energetic time for research and your trash (sleepy or procrastinating) time to reply to students.\n\nAlso I think JHU hires enough PhD students that many here will sympathize with you.",

If you are a PhD student, you are for sure getting ripped off, although getting ripped off may be unavoidable if your department is setting the rate for all of its TAs. That being said, as others have mentioned, you can set boundaries with your students, and also make sure you are not doing uncompensated work. If your instructor is leaving a big chunk of class management as your responsibility, then you can absolutely start scheduling your interactions with students to fit your schedule\u2014you definitely do not need to be \u201con call.\u201d",

            "comment": "You don't have to answer the e-mails right away.  Answering right away just encourages more e-mail. It's not really your job as a TA to be the private tutor of an undergrad. Here's a rule to follow:\n\nNever answer an e-mail less than 24 hours after it's sent.  If an e-mail is sent Monday during the day, answer it Tuesday night or Wednesday during the day.  If an e-mail is sent on a Friday, do not answer until Monday night or Tuesday during the day. If you forget about an e-mail, don't worry too much about it.  If it's important, the student will send you an additional e-mail.\n\nIf that doesn't work and they keep sending you tons of e-mails, only answer e-mails during office hours. Or just refuse to answer any e-mails about course material by e-mail and require the students to actually show up to office hours.  You're not required to be on call to answer e-mails 24/7 as a TA.\n\nThis allows you to answer a couple e-mails in a row, and also prevents people from bugging you with tons of questions. Usually they're asking things right before something is due. If your answer comes after the assignment is due, they won't bother you in the future.",

            "comment": "Lots of undergrads with good intentions commenting with basically the same message of \u201cjust don\u2019t do the work\u201d. Which labor-wise is the right message but when you\u2019re teaching actual students who need help and you care about how they\u2019re doing is impossible. At least for the sciences, the TA load here is definitely higher than comparable universities. Assuming that grad students work 40 hour weeks (we absolutely don\u2019t) and are compensated about 34K a year, it works out to about $17 an hour. This is on top of our research load which we apparently don\u2019t even get paid for. JHU can absolutely afford to at least compensate us better if they won\u2019t reduce the workload.\n\nOne thing I\u2019d like to comment on is Piazza. It\u2019s a good idea but ultimately falls on the head TA (full disclosure yes I was a head TA for a large course so this is a but of a personal whine). Profs will institute policies where an answer has to be given to all questions in a few hours. But who does that fall to? Do you gave a rotating schedule of \u201con-call\u201d TAs? Absolutely not. So in the end it falls on the head TA to actually answer all of the questions.\n\nI could go on about this for a while but anyway yes I share OPs frustration. The school literally sent us emails about how well it\u2019s investments did over the pandemic and most department TAs got raises far below inflation. OP if you\u2019re interested in helping, the only organization with any actual leverage is Teachers and Researchers United (TRU). They\u2019ve been trying to unionize for quite a long time but are having trouble connecting with certain places on campus.",

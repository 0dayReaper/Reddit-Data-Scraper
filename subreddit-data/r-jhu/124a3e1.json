    "postText": "Hi! I have been searching for public health jobs, specifically jobs in academic institutions so that I can take advantage of their tuition exemption, remission, and or reimbursement programs. I recently received an offer from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and I was wondering if folks on this subreddit have worked at the school as an employee. If so, I would love to hear about your experience working there, especially with your experience with the tuition exemption/reimbursement/remission programs. Was it easy to enroll in the class you were interested in, or did you find that there were a lot of hurdles to jump to try to enroll in your course? Did you often find yourself getting shut out of classes that you were interested in due to the high enrollment of the undergraduate or graduate population? Did the tuition assistance/remission program end up having a lot of strings attached (e.g. having to explain relevance to current role, finding out certain departments didn't open their classes to working professionals and or did not participate in the tuition remission program, having to be enrolled in a degree program, etc.)?\n\nAny input regarding this would be much appreciated. Thanks so much for reading and for all of your help!",

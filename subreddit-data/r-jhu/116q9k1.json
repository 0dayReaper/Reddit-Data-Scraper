I understand the security benefits but I've just been finding it a bit cumbersome to keep logging back in and out, having to input a number from authenticator, every time I check my email. Idk if I'm just not getting how to disable this or if everyone's experiencing the same thing.",

It\u2019s very annoying, so much so that if you\u2019re not careful or very tech savvy you can be easily phished especially when you are in a hurry. I understand doing it once in a while but this thing is ridiculous, it\u2019s asking me daily and logs me out automatically even after a few hours sometimes. If you wanna be technical if anyone actually cares the can clone your phone and Authenticator. It happens very often in crypto.",

If not, you'll be prompted for 2FA/MFA more often. You can also check your[IT risk profile](https://myit.jh.edu) to see if there are any issues that might be causing the 2FA prompt every time. As mentioned, using the native Outlook app may also result in fewer 2FA prompts. \n\nAccount take-overs and credential phishing are a huge security issue in a large (100,000+ accounts) complex organization, so authentication security is one of the only ways to effectively provide a secure environment.",

    "postText": "Kind of a rant or whatever you wanna call it. I\u2019m a CS/AMS junior graduating early and I haven\u2019t made any close friends these past three years. The only \u201cfriend\u201d I have is my roommate I made freshman year and even then he usually has other friends that he does stuff with and I always feel left out. Normally during the school year, after I finish classes I go to the library to study or go back to my dorm to lie in bed and browse Reddit. It\u2019s really lonely seeing everyone out and about doing stuff while I\u2019m stuck inside doing homework. I\u2019m not sure what I did wrong either.\n\nI have some social anxiety, so it\u2019s not easy for me to just get out there. My roommate used to try to get me involved in clubs and stuff he signed up for, but I kept on saying no or giving an excuse not to go. And whenever I find something I think would be fun with other people, I usually get too anxious to ask and end up doing it myself (like watching movies, getting dinner, etc.). Even when it comes to friends\u2019 or acquaintances\u2019 birthdays, I\u2019m too anxious to make a post or send a text wishing them a happy birthday. I tried to join new clubs last year before COVID hit, but since we went online I haven\u2019t been going to any meetings.\n\nAnyway what prompted me to write this was a conversation with my roommate. I brought these feelings up with him and our conversation just made me feel like shit. His response was that he  has been trying to get me involved, but that I never seemed to care or seemed interested and that I\u2019m never the one initiating conversations or inviting him to hangout or anything. That it\u2019s always him inviting me to stuff or starting conversations and that\u2019s it\u2019s exhausting always being the initiator. That he knows I don\u2019t have many friends and that he thinks I should\u2019ve tried harder if I really wanted to meet others. \n\nAnd I get that. I haven\u2019t put in as much effort as I probably could\u2019ve, but it\u2019s just a slap in the face to hear it from someone else. Since COVID, I\u2019ve been at home the entire time just doing classes. The only person from Hopkins I talk to is my roommate and it\u2019s only about homework or classes. I just feel really depressed that I\u2019m ending my time at Hopkins with no connections.\n\nIf you\u2019re still at Hopkins, please make an effort to meet people. I know it\u2019s difficult, but if I could do things over again I would\u2019ve gone to clubs I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be interested in. I would\u2019ve asked my roommate to get dinner instead of hoping that he\u2019d ask me. I would\u2019ve tried to get over my crippling anxiety. Please don\u2019t end up like me.",

Can I recommend talking to the JHSAP? http://jhsap.org/ Your social anxiety is not going to go away once you graduate, and they might be able to help you develop techniques to feel better. You still have some time before graduation to take advantage of this resource. Sending you good, positive feelings. :)",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a grad student, and I had a bit of a similar experience in my undergrad. I want to second the advice of the other poster that social anxiety doesn\u2019t just go away. Sometimes I feel like I would be better at meeting people and making friends if only I wanted it more, but I do want it. I just get scared that they don\u2019t actually like me or want to hang out with me. Or I worry about being uncomfortable in a new situation with new people. So I don\u2019t talk to people or go out. These are all feelings that I am trying to work through in therapy because I really do want to make more friends. \n\nAll of that is to say that beating yourself up about not making friends at JHU is not productive and having social anxiety is not your fault. However, moving forward not only takes recognition that you are unhappy with your current lack of friendships but also putting in real work to overcome your anxiety.",

I know it's extra hard right now because of COVID, but I would recommend trying to join a few clubs.\n\nI've also heard people making friends through Bumble. They have a section of the app designed for making friends as opposed to relationships. Maybe you could give that a try.\n\nI would also recommend checking out JHSAP. Mental health can be a challenge, and it's important to get help whenever you can.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you. It's okay to be sad. It happens to the best of us. Everything will be okay in the end. I promise.",

I find that when you absolutely have to talk to others to get things done, talking to other people gets easier.\n\nIf you join a CS related club (which you can probably find through Campus Groups or Hopkins Groups) with a specific goal in mind, you\u2019ll be forced to connect with others and that exposure will decrease your social anxiety considerably.\n\nThe anxiety probably stems from not having to \u201cexercise\u201d that social muscle.  Also remember to take it at your own pace. It\u2019s ok to take a leap of faith, but if you go too far, you might end up in your shell again.  \n\nI think if you try to join a support group for social anxiety, connecting with others will help too, because you know that the people you\u2019re talking to are also dealing with similar issues, thus making it easier to connect.  \n\nIf you want to work together on this, I\u2019d be willing to try to help you find something.

I've heard clubs are a great way of doing this. I hope I can have some great social experiences, and especially that COVID will die off. \n\nMy situation is, I've always been fairly happy even without a pronounced social life. However I do feel it may be a growing concern for me, perhaps some underlying dissatisfaction that could become more prominent with time. A big concern for me is having friends in adult life, when I'm not surrounded by people my age. Although before that, as I said I hope to make some great connections, but not only that to actually do fun things with those people, in my time at JHU. I've made great friends so far, but actually going out and doing social things has been more of a challenge for me.\n\nSorry to be talking about myself so much. It's a difficult situation, but a nagging thought for me is the \"what could've been\" element of it. I won't lie it's a legitimate concern. But if it helps, please know you're not alone. Well hell who am I to talk, I have yet to start college anyway. I hope we can both work on this. \n\nI also think it might be like anything else in a sense; something that requires commitment and a willingness to fail before you succeed. This is cliche, I know, but really, as someone else said try exercising that \"social muscle\"; like any other it has to be challenged, maybe even to the point where you want to quit, as in a workout, many many times and then you'll find it much stronger.",

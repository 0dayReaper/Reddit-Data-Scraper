From what I understand, both of those classes are pretty similar and the primary difference is that the math is less rigorous in algos for bioinfo and the grading is a little more forgiving. The same textbook is used though and the same topics are essentially covered. \n\nAre you in the JHU bioinformatics discord?",

The textbook used is formally titled \u201cintroduction to algorithms\u201d by Cormen et al, but it\u2019s nickname is \u201cCLRS algorithms\u201d\n\nAbdul Bari\u2019s algorithms videos on YouTube is a great place to start. I also really appreciated the lectures from the MIT algorithms course on YouTube, particularly the semesters taught by Eric Demaine.",

I think Python is allowed now, but when I took it, the programming projects were all in Java and a lot of my classmates struggled. \n\nHow was data structures for you? Did you take it at JHU or elsewhere? In my opinion, the programming assignments were the *easiest* part of the course, but I had been programming for a few years by the time I took the class. There were only 3 programming assignments, most of the class is writing pseudocode or focused on theory.",

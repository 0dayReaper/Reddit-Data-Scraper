I'm a 5-minute walk from the bus stop near campus and paying 1,550 for a 2 bedroom with my partner -- water and heat included. 1 bedroom units/studios go at around 1000-1300 depending on the street you're on and if it's a basement unit. However, I find row homes the best bang for your buck in terms of space.",

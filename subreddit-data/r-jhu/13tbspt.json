For context, my high school bathrooms were terribly dirty so if the communal bathrooms are anything like that I wouldn't want to live there.",

I think it depends on the people there though, because I lived there 3 years ago and have heard some interesting stories about  stuff that happened in the years after me involving cleanliness.",

I am currently looking for a housing accomodation for a single room, and just want to make sure I did the process correctly, as I still haven't received an update regarding my request from SDS. I submitted the New Student Accommodation form around 2 weeks ago, and a week later, I submitted documentation from my physician on a portal. However, I haven't gotten a response yet- should I email SDS to check on my request?",

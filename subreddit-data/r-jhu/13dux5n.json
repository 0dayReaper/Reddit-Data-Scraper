    "postText": " Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a high school senior who has been accepted into both Johns Hopkins University and Carnegie Mellon University. I am now facing the difficult task of deciding between these two great institutions and thought it would be valuable to get some firsthand perspectives from current JHU students or alumni.\n\nMy primary academic interests lie in the intersection of physics (specifically quantum physics and subatomic physics) and **possibly** computer science (focusing on AI and quantum computing). I am also highly interested in entrepreneurship and am considering starting my own startup in the future. Furthermore, I've had the opportunity to conduct research in physics, which I found deeply rewarding and would like to continue at the university.\n\nHere's how I currently view the two universities:\n\n**JHU:** Known for its strong physics program and commitment to research, which could provide me with a deep understanding of quantum physics and opportunities for further research. Although not as recognized for its CS program as CMU, JHU does offer resources for budding entrepreneurs and has a growing innovation scene.\n\n**CMU:** Renowned for its computer science program and entrepreneurial culture. The university also has a Quantum Computing Group within its Physics Department, which could potentially align well with my interests.\n\nGiven these factors, I'm struggling to decide which institution would be the best fit for my interests and aspirations.\n\nIf anyone here has insights into the physics or CS programs at JHU, or has advice on balancing academic interests with entrepreneurial goals, I would greatly appreciate your input. Also, if anyone has experience with physics research at JHU, I would love to hear about it.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

That said, JHU won me over in the end due to its flexibility; they made it easiest to switch majors, fulfill distribution requirements, and explore new topics and classes, particularly across Arts &amp; Science and Engineering. The way CMU silos their majors internally was a negative to me. \n\nI didn\u2019t start as a physics major, but that is the degree I got in the end. Happy to talk about the physics program, though at this point I\u2019m sure you could get opinions from more recent students as well.",

Both are great schools but Hopkins is definitely in a higher tier for reputation and research (in all departments except CS). It's so flexible to change majors, double major, etc. at Hopkins and there's a great entrepreneurship minor. If cost of attendance isn't a factor, I think JHU is an easy choice here.",

Again, thank you for the info and much appreciated with the advice!",

I chose JHU over CMU and UPenn for my PhD for similar reasons, especially considering CMU is not well known outside of computer science.",

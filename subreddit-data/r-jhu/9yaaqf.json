Theres such a stark culture difference between economic classes that is inescapable even if you have a chance to leapfrog the system by going to an amazing university. Senior here and one of the hardest pills I learned to swallow was that much of the upper crust will never see me as nothing more than an opportunistic bottom feeder scraping by on a Billionaires hand out and I could never hope to even reliably fake being a part of that society, from my manners, to my clothes, right down to the crooked teeth I couldnt get braces for. I'm not even dirt poor either(as Dave Chappelle puts it, 'my parents worked enough that I could afford to be poor around white people'). \nThis being said, a chance to overcome struggle is always better than struggle alone. I have always been annoyed by how JHU boasts their diversity, despite the fact that most of the nonwhite students have the same amount of percieved entitlement and privilege as the white students, but this is a great step.",

An environment where everyone has the same amount of privilege is not diverse if there other kinds of people existing with different amounts of privilege. What im talking about is the difference between when a friend says 'I'm poor' and when I say it. For them it really means that they have money and can survive but are limited by the allowance they get from their parents. In a way, I guess this is poor but it's not the 'I'm poor' I'm used to. Would you argue Hopkins is a truly diverse environment?",

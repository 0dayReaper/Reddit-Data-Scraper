It also gives you a bit of flexibility in applying to jobs outside of the traditional bme sphere. Doing a secondary of a BS in EE is a little bit more involved especially with BME having so much adjustment in their curriculum the past few years, but is doable. Alternatively,  if you plan classes out well and do a secondary of a BA in EE, I think it\u2019s only one or two extra classes if you take all your focus area bme classes in the ECE department. The main different between the two paths is in the lower level classes you take and whether you satisfy both departments freshman/sophomore requirements or just BMEs (which people traditionally do as their primary bc of how admission works) \nThere\u2019s often 2-3 BME/EE doubles each year. I would recommend reaching out to a student a year or two ahead of you (the undergraduate coordinators can help you find other students if needed) and asking them to share their schedule with you. It should be a solid foundation for when to take which courses and the feedback is really helpful. \nGood luck !!",

            "comment": "Hey just as a word of advice/ anecdote:\n\nI was able to get 6 months of consistent counseling from a therapist and medication from a psychiatrist through the counseling center, so I wouldn\u2019t write it off just yet.\n\nThe name of the game is persistence tbh.\n\nYou\u2019ve gotta start by selecting the right counselor (which you can pick from a variety if races and genders) and you\u2019ve got to schedule a new appointment w/ your counselor at the end of every appointment for the next week (or week after next).\n\nIk its a difficult process, but you CAN work the system.\n\nI think a lot of the problem comes from people wanting quick-fix ish solutions (ie: im struggling NOW, let me talk to someone so that problem can go away NOW). \n\nhealing really does take time and you have to commit to it if you really want to get anywhere. (speaking as a psych major and happy-ish recipient of counseling-center care)",

The main issue I have (if you read my other comments in this thread, you'll see I'm mostly just playing the audience via memes) is the intake procedure. You have to call, leave a message, wait on a response from an unlisted number (which most of the time will get auto screened or not answered because half of all phone calls are scams at this point) and fill out forms before you can even start the triage process, rather than being able to schedule something right away in a phone call or in an online portal. \n\nIt seems like the center mostly just acts as that triage center to get stopgap counseling for people who need it on a short term basis and to turf people to other care centers for long term care, which I admit is likely the best thing they can do with the resources and space/staffing they have available. \n\nI realize this meme may feed an overly negative narrative on that front, but I think the conversations I'm having in the comments are actually helpful as a resource for undergrads with those kinds of expectations of instant help to refer to, so I'm leaving it up.",

They've done fine with me, though the bureaucratic hoops are a bit onerous, and in all reality they're mostly just there to turf us off to dedicated service providers for us to be established as patients there, which is what they did with me.",

I did notice the overall feel here that they're not much liked, and I think that's a bit sad. You also say that they turfed you off -- what would you have preferred? \nI'm not very familiar with their services but they are the first PoC in many ways, so I feel like it would be great if their services were helpful.",

They do what they can with what they've got for the number of people they have. I'd like to see them deepen their functions since fewer people are using them now due to them not being able to do much for people out of state, but you take what you can get, and we're getting a decent amount from them.",

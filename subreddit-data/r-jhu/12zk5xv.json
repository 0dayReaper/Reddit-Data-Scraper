    "postText": "Hello, I just was wondering if there were any lower GPA ORM students (3.5-3.7) who got into New York or California medical schools. I have a 3.5 as a junior and was wondering if I should give up on medical school haha. If you did have a poorer GPA and got into a medical school in one of the two states, could we chat about what you did to improve your application?",

Worked my ass off, used many books and videos as reference(I didn\u2019t remember much math, so had to relearn during the sem) I would suggest focus on lecture notes and textbooks, write own notes which makes huge difference specifically derivations in math, read as much as possible and practice to understand from different points of view, I got &gt;80% I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best but I\u2019m happy with it considering how weak I was before starting in math.",

Ask your TAs for their recommendation!",

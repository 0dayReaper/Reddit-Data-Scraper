    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI just recently got accepted into the MSN nursing program. I do have a few questions to anyone in Nursing or to the general population within the JHU community. \n\nThis question is for my fellow nursing students. If any of you did work-study? How was it? I\u2019m planning on applying for jobs that are really low maintenance so that I can focus academically on my studies because I really can\u2019t afford tuition. If you guys also participated in any clubs please provide me some pro tips about how you guys manage your schedule. \n\nFor my fellow peers what apartments did you guys find/ websites near campus? How is it walking to campus from your apartments? Is public transportation reliable? \n\nAny advice would help!!!!",

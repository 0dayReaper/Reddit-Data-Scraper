Any time there is a big drop in revenue at an institution, there are going to have to be cuts to offset those drops.  Depending on how bad things get at some places over the next 6 to 12 months, I wouldn't be surprised to see some universities fire tenured professors.",

Yes, it is age discrimination. \n\nAnd really, let's be honest, universities are more likely to replace a TT retire with a couple of adjuncts, so mandatory retirement wouldnt even help. Maybe COVID will finally force some necessary changes for the better on higher ed (lolyeahright)",

Yes, the older profs do take up resources that could go to the younger profs, but a number of older profs are also running really successful labs or contribute to the departments through teaching.  So to do some type of mandatory retirement age beyond being discriminatory would also be counterproductive-at the very least it would hurt recruitment of faculty.\n\nIt may be a strange concept, because they are technically employees, but in many ways the profs are what make the university.  The older ones who have been there for decades have brought in millions of dollars in grants to the university over the years (a large percentage of which goes to overhead), so if they want to stick around, I think they have earned that right.",

This is hardly unprecedented and should have been planned for.\n\nThe function of endowments nowadays is so antithetical to their purpose. Management firms take a substantial cut of the profits and are guaranteed a management fee - even when the funds lose money. What kind of incentive system is that?! Their best strategy to maximize their own gains is to put the money in high risk assets, leaving the university exposed to drops in the market. Plus their performance is more often than not equivalent or even worse than index funds.\n\nYale has an endowment 4x the size of Hopkins and it's announced the same austerity measures. Unbelievable.\n\nThe reason Hopkins can rake in the donations and federal grants is because of their name, and that name is built on the quality of research done at their institution. Yet when the going gets tough, the people who produce that world-class research get screwed by those who profit from it. So short-sighted.",

            "comment": "No, this is a terrible article.  Well mostly anyway.  Where to start?  I'll pick just one thing: JHU should have \"set aside\" something for this. \n\nHilarious. The amount needed would have been absolutely massive -- and yet it is very very difficult to build _any_ significant cash reserves at a university.  If you are a public then cash reserves are funds that could have been used to provide care for children, families, the sick, the poor, and so on.  But those people, families and children in serious circumstances, never received that needed care, because the university just sat on the funds. Hard to justify this. So, adequate liquidity? Not going to happen, and shouldn't, at least at the level needed -- where it would be a moral obscenity.  (And I suspect he is probably unaware that states periodically discover and confiscate the funds universities set aside).  The situation is similar for privates: that is, money that could have gone to scholarships, raises, initiatives, and so on, and instead it is doing not working at all or must making a few %s, and those things, very important things, that it could be used for aren't happening.  And, no, the endowment is not a bank account (sheesh). \n\nIn general universities still do pretty well, comparatively, in responding to challenges.  But they could never have been fully prepared for this one, at least not by financial actions.  \n\nThis was always going to be devastating for any university, and especially to universities with a large hospital complex (it is not just the JHU hospital that has lost patients and revenue; quite a number of hospitals throughout the US are in trouble because of a covid related steep drop in visits and patients).  \n\nAnd it doesn't matter if you are Holy Cross or Miami Dade, you are still in big trouble -- even though neither of those fit his caricature of \"corporatized\" JHU.   Or maybe they do; I don't know.",

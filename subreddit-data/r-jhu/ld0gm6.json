The party was literally hosted by Wawa, a majority of the attendees were athletes. This past sem, a lot of the sports teams still held/went to big parties (I.e. lax and football), large enough for cops to be called on them. They\u2019ve been mainly protected by athletics (being benched during a season that isn\u2019t really happening is NOT a punishment). There\u2019s a reason why student athletes were called out by the university specifically to quarantine for a week and to get tested everyday. It\u2019s about time that they finally face real consequences for actions that endanger our community.",

When it\u2019s bad enough that the UNIVERSITY singles out student athletes, you know it\u2019s a more systemic problem/more about the culture/type of people on some of these sports teams. How many football players knew about the party and didn\u2019t say anything, even if they didn\u2019t go? How many field hockey, soccer players? I know that there are many athletes that are following the rules. But it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that many of the sports teams keep holding 30+ people parties, and until now they haven\u2019t received real consequences for them because they\u2019d been protected by the athletics department. \n\nIt\u2019s like calling the freshmen out for partying. No, not every freshman parties/breaks covid guidelines. But a higher proportion of them do when compared to the rest of the student population (yet they don\u2019t get offended when people blame the freshmen).",

If you need to take your mask off for one second to adjust it then you can do it and no one will attack you. But going to a party isn't an accident... a lot of what people are on the look out for and willing to report aren't accidents. It's crucial that we as students monitor each other because the admin and staff aren't able to be everywhere and monitor us so closely.

There is no biological need to be trapped in a dingy basement with sticky ass floors on a Friday night. Nothing against people who want to do that, but the world doesn't revolve around your \"needs\" when a global pandemic is still raging. Is it that hard to get shitfaced with only a few people you know instead of half of campus?\n\n\"The impacts on student culture and trust within the student body is also completely shot\"\n\nIf that's the case then shit man guess we should all double down on Hopkins' reputation and become super cutthroat.\n\nIt's literally not that hard to just not party. There are so many ways to meet people in person and have a good time *and still follow the restrictions*.

It's optional because some people aren't comfortable even with the marginally increased risk.\n\nAgain, hundreds of universities around the country have demonstrated how you can bring students back to campus and limit COVID transmission.

I\u2019m sure it will be fine after this incident - no one wants to be the idiot who causes the next problem for the entire school. Forcing students to stay at home and study online is probably horrible for mental health so I appreciate that they are making an effort to have students on campus.",

However, I think it is important that we act gracefully when judging those who do it. There is a clear link between authoritarian ideology and disease prevalence in society. I am not an advocate of no regulation and no consequences. However, I am an advocate for maintaining attitude of reasonable mercy when judging individuals. If not, one risks allowing the collective to become ruled by fear and, ultimately, give in to the safety net that authoritarianism provides. \n\nObviously, you may say, this is a very dramatic argument. To the contrary, I would say, it is at the individual level that ideologies and actions become widely adopted and so one must keep in mind what the consequences of their thoughts and actions would  be if applied to the society at large.",

I've heard that the 3 guys who went despite knowing they were positive are being expelled, as they should be.\n\nYour entire argument boils down to 'don't judge them harshly because it could cause more rebellious incidents' Its the same shit Republicans are spewing now about wanting unity &amp; not partisan politics. It's too late for that, actions have consequences. Don't try to weasel out of the consequences after the fact.",

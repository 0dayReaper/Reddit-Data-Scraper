You can probably get a studio or basement apartment for 900, just check Zillow. Live on or near the JHMI route if you don't have a car. Securing a flat in Charles Village can be challenging especially during the Fall. Consider expanding your search to Mt. Vernon, the JHMI bus stop is at the literal center of the neighborhood and would get you right in front of the Homewood campus. They're mostly on time and come in every 15 minutes or so.",

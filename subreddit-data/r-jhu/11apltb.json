    "postText": "For anybody in the JHU Whiting School's EP program and studying for the MS in Artificial Intelligence, how has your experience with the program been? How do you like the classes and how would you rate the overall rigor, depth, and structure of the curriculum/courses? How have the professors treated you? Have any of you had good experiences using the online career services or career counseling? Are there any research opportunities for MS students? \n\nI understand the program is fairly new, so I haven't had much luck finding reviews from students who are actually in (or have graduated from) the program. I'm considering enrolling and hoping to get some more insight on what to expect and how to make the most of the program.",

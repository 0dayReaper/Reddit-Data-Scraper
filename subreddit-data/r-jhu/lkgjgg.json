You were very kind and helpful towards clueless strangers from across the seas, especially during these tough Covid19 times.\n\nStay safe and stay healthy.\n\nThanks once again and I am happy that my kid choose Hopkins.\n\nBTW: If any parent of  '25 international prospective student is reading this and has those typical international parent queries, pm me please, I will be happy to share my experiences/guidance.",

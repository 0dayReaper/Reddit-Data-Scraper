    "postText": "Incoming BMB Biochemistry and Molecular Biology student here. I wonder how possible it would be for a student to transfer from MHS to the ScM program at the School of Public health after being admitted. Also, will the coverage be working after the transfer? I think there's no scholarship to MHS so far and I really want some insights from alumni here. Thank you!",

It's a fairly straightforward process and most students I know I were able to make the jump. \n\nAnd also yes, as a previous commenter said, there's a big tuition decrease between the MHS program and ScM",

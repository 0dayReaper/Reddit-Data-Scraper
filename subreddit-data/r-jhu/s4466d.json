How am I gonna breath wearing them 6-8 hrs a day, let alone working out, cardio or doing any activity... also masks cost money, especially the N95/KN95. Is the university able to supply everyone even one mask a day, or the majority is gonna come out of our own pocket...\n\n(I know medical personnel have been doing this for years, props to them) I am kind of tired of JHU admin trying to create a literal bubble. At this point, just switch to all virtual if they actually want to stop infection in the JHU but they don't dare either. (just my opinion and you can totally disagree with me) Stay healthy guys.",

Also all the masks I've found on Amazon are very suspicious if not blatantly fake \ud83d\ude2d. Where am I supposed to get N95s that won't cost me an arm and a leg!? \n\nFurthermore, students are the ONLY people who have to get tested (varies from campus to campus). I totally get  and approve making us wear masks and even mandating the boost. I even understand why they are now making thousands of students eat outside in the middle of winter. I can't say I approve of the last bit but I get it. But the whole double mask thing is ridiculous. Wasn't the cdc saying we weren't supposed to do that? I'm not sure if the cdc has changed their policy on that... (let me know if they did please). \n\nJHU covid policies almost seem like it's more PR than anything else rn. I moved here last semester and my anxiety about covid has been through the roof at Hopkins. I'm so worried about missing classes and assignments if I test postive  and have to go to the quarantine housing. I don't do jack squat socially because this college was to expensive and my education is too important to me to miss. UGH sorry about the rant it's just so FRUSTRATING.",

So, the admin is hedging their risks with these draconian new covid policies which are logistically impractical.\n\nI, personally, am okay with it all except the fact that if you worked out regularly (and even if you didn't), you'd at least need a new surgical mask everyday.",

It's now all policy over science I feel like.

Leaving the hybrid system aside (and this will happen as soon as the Uni is hit by its first cluster), strict lockdowns are not exactly a solution when a disease is entering an endemic stage unless we are going over our healthcare capacity. \n\nLet's not look up to Asian countries (namely China in this case, since its the only one having strict lockdowns now) for their lockdown management - the human cost has been huge given the absolute powers held by a few megalomaniacs over others. \n\nThe school and the govt. have never put health first. Their objective is the smooth functioning of the school and the country/state. Everything else is secondary to them, including our health (and theirs for that matter). \n\nI'm surprised that more people didn't expect something like this covid policy from the admins. They aren't exactly the imaginative kind. Frankly, I'm curious as to how this will pan out. Enforcing double masking is going to be pretty impossible - however this will certainly force a large proportion of student population to use N95 masks (and versions) which would drive down infection rate to an extent, albeit temporarily. I believe the admin is hoping to somehow limp over to March/April without any major spread/cluster and the virus trends down in the US (then, they'll probably go back to single masking policy). Pretty risky strategy though.",

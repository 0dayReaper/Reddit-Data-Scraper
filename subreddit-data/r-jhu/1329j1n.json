    "postText": "I lived at Homewood campus so I am not familiar with The Severn or how it is but after graduation I'm working full-time on Homewood campus and my roommate will be working at the medical campus. \n\nWe thought Mt Vernon would be a good middle ground but we both aren't familiar with it's reputation and the leasing office told me today that the application is approved and I need to sign lease by this Sunday. I can't tour it because the office closed, but I have seen videos of the unit.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback or thoughts on The Severn!",

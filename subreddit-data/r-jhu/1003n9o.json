Is transferring to BME internally difficult and is it worth the supposed decrease in admissions selectivity of not applying to BME directly?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Contrary to what the other commenters are saying, it is possible to transfer into BME (I know someone who did). However, the opportunity to do so is far from guaranteed and only arises very rarely. The best way to become a BME major at JHU is to apply and be accepted as one.\n\nThat being said, I was a BME major during undergrad, and the program is not that great. In principle, I believe any undergrad BME curriculum is going to be too spread out, making it so that students learn about many subject areas but not much about any particular area. I\u2019m currently a PhD candidate studying biophysics, and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that I learned more biology TAing an introductory freshman biology class during my PhD than I did during my entire time at Hopkins. On top of that, while I was there, JHU BME was incredibly disorganized, with classes and requirements constantly being changed. At one point, a half-semester course in data science was added to the curriculum (and, to my knowledge, we were not informed of this change until shortly before we had to take the course). This class had a lab component that involved lots of coding in Python; however, nothing was done to ensure that students knew how to code in Python going into the class. All of the coding done previously in other BME classes was pretty limited and in MATLAB, and while a programming class was a graduation requirement, there were no rules stating when the class had to be taken or what language you learned in the class. Most students, especially more biologically-inclined students, struggled heavily with that course, and every lab section and office hour was a complete disaster. I\u2019m not sure if things have smoothed out, but if they haven\u2019t, you can expect a very rocky undergraduate. \n\nIf you actually want to learn biomedical engineering, double major in biology and whatever area of engineering you find interesting. JHU BME is just a feeder major for med school anyways.",

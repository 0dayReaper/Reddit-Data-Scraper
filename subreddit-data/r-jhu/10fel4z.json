Honestly the professor isnt great at teaching but youll pass as long as you put basic effort into it. I stopped watching the lectures after a few weeks and just googled stuff for the hws and got a B- which i was happy with.",

Yes, the homework and exams are \u201ca lot of coding.\u201d That\u2019s the entire point. If you just want to put python and sql on your CV, maybe take a couple of udemy courses instead.",

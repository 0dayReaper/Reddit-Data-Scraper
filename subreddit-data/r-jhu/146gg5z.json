    "postText": "I am currently in a process of recruiting new members for a non profit at Hopkins. \n\nIt will mainly be working with underserved populations and using community-based digital health to educate them about cardiovascular health (vaping, e-cigarettes, etc) through creating educational videos and one-day teaching classes held at local middle/high schools and shelters for the homeless population. I am planning to collaborate/partner with cardiologists at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, who I personally know through my research lab. \n\nPlease PM me or comment below if interested!",

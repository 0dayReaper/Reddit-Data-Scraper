I was like, \"great this is an awesome class and I'll get an A!\" Well the tests require an annoying amount of memorization (like, any small thing in the lectures could show up as a specific question).\n\nOtherwise, it's a really cool class though, and Grayson is an excellent lecturer. I'm genuinely a lot more interested in the field. Just, the tests kinda hurt me in the GPA more than I expected",

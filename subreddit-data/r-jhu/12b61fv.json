Are there any downsides on deferring and joining in the Spring semester in terms of the experience while studying or getting a job after graduation?",

When I was considering it briefly iirc it said that you can only defer on a yearlong basis. I could be wrong.\n\noverall, I wouldn\u2019t suggest it as you can always work for that company in a diminished role or find another opportunity, and the sooner you get your degree the more options you\u2019ll have in the long term, though if you really want to stay, one year in the grand scheme of things rlly isn\u2019t too important so you wouldn\u2019t be missing out on too much either way.",

Also fall 24 felt kinda late for me cause I finished my undergrad in 22 and I'm already getting used to the work life so it's going to be difficult to go back to studying. The exposure at the company I'm currently working at seems to be good and I thought that joining in Jan instead of Aug/Sept wouldn't be much of a gap and I'd be better prepared for my study if I go a couple of months later. The part about feeling a little behind and having difficulty in making friends makes sense tho.",

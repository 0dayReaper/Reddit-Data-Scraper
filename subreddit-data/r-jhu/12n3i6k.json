    "postText": "I was recently admitted into the MS EHE program for Fall 2023! (I\u2019m a domestic student from Massachusetts). Is anyone here also a part of the program or familiar with it? \n\nI have not heard anything about financial aid yet, and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s truly worth it to go into debt to pursue this degree. I have a Bachelor of Arts in German so an engineering degree is needed to change career fields, but I\u2019m honestly having second thoughts about JHU and whether I\u2019d be better off going elsewhere.",

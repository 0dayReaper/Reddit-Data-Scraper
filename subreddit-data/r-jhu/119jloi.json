    "postText": "\nOk so I Ed 2ed to hopkins and got in (yay\ud83d\ude01). But I didn\u2019t get into BME, so they\u2019re letting me pick a new major. I kind of see it as a blessing in disguise because I know I need to get a part time job to pay for school and I think BME may have been too difficult to pull off getting a good GPA for med school AND working at the same time. Now I\u2019m wondering 1) what\u2019s the best pre-med track major at hopkins that would allow for extra time to work 2) will it hinder my med school acceptance to pick said easier major? I\u2019m pretty interested in all the other pre-med related majors at hopkins (bio/neuroscience/public health especially) so dedication wouldn\u2019t really be an issue. Any help is appreciated \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\n\n(first Reddit post ever so if I\u2019m doing something wrong or forgetting something my bad idk how this platform works\ud83d\ude2d)",

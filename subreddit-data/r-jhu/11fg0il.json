            "comment": "Okay UH SO this might sound disheartening but I\u2019m kinda going to have to assume that there\u2019s some grade inflation at your school. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is necessarily a death sentence BUT pls be aware that the CS department is not going to be kind on grades. I truly don\u2019t think the SAT is really a good test but a 960 does kinda show some deficiencies in studying. \n\nIf you do choose to enroll in Hopkins, it\u2019s going to be tough. I came from a shitty public school with tons of grade inflation (like 30 valedictorians) but I was able to squeak by as a premed with a 3.9 so far (only 1 semester in though). I did a cs class (gateway java) and linear algebra, and I ended up surviving. But one thing that I observed is that people who got in from really grade inflated shitty public high schools can have a harder time. I knew ppl from grade inflated high schools who failed the first cs class (and are about to fail another one) because they weren\u2019t used to the rigor.\n\nIt\u2019s gonna be tough, but it\u2019s not impossible. Even with terrible preparation, I came to Hopkins and had to put in a ton of effort to catch up to everyone else. Really carefully weigh your options before coming to Hopkins, and if you do, welcome fellow blue Jay! But be aware that it might be a rough first year and you might get grades that you will be shocked at. I was shocked when I saw a D in linear algebra, and it was a wake up call for me to ditch high school habits and get serious. Ended up with an A- in linear algebra and As in all other classes so anything\u2019s possible.",

            "comment": "You're probably very smart, but the CS curriculum here loves a good exam that even exceptionally good test-takers struggle in. It's better to be a good student at an average school than borderline failing at a top university. If you got into JHU, then you clearly have something going for you. If you end up joining JHU, you risk sacrificing that to focus completely on academics, which may not be your strength. I would reconsider.",

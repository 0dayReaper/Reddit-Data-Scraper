    "postText": "Hi! My roomates and I are currently on the waitlist for University West apartments right now. We were told that there are around 5 four-person rooms that were potentially moving out, and that they would take us off the list as spots opened up, but we recently called and there doesn't seem to be any progress or confirmation on whats going on, so we are thinking of giving up and applying for some other apartments as well.\n\nAnybody have any experience/advice/or know someone that is moving out that would be willing to give us a heads up? Thanks!",

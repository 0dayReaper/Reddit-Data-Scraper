However, I also think the proposed solution is very dumb. I think the best thing to do would\u2019ve been to use that week for instruction and end the semester a week early. Would it remove the break that students usually have to destress? Yes. But I think it\u2019s the better compromise compared to breaking up the break into 5 separate days over the spring semester. You get an extra week of summer break and it complies with COVID spread concerns. That\u2019s just my solution though, I\u2019m sure someone could come up with a better one.",

Surprising no one, people went on vacation, and probably got a lot of people sick. Was that specifically a Hopkins problem? No, probably not, but I\u2019m sure some Hopkins students did.\n\nSo this year, rather than risk that again, and because they wanted to still give students a break from classes, they decided to give the same number of days and chop it up into different weeks.\n\nIt makes sense. Doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t suck, I agree, but don\u2019t act like they\u2019re doing it out of spite or punishment. It\u2019s a preventative measure to protect everyone from exposure, either abroad or at Hopkins.",

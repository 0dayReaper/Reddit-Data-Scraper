    "postText": "Hello All, I'm an incoming freshman for the Fall 2023 semester at JHU  on the premed track but I have some questions and dilemmas for what courses I should be taking.\n\n1. I received a 4 on my AP Chem Exam and have the opportunity to take App Chem with Bragg for 1 semester or take Gen Chem I and II with labs for 2 semesters. I'm not sure which to choose because tbh I have very minimal memory of chemistry, although apparently there's a Chemistry ALEKS we can use to review in the summer? Mostly I'm just concerned about Bragg, is he a good teacher, does he grade harshly, are his tests unreasonable? I would really appreciate some feedback on what I should do and if Mr. Bragg is worth it or I should just take Gen Chem I/II.\n2. If I do take App Chem, is Falzone still an Orgo teacher during the spring semester for freshman? I've heard a lot of good stuff about him but not sure if he only teaches Orgo in the fall and I'd be stuck with a worse professor.\n3. I was also wondering whether I should take Gen Bio I? I know it is not required for my major but do you guys recommend it for premed as a refresher? Btw I got a 5 on the AP Bio test and always found it pretty easy.\n4. Also do you guys recommend taking the FYS for Microbe Hunting or Phage Hunting? They both seem super interesting but I can't decide between them.  I've also heard Tuberculosis is good. Which class would be the most fun and allow me the most experience in lab techniques? I'm very interested in gaining experience in a lab setting / research environment. \n\nThank you for the help",

            "comment": "Congrats on coming to Hopkins! I'm mol/cell too and have completed all the classes you mentioned:\n\n1. I got a 4 right before my first semester and Applied chem humbled me \u2013 I managed to get by from reading the textbook and studying w friends but I felt my AP knowledge helped for 1/2 the stuff we learned (quantum mechanics was unit 2 and harddd). The biggest pro from taking it was not having to worry about gen chem II + lab (had more space in my spring schedule) and meeting friends thru collective struggle\n2. Falzone teaches Orgo I fall and II spring, some sections are reserved for freshmen for both semesters iirc\n3. Gen Bio I was a rly fun and helpful bio refresher for later mol/cell core classes, especially since I had taken AP Bio two years since. Highly recommend Roberson \u2013 he's a great professor. Just know your first core class is genetics in spring so if you feel confident in your bio knowledge, you could put another class in place of Gen Bio\n4. I took Tuberculosis fall as my FYS and both Microbe Hunters and Phage Hunters the following spring (before they became FYS). Both Phage &amp; Microbe Hunters represent two major solutions to the antibiotic resistance crisis: they're both project-oriented classes that teach you microbiology lab techniques. Tuberculosis is taught by Dr. Horner (cell bio lab instructor) and is more seminar-style (read/discuss scientific articles &amp; present an article as your final assignment). If I had to go back and only choose one, I'd 100% go with Microbe Hunters: Dr. Broderick is an amazing professor and your weekly lab work is more diverse/interesting than Phage hunters\n5. Someone mentioned PEBL (protein engineering biochemistry lab) \u2013 I took that my freshman fall and it was hard but also had meaningful lab work. Essentially you and your lab teammates work together to express/isolate a model protein (SNase) with a novel mutation and then run experiments to see how the mutation affects the protein's properties. It's def writing intensive (don't expect a good grade on your first essay) but it's possible to do well (highly recommend TA/instructor office hours). I notice more freshmen are taking it so you likely would find other ppl your year",

It was a lot of work, my friends and I thought the exams were fairly difficult. Bragg was okay but personally he didn't make much of a difference either way. He was there? Lol. All said and done though, I'm still glad I took it and got it done in one semester rather than sitting through intro chem for two.",

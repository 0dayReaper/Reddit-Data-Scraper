I\u2019ve come across some commercially owned properties and considering the Baltimorean as one option, but I know hearing from current residents would be a huge help in finding new options / narrowing down and eliminating others. just b/c an apartment building is shiny and new doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a nice place to live",

I lived there for a semester because it was the only affordable furnished short-term apartment I could find last minute. It's old and the elevator is a little sketchy, and I saw the occasional cockroach, but management is fine and it was good enough. The walk to campus was a little farther than I expected but I got used to it. \n\nCheck out [this document](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/community-living/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/10/Homewood-Area-Commercial-Properties.pdf) if you haven't.",

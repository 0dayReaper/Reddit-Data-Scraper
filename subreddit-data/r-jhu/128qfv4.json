    "postText": "Hi guys, hope you are doing well!\n\nI have just received the offer letter from these two, and it is so difficult to make the choice. I believe that in the CS field, UIUC should be stronger than JHU, so I like UIUC more. However, my advisor says that this gap is small, while JHU has a much higher general ranking and more resources per capita.\n\nI hope to work in the industry to make money after my graduation. I realize that JHU's tuition should be higher, but that is not a big problem to me. I do care the resources I can get in the school, but I doubt that because UIUC's CS seems much stronger. Besides, I am from China and I hope to stay in US, so OPT will matter, if it makes any difference.\n\nAny advise would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "First of all, congratulations on receiving offers from both universities!\n\nAs a graduate from UIUC and current faculty at JHU, I can certainly give my perspectives. Both are fantastic places to pursue studies and regardless which you choose, you will have an excellent education.\n\nLuckily for you, a degree from either holds significant weight if you are pursuing an industry position. The one major difference is if there is a specific field you with to follow. JHU has many unique opportunities especially in the field of machine learning or bioengineering. UIUC has access to many strengths in supercomputing. \n\nYou should also consider the location (UIUC is in the middle of the cornfields, and JHU is nested in the center of Baltimore). \n\nBest of luck with your decision!",

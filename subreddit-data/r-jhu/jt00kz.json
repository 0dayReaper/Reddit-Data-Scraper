This entire class is a mess and it just keeps getting messier everyday, but the group chat was one of the few reasons I haven\u2019t failed the class yet.\n\nOn an unrelated note, what the fuck is Wierman thinking with all this bs?",

I want to firstly say I am pretty saddened by this situation and the current state of the course. I genuinely enjoy assisting y\u2019all and it sucks how this class is being run. I truly feel that I didn\u2019t cross that boundary. It just sucks much more of that feeling that I wanted to help and bring people together, but it seems that can not occur anymore. I am truly hoping nothing goes past tomorrow. On a human level, I appreciate all of the support that I am receiving from everyone in/out of this class; it means a ton to me during this time. I hope everyone who sees this, and especially to those in this class with me, can have a good end to their semester, and I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all posted on what happens.\n\nThanks again to everyone who has made this first semester at JHU one to remember :) Just remember there\u2019s 4 weeks (3 with break) left",

But if they try to give you any further punishment like a failing course grade or something that seems undeserved/will affect you seriously and/or go on your record you should consider taking it to the academic ethics board for review.",

Owner of the chat deleted it after everyone left. Small dick energy if you ask me. The only person that can teach an ounce of understandable content gets in trouble. Professor and class are garbage. These sessions were in response to the Prof telling TA's to stop helping the students so much.",

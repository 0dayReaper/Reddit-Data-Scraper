It is in a 4B2B and all of my roommates will be subletting their rooms as well (mixed gender). You will have access to all 9E amenities, including the terrace, study rooms, gym, etc. My lease will be ending July 31, so unfortunately the room is not available in August. \n\n\nI am also subleasing my furnished room in a Wyman Towers 2B2B for the months of July and August. You will get your own private bathroom, and there is laundry in the building.\n\nIf someone would like to sublease for June-August, they are welcome to move to the wyman towers room for the month of August.\n\n9E rent (including utilities and wifi) - $1247 **negotiable**\nWyman Towers rent (including utilities and wifi) - $950 \n\nPlease dm if interested in either or both rooms for more details!",

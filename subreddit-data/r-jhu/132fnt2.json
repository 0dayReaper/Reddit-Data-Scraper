I\u2019m an incoming freshman (going to put down my deposit tonight!) and I was wondering if anyone knows what design teams, competition teams, or project clubs there are for engineering. I\u2019m planning on doing electrical engineering, so something in that field would be great (nothing biomedical please). Any information would be super helpful!",

I don\u2019t know if LINDT still exists, but that was terrible, and so are the \u201cAdvanced ECE Team Project\u201d classes. \n\nThe better option is to join an engineering club or do research. Given the small population of EEs on campus, we don\u2019t have many clubs that cater to hardware design, but some to check out would be rocketry, Baja, and robotics club. Research can get you into a lot more of the \u201chardcore\u201d low-level EE stuff",

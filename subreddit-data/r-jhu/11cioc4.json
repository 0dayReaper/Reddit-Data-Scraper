Honestly, I would just message your sophomore RA and say you\u2019re thinking of applying and wanted to pick their brain and that way you can get some tips on how hard it is to get accepted and what to emphasize in your app! \n\nI do know they usually list some alternates so they don\u2019t take everybody, unfortunately.",

            "comment": "Depends on how reliable that ~30 min commute estimate is and how much buffer time you have before your first class. If you'd be traveling during morning rush hour that could become 45-60 min if there is any type of traffic issue. You'll probably want to park in the South Garage or San Martin Garage, each about $100/mo or $8/day.",

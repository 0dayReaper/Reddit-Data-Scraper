He makes the students write the exams and then pits the students against each other by giving the students with 5 hardest questions bonus points and if you write a shit question he takes away 10 regular point. He did the prisoner dilemma on the students regarding the final and didn't disclose that this little experiment was going to happen. There's no way to properly study for tests bc you simply don't know what will be on it. Final is optional and the class wasn't hard but it was freaking hell. Avoid this class if you can.\n\nGrade received: B+",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, my roommate and I are looking to sublet our two bedrooms in Nine East (which are part of a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit) from May 29th - July 31, 2023! The other two rooms will be occupied by female Hopkins students.\n\nOur apartment is furnished and has an in-unit washer/dryer. We have a nice view on the 10th floor, and the building has a gym, plenty of study spots, and 24/7 security.\n\nPlease message me if you are interested in one or both of the rooms!",

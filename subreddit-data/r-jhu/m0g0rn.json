    "postText": "Hello my peeps,\n\nI've been in the JHU system a long time as student, staff, and now faculty. Organizationally, shit has gone downhill in some areas but JHU's top leadership have more often than not made it right.\n\nWhether it's sexual harrassment/equal opportunity, admin negligence, shitty lawyers, disrespectful staff, or asshole professors, there is a way to get justice, but usually you need to contact directors and deans rather than middle management.\n\nBelow I have some links and tips.\n\n* Every school has an Institutional Grievance Officer or IGO who is in charge of grievous bullshit in general. Here is the list: [https://provost.jhu.edu/academic-grievance-contacts/](https://provost.jhu.edu/academic-grievance-contacts/)\n* Here is the JHU regulation and guide to the grievance process [https://policies.jhu.edu/?event=render&amp;categoryId=764&amp;policyId=32463&amp;fileId=policy\\_32463.pdf&amp;\\_=0.663264181636](https://policies.jhu.edu/?event=render&amp;categoryId=764&amp;policyId=32463&amp;fileId=policy_32463.pdf&amp;_=0.663264181636)\n* Here is a link for the JHU standards of conduct [https://policies.jhu.edu/?event=render&amp;mid=800&amp;pid=32130&amp;fid=027.pdf](https://policies.jhu.edu/?event=render&amp;mid=800&amp;pid=32130&amp;fid=027.pdf)(good to cite when you are reporting someone)\n* Deans. Always CC deans.\n* Human resources. **Always copy them because they are in charge of promotions and hiring**. The people who hire are called \"talent acquisitions\" and JHU talent acquisitions people will hire anyone with a pulse. Here is the link to all the HR leads [https://hr.jhu.edu/about-hr/hr-leadership-team/](https://hr.jhu.edu/about-hr/hr-leadership-team/)\n* For sexual harrassment/equal opportunity, here is the reporting form, though I do not recommend necessarily as these people are trained to cover JHU's asses, not protect you. Thus I'd recommend always emailing people, not filling out forms. [https://oie.jhu.edu/discrimination-and-harassment/](https://oie.jhu.edu/discrimination-and-harassment/)\n* Here is JHU's anonymous tipline for reporting breach of ethics 844-SPEAK2US\n* For issues of general compliance, this is the director: [jlinks1@jhu.edu](mailto:jlinks1@jhu.edu). If you don't know what compliance is, don't bother with this.\n\nIf you'd like to go even higher, you can contact the government here:\n\nMaryland Commission on Human Relations6 St. Paul Street, Suite 900, Baltimore, MD 21202410-767-8600; TTY: 410-333-1767\n\nU.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights,Wanamaker Building, Suite 515100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, PA 19107215-656-8541; TDD: 215-656-8604\n\nIf I had to give general tips, the rule of thumb with these things is\n\n1. no one gives a fuck, so if you want them to give a fuck you need them to fear for their jobs or image\n2. CC whoever controls your target's job.\n3. **don't come at them until you have documentation or evidence.**\n4. **This is about fairness and good conduct, so don't abuse this or be an asshole**.\n5. Also a caveat: this tactic is best for for issues of standards of conduct and legal. It will not work for grades because everybody is sick and tired of JHU gunners complaining about grades.",

I've seen several cases where things did not pan out.  \n\nIf this is an issue unique to hopkins, then perhaps you have a chance. If this is an issue about sexual violence common to large institutions, involving hopkins before any of the other ones isn't going to change much. Just the nature of the beast.",

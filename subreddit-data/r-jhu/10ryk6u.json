I'm planning to bring my race bike--not like it's a ridiculous $12k vanity piece, but still definitely a target for theft that I'd prefer to keep indoors. I know there are bike rooms for some residence halls but it's still a public space with considerable risk.",

As long as you get yourself a really good lock, I think you should be ok as it is very secure. The only downside is that it\u2019s in the basement, so you will have to bring your bike up and down the stairs.",

In any case it sounds like it should be fine. Race bikes like the ones OP and I have are all pretty trivial to take up or down stairs so that should be fine. Since I bike to get around as well as race I might bring/buy a cheap daily rider too, but I'm thinking I can just lock that up in or near the building without much issue.",

Note, I took it a couple of years ago with a professor who youre unlikely to be taught by.\n\nThe course isn\u2019t to \u201cdifficult\u201d as it\u2019s mostly coding - so you\u2019ll eventually get something working. The biggest hurdles are learning how C works and how to program in linux. Afterwards, it\u2019s all time commitment to get the projects done.\n\nYou should have a basic idea of how to program and to trace your code for errors. imo, the gateway courses should be good enough for the start of ip. Good luck!",

            "comment": "being a CA for IP several semesters ago, I will say this is similar to whatever the first C/C++ programming course you get anywhere, meaning it:\n\n* relies on yourself mostly\n* feels like putting too much stuff into your brain at the same time (personally I think it's unavoidable because the course designers try to teach everything basic about C/C++ in one semester, but once you make it through you won't need to worry about C/C++ for your whole undergrad)\n* probably your first experience working with terminals\n\nCompared to some other schools I think it is reasonably well self-contained if you have some programming experience. You just have to spend some time. \n\nIt's almost a test for lower undergrad CS students, if you want to enjoy CS and be a happy coder you probably gonna think IP is actually easy. if you struggle a LOT maybe a CS career is not the best thing for you. Not the hardest course in CS but definitely a glimpse of it",

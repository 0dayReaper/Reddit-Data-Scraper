            "comment": "Honestly, very good. I don't know if there is much else to say. I would pick it over UT Austin in a heartbeat, I didn't apply to Austin at the time but chose JHU over similar state schools. Imo people tend to embellish how good the state schools are if they have a strong program on something specific. Austin is a good school but I don't think you will have access to find the amount of opportunities you would get at JHU. The biology side kind of overshadows all other but that doesn't decrease the quality of other programs. It is a reputable program, there are a lot of people going FAANG+ and lots of research opportunities (especially in NLP/comp bio/ML). It is very flexible, you take like 40 credits of unrestricted elective classes. Also JHU in general is very flexible with majors, declaring a major or minor (with the exception of BME) is incredibly easy and takes a few days at most. There are no barriers on that stuff. So you will easily be able to double major. The JHU name is also better in general if you want to have a career outside Texas.\n\nIf you have specific questions, feel free to ask. All things being equal, and with interest in double majoring, I would pick JHU. I have no idea about the honors program at Austin though, so take this with a grain of salt.",

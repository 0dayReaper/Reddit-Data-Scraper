I took both ph biostats and prob stats for physical engineering, and indeed they are very different. DM me for more details. Also, as a public health major, i wanna say that you can also take biostats in your junior fall(assume you are sophomore now). you will definitely finish all the core requirements by the end of your junior year.",

    "postText": "How is Physics II with Reich? Any tips for how to do well in the course? I've heard such bad rumors about the course that it seems quite daunting. \n\nI used AP credit for Physics I and so have not taken Physics in a year. Is there anything I should review before the course? Also how advanced is the calc for the class? \n\nSimilarly, how is the lab course with Mumford? How much work per week?",

            "comment": "Lab was super easy and straight forward! It\u2019s the same labs every year so if you have a friend who\u2019s taken the class before you can use theirs as a guide. But be cautious cause I know ppl who got flagged because of that. For the actual class itself, do loads of practice problems and pay very close attention to the back tests he gives. There was rarely any calc, I haven\u2019t tooken math since hs and thought the course was doable. I don\u2019t think any studying now will help though. Good luck!",

But now that the earlier poster mentioned that the course isn't super calc heavy, I may not due a deep dive calc review. Hit me up if you wanna form a study group :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! So I am an international applicant joining the MS Bioinformatics (AAP) program in the Fall 2023 intake. I received my admit really long back (November 2022) and accepted it in December 2022. I am seeing that quite a few people in the Fall 2023 cohort have started receiving i-20 related emails and will be able to start their Visa process soon. I have not received any such update for a while and even if I mail the Admissions Office and Office of International Studies (OIS) regarding the same, I don't seem to be getting any response. I just wanted to know if there is anyone specific to contact regarding this, and any other inputs would be really helpful!",

            "comment": "Congrats on getting accepted! From my experience, the OIS is quite slow, and I joined a semester late because I couldn't get the supporting documents to apply for a visa in time. The good news is you will rarely have to deal with them once your F-1 visa is issued, and the annual renewal of the i20 will be done through an online form. \n\nTry to send them an email explaining your situation, and they'll hopefully respond soon. \n\nGood luck!",

After you accepted your offer, been given your JHED, and then created your email account, within 48 hours OIS should send YOU an email with instructions and to how to start the I20 process. Did you check your application email and your new JHU email? \n\nWhen you email ois@jhu.edu, you should include your JHED ID. You also call during their limited office hours. Check their website for when they are.",

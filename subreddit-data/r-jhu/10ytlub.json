    "postText": "I heard this morning that the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center (CRC) would be shutting down - after other groups have begun to share the immense and important job that the CRC did so well, on its own since 2020, for the world. I simply cannot express the magnitude of gratitude and respect I have developed for Dr. Lauren Gardner and her team during the worst of the pandemic.\n\nAt the height of the emergency, I would check the CRC Dashboard, starting at the world-level and drilling down into the data for my local area almost every day, and sometimes several times a day. I took great comfort in knowing I could get the most current, reliable, and accurate information on demand, amidst a deluge of  propaganda and clearly inaccurate \"information\" being propagated by others.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this post, there really is no way to fully express the gratitude I feel - so I just hope that everyone involved in the CRC's efforts will truly know that they have done us all a great service.\n\nThank you!",

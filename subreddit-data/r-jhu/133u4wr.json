    "postText": "Hi! I'm a recent admit to JHU and I was accepted into the BME program, but I'm also interested in electrical engineering, so I have a few questions.\n\nHow strong is JHU's EE program, in terms of job/salary outcomes, courses/professors, opportunities for experiential learning like research/internships/design teams, etc.?\n\nAlso, how reasonable is it to double major in BME and EE or another Whiting major? Can a double major in BME and EE, CS, or AMS be balanced with design teams and research? How popular/doable are double majors at JHU in general?\n\nAny help is appreciated, and thank you!",

            "comment": "JHU EE PhD here, program is really strong for a particular subset of EE research areas (medical/bio related), such as neuromorphic engineering, fMRI design, etc. There are also strong ties to some industries such as Amazon, however, the industry relations are not at strong as more engineering focused schools such as MIT or Berkely. When it comes to academic prestige, such as getting into PhD programs or getting faculty jobs, JHU is very well respected and you can easily get into any program you want if you do good research (which is not hard, Hopkins more research focused than most schools).",

Since you seem to be familiar with programs at other schools, could I ask how the JHU EE program stacks up with Cornell, CMU, and GT EE/ECE, if you happen to know, and if there is a difference in terms of job placement, connections etc.?",

The only downside is that most of the BME companies are in Boston/California so you will have to move for internships and jobs. If you choose Hopkins *make sure you do lots of research.* Hopkins is a really good school for biomedical research and lots of profs are open to undergrad research assistants. Plus you can take design courses which can result in publications. This will help tremendously getting into PhD/MD programs or doing biomed research.\n\nCMU/Stanford is really good for AI and pure CS, GT/MIT/UMich/Berkeley is good for more non BME-engineering problems. You can definitely get into good BME schools/companies from these universities. If you are 100% sure about BME choose Hopkins, otherwise compare tuition prices from other university offers you have and choose what makes sense based on all of those additional factors.",

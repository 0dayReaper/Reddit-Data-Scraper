    "postText": "I created this short, (mostly) anonymous survey.  [https://forms.gle/b2RWcmP8koPdkRGY8](https://forms.gle/b2RWcmP8koPdkRGY8)\n\nIf you fill out the survey, I'll use your results to create a match based on other responses.  I'll select a match based on characteristics you desire in a partner.  I won't reach out to you if I don't think you have a good enough match.  But if you have a match, I'll reach out to you and your match and provide your survey responses to each other.  If you're both interested in meeting, I'll put you in touch.  In the meantime, spread the word, since the more people fill out this survey, the more likely they'll find someone on campus who meets their interests.\n\nThis survey isn't entirely anonymous.  For one, if you like, you can provide a photo of yourself.  But you're required to provide some sort of contact information (email, social media link, etc) so that we can reach out to you once we get a match.  We won't use the email/social media you provide for any purposes other than reaching out to you (we don't have a use for it anyways lol).  **If you're paranoid about sharing your information, then you should only provide responses you would be comfortable with the whole world seeing.**  Otherwise, make sure you're as specific and as detailed as possible to make sure you get an optimal pick.\n\nOnce about 50 people take the survey, I'll start contacting people with their matches.  **I'll routinely update this post with the number of people who have taken the survey.**  Cheers!\n\nEDIT 1: 5 responses so far\n\nEDIT 2: so close to finding a match, but they were both girls looking for dudes :(\n\nEDIT 3: 10 responses :)\n\nEDIT 4: This survey is becoming increasingly popular.  I'm not ready to employ an algorithm with this survey unless I were to get hundreds of submissions, because I think an algorithm can risk making less accurate matches than if a Hopkins student reviewed it.  Feel free to provide survey question suggestions.  Also, more men need to take this survey.  Too many female submissions lol\n\nEDIT 5: 42 responses.  Will go through them today and start to make some matches.  alSO WHY ARE THERE SO MANY POTATO SALAD RESPONSES",

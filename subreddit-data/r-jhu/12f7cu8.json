Thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, is Hopkins as competitive and cutthroat as people say it is? ( I am deciding between the Hodson Scholarship at Hopkins and full tuition at WashU in St. Louis) Any advice is appreciated.",

I had a rough course load and still made it work. :)\n\nHopkins students are high achievers but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is competitive and cutthroat. Just make sure to surround yourself with people that build you up (general advice regardless of what school you choose). Both are great schools and you\u2019ll get a good education at either.",

I was one of three by graduation.\n\nIt\u2019s tough, and the classes are challenging, but I don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019m now in a T10 MD-PhD, and getting your ass handed to you by the ChemBE curriculum makes you laugh at anything that comes after. I have breezed through the first two years of medical school. That being said, here are the only two conditions I recommend. 1. You have a substantial interest in pharmaceutical development or the research done in the department. 2. You like computational biology or plan to have a math-heavy career. There are some advantages, engineering majors can claim research for graded credit, and you can flexibly define your core curriculum on the AMCAS application to affect GPA calculations, etc. DM me for more details.",

I know several pre-med chembes and our major is pretty tight. You should also note that it's very easy to change or add majors at jhu in freshman or even sophomore year and still have enough time to finish all requirements. \n\nCongrats on your scholarships!",

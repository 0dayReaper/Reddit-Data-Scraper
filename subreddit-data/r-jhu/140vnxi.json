            "comment": "Took the course last time it was offered (FA2022) and it was pretty manageable, you are assigned papers to read before every class and there is usually a short quiz. There are also exams based on the papers. Overall it's not too bad, grading depends a lot on the TAs since they are also the ones making the questions most of the time. \n\nThe papers can be hard to understand sometimes and there is a lot of information so it can feel like a memory dump type class. If you like reading papers though (I really don't) it's the perfect class for you.",

However, you should be able to at least put down an answer for most questions and get partial credit. There were usually some basically free questions on exams that you could always answer as long as you looked at the paper.",

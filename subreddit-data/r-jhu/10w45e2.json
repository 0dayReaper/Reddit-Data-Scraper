    "postText": "Hi all, I am asking some questions on behalf of a friend who is planning on transferring to Johns Hopkins University as a 3rd year student for biology. They would be a domestic non-instate student and they would be transferring from a liberal arts formatted education with a relatively small student body (i.e. \\~2000 students). Please share any opinions or facts you think would be useful for them that will help influence their decisions!\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. what is the social life like? i am an introvert so not really interested in the party scene, but curious about the social environment besides that\n2. also, how are the professors in general? does it seem like they care more about their research than teaching or are they generally passionate about teaching?",

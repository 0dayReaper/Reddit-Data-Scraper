            "comment": "A lot of classes are definetly curved, but most of the time its in your favor, lol. In my classes the prof tries to get 30-40% of the class in the A range (A+, A, A-) and the average is usually around a B/B+. This isnt true for all classes but a good majority of the intro/prereq classes atleast. Sabotage is pretty much just a myth. There could be anywhere from 50-120 ppl in your class, especially in the large STEM lectures. Sabotaging others to get a better grade is just not possible lol.",

The standards are high and people do stress about getting good grades but I see that as to be expected of an academically rigorous institution like JHU. Many of the quizzes and exams are grade on curves, especially in the STEM classes, but I did not feel like it made the environment any more or less competitive. I can recall only one specific class where the professor capped the number of people that would be able to an A, B, C etc. in the class ( I hate that as much as the next student). In fact, I thought that JHU had a surprisingly collaborative environment.  In many classes, people would create group chats on GroupMe or FB and spread the word around the class to as many people as they could so that people could share tips and notes in preparation for exams.",

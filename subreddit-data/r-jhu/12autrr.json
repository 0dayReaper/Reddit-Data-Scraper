    "postText": "Can anyone who's studied Applied Math or Computer Science speak on their overall experiences in their respective departments? I've heard a lot of mixed opinions about the quality of the programs. JHU is currently my top choice and I'm hoping to double-major in CS and Applied Math, but I'm also looking at USC and NYU. None of them are necessarily targets for tech but Hopkins does have a higher \"prestige\" factor and better research opportunities I assume.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has had a similar situation to mine and could provide me with some insight. How was the recruiting process for internships and job opportunities? Is it actually anymore difficult to break into big tech or unicorn roles coming from a \"non-target\" school? In hindsight, do you have any regrets choosing JHU? Did you find that the name associated with JHU helped at all in opening new doors? The social aspect is also important to me but isn't a deal breaker. If anyone has something to say about greek life and JHU's party scene (and if it's as dead as people make it out to be), that would be great.\n\nFor context, I'm from California and COA is around the same for each school.",

You can find fun at Hopkins but it won\u2019t be as fun as USC. Overall, unless you\u2019re really tied to California and really prioritize partying, you should probably pick Hopkins.",

            "comment": "AMS major, I can\u2019t speak for other schools but I\u2019m not thrilled with my experience so far. I didn\u2019t find lecture helpful for most classes. It\u2019s a ton of homework. Also personally didn\u2019t find a lot of fellow AMS majors super friendly. But most frustratingly, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been in a single class that focused on practical applications. Maybe that\u2019ll change with the upper levels I take next year, but unless learning for the sake of conquering a mountain of information for an exam is all you need to feel fulfilled, I don\u2019t know how people enjoy their first 2-3 years of core requirements in the major. There are other classes I\u2019ve enjoyed taking here, but almost none of them were math :/ \n\nAs for CS, from my limited experience with it, combined with what I heard other ppl in it say and what I hear people in other schools say about their programs, it\u2019s pretty simple. Eat shit, get the prestige from the degree and let it open doors for you. I think other schools do it better than JHU, but it undeniably opens doors. \n\nI still like it here because of literally everything else that makes up the college experience, but I\u2019d say the required classes from my major contribute to my positive experience here the least.",

No real bad experiences with them.\n\nCS professors are pretty hit or miss but have been solid so far imo.\n\nTheres a lot of people who come and present infront of Hopkins students and a lot of my friends have had internships in FAANG.\nHopkins isn\u2019t really a target school for industry in FAANG, so I wouldn\u2019t say going for Hopkins if your goal is in FAANG is that amazing.\n\nSocial Aspect at Hopkins is poor. A lot of students devote themselves to studying and research, so they are often busy for big parties. That being said, there are some frat parties and small parties here and there. If you want to go to a party then you can def find some.\n\nHopkins students are super hard working and smart. The campus isn\u2019t dead - its just not what you would expect from the American College Experience TM",

            "comment": "Non-target school, breaking into big tech? This is not investment banking, your whole mentality on this subject is pretty wrong. There are no closed doors in tech generally, yes schools help but at the end it's about you. And JHU is one of the best schools in the country. There are a lot of people doing CS/AMS double major and many people go into FAANG after graduating. There are many research opportunities for undergrads if you want to go down that route and Hopkins is not an unknown school in the tech scene like you think it is. \n\nImo, ignoring all other aspects and focusing on CS/AMS, JHU is leagues better than the other schools you mentioned. NYU and USC are both good schools but on this subject and in general, I wouldn't consider going to one of these over JHU. However, I'm pretty sure their party scenes are much much better than ours. If your social scene is based on parties and stuff, that might be a factor in your decision.",

    "postText": "Hi guys - I am an incoming ECE PhD student at JHU Homewood. For rent, I am interested in Mt. Vernon (1,5-mile walk long from campus) since:\n- this area is reachable by Blue Jay Shuttle\n- on average, price points are affordable for well reviewed apartments\n- people wrote that Mt. Vernon is relatively nicer and safer compared to other area\n\nMy asks:\n\na. Distance wise, is it reasonable to live in this area?\n\nb. Could you inform me which stop of Blue Jay Shuttle that go by Mt. Vernon? And at what times?\n\nc. Do many Hopkins's kids live in this area?\n\nd. Any other thing to add?",

Very convenient, 10 minute shuttle ride each way.\n\nc, not a lot of undergrads. But Mount Vernon has a lot of grad students and young working professionals. If you\u2019re a PhD student I honestly feel like you might like the crowd at Mount Vernon better.\n\nd, I lived in Mount Vernon for 2 years and am how living in upper Charles village. I definitely think Mount Vernon is a better place to live.",

It is nice that Mt Vernon is within shuttle range, but sometimes you have to wait a while even once you get in the shuttle because they are making a bunch of trips up by Homewood. But it will get you home eventually.",

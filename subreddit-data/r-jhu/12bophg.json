    "postText": "Hello all! I'm a high school senior, and I'm very grateful to have been admitted to some really great colleges. I'm planning to major in cs, but I plan to double major in physics as well, as I'm inclined to pursue graduate school in quantum computing. I'm also interested in quantum materials and solid-state physics, and I hear Hopkins is great for that. In cs, I'm generally interested in algorithms as opposed to systems. Still, I want to make sure the school I go to gives me the job opportunities I need as well, in case I change my mind on grad school or it doesn't work out.\n\nCost is the biggest factor: I got into some other t20s, but the cost is just too much :((.I'm a Hodson Scholar at JHU, but I'd have to take $10k of loans each year for Johns Hopkins, which isn't all that bad but still substantive.I have a full ride Banneker/Key Scholarship at UMD, so it would be completely free all four years. Since my parents wouldn't have to spend their college savings, I would be able to use the money they've saved up (&gt;40k) for other endeavors if I went to UMD.\n\nThen there's social life and fit: I want to attend a rigorous university with interesting, motivated, and well-rounded people. I like people who are smart and excited, with diverse and well-rounded interests, but not total grinds (no offense to the grinds out there, you guys stay winning). Which one would better offer that?\n\nSince this is the JHU subreddit, I expect you guys to be biased in favor of it, so instead of asking you which is the better option (which you can still feel free to answer), I'd like to know how JHU measures up across those categories. How well does it prepare for industry (FAANG / startups / general cs recruitment)? How robust are its programs in cs and physics, especially in preparation for/acceptance to grad school? How's campus life in general-is it easy to find smart, interesting, and driven friends? Looking forward to hear your thoughts!",

            "comment": "40k for JHU is worth it IMO. \n\n1. *How well does it prepare for industry (FAANG / startups / general cs recruitment)?*  \nWe don't get any significant recruiting except one career fair that usually has Bloomberg, Yext, and occasionally Meta/Amazon. The upside of this is that the fair is really chill and interview spots aren't very competitive.   \nHaving said that, a lot of people do get into big tech/quant (and, honestly, it feels like half the people I talk to are going to Amazon, Google, Bloomberg, IMC, etc).   \n\n2. *How robust are its programs in cs and physics, especially in preparation for/acceptance to grad school?*  \nThe Physics department is great especially if you're interested in Astrophysics. Lots of opportunities for research, famous professors, and great funding. I have two friends who are going to Princeton and Yale for their PhDs.  \nThe CS department is okay. Course selection is pretty small and there seems to be a faculty shortage. However, becoming a TA/working on a project with a professor is really easy and you can definitely get into a good Master's program from here. But I'm not sure how competitive it is for PhD.",

            "comment": "JHU, I was in a similar dilema with UMD va JHU and had the full scholarship to UMD and all. But was a International studies/ Political Science major. What made the difference for me was the fact that the Hopkins name automatically opens doors regardless of the initial recruiting out of school. Long term JHU name makes everyone know the type of student you are and instantly brings you in to a special circle of academia and society. Now Hopkins socially is a different story, but, I think Hopkins is definitely worth 40k.\n\nAlso if you join campus and get into Greek life you will have a pretty decent social life here. \n\nAnd last thing on careers I know personally know like 10+ people who go to FAANG in one year. UMD CS is good but Hopkins is good all around.",

My advisor told me it had a fairly intense culture for better or for worse.\n\nIMO, just go with JHU for its undergrad teaching quality and more potential research opportunities. UMD has a good CS graduate department, but you will have less access to faculties and resources as an undergrad in a public university.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions :)",

You can find the kinds of people you're looking for at both schools without too much effort. I went here because they gave me good financial aid, but if it's a free ride vs taking out loans, and both schools are good, .. I mean in my opinion it's a no-brainer.\n\nHopkins is a better school, but absolutely not better enough to justify coming here and taking out loans vs going to UMD with &gt;40k in pocket.",

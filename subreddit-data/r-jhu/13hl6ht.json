    "postText": "   First of all, so unbelievably excited to be coming to jhu in the fall.\n   Second, i\u2019ve been thinking of bringing my car in the fall but i\u2019ve heard mixed answers on whether i should or not. I\u2019m from the south, but i have family that lives 30 minutes away from homewood, so i thought it\u2019d be nice to be able to see them some weekends when i have time. I also thought it\u2019d be convenient to drive to the inner harbor with friends, or to other places since the area outside of homewood doesn\u2019t look the nicest. Online says not to as freshman cannot park on campus w/o permission, but when I came to campus for an admitted students tour, some of the current students said that I should bring it, and you just need to find a good parking off campus. \n  So, in the end, is it worth it? Is it even possible to bring my car? I use it a lot in the south as everything is very spread out here, and while I know hopkins has amenities within walking distance, I don\u2019t really know how to live without my car on hand \ud83d\ude05",

Parking is going to mean moving your car around a lot just to park it. That being said i haven't had too many problems with having my car in Baltimore crime-wise. Just don't leave ANYTHING in your car bc it will 100% get stolen. Personally, I would wait until you live off campus so you can find an apartment with parking included.",

As people said, you can pay to park it at some of the apartments or the colonnade. Especially if you know you\u2019re gonna visit family or use it semi-regularly, I\u2019d recommend bringing it cuz using public transport to get to like Towson or White Marsh for the mall or restaurants is a hassle.",

            "comment": "I would recommend not to bring it for freshman year. You\u2019re going to be in dorms, classes, clubs, hanging w friends, and going to parties. I think it\u2019s nice to just spend the first year immersing yourself in the community and not having the out of leaving on weekends.\n\nIt\u2019s also a bit of a hassle to street park, or pay a lot of money for parking a car you will rarely use.\n\nAs to getting around Baltimore, totally get it, some neighborhoods that feel unsafe esp south and maybe east of campus. You most likely will not be walking there ever. There are many robust transit options to get you downtown from campus including the charm city circulator, JHMI university shuttle, on demand blue jay shuttle, and a few more. Other places better than the inner harbor and more accessible are mount Vernon, fells point, and fed hill. If you want to get to DC just quick university shuttle to penn station and Marc train down (often more convenient than driving to DC)",

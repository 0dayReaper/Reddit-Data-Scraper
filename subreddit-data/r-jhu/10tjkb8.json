There\u2019s fun to be had but you have to find it instead of it being shoved in your face like at a big party school. There\u2019s no culture of going to football or basketball games. Baltimore is fun to explore but you do need to be careful. Campus is nice but some of the buildings/dorms are dated. Some professors are more focused on their research than teaching/connecting with undergraduates. \n\nWith all these flaws it\u2019s still an amazing school with a great reputation.",

            "comment": "oof, hopkins has a lot of flaws that i saw repeated in some negative reviews and wish i paid more mind to, tbh. i do like hopkins, and if you search for it, you can find a lot of opportunities for networking that you wouldn\u2019t find at your average state school. the academics are also genuinely challenging, and class sizes are small. plus, campus is very pretty and kept up well. but it has some major issues that need addressing\u2014 just depends on how much they apply to you and you are able and willing to put up with in the end. \n\n1) if you aren\u2019t pre-med, engineering or another big stem major, your department will have crazy limited funding and be shamelessly deprioritized by the school. getting grants, supplies, holding events, starting clubs etc in anything will be largely ignored. for example, a club i\u2019m in that has nothing to do with stem waited OVER an entire year with about a dozen members and having unofficial meetings to get processed as a club by the school. \n2) i have honestly never been to a less socially warm college (i\u2019m a transfer). maybe it\u2019s me, but you can basically join a sorority/frat and get wasted in a basement every weekend, be an international student and meet people with similar backgrounds, or know people from outside the school. making friends organically is not a lot of people\u2019s\u2019 priority\u2014 they care more about building up a resume than cultivating relationships. \n3) money and off campus housing. so basically, hopkins has a shell company they use to buy out real estate and gentrify baltimore (they also do this in parts of nyc and other areas). they also have a sort of \u201coff campus housing coalition\u201d with every nearby apartment which basically just means the apartment charges way more in rent than they should because they\u2019re connected to hopkins. you HAVE to get off campus housing as an upperclassman, and all the buildings in the area save a couple very expensive ones are incredibly old with pest and mold problems that cost minimum 1200 a month. it\u2019s infuriating. \n4) also just overall if you are not wealthy or upper-middle class, you will feel like an outsider. people here go out to dinner constantly without a second thought. their parents are lawyers, doctors, financiers. obviously this is not everyone, but it\u2019s the vast majority of students. i get gawked at when i mention working service or retail because most kids just went straight from HS to uni with no work experience since their parents make plenty. financial aid can be a mixed bag, but there is a wealthy culture here regardless. just keep that in mind.\n5) this is probably obvious and the case with most prestigious universities, but this school is the textbook definition of neoliberal. i don\u2019t wanna go on a political rant but i can explain more in DMs if anyone wants elaborating lol.\n6) do not, do NOT go here if you have any kind of disability. SDS and professors are absolutely terrible and WILL discriminate against you if you are disabled. it\u2019s basically a joke on campus that hopkins hates disabled students. this applies to all kinds of disabilities and is the worst thing about the school to me. there is also no fallback for illness or a major death in your family, you will just get penalized by the school and threatened with suspension no matter what happens in your life. the students are actually very kind and understanding about all kinds of disabilities\u2014 this is purely discrimination on the part of hopkins\u2019 policies, admin and faculty. i can send news articles, personal testimonials, and more in DMs if interested. one of my professors even said her son is 18 and looking at colleges, and has ADHD\u2014 and she\u2019d never dream of sending him here because of how awful Hopkins is to disabled students. \n\nthis was long but wanted to be honest and thorough. you\u2019ll be here for years so it\u2019s good to learn all you can. good luck on your apps :)",

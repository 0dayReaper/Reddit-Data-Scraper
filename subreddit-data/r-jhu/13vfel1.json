    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman, and I'm debating between these three dorms. It seems like everyone says wolman is the best, but when I look at the suite and room plans, it feels like amr3 and mccoy have bigger rooms and bathrooms than wolman. Can anyone please give me some advice and reviews on these three dorms? I'm not sure how to rank them. Thank you!",

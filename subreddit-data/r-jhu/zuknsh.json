    "postText": "Hi people, just a happy rundown of life and a bit of rant\n\nCame to JHU with super high hopes of changing the world and whatnot, from a 3rd world asian country with scanty financial aid (there's literally just one other intl student from my country other than me). Due to shitty schooling system, I wasn't really familiar with how the liberal curriculum, academic advising, etc. worked, ended up registering for random classes freshman year.\n\nTook Orgo, Calc 3, an intro German language class, and Dynamic Earth with the lab just to explore different stuff, as I came in with credits for gen chem, physics, and calc 1/2. Fast forward November 2021, my mom got diagnosed with leukemia. I was devastated; missed DE labs for 3 weeks, and almost every assignment in german class. Ended up with a B- in that class despite having straight As in exams and orals, and had to take an incomplete grade on DE lab. Had to drop Orgo as well\n\nWent back home to see mom. She was doing better already as they could diagnose pretty early. Returned to campus, couldn't properly finish incomplete assignments, ended up with a D+ in DE lab. Overall GPA fell to 2.5. Lost all hopes for life. Barely managed to stop myself from going to no-return land. Fell into crippling depression. Yet too broke to afford therapy, too scared to reach out to counselling or student outreach.\n\nOh did I mention, I was dealing with a super toxic long-distance relationship this whole time with a dirtbag that could never understand what I'm going through\n\nThat was on the verge of ending. Slow relief.\n\n**Some light at the end of the cave: Spring of 2022**\n\nTalked to Falzone, ended up registering for his 400-level Spectroscopic Methods class despite being a freshman and not taking Orgo formally. I actually had past research experience in organometallic synthesis; he was literally the only one who valued me over what my transcript said. Ended up with an A in his class while enjoying it the most. To new students reading this: take his classes no matter what. Even though people say he isn't a good lecturer, his class is an experience of a lifetime. \"Better\" lectures won't be a penny's worth when you have to work your ass off because somebody else hates to grade orgo papers fairly.\n\nTook a First Year seminar with Dimitri Sverjensky at the EPS dept. Environmental Poisons. The most amazing and humble human being ever. Once again valued me for who I am and my background; ended up performing well with my personal anecdotes on Arsenic poisoning in my country (which he appreciated even tho I was worried he'll be unfamiliar with the context). Freshmen, please please please take his Earth History class, and others, take whichever class he teaches. The humblest gem of a person.\n\nTook Microbe Hunters with Nichole Broderick. Did my first poster presentation in this new country. Really great class. Made an amazing friend even tho she graduated this year :(\n\nStill had a fairly mediocre GPA, and couldn't secure a summer opportunity. Went back home again.\n\n**Begin Fall of 2022**\n\nRetook Dynamic Earth lab to get the grades up. Had to take Principe's orgo as the universe didn't want to side with me. Chirality and a proposal writing class.\n\nWorked my ass off. And it all paid off.\n\nThe D+ in the geology lab bumped to an A-. All other classes, straight As, except for orgo, because of course, the class had to be a weed-out. Eric Hill is the most fun and considerate dude ever. Got to reminisce my old pigment synthesis days in his class. Prof. Marisa O'Connor who taught the proposal class genuinely cares about you as a student. Please take reintroduction to writing with her if you can.\n\nGot the most meaningful research opportunity that pays generously and where I get to contribute to the most fundamental of science. Got another opportunity at a Biophysics lab that I did for research credits, was really great too. Hosted a journal club in front of grad students and postdocs and managed to not make everyone asleep.\n\nMy best friend back home is now my partner, and is the loveliest lady ever. Was there through all my lows and highs this semester. If you're reading this, NNR, I love you more than anything.\n\nSome months ago I had a 2.8 gpa. Now I'm on the dean's list.\n\nHard work does pay off. To those reading this, I'm proud of you wherever you are in your life. Even if everything seems to be going wrong, remember that there will be light at the end of the cave. You just gotta hold on.\n\nAlso shout out to the Earth and Planetary Sciences department; felt like family here despite being a hemisphere away\n\nTLDR: had a rough freshman year, am slowly turning things over, and that I'm proud of you no matter what",

Anyway, just trying to say life is grind. You're going to fail and this won't be the last time. Don't be discouraged if you go through harder stuff. I graduated with a 2.7. failed out my PhD program. But I'm so happy where I am now. It's incredible how much I failed and yet how happy I am now.",

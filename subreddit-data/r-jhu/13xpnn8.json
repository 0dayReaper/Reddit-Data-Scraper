            "comment": "Edit b/c I forgot how markup formatting works\n\nAdvice #1: Talk to your academic advisor\n\nAdvice #2: Take Reintroduction to Writing (the class formerly known as Expos)\n\nAdvice #3 Go directly to Organic Chemistry 1 (use discernment to decide if you are actually unprepared for OChem or just suffering from imposter syndrome)\n\nAdvice #4 You do not need credit for Gen Bio for the Mol Cell major. Your first Mol Cell class will be genetics in the spring. If you must satisfy a bio craving in the fall, some options include:\nBio dept Freshman seminars (Tuberculosis w/Horner etc.);\nPEBL if you really want some heavy biochem in your life;\nBiophysics, Neuroscience, behavioral bio, public health, ChemBE, BME, Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences all might also have stuff that appeals to you\n\nThat\u2019s the only stuff that needs to be in 1st Semester. My remaining Recs can be there or can float later depending on interest and availability \n\nAdvice #5 A computing class. Options include:\nIntro to computing in Biophys (Edit:I took this one and it was great);\nGateway Python in CS;\nScientific computing classes in BME/Stats/ChemBE (I\u2019m not terribly familiar with these but I\u2019m pretty sure they exist)\n\nAdvice #6 A stats class. Recommend Intermediate Probability &amp; Statistics (which I believe is the course formerly known as Probability &amp; Statistics for Physical Sciences &amp; Engineering/Biological Sciences and Engineering)\nProbStats for Biological sciences &amp; Engineering counted as an Upper level biology elective credit for mol cell so Intermediate ProbStats will probably as well.\nYou will be able to take this class directly upon entry b/c of your Calc BC credit. However most people wait till they have settled in to Hopkins to take Statistics \n\nAdvice #7. A psych class. Dr. Firestone\u2019s version of Intro to Psych was a great survey of the field when I took it. I believe it is now taught by a different professor and I hear it is still good. Any of the other big lectures the department offers should be good as well, they\u2019ll just have different testing/work expectations from professor to professor. DISCLAIMER: NO PSYCHOLOGY CLASS WILL PREPARE YOU FOR THE MCAT. Don\u2019t expect that from the classes. When you get to the MCAT study the Khan Academy Psych/Soc sheet and that should prepare you better.\n\nAdvice #8 Take classes that interest you! You have a lot of time at college. your major &amp; your degree as a whole are designed to be spread over 4 years. Your major is also very flexible. The only course prerequisites external to your major are OChem 1&amp;2 (for biochem), and Physics/Statistics (for some upper-level electives idk which). Most of the classes in the major with prerequisites rely on 4 of our 5 core lecture classes (Genetics, Mol Bio, Cell Bio, Biochem; the 5th is Dev Bio). You should be done with those 4 in either sophomore spring or junior fall (depending if you double up biochem &amp; Mol bio in soph fall). You have so much time for exploration, excitement, and learning outside of those major classes; Use It!",

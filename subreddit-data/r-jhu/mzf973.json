Most of my finals are open-book and I just see no reason to even study. How are y\u2019all getting the motivation to complete these last few weeks?\n\nThe end can\u2019t come soon enough.",

I know it sounds really stupid and I would have thought so too before I tried, but I just started meditating and it\u2019s been helping me a lot. We get a free Calm app subscription through the school and I highly recommend it",

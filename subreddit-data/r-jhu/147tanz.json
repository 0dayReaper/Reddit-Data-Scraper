    "postText": "I am an incoming PhD student in WSE starting this fall. I have a good laptop, and I was planning on purchasing a desktop or atleast buy 2 monitors so I can have a double monitor setup to make working at home easier. \n\nOne of my friends at JHU told me that grad students usually just bring their lab desktop back to their apartment to work (is this true?), so I wanted to ask the grad students for their advice. Is it worth buying a new setup, or should I just use what's provided in the lab?",

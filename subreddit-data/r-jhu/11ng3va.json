Hiring 200+ staff and building out a brand new dining program in the middle of the pandemic was far from ideal but they pulled it off--and the main objective of that change was to improve the dining experience for students.  \n\nSo there have been a few bumps in the road and adjustments along the way but as a frequent customer of most of the dining locations on campus I can say that they are trying hard to fix any issues and improve the overall program.",

Recently there have been sanitation/good poisoning issues but then seem to have gotten a handle on that.\n\n2) They are both \u201call you can eat.\u201d \n\n3) As of this year a customizable sandwich station is available in the dining commons nearer to the freshman dorms. Falls under the all you can eat.",

There are two dining halls and both are all you can eat. Hopkins cafe, the main dining hall, has a customizable sandwich station. Charles street market has one too but for dining dollars",

            "comment": "I would say the food is pretty okay overall. It's not bad and usually you can find something alright between Hopkins Cafe (or FFC as people still call it even though the name changed) and Nolans which are the meal swipe locations or Levering and Charmar which are the dining dollars locations. Hopkins Cafe and Nolans are both all you can eat because you swipe in with a meal swipe then are free to eat all the food you want until you leave.  \n\n\nI would definitely recommend having snacks in your dorm and varying the places you eat at because you will get tired of the food really fast if you go to Hopkins Cafe every day for every meal.",

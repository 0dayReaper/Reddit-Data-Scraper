    "postText": "I was accepted into the chemistry phd program at Johns Hopkins and am super excited! I have heard great things about the program, but had a few questions for any current students/alum.\n\nHow is the culture? Definitely trying to avoid an overly toxic grad school experience if I can. \n\nHow is the work life balance? Obviously this is group dependent, but generally speaking. \n\nHow is the cost of living relative to the stipend? Mine will be 35,500 per year I think. \n\nIf anyone has any insight that would be great, I\u2019d love to understand a little bit more about the school before going to visitation. Thanks so much!",

    "postText": "Now that senior year is coming to a close, I've been looking at what courses I could possibly take next year as a BME major and am a little confused about how the courses come together. \n\nI'm coming in with quite a few credits for: Calc I, II, and III (Dual Enrollment); Chemistry I and II; and Physics I and II. I think I might be interested in the 3+1 program, based on what other people have told me about it. \n\nDo I have to take more specialized courses like statistical physics my sophomore year, or could I take it my freshman year (and is that even a good idea?) Do BME courses follow a progression or do they tend to be more modular?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "The boot camp courses are somewhat progressive, so for example you\u2019ll use what you learned in Linear Signals and Systems with Miller with Systems and Controls with Sarma (not sure if these are still the professors but this was the case in 2018-2019). I doubt they\u2019ll let you take these courses as a freshman but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. \n\nI would use your freshman year to clear out any prerequisites for upper level focus area specific classes or graduation requirements like humanities or organic chemistry if you\u2019re premed.",

            "comment": "If you're entering with lots of AP credits for intro classes, then it's your choice whether you want to start taking the sophomore classes a year earlier or not. I chose not to do that and took lots of distribution requirements my freshman year instead. It was a lot more chill, I got to go through the \"BME experience\" with people in my year, and I'm still graduating a semester early. On the other hand, I know a couple people who did the accelerated schedule, and it made it easier for them to graduate a year early or do the 3+1 program.\n\nYou'll be be fine either way. Talk to your advisor (do all freshmen still have Cathy?) for more guidance. I remember seeing a 4-year course plan for the accelerated course schedule a couple years ago, you can ask if they have that available.",

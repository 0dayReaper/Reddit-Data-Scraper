    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m a transfer student majoring in public health and JHU has been my dream school ever since high school. I applied to JHU last year for my ED II but got waitlisted, so I\u2019m now reapplying as a transfer student. Do you think the public health studies program for undergrad here is so popular that no seats would be available for transfer?\n\nThx and I\u2019m really looking forward to joining JHU this fall\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

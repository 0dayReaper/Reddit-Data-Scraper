It\u2019s not the huge boost  being recruited can be at other schools, but it helps so definitely try chatting w the coach for your sport! \n\nThe only sport you see an actual, massive diff is lacrosse. you can really tell in class discussions / projects how different their admission standards were \ud83d\udc80",

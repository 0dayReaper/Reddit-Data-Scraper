    "postText": "Hey y'all. I am a rising senior trying to decide which colleges to apply to for CS. I've heard a lot of mixed sentiments concerning the CS program at JHU (courses overbooked, glitches, etc), but am still thinking of applying because I'm interested in CS + Health (like AI in medical imaging).\n\nI wanted to ask---\n\n1. What type of student should pursue CS @ JHU?\n2. What makes the program different from other CS programs (in good or bad ways)?\n3. Are research opportunities present for CS undergrads in medical AI?\n4. Professors---Are you able to make close relationships with them? Do you feel like you're genuinely learning, or are missing out/confused most of the time?\n5. Location lol\n\nThanks.",

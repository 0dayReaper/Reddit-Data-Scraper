    "postText": "I'm a CS major concentrating in ML. I really enjoy math and theory, and I'm looking to take some upper-level math/ams courses. \n\nFor those who have taken Real Analysis/Opti, any opinion on which of these classes might be more worth my time? I know opti more practical and potentially more relevant to my field, but I've heard good things about analysis (don't mind if it isn't super practical, mainly just looking for an enriching class).\n\nAlso, would love to know what the workload is like for these classes (especially analysis).",

            "comment": "I took Analysis with Bernstein in F21. I thought it was a very good class, and that he does a good job of unpacking some of the mathematical detail required for the class. The homeworks naturally take a bit as you try to reason through the proofs but I remember the TA being really helpful when I took the class.\n\nI also took opti with Lubberts in S20. It was also a very enjoyable class, and he still went into decent depth, at least enough to illustrate what the optimization routine is doing. I\u2019ve heard the course is even better when Fishkind teaches it.",

            "comment": "Analysis sharpens your general math skills, which makes future math classes easier, but it\u2019s also highly dependent on the prof because it\u2019s pretty difficult to learn on your own. It\u2019s more interesting mathematically; it\u2019s in the pure math department. it\u2019s a more rigorous treatment of single variable calc and begins by building the reals. \n\nOpti is, as you say, very useful for machine learning. The first month is a rehashing of calc 3 and Lin alg, and then after it goes deeper into the optimization part of it. Definitely more on the applied side.",

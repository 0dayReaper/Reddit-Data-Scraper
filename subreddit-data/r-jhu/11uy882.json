I know that the union is negotiating with the university to raise the stipend amounts. Does anyone happen to know what the increased amounts would look like, whether in numbers or percentages, or is it all too up in the air at the moment?",

Also, it is likely that the CBA will specify a minimum stipend, and a department/school may set a higher number. \n\nSo, it\u2019s too early to say. My guess, though, is that whatever the number is for the fall is not likely to change.",

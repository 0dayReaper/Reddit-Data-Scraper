I barely ever see students celebrating Hopkins or being positive about being here. I am not sure where the toxic &amp; backstabbing Hopkins student narrative comes from because the people I have met are all craving to feel connected and support each other. But for whatever reason, everyone is kind of stuck in this mindset that you can't have a positive Hopkins experience, and you have to stressed out or angry at the institution all the time. \n\nPlease let me know if you have noticed this constant pessimism around the Hopkins too or perhaps I am just constantly coming across the wrong crowd.",

            "comment": "I don't honestly think the Hopkins undergrad experience is that terrible, but I think there's a few factors at play here. I'll list some factors that I think are avoidable on a personal level or not institution-related, because I think people already acknowledge the institutional problems.\n\n1. You're on reddit, where most people are incredibly pessimistic. People generally don't come here to write about the great times they're having. It's kind of an endless doomscrolling party across the entire platform. The overall atmosphere permeates into /r/jhu as well.\n\n2. People often do it to themselves. I have had to talk so many friends out of taking 3 million credits + 2 research labs because they felt it's what they \"had\" to do. You don't have to do it - pick a few things you like academically/professionally and focus on those. Otherwise people crumble under the weight of their own ambition, which often provides very marginal professional advantages for the personal suffering endured. There is also a culture that suffering is virtuous, which I think is ridiculous. People will spend 14 hours in Brody performing suffering instead of actually getting work done and then leaving to have fun or go to the gym.\n\n3. Obsession with perfection. I remember going on a date with a girl on the first week of classes who was so stressed about doing everything perfectly that we ended up speedwatching a movie she needed to go through for a film class, and she left my place at 2AM to go finish all her readings and some extra before the sun rose. Aside from doing things earlier, she could have just skimmed the important bits and read the synopsis if she was getting to this late. She could have also done NONE of this and been fine. People sometimes feel they need to optimize every possible academic variable instead of focusing on the important things. Students of Hopkins caliber are also the kind of students to take no joy in receiving an A, and yet to metaphorically whip themselves for anything A- or below. \n\n4. It's covid. The \"play hard\" part of the \"work hard, play hard\" principle is difficult if not impossible to realize, and so all you end up with is \"work hard\". This just isn't sustainable beyond maybe a year. Not to speak of all the national and individual trauma coming out of the pandemic.\n\nIf I have time I'll write about some of the institutional problems but for now I'm curious if people have observed these same things.",

            "comment": "Homewood Class of 2020 Alum +  Grad Student at Affiliate\n\nTLDR: Hopkins can be fun, but you have to chase it. It doesn't come to you on a silver platter.\n\nHonestly, even though I \"hated it\" while I was there, in retrospect, I actually really enjoyed my 4 years at Hopkins. Plus, I have a good gauge of what pre-COVID Hopkins was like too. I think there are several factors at play.\n\n1. 100% agree school spirit is not a thing here. My friend recently started a PhD at UMich and it could not be more black and white. I think a lot of this is due to JHU being a small private school with a lack of sports culture and being a bubble in Baltimore. There's no sense of community, neither internally nor externally.\n2. The student body. A partial response to the Vandy person complaining about how the party scene here sucks -- what do you expect of a uni full of researchers/academics? I felt like I had a fulfilling party experience but those parties were mostly hosted by clubs I was a part of or friend groups. IF you're looking for gigantic sweaty frat parties though, then this isn't the school. \n3. Your major. I did IS which is literally a guaranteed A for effort, so I was free to go bar hopping with friends every Friday night in a way my CS friends weren'[t.](https://t.one) This doesn't mean you should major in IS just for the fun tbc (my friend did that and regretted it).\n4. Administration. As someone who had to deal with OIE (i.e. the office of inequity), I can safely say my opinion of \"Hopkins\" tanked as a result of my experience with OIE. The blatant disregard for student safety, equity, and wellbeing is not unique to Hopkins, but it definitely seems more hypocritical given it is the #1 \"public health university.\" \n5. Your own effort. The worst semester for me was my freshman fall, where all I did was study then watch anime once I finished studying. I turned that around, and by senior year, I had a solid set of friends and community in the 3 clubs I really dedicated myself. I also experienced Baltimore as a city more than many of my peers and got to know  locals through my part-time job. Those conversations honestly were more eye-opening than any PoliSci class I ever took, cringey as it sounds.",

Vanderbilt had a lot more emphasis on college being the \u201cbest four years of your life\u201d, had a huge party scene (even if you weren\u2019t in Greek life like me), had a way bigger and better campus w a lot more active and fun student groups. JHU seems to have none of that and has a pretty depressing vibe overall, which I wish I could have anticipated before coming here. \n\nMy first big exam here I went to Brody on a Friday evening and it was packed. It was depressing to see how a lot of students were considering that their Friday night hang out. Like students were chatting and hanging out there until past 11 and actually socializing. The gym isn\u2019t very crowded and even when I go to play basketball at the Rec (even before pandemic) it just feels super dead, like everyone\u2019s at the library or something. My first year here I went to an undergrad party and it was really lame, people standing around talking about courses and pre med requirements. The list goes on (I\u2019ve conversed with or TAed a lot of undergrads over the years and got a general consensus)",

I can't really explain why, but it just doesn't have the same vibrant feel as other elite schools I have visited in the past. The two block stretch of St Paul St. is too small and doesn't really have that much to do.

    "postText": "Hi guys, I was wondering how much people have to pay out of pocket/what your financial aid package (including tuition &amp; board for off campus) is for those in a similar situation to me? I\u2019m pretty worried for this upcoming academic year because my parent\u2019s income increased to between 45k and 50k and we\u2019re only a family of 2. Thank you!!",

Though if you don\u2019t own assets or have savings then I would still feel confident you\u2019d get full if not very close to full aid. Feel free to ask any more questions",

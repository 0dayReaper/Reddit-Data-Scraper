    "postText": "I just got accepted to JHU EP Space Systems Engineering program. I have a few questions for those that have completed it, are in it, or have taken other engineering masters courses from JHU EP. \n\nI will be a bit of a different case, I think. I do not have an engineering undergrad, but a BS in Space Studies. Ill have completed all of the prereqs JHU has asked for before I begin the program (Calc 1&amp;2, Physics 1&amp;2, Programming, etc.). In the info sessions I watched, they said it takes most people 2.5-4 years to complete, depending on how many classes they want to take. I assume that's 1 or 2 at a time. They also said something like 10 hours per week, per class (but remember, Im not an engineer by trade yet). \n\nI also will NOT be working during the program, at all.  I will be getting the program paid for by the VA through the VRE program, and my counselor has told me that I must be full time if the VRE is going to pay for it. With that said, is it feasible to take 3 classes at once with this program? 4 classes? What could be considered full-time with this program? The school wasn't helpful in answering that since its likely all of their students are full time engineers and part time students.\n\nAnother option to be considered full time could be that also pursue a minor in an AS Mechanical Engineering at my local community college since I would only need about 7 more classes after all the prereqs Im doing. What if I took 2 Space Systems classes and 1 undergrad class at once? or 2? Im just wondering about workload. I don't want to burn out. Im also a father of two little kids. I also don't want anything to interfere with my masters program so I can focus on the content. \n\nFinally, I should mention that I almost went back to do another bachelors in engineering, but lots of research and my engineering friends convinced me its not necessary. \n\nWhat kinds of jobs can I hope to get with this degree that might be outside of the box, since its so specialized? For example, I know with a BSME or BSSE degree, those are pretty broad and can do a lot of different fields. However, with the Space Systems Engineering program, Im worried it may be too hard to find a job. Or is there enough \"systems engineering\" involved in the program? Id really like to do THIS program since it would allow me to use my otherwise useless undergrad. It also gives me an option to pursue a PhD in the space field in the future, if desired. \n\nI really need some guidance, as this is a huge decision for me and my family, with a lot of work ahead, and I appreciate any input you can provide.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Most students in the program take 1-2 course a semester while working full time, with most students only taking 1  a semester.\n\nThe way the core classes are laid out require them to be taken in series since they are all pre-requisites of each other and several of the electives also require you to take at least the first one or two core class first. So with that being said, it\u2019s pretty unlikely to take more than 2 courses at once and I\u2019m not sure the program would approve you to do so in the first place. I wasn\u2019t on a VA loan but for normal student loans, 2 courses counted as full time. \n\nBy taking 2 classes a semester with summer semesters, I finished in about 2 years.\n\nThis program will provide you the fundamentals of systems engineeeing while applying it to Space and space systems, so that will really allow you to go in a variety of routes career wise.",

If I can get something that shows that, Im good to go since my VA counselor is demanding I do a full time program since I don't have a job. I also noticed how the 5 core classes need to be taken in order, so the absolute fasts I could do it is 5 semesters. She keeps telling me a full time masters program is only 1 year.",

But again, I am unfamiliar with the VA requirements. \n\nMost full time masters programs do not only take a year unless you started them during undergrad or something. Many of my friends at other programs for various disciplines will take 2-3 years. \n\nRegardless, your counselor should help support and guide you to achieve your goals, not demand you do something with unrealistic expectations.\n\nHave you been accepted to the program? If you are, you should be assigned an advisor who can answer some of this logistics questions for you and help you come up with a plan.",

I was considering going FT for a semester as a career break and inquired about health insurance. They said that EP was only a part time program and I'd be ineligible to sign up. Perhaps there is a cap on the number of classes you can take per semester - I did not ask. Some MBA programs do that for their PT programs.\n\nOne last wrinkle, I believe the EP Calc 1 and 2 courses count for zero credit hours, I'm not sure if that impacts PT/FT status.",

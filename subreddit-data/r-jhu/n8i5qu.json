My freshman and sophomore year I tried so hard all the time sacrificing my social life and sleep, and after my sophomore year I took care of my mental health more, and actually my GPA increased as a result of that although i was taking more challenging courses and doing more stuff. So actually taking care of your mental health will help you even for your academics! :)",

This job is how I feed my family so I have no intention of jeopardizing that in any way.  Just think of me as a janitor on the death star...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if anyone of you were my kid I would give you this piece of advice. What you are doing right now isn't the way.   A degree from JHU can be a really powerful thing.  If you really want to effect change for the better finish your education, become a lawyer or policy maker.  Right now your coming off as a bunch of spoiled brats who are really making life difficult for everyone.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police force is going to happen.  And the truth is this really isn't about the Homewood campus.  No one actually cares about the Homewood campus or the undergrads.  You are a very small part of the Hopkins ecosystem.  The East Baltimore campus is who is going to benefit the most from added police protection, and they really need it.",

But I wonder, if JHUPD is going to be trained by BPD and they have not solved the issue, how is this going to be any different? It was clearly stated that JHUPD will be trained and overseen by BPD. Further, though it is lamentable and quite concerning what you have mentioned, we have to also consider the future problems that having a private police may bring. Installments like these must not just be thrown onto the table as a solution. \n\nAnother note, if you are going to make an argument, please refrain from using derogatory terms. Anyone, and with more reasons, could say the same about you. These are students who are passionate about the issues that occur in Baltimore. They are not ignorant of the crimes in the city. So, if I were you, I would consider the side of those immature teenagers from fantasyland and gingerbread houses. The offensive rants bring down your entire case and completely nulls it.",

They live in absurd houses, sponsored by the bank of mom and dad or wonton loan use and rarely have to deal with any of the issues.\n\nThen you have people like me who actually own a modest home in one of the transitional areas of east Baltimore. I do a tremendous amount of work on public safety- I serve on neighborhood committees, do safety patrols with organizations a few times a month at the wee hours of the morning, and have legitamately solved multiple crimes and gotten real criminals off the street through vigilance and organizing with my neighbors to have a camera network.  In my time here I've seen absurd crimes- from arson to a guy getting curb stomped to a burglary where bars were ripped off my neighbors window.  \n\nThe idealistic opponents can talk about root causes all they want, and well need that eventually.  But the reality is crime is at an unacceptable level around a world class institution who has the resources to do something about it and its past time for them to be able to do so.",

The reality is many med/grad students are super privalaged or some even take out loans to rent more expensive apartments.  \n\n  I bought a house because it's a great investment and doable, but didn't use parents money like many others do to buy houses in more expensive areas. It's an incredibly financially prudent move given using grants and other incentives- I could legitmately have 100k in equity at the end of my program, vs renting as you suggested having 0 equity and spending ~300 more per month. The number of houses I see people buy for 300k+ in their early to mid 20s is crazy. \n\nAnd it really doesn't take that much time and is by far worth it.  I'm making my neighborhood better for me and my neighbors and driving up property values.",

You are taking a risk to your safety by living where you do. I\u2019m not criticizing your choice, because I think what you are doing for the community sounds really commendable-it just seems risky for an md PhD to spend so much time on patrol and in meetings instead of grinding in lab. I also think it\u2019s important to point out that even people not supported by their parents can afford the secure apartments in the area-they are just prioritizing their physical safety and free time to spend doing research over financial gain.\n\nAs an aside, in an ideal world those houses would be safe.

I don't disagree that there are plenty of safe complexes we could've lived in to get safety, but that would've sacrificed the ability to build equity and the benefits that come with home ownership. \n\nAs far as spending the time, PhD, at least in my experience, really isn't that bad compared to med school.  Yeah it's long hours for a job, but having evenings and weekends to serve the neighborhood is really worth it to me (most days anyways).  I do the patrols because I see how much benefit it brings to my neighbors- through organization, neighborhood development, and focus on security we've legitamately made huge progress to making the neighborhood a better place and the police force will be a big help to all that.  I could definitely take the easy and safe route, but I'd much rather put the effort in to build east baltimore into a decent livable community for myself and my neighbors.\n\nMy issues come from seeing the people who oppose this police force, most of whom live in 300k+ houses further south who do nothing to improve the neighborhood and dont' have to deal with these issues fighting against the police force.",

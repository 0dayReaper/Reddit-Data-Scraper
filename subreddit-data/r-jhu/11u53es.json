If you\u2019re into international relations, the JHU School of Advanced International Studies is one of the best programs in the country for it. A friend of mine does the Kissinger Seminar program, where they take a shuttle down to DC to hear IS talks from various big names, and she thinks it\u2019s awesome.",

We are most well known for international studies, but the American Politics and Political Theory faculty are amazing as well.\n\nMost of my political science classes have had less than 10 students and you really get to know your professors.",

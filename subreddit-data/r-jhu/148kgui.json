Calc 2 Eng actually teaches you Calc 2 and is more useful if you need to take physics 2 or other classes that require a solid understanding of Calc. Calc 2 bio teaches you a bit more calculus, some lin alg, and some statistics. Doesn\u2019t really teach calculus like the name suggests",

            "comment": "I took calc 2 bio fall 2022, it's honestly calc for the first five minutes and then it becomes algebra lol. The common opinion is that this is cause most bio kids don't take much more math so they try to shoehorn it all into this one course. Another thing you should know: when I took it it was super easy but some friends took it the semester after me and it was a totally different class in terms of test schedules etc. (For example my version didn't even have exams, just easy quizzes and spring 2023 had what I believe to be tougher quizzes and also a final).\nI can't speak to the details of calc 2 phys but these are just some details about calc 2 bio that might add to your information and help you decidw",

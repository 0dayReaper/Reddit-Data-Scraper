            "comment": "I also applied to ILR and in the end was lucky to attend Hopkins instead. A major reason is that Hopkins has extremely flexible major and degree requirements meaning that if you decide that ILR isn't exactly your thing you can switch to a different major with virtually no hurdles. For instance, suppose you were admitted ILR for history and economics but later found a passion for a different subject (natural sciences, engineering, etc.) it would probably be a nightmare to declare a double major in engineering at Cornell whereas at Hopkins you would be approved in a matter of days.\n\nI think ILR could provide a more tailored community and course work if you were 100% committed to that track but I wouldn't lightly discount a strong double major over a focused program. Most of my friends who are doubling across humanities and engineering are crushing law school acceptances.",

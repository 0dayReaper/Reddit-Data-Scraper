    "postText": "Hello, you may not know me but you should. I'm the guy everyone is talking about. That's right, it's me, Chad Thundercock. Sadly, it seems that the nerds which run JHU prevent an alpha-male like myself from getting matches on Tinder by ruining the algorithm. I guess it's because they're just jealous that I exude testosterone?\n\nFor context, I'm seven-foot-three, have muscles bigger than corgi, and I major in CHEMBE (ladies, DMs are closed; I don't want a nerdy redditor to date me). I just don't understand how a literal gift from God (or nature if you're a hot atheist) such as myself cannot get some CHICK to SLEEP with me. I get swipes constantly on Tinder but since no one looks like Demi Lovato, everyone gets rejected. I'm just out of luck. \n\nI've got an idea which is clever (but not too clever; I'm not a nerd loser like the rest of you redditors), and that's to join a frat. Everybody knows that JHU girls (NOT NERDS) flood towards fine frat-boys like myself because of my huge ego and sharp jaw. Is this a viable option? Will I be getting laid 24/7 like the king I was destined to be? \n\n(Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/n24pqe/anyone_having_no_luck_on_this_dryass_campus_tinder/) wonderful post; no I don't know if it's satire but I sure pray to God it is).",

We will rise together someday but until then I wish you luck. The combined efforts of a ChemBE alpha and a BME sigma can have a profound impact. A rising tide raises all ships, so I hope our combined efforts can benefit all the men of JHU moving forward. Peace out bro..the revolution has begun",

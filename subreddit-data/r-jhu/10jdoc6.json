What it lacks from things like school spirit or campus traditions in comparison to some other schools, I think that it is quite unique in how accessible it is for people to get involved in opportunities that they are truly passionate with. There are so many wonderful research opportunities available to undergrads as well as other organizations that you can really make your own during your four years. Additionally, while there are definitely some people who are not kind or collaborative, if you keep searching and meet others with kindness there is so much opportunity to learn from and work alongside some really talented peers who might also become lifetime friends. So many times my classmates were the ones there helping me understand the material or offering congratulations after even minor successes. I don\u2019t think Hopkins will ever live up to more traditional American college expectations of school spirit, college town culture, or culty campus traditions, but it was a place I had experiences, opportunities, and friends I don\u2019t think I would have had anywhere else, and I 100% would choose it again.",

The professors, relative to my undergraduate experience, are incredibly nice and that (sadly) is new to me -- that would be the best thing for me. By nice, I don't mean \"easy\". I mean they see us as people and I feel some level of mutual respect. I personally don't find it an especially competitive environment, but a lot of us have already worked or are working so like... there's a general understanding that there's more to life than academics. People in my cohort are nice albeit more on the introverted side.\n\nI know you asked for the positives but I agree with one of the commenters below. You may or may not like the culture. I don't think I'm personally coming out of this with a ton of lifelong friends, but there are many ways you could. This doesn't need to be bounded by the university experience. There are other groups in Baltimore (e.g. cycling groups, bouldering groups, coffee folks) and this might be up your alley if you believe in life outside research. \n\nLastly, our experiences aren't homogenous so I'm sure you'll benefit from hearing others' perspectives too. Your experience also depends on the kind of person you are and how much you put yourself out there (if you want to).",

    "postText": "I\u2019m writing this on my throwaway because a few people know my main. Please be advised: there is discussion of suicide in this post. Please don\u2019t read through it if suicide is a trigger for you.\n\nAt any rate, I wanted to take a few minutes to share my story. I felt that in light of what\u2019s been said on here lately and in general about Hopkins, I needed to detail what it was like for me overcoming impostor syndrome and finding my home in the Hopkins community. My hope is that, if you\u2019re struggling here, you can find some inspiration or silver lining from my experience and hopefully find your hidden purpose within this university.\n\nI\u2019m a current senior at Hopkins who\u2019s applying to grad school as we speak. I\u2019m incredibly passionate about what I do both in and out of the classroom, and even though my path to get here was extremely rocky, it got me to where I am today, which is a good place.\n\nSometimes I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m still alive. It seems like I should be dead right now. But I\u2019m extremely glad I stuck it out because I was able to figure out exactly where I belonged in the Johns Hopkins community, and that\u2019s leading me onto better and better things. It\u2019s allowed me to see the things about Hopkins that I love and value, and it\u2019s taught me that being the best at everything is NOT what being a Hopkins student is about.\n\nNote: this is a very heavy post, but I\u2019m trying to be as candid as possible to show anyone who might be in a similar position, however severe, that things CAN and WILL get better, even in the worst case scenarios.\n\nWith that in mind\u2026 here we go.\n\nI started here in 2016 intending to study chemistry, and I quickly found that it wasn\u2019t for me. I also began as a pre-med student, and even though I had an inkling of an idea I didn\u2019t really want to be an MD, I stuck with it for two full years.\n\nI didn\u2019t do amazingly my first year, but I did okay. I had major impostor syndrome, but I downplayed it and ignored what I was feeling, telling myself that everyone felt this way. To make matters worse, my roommate was one of those people who didn\u2019t have to study for anything ever. He got an A in Emily Riehl\u2019s calc III without even barely trying. I ended up declaring neuro by the end of my freshman year.\n\nSophomore year started off okay. I bought a car just for fun. I wasn\u2019t doing amazingly and I wasn\u2019t doing poorly. There was a lot of impostor syndrome and a lot of denial about my own dissatisfaction. This was how I was to assume every Hopkins student felt.\n\nBut then everything changed in an instant.\n\nIn early November of 2017, I crashed into someone on I-83 in the car I\u2019d just purchased two months earlier. My anti-lock brakes were malfunctioning and I didn\u2019t realize it till then. I was uninsured. I had to pay for someone\u2019s new bumper ($750) and I couldn\u2019t afford to fix my own car.\n\nIt was a truly traumatic experience for me. The crash seemed to break a dam of denial in my head, and this sudden mental breakdown sent me spiraling out of control. I began contemplating suicide, and I sank into an awful depression. I barely left my room, I began cutting class, and I started reading up on the best ways to attempt suicide. I somehow even developed bulimia \u2014 I couldn\u2019t keep a single bite of food down. I never actually attempted suicide during the fall semester, though. I got a D in Nervous Systems and mediocre grades in my other classes.\n\nI took the holiday break for myself and tried to recover. I came into the new semester ready to try things again, but the damage was done. I was convinced I truly didn\u2019t belong at Hopkins. I was barely passing, I was headed towards a career I didn\u2019t want, I was withdrawing from my friends (I lived in a Homewood efficiency which didn\u2019t help), and I wanted to leave.\n\nLeave Hopkins, leave Maryland, and ultimately, end my life. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I kept my car parked on 30th street, unmoving. Seeing it at all made me want to break down crying.\n\nMy spring semester quickly crumbled around me. I was trying to stay involved as a tour guide, one of my other big involvements here, but it was getting hard to keep that ever-present smile going strong in light of my own dark mental prison.\n\n3/12/18: the day before a Nervous Systems II exam. I\u2019d kind of bombed my first one (getting less than 50%), and after learning that some of my friends had done really well, I didn\u2019t have the strength to do the second exam. I tried, for the first time, to end my life that night, but I got down from the chair after maybe 15 minutes of trying unsuccessfully to take that step forward.\n\n4/2/18: My first real suicide attempt. I recorded myself playing a piece of music for my mom, then I tried to jump off the 11th floor of the Union Memorial parking structure. Fortunately, a security truck drove by and almost saw me, so I ducked back inside the stairwell and eventually walked back home. I told no one about any of this, even though I had lengthy suicide notes in my dorm for my family and friends, and I\u2019d left my plants outside my friend\u2019s door.\n\nI tried a few more attempts over the next ten days or so. I was either able to convince myself down or the mechanism I used failed. On 4/5, I flat-out skipped my second Orgo II exam.\n\nThe worst part of all this, whether because of my family pressure or because of my own delusions, was that I only saw myself as someone who could be pre-med. I had become completely blind to any and all other opportunities at JHU, and there were lots of things I failed to see.\n\nI failed to see how many friends I had who could have helped me.\n\nI failed to see that I really am worth more than my major or track.\n\nI failed to see that my dissatisfaction in pre-med wasn\u2019t in the difficulty of the classes, but rather in my disinterest in being a medical doctor.\n\nI failed to see that I loved research, and taken out of a premed context, doing research made me happier than almost anything else.\n\nI failed to remember how much I loved music, another huge part of my life. (When you\u2019re really depressed, anything that used to bring you joy just stops being pleasurable.)\n\nOn 4/10, I left town for an admissions-related event. My car had just been towed. I had just gotten back when a friend of mine texted me. I was about to rush out the door for class. He\u2019s not even a JHU affiliate, just someone who cared. I confessed everything to him, then went to Intro Fiction. He called Hopkins security, and amidst my trying to help with SOHOP, they found me and made me speak to the on-call counselor to confirm I was stable.\n\n**It\u2019s been a year and a half since that day, and I haven\u2019t attempted suicide since then. Here\u2019s what changed.**\n\nI let myself be honest about what I really wanted to study.\n\nI convinced myself to drop pre-med. When I told my mom, she didn\u2019t speak to me for two whole weeks, but that\u2019s the price you pay for peace of mind.\n\nI started doing more research. I joined a second lab and I\u2019m currently helping write my second paper, which will be submitted to neurology journals later this academic year. I realized that a PhD was exactly what I wanted, and even though my GPA majorly suffered \u2014 that missed exam resulted in an F in Orgo II, but I retook the course and did much, much better \u2014 several professors here have told me that my research experience more than makes up for my GPA shortcomings.\n\nI started asking people for help. No one can do this alone. I realized that professors and students are here to help us in our quests, and that it\u2019s okay to bounce ideas off of them and ask for advice.\n\nI started going to APTT more. This is an amazing resource, and the students there are excellent. This is wonderful when I have anxiety or depression flare-ups \u2014 I don\u2019t have to keep it all inside.\n\nI met my girlfriend, who means more to me than anyone else in the world. We\u2019ve both been through similar situations, so we\u2019ve been able to be there for each other.\n\nI worked a job this summer that allowed me to interact with dozens of other Hopkins students and make a real difference in the community, especially for the incoming class.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhat I can tell you is that when you\u2019ve been down where I was, it\u2019s easy to focus on what\u2019s going wrong. Strength comes from one\u2019s ability to find what\u2019s going right. It takes work, but if you can figure out how to find the good in your environment, you\u2019ll be surprised how much that affects your perception of it.\n\nAnd there was a LOT of good about Hopkins that I\u2019d been missing\u2026 good that was right in front of my eyes the whole time. I wouldn\u2019t wish what I experienced on anyone, but it did show me what\u2019s really important in life and at this school.\n\nObviously, my suicidal descent wasn\u2019t the result of Hopkins. It was caused by my needlessly pushing myself to do something I didn\u2019t want to do, too much parental pressure, and an inability to ask for help. Don\u2019t make the mistakes I did. Everyone at Hopkins has a place here. The admissions office is a very bright group of people, and they picked you because they know you\u2019re capable of amazing things.\n\nI\u2019m capable of amazing things, and I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m making them happen every day of my life.\n\nYou are capable of them too. I promise.\n\nTo those of you feeling impostor syndrome, take some time and examine why you\u2019re still here. What\u2019s prevented you from leaving so far? What\u2019s something you\u2019ve been wanting to try? Who\u2019s someone you could talk to in an effort to make that thing happen?\n\nTo anyone experiencing anxiety, depression, suicide, eating disorders, or anything else in those wheelhouses, I invite you to PM me so that we can talk privately. I\u2019ve been through it all \u2014 while I\u2019m not a doctor (and I\u2019ll never be one lol), I can at least offer some words of encouragement, some empathy, and resources on campus who might be able to help further.\n\nApologies for spelling/grammar errors. Thank you for taking the time to hear my story out.\n\nTL;DR: Impostor syndrome gets better.",

            "comment": "Great post.  I was definitely a big fish in a small pond when I arrived at JHU in 2004.  Hopkins wasn't even on my radar when applying for colleges, but after getting wait-listed at Cornell, I decided it was my best opportunity.  I know the covered grades during fall semester freshman year are supposed to help you transition into the college environment, but for me, it had the opposite effect.  My dorm friends had some of the worst study habits, skipping classes and basically living a nocturnal lifestyle of video games with minimal studying and I ended up following their lead.  Don't get me wrong; I cherish the times we had together and we all still stayed friends all through graduation.  However, these habits continued into spring semester which lead to me returning home that summer on academic probation.  Coming from a guy who had almost never gotten less than an A, this was a huge blow to my psyche.  Imposter syndrome was real, as was the shame I felt when around my loved ones who wanted me to succeed.  Having a twin who was academically excelling at a different school didn't make things easier either.\n\nI worked manual labor all summer, getting my body stronger than ever before (restoring my self-confidence in the process) and I returned that fall with a sense of purpose.  More of my classes were directly related to my major (MechE) that fall and I felt that I had a better rapport with my professors.  I skipped the late night gaming sessions and got my assignments completed on time.  I can still remember finishing my thermo exam faster than anyone in my class.  I was nervous to hand it in, thinking I must have missed a page or something as I was never the first anymore after leaving high school.  But I didn't; I completed it first and still got an A, and that gave me a huge shot of adrenaline.  I finished the semester on the Dean's List and was able to pull my GPA back to a respectable level.\n\nIt would have been all to easy to fall prey to the worst inclinations of self doubt that haunted me after my freshman experience, but failure wasn't an option.  No one is admitted here on accident.  You were chosen because of your ability to succeed.  Help is out there if you need it, and it's never a sign of weakness to seek that help.  In fact, it shows strength in your ability to make the most of resources available to you.",

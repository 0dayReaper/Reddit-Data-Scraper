    "postText": "I recently decided to pursue MS in Bioinformatics. Was wondering if anyone can be able to tell me their experience with JHU program. My questions regarding the school include:\n\n1. Personal experience with the program? Pros and cons?\n2. How are the faculties and instructors of the schools? Is the environment supportive to students?\n3. Are the program designed to be more collaborative among classmates or is it mainly independent work?\n4. How would students be able to make connection or networking to prepare them for the industry?\n5. Will the program help students with finding lab positions/internships or navigate within the industry?\n6. How do students find job opportunities or lab experiences/ positions?\n\nI would appreciate it very much if there are any insights or tips that you can share :)",

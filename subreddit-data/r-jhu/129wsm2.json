Ochem1 is completely different from general chem and there's really nothing you can do to prepare yourself. Maybe you can go over naming principles but enjoy your summer before college! No need to stress about classes atm. High GPAs are very possible... you'll be fine!",

I was in a similar situation with anxiety about my GPA because of my (relatively) low SAT score and I graduated with a 3.9.

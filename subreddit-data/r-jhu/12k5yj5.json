Nevertheless, many people believe it was the right way to end a war. \n\nThe ground zero of Hiroshima was a hospital, not a command center or arsenal. I am not convinced that killing civilians with WMD is right and justified. \n\nIf we normalize civilian casualties as acceptable cost to end a war, then what is the point of rules of engagement and Geneva convention?",

            "comment": "How do you define evil? To me, evil is something that is in no way, shape or form justifiable. That\u2019s my definition at least. People can do horrible and terrible things that have reasons behind them. Depending on your perspective, those reasons may or may not justify it. I think it comes down to your unique perspective: is this action justifiable? If it is to you, then I\u2019d argue that you don\u2019t see it as evil. For example: I don\u2019t mean to get political, but I don\u2019t think white supremacists see themselves as evil. They believe, in their own twisted way, that what they are doing is justified. I don\u2019t and I think they\u2019re evil. Their justifications are completely invalid to me. So anyway thanks for coming to my tedtalk (2011 alum)",

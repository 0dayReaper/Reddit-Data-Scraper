            "comment": "Pure mathematics research is not like other research. It's done with pen and paper (and maybe some graphing software) - often alone or in intimate groups of a few close collaborators who can bounce ideas off each other and check each other's work. Cutting edge research math is basically incomprehensible even to people who have bachelor's degrees in math. \n\nYou shouldn't worry about trying to do math research as a freshman. Graduate schools won't expect that from anybody - instead they'll look for high GRE scores and glowing letters of rec. Focus on mastering the subject matter, developing intuition and building a solid knowledge-base in undergrad. Also have fun.",

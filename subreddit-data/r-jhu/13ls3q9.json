Do you take public transport or drive to campus? \n\nAnxiety is through the roof about having to commute via public transport \u2014 only because I\u2019ve never lived in the US and am scared of losing my way. \n\nThoughts, opinions, or words of encouragement is welcomed and appreciated \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

            "comment": "It depends where you're commuting from. Public transportation in Baltimore (i.e. not Hopkins shuttles or anything) is pretty bad and I can assure you you wouldn't want to take them on a daily basis. As another commenter has noted, the Marc train is good and the Hopkins shuttle has a stop in Baltimore-Penn station which easily links you to the Hopkins campuses. I don't necessarily think the amount you save is worth it, it probably evens out at best.\n\nI suggest just getting cheaper living accommodations in Baltimore, there are tons. Also, buying a car is expensive -- not necessarily because of the upfront costs but because of insurance, parking, and gas. My partner is an international student who had their license converted, the MVA still considered them a first time driver and is quoting us 400 a month for minimum liability coverage.\n\nLiving in Baltimore, I've seen single occupied studios go as low as 850-900 in Remington and at times even Mt Vernon. If you don't mind roommates, its even cheaper and you can probably live closer to campus. Living near or in walking distance to the Hopkins shuttles can do away with all transportation costs entirely and they're pretty reliable.",

            "comment": "This is a vague question -plenty of people with all kinds of commutes, it will depend on where you live and which campus. Why do you want to live outside Baltimore?  Public transportation in and outside of Baltimore is not great, although there are some places that are reasonable and Hopkins does have their own shuttles.  Lots of nice places to live in Baltimore too, if you don't have a car I would research those options as well.",

Baltimore isn't all that expensive, and plenty of grad students live in the city and either walk, bike or take the Hopkins shuttle without finding this particularly financially challenging - especially doable if you have roommates.  You can find affordable, decent apartments of different kinds near pretty much all the Homewood-Peabody-JHMI shuttle stops (map here: [https://ts.jhu.edu/Shuttles/](https://ts.jhu.edu/Shuttles/)) and near some decent bike connections (map here: https://www.bikemore.net/bike-infrastructure). If you really want to commute from outside the city, I would not take buses or light rail from the suburbs, as those buses are not reliable or fast enough over those distances and light rail doesn't really connect well to any of the Hopkins campuses, but you could take a train into Penn Station and then get on the JHMI shuttle to Homewood or JHMI campuses (supplemented by a greater number of decent MTA/Circulator bus connections to Homewood campus) easily enough",

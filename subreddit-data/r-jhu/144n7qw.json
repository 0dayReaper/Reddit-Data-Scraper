Like my first year I started off tripling mcb, neuro, biophysics, then ruled out biophysics early in favor of neuro, then ruled out neuro after taking neuro cells systems 1. I think once you've taken the first quintessential class of each major (like mol cell being genetics, neuro being BBC or NCS) you'll get an idea of what the rest will be like. I can tell you more about those 3 majors if you like. I'm not premed but went with mcb because I hated the memorization in the neuro major and mcb was a bit more narrow and experimentally focused.",

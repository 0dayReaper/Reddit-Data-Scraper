            "comment": "I'm not sure that categorizing the COVID experience, in particular, as a \"part-time job\" is fair to faculty for a few reasons:\n\n* Most professors/graduate students receive little-to-no instruction in *how* to teach. It took them *a lot* of work to figure out how to do their \"usual\" in such a different environment. Whether the product they put forward was sufficient is, to some degree, a separate question from recognizing those efforts. I'm not sure we get to the heart of the issue(s) in a meaningful way if, in the process, we discount the work that lots of people *did* do.\n* That \"lots of work\" also translates materially into \"lots of time\". I personally spent hours in a role helping faculty do this. For many of them, figuring out even the simplest things like how to record and upload classes was a challenge. There are plenty of different causes here, but one that's really important to emphasize is that many (esp. older, esp. humanities) faculty were *not* particularly \"tech-literate\" when this started. They experienced *a lot* of stress trying to do these things successfully for their students and, in many cases, what you're seeing *is* their best-current effort. On average, faculty tell me they spent 2-5x *more* time than usual preparing for classes. I have no reason to doubt that.\n* Talking about the effort as a \"part-time job\" misses the reality... that teaching itself is, for most of our faculty, a \"part-time job\". That is: *most* professors are hired on \"research\" contracts which stipulate that they spend 50% of their time researching and 50% teaching. (Lecturers have a much higher teaching allocation -- usually 75% to 100%.) It's either tautological to claim that their teaching is \"part-time\", or it isn't sufficiently descriptive enough to adequately describe the phenomena you're experiencing.\n\nI've taken the time to write this because I 100% believe that your meme was motivated by *real* and *substantive* issues that I want to try and address (I spend a lot of time talking with assorted university folks about teaching). I want to encourage you to move *away* from a critique that discounts or dismisses faculty effort because I don't believe it will be helpfully persuasive in its current form. Can you (or others) translate the *apparent* effort/quality gap you're implying into a clearer set of specific issues/complaints? I'd be happy to pass them along and include them in future discussions with university staff/administration.",

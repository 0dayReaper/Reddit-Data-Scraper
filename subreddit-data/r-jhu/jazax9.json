    "postText": "Hello Reddit,\n\nMy name is James, I'm 35 and currently in Rochester, New York. I'm a RIT Graduate; Class of 2016. I was an engineer at NASA and I was also in the U.S. Army. I had to give up my career due to kidney failure. I have Polycystic kidney disease which came from my father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm writing asking for help in two areas (Please forgive me as I am not a writer).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for a live donor that would be willing to give me a Kidney. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs and I will use that gift to go back to servicing my country/ community. If I can get a kidney soon, I can go back into the Army(I'm an Army Civilian - I'm out on Army disability). I would also go back to working with NASA. I was also accepted into MIT Lincoln Labs and they said I could take MIT classes. So there is a chance I'll just go to MIT LL and work towards a graduate degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am trying to Start home Dialysis but it's complicated. However, my insurance will pay someone to help me setup on home dialysis. They will pay $12.00 per hour and I believe I will need help for about 30 hours a week. To be more honest, I'd say I just need help getting set up on the machine and taken off. You will be trained in a home dialysis center and certified. You have to be used to the sight of blood. You don't have to worry about NEEDLES. I have z port in my chest I hook up to so no needles are required; I hate needles. Just to reiterate, I manly need help hooking up and taken off but should be watched for Low Blood Pressure drops. My blood Pressure can drop to 40/20; One passes out from that low of a pressure. You can you lay me back in my dialysis chair where I am flipped onto my head so the blood can go back to my head. Also, need help with cramping, removing fluids from the blood causes me to cramp in my legs and feet. You'll have to massage them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am registered at John Hopkins for a Transplant but that's only with a dead donor and those kidneys only last \\~10 years but if I can find a live donor, the kidney will last 25+ years. I wont get a Kidney from Hopkins until 2025 or so. the list is so LONG. There are so many people on it. Also, I am registered with U of R and saying about 2025-2027 for a dead donor. Both places said if I can find a live donor they will do the transplant ASAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of you may ask what about family donating? Well, My mother tried to donate but they found she has health issues that are stopping her from donating. She has a second Husband that also tried but he also has health Issues. I have a younger sister but she wont' donate. Instead the day she found out I need a kidney, she went to Mexico to get a boob job so she's not donating. Moreover, I am having to take care of my dad who well does not deserve my help at all. He's truly a bad guy; a true definition of a monster. He's done a lot of bad things in life but I need him a live right now. It's something I can't explain over reddit. I just want to say my life is so stressed from the kidney failure, having to give  up my careers and having to help a father who is a monster; No one should have a father like my father. Plus he gave me this disease in the first place; Polycystic Kidney Disease. My family is broken and sad. Also, just found out my mother had a heart attack; I guess the drugs, smoking and alcohol is catching up to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo is there anyone out there willing to help me? I would be very thankful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I don't really have family here in Rochester. I have a father who moved up here from out of state but he's not mentally there and he has a very troubled past. I can't really get help from him. I do have a few friend here that have been helping me but they have families and lives, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to have a kidney so I can go back to being a productive member of society. I will again go back into the Army. When I was in the Army, I saved a LOT of lives because I have a unique skill set. Also, the Army did look into donating a kidney but because of Army rules and regulations, they can't donate. a Soldier who donates will have to leave the Army. However, the Army did allow me to stay in for 14 additional months while in Kidney failure so I could collect Army benefits. So I am very thankful for the Army for what they did for me. Moreover, I would like to go back into the Army as a Army civilian. The unit I was in was really good to me. Furthermore, I've learned that there is a comradery in serving  and I had the privilege to serve in a company of heroes. I'd like to go back to servicing because those soldiers need all the help they can get right now. I do have a unique skillset that I can use to help save lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS; If you want to donate, please call the U of R Kidney Transplant center for more information:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n585 275-5875\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr John Hopkins Kidney Transplant:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWendy at John Hopkins Kidney Transplant: 410 955 6552\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all for reading this.\n\nPS; Blood Type: O-Positive. \n\nWarm Regards,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJames",

I saw 44 upvotes and no comments so I decided to be a little brave today.\n\nI'm not even old enough yet, or of the right blood type. I can't do anything for you. But I just want to wish you luck and hope you find someone soon. Maybe you have heard this a lot, I don't know, but it didn't feel right to not say anything.",

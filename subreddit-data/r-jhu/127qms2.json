    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019ve recently gotten into JHU as a philosophy major and CMU as a CS major, but I\u2019m not sure which would be the better school for me. I\u2019m someone who wants to double major in philosophy and CS(hence why I applied as different majors for these schools), although I don\u2019t really know what I want to do with my life beyond that. The options I\u2019m considering range from Law School to Industry/FAANG/startups to academia to research to even consulting. Cost of attendance is basically identical. \n\nJHU pros\n\n- got the Hodson trust scholarship, which entails some special privileges(not exactly sure what these are or how big they are though, please lmk if you know anything)\n- better philosophy department than CMU, which also recently got a huge donation\n- better overall prestige \n- better for research and academia \n\n\nCMU pros\n\n- much better CS department and CS prestige\n- (much?)better for Industry/FAANG/startups\n- safer location(I like to take walks often so this might be big)\n\nUnsure factors\n\n- food\n- stress level(I heard both are stressful)\n\n\nThank you so much for your help!",

JHU matches quite well to FAANG companies, and in a way it could be an easier time at JHU compared to the stress CS students seem to go under at CMU.\n\nIf you want to go into CS academia, CMU would be better since they have stronger programs in machine learning and such.",

Plus, since humanities isn't as big here compared to STEM, your humanities experience will be more one on one rather than the larger lecture stuff they have going on for STEM majors. It'll be refreshing to have after all of the CS stuff you would do. Imo, Bmore gets a lot of bad rep about the safety issue, but it's genuinely not that bad because the Hopkins bubble is a better part of Bmore overall, but like in any big city you just have to be wary about your surroundings and such. The food is pretty slay, and for the next semester they're improving it with more dining options so there's that to look forward to. CMU CS is also really good, but I've also heard that the stress levels for CMU CS specifically is a lot worse than any other major at CMU. At Hopkins, the stress level would probs be more tolerable from what I've taken and what my CS friends have taken.",

Sure, CMU\u2019s CS curriculum is more challenging, but it\u2019s more rewarding and you waste less time by learning from the leading experts. If you start considering your life after bachelors and unless you truly want to pursue a philosophy only direction, it seems CMU is the more realistic option.",

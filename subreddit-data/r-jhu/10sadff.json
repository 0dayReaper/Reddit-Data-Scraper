            "comment": "Hey! I actually did this program online 2018-2019 while working full time. I think if you\u2019re interested in the subjects, it\u2019s not too difficult as you\u2019re a bit more motivated to learn.  Expect to do a lot of reading and writing of papers, it\u2019s a masters program after all. I did two courses a semester, and spent a lot of evenings reading during the week, and spent a bunch of time during my weekends writing papers. There is a capstone project you\u2019ll have to do your final semester, I highly recommend to begin planning for it early on as it\u2019ll help you stay organized and be on schedule. Also they usually have some sort of field course, if you have the means of doing one, I\u2019d highly recommend it. We traveled to China in 2019 and it was a great experience.\nCareer wise, I\u2019m a GIS Analyst now. I\u2019m always looking out for jobs that merge GIS and Energy Policy &amp; Climate together, but it\u2019s hard finding the right job I want to do. That\u2019s personal preference though. There\u2019s also energy analyst positions you can do, but I swear they\u2019re all mid-senior level and no entry level positions so I\u2019ve yet been able to make the jump to something like that. If you have any more questions, feel free to PM me!",

If purchased through them you also get access to free loaner laptops if [service](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/computing/hopkins-technology-store/) is ever needed (provide on-site at their retail store in Levering Hall 113).\n\nI'm not sure if the software you're interested in is included, but you can check out [OnTheHub](https://jhu.onthehub.com) to see what's available. JHED ID is required to log in.",

Apple also has education pricing on their website so you don\u2019t have to go through JHU tech store.\n\nStudents don\u2019t get much perks honestly and you save 100% if you don\u2019t buy unnecessary stuff. \n\nI would say use school facilities more. Library, gym, going to events etc. You already paid tuition",

The only thing is I haven\u2019t found any other ece majors on any other forum or during the campus tour. Does anyone out there know anything abt the Ece department (i.e. what opportunities there are and how the overall experience has been so far)? The last post was abt 3 yrs ago so any updated info would be super helpful!",

            "comment": "It's a fairly small department undergrad-wise, but the undergrads are a fairly tight-knit group (especially the EEs). There's a lot of opportunity to take courses all across domains that ECEs might be interested in, like matsci, CS, MechE, and beyond. You'll get a solid foundation in ECE fundamentals, although power electronics is a notable blindspot. There's a solid amount of research in signals, ML, and controls, although there's a considerable amount of research in other domains too, and it's pretty accessible (probably in large part due to how few undergrads there are). I really enjoyed my time - I think it has a great community and prepared me well for post-college.",

            "comment": "First of all, congratulations on being admitted and I hope you strongly consider accepting the offer.\n\nThe ECE department is fairly small (approximately 20 EEs and 20 CEs per incoming class), and so you'll find that there are not a lot of undergraduates publicly posting when compared to larger departments. However, this means you build a strong community between students and can forge friendships that develop across semesters. \n\nThe ECE department has many research topics that are exceptional, and many unique opportunities for undergraduate students to join labs. Something special to Hopkins is how faculty encourage students to do research, and many have openings in their personal labs for undergraduates to supplement their coursework. \n\nIf you have any further questions, you can feel free to reach out.",

They seem very friendly and close with each other! However, if you join late and are not the most socially confident, then it\u2019ll be a lonely and hard road ahead (personal experience).",

            "comment": "Incoming ECE PhD here. Much of the research and opportunities in ECE are biomedical focused, though not necessarily everything. Sat in on an ECE design course and prerequisite knowledge (info from earlier ECE courses) was being used to design biomedical sensors in big groups. Many of the professors are doing neuromorphic chips, designing MRI/FMRI, etc type research. Also, people are very impressed when they hear you're studying at JHU. I think it's an amazing opportunity if things like this excite you.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI almost confirmed an apartment from beginning of summer, continuing to Fall and beyond. However, I'm now having to travel back home (outside the US)\n\nIs there anyone who is looking for an apartment ONLY during summer? Like May June July. I'm going to come back in August.\n\nI talked to the homeowner and they agreed with an option like I could ask a friend to stay during summer, then I take over from Fall.\n\nNote that this does not apply to you if you're going to want to have an apartment during Fall as well. Hence mostly looking for people who will be graduating at the end of summer or similar (i.e. with no plans to stay during Fall 2023)\n\nPM me if this sounds like you",

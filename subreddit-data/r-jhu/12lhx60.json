Most of the professors were excellent. I was well prepared for the MCAT and didn\u2019t have to do too much intensive prep besides for psych and reading. I\u2019m now in med school and have aced every exam (without anki), and I know for a fact the academic rigor at Hopkins prepared me to think conceptually, have a strong work ethic, and be able self-learn. If I went to a less rigorous school, I think I wouldn\u2019t have challenged myself as much and would have struggled a bit more in med school.",

I'm coming in as a masters student and I personally value work experience over schoolwork given the impact work experience holds outside. I found that I was largely unable to pursue a whole lot of paid work alongside the demands of my course. The learning outcomes are great and the biostatistics series is phenomenal. However, the expectation to complete an immense amount of units within a term can be limiting for pursuing other prospects that may likewise matter. I'm sure some folks manage to do it, I just don't know how they keep sane.",

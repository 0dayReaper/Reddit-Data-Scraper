You would probably want to store it inside to avoid any theft or damage issues, and that would probably mean renting a garage, which won't be anywhere near your dorm--I'm not aware of any motorcycle-specific parking on or near campus. Maybe someone who has actually brought one to campus can offer more insight, but overall I think it would be a hassle to deal with in the city.",

They are also probably the bikes most likely to get stolen if left out on the street. I have a few old Hondas (1980s-1990s) that people are not likely to mess with. I would recommend getting a bike in Maryland - there are plenty of used bikes to go around. Plus, if you are getting a street license, you would probably take the MSF course anyway, which I highly recommend, regardless of experience on dirt.",

Keep in mind as a freshman and sophomore, you may be tied to campus more and not have as much time for the bike.",

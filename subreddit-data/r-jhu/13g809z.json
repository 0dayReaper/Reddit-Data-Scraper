I know the lecture is too early, and that the professor is boring. I know that you can watch the recorded lecture later, or find a better lecture on YouTube. I know that you might even read the book. I know that your friend got an A last semester without going to class after the first week. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. When I look at the grades in my class each semester, the bottom of the list is consistently populated by students who I have no idea who they are, and the top is always students who show up and engage with the course. \n\nAs has been said, 90% of success is just showing up. This is one of those times.",

I will attend as much as I can but I will be doing Air Force ROTC which will take up my entire Thursday (which I would have scheduled classes). And for some classes that are M/W/F, I will only be at Hopkins from W-F. Entirely agree with you, just trying to what I can do with my circumstances.",

    "postText": "This was wayy back in 2003. Got meningitis, Walter Reed was unable to take my case as my VP shunt made it complicated I guess, or meningitis in general is complicated. I was 8, dad was / is a vet. The people at Johns Hopkins were able to save my life. While it wasn't the best time of my life - I was super out of it, scared, angry because I lost my ear and felt hopeless. My life was saved and there were many super amazing areas for kids (My favorite area / past time tho was sleeping in the couch in the family room). But yeah, thank you. And thank all of yall studing the hard topics to continue saving lives.",

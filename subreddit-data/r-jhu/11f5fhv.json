    "postText": "Hi!  I just started working at JHMI. I saw that there were plenty of shuttles to JHU\u2019s main campus from Penn Station, but there seemed to be none to the hospital campus from Penn. I can take the Baltimore bus, but it adds a substantial amount to my commute. Has anyone run into this issue or found a workaround? Thanks!",

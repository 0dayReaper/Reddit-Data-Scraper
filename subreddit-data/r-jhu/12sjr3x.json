Thank you so much in advance!\n\nMajor: premed (neuroscience or bio) that can\u2019t take any gap years between medschool and undergrad \n\nCost: Duke is slightly more expensive (not a big issue)\n\nDuke:\nPros:\n- a lot of diversity (ppl having various interests other than premed)\n- 85% of premeds at duke get accepted to medschool their !!!first time!!! applying \n- ppl seem to rlly enjoy this school and have a great work-life balance \n- great study abroad programs\n- decent research opportunities \n- great alumni network\n- close relationships with the faculty \n- beautiful campus\n- parties!! \nCons:\n- core curriculum \n- nobody in my home country knows duke and it is less prestigious compared to JHU regarding med &amp; stem\n- too many ppl at my school are already going\n\nJHU:\nPros:\n- amazing research opportunities \n- open curriculum = academic flexibility is on top\n- close to DC\n- very prestigious for premeds\n- already met inspiring and amazing people (everyone was so welcoming contrary to the stereotypes)\n- very hard (or basically impossible) to get straight As \n- my parents want me to go here\n- higher ranked stem in general \u2014 both for med and engineering \nCons:\n- pretty bad work-life balance \n- baltimore \n- basically no diversity (haven\u2019t seen a single humanities student \u2014 all of them are STEM, which consists of mostly premed)\n- 80% of premeds at JHU get accepted to medschool within 5 years (5% less acceptance, along with the fact that this statistic is not just for first year applicants, which is bad because I can\u2019t take a gap year)\n- a lot of competition\n\nPlease provide me any kind of advice, experiences, or opinions. Thank you so, so much.",

Vernon, Canton, Fell's Point are all great places to go out and socialize. \n\nSecond, there are a ton of social science and humanities options at Hopkins, many of them top-rated programs like Writing Sems, International Studies, and History. Maybe it's changed in the decade since I went there but I found Hopkins to be incredibly intellectually diverse and a great formational experience that set me up for success.",

Study Abroad programs are the same everywhere, you pick a country or institution you want to go to and the study abroad office will find a way to get you there. 85% vs 80% for Med acceptance is a rounding error. Both schools have tons of non pre med. If you\u2019re actually going to do medical than either school will do. But I\u2019d consider a backup plan as many premed students everywhere decide it sucks and do something else. Both schools provide the oppurtunity for that. That being said it seems you\u2019ve already picked Duke. The Difference between the schools are:\n\nDuke = +sports +slightly less work +core +in a college town +likely need to be in a frat to have THE best time\nJHU = +slightly more prestigious +more northern/less southern school +in a city +more club orientated.\n\nReally do not discount the fact that Duke is in the south or a college town. it\u2019s culture reflects that. \n\nAlso you\u2019ll barely ever go to DC, and Baltimore rocks. \nSource: JHU class of 2016, Good friend from high school went to Duke.",

Ned school admissions departments! It\u2019s literally their job to know how hard it is to get certain grades at certain schools. Worry about working up to your own standard; this isn\u2019t a reason to choose a school or not.\n\nWork-life balance: every person individually chooses what they\u2019re going to do. You can certainly find friends who party five days a week if that\u2019s what you want, and you can find people who will study eight hours a day outside of class. Intramural sports and clubs and frats are very popular and well liked. I\u2019m an athlete double majoring and sleeping &gt;8 hrs a day and I still find time for other stuff; so do all my friends.\n\nBaltimore: it\u2019s a cool place. Hopkins, with its billions of dollars, works hard to make students feel very safe. Security people (\u201cHop cops\u201d) are ubiquitous in a wide perimeter around campus. Local neighborhoods and downtown are very walkable and very nice. Yes, there are neighborhoods where you shouldn\u2019t walk at night, but for the most part they\u2019re nowhere near campus and there\u2019s no reason why any student would have to go there.\n\nAcademic diversity: Around 20-30% of students are majoring in humanities, probably another 20% minoring. The history dept is excellent, and I know economics and international relations are as well. Most students are stem, but this doesn\u2019t restrict anyone\u2019s options and most dabble in the humanities they like.\n\nCompetition: if you want there to be. There are students who will act like their performance in a class is contingent on yours. They\u2019re just objectively wrong. You can ignore them and collaborate with the other 90% of people, and there are tons of academic support programs like PILOT and Learning Den for peer-to-peer and group learning. I highly recommend these.\n\nGoing to med school straight out of undergrad: If you don\u2019t mind, why do you have to do this? Everyone I know who\u2019s taking a gap year before med school is being financially self sufficient during that time through some medical or bio job. Keep in mind that Hopkins students will apply to some crazy med schools with 2% acceptance rates - Hopkins, Stanford, Harvard, etc. and try for another cycle if they don\u2019t get one of those. The US is full of excellent medical schools, and with a good, not perfect, academic record, you could get into a slightly less elite one straight out of undergrad that would set you up for life.\n\nGood luck on deciding! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this, but whatever you choose usually ends up being the place for you.",

The work-life balance here isn't pretty bad. I go out from Fri-Sun with my friends who are all premed, it's all about how you manage your time and things you value. If you value life-work balance, then you're going to find ways to have that balance. Baltimore being a bad city is a huge misconception with racially involved undertones. Baltimore is so fun, and safe as long as you behave as you would in any major city. The diversity here comes from how a lot of STEM majors will double with humanities. One of my friends is a comp sci major with a minor in visual arts. One of my other friends is involved in enviro studies with their primary being writing sems and film studies. I, myself, am involved in art history here. The perk is that since there's so much flexibility, you don't have to declare majors in humanities to take a bunch of humanities classes, you js do it for fun.I'm not sure where you found the fact about med school acceptances, but I believe our acceptance rate is like 89-90 for premeds and 91 ish for prelaw students. I'm also not sure where the idea of competition comes from in any source, since all premed/general students help each other out because we all know how hard the classes can be. It's generously cooperative. My friends who aren't even in my classes try to help me with my own stuff when the things I'm learning are too difficult to digest on my own.

To sugar coat the crime/city problem would be dishonest. There are problems here and it can be bad. Additionally, the difficulty and cutthroat nature of Pre-Med courses can be incredibly offputting and frankly may even hurt your chances of going into medical school if you do poorly enough. BUT Hopkins has a community of the most intellectually-stimulating, incredible humans who are more than just STEM students. Most of my best friends were not STEM majors, and are incredibly insightful and interesting about subjects you may not have even considered. The outside academic interests of students are broad as well, and there's so many different communities you can become a part of. I believe I made my best life friends here, and despite the struggles I had academically and otherwise, I wouldn't change it for anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, many students end up changing their career path, as they realize pre-med isn't for them and that's totally okay. Hopkins gives you more academic flexibility than any other institution I've ever heard of, and it is very easy to switch majors/add another one. I was pre-med for 3 years before I decided to change careers to Psychology, and I'm now in graduate school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't speak for Duke because I don't know too many folks who have been there (I do know that they feel as passionately as I do about Hopkins fwiw), but at the end of day, you're in a great position and you're gonna do great.

People at Hopkins on average have serious social issues. Also if you pre med you actually probably better off at a good school that isn\u2019t only pre med, because less competition and id imagine of those that go into duke pre med vs Hopkins, people at Duke likely don\u2019t drop it at such a high rate. Also, if you switch from pre med to something else dukes recruiting is miles better. Also Baltimore is a dump, im sorry it\u2019s the truth, last week the blue jay shuttle driver showed me a street and said he knows over 25 people who have been shot and killed there. Can\u2019t say the same for NC. Also within 5-6 weeks week most freshman refer to Hopkins as hell. If you have a chance to go to a a school of similar prestige take it. Even UChicago is better then Hopkins socially. Also if your white you don\u2019t have to worry about dukes southern culture personally, as a brown person that would be my only hold back.",

It\u2019s beautiful though. For undergrad, that might be a nice feature. JHU, on the other hand, is not in the heart of thr city, but it\u2019s definitely in a semi-major city. There is much more going on much closer than Duke, but also less nature immediately around. \n\nDuke students are definitely happy, but a significant proportion are southern/fratty. If that\u2019s your thing, great. JHU is probably less social overall, but also people tend to be more down to earth in my experience. A trade off. \n\nIn the south, where Duke is, everything moves s l o w. People are really nice but also it really feels like you\u2019re in another world. In Baltimore, people may have a gruffer exterior, but they\u2019re also very nice. The difference is everything moves faster than in the south. \n\nHonestly you can\u2019t go wrong. Both great schools. I\u2019d say if you know you want to do research, see which school has labs you\u2019re more interested in.",

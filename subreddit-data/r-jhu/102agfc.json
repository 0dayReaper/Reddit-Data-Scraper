I'm a Junior ChemBE here and I'm looking at the BS/MS program just so I can get my Masters program quickly at JHU before going to get my PhD or go into industry.\n\nAre there any people in this program who can talk about the pros or cons? I've heard from people that its more desirable to go to other universities for degrees after undergrad.",

And for industry, are you sure that a MS in chemical engineering is necessary? Why not instead start working and get a master\u2019s degree later if you need it. Also, you might find an MBA more useful later as you transition into management roles later.",

You can do that with undergraduate research so I am not sure that an additional year would be worth it financially or time wise. You can apply senior fall and if you get in where you\u2019d like don\u2019t do the masters. Otherwise, do the masters and reapply the next year?\n\nYou should probably determine if you want to do a PhD or go into industry because an industry internship would be better if you want to go work, but you should do research either through an internship or at hopkins if you\u2019re applying to grad school.",

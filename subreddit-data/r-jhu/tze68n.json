I walked across St. Paul towards one of the yellow-shirt JHU Security contract staff and told her the guy behind me was being very aggressive and threatening (which should have been obvious to anyone with a heart beat). She didn't even bother to look up, just ignored me while the guy headed up St. Paul towards 33rd st. I should have reported it to (the real) JH Security at the time, but was just happy to get rid of the guy at that point. Definitely need more proactive security in that area.",

I'd point you to u/gbe28's comment on this post, who was being very visibly berated by an individual and the security officer would not even look up from her phone. Security guards should be on the look out for exactly situations like this (Does an individual look nervous? Is a suspicious person with their body mostly covered following them?) so that they can do something to help. But once again, in this specific instances, it seems to be a hole in security coverage from what I can tell.",

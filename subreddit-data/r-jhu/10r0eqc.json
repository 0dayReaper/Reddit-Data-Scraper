    "postText": "From my personal experience, Hopkins has a severe problem with Storage, especially for students who need to move out at the end of Spring and need space to store their stuff during Summer. As a group, we are working on validating and solving this problem.\n\nMay we have your quick precious moment to share your experience or fill out a 1-minute survey:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yPOeJIcQqrnDCXhvmUiM0jXWHoDL02Ytz8IDaGgDFVY/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yPOeJIcQqrnDCXhvmUiM0jXWHoDL02Ytz8IDaGgDFVY/edit)\n\nAdditional questions: What kind of summer storage have you been using and how satisfied were you? What's wrong with it? \n\nWe are passionate about bettering the Hopkins experience and your answer means the world to us! \n\nThank you and have a great semester!",

I applied to JH because I live nearby and how affordable it was considering it is online.",

I got accepted to their online Master of Science in Cyber Security after waiting for a week to hear back from them. UMD doesn't require Calc 1 and Calc 2.\n\nSend me a private message if you want to know about UMD!",

            "comment": "It's pretty good. I took another class with him but they're all pretty much the same. He's actually sort of low-key hilarious. Goes on tons of tangents in lecture, some of which are better than others, but it often ends up being pretty hilarious, if you like his sense of humor. I think he usually gives a midterm and a final exam, because his lectures are sort of confusing it can be hard to know what to study for the exams, but I think most people end up with an ok/good grade.",

            "comment": "Jasnow was the most disorganized professor I could recall from undergrad. He had no syllabus (not one that he stuck to, anyway), assigned papers at random, didn\u2019t know how many midterms we would have, and decided in the last week of classes we should have a final. Rambled a good deal during lecture. The content was actually interesting though, and you could tell he knew a lot about the subject. If you could handle the absolute chaos, then I say go for it?",

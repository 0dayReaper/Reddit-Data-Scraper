            "comment": "So just gonna say that I'm only a first-year as a disclaimer.\n\nI think many of the horror stories are overblown, honestly. Especially toxic competitive culture. You'll have a few jerks at any school but overall people at JHU are pretty supportive of each other.\n\nIt is a hard school, plain and simple. Don't expect to coast through classes. It will be a hard adjustment from HS but if you work, it will be okay. There are a lot of resources to support you like PILOTs, study consulting, etc. so definitely use those.\n\nYou will have time to hang out with friends and meet people if you go to different events. some of my friends and i will even meet up and sit together while we work on homework. It's not a party school by any means, even though people definitely go to parties. There are also plenty of events on campus and around campus, so you will never lack something to do. Baltimore has a lot to explore and decent transportation.\n\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to ask me if you have more questions.",

I mean, it definitely is what you make of it and how social you\u2019re willing to be, but I have friends who go to other top ranked schools and after visiting them for weekends, it really opened up my eyes to how dreary Hopkins can be. It\u2019s not the worst thing and it\u2019s not the end of the world. Especially if your first priority of going to a top ranked school is for the academics not partying. Just something to be aware of though.",

To preface this I came in during the virtual year with COVID. But everyone I have talked to who has been here before says there has been a marked change in the culture post COVID. \n\nIf you value a social life and don\u2019t belong to one of the identities that have a large presence here it not as easy to make friends. People tend to make friends freshman year and stick to them and as a result the school is extremely cliquey. People have an idea of friend groups and are very hesitant to ever let anyone else in and as a result many people feel isolated.\n\nFor parties they are mainly through frats or bars downtown which are 21+. if your a guy forget about going to frats unless you are well connected or if you join/get into one in the spring. If your a pretty girl you will be fine. Otherwise you need to join a sorority or have connection and sorority rush is way more brutal then rushing a frat. \n\nThe school doesn\u2019t do much to address the social issues and a lot of student end up developing mental health issues.",

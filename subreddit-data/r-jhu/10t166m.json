    "postText": "See title -- I'm a BSPH graduate student. I've been hoping to go to a psychiatrist for a while now and thought I might be able to use my EHP insurance for it. Nothing too urgent, I've just had difficulties focusing for a really really long time now and have been putting it off. Tried navigating the counseling center's website, the EHP website, but I'm not really quite sure where to start. Would anyone know where I should call first?",

            "comment": "Personally, I\u2019d forgo the counseling center altogether and try your luck with finding a provider directly. I also have the Hopkins insurance which actually has fantastic coverage and I just go on psychologytoday.com. You can filter by who takes the hopkins insurance (Cigna) and go from there by cold calling a couple of providers to see if they are taking new clients. The only reason to go to the counseling center first imo is if you end up needing a referral to somewhere.",

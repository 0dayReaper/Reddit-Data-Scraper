    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m a working professional who just got accepted to APL\u2019s EP program, and I\u2019m looking to accept the offer. However hovering over the accept button pulls up a question asking about academic history.  In undergrad I was on academic probation freshman year and was involved with a massive homework cheating operation. This is all on paper at my undergrad university, and its stuff I learned from and have grown up since.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not sure what to mark down. I know APL isn\u2019t omnipotent (though I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find written records) and sometimes in life you gotta choose not to fuck yourself over a non-issue. However I\u2019d like to be honest where I can be. Personally I\u2019m annoyed they don\u2019t look into this before sending an offer. Part of me thinks they\u2019re just asking as an honesty check, the rest of me fully expects this kind of laziness from a large institution dealing with never ending stream of cash cow online degree applicants. \n\nAnyone else deal with a similar situation know how they answered this and what happened after? Again, I\u2019d like to be as honest as possible without tanking my application.",

If so, report it and add that you've learned and won't do it again (and that you've been upfront about it though you didn't need to be).\n\nIntegrity is a virtue because it lets you sleep well at night :)",

You\u2019re  asking us so you\u2019re questioning it yourself.\n\nJust to play devils advocate. If someone finds out and reports it, they can kick you out for answering that question dishonestly. If you answer honestly, you don\u2019t have to look over your shoulder constantly and worry about reliving a past mistake because you weren\u2019t honest. Before you mark it complete, contact someone in the program and tell them your situation, exceptions can always be made.",

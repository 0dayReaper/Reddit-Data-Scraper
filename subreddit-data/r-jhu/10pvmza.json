    "postText": "Helped my sibling order a transcript after recently finishing his program (graduate school in Engineering) in Fall 2022. He ordered an electronic PDF transcript on January 17th evening, specifying that he wanted the transcript as-is (on that date). It's been two weeks, and it is still stuck with the School of Arts &amp; Science. His other friends, have also not received theirs, and they ordered theirs at around the same time. At my own Alma Matter, electronic transcripts were typically sent in minutes, as opposed to weeks. He has no hold on his account.",

They take forever, sometimes 2-4 weeks, and I\u2019ve missed internship deadlines because of it. You can call the registrar and ask for it to be expedited. Hopefully that works out things for your sibling.",

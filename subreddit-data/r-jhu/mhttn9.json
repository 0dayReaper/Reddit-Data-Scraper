    "postText": "I've recently b**e**en seeing a bunch of posts here on reddit regarding the cutthroat culture of Johns Hopkins. Most people say we're just like a**n**y other university, but I'm here to tell you guys the truth. \n\nIt's extremely cutthroat. And this isn't even limited to academics.\n\nWhen I first came here, I was stopped by a band of roving BME ma**j**ors who demanded my J Card for lunch. They jeered and laughed at me until I was forced to give it up. N**o**t only did they buy lunch, they went to CharMar and bought like twent**y** strawberry milks. I was financially ruined for the rest of the semester.\n\nI was once talking to a neuroscience major and wished her good luck on a test. Next thing I know a band of kids calling themselves \"The Braniacs\" come up to me and warn me not to \"aid the enem**y**\". I thought it was a j**o**ke but then I found a severed goat head in front of my dorm door. \n\nHonestly, I'm even afraid of my fellow IS kids. I almost let slip that I was considering applying to SAIS later down the line. Some other chap made the same mistake a co**u**ple days ago and I haven't seen him since. I've heard rumo**r**s that they shipped him off to **A**ntarctica so he can \"get the experience he needs for his resume.\" \n\nThe last horror story of mine was when I was studying in B level. Out of nowhere some dude just comes u**p** to me and calls me an \"imposter\" or something. I was p**r**omptly kicked out of the library because I was \"acting sus\". I do some digg**i**ng and it turns out the **l**ibrarian was paid off by the a**f**orementioned Branaics, still reeling over my encouragement a few months ago. \n\n2025 students, unless you are forced to create a roving band of hool**i**gans on your own or have mountains of money to b**r**ibe librarians to kick out your competition, then I'm afraid John**s** Hopkins isn't the right fi**t** for you. Don't make the same mistake I've made.",

Your examples were especially creative; I particularly enjoyed the one about the Antarctic. \n    Special thanks for including librarians as villains! We don't often get to be the bad guys in literature.\n    Please meet the TA to help you work on smoothing out the writing, which is still somewhat choppy. I loathe choppy writing. A lot. Fix it, or expect to be chased by a Weasleys' Wildfire Whizbang -- now compatible with Zoom -- any time you try to use the library. Best wishes!",

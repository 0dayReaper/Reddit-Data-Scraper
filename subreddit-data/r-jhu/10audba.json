    "postText": "So I have been working in my current lab for 4 years, so my entire undergrad, and I graduated this past May. The lab hired me as a lab tech, but I am not really doing lab tech work. I am doing my own projects, teaching people techniques, etc. So I tried to get a position that more closely resembles these duties, like research specialist, but these positions required 1-4 years of experience. Now I thought that my undergrad experience would be sufficient, after all its in the same lab and everything. My PI had no issue with giving me the position but HR said no because my undergrad experience does not actually count because it was unpaid. Has anyone else dealt with this? If so how did you circumvent it? In my mind, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to be paid as a lab tech when I am doing what amounts to the work of a fellow (even HR themselves said it sounds like I am doing the same work as a fellow, but still declined my request)",

I'm being paid in a similar way a much higher wage than usual undergrad researchers, since I am contributed at a more fundamental level than data-entering and stuff",

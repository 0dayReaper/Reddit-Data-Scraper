    "postText": "Hey guys, I got accepted RD but I\u2019m not that familiar with how the whole market is in the US because there are so many great colleges lol.\n\nI just wanted to ask how well people are doing in general from the CS Major or CS + some kind of bio - especially in relation to the big tech companies (FAANG) and the top investment banks. Is it common to get these jobs, and does the JHU name help/open any doors.\n\nI\u2019m just worried because going there would be a big investment, so I\u2019d just want to make sure it pays off in the long run. \n\nSo if anyone could give some details about the kind of salaries/jobs the major gets people into that would be really useful for my decision.",

            "comment": "I can speak to CS + bio somewhat, since I was a CS premed. Even though I didn't put much dedication into the SWE job search (I'm in med school now), I had offers at Genentech (software development of bioinformatics platforms), Amazon, IBM. The JHU name (and the kind of learning you do &amp; opportunities you get at JHU) for sure open doors.\n\nAlmost all of my CS friends ended up somewhere fantastic; 1 at a top 10 med school, 1 at arguably the best PhD program for CS, and many many ppl at Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, IBM. One dude I kinda knew got one of those fancy quant trading jobs too\n\nSigned, \n\na very satisfied alum of JHU computer science",

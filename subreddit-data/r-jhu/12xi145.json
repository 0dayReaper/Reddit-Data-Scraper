    "postText": "I am an incoming international student searching for housing and have a few questions about Wyman Park Apartments. It would really help if someone could answer these questions!\n\nI asked the office for information about the apartment layout (where units and amenities are located in each floor) but they said that they don't have such specific information. I am an international student and cannot visit the place before moving in, so I am having kind of a hard time choosing a unit not knowing where things are located. Can someone give me a grasp of what the layout is? \n\nSome helpful information would be,\n\n1. How many trash rooms are located in each floor, and where they are located. I would prefer a unit that has some distance from the trash room.\n2. Where the elevators and stairs are located. I would also prefer a unit that is away from stairs and elevators.\n3. How the units are numbered. I guess the units will be ordered clockwise or counter-clockwise?  It would really help if I could identify the specific location of units in the 'I shaped' building.\n4. Where the package room and laundry room is located.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

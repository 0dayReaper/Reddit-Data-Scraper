    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman (and a pre-med), and I'm having a hard time choosing between these three majors. I'd like to double major between two of them if possible. I'm very very interested in all three, so I'm trying to pick the one(s) that I think would help the most for my own development and for maximizing outside opportunities. I'm kind of a science, math, and computer science person, so I figured that I'd like biophysics and the computational side of neuroscience (computational neursocience). I also figured that I could major in public health because I want to develop the non-science aspects of being a doctor.\n\nI just have a few questions-\n\n1. Is a double major between any two of these three majors doable? (Considering both scheduling classes and maintaining a good GPA)\n2. Might be a stupid question, but does majoring in Public Health give you cool medical opportunities? Please tell me if I'm totally wrong, but my understanding is that majoring in Biophysics and Neuroscience will give me unique research extracurricular opportunities, and majoring in Public Health could lead to cool internships that I otherwise would have a lesser chance at obtaining if I majored in something else.\n\nThanks for the help.",

            "comment": "Former neuro turned PHS senior here.  Can't speak to biophysics beyond that people seem to really enjoy it once they're in.  I know a few people graduating who doubled in neuro and PHS but most people end up dropping PHS by junior year because neuro is very time consuming.  I doubled for 1 semester before dropping neuro because I liked everything about PHS better.  You definitely don't need to pick right now (no one declares a major their first semester besides BME).  I would take Intro to Public Health and Fundamentals of Brain Behavior and Cognition (FBBC) in the fall as they will give you a decent sense of PHS and neuro.  \n\nIn terms of special opportunities, neuro guarantees research on your resume (it is a graduation requirement to do at least 6 credits) and the PHS applied experience is a great opportunity but it could literally be anything.  I wouldn't necessarily count on PHS for finding explicitly medical roles but our advisors are great at connecting students to opportunities in their field of interest, and having grad level coursework from the school of PH senior year is a plus.  Hope that helps and happy to chat :)",

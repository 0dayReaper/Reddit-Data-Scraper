            "comment": "It was alright. I personally felt it was similar to cell bio in difficulty. Exams are lecture-heavy and focus on the experiments covered in class. The textbook is really great for clearing up confusion, but you don't necessarily need it to do well. If you pay attention and try to really understand the homework, you'll do fine. The backtests are a must-do! So many questions/concepts are repeated from the backtests to the actual test. If I slacked off big time my senior year and was still able to do well, I'm sure you'll be fine too!",

If you did, they would be provided - usually on the shelf above the bench, close to the pipettes.\n\nAnyway, my friends who\u2019ve taken it disagree that it\u2019s hard. You\u2019ve taken all the other bio classes, so you\u2019re probably fine.",

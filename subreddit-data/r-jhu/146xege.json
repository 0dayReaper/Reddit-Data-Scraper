Hopkins chose u because they felt u were capable of succeeding here",

It felt like they were way ahead of me (coming from public school in the Midwest). The thing with college is there are people that excel at high school that struggle in college, and there are people who find their rhythm in college when maybe they struggled before. \n\nJust work hard, give it your all, and you\u2019ll be okay. It doesn\u2019t matter how you got there. Literally NONE of that matters now that you\u2019re there. This is your chance to start a new path.",

But at the same time, I know I got to where I am because I worked my ass off during my  undergrad years (and even my high school years), and it\u2019s totally normal to feel imposter syndrome when you\u2019re surrounded by some of the brightest people in the world. The fact that you got accepted means the admissions office saw potential in you \u2014 not by some pure chance. Embrace the dub, keep your chin up, and keep up the grind. You can achieve whatever goal you want. Congrats and good luck!",

When you\u2019re here and see people doing better than yourself remember that if you\u2019re smartest in the room, you\u2019re in the wrong place. Also, there will be times when you\u2019ll be the smarter one, professors, your friends and classmates will be awed by your responses and curiosity. Accept praise in those moments. Say thank you and appreciate being seen. It will be your moment and in that moment when you feel unsure of yourself, understand that most of us feel unsure and we learn as we live. You\u2019re good enough and your productivity does not equal your worth. Your studies and courses don\u2019t define you but they should only define the topics you\u2019re curious about (or their prereqs haha).  Hope you\u2019ve an amazing time learning about the things you\u2019re passionate about at Hopkins. See you around in Fall!",

You can really nail down a concept with good one on one teaching from a professor. Just keep up the good work ethic that got you here and you\u2019ll do okay.",

Besides, sooo many ppl get in either ED1 or ED2. Imposter syndrome is normal and understandable but it can affect you regardless of what position you're in and chances are a lot of ppl are going to experience it at some point either way. My advice would be to try not to get hung up on these things and look forward instead of dwelling on things that we honestly can never  have any real answers to :)",

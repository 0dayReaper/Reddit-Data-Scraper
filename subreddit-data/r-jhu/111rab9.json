    "postText": "I'm  looking for someone to sublease my apartment from mid-May to the end of  August (no renewal). The apartment is across the street from AMR II  (next to the University Baptist Church) and a short walk to all  buildings on the Homewood campus, so it is perfect for a Homewood  student. It is furnished with a queen size bed, a microwave, a fridge,  kitchen utensils, and a window AC unit (not shown in the picture). A  washing machine and dryer are available in the building.  \nThe  rent for this studio is $750/mo with all utilities included. The rent  is negotiable if you want to stay for the entire summer. Please DM me if  you're interested.",

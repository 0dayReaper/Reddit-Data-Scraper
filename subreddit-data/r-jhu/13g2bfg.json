You enroll in classes, contact the school's veterans office who certifies your enrollment in classes to VA. VA pays the required/authorized tuition/fees to the school and pays you the book/supply stipend based on the number of credit hours enrolled and pays you the Monthly Housing Allowance authorized based on the Rate of Pursuit (full time or part time) and the format the classes are take in.\n\nYou need one in-person class that meets for the full length of the semester to be paid the MHA based on the campus zip code. You must be enrolled at Greater than 1/2 time to be paid any MHA.\n\nBook/Supply stipend is paid at $41.67 per credit hour enrolled for each term up to $1000 per academic term.",

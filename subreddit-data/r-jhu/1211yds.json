            "comment": "For most classes, you'll have lectures to watch each week, I'd estimate between 1 and 2.5 hrs depending on the class. Weekly assignments are pretty common, sometimes alongside an open book online quiz and/or discussion board posts. Many of the core classes and some electives have group projects  associated with them, workload on those varies, there's generally a few sets of group deliverables over the course of the semester. \n\nAssuming you dont work a ridiculous number of hours, you can certainly work full time and double up classes. You'll be busy towards the end of the semester, but it's doable. \n\nHope that helps!",

The more time demanding core classes will be FESS I and FESS II, so try to find a lighter load to pair with those courses. I would recommend Electro Optics or Spacecraft Hardware Design, which are both interesting but also easier to manage from a workload perspective.\n\nThe previous comment is very accurate. I would add that I only took one course that actually had exams (Space Weather). \n\nIt\u2019s a fun program and I enjoyed my time!",

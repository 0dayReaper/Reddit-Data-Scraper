(Meaning that everyone who applied to medical school in the biophysics major got into at least one).\n\nBut take that with a grain of salt. Biophysics is actually a really hard major and the people who are in it just tend to be very hardworking so that they get into medical school, not that doing biophysics actually helps with med school admissions. Biophysics seems to have some pretty hard classes, like Protein Engineering and Biochemistry Lab. You will have a much harder time than someone just doing biology or public health, but if you are passionate about biophysics, then it can be the best choice.",

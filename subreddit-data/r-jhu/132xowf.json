    "postText": "I was admitted to the Whiting School of Engineering for Computer Science and was wondering whether or not I can do the premed track even in the School of Engineering. I saw some online sites that said that students in the Krieger School of Arts &amp; Sciences don't declare a major until the the spring of freshman year. How does it work for the Whiting School of Engineering? If anyone has information about this, I would appreciate it.",

Plus, CS plus some chem / bio / medicine positions you well for some other great careers, if you don\u2019t ultimately want to go to med school, eg bioinformatics, medical robotics (which JHU is exceptional at)",

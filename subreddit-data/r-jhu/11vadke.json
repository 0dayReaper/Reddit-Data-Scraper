    "postText": "Hi all! I am an incoming public health grad student and am debating whether or not to live in 929 apartment. Recent searches have revealed many negative reviews about this apartment, which makes me hesitant. Is it better to live in 929, or is it better to live farther to commute? My main concern is the safety aspect. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations?",

            "comment": "I've heard it's really hit or miss. When I was touring 929 (even after reading the laughably horrendous reviews), I wasn't impressed. Pretty overpriced for what you get imo. A few of my friends have lived there and they've had A/C outages during the summer in addition to power outages during online exams. Personally I think you'd be able to get more of your money's worth in a place like Upper Fells which is still close to Hopkins. \n\nMt. Vernon is also another popular choice but at least from my experience it seems to be slightly sketchier at night but again, I'm sure others may tell you different just based on their own experiences",

I go to BSPH too but I live in Charles Village.   \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd probably try to look for a rowhome in Charles Village (which costs like 1000-1300 for a studio/1 bd; 1500ish for a 2 bd) or live in Mt Vernon. Your walk time might even be less, the JHMI bus drops me right in front of the Hopkins Hospital. Also, Mt Vernon is fine especially right by Charles / St. Paul. But I do prefer Charles Village by Homewood, it has a neighborhood feel to it.",

    "postText": "Hi, I get into the masters program in CS (NLP) and have a few questions regarding the department/university. \n\n1. How does living in Baltimore feel? Is it dangerous at night?\n2. What's the department like? My current university has a huge undergrad crowd but the masters program is highly selective. Do grad students at JHU generally have TAship/can get in touch with faculties easily?\n3. I assume the matching process starts in the second semester? Are there exceptions? If I have previous research experience would it be possible to begin early?\n4. What do you like/hate most about JHU?",

That said, here are my Hopkins cons: \n\n1. This is NOT a party school. We have frats/sororities, but compared to most other schools they are pretty small. Most people don't go to their parties or participate in Greek life. That said, there are thousands of undergrads, so even with a low level of overall participation there are still frat parties every weekend. I personally have no interest in Greek life so honestly this is barely a con for me. \n\n2. Classes are generally pretty difficult and have large workloads. How hard each course is obviously varies quite a bit, but in 2 years here I've only had 2 classes that I would describe as easy. The premed requirements are famously taxing and weed out quite a few students before the first year is through. Even with PILOT (a course-specific program with review sessions) and the course resources, it is a top 10 school for a reason. The good news is that everyone knows how challenging JHU is, which is why a degree from here is an incredible asset. Most importantly, you are going to learn a lot in the process. \n\n3. The food is, for lack of a better word, mid. The dining halls, Nolan's and FFC/Hopkins Caf\u00e9, are pretty much hit or miss: some days it's great (i.e. egg roll day) and others you wish you never left your room. I once ate boiled eggplant and farro for dinner. That's all there was. However, the places on campus that you can use dining dollars at are reliably good. Anything you get at Charles Street Market or Levering is at least decent, and there are some things there I like a lot. Levering is a food hall with a bunch of different cuisine options so you can definitely find many things you'll like. I opted out of the meal plan this year because I want to save money, and honestly I don't miss it. It's not intolerable, though - I've seen much worse.\n\n*Edit: I only had a meal plan during the second COVID year, and everything was kind of chaotic back then. I think the food has gotten better as things have returned to normalcy.\n\n4. The mental health services specifically are very underwhelming. I personally have never accessed these resources, but my girlfriend and several friends have told me that it was a waste of time. They provide you with counseling, but after like 2 sessions they just tell you to get a therapist. The crisis support is effective at stopping anyone from hurting themselves, if they call, but beyond that they aren't well-equipped to make you feel better. Student health services and support for those affected by gender-based violence are much better, thankfully. \n\nI think those are my only major qualms with JHU. Everything else is either acceptable or outstanding - mostly outstanding, though. Dorms are mid in freshman year but there are sophomore dorms that are genuinely excellent. Feel free to ask anything specific you're wondering about, though!",

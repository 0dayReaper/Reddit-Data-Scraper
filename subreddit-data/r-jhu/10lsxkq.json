It depends on your friend group, but if you want to go out and hang every night it's not hard to do. There's generally bigger parties every weekend.\n\nFWIW renting an entire row house near campus is not too expensive.",

There\u2019s almost always at least one fraternity throwing every weekend. \nThere are also plenty of clubs/bars downtown (Powerplant, fells point, fed hill) and a decent strip of bars up in Towson. Obviously, you would need to be 21+ or have a fake ID for these places, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue for underclassmen.\n\nYes there is a big emphasis on academics, but you can absolutely balance work and partying. At the height of my degeneracy my friends and I would go out every Thursday/Friday/Saturday and still do well in our classes.\n\nFeel free to DM me with any further questions. Don\u2019t worry about whether or not you\u2019ll be able to party at Hopkins \u2014 if you want to, you\u2019ll be able to.",

            "comment": "The real answer to this depends on your personal prefs for matsci.\n\nBiomaterials under Mao is elite, but I am biased since I ultimately went into biomaterials related research. The class name speaks for itself, but it\u2019s a good base of knowledge for understanding polymers and how they are used/interact with biological environments.\n\nStructure was taught by a different prof when I took it a million years ago. However it is not my cup of tea when it comes to matsci. It\u2019s much more statics and mechanics type of content, mixed with how atoms and such are arranged within materials. It\u2019s very classic feeling materials science.",

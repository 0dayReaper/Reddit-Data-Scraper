She\u2019s a bit of a slow reader, but a good lecturer, and very knowledgeable - she\u2019ll have an answer for every question. She\u2019s a big fan of nuance. If you\u2019re more stem oriented and haven\u2019t taken anthropology courses before, be prepared for it to be more like philosophy and sociology than like \u201ca history of humans\u201d or a hard science.",

I\u2019m not sure how contingent that was on her liking my ideas, but I imagine she\u2019s one of the types who acts like a hard grader but actually gives everyone As.",

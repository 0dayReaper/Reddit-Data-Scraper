I\u2019m fortunate enough that my parents can pay for me to stay over the summer so I can continue working in my lab, but I was really hoping to get paid so my parents wouldn\u2019t have to bear the extra costs. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts/advice?",

Programs like DURA/PURA, BPD, and even post-grad jobs are flush with strong applicants, so you will face a lot of rejection and it can help emotionally if you try not to take it personally. \n\nI\u2019d consider getting another part-time, paid job over the summer that you can do when you\u2019re not working in lab. That way, even if your parents help with a portion of your costs over the summer, you\u2019ll also be able to cover part of your own expenses.",

It definitely helped me gain experience and probably helped me get paid research positions in subsequent summers. It\u2019s difficult to get experience when you start out so, if your parents are able to bear the costs, in my experience it\u2019s worth it",

            "comment": "Moping over getting rejected won\u2019t help you, as tempting as it probably is. Consider this a learning experience rather than a failure; getting rejections is just the cost of pursuing most things, and every rejection brings you closer to your first acceptance.\n\nBeing financially able to spend the summer doing unpaid research is a gift lots of your peers don\u2019t have, so use this time to your advantage. Be the best you can be in your lab and spend free time networking with relevant professors / grad students so you can build relationships for future research / academic opps. Put yourself in the best possible position to get the grant next time. \n\nAlso if you\u2019re really feeling bad about the money, get a part time job to help cover costs! If you don\u2019t have summer classes / coursework and aren\u2019t working full time in the lab you should have plenty of time to pick up shifts somewhere.\n\nAnd, as someone who spent two of my hop summers in Baltimore, I def recommend you take advantage of the extra time in the city and explore. There\u2019s a lot of great bars, restaurants, music venues, shops, etc that most Hop kids never experience just a short ride away on the JHMI or Circulator!",

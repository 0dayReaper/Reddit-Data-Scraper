Take a couple days to work on things and submit the best possible portfolio you can. \n\nEven if they aren't picky, do it for your own sake. Assuming you get in, any experience you have will help.

That said, every bit of practice you can get will be worth it if you come here.\n\nI would advise you not to come here, though. You'll get a fine education, yes, but the cost is far too great. Not just monetarily, but psychologically. Almost every artist I know here has had issues with the crippling amount of work and stress the degree forces on you, and from what I've heard, depression and other similar issues run pretty rampant as a result.

Considering you take 20 per semester, that is 80 hours per week. BFAs are the hardest worked of all the degrees IMO, so I'd say it will be just as much for you. I do not know any BFAs with outside jobs, but anything more than a light part time gig is basically going to be impossible, and even that would be more than I'd recommend. DigiPen itself also recommends that you do not work while here. ",

Most of the ones that did had jobs that were part time gigs. But, I am aware of a single BFA that did have a full-time job(must have been super flexible for classes or something). \n\nI graduated a few years ago, but I've only heard upheaval with the art program(Could be in a better state now though). With that said, I've also heard mixed responses on employment. (Directly into an art-focused job that is). It's a very competitive industry and you have to be willing to do things that you might have not considered previously. (When I say that I mean like, if you prefer 3D art, you may someday have to take a job that is predominantly UI or some other art focus).\n\nJust be aware of that and have an open mind.\n\nI would also parrot what the other poster has said and strongly consider other options if you can as it is quite expensive to attend this school.",

You want to do 3d modeling, computer graphics, or what have you? Too bad, draw with pen and paper for two years, then you can. I can't personally judge if this is good or bad for one's art, but I know some of my friends are pretty bothered by it.",

BAGD is kinda iffy because I know a lot of BAGDs who will go on to be super awesome designers, but I feel like most of those people would do just as well as a BSGD and be better at CS, or at another school and save a lot of money. The shift from BAGD&gt;BAID I think is a step in the right direction, but obviously nobody knows how that will work out long term.\n\nAs far as other degrees, I don't know nearly enough about them to judge.

You also don't get credit for working with game teams except a couple courses I believe which is appalling.

It says they score on the essays not on the quality of the work, but I find this can't be completely true? If anyone has any helpful info that would be great! Thanks! ",

            "comment": "Hey! Current Sophomore here.\n\nThis is the first year that the design portfolio is required for BAGDs, so I can only comment on what I'd expect from DigiPen in general.\n\nI do not thing they are looking for quality of Game Design work - they aren't expecting you to have good Game Design skills, actually they are expecting the opposite.\n\nWhat they are looking for is if you have the aptitude to LEARN Game Design. This is done through the fact that you\n\nA) have done design work before\n\nand \n\nB) that you can write a descriptive essay on your design process.\n\nIt's less about the game design being employed and more about judging whether or not you want to actually design games.\n\nThe BAGD program is infamous for being the go-to degree for people who think \"Playing Games is fun, game design must be easy! I'm going to make games!\" - the design portfolio is an attempt at limited the number of people like that.\n\nTL;DR - I can say for sure, but no, it's probably not about quality of work but about whether or not you truly have an aptitude and passion for Game Design.\n\n",

            "comment": "Based on my experience, you can make a really, really shitty game (not half assed, just bad) and just state what your intentions are for it. After that, document actual, physical playtesting of your game with other people, preferably different each time. You can tell them how to play but don't help too much (ideally you would have written a rule book and make them figure it out but that's not necessary for early prototypes). Go for 3 plays minimum. Document each one, make minor adjustments between each play and document those and why you think the chances are necessary.\n\nOnce the playtesting is all done, you'd basically write what went right, what went wrong, what you learned during the process and stuff like that. I don't know anything about their portfolio but this is basically the essence of what it is to take the board game design classes, which is the first thing you will do in game design. Whether you only need to have made prototype IDK, but you can just stick to paper prototypes of games. They will probably see that as having more potential than someone who just makes an untested video game prototype, since they really beat it into you that you are going to have to learn board game design before doing much video game design.",

                            "comment": "One of my professors told us to make one vs one scenarios specifically. Don't try to do PvE or 3+ free for all board games. You can make a 4 player board game if its 2v2 (basically anything that has 2 entities going against each other).\n\nThe reasoning for this was because once you get into 3 or more teams, the game now has an element of, \"how can I make the other players attack this player so I can gain an advantage later?\" and other psychological elements that you may not directly be able to design for. It just gets too complicated when the goal in these classes is to learn the basics.\n\nAsymmetric design on the other hand is fine, for example, a board game where one player defends and the other attacks. Things don't have to be perfectly balanced and both player's don't need a 50% chance of winning, so don't worry too much about that.\n\nSome other basic things: \n\n* Don't blame players for any potential flaws in your game unless you have strong evidence. (If a person admits they hate shooters and are terrible at shooters, and your game is a shooter, you can take their feedback with a grain of salt. You may not want to make your shooter better for people who hate shooters at the expense of people who like them.)\n* Don't assume anything will work or wont work without testing (speculating is fine).\n* Don't let on that playtesting your game is too hard or time consuming for you during essays (even if it is).\n* Don't be hard on yourself for designing something poorly. If you can tell it's bad you have the power to fix it which is a step in the right direction.\n* Know that trying something really unique will likely lead to failure and you will watch as your game becomes more and more like other games as you try to get it to work and that's perfectly fine.\n\u2022Avoid trying (very) new things when you are also learning. IE, don't plan to make a game revolving around random terrain generation when you have never made random terrain generation before. ",

Based on my conversations with the professor who wrote these new requirements, I think the description in the portfolio is being quite honest.\n\nIf you want to be a game designer, then you have probably made some things. If not, get on that, I guess. All he's looking for is interest in the creative process and the ability to make informed choices during said process. He'll get you through the rest when you hear his lectures.\n\nGood luck, feel free to PM me for digipen tips and tricks.",

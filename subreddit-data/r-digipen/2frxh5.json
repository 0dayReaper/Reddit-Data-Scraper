I don't know much about the masters degree for that program, but I can only imagine that it's similar in nature.\n\nGame design can be difficult to get into due to the amount of people that wish to do it and due to the limited number of designers that are on any given project.\n\nEven if you wanted to be a designer, having a deep understanding of programming never hurts and I know more than a few BSCSRTIS graduates that have transitioned to design or even started their game industry careers in design.\n\nCareer possibilities right out the gate:\n\nBSGD:\nlevel designer, technical designer, gameplay programmer, content designer, and UI programmer.\n\nBSCSRTIS:\ngameplay programmer, systems programmer, tools programmer, graphics programmer, AI programmer, Pretty much any kind of programmer really.\n\nCE:\nI really don't know about all the possibilities here. I'm sure there are.\n\nIt sounds like you already have a programming degree, but I would warn that DigiPen is very much a \"you get what you put in\" kind of place. DigiPen kinda just throws you into the deep end and expects you to be able to swim in some respects(keyword here is \"some\" as they do teach many things as if you knew nothing about them). That's at least for the BSCSRTIS and BSGD degree. I don't know too much about the others.\n\nI am a BSGD graduate and I am a designer in the industry but have definitely had a rough start. Been through multiple layoffs and done test gigs to span the interim between design jobs. But I know others who have had the same job since they entered the industry. \n\nWhich essentially means that it's good to research the company you're going to work for and make sure it's stable if you can.\n\nHope this helps!",

                            "comment": "BSGD does the bare minimum of art. What you can create, unless you have a talent in the arts, is placeholder assets. Good enough to get the point across but not something you would want the game to ship with. you learn almost nothing about 3D modeling as well(you take one class for it). Might have changed since I was there though. BSGD is typically more focused on the technical side of design(plenty of level design jobs on that end as well though).\n\nEach studio usually has a slider spanning from programmer to artist of what they think a designer is. Some think they should be able to create art assets while others want a designer that can do some programming when needed. Though if you can successfully do both at a high quality thats awesome.\n\nSo yes, if you're wanting to be able to develop your own art assets while designing a level, it would be best to seek more art electives if you're going to pursue the BSGD degree.\n\nThough, I will also say that programming is no less of a key skill to have for level designers. Things can go in the opposite direction where a studio may want a level designer to be able to setup all the events that are in the level that she is creating.\n\nEach company that I have worked for has had a different level design workflow as well. One had it where the artist would create some concept art, designers create a level to incorporate that and then the artists go back in and adjust to fit a mood that the level is going for.\n\nAnother was where some artists would generate decoration assets while others would create the actual level portions and then the designers would jump in and add events to that level portion.\n\nEven another was where the artists make the assets that go into the level and the designers put all that stuff together. Each had its ups and downs and each workflow, to some extent, was very much due to the type of game that was being worked on.\n\nSo yeah, to some degree, each studio you go to will probably have a slightly different level design workflow. Keep in mind that I did simplify a bit of those workflows just to draw a general picture of each of them.\n\nEvery job that I have had as a designer usually has me doing a bit of everything when it comes to design from systems design to level design. Bigger studios are more specific on what they want you to do, but it's good to dabble in everything so you have a sense of what you like best.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIt's best if you just know everything!\n\nIn all seriousness it's good to just have real life experiences. You'll draw on that more often than not when you're designing things.\n",

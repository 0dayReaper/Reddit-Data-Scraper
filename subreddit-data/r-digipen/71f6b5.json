You get one for your cohort and one for your major right off the bat. Others you can get are the SAVE scale, which you get for attending events during SAVE week; Spirit Scale, which you get during Spirit week of spring semester each year; Ambassador Scale for being a student ambassador and gaining enough points there; Involvement Scale, which you get for attending a certain number of clubs and campus events (there's sign-in sheets for this purpose); Dean's List Scale, which you get for making the Dean's List (I believe it's a GPA greater than 3.5 but I'm not totally sure about that); Housing Scale, which you get for attending a certain number of housing events, again I'm not sure how many.\n\nThat's all the scales I know off the top of my head but I'm sure there's more, and you almost always get them from the Dragon's Lair on the 2nd floor",

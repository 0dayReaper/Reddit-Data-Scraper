            "comment": "Firstly, the complaint saying you have to make a game engine from scratch in GAM 100 is total bullshit. This is the sequence for GAM courses:\n\nGAM 100 - You are taught how to do basic things in a provided C based text adventure engine. After a few weeks you are split into teams and make your own text based game using the same provided framework. \n\nGAM 150 - You are taught how to do basic things in a provided C based 2D game engine. You are split into teams and make your own 2D game. It doesn't have to be ambitious, so long as it runs and resembles a game you'll pass.\n\nGAM 200/250 (sophomore year) - You are split into teams and make a 2D game in a custom engine made from scratch. At this point you've taken a year's worth of programming courses, including the game engine architecture course.\n\nGAM 300/350 (junior year) - You make a 3D game. You can make a custom engine or use Unreal, Unity, or just about any engine you want.\n\nGAM 400/450 (senior year) - You make a thing (game, tech demo, whatever) and write a research paper about it along the way.\n\nFor design students I think their version of GAM 100/150 is slightly different in that they are given something like Unity or Zero Engine to work with from the get go since their degree is less programming focused.\n\nAs for the course load. It is definitely a lot of work (19-21 credits a semester is no joke). I'm in my 6th and final year at DigiPen going for an RTIS degree, but that is mostly because calculus is fucking hard for me and I've had to retake a couple math classes and a physics class because I'm just bad at calculus. \n\nWill you crunch at DigiPen? Yes. Will you crunch at just about any other big college or university? Yes. The hardest part is time management. The GAM courses at DigiPen are endless time sinks. You can make any game you wish and inevitably *will* overscope your project at some point. Overworking yourself trying to make it the best game it can be. It is hard to do time management properly when something in your schedule is a black hole that sucks up as much time as you can possibly give it. \n\nAs for the professor mentioned in the video who yelled at a blind student, I have no idea who they are talking about and have never seen or heard of anything even remotely like that at DigiPen. That sounds like an extreme one off case and after this video released DigiPen sent out an email to everyone reminding them that if you have any issues to contact blah blah blah... DigiPen is an extremely inclusive school and takes shit like that very seriously.\n\nThe only time I saw a student get upset and complain that the teacher hadn't taught us something that was on the homework, that student was an idiot who simply didn't pay attention, because the physics professor absolutely covered that material. And when the professor was shouted at by this student in front of the whole class, the professor handled it elegantly and professionally, trying his best to work with the student for a solution. All the professors I've personally met at DigiPen have been wonderful and the one exception to that is no longer at DigiPen.\n\nFrom what I could glean from the complaints in the video, a lot of them seemed to come from design students. From what I hear there is one design professor that kind of has a nightmare grading policy (which is likely where the 128% to get an A part comes from), but aside from that I haven't heard anything like whats stated in the video and the quotes honestly sound exaggerated or out of context. But again, I haven't taken any design classes or met the professors of those classes. All I can speak for is the classes I've taken as a BSCS RTIS major. \n\nAnd as for some of the professors industry knowledge being outdated... that is kind of irrelevant. Their stories from their old days working at such-n-such incorporated are fun to hear but don't really have any impact on our education so I'm a little confused every time this is brought up as if its a bad thing. Are these people saying it would be better to be taught by someone at another university with zero industry experience instead?\n\nTL:DR, Most of the non-crunch related complaints in this video haven't been my experience at all and after speaking with a bunch of my fellow students after this video came out, it hasn't been any of theirs either (including design students). As for the crunch culture at DigiPen, a lot of that comes down to time management with respect to your GAM courses since they can easily suck up all of your time if you let them.",

                    "comment": "Just a note, but the GAM 100/150 courses have changed. Freshmen CS in GAM100 this year had to implement a game in the custom C framework provided by faculty. We had a few weeks to be eased into it, but then that left only 6 or so weeks of actual development. That said, expectations were incredibly low from the faculty, and basically as long as what you turned in was something interactive, you passed.\n\nEDIT: also, i should note. the professor on two occasions said the GAM class wasn't our priority, and if we had other classes we were struggling in we should work on those. \n\nAlso, not sure if this is new or not, but the course is pass/fail, and doesn't count towards GPA from what i understand. Not sure if the other GAM courses are doing similar.\n\nThe design course i've taken had grades delayed by almost a month or two, with half of my assignments getting graded in the last week of class. I never worried about my grade, but in retrospect i had no idea if i was passing or not. Class was sparse on useful skills, unless you were someone who had never critically thought about game design before.\n\nOtherwise this is spot on. I've been through another university prior to this, and it seems like the faculty are far more interested in making sure students succeed than any other place i've been. From financial aid to the professors, i've seen them basically over backwards to make things easier for me. COVID might have something to do with it, imo.",

That would lessen a lot of stress off students. The quality of games would probably suffer but the students would suffer less since they don't have to worry about perfection.",

At least now.\n\nMy experience with the redacted name design professor was pretty much similar to the video.\n\nAlso, on crunch: you can definitely get away with not working so hard when you're in your junior year and forward, but for underclassmen it's a lot.\n\nEDIT: Also, on the instructors not having a lot of current industry experience? That's a HUGE deal. Especially for GAM students who are told to dress professional, walk professional, stand the same way, etc. during milestone presentations. That's simply not true anymore.\n\nIf I come to a game design school, I'm looking for up to date experience and information. Not 2000s information. It's the reason I'm paying for this.\n\nTL;DR: As a design student a lot of it rings true, the problem teachers have been fired (besides one) and crunch is easy to get around if you're an upperclassmen. GAM courses have out of date information on the industry which you have to abide by those rules which sucks",

This rings pretty true. \n\nI ended up getting a job at a first party Sony studio.  The studio hired grads out of digipen as contract work pretty regularly. They were the \u2018first real industry job\u2019 for a lot of people. \n\nSome, like me, ended up hired salary and stayed there for years. Others just used it as a stepping stone for going somewhere else after their contract ended. \n\nSo I can also say that graduating from Digipen did mean something, as far as getting an industry job was concerned. \n\nDoes Digipen teach Crunch Culture?  Absolutely.  At least, it did when I went there.  \n\nIs the video games industry overrun with crunch culture?  Absolutely. \n\nSo does Digipen \u2018prepare you for the reality of the games industry as it currently stands\u2019?  Yeah?  Probably.  \n\nIs it okay that crunch culture is so prevalent?  Probably not. \n\nDoes being \u2018not okay\u2019 change the fact that that\u2019s the way things currently are?  Nope. \n\n\nI left the games industry because I became a mom, and daycares close at 6pm.  I brought my toddler to play under my desk at work more times than I can remember, because I was needed to be at work after 6pm.  \n\nThey\u2019d bring in catered food at 8pm. Few people left before 10pm. \n\nMy husband was also in the games industry.  We had two kids. One of us needed to be able to go home at night.

            "comment": "Hello, I can't give an accurate depiction as things stand now but I can describe what rings true from when I attended from 2008 to 2012.\n\n1. There were many teachers who either never worked in the industry or who's experience in the industry was dated.\n   1. Typically though the teachers who had never worked in the industry were the programming teachers or general education teachers (math, english, etc.).\n2. You will definitely work your ass off at DigiPen. I've heard they have attempted to improve that aspect of it though I don't know if it has gotten any better. I personally went to school at 8am and stayed till they closed as semesters picked up in workload and the GAM classes picked up.\n\nWhat I never experienced was whoever this teacher is that sounds like a complete jackass. I've heard some of the classes were built to weed people out. I never really experienced that but it's possible that wasn't put in place until after I left.\n\nThis likely isn't a terribly good thing to say either but having graduated from DigiPen I never ran into a situation where I felt I was overworked or felt like I dealt with anything more difficult than DigiPen.\n\nAs for a worthwhile school? If you make it through DigiPen you will have a fairly good chance of getting a job in the industry. Particularly if you go with a programming degree.\n\nDesign is harder simply due to the reduced number of designers companies are looking for and art is difficult because of the desired skills companies are looking for. Though, for art, it depends on where you want to work and your level of skill.\n\nAll in all though, I think you can get into the industry by attending a state school and pursuing a programming degree. There are design degrees at some state schools too that could be much cheaper than DigiPen like UofU (once you become a resident of Utah).\n\nOr, you can attempt to learn things on your own. There are tons of resources online on how to make games. Just takes the motivation to keep on it and teach yourself stuff (which is super hard, I know, I went to DigiPen because I knew I didn't have that kind of motivation).\n\nHope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions. I assume more recent grads or attending students may reply here.",

            "comment": "I'm a BSGD who graduated from Digipen in 2018. I will try to list all my thoughts on different topics from my own personal experience, and will also try to stay as neutral as possible. Will only address crunch issues, since it's the only issue I've experienced beside grading. (will be quite a bit of replies)\n\nOne thing to note is to take the complaints or personal experiences with a grain of salt. Many experiences can be personal, different for each degree program, and not all of them have experienced the same issues, especially the crunches issues, I know many BFAs that have a lot of free time and get A in most core classes (but some BFA also said that they have workload issues). I personally graduated from BSGD in 2018, I am biased, but I think it is the worst in terms of workload (both GAM and GAT courses are time sink, unlimited work. But many RTIS would say that they have it worse, so yea back to the first sentence.). I have experience a lot of crunches, it was nothing but work and physical/mental health issues, but it's also hard to put full blame on Digipen since most of the crunches were tied to your own project's scopes (we were always shown some good/successful Digipen projects that will be showcase at PAX, so rarely anyone want to compromise on scopes).\n\nAlso noted that there are a lot of ppl dropped out from Digipen that really resent, hold grudges, and may not depict a completely fair picture. Like any game school, in Freshman year, there will always be many students thinking that they will be playing a lot of games and just have fun, when things turn out to be the opposite, most of them dropped out (that's why many ppl wouldn't think of Freshmen dropout's opinion very highly). Also just like any CS degree programs, there will also be students that realized programming isn't for them, and dropped out. I'm not saying that what they claimed aren't valid, I can definitely see some of those claims being true especially normalising crunches one (whether intentional or not, Digipen environment/peers definitely encourage students to work all the time, which has obvious pros and cons).",

In my opinion, Digipen offers a decently good physical environment that promotes growth and allows students to put in the work (no distraction in Redmond, and everyone is always working, strong peer learning/competition). Which also results in students overwork themselves, normalising crunches, a lot of mental breakdown from pure workload driven by passion (workload that you put it upon yourself by your project's scope). Suffice to say that a lot of the students ended up burning out even before starting working full-time. But a handful of those who survived also will be able to handle anything and become really strong self-independent juniors in any organization.\n\nAlso it's important to note that, even with a lot of side effects, the crunch mentality in Digipen definitely works really well in producing high quality graduates (I'm biased, but everyone I met who knows Digipen grads always says positive things, even those I talk to during interviews).\n\nThere is also an interesting camaraderie among many graduated students. After I graduated I made several friends in a company who graduated from Digipen within 2-10 years apart. Somehow we can feel the friendship and we all empathize with each other a lot. It's like we went through the same war of mental/emotional pain together (even with 10 years apart), in some sense, that is a pros I guess.",

Also it seems to not be uncommon to see ppl having mental breakdown, and very depressed considering how small Digipen's student population is (high percentage).\n\nThis is my BSGD experience: very tired all the time, there's always a deadline every 2-3 days (so you'll always crunch), no mental breakdown but I felt pretty much dead inside (very numb), all I can think of was that I wanted to sleep. This feeling lasts every single moment for every semester (you get some break during summer and winter, but there will always be GAM and GAT every semester).\n\nBSGD has the lowest graduation rate, probably due to sheer amount of workload and students being stretched too thin onto both CS and design, both are really hard and demand a lot of time (the most precious resource you can allocate to determine which class to pass/fail). After graduating, many BSGD have issues identifying their career goal as engineer or designer making it harder to find a job (many companies want specialists that do one thing really well, meaning half of your work means nothing). During the semester, the workload is insane, you'll always be playing catch up all the time, unlimit amount of work (GAM + GAT + other courses + test/exam). Note that Digipen is a 5 years program crammed into 4 years (due to parents complaining about the tuition fees), so the sheer workload alone without game projects should be enough to overwhelm you.\n\nThroughout the years, I was very tired and stressed, and even with all that work, struggling to land a single job intensifies the stress (skills to land a job may be quite different especially CS Leetcoding). Being international student is also a HARD mode, can't easily do internship, unless landing it at specifics time in the year (I landed internship for one of the company in silicon valley, but can't do it because they said I was getting offer too late, even though it was before the semester start). Also international students get visa invalidated and kick out of USA if you don't land any job within 3 months after graduated and when you mentioned \"visa\", most company will ghost you, that really intensify the stress.",

For BSGD, there are GAM and GAT projects that have an unlimited amount of workload (depending on your project's scope). I was always working at the school's workspace from morning to 12 am (until close), 6-7 days a week, it was a never-ending task. At the time, I always pondered to myself, \"why I'm I doing this to myself, nothing I do will even matter. No one will play it, even if they do, they will shit on it\". It was always a depressive thought in my head, but there's nothing else I could do but to keep going.\n\nI think many ppl already say a lot about GAM and it's pretty clear how time sink it can be, GAT is just as much time sink in my experience. Your mileage may vary, but unless your GAT project is super simple (if you can accept that it will look dull on your portfolio), there's no way to finish it without crunch. GAT project is all about prototyping game to deliver certain engagement goals, which will involved a lot of designs choices, prototype/programming, playtest (find player to get feedback), reiterate on designs, and repeat until your project is good enough (acknowledged by professor's opinion, you will know your grade after each feedback, so you'll always keep working until you're satisfied). The expected next iteration time frequency is like 2 times a week (4-7 weeks per project, 2-3 projects per semester), while all the GAM and other course workloads are going on. You just can't stop working, throughout the whole semester, your project is expected to improve drastically every 2-3 days.\n\nHence, everything will always be on fire and you'll always be playing catch-up games, if you want to make a good game, you will be crunching and sleep deprived (unless you are fine with failing all the other courses or making compromises on your project). You can never feel relaxed in your free time and will always feel anxious since everything is always on fire.\n\nAlthough no one in Digipen explicitly promotes crunch, the workload and expectation suggested otherwise. For the general workload of 19-21 credits per semester for a 4 years degree, to survive, its was always about workload prioritization, looking at your current grade for all classes and look for which class you can neglect to allocate time on the project/class that you find more important (usually GAM and GAT). Which will also make it very hard to get a high GPA in Digipen, making it more difficult to pursue a Master Degree afterward. Also, the way Digipen professors always show/promote a successful game that they showcase at PAX, kind of sets a standard project\u2019s scope that suggests an impossible workload without crunches.",

Also the project that actually landed me a job (and many interviews even after I gained professional exp) is a completely personal project where all knowledge was 99% self-study in my free time after I graduated.\n\nA side note for BSGD, if you want to change career from gamedev to SWE in tech, most of the thing you did for design classes ended up didn't really matter for landing an SWE job at all, so half of your crunches and sleepless night was meaningless (for SWE job you only need to have a few decent projects and Leetcoding skills). In that sense, Digipen is definitely not time efficient for me, if I were to just go to any other University and just focus on Leetcoding I could have easily land a 200k+ new grad tech job in bay area (many SWE role pay that much now in bay area for new grad: [level.fyi](https://level.fyi)).\n\nCompared to other schools, you can have work-life balance (compared to Digipen), have time to do side projects, internships, work part time, party, and still will be able to land high prestige jobs out of college (just Leetcode for CS job). In that sense, I didn't really need to suffer Digipen's \"side effects\" to land a job in the game industry or any CS career jobs (most of ppl in the industry didn't graduate from Digipen either).\n\nThough, one thing I would say is that graduating from BSGD degree, I have a much more well rounded skill set in both programming and design that is quite unique (not just programmers that watch a lot of Youtube videos about design). I believe it will be beneficial for those who want to start their own studio or work as a solo dev, yet it's not an appealing skill set for most companies that want specialists. So if you need a full-time job to stay alive, BSGD is definitely a tougher path.",

It's also what makes it hard to leave my current company right now since it has really good WLB and caring coworkers.\n\nWith all that said, it's also hard to put all the blame on Digipen since we've been warned every single minutes of being there that it's going to be a lot of hard work and it will not be for everyone (which still doesn't justify all the misery its students have to go through and they shouldn't be proud about it).\n\nIt's hard to convey how depressing some of those times were, but at the time, we had no choice but to keep working, it was the only thing we knew we could do at the time. I remember one day during my senior year, I got out of class in the afternoon, walked straight toward my team assigned work space to continue working on our game project that we've been putting thousands of hours into while getting paid $0 per hour (hell, we even paid the tuition fees). We were super sleep deprived, relying on a lot caffeine to stay awake, we exchange jokes: \"yea, even after we finished this, it won't even matter\", \"Players are going to play it and think its shit\", \"It's not even going to land us the job, nothing we do really matter\". Those were some jokes that we were exchanging, and looking back, those were definitely true for me.\n\nAll \"game projects\" that we put in blood, sweat, and tears into are treated as just \"school projects\" like any other school's projects (no different 1000 or 100 hrs), all \"game engine\" were treated as \"toy engine\" (still decent portfolio that\u2019s more impressive than game due to higher barrier of entry), it just as simple as that if you don't financially monetized it. So in that sense, a single easy internship is worth way more than all of the projects combined, since someone paid you to work. So, going through Digipen is not the best way to get into the industry, but to find a minimum amount of work to land an internship in a role that you desire (depends on company/roles, that will vary).",

A perfect 100 on an assignment is almost completely possible. I\u2019ve only ever got one and it\u2019s because I did tons of extra stuff. Crazy!",

As for proof, I have the original \"manifesto\" in my Google drive, but it has a large handful of private student names. I can copy some excerpts with names redacted here:\n\n&gt;There have been a plethora of instances where a student goes to a GAT211 instructor or TA, and asks about a project requirement, to which they can only answer that they don\u2019t know either.\n\n&gt;Alongside this issue, is the fact that information is, almost without fail, inconsistent across sources. Until recently, C. was under the impression that students were not allowed to change their projects before a defense \u2013 this was not the case.\n\n&gt;In one particular instance, C. said that if the journals (as referred to above) were not graded by midterm grading, that R. and the other designers would \u201cown their shit\u201d and grade them all at a 5/5. More recently, R. has said that this isn\u2019t happening, and that all of the journals would be graded at or by the end of the semester.\n\n&gt;When we requested earlier rubrics, or more clear communication as to what was actually meant to be in the projects, he accused his entire lecture of being \u201caddicted to rubrics\u201d. This is inappropriate, accusatory, and dismissive towards students. Many students were outraged by this accusation, and thought it was an extremely disproportionate reaction to requesting something we have received in every other class. \n\n\nAnd also\n\n\n&gt;As of the end of Week 8 of the 2018 Fall semester, Professor R. has not graded any of the biweekly journal assignments beyond the very first entry during Week 1. With these journals comprising 25% of our total grade in the class, this is quite worrisome. This lack of feedback has resulted in a lack of clarity about the current status of students\u2019 performance. Students are unsure about if their formatting, answers or procedures for such assignments are correct. Without time to respond to any corrections or feedback, students are likely to continue making the same mistakes for multiple assignments.\n\n&gt;Suggestions for how this can be improved are as follows:\n-Hire more TAs\n--More TAs means more eyes to grade journals \u2013 in previous GAT classes, TAs graded lesser assignments like this so that the burden did not fall to the instructors. Although the overall quality and fairness of grading came into question from some students, the assignments were graded promptly and students received feedback for them.\n-Lessen the grading requirements or number of journals/experiences\n--If the burden of grading these journals is too large for R. and/or his instructors, perhaps the rigor with which they are graded or the number of assignments is too high.\n\n\nAs for proof of actions that took place in person three years ago, no I don't have it. I'm sure the student council has some record of the multiple town hall meetings we attended to voice our complaints. I also have a dozen+ names attached to this complaint that attested to everything included within.",

Work load, huh, I received a BS degree in Chemical Engineering at UCSB in '84.  The freshman class at my time. who were top in math and science in their high school, was 242 declared Chemical Engineers,  graduating class was 41.  Don't talk to me about attrition.  Everyone going after a Chem E. degree was smart, the UCSB program was about how hard you could work, just like what I'm hearing in this video.  While time management was essential to survive in school, it was imprinted as a way to get ahead in real life.  You want the good jobs/pay you have to be not only smart but a hard worker.  Today, most youth I talk to do not understand really hard work, do or die commitment to a goal and how much you understand about yourself along the way.  Lotto mentality has crept into the culture to where money is supposed to just fall from the sky because you comment on Youtube about somebody else playing a video game, or your broke.  The idea your going to work real hard for a degree and work hard in industry for good pay over a long period of time to be financially successful is becoming alien to youth.  It is one reason why engineering jobs went overseas and why foreign born engineers are in great demand in the US.  They worked their butts off to get where they are and are grateful for the opportunity that the hard work presented.  Even if the workload is crushing, I want my kids to go through this program to understand their limits.  Make it or not they will learn where their limits are and how to deal with failure.  **Every single successful person has dealt with hard earned failure** and learned from it in a positive way.  That is what makes them successful.",

    "postText": "Not sure which I should go for, as I wish to have a strong foundation in programming, but also wish to become a game designer(not sure yet though)(Singapore, but i heard digipen in US and singapore are both similar).\n\n\n-RTIS work on building game engines in projects, more capable programmers\n\n-Intro to computer graphics instead of Intro to game design(5 credits)\n\n-Intro to real-time rendering instead of System design methods(5)\n\n-Computer network instead of Intro to psychology(5)\n\n-Programming massively parallel processors instead of Level design(5)\n\n-Spatial data structures instead of Technical design methods(5)\n\n-Low level programming instead of User interface and user experience design(5)\n\nAre the differences i can find. For the left side, how important are they? Is it a must have for programming games, are they hard to self-learn etc etc. And for the right side, are they hard to learn, is it a must have for designers etc etc(like psychology is a must have, but not sure the rest)\n\nWhich would you recommend as well? Thanks in advance!\n\ntldr Some differences in both courses, not sure which to take.",

            "comment": "From a cursory look at the course catalog, the Singapore BSCSIMGD (what a mouthful!) is pretty similar to the US BSCSGD. I only have experience with the US side of things, so take anything I say with a grain of salt, since that's what I'll be referring to.\n\nI'm a BSGD from the pre-2017 iteration of the degree. They changed the degree pretty radically in 2017, which shifted it from being essentially a double-major in both CompSci and Game Design (it took the vast majority of both BAGD's and RTIS's core) to essentially a major in CS and a minor in GD. There's no hard data on what that means for the employability of the students taking it, since the 2017 cohort are going to be 2021 grads, but given what I know about how difficult it was for 2019 and 2020 BAGD grads to find design jobs, I would be surprised if many of the 2021 BSGD grads end up working as designers, rather than on the programming side. Bluntly put, I just don't think there's enough design left in the degree for it to make designers. \n\n&gt; RTIS work on building game engines in projects, more capable programmers\n\nThis is generally true, but doesn't have to be in any particular case. I chose to work on gameplay and UI programming rather than things like core engine, but I know BSGDs who did core engine-y stuff.\n\nUnless you specifically want to work as a graphics programmer, you don't really need to go RTIS. BSGDs still get all the critical CS stuff. I don't think either will prepare you to be a designer, though, and RTIS definitely will not. The first and most important thing you need to figure out is whether you want to be an engineer or designer fundamentally. If you want to be an engineer, either CS degree is fine. If you want to be a designer, BAGD or another university are your best choices.",

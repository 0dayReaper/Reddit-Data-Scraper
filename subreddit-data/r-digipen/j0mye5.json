Checkout this site for others as well.\n\n[https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-game-design-ugrad](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-game-design-ugrad)\n\nI have personally worked with someone who went to UofU and he was competent in design and programming. Definitely not the end of the world if you don't get into DigiPen. There are other schools that can get you to a similar point and a lot of what you get out of a school is based on how much you put into it as well.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

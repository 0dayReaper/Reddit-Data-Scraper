    "postText": "I'm applying for the January semester (2016), but the last class I need finished and graded drops me out just a few weeks before this starts. That's no where near enough time to get transcripts, send, be accepted, move, etc.\n\nSo I need another option to satisfy Digipen's math GPA requirements. Would an SAT/ACT score do the trick, or is there something else?",

I can get it over 3.0 this summer, probably.\n\nThe big issue is the pre-calc requirement, and the summer semester doesn't have it as an option. That means I'd be using the semester after to satisfy that, but that ends mid-December.\n\nIf I had something I could do that tackled the GPA problem -and- the math pre-req, without taking an entire semester, I'd have a much better chance of getting in by January.",

    "postText": "I've seen people say that bagd's tend to have limited use in group projects because of lack of programming knowledge, so my question is, just how important is it to have lots of programming skills when there are engines like the unreal engine 4 which allow you to make complete games using simplified visual scripting languages? I'm not a student at digipen, I'm just at some community college for a psych degree, but I want to make video games so I have been working on personal projects in the unreal engine. All I've taken as far is computer science is a introduction course focused on c++. (Not that it has actually applied to my games)",

            "comment": "If you're an indie developer, just hacking a way on small personal projects; sure, you probably don't really need to have good programming skill, especially when using Unreal since it's blueprint system is extremely powerful.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, the second you step foot into the professional games industry, there's a high chance you're going to be using a studios proprietary engine that doesn't have visual scripting and requires some sort of actual programming work. You don't need to understand asymptotic complexity or be able to write in assembly, but you do need to be able to write code that works",

            "comment": "BAGDs tend to be less useful on custom engines because they have to wait for a lot of things to come online and after working in nice commercial engines like Unreal, working in a custom engine feels like being homeless in comparison, and in DigiPen there are a lot of programmer teams that make big custom engines. \n\nBAGDs should probably just avoid those because either they can do next to nothing or the out-of-engine prototype made by the BAGD ends up being superior to the finished custom engine game.",

            "comment": "I'd say just having a firm understanding of programming concepts will improve any programming related thing you work on, whether it be in a visual scripting language, a regular scripting language or other more hardcore languages.\n\nDoes a BAGD student need to know the above? Not necessarily, but it will make finding a job after DigiPen much easier.\n\nAlso I agree with others here that a lot of game teams write their own engines. When I attended DigiPen everyone below senior level had to roll their own engines actually.\n\nSo, all in all, I think it's super important for any designer to know some programming as it will help them better understand how games are made.\n\nEDIT: Corrections",

I don't know if BAGDs have to do that anymore cause I heard the programming courses got moved over to zero engine which is already a game engine. Flash was more or less for websites.",

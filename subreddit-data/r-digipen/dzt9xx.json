    "postText": "Hi all, I am planning to do BSCGD in Digipen Singapore and i think I saw some modules that have 3d modelling/art. May I know which 3d modelling software does Digipen use/teach? Maya or Blender? I\u2019m bad at art in general so I would like to practice a little before I enter Digipen.\n\n* Studied diploma in Computer Engineering previously and got a pretty badly grade at a 3d modelling module(AutoCAD).",

            "comment": "The industry standard for 3d modeling is maya. If you are already used to an engineering modeling program then good luck, the transition from solidworks to cinema 4d was interesting to say the least. Disclamer: didn't end up applying to digipen, forgot I was on this sub. I am going into animation as a career and know a decent amount",

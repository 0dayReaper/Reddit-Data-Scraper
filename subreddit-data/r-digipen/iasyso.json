    "postText": "Heard US and Singapore digipen are pretty similar, so\n\nShould i specifically go for game design degree, and work on my programming skills, or game programming, and make games for like 4 years to learn game design(among other self-learning tools)?\n\nMy goal is to become a game designer(a newbie still at game scripting and i'm fine with it, but it's not where most of my interest lies). Is what they teach at game design something that can be easily self-taught? Is it valuable to employers in the future? Can i learn it by just making games for 4 years? \n\nWhat about game programming degree? Is it something i'll be able to teach myself through stuff like youtube and books and making games?\n\nI'm confident in bearing through the hardships that come with both degrees, but which one will better help me in the future for employment as a game designer?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks in advance:D",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a sophomore Game Designer and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Basically the difference between the two degrees is that the programmers learn how to MAKE the game, while the Designers learn how to make the game FUN. Which is tough because how do you teach fun? But our whole degree is learning how to and practicing our skills in player engagement through a number of different aspects - \n\nLevel/Narrative design- learning how to construct a level so the player can easily make their way through and not get bored. Also learning how to construct the story and encounters in your game so it feels narratively satisfying for the player. \n\nSystem design - how balance the game. What new mechanics need to be added to keep the players attention. What mechanics need to be taken away also. \n\nUI (user interface)/ UX (user experience) - creating menus and HUDs for the player so they understand everything they need to. Making sure they understand when things are happening in the game with as little \u201cthinking\u201d as possible i.e. when you player gets hit they play an obvious hit animation the player recognizes as \u201cI just got hit\u201d instead of checking your health every second. \n\nAnd if you still have a budding interest in programming we still take those classes. We learn how to build prototypes (basic versions) of our games so we can playtest them before we group up with programmers to really flesh out the game. You can even take more advanced programming classes earlier on, like I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m taking a second semester junior level programming class a year and a half early so I can build up my skills.",

I was thinking about taking up this course if it taught me much more than what I could on my own, because by taking the programmers course I could learn to program my own games to learn game design and still learn really advanced coding, but i was not sure if i would miss out on alot of game design. \n\nProbably gonna take up game design course next time then, thanks:)\n\nOh, and is the programming lessons you're taking right now enough to fully create a small game(like eternal senia or zenonia or maybe even something like undertale)? :D",

Programming is very step by step and (for the most part) is memorization. Remembering how to write certain code to get the best functionality. \n\nGame design on the other hand is more nebulous. It\u2019s hard to define what \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cengaging\u201d is. We learn the ins and outs of PlayTesting procedures, how to tweak and fix your game, etc. stuff that is hard to teach yourself when not under direct instructions and grading. \n\nAs for if you can make a game, definitely. We are taught unity and C# language. Just in my 2 semesters so far I\u2019ve built a number of games ranging from pong, to frogger, to a horror game me and 2 other game designers built for a project last semester.",

            "comment": "Hello, I figured I'd chime in with a different angle. I graduated from the BSGD degree in 2012.\n\nUnderstanding game design definitely helps but it's definitely also very important to know how to, at the very least, prototype your design ideas within a game engine. It can be difficult to get into the industry if all your focus is on conceptual/paper design as you have to be damn good at it for someone just to hire you for that specific skill (typically that kind of stuff goes to more experienced designers in the industry). So definitely learn those programming fundamentals.\n\nThe footprint for programming is also much larger than game design and is transferable to other professions, not to say game design is not it's just that programming has more direct tranferability. Programmers usually get paid more than designers as well.\n\nEven so though, as a designer you can eventually get up to getting paid very well. I started as an associate designer at a AA studio making \\~35k and worked my way up to a AAA studio (2-3 years later) making \\~50k (with OT it ranged from 70k to 80k) and then about a year ago I became a senior designer and now make \\~100k. But, to put things in perspective, I knew programmers that came directly out of DigiPen making 80K+ with a signing bonus, haha. I'm sure most of those were working at Microsoft NOT on games, but I could be wrong about that.\n\nWhatever your decision ends up being just keep pushing forward and work your butt off. Once you're out of DigiPen you'll likely never have to deal with anything as stressful! Even having been in crunch it never really felt as stressful as DigiPen could be at times, haha.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.",

It's good to know that digipen is still hard not just for programming but also for game design, i probably won't learn as much otherwise.\n\nGonna work on my c# and unity, thanks:D\n\np.s. I was kinda worried about my future and how i'm gonna support others with like $2500 per month ill prob earn after digipen, glad to know that it gets better from there:)",

                            "comment": "Yeah, it might be a slow start but you can get to higher numbers. All depends on the companies you work for obviously. For company jumps for me it was\n\n1) AA - Associate Designer - 6 months(laid off with whole team) \n\n2) AAA - QA Tester - 6 months(Left for design job)\n\n3) AA - Designer  - 8 months(laid off with most of team)\n\n4) mobile - Designer  - 4 months(left for AAA design job)\n\n5) AAA - Designer (to Senior Designer) - still here\n\nMy beginning was definitely rough and it honestly required me to leave Seattle to find a job I was able to stay at but I sort of blame that on my lack of experience as most places up that way were looking for senior level people at the time. Things always ebb and flow. All depends on where each company is at in their dev cycle.\n\nOnce you hit senior you're doing pretty well as you usually get salaried at that point if you're not already. So while you do have to sometimes work long hours you don't have to rely on it for determining your paycheck which is nice. Before I hit senior I'd intentionally just be working 10 hour days to get OT.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

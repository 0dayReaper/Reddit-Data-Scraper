Would it be hard to find a job when I graduate? Digipen isn't cheap and I'm scared of spending a lot of money for an arts degree if I won't be able to find a job.\n2. What kind of jobs can I get? I love games but I'm not sure if I want to work in games my whole life or at all but I am interested in ux design.\n\nDigipen's been on my radar for a year now but I don't wanna spend a lot if the degree won't find me a job.\n\nThanks for reading",

            "comment": "Hello, I graduated in 2012 (BSCSGD) so my knowledge isn't quite up to date. After reviewing the info directly from Digipen's website and reading what you have said I'll give you my thoughts.\n\nGonna start with #2 first. If you're uncertain about going into the game industry I'd suggest not to go to DigiPen, especially due to the cost as you mentioned. If you were pursuing the programming degree I'd say that's fine as those degrees are highly sought after by Microsoft and other big companies. BAGD is definitely a design heavy degree into gaming and you're gonna get a lot of push back from companies that are not in the gaming industry.\n\nI also personally haven't seen a ton of UX roles(potentially a small footprint of available roles) and typically the ones I have seen have required a lot of experience. But it seems like UI design may be the direction to start out at and work to UX.\n\n\\#1 as a pure designer it's gonna be tough to find a job since you're competing with a lot of other people. If you do decide to go to DigiPen I'd suggest getting comfortable with scripting/programming and being confident in those skills as that opens up more roles you can get into. To be honest, your first role in the gaming industry isn't going to be the one you want most likely. You're going to apply to a ton of places and just hope a couple pull you in for the interview process.\n\nOverall though if you're uncertain and don't have a strong desire of working in the game industry I'd say look towards a state school as that removes the stigma of going to a \"gaming college\".\n\nOR don't go to college at all and attempt to learn this stuff on the fly. There is now tons of info online about making games. You could start looking into Unreal Engine 4/5 or Unity tutorials and start making a game right now. That's a massive undertaking but some people thrive in that environment.\n\nI wish you well on making your decision and feel free to ask more questions!",

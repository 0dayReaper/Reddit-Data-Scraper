    "postText": "(edit: figured it out)\n\nhey guys! i am currently preparing my application for the february 1 deadline but have run into a bit of confusion with the digital portfolio. when i try to upload an art piece it will compress the file which greatly reduces the resolution, so it\u2019s really hard to see most details - i\u2019m unsure if this is just showing it as a thumbnail image, or if i am doing something incorrectly. does anyone who has applied to this degree program before know if it\u2019s a normal thing? thanks :\u2019)",

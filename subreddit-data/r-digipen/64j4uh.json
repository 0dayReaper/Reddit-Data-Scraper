I heard it's hard ,but no idea what do mean by hard as in what makes it hard is there a certain aspect of the college which makes it hard . If I try can I make it and will a noob in programming (who is willing to learn by giving up anything) be able to cope up with the college curriculum.\n\nYou guys are studying there, so this is the best place to ask.\nPlease help me ",

Basically, it was a year of primer that was mandatory but you either didn't get grades for/they didn't count toward your Masters.\n\nThe students I knew that went through that had a rough first half of their first semester, but after that they seemed to be fine.

DigiPen prepares you for a very stressful industry, by putting you under more pressure then what you'll experience in the industry. \n\nIf you can survive DigiPen, the industry is a walk in the park (at least workload/stress levels) ",

            "comment": "Since difficulty is rather subjective, I'll say that the MSCS is generally easier than the undergrad. It will likely be stressful; you may have little time for outside socialization. If you have a longer commute, or responsibilities outside of school, you will have even less free time. Time management is extremely important. Get stuff \"done\" as early as possible, then spend extra time polishing if you feel it is necessary.\n\nGood luck!",

Sometimes you can use the same project for two classes, but often times, not so much. The stress is often choosing a quality bar you are happy with versus the amount of projects you have yet to do.\n\nIt's a decent simulation of real world pressures to be sure.",

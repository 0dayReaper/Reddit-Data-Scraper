Kind of like taking GAM100. \n\nI took it before they switched to the Zero Engine but it should be the same concept. \n\nIt's a good way to gauge your interest in some of the content but it will in no way prepare you for the real deal. Recommended course load is pretty huge and prepare for lots and lots of math. \n\nKeep in mind I took it in 2007 I believe so it could have changed extensively between then and now.",

            "comment": "I took the one at Sno-Isle Tech Skills Center circa 2013-2014. I don't know how close that was to yours, but I feel pretty okay assuming it was similar.\n\nIt's significantly easier than your first semester at DigiPen, both in terms of content and especially in terms of hours. I was able to get straight As and be top of the class there without too much trouble, and that is definitely not true here at DP. \n\nThe hours is the real kicker. The material itself, especially early on, is not that hard to grasp - it's that you have so much to grasp so quickly that it's hard to do it all. \n\nThe skills center stuff is a good tool to grasp whether or not you have a natural aptitude for any of the topics, if you like them, and to help make your first semester smoother by teaching you a little bit beforehand, but there's a very good reason it's a highschool class and you don't get credit for it.",

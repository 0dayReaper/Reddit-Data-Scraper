    "postText": "I am Indonesian and have the choice to attend either the campus in Redmond or the Singapore campus. \n\nSince the Singapore campus is a branch and is relatively new, the curriculum/facilities might not be as developed as the one in Redmond. On the other hand, it's a lot closer to my home country and so it's my parents' preferred option. \n\nI also don't know much about what life is like in either city (living costs do seem to be cheaper in Singapore).\n\nThere is also the issue of networking/job prospects as a Digipen graduate in the US vs. Singapore. Could anyone who've attended Digipen enlighten me with some of your insights?",

            "comment": "Singapore BSGD student here.  \nAs far as curriculum goes. Singapore and Redmond share the same course sequences and syllabus across modules. Singapore's syllabus is mostly developed by the main campus in Redmond with a few exceptions here and there. I do find however that there is a strong focus on Computer Science in the Singapore Campus and a **really** strong focus on Design on the Redmond Campus. Both of them are **equally demanding** however I do find that the lecturers in Redmond are one of the best I ever had.\n\nAlso note that there are degrees that are only offered in either campus. Singapore only offers the SEEMS (System Engineering \\[ElectroMechanical Systems\\] while Redmond only offers the Digital Music and Sound Design program. Digipen Singapore is also affiliated with Singapore Institution of Technology (SIT) which also have their own degree programs as well.  \nOn your second Summer in the Singapore Campus, you need to spend a semester (10 weeks) in the Redmond Campus as part of the OIP requirements, so if you decide to go to Singapore instead; you will have the chance to visit Redmond (which is really awesome by the way but also means extra costs)\n\nHousing wise, Singapore is a clear winner in that regard.  \nHousing in Redmond campus is really pricey, most students who do not live locally around the area opt to stay in the school-owned apartments (Digipen Housing LLC), which is probably the cheapest in the area. The cost per year would put you back minimum USD 7350.  \n [https://www.digipen.edu/campus-life/housing/costs-and-amenities](https://www.digipen.edu/campus-life/housing/costs-and-amenities)   \nThe Singapore Campus does not own any student dorms however there are many room listings around the immediate area (in Dover) that averages around SGD550 per month. Even if you opt to stay somewhere else, Singapore is a small country with a tightly knitted transportation system, the campus is right outside the Dover station so it shouldn't too big of an issue.  \n [https://www.gumtree.sg/s-property/room+for+rent+dover/v1c2q0p1](https://www.gumtree.sg/s-property/room+for+rent+dover/v1c2q0p1) \n\nFood and Amenities wise, I feel that Singapore is more of your cup of tea since you mentioned you are Indonesian.  \nThe Singapore campus resides in Singapore Polytechnic, which has a bunch of school subsided food courts and free student amenities which you can use as a SIT student (which Digipen Singapore students are also are). Food over at the Singapore campus are rightly more Asian styled with some stores selling Indonesian cuisine (Food Courts 3/4/2). \n\nThe Redmond campus has the Bitz and Bytes cafe which serves pizza/deli sandwiches and pasta/rice meals; Portions are quite generous but I do find them a tab pricey (though its the cheapest option in the area besides cooking for yourself). I did notice that the locals prefer to bring their own home-cooked meals instead during my time over there.\n\nNetworking/Job wise  \nThere is a high demand among Digipen Graduates in recent years in Singapore ( [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-sit-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-sit-ges-2018.pdf)). However Redmond is central to a couple of triple AAA game companies like Nintendo/Valve/343. They do regular talks and recruitment in Digipen Redmond from time to time. \n\nThe game industry in Singapore is still relatively small due to a risk-adverse culture that is usually prevalent in Asian countries. It is however, steadily growing thanks to support from the government (IMDA). The scape around here are mostly smaller indies with a few AAA companies ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_game\\_companies\\_in\\_Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_companies_in_Singapore) ). Singapore graduates usually work for the listed companies or one of a similar field. I do notice CompSci graduates being hired by non gaming-related companies like Acronis (Cyber-Security) and Continental (Auto-mobile).  \n\n\nSchool fees:  \nRedmond Campus  \n [https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/financial-aid/cost-of-attendance](https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/financial-aid/cost-of-attendance)   \nSingapore Campus  \n [https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/sites/default/files/AY2019-2020%20Tuition%20Fees%20Structure\\_23%20May%202019.pdf](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/sites/default/files/AY2019-2020%20Tuition%20Fees%20Structure_23%20May%202019.pdf)   \nDo take note that if you are not planning to take the non-subsidized fees tier (you opt to take the MOE grant), you need to work in a Singapore owned entity for 3 working years.  \n [https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/tgis/normal/studentViewServiceObligationSubsidyInfo.action](https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/tgis/normal/studentViewServiceObligationSubsidyInfo.action) \n\nThere are a bunch of differences between the Singapore and Redmond campus but I can assure you that they both provide the same quality education that Digipen is (in)famous for, if you want to know anything else let me know!",

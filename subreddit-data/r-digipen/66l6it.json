Between this school and one other, the difference comes down to cost. The other school I can pay for much easier. So I ask current students: What does Digipen for sure have better than other schools, and would you consider the education worthwhile?",

I'll be enrolled at Digipen next year. I'm aware of the heavy workload and lack of free time, but I'll be ready for it. The end debt will be rather large, even if I do get the returning scholarships, but I feel it will be worth it. RIT is still the backup if things go astray horridly. \n\nAs for changing majors to BAGD instead of BSCSGD, I'll leave that to after at least my first year. I'll decide after that if I should change, based on your suggestions and my observations.\n\nI...I hope to make an impact!",

            "comment": "I made this post a while back:\n\n&gt; 3rd year BSGD here. I don't know about the scholarship, but I would advise you to consider another degree or another university. It was already brutally difficult to complete in 4 years before it got changed, and a lot of people dropped out. We're down to 11 in my cohort out of about 40-50, with most on the 5 year plan and I think all of the rest having taken summers. The changes they made to the degree were for the worse I think - here's an excerpt from a post I made about them:\n\n&gt;&gt;In my personal opinion, the new sequence is not good. It has a few nice points (14 fewer credits, less classes marked as core), but you lose a GAT course, a CS course, and both open electives. You're now required to take PHY250, which is brutal and not very relevant for BSGDs, as well as more PHY/MAT in general, and another ENG course. If you're an artsy BSGD, you get completely wrecked, because you can now only take 1 ART/CG class for credit - before you could take up to 5. You can technically take BIO for your MAT/PHY/BIO elective credits, except there are like three BIO courses that you can get credit for, and they're all made for BFAs. Good luck passing an upperclassman BFA class as a BSGD.\n\n&gt;Since posting that, I've learned that they intend to add more science-y BIO courses, but who knows when or if that will become reality.\n\n&gt;Really, do your future self a favor and go into a degree that less than 75% of people drop out of and more than 12% actually graduate on time. BAGD is much less difficult, but still quite time consuming. It has less good job prospects than BSGD, but all the really dedicated and skilled BAGDs I've seen have gotten good jobs. I wouldn't recommend it either, honestly, but it's a better alternative to BSGD. RTIS is the degree the school is known for, and it's as good as they make it out to be. Given my prior criticisms of the school, I hope you understand how much me praising RTIS is worth. It still has a high drop-rate, but it's a lot more doable, and you can still be a part of design on your game teams. BSCS is newer so I have less to go on for it, but it seems to be mostly the RTIS degree, so I assume it's at least OK.\n\n\n-\nOne thing I learned from attending GDC in the time between that post and now is that I held  the BAGD degree to too high of a standard. Yes, it pales in comparison to the CS degree, but there's not a single college *anywhere* that really has game design education figured out, and DigiPen's BAGD program looks very strong relative to other design programs. Additionally, the degree got a new program director, who has been working with the me and several other students to improve the program, and based on his track record and the classes of his I've taken, I think he'll make a big impact.\n\nIt would also help to know what the other school you're considering is. There are some great programs out there, but also some I'd recommend you stay away from. Either way, if you come to DigiPen, think very hard about being a BSGD, as you can change degree tracks easily once you're here.",

The BSGD degree is being reworked pretty heavily for the cohort starting this fall, and I don't think those changes are for the positive. They're making them in an effort to gain ABET accreditation, which is what's required to work at some engineering places, like Boeing, but I think it ends up leaving the students worse off in terms of games industry skills. \n\nI don't know RIT in the same detail I do DigiPen, of course, but I don it's one of the other top schools in the country in terms of getting into the industry, so you've got two good choices.",

Yes, you'll be qualified for the widest array of jobs, but that will be because you're functionally a double major. There's very few opportunities that a BSGD is qualified for that either an RTIS or BAGD wouldn't be. \n\nIt provides as good of a base *in terms of getting into design* as any other design degree anywhere, but game design is a field with very few openings, especially compared to something like CS where jobs are abundant. The job security of a CS degree is unrivaled, which is one advantage of being a BSGD, and one of the reasons I am one. That said, I'm not any more qualified for most design roles than an equally skilled BAGD.",

            "comment": "Hello, BSGD alumni here. I graduated in 2012, and while I'm in a great position in the industry, I'm also in loads of debt due to attending DigiPen.\n\nTo be clear though, I took out federal and personal loans to cover the entire cost of DigiPen. So, by the time I graduated I was in debt for a little over $100,000. \n\nI was lucky enough to get a Design job right out of school, which is difficult for any student attempting to get into the industry but it was short lived.\n\nThe company unfortunately had all of their projects shutdown by their respective publisher and had to let everyone go.\n\nI then, after a month or two of unemployment, had to take up a job as a QA tester just so I could get a steady income again. Almost a year into that gig I was able to get another design job where I shipped my first game. Once we shipped though there wasn't another project to move on to so the whole team was let go within a couple of weeks of shipping the game.\n\nAfter another round of unemployment and madly filling out applications I took a job at a mobile company so I could get a steady paycheck again. Luckily for me, one of my applications was able to get me an interview at a AAA game studio and I did well enough where I eventually received an offer and started work there. I still work at this company.\n\nToday I'm in $80,989.52 of student loan debt. The times I was umemployed were rough and it's simply a lot of money to continue paying off. \n\nI still feel that I'm one of the lucky ones though since I was able to pull myself out of unemployment twice when I hear about so many people that have been unable to or had to trash their dreams to get a reliable job.\n\nAll in all, will DigiPen help you get into the industry? Most certainly. Will it be worth it? I'm not so certain with how much it costs.\n\nThis gig I have now is the first job I have had out of DigiPen where I feel that I'm able to do things outside of simply going to work day in and day out.\n\nEven with how much I make now though the goal of buying a house or even a nice car still seem far off. My monthly loan payments almost exceed my rent. I love what I do though, so there's that.\n\nI personally think that if you want to succeed and get into the game industry you can achieve that no matter what school you choose to go to. It all just depends on how motivated you are.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I feel that I could never have gotten into the industry without DigiPen's help. I needed the rigorous schedule that DigiPen offers to motivate myself to work hard and learn things to get into the industry.",

            "comment": "Hey! Reading a previous comment I saw you are stuck between RIT and DigiPen - before I begin, Ill let you know that I was in the same boat! Rewind a year ago, and I was literally deciding between the same two schools. \n\nI chose DigiPen over RIT for a number of reasons. I'll start with the two most important ones. \n\nFirst off, the community. DigiPen is has a community unlike no other. The people here are dedicated, passionate and unbelievably intelligent. While RIT definitely has those people, I felt like I was back in high school. Surrounded by people who just didn't really seem to care about me or what they were doing. DigiPen felt like a family. A home away from home (home was long island)\n\nMy second reason, is because DigiPen is more difficult. RIT was offering me too much time to myself. There, I wasn't forced to focus on my craft. RITs classes are simpler and much higher level then what DigiPen offers me. For example,  RIT teachers C# first semester. DigiPen taught me C and introduced me to assembly.  \n\nFinally, and just as important as the rest - DigiPen was more focused. Every single course I am taking here at DigiPen pushes me closer to being ready for the Industry. Every course teaches me something new and useful for my career path. RIT does not do this to the same extent. For example, I know someone at RIT who took a class about anime. \n\nYes, DigiPen is more expensive.\n\nBut fuck, it's worth every penny.",

    "postText": "So I had always been told that DigiPen was a really good school, but someone recently told me that they'd heard otherwise.  My main concern is employability after graduation.  I want to go work in the Digital Arts, preferably at a video game company, what's the likelihood of that going to be after I graduate from DigiPen with an MFA in Digital Arts.  Is DigiPen a good school and is it worth it to go there?",

It's pretty much entirely based on your portfolio and personality. There are a lot of great artists at Digipen, but there are plenty of less great ones too. Digipen is a school that tries to make you better by shoving a ton of work down your throat and forcing you to improve enough to handle it. If you put it a ton of time and effort, you will likely grow enough that you can get a job.\n\nIt's also possible to skate by with the minimum amount of work (which is still a lot), not improve much, and pretty much be where you are now with more debt. I've heard the undergrad art profs are brutally critical of work, idk if that's the case with the master's program. If you can't take criticism, you should probably avoid it though.\n\nIf you want to do art for games, digipen is a good place, there are tons of teams making games, and everyone wants artists so you should have no trouble finding a team to contribute art to, and then you graduate with shipped games and experience working on a team.\n\nI can't tell you if it's worth it or not, but merely warn you that it won't be worth it unless you try really, really hard to make it worth it.",

If you click on the course catalog on the left and go to the CG section, you'll also be able to find a bunch of potential 3D modeling classes you could take, if that's what you're interested in taking.\n\nNot an artist either, so I can't really tell you a whole lot about the program, though. I'm sure if you contact the head of the department, they could connect you with a current student or maybe an alumni.",

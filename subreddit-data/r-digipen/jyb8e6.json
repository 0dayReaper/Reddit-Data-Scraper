    "postText": "If i was to take additional module/electives/minor provided by digipen for BAGD students for learning scripting and programming skills, no matter how hard, can I become a game programmer using those skills? Can I easily make my own games without being limited by my programming capabilities? Will I be hireable as a game programmer? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Current BS in Computer Science and Game Design - graduating this December\n\nI would say the short answer is no. Maybe there's an example that would prove me wrong, but I think you would really have to go out of your way to be hired as a software engineer after graduating with the BAGD. Being hirable as a game programmer isn't just about writing code, there's lots of other classes CS majors take to learn what's really under the hood of a computer, and advanced math topics are really important too.\n\nSome BAGDs do just take the core CS track, but even then that's not quite as much. There's also just expectation in your project classes - if you're a CS student, you're going to write code that will make up the bulk of your experience on your resume. If you're a BAGD on a project team, you won't be expected to write any code and will instead have other responsibilities.\n\nIf you want to be hired as a gameplay programmer, my opinion would be to enroll in the BSCSGD (obviously biased), and take extra design classes as it seems you clearly have a desire to learn design.\n\nEDIT: That being said, I do know there are several BAGDs who know how to script well enough to get their more complex vision realized in their solo projects, and they do awesome stuff. I think my above comments apply most directly to the AAA job space.",

Appreciate it:)",

            "comment": "Hi! I am a second year BAGD. \n\nSo your question has a couple different parts to it so I\u2019ll address those separately. \n\nThere are a bunch of CS classes available to BAGD\u2019s. We can even declare a minor so that,if you choose to, you can take more CS heavy classes. One of the facets of game design is Technical Design which is heavy CS. The default track has a good amount of CS classes but they don\u2019t go tooooo deep into programming. \n\nSecondly, you definitely can make your own games without the need of a programmer. We learn Unity scripting. Which allows us to make a whole host of various games and genres. We learn C# scripting. I\u2019ve personally built games both solo in unity and in teams of only BAGD\u2019s. \n\nLastly, the BAGD track isn\u2019t really designed for you to be hired  as a game programmer. That really is a lot more than just learning scripting. There\u2019s a lot of in depth learning that goes into that. We are getting jobs as Designers. The easiest way I can really describe the difference between the two is that Programmers MAKE the game. They build the actual components. While designers make the game FUN. We deal with balance. New mechanics. Level design. Stuff like that. \n\nFor example. This semester I am in a big group project with other designers, programmers, artists, etc. the programmers(BSCSGD and RTIS) are building the engine we\u2019ll be using. While the designers are creating and prototype (basically we\u2019re building a proof of concept) in unity.",

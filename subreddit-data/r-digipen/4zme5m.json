    "postText": "I was just today accepted into Digipen, and am looking for a roommate to stay with. I haven't chosen exactly where I will be staying, but it would be a 2-bedroom apartment at one of the associated apartment complexes, most likely The Gates of Redmond or Olde Redmond Place. Rent should be around $1000 each, not including utilities.\n\nFor myself, I'm a 27 year old white male, fairly introverted. I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, and would expect the same of my roommate, at least in and around the apartment. I'm quiet and know how to keep the common areas clean, and again would expect the same from my roommate.\n\nObviously since classes are starting so soon, there isn't a lot of time, so if you're interested please contact me ASAP so we can work out the details.\n\nEdit: As was suggested, it we're able to find more than just the 1 other roommate, then we could also rent a 3-bed room, which would be ~$700 a month, or if you are willing to share a room, then we could rent a 2-bed apartment and do a 40/30/30 split (so $600 for each of you, $800 for me). Similarly for a 3-bed, if we had 4-5 people then some could share a room. Since I have sleep apnea, I need a room to myself to sleep in, but aside from that I'm flexible.",

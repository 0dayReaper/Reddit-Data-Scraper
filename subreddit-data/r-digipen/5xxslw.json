    "postText": "My name is Zoheb and I got into the MS in CS  program at digipen.\n\nI'm looking for potential roommates or a room if it's available to share.\nI decided against applying for the  college housing and thought I would check out off-campus housing.\n\nFrom what I've found, Trailwoods is the way to go. I've calculated that sharing a 3 bed room with with 4 people has very good value.\n\nSo if anyone is interested do let me know. I don't think it matters whether you're a master's or a bachelor's student, atleast not to me. Everyone needs a place to stay. :p\n\nA bit about myself. I am a male, Indian, age 22. Will turn 23 this year. Big on anime and gaming especially indie games and good stories and..\nDOTA 2 .. :(\n\nI'm a quiet and shy person and won't get in your way that much and think of myself as helpful to those who ask for it.\n\nI have no big demands from a roommate other than just being a nice person really :p\nSo hit me up if anyone is interested.\n\nWe can discuss the situation.\n\nCheers!",

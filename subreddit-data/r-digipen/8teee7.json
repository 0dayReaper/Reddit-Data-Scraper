    "postText": "Heyall, I'm going into my senior year of high school and I've been increasingly interested in Digipen, starting 3 years ago when my computer science class (not AP, i.e. Java, but a principles class using what's effectively a Scratch equivalent) went on a field trip to Microsoft and Digipen.\n\nI'm not a high GPA student, but I am doing Running Start, Washington's dual-credit system, and I'll be graduating high school with an AA in CS. Additionally, I just took the SAT for the first time, and scored 1520, 99th percentile, a score I expect to raise. My hobbies are mostly art and sport related right now, art encompassing traditional, digital, 2D animation, and special effects. I am also working with a friend on designing and building a keralox rocket engine, and I'm working on a filtration system for an aquarium.\n\nAlright, that concludes my merit monologue, sorry about that. \n\nMy questions are mostly about what qualifies an applicant, in your experiences, particularly for the CS degrees, and even more particularly in RTIS, but also about what qualifies an applicant for scholarships. My curiosity about the latter was initiated by my relatively high SAT score.\n\n* What does Digipen typically look for in application essays?\n* What SAT scores are the norm for Digipen?\n* Will Digipen see my AA in Computer Science as a qualifier?\n* What sort of extracurricular activities are most prominently looked at?\n* Will previous experience in computer science help me a lot?\n* Should I have a portfolio of scripts, games, and software I have written?\n* Will my forays into entrepreneurship and art through my creative endeavors help me look better?\n* If you are LGBT+, how comfortable are you on campus?\n* Did being LGBT+ seem to have a say in your acceptance? (I ask this because I am gay.)\n\nAll in all, I hope Digipen is the school for me. I'll be fine if it isn't, but if current students could help me see if I'm a good fit, that would be awesome and would definitely help me. Sorry for the walls of text and the big \"self-praise\" section up top, but that has to do with how juicy I want to make myself look on my college apps.\n\nThanks for the read and any responses!",

            "comment": "Hello, I'm not gonna be able to get you super recent info about this stuff but I'll try to tell you as much as I can and hopefully someone else will chime in here. I graduated in 2012 as a BSGD now known as BSCSGD.\n\n1) I had to write an essay but I'm certain it's different now. I'm sure they are looking for passion in building games. Hopefully someone more recent can answer that question better.\n\n2) Best to see if the registrar from DigiPen can answer that or someone in the admin office. There should be a number on the DigiPen website to get in contact with them.\n\n3) Depends on the descriptions of each class you took. The registrar should have a better idea on what will transfer. (I think that would be the registrar? Regardless, there is somebody at the school who handles these things)\n\n4) A question probably best for the registrar or administrative people there. If you have a chance to do it and live close by you can see about shadowing a student for a day and ask them a lot of questions as well.\n\n5) Yes, it most certainly will, just be open for change and updating the way you do things. DigiPen teaches you from the ground up, especially with programming so you'll be learning the basics *again* but you may have a better understanding of it from the way it is taught at DigiPen.\n\n6) Sure, I'm not sure how much they look at those things for RTIS. I know we had to provide something like that for the BSGD degree though.\n\n7) Potentially. I'm not sure how much they'll care about the arts when it comes to the RTIS degree, but it does show passion which is a key component of making games.\n\n8) I have heard some horrible stories from people who were in the LGBT+ club called PRISM when I was there, but I'm not sure if that was the norm or edge cases(I wasn't a part of the club and I am hetero). I'd say it's getting better since I was there? (I was not on the lookout for these types of things, though I'd imagine some things happened in front of me that I would now notice).\n\n9) Hopefully someone else can better answer this, but I will say that there are a ton of awkward kids at the school who may or may not have interacted with a diverse set of people so their first experience with other types of people may have adverse effects. Basically imagine the plethora of nerdy kids who love games and throw them all into a school.\n\nI'll leave this post with one last thing. Make absolutely sure that you want to attend and that you are willing to go into loads of debt($100,000+) to complete the schooling. Or that the loans are covered by other means. DigiPen is extremely expensive and it will literally be affecting you're life for potentially decades after you graduate. You will be able to pay them off very quickly if say you get a job at Amazon or Microsoft, but many gaming studios don't pay as well as their tech company counterparts.\n\nAlso, good on you for all that you have done so far, keep it up!\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

They can help answer most of your questions, and they can also put you in contact with a student ambassador that you can shadow a class with and email questions with. These are really great questions for people actively involved with the school and not just some random people on Reddit.\n\nThe only questions I feel even a lightly capable of giving my opinion on are the last two. I can't speak for the LGBT+ people on campus, but mkst of my friends are LGBT+ and they have not shared many negative experiences with me. That's not to say they never happen, but it's not common and if reported to administration with proof, they would take care of it. Harrassment in general is something they've taken a much bigger stand against in the last couple years. I can speak on that firsthand with some things that happened earlier in my time at Digipen \n\nI don't think being LGBT+ has anything to do with admissions either. I know digipen is really trying to even out the tech degrees gender ratio, but I've never heard ant admin speak on any connection between LGBT+ and acceptance. ",

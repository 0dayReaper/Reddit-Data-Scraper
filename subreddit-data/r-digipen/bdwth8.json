    "postText": "Is there issue with getting in to a masters program at another university after getting a BSCSGD degree from DigiPen? I am concerned that because DigiPen is nationally accredited that their degree may not meet the entrance requirements for a master program at a regionally accredited university.\n\nFor example, from the [University of Utah](http://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/req-adm/):\n\n&gt;You may apply if you have received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a **regionally accredited** college or university.",

    "postText": "Hey there, I'm going to be graduating in a few months with a bachelor's in Game Design, Computer Science, and Mathematics, and I'm looking to get into a grad school. I'm a programmer, and I'm seeking a master's degree that would still lend itself well to jobs outside of the games industry, mainly to have a fallback plan as I know of plenty of programming jobs out there. As for what I'm looking to get out of it: I want to develop my skills further and gain new understanding of both programming and game design. It isn't really even in the interest of getting a better job, it's more for my own person journey to push myself farther. Cost isn't really a factor, I'm willing to pay good money for a good program. Digipen had always had my eye, as I have heard tales of it being a very intensive and powerful learning experience, and with their master's degree simply being a \"Masters in Computer Science\" I thought it may hold some water outside of the gaming industry as well. What are your opinions of it?\n\nAs a side note, these were several other programs I was looking into as well:\n\nwww.fiea.ucf.edu\n\nwww.smu.edu/guildhall\n\nwww.gapp.usc.edu/graduate-programs/masters/computer-science/computer-science-game-development\n\nAny thoughts on these?",

            "comment": "I found it quite nice, but my undergrads were engineering related, not so much programming and game design.\n\nGiven that you will be graduating with a BSGD and BSCS, you may not necessarily find the program overly helpful in going into the industry... however if you are angling for teaching, then I could recommend it.",

            "comment": "I would suggest not pursuing a MSCS at DigiPen. 1. Because its usually not a good idea to get a masters the same place as your undergrad. And 2. Because it isn't all that necessary. The majority of the Masters students are from another country and use the Masters program to get jobs in the US.

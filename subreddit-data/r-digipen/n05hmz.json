I\u2019ve heard comments from students of BFA but not much from MFA, can someone tells about the school life there? How\u2019s the classes? Would you choose an art school even though you want to do game art if you had the chance to reconsider?\nThank you!",

I did not get accepted this round, and I\u2019m looking to compare/contrast where I should improve before reapplying. LMK, and thanks in advance!!\n\nDM me!",

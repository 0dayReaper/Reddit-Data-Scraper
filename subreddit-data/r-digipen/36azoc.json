            "comment": "Not a master student here but it is definitely focused on graphics and engine programming. Since DigiPen is a game development focused school there probably isn't a huge emphasis on server side programming, or at least I don't hear the master students talk about it much. There isn't a specific class for server programming in the course sequence.\n\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/academics/degree-programs/computer-science/\n\nYou can always contact the school from this page and get official info though.\n\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/academics/degree-programs/computer-science/overview/\n\nThere is a \"request info\" button on the right sidebar.",

    "postText": "The website states that the four prescribed direct observation drawings should be drawn \"from real life (not from images or photographs)\". \n\nBut the thing is, how could they be able to tell whether or not it was drawn from a photograph? Would they be suspicious if it was just \"too good\"? And as for the self portrait, how am I supposed to draw it from life in the first place? The only way I could draw myself without using a photo is by drawing on my bathroom sink in front of the mirror. ",

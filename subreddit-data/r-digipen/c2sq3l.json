I'm starting in the BFA program and wanted to minor in game design, as it says you can minor on their website. But when I talked to jazno he said there isnt really a formal minoring program and that I wouldnt have room to take very many courses outside of my program so now I'm really confused. Can anyone offer some clarification on the matter?",

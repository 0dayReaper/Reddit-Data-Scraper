Also are you allowed to stay the night elsewhere for a day or two?\nI have some family that will be coming over before classes start that I haven't seen in a while and was just curious if this was technically allowed :)",

Ask your roommates and see if they're cool with it, otherwise there aren't any problems with that.\n\nNo curfew, but you shouldn't be making too much noise past 10pm, as you'll have neighbors.",

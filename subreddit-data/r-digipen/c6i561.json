The footnote I leave though is that you're paying for the environment, not the classes.  The classes are great for the first couple years, but by the end you learn WAY more in your personal projects then you do in classes.",

I have practiced game design and other programming tasks for the past 6 years. \n\nWhat exactly do you mean by toxic practices? I'll be learning more about computer science and game programming, so what are the odds I'll have fun?",

The workloads are huge and no matter what they say the rubrics are stacked to reward unreasonable amounts of work in the time given. A lot of the faculty are against this, but the admin love the idea of trial by fire and killing off the weak so the faculty that perpetuate it are encouraged.",

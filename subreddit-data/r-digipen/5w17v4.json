            "comment": "Congrats on the acceptance!\n\n&gt; How it is like to study there?\n\nThe MSCS group has its own room, which can be good or bad.. but I found it generally good. Acquiring artists for your projects can be a little tough though because of this. Try to socialize with the undergrads and MFA students.\n\nMany of the early graduate level classes are effectively two undergrad classes smashed together. The later ones, particularly those within your specialization offer a decent dive into the material.\n\n&gt; Job or Internship opportunities..\n\nThere are on-campus jobs available, but I would generally recommend against using this unless your time management or classwork skills give you plenty of extra time.\n\n&gt; How it is like to do team projects?\n\nTeam projects are the main focus, and they're generally well done. You're usually on your own for forming teams with the other students (typically you'll be in classes with mostly MSCS, but some BS students will attend some of the classes from time to time.)\n\n&gt; About facilities, faculties &amp; other students.\n\nThe building is pretty nice, though the elevators run a bit slow. There are lots of windows. Team space is rather limited and you will be potentially competing with undergrads for space, but the spaces are usually allocated pretty fairly.\n\nFaculty are fairly accessible and usually helpful. I enjoyed many of the professors.\n\nMost students are quite friendly. There are many opportunities for socializing, should you be interested.\n\n&gt; Basically I want to know that how it feels to study at DigiPen as a MSCS student?\n\nI found it pretty great, but you largely get out what you put into it, I feel.\n\nBest of luck!",

I noticed that game's overall look and feel that undergraduates have developed was far more appealing compared to graduate students' games.\n\nCan you (maybe) share your experience in this direction?",

Also, by their Junior year they'd have already made 3 game projects, and in their Senior year they usually use commercial game engines instead of custom-made.\n\nGrad students get to make 2 one-semester projects and one 1-year project and while we're allowed to use a commercial engine, it is heavily penalized.",

            "comment": "I was the first person ever accepted into the MSCS program - but I dropped out about half way through.  I was an RTIS 'Ironman' graduate, and thought it would help me get a good job, but it turns out I didn't need it and it wasn't particularly well managed at the time.  But I kind of chalk that up to me being the first and only MSCS student at that time.  Recently I've actually been inquiring about going back to finish it up, though.\n\nIn my experience - which was about 12 years ago - was that it was just the RTIS program extended for two more years.  The reason is that you're taking all the same classes as the undergrads (With the exception of your thesis class) - and I was even in the team project class with a bunch of undergrads.  However, my focus in those classes was much more specialized.\n\nAs far as job opportunities go - DigiPen generally has a good reputation in the game industry, and absolutely has a great facility and teachers that will give properly motivated students an amazing edge when interviewing.  But like everything else - it is what you make of it.  I have a lot of friends that I graduated with who are doing fricking AWESOME.  Working at Microsoft, Valve, Sony, Amazon, etc - all the big names.  And I also know a few that didn't put the effort in and now can't get hold a job in the gaming industry.\n\nGood luck in the program!",

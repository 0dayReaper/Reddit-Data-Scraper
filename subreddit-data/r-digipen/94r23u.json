    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am BSCS graduate who always wanted to pursue a career as a Game Developer. I have made some games in my B.S as well (Just some simple ones but experiemented with different things - Networking, A.I, Mobile Games). After my Bachelors degree I decided to look for game design/development courses and came across Digipen. I loved most of their courses but I'm a little skeptical about the Masters course. I have read some other posts (here at reddit) that the Masters students are not given the same preference as the Bachelors students. Is this true? To be honest I too like the Bachelors in Game Design or Real Time Interactive Simulations program.\n\nBut with Masters there are not that much courses to get in depth knowledge from. I was thinking of doing a Bachelors again from Digipen but this would be a tough decision and almost impossible to convince my parents about this. So can you guys please tell me the pros and cons of both the Programs?\n\nI want to mention that I'm really passionate and if there's a possibility that I'll be good in a Master's program and still produce 3-4 Quality Game Projects then I think Masters is a good choice. More over, is there a possibility that I can finish up my BS in Game Design or Real Time Interactive Simulations program in 2-2.5 years? Transferring some of my credits from my BS Degree. P.S I am an international student. Thanks in advance! :)",

            "comment": "I had the exact same dilemma and learned that combining the programs is possible.\n\nAfter raising these exact concerns with the school, I arrived at the option of doing a year in RTIS and then switching over to the MSCS program. This gets me an extra GAM project plus the chance to fill in a few holes from my first CS degree, and the school was surprisingly accommodating about it. See if you can set up phone meetings with admissions and the relevant program directors.\n\nThe MSCS program is meant to cover RTIS's specialized content (graphics and game engine work) in the first year, and then leaves the second year to go beyond a typical RTIS degree. A key differentiator is that MSCS assumes you already have physics, calculus, linear algebra, and your gen-eds down pat. Keep in mind that many of the undergrad courses are designed to be taken concurrently with 4-6 others; the core MS courses are \"accelerated\" versions of them that are meant to cover the same amount of content in a more intense way. CS 525, for example, is equivalent to CS 120+170+225.\n\nI've been told that finishing RTIS in 3-3.5 years is the absolute fastest you can expect, given a complete CS degree to transfer in, because doing all four levels of the GAM sequence is crucial to earning the degree, multiple GAM levels can't be done concurrently, and transfer credit is unlikely for anything beyond GAM 100, if even that. YMMV of course; your request is unusual enough that you should seek authoritative answers from the school.\n\nDM me if you wanna have a lengthier conversation about it; I spent way too long looking into this and planning my approach. It's nice to run into someone else in this boat.",

I am also an international student and the employment after I get my degree is of concern, so I want to make sure I make the best choice for my case.",

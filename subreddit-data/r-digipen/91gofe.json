    "postText": "I\u2019m currently plotting out my near future and I\u2019m considering going back to school. I\u2019m currently in the Philippines and while I know there is a game dev school here I am wary because of how they handled their animation course ( I graduated from their animation course so this would be my second degree) \n\nSingapore would be ideal because it\u2019s close to home and my parents can visit. \n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t hear much from the SG campus (or the Spanish one for that matter) the only other post on this subreddit is how the work load and standards are stricter in SG than the states ( it probably coincides with their culture with education in general )\nSo any info on what it\u2019s like in the SG campus especially their culture of balanced work and play. \n\nPs any info on the Spanish Campus would be appreciated as well. \n\nThanks!

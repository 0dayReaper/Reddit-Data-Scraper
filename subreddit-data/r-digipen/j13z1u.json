            "comment": "Hi. BSGD Alum here.\n\nBear in mind it's often more than advertised because of the amount of people who need to take summers or do 5yrs to graduate, which ramps up the cost.\n\nI don't think I can recommend it if you're not going into a CS program. It just doesn't provide enough $ value to pay its cost otherwise. Nothing against the other degrees - the design degree is probably best-in-industry, and the artists and musicians are generally quite talented, but those jobs are underpaid and incredibly competitive in the real world, so the cost vs. value doesn't add up IMO.\n\nI also can't recommend it if you're going into debt to do it - there are too many people I know who're deep into debt that's going to affect the rest of their lives and who didn't graduate, so they can't find their way into a high-paying job to be able to pay it off. This is one of the really few ways you can permanently fuck up your life, along with bodily harm, having a baby too early, and felonies, so don't do it. Go somewhere cheaper and with a higher % graduation rate if you're going into debt.\n\nIf you're going into CS and it's your parents' money, then yes, I think it's +EV. Like any investment, there are risks, but it's generally going to return more money than it costs over the course of your career.",

            "comment": "Hello, I'm also a BSGD alum (2012). I agree with TehBrawlGuy. Even when I attended the school I came out with \\~$100,000+ of debt. I'm still paying off this debt 8 years later and will likely continue to pay it off at least for a couple more years depending on how quickly my salary goes up. Because of this my wife and I have to wait longer to even consider buying a home.\n\n$100,000 for a degree is insane let alone what DigiPen is charging now which is \\~$130,000 without considering room and board which will bump that up quite a bit as well.\n\nIf you're aiming for a CS degree a state school would likely suffice and you may even find other people who are interested in making games there and do something on the side. Or go to a state school with a programming degree focused on games which exist as well.\n\nUniversity of Utah has things like that. UofU can be pretty cheap too once you become a resident.\n\nI know for a fact that the game studio I work for will at least consider looking at people's applications if they have actually made a game on their own or with friends and not even require a degree so another option would be to attempt to doing things on your own as well. There are tons of online resources for this stuff these days.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions and good luck!  \nEdit: Per toon\\_ace's comment I actually never realized USC was a private school and NOT a state school. Removed it from my comment about state school TIL.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a junior in high school and have been working on game development on the side. I have not decided if I want to do the design or the programming part since I find both appealing. After lots of research, I have found Digipen to become my dream school. I would love any advice I can get for how I can increase my chances of getting in. I currently have a 3.9 GPA, I am editor of the writing club, and I am taking College Math 3 and Intro to College Composition. What can I add to make me a more desirable candidate? I immensely appreciate any advice. \n\n\nThanks,\nAudrey Sechler",

Basically showing that you really like games and that you've been pursuing game development on your own is big. \nNote that this is more important the more art heavy you go (Design, etc) and GPA/math skills are more important for the programming degree. \n\nTruth be told it's not the hardest school to get into if you have a good GPA and can write a nice essay, so you're probably good. \n\nLmk if you have any other questions.",

If anything it's metric fuck ton of writing design documents and such, so you'd be in a good spot. \n\nSince you're interested in programming as well, I'd potentially look at BSCSGD, the Comp Sci Game Design degree.",

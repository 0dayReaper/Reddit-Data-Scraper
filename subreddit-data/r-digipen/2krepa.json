The only way we're note getting a somewhat recent build is if they both go down at the same time. And I'm planning on adding three more backup locations in the next couple weeks, and automating the process.",

I'm going to have a personal web server for at least a few months, I figure I might as well use the bandwidth for something. Currently we're using BitBucket and Gthub. Both on private of course. I'll be adding Visual Studio Online, a personal GitLab repo, and Digipen once I get the whole process automated. ",

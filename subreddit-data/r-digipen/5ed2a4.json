What things should I be doing now to make the most out of my first year? Is the housing application worth? Etc etc etc\n\nAlso big shout-out to this subreddit. You guys were really helpful in my decision making process.",

I pay ~$650 a month to live in a 3 br with 3 people total and I live in the adjacent complex to the student housing. (I'm literally 0.1 km from them) Go find some other students on the facebook group or wherever and have them rent a place with you near DP. Shadowbrook, Trailwood, Gates, Summit, Olde Redmond, Avalon are all within a 30min walk/5min drive.\n\nLearn some linear algebra before you get here, and buy a TI-Nspire with CAS. MAT140 eats freshmen and if you fail it your entire course sequence gets wrecked.",

If you can afford it, start out there, find some friends and move into another apartment in Redmond. In my class we had many students who would split rent on houses as well. \n\nWhile I can't speak to the RTIS program, I can speak on Redmond. It's a great city and while there's not a lot of nightlife, it's fun to explore. I suggest getting/bringing a bike because it will come in handy getting to the campus (it's on a long road away from most public transportation) and will work on the multiple bike trails around town. When I was there years ago, parking was a problem and I'm guessing it's still bad now.  \n\nAlso, molly moons has the best icecream, and I also suggest going to Seattle in your free time to eat a bag of dicks.",

It's also a great opportunity to meet other people in your cohort and start making friends.\n\nI'd almost go so far as to suggest hunting people down here on the subreddit and just ask general stuff. Honestly I can't count the amount of times where in the labs, I've gone up to random upperclassmen (well not completely random, but definitely not even on an acquaintance level) to ask for help on assignments. You learn a lot just talking to people, and it's best to work on that skill now (the skill of not being scared to ask people who are effectively random strangers). ",

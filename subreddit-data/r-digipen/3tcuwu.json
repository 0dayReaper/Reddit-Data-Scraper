You ideally want to transfer in as many classes as possible, focusing on the harder ones first (math, physics).\n\nETA: You should also try to actually get your associates before attending DP, as having a degree will increase the number of credits you can transfer in. It goes from 15 credits (~10% of degree) to 25% of the degree.",

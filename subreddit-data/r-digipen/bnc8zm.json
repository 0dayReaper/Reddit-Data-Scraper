Unless com sci is significantly different from the other BS degrees I'd imagine you'll mostly be working with C and C++ which are a bit lower level than java is. That's what it looked like in the curriculum I was looking at. Obviously learning more about programming languages only helps though... to an extent.\n\nFor 2.\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/sites/default/files/public/docs/digipen-course-catalog-2018-2019.pdf\n\nCourse Description:\nThis course introduces modern microprocessor architectures.\nTopic areas include computer architecture, modern assembly\nlanguages, and writing assembly-language programs. Emphasis\nis placed on using assembly language to optimize high-level\nlanguage programs.\n\nSo it looks like you'd be learning more about assembly.\n\nCS100 also has a bit of assembly.",

Perhaps some, for the CE students, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLanguages here are C/C++ for all CS degrees, SQL for the databases classes, assembly for the low-level programming classes, and C# if you're doing Unity stuff. Artists learn Python for Maya, but the CS degrees don't really touch it.",

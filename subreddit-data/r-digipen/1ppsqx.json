            "comment": "Most of the teacher's at DigiPen are very solid. They are all very experienced in their topic and are all good teachers. In general the teachers are very strict which is usually the norm for college professors.\n\nAs always, what each student learns is absolutely dependent on how much that student puts towards their education. If you follow every piece of instruction then you will learn more from DigiPen than most places. There is a surprisingly deep wealth of knowledge here and I have found myself learning many things I never expected to learn. (Psy class is a good example)\n\nWhen considering job opportunities you need to realize that DigiPen is much less a college, much more a gauntlet. IF you graduate from DigiPen I guarantee you 100% that you will find a job. They have reverse work and job fairs where students set up booths and the employers walk around to see what interests them. The last work fair last year featured 3 student booths and over 90 employers showed up. Getting a job is easy, graduating from DigiPen... Not so much.",

It's a big financial investment, too. \n\nI'm a BFA graduate, but I was one of the ones who managed to get a job. I'd say about 60% of my class got jobs. I make 47,000 a year, and my loan payments are about 700/month. After taxes, I take home about 2300 a month so that 700/month payment is a lot. \n\nIf you can afford the tuition and you're a hard worker, go for it. If you're financing with loans, go to another school. Seriously. ",

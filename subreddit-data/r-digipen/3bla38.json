    "postText": "Hello Everyone! I am going to be at the pre college program this July so I figured I could ask a few questions from people who have been in the program or are enrolled in the college right now! \n\nI will be a senior this year and I the only college I have been wanting to go to since 8th grade was digipen I took a tour there during the summer and it looked awesome.\n\nAnyways for my questions and thank you if you answer some for me!\n\n1: does the pre college program get in your way of work since you have a lot more people at the campus?\n\n2: will the program help me with getting into DigiPen? \n\n3: Do some of you help the people taking the program on your spare time? I would love to meet with people who are in the same major that I want to go into (BAGD)\n\nThanks again for looking or answering I really appreciate it.\n\nSorry if this is breaking rules I'm on mobile and the sidebar won't load for me",

            "comment": "1) It most certainly did when I attended. It was nice having a laptop for that reason. It didn't bother me much though. Suppose having been an assistant at the ProjectFun stuff one year made me get used to it. Plus I just tossed on some headphones and drowned out the noise.\n\n2) At the very least it will expose you to things that you will do at the school on a daily basis. It will just potentially be more hectic.\n\n3) Pretty much all the projectFun teachers are DigiPen students as far as I know. That might have changed since I attended, but I doubt it.\n\nWhile you asked for nothing more I will warn that you should be absolutely certain that you want to go into the BAGD program. BAGD is a very narrow focus and requires a lot of hard work and potentially a natural feel to game design. A job that simply expects a pure designer type is tough to come by. I'm not saying they don't exist, I'm saying they are tough to get into because you're competing against people who have tons of experience in game development. (I say game development because it's not just other designers that are seeking those jobs)\n\nA key thing to figure out is what you want to do in the industry. Are you wanting to design the layout of a level? How about crunching numbers to create a new unit for a heavily stat based game?\n\nIf you said yes then BAGD may be the right fit, but you may want to consider other options to broaden your job opportunities. If you said no, then describe what you are wanting to do and I bet the people who frequent this forum(including me) can point you in a better direction.\n\nDigiPen is also extremely expensive and there are other schools that offer degrees in game development. No idea how expensive they are, but its something to consider if you haven't yet.\n\nBeing in massive amounts of debt after graduating can be hectic, even years after graduating. And while some parts of the industry may be stable, there are many companies that are still quite volatile and are prone to large layoffs.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions. I graduated in 2012 from the BSGD program and now work for a AAA studio. It was a tough climb but I feel that it was worth it to me. Debt still sucks though, haha\n\nEDIT: Corrections",

I know there are places were you can learn coding for free I just haven't put in the time to learn it. I'm just not sure if they will use c++ or java or maybe something different. I'm also not very good at math and I know that it will involve a lot of math but I'm hoping that since it's coding I will go in trying to learn it rather than in high school where I really didn't want to. I really love games and I really want to make games that people will love. \n",

                            "comment": "You are welcome.\n\nProgramming is a key component of game development. Games at DigiPen, at least the ones that the BSCSRTIS are working on, are typically written in C++.\n\nMath is also important and something you should try not to shy away from. It will only make things harder in the future when you're looking for a job in the industry if you do.\n\nOther than being a producer/designer type I can't think of much where you wouldn't deal with numbers in some way in the game industry.\n\nI would say you should look into taking a programming class if you haven't yet. Doesn't really matter what the programming class is for. Could be in Java or some other random higher level language. You'll at least have a feel for that kind of stuff.\n\nIf you're more focused on the art side of things I would suggest pursuing the BFA program or looking at other schools that offer similar programs as a BAGD doesn't do too much with art(I think around 4 classes worth of art).\n\nOh, and one thing to consider. I was talking to my lead the other day about this exact thing and he was saying that what he really cares about when he looks at somebody's resume is more about their experience with games rather than the education that person received(Sort of how it goes in any industry, but it's doubly so for game development). I know many other people have this viewpoint as well. Just realize that an education in game development is not the only way to go about getting into the industry and your employability will probably rely more on what you made at DigiPen rather than the piece of paper that said you graduated from there.\n\nI also suggest that you pick up a game engine or modding tool and just start making content. Doesn't matter what the content is, just make stuff. You'll learn so much about game development that you'll know for certain whether you want to make a career out of it or not.",

I know for certain that many can be downloaded from the same system that you get the Unreal 4 engine from(I'm sure that will help immensely when getting used to something as complex as unreal). Also consider something less complex like [gamemaker](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio) or some other 2D engine. 2D games are considerably easier to make. I suppose design-wise not so much, but programming a 2D game is leagues easier than a 3D one. Definitely look into both of those things when you have the time.\n\nI wish you good luck!\n\nEDIT: Adding Link",

I help a lot of the BAGD freshmen out, and so I know that generally they tend to have the most trouble with GAT and GAM. GAT is much harder to prep for, so I would focus on GAM. \n\nAssuming nothing changes, (the programs are always in flux) your first year, you will be expected to make a small game with a team of 2 other BAGDs in about 4 months. This is not that difficult in itself, as I'd wager most senior BAGDs could pass it by themselves in a week, but it's a sticking point for a lot of people who aren't comfortable programming and learning technical skills. \n\nWhile you'll have to use Zero, DigiPen's proprietary engine, for your first semester game, I'd recommend learning Unity before you come if you can. It has a lot of resources, and it's pretty beginner friendly.  It's very similar to Zero, so there's a lot of transfer, and depending on what you do, you can potentially work in Unity every semester after that. \n",

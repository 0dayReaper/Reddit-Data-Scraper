    "postText": "I'm currently a rising senior in high school, and I've been considering digipen as a possible school.  I want to get a degree in computer science, but I am worried about how companies outside of the game industry see digipen degrees.  Does digipen's computer science degree give me the same qualifications as any other computer science degree would, or does it only qualify me to work in the game industry?",

            "comment": "2019 BSCS grad here, just started working at Microsoft. The rest of my game team are at Amazon and Google and some of my friends are even in the games industry. Turns out there are way more jobs that often pay better outside of games and they're all happy to hire competent programmers. The DigiPen name has varying reception though, I've heard amazon hires a lot of DP grads and I know one of the reasons I was hired was my new boss saw DigiPen on my resume and has had good experiences with the school. On the flipside I've heard Google doesn't like us because we don't focus on the things they want. If you put the work in and know your stuff any CS degree will do really.",

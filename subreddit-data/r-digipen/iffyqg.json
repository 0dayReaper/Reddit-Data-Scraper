You can find scholarship information on the school website and their are a couple or jobs in the general area. I dont know anything about school jobs.",

I should know since I graduated from DigiPen in 2012 and I'm still paying these loans and they were about that much due to me attending another school before DigiPen. I graduated from the BSGD degree and got into the industry as a game designer.\n\nSo, to put simply, if you plan to go to DigiPen be prepared to be making around $1000+ payment until you get the loans paid off.\n\nAlso be aware that each game industry profession doesn't pay as well as others. Typically people who can code and have a job related to that will get paid more than others but management jobs are also up there in salary. Artists and designers are lower and QA is typically at the bottom.\n\nObviously seniority can play a part in your pay I'm just listing the general info.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nHere's a site that lists other schools that have design degrees. You can probably use it to find other programs as well\n\n [https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-game-design-ugrad](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-game-design-ugrad) \n\nDigiPen is #4 on that list.\n\nI wish you well on your search!\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

When I started out in 2012 I was making around $32,000 at a mid-size studio that was limping along (They went under less than a year after I joined). By 2014 I was making around $50,000 and now I'm at around $100,000 without the need for OT to hit that.  \n\n\nEverything I've said above though is anecdotal.

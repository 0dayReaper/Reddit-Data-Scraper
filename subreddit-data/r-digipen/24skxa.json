    "postText": "Hi guys. I'm Pratanjali64. (I'll use my real name when responding to any personal messages.) \n\nI'm an incoming BAGD major this year, and I wanted to change the focus of this somewhat dead subreddit. Instead of focusing solely on questions for prospective students (although those are awesome) let's get a little more nitty-gritty and share about what we're actually doing (or plan to do) in school.\n\nNow as I say, I'm an *incoming* student, so I don't have anything current to share. Instead, I thought I'd invite all the other incoming students of 2014 (many of whom I met this weekend) to post about their hopes, dreams, ideas and intended focus.\n\n**Specifically**\n\nWhat do you **hope** to achieve while at DigiPen?\n\nWhat is your **dream** job or game project?\n\nWhat are some unique **ideas** you are hoping to bring to the table?\n\nWhat, within your major, do you intend to **focus** on in your time at DigiPen?\n\n**ReadySetGo!**",

I want to see more games that pull players in and bring out feelings such as true joy, sorrow, empathy, etc.\n\nMy **dream** game project would be something on the scale of a 30-hour Action-RPG, but with all the emotional nuance and resonance of a game like \"Journey.\" (IRL a bigger scale would probably water down a game like Journey, but I can dream.)\n\nNot that it's entirely unique, but one **idea** I've been trying to incorporate into all my recent attempts at design has been to start with the question, \"what do I want the *experience* here to be?\" and then try to work backwards to figure out what the ideal method of conveyance will be. And I'm really trying to incorporate that everywhere. Like I actually wrote my application essay by first writing down how I wanted the assessors to feel about me after reading it, and then worked backwards from there.\n\nFinally, I'm hoping to **focus** on making that design methodology work so well for me that it becomes a matter of internal habit, so that I can \"cut through\" and be subconsciously crafting experiences at every level of my work.",

                    "comment": "Last two points look like solid goals. Advice for the first two from me would be this:\n\nFocusing on the emotion of a game is a great way to make a powerful game, but it is also very difficult to do, especially with the excessive time restraints you will have at Digipen. I would highly encourage you focus on something more tangible for your projects because you want your games to be good resume pieces and you want to pass the GAM classes. If you fail to convey that emotion successfully and it is the core of your game, you will likely fail both of those goals.\n\nThe second thing is scope. Scope is how much you can accomplish in the given amount of time. For example, top down 2D shooter is fairly low scope. Add in local multiplayer, scope goes up a bit. Networked multiplayer is a big jump. Then you get to content. One level is low scope. 10 levels that are all well polished is a big jump in scope. How about art assets? A basic bullet, player, wall, and enemy sprite is low scope. If you want to animate the player and enemy that's roughly 10x the art assets. \n\nAnything you add to a game adds to the scope of your game. A 30 hour RPG is outside the scope of anything you can accomplish at digipen unless you have a large team and procedurally generate levels and items, and even then it's very unlikely you will succeed.\n\nDon't take this information as me saying your ideas are bad, because that isn't the case. They are just things that will be unrealistically difficult to accomplish at Digipen. You can find other ways to work towards your goals even if you don't compete them while at Digipen, and then you can finish them once you graduate and have a great resume piece.\n\nThe biggest problem I see among freshmen is the lack of scope awareness. Everyone wants to make a triple A game with a 5 man team in 8 months, and it's just unrealistic. Start with a simple idea like how to move or a core mechanic or experience, build a level to experience that, and see how it plays. Sometimes an idea that sounds awesome just isn't in practice, other times it is, and sometimes a specific part of it is, so you can focus on that.",

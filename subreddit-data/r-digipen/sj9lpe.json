DigiPen works on a \u201crolling-admissions\u201d basis which means you can apply whenever you want, but I\u2019m not sure what that means for enrollment. I\u2019m fairly certain that the deadline isn\u2019t until late spring / early-mid summer, but call to be certain. All the staff is very friendly :)",

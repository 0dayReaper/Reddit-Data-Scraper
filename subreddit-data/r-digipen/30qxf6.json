    "postText": "Hello. I am currently in high school in the southern Washington area, and for a very long time I have aspired to get into the video game industry. I don't expect glamour or ease, but having been a gamer for most of my life I would like nothing better than to help produce something great for people to enjoy playing. \n\nThis college is basically everything I am looking for in my introduction to the field, as far as I can tell from general research. A well-known technical institute with a narrowed focus on game development. I have heard many great things about it (high COA notwithstanding), and the fact that it is a three hour drive from my hometown make it all the better. And yes, I love Portal; that's how I heard of this place. You must be sick and tired of hearing about that, but I want to come to the school not because of its past accomplishments but because of what I want as a ~~scholar~~ student. \n\nI just have a few general questions for you guys so I can find out what to expect from the school and from my time there, as well as if I can expect to get in. Thanks for taking the time!\n\n**1. Do I perform well enough in school to be accepted?**\nI am a Junior. My current cumulative GPA is 3.54, and I normally take AP level classes. This is lower than normal; I was very sick for a very long time and thus missed a huge chunk of my sophomore year, leading to pretty bad grades in the first semester and not the best ones in the second. I also didn't take AP classes this year (except for one) so that I could ease my way back in after that hard time. I haven't taken the SAT yet, I plan to do so in May. I'm not totally worried about getting in - that much I think I can do. According to my research the school accepted ~200 of the ~300 applicants last year, but do you think I have the grades to make the cut?\n\n**2. What kinds of things will I learn?**\nSpecifically, that is. What can the average person expect to know after four years of learning? What areas of game development take priority/are emphasized? \n\n**3. What should I do to prepare for curriculum, should I be accepted?** \nI currently plan to take an AP Comp Sci class next year, but what else should I do? What kind of basic knowledge do I need in order to get started off on the right foot?\n\n**4. How does housing work? Is it on or off-campus?**\nI only ask because I couldn't figure it out on my own. The COA on careercruising.com does not factor in any kind of housing. Will I need to find my own place? \n\n**5. Is it a good school for what I want to do?**\nIs the information valuable to aspiring game developers? Will I build the skills necessary to survive in the industry? If so, I'd like to hear what kinds of good things the school offers. If not, what other schools/options would you recommend and why? Also, I hear retention is a bit of an issue for some - should I be worried about not being able to finish the education?\n\nI thank you again for your time! ",

            "comment": "First year BSGD here, so here's my thoughts on the ones that I can really speak about.\n\n1) Yes, easily. One of my friends got in with something like a 2.5, although he has a lot of really impressive field-related extracurriculars. The essay is a really big deal to the school, though, so make sure it's really good.\n\n3) Learn linear algebra. MAT140 is the hardest freshman class for RTIS or BSGD by far, and linear algebra is incredibly useful. You do not need any real CS knowledge coming in, even for the CS degrees, although getting more isn't a bad thing, of course.\n\n4) Do not do digipen housing. I live &lt;250 meters from apartments in their housing, yet I pay ~$300 per month less, and live with only 2 other people in a 3br, so I get my own room. It's a waste of $3500.  Even if you take advantage of the 9 month lease to go back home for the summer and live rent-free, it's still more than 1.5k pricier for worse arrangements.",

            "comment": "The short of it is that it depends on what you want to do. If you want to become a pretty darn good programmer that can develop game engines, then the RTIS program is probably what you're looking for.\n\n1. Do you perform well enough: Yes, make sure your essays are good, but assuming they are, you should be fine.\n\n2. Depends on the program. I highly recommend the RTIS program just because it's more guaranteed to get you a job. They're still working out the kinks of some of the other ones. I do recommend you speak to students of each program though.\n\n3. Pretty much if you go into any of the programs that aren't BFA, you'll want to study computer science. I recommend starting with C/C++. If you become a BSGD, CS, CE, or RTIS you'll want to study up on Trig and Calculus. If your school offers it, consider taking community college courses so you can get out of Calculus courses. They're about the only ones that'll transfer. (Though make sure to talk to admissions about this first.) You'll also be studying Linear Algebra and it's applications quite thoroughly if you take RTIS, so consider looks at that stuff.\n\n4. They have housing where they rent out apartments from various apartment leasing companies around the area. I do not recommend this. It's very expensive compared to figuring it out and doing it yourself. I suggest just finding roommates and getting your own place. There are of course benefits to the housing, but I don't think it's worth it.\n\n5. Depends on the program. If you get through RTIS? If you worked hard, and have a good portfolio of work you have a very good chance of finding a decent job in the industry. And I'm not saying you need a rock star game like Nitronic Rush or whatever, but you need to be able to have learned real things from your work and show it off. As a designer, you're going to be much more hard pressed to get a job, but if you're good and do have those rock star games you'll have an easier time. Again, I'd talk to alumni and senior people from each program for this sort of question.\n\nRE Retention: There are various reasons people leave. Money is a large one, but also people just aren't prepared for the change. DigiPen isn't generally crazy difficult (I'm RTIS), it's more that there's just a lot of tedium in some classes. And you can't be afraid to ask for help. But you will learn your shit. I will say that I had a hard time my 3rd semester because I didn't care about any of my classes and was just burnt out. That was when I realized I wanted to switch to the more general CS degree which is coming out next year, and that some of the stuff in RTIS just wasn't what I was looking for. That will likely delay me, but I think I'll be a lot happier going forward. (This semester has been relatively great in comparison, but has nothing to do with that change.)\n\nAlso, you mentioned wanting to be a Scholar, DigiPen isn't really a place of academia. There really aren't those types of pursuits in the undergrad programs. I can't speak towards the Masters programs. That's not to say we don't have very smart professors with some serious credentials, we simply don't focus on research. We produce games, engines, and tools for our teams. \n\nThe R&amp;D department does actually do some research, but if you do an internship with them you're more likely to be more of a software engineer.\n\nFeel free to PM with more.",

            "comment": "BSGD Alumni here\n\n1) Yeah, I would say you're fine with the GPA, just make sure you have other people read over your essay to iron out any kinks when you do write it.\n\n2) Really depends on the program though I would hope everyone going to DigiPen would learn the general outline of how a game is really made. Hopefully you're going for a programming degree as that is guaranteed to give you a better chance of finding a job. Lots of competition in the industry for artists, plus that's not including the issues that are going on with that program at the moment.\n\n3) Definitely take a programming class to figure out if you like it. I wouldn't say that you need to learn any particular language though DigiPen does specifically teach c/c++ as others have said. Calculus and Linear Algebra are definitely important as well. I use Linear Algebra pretty much every day at work.\n\n4) They didn't have housing when I attended though I have heard the same as the others. Better to get your own place with other DigiPen students.\n\n5)Sure, it can be. Just depends on how much work you put into it. Also, if you can, live on a low budget and take out as few loans as you can. You'll thank yourself for that in the long run.\n\nAlso, there are other colleges that support degrees in game development so check those out as well if you are really serious about this. Never hurts to see what else is out there.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

            "comment": "I'm an admitted student for next year, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt (like everyone else on the internet):\n\n1. I got in with a 3.0 (high school) and a year of college at a 3.25. I'd say you're fine. The trick isn't getting in, it's not failing out because of the *massive* difference between high school and an overloaded college schedule. Transition from high school to normal college is hard enough, this isn't a normal college. 18 credits per term is **hard**.\n\n2. Depends what you go for. Programs are radically different in some cases, and I'd need to know where your passion is to tell you what you'd be studying. Look through the recommended course catalogue of each program, down to the course descriptions every term like I did and you'll get a good idea of what you really want.\n\n3. CS for CS programs, art for art programs, music theory for music programs, engineering for engineering programs, and start working on whatever projects are closest to what you want to do. You don't need years of college to pick up Unity, GameMaker, Blender or other tools and make something really cool. It'll give you confidence and a little taste of what you'll be doing in the future.\n\n4. Housing on campus is just rented sections of apartment complexes. Housing off campus is considerably cheaper, but doesn't have peer mediation or some of the furnishings. I advocate for a first year of on campus housing, so you can get used to the environment before dealing with housing stress.\n\n5. This, USC, RIT, the Guildhall and maybe VFS are the only programs I would (currently) trust with higher education in game development. Once again though: you don't need a college degree to be a game developer. Come here for the environment and network, not because the education is priceless and unobtainable anywhere else.",

            "comment": "1. My highschool GPA was, if I remember, ~2.75. However with a couple years of community college GPA being ~3.2 if I recall so I sincerely doubt you'll have troubles being accepted based off GPA. Since I'm from the midwest, I took the ACT where my average.. I believe 21? To put that in perspective 20-22 is average (out of 36 points) depending on state. Acceptance rates is 2:3 people that apply. You're fine on that aspect.  \n2. I sincerely hope you're talking about RTIS/BSCS(More or less the same degree with like 10 different courses) otherwise I can't really say much about the other degrees other than job placement rates aren't as great and limited knowledge. As for RTIS/BSCS you're going to know how to program and know how to program with others. Why does Digipen surpass a lot of other colleges in programming? Every class that is a computer science course is a hands on course and meanwhile across the country you're still taking theoretical classes and only allowed to make things as your later years or top performing students. Working in a group is very important and something you need to learn.  \n3. Nothing to almost nothing. I'm serious, don't prepare for programming, assuming you're going into RTIS/BSCS. The first professor you'll meet will much prefer you to have zero knowledge since you may learn bad habits previously elsewhere. As for general education? Most definitely take community college classes for calculus, physics, english, and art. That's one of my regrets, not taking advantage of CC before going to Digipen.  \n4. Do not go with Digipen housing. It's $800 a month to share a bedroom. Sure utilities and furnishings is all covered, but you can easily buy old furniture from Microsoft for &lt;$100 for the entire living room. Rent here is roughly $1200 for 2 bedrooms and utilities, assuming no cable, would probably be at most $200 for a couple dudes, your own room + not restricted to the dumb ass rules of housing for ~$100 cheaper, assuming $1200+$200 split 2 ways. The only benefit of housing is that you can easily meet new people, but at the same time you can do the same if you plan it out.  \n5. Only for programming. You'd be insane to spend $100k for a fine arts degree or game design. Don't get me wrong, they both can get jobs it's just that they're working far harder than they should to do so. Game design is a very limited field + volatile position so it's uhh, in my opinion, extremely stupid to get into. As I mentioned before working in teams is the main selling point of why you get hired. Even if your project is shit as long as you aren't socially retarded, you'll get a job. Now if your project(s) are extremely good then you'll get a job signed off before your senior year. Retention rate is bad(purely talking about RTIS), because quite a bit of juniors drop out due to a job offer. Get paid 60k-100k or continue for another year and pay $20k? Hmm.  \n\nI personally don't recommend Digipen purely due to social life. A lot of people here are socially retarded and it's quite annoying to be a part of this on a daily basis. Otherwise education wise, for RTIS, is 10/10 would attend again. ",

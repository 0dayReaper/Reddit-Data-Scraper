    "postText": "I have just graduated with honors from Clark College. I now hold a 2-year degree in computer support. I am also a member of PTK.\n\nI have been playing video games, and making things for the games I play, since around 1999. My first game editor was DeathMatch Maker for Quake.\n\nI understand the fundamentals of programming. But I am not interested in being a programmer or doing any programming. I have never found any way of learning it, developing my skills in it and mastering it that I can tolerate. I am a visually oriented person.\n\nFor the same reason, even though I am an excellent writer and maintain a blog, I have not been able to stomach the idea of becoming any sort of professional author.\n\nI am not terribly good as a level designer. I have made some interesting things using 3DS Max and Blender. When it comes to modeling non-organic things I am pretty good. When it comes to building things I am decent. I love to build things. I am currently playing Minecraft, if that gives you any clues.\n\nI also enjoy finding solutions to problems. I refer to it as \"Solution Discovery\" rather than problem solving.\n\nI am fluent in computer-ese when it comes to hardware and software. I can figure out how to use even difficult tools. I actually was able to learn the process for building worlds for Uru, and if you know what I am talking about, you know how difficult that is.\n\nI am very good at figuring out features, or how things should work. I once sketched out an idea I had for a game editor. So I should be able to go up to a programmer, detail something I want made, and they should have no issues understanding what I want.\n\nI live in a 40' trailer with my parents. I need my own space, at least my own room. I have no income, no money. I have some Financial Aid available and I should be eligible for any sort of merit-based scholarship. I absolutely refuse to use any sort of loan.\n\nI am passionate about making environments or spaces or buildings or levels in games. If I could just do that for the rest of my life with the occasional modeling project thrown in, I imagine I would be happy.\n\nIf you were in my shoes, would you apply to Digipen? If so, to what program would you apply, and why? If not, why? Is there some other school you would apply to instead? If so, what program and why? Please be detailed in your response, and as up-to-date as possible.\n\nI truly appreciate your help with this. I intend to leave after the graduation ceremony this year in just a few months. I would like to have some sort of plan in place as to where I will go and what I will do.",

This school costs tens of thousands of dollars more than other schools. If you don't have the money already and won't take a loan, there's just no getting around that. \n \n\n&gt; I am not interested in being a programmer or doing any programming. I have never found any way of learning it, developing my skills in it and mastering it that I can tolerate.\n\nIf you can't tolerate programming, that's going to make a lot of design jobs unfeasible for you. It's already very difficult to make it as a designer in industry, and not wanting to program regularly only makes that harder. Yes, there are level design or other design jobs that don't take much programming, but I've seen my level designer friends try to get them, and you pretty much need to be amazing to have a chance. Don't risk your future on a slim shot at hitting a sub-section of an already small field. \n\n&gt;  I now hold a 2-year degree in computer support. \n\n&gt; I also enjoy finding solutions to problems. \n\n&gt; I am fluent in computer-ese when it comes to hardware and software. I can figure out how to use even difficult tools. \n\nGo get a job or further training in IT so you can get out of your parents' house and get a good income. It's a solid field and you seem to have what it takes for it. Do game dev in your spare time. If you really really want to work in industry, go make maps/mods for games. \n\nIf you're dedicated and extremely good at it, you can break in that way.\n\nIf you're not dedicated and extremely good at it, then you wouldn't have made it here (or anywhere else) anyway, and you won't have screwed up your life, since you'll have a steady job in IT without a ton of debt.",

            "comment": "Get over the \"I don't like to do this, don't want to do this, etc.\" mentality. You won't make it very far as a designer/developer with that attitude. You should be hungry to learn everything you possibly can and then build mastery toward the things that you enjoy doing the most. \n\nYou shouldn't be so averse to so many things that you probably have only a cursory knowledge of. News flash, you'll sometimes wind up doing work you don't enjoy, but you still need to figure out how to do it well and deliver high quality.\n\nIf you can break yourself of that mentality, find enjoyment in the process \\(and not just the end result\\), and desperately want to make games more than anything else you can possibly think of doing with your life, then great, go for it! \n\nIf you can't do the above and apply anyway, DigiPen will either break you of it \\(and you should hope it happens quickly\\) or just break you in general, and you'll be left out in the cold holding a fat sack of student loan debt and nothing else to show for it.",

            "comment": "To be blunt - it does not sound like DigiPen is the place for you.\n\nThis school requires a dedication to the craft beyond the particular sub-section you're interested in. No matter what degree you enter, you will have to take courses in things you aren't interested in. Since it sounds like you want to be a designer, I'll start off with the fact that if you cannot tolerate programming you will be nothing but an \"idea guy\" and a burden to your team. A designer who cannot take their ideas and prototype them to ensure they are functional and fun to *before* taking the time away from a programmer to implement your idea, will not be able to do much beyond waste time.\n\nBeyond the above - realistically, I do not even see it being possible for you to afford this school, especially since you \"absolutely refuse to use any sort of loan\". I believe the upper limit cap for both the merit and bridge (the financial aid) scholarships is $10,000, which means you would somehow need to obtain an extra $27,000 assuming you get the limit for the previously mentioned scholarships ON TOP of needing funds for food and non-school things.\n\n  \n",

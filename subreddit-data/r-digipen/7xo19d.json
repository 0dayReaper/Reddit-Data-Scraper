I took 8 AP classes total in high school and passed all the tests I took for them. None ended up counting for credit, but AP Studio Art might have if I'd gotten a 4 or 5 rather than a 3. My school didn't publish class rank and I didn't take the ACT.\n\nI did have an unusual sport that I competed on the World level in, so that may have helped my chances. I was also a WANiC kid, which means I had prior experience with DigiPen and the teacher I had actually wrote one of my letters of recommendation. ",

I'm currently only a junior in high school, so it'd be difficult to tell whether I'd make it in or not right now, but I just wanted to see what I was competing with. \n\n* My GPA is currently a 3.9, and I don't see that going up or down next year. \n\n\n* I haven't taken the SAT or ACT yet, but I did take the PSAT last semester and managed a 1240 on my first try (your SAT score is the equivalent of a 1340, and is considered above average, for reference). \n\n\n* Idk if my school publishes class rank or not, but if they do, I'm 23 out of 154, with 7 people tied for valedictorian. \n\n\n* AP U.S. Government is the only AP class I've taken so far (and my school doesn't offer many). Although, with a 99% last semester and a 98% this semester, I think I'm well on my way to a 4 or 5.\n\n\n* Admittedly, I haven't done many extracurriculars. I'm a Teen Court Peer Juror, which is pretty notable, but not at all relevant to art. \n\n\nWith all that in mind, what would you say my chances are? I know it's hard to tell, but I'd still appreciate your opinion. ",

If you can write a killer essay about why you love art and need to be in the BFA program, that's the ticket in. The head of the program loves people who actively seek out ways to improve themselves.

I've been looking for examples of prior applicants' portfolios but I couldn't find any (until now lol). \n\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, do you think that running start contributed to your getting accepted?

It's funny to see this posted online after being there two weeks ago.\n\nWasn't a big fan of this presentation. There were a lot of technical issues, all of the previous presentations we did were on a simple little pc on the floor in a smaller room, where we could access the computer when tech issues arose.\n\nThe audio randomly shat out earlier on, the controllers, I thought the team using them had tested before the presentation, also magically got unplugged from the cabinet. Tabbing out of fullscreen games also did some weird stuff with the video source. I guess that's just how it goes.\n\nJust defending some of the shittiness of this video, not that you shouldn't expect default shittiness from high school level students. It's fun to watch people wave the microphone around like a magic wand instead of using it.\n\n\n\n\n^^^also ^^^I ^^^really ^^^don't ^^^like ^^^using ^^^Zero.",

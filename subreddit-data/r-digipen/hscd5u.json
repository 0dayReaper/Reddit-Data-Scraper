    "postText": "I am high school student who want to come here. As far as I know, there are many majors involved in game development. Most majors develop three projects over a four-year period. When carrying out these projects, do design majors, art majors, and CS majors team up to develop? Or do students in their major develop among themselves? And how the project goes.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2016, but I presume it's still similar to this. My major was BSCSGD. At the time, BAGD, art, and sound stayed more isolated for the first year or two, while BSGD and RTIS worked together from the very start.\n\n- Freshman Year, 1st semester: We had a team of 3, one of which was BAGD. No audio or art majors, so our art sucked and we used a sound library.\n- Freshman Year, 2nd semester: Team of 4, only BSGD and RTIS majors. Audio was still from a library, art we did ourselves although many artists did help teams in unofficial capacities. There may be more official support for this now, as artists were super overworked at the time and they wanted to do something about it.\n- Sophomore Year: Team of 4. Pretty much the same as the last project, but for a whole year.\n- Junior Year: Teams expand here. Some teams get artists and sound designers. Team sizes grow too. The largest I remember was around 10 and included basically every major.\n- Senior Year: Same as junior year, but even more teams are collaborating. Our team had 11 people. 2 fulltime devs, 2 mixed dev/design/pm, 1 fulltime designer, 2 composers/audio, 4 artists doing animation, environment, modeling, etc.\n\nIn all of these cases, it was up to us to form our team. By junior year, many people were being recruited based on reputation and past projects to form some of the larger, more successful teams. I found that working towards joining some of these bigger teams was the most accurate experience to being on a professional game dev team, but you do need to be careful that your team can stay organized at that scale, and we didn't have many resources from teachers or classes to help with this at the time.",

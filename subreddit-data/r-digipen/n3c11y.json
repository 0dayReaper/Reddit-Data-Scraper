    "postText": "So I got offered a place in Digipen Singapore for Bachelors in User Experience and Game Design (BAUXGD) which from what I know it\u2019s basically the BAGD with a name change and that content wise it\u2019s still mostly the same.\n\nSo I was wondering about the employability aspect of such a degree. Since the game industry in Singapore is rather small and the chances of getting a game design job is pretty low. \n\nWhich doesn\u2019t really matter all that much to me tbh while I do enjoy games and have some experience making them. After doing so I understood that while it\u2019s fun it not really meant for me in the long run. And that I much rather be a UX Designer instead which is in higher demand too (I think?) \n\nBut Im just wondering to alumni\u2019s of the BAGD what are you or your peers working as now? And how likely can I get employed if I manage to survive digipen?",

BAGD is one of the hardest degrees to find work as, but that said, it is very doable, and over 50% of my BAGD friends have found work as game designers, although it's definitely a lower percentage than other degree programs. I know a lot of BAGDs at AAA companies, and many more are working at smaller studios and startups.\n\nIt sounds to me like your biggest struggle will be finding employment that is either in Singapore, or can sponsor a Visa. To be frank you are highly unlikely to have your visa sponsored straight out of school, so would probably need to get a lot of experience locally before trying. I am not a visa expert and am not sure what other options are available to you. But expecting your pool of possible employers to be limited to Singapore out of school is probably correct. You are also correct that UX design is more hirable than game design, and is probably your best way into the industry if you get a BAGD type degree.",

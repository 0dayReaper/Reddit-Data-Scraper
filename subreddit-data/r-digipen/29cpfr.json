    "postText": "I'm going into my final year of high school and was really looking into Digipen as my college of choice. I have a few questions I've been wanting to ask someone for quite sometime now and thought this would be helpful.\n\nFirst of all, I'm looking to pursue a career in concept art or something similar to it. I've been considering the BFA, maybe even the MFA of Digital Art and Animation. However, I'm extremely worried about the workload... I have heard that Digipen's art program 'breaks' students in a way. Is this true? I understand that art programs are demanding but I don't want to fear attending for my mental health, you know? I do have anxiety problems and was wondering if there were any ways to relieve my stress even though I may have little to no spare time. \n\nI have also been researching scholarships in my spare time and was wondering if Digipen accepts any scholarship and/or grant like other universities. \n\nSpeaking of money, how does the financial aid work there? Will they do student refund checks, help with supplies, or just give a few breaks here and there that I'll have to pay back? \n\nAs for the housing, I live in Michigan and will have to move clear across the country to attend Digipen. Does Digipen have a dorm area of their own or do they rent out apartments? Would I be able to afford attending as a very low income person? If not or bordering the maybe mark, are there any suggestions as to what I should do for this problem?\n\nI really appreciate any responses so thank you for taking the time to read and/or respond!!",

I know that I have a dream and a passion and I'm ready to accomplish it with the aid of DigiPen. I'm sure DigiPen will take any kind of money from any scholarships or grants. Finical Aid is something you'll hopefully learn about from your high school, presumably during your senior year they will push students to learn some of these things like loans and scholarships. Loans are what a majority of college students use which will just be paid back with interest eventually. I don't know your person finical status but I'm sure you'll find a way, also research FAFSA! DigiPen does include housing but for only incoming freshman. Eventually you'd hopefully find a place to stay. and ill try to help with any other questions.",

It's fine that you don't know the course load or anything of that sort yet, but with the sound of your drive, I'm sure you'll make it through just fine! \n\nMy school has been pushing for FAFSA but I can only fill it out this next year... I have no idea how much it can do for me, but I'm assuming enough to at least pay for general supplies. I'm pretty sure I'll have to take out loans, but as long as I can attend and make a career out of this, I'm happy. \n\nThe housing is rather expensive and I'm from a very low income family as said before. I'm just scared of not having a place to live thanks to that... I have a strong drive as well for a career in the gaming industry, but it's just the money that's making things difficult.. Do you think there will be time for a job while attending?",

It's also not required, so search around for cheaper options early. You can find much cheaper housing if you are willing to live with a ton of other students (and can find someone that has a spot) but Redmond is a very expensive area and it can be hard to find housing that is both cheap and close.  Working a job while attending is very difficult for all but a choice few. You are taking way more credits than at other schools, with a higher quality expectation. Jobs on campus are the best, but everyone wants them so they are hard to come by.",

There's no way I'd be able to pull that off... Do you know what options there are for on campus jobs? I know they have the Bits and Bytes Cafe which I think would be interesting to work at. Also, by any chance, do you know how things are graded there? Is it like a class critique for projects or a teacher grades? Either way, is it based on how good it looks or a 'you tried and I see your progress' scale? ",

Statistically around 50% of students do.\n\nMoney is money, whether it be scholarships or grants, they will take it.\n\nHousing is through apartments. If your budget is tight I would suggest finding other students and renting an apartment, as it is much cheaper than digipen housing. You can probably get housing and utilities down to 500 if you share a room. ",

I take most of my classes at the college level now, around 10-13 credits in the fall this coming school year. I understand I will be taking 18-21 credits per semester at Digipen. I think I will be able to handle the workload as long as I am able to relax at times, just as I do currently. \n\nAs for the housing, I thought that they charged around 850 a month on average? It's still expensive for my budget, but I thought it would be somewhat do-able, seeing they have utilities and everything included, right?",

I would suggest taking a full community college courseload of 15-18 credits and see how well you perform.\n\nThe Digipen housing is about 850/mo, but if you just rent an apartment with some other students you can easily get that price down to something more manageable. It is however worth noting that if you are somewhere else it won't be furnished and utilities won't be included, but it is certainly less expensive if you don't use digipen housing.",

Don't be the guy who just peaces out in May leaving their roommates without rent. Digipen is small, and you can't afford to make enemies. They also will be your future coworkers and job contacts.",

            "comment": "Hi, I just got into the BAGD a week prior and I can roughly tell you what I did for my portfolio. \n\nMy portfolio consist of posters that I design, they were all alright and weren\u2019t that amazing in my opinion. I think what help me the most was the essays that I wrote about my posters. In the essay I mention about my design process, reasons why I apply them and why I chose this specific design theme (I think you\u2019ll need to be expressive and give a good reason why you chose to design them this way). I think what they are looking are students who have passion, because for both my interview and essay, I express my passion for art and design.",

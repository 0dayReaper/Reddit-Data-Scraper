            "comment": "1) I'm a graduate of the BSGD program. So I don't know about the double major. But from what I remember from my experiences of simply doing the BSGD degree and my understanding of the RTIS degree you're in for one hell of a ride. the design courses will suck up a lot of your time since designing a game simply takes a lot of time to test, fix, iterate, and test again. And the programming requirements from the RTIS degree or compsci if you're talking about the new degree will take up the rest.\n\n2) I'm going to say I doubt it, but I have no factual evidence to support it. Most of the game companies that I have spoken to definitely appreciate designers that can program though so there's that.\n\n3) I assume you have taken a programming course, but if you haven't, definitely do that. Probably should brush up on your math skills as well since linear algebra is going to be extremely important.\n\n4) It's tough as the courses you're taking at a JC are going to need to have near identical course descriptions as the ones at DigiPen(that's how it was when I transferred stuff in anyway). So, if they deal with core classes, like math, or programming they will probably not transfer. Might get lucky with gen-ed stuff though.\n\nI'd say you're better off selecting the CompSci degree and I'd go further to say that you're probably better off going to a 4-year university for compsci. Unless when you say compsci you mean RTIS in DigiPen's case. You'll have a vastly better college experience at UW or WSU versus DigiPen. Even if you're dead set on getting into the games industry you can still do it with a compsci degree because, without a doubt, there are people at both of those universities who are making games on the side to do just that.\n\nAlso, the amount of money you're going to spend on the DigiPen degree is going to be insane. If you're pulling loans out for all expenses you're looking at being around $100,000+ in debt by the end of it.\n\nThat's about how much I'm in and I'm making roughly $1,000 monthly payments to those loans. It took me roughly 2 and a half years to get into a job where I feel financially stable enough to consistently makes those payments.\n\nBUT, I do enjoy what I do and DigiPen got me to where I'm at. I just feel that if I had the chance to redo things, I would definitely consider going to a state school. If you have the money to attend DigiPen without having to worry about loans, I'd still say you should consider a state school.\n\nHope this helps!\nIf you have anymore questions, feel free to ask them.",

                    "comment": "&gt; RTIS in DigiPen\n\nThanks so much! I do agree that the tuition for DigiPen is kinda insane. As of right now, I'm considering UC Santa Cruz because I heard they have a pretty decent Game Design program and I'd be paying in-state tuition, not to mention the campus is gorgeous. UCLA is also a great option, but it is pretty tough to get in. Also, did you happen to land a job in the game industry? ",

                            "comment": "Those both sound like great alternatives especially since you'll get a better college experience at either of those schools compared to DigiPen. You just don't get the diversity of a state school at DigiPen. It's as simple as that. If you have any sort of interest in having a social life outside of school then definitely consider one of the schools you mentioned.\n\nAnd yes I did. From the get go I became an associate designer at a mid-level game studio. That studio took a nose dive when all of its projects were cancelled. I was unemployed for a month or two and being desperate to get another job I took one as an AI tester at a AAA studio. Biding my time I eventually found another design gig at a mid-level studio. I worked on a game there until we shipped and was laid off once that happened. Once again I was unemployed for a few months and picked up a gig at a mobile company as a designer. I had next to zero interest in staying at that company for long and luckily one of the resumes I had sent out during my unemployment had caught a AAA studio's eye. So, while it took near 5 months to get processed I am now working at a AAA studio and have been doing so for a little over a year now.\n\nAll of what I have just said happened within a 2 and a half year timespan, heh. Pretty intense.\n\nBUT, I will say that others in my cohort have had the same job since they graduated from DigiPen so my experience is not the norm though I know of others who simply never made it into the industry as well or had a really hard time getting in.\n\nEDIT:\nJust fixed a few spelling errors.",

    "postText": "I was applying for some school loan for my second year at DigiPen, and was a bit worried on whether my GPA would have any serious effect on the ability to get a loan.\n\nI\u2019ve got a 2.74 total GPA for my freshman year, which is a significant difference from my high school GPA, which was a 3.46. \n\nDid anyone else around that GPA have any issues, and does anyone have an idea as to what the average BFA GPA is in comparison?\n\nThanks!",

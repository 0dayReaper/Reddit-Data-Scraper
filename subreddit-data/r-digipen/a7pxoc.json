The site that you can check your decision on is a total fuckin troll and eventually says \"A Decision Has Been Made\", but doesn't tell you what the decision was.\n\n  \n\n\nAt this point I tried paying for something (I forget what) and instead of kicking me out, it let me through to payment so I was 99% I got in. After that happened, I called and they confirmed I was accepted.",

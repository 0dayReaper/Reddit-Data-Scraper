    "postText": "Hey, all!\n\nI applied to DigiPen this year for the fall semester, and received word that I was accepted, and was also offered a merit scholarship. Now, this would be great, but I have to make my decision by April 1st, and a lot of what I've read about the school is... unflattering. \n\nHorror stories about constant nights spent with three hours of sleep, comparisons between DigiPen and a boot camp, people saying that it's a 24/7 job. Now, I'm attending an information session in Denver this Saturday, and I'm visiting the campus on the 20th, but I figure that the best impression I can get is from current students.\n\nThis seems like a ridiculous amount of work, something that would drive individuals into an unhealthy place. I'm an extrovert and I really *need* social interaction with people like myself, and I worry that even if I do find like-minded individuals, the focus is going to be on trying to get work done and still having time for sleep.\n\nMy three questions I have for current students:\n\n1. How throttling is the workload? \n\n2. Do you still have time for social stuff?\n\n3. What's the school-provided housing like?\n\n\nEDIT: Quick note to clarify something -- I did a sem of college after high school to boost my grades a bit before applying, so I already know what I need out of a college environment, I applied to DigiPen as a transfer applicant :P",

Lots of people do it and get 8 hours of sleep a night.\n\n2. Again, that's a time management thing. I imagine you'll have less than you're used to and probably less than you'd like but it's not devastating. \n\n3. School housing is fine depending on the roommates you're assigned. I lived in Olde Redmond Apartments my first year. They come furnished and with WiFi. It's a bit expensive, and you can find cheaper options elsewhere, but it's the most convenient way to go. You don't have to worry about paying your rent each month as it is done as a lump sum. Utilities and internet are covered. So you'd only have to pay for anything extra you might want (i.e. cable tv).",

As long as you aren't doing anything crazy (like taking 3 math classes, trying to get your 100/150 game into PAX, or entering as a BSGD) you should be fine. \n\n2. Somewhat. Don't believe all of the horror stories. Some students are really angsty during 1st term about having any kind of fun when there's still outstanding homework, so be aware that not everyone is aware that socialization and relaxation is a requirement for productivity, but eventually everyone defaults to whatever level they need (or they work themselves to death because they can't take a breath. Don't be one of those people).\n\n3. This I can't really help with, as I got a non-digipen apartment with some guys from my cohort before 1st term started. If you have any questions about off-campus apartments, I can definitely help with that.",

That's all entirely on me waiting til the last minute to finish an assignment(s). I say this all as a perspective of a RTIS student who is about to graduate.  \n\n1) If you do everything days before it's due then everything is fine.   \n2) All about time management. Most of those horror stories are due to people who are bad about it.  \n3) Garbage. Expensive to share a room, you are 100% better off going on the facebook page to get a nearby apartment with one or two people where you'll spend less than what the school wants. There's only two upsides of going with the school housing, everything is furnished and I'm sure it's easy to swap with people early on.  \n\nPlease take some general education courses over the summers and transfer them in. Don't make the mistake I did where I went home for summers and didn't take them. One of the major regrets I have.",

You'll have time to go to bars or whatever it is extroverts want to do on weekends if you manage your time well, but don't expect daily frat parties or other nonsense.\n\nTime taken by coursework is pretty normal really, but where it gets you is the game projects (the GAM courses). These classes are your passion projects that more or less are the reason you're looking into going to digipen in the first place. There are no \"assignments\" in this class, and no required amount of time to spend on them, but if you prioritize \"social stuff\" over this project, you're at the wrong school. This is why most (successful) students spend the vast majority of their \"free time\" at the school. Of course, depending on your definition of \"social stuff\" this could fill that niche anyway, since you're working with a team in a large open space full of people working on their projects.\n\nAlso, try to transfer as many credits from your high school college thing as you can. If you're in the RTIS degree, things like SOS, PSY, ENG, COM, and other general but required social studies courses are a waste of time and money to take at digipen.\n\nBut yeah, if you're the kind of person who wants to learn programming working on long term team projects, and you're dedicated to putting your all into those projects to gain experience and build a great portfolio, DigiPen is wonderful. If you just wanna play dem vidya gaems wit da bros while cruising through your degree by turning in C level coursework, you're at the wrong place.\n\np.s. some of the horror stories here (or on 8chan) are total bs written up by pansies. I saw someone make a sob story post about how overwhelming the coursework was, literally like 3 days into the semester where the most challenging work they'd have to do is bring home a syllabus and log into their student email.\n\nOh, and for housing, I didn't use school provided housing thing, but when I was there they had the \"roommate locator\" which was fine. If that's not there, just ask people in your year's facebook group.",

You'll find that a lot of the people who couldn't handle BSGD/RTIS/BFA end up in that degree, and I'd say in general those people aren't very successful.\n\nOn a more personal level I've found that BAGDs are similar to BSGDs, but they can't program worth a salt (unless they take it up on their own).  They aren't really given any more (practical) art classes and they often lack intimate programming knowledge, so they end up being fairly useless on GAM200/GAM300 teams.  If your passion is in level design or something like that, make sure you have the skills to execute them (prototyping, art creation, etc.).\n\nThan being said, there are some fucking awesome BAGDs which go above and beyond in either CS or Art, and they rock!  But if you go down the route of BAGD, make sure you're self-motivated, because doing the least amount of work possible to graduate with that degree won't make you any good.",

The big difference is that BAGDs don't learn any C/C++ until 4th semester, and never really get much training in it, whereas the CS degrees get C/C++ from the gate and do become very proficient in it. Some BAGDs are more programmer-y. but I would call very few programmers. (and frankly I think all those people would be better off as BSGDs anyway)\n\nSpeaking as a Sophmore BSGD, the primary differences between me and a BAGD so far are programming and upper math. BAGDs don't get calc or nearly as difficult linear algebra, for example. Don't expect to work a technical job if you want to be a BAGD.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1) How throttling is the workload?\nAs a BSGD, very. You take the big main timesink courses of both the RTIS and BAGD programs. Most of my cohort has either changed degrees, dropped out, or is behind, unless they came in with prior college experience. As a BAGD, the GAT classes would still take up a large amount of your time, so it would still be difficult, but not nearly as much. There is a mental health cost associated with coming here for most people, and you have to decide if that's worth it to you. I'd say it has been for me so far.\n\n2) Do you still have time for social stuff?\nDepends on how good you are and how much you care about your grades. If you're trying to get straight As, not really, no. If you're willing to 5-year or take Bs/Cs, yeah, you still have time. It will be a fraction of what it would be in other colleges though. Bear in mind also that the options here pretty limited, and I say this as a fellow big extrovert.\n\n3) What's the school-provided housing like?\nI pay less to live in a 3br with 2 other people for 12 months than I would pay to live in Digipen housing's 2 br with 3 other people for 9 months. That's all you should need to hear. Housing is also where a lot of parents stick their kids who can't really function as adults yet. 90% of the roommate horror stories I hear are housing.",

Though, like most people have said here I never ran into a situation where I was forced to stay up all night unless I put myself into that situation by procrastinating work or focusing too much on my game project.\n\n2) I did, sort of though most of my life for those 4 years was spent being at that school when it opened and leaving when it closed. Thankfully I caught back up with everything once I got back into the real world. Things are waaay easier out here in the real world, even if I have to adult more.\n\n3) Like others I've never heard much praise for the school supported housing. For me I lived with a high-school buddy of mine for all 4 years and then some after graduation.\n\nGiven that you're going for the BAGD degree I will say that focusing on a bit more programming will give you waaay more opportunities when you get into the industry. Knowing how to program is quite handy no matter what you're doing on a game and having an understanding on how a game works is beyond useful. (It has surprised me that so many people in the industry simply don't have a basic understanding of how things work in a game and what the capabilities are of the game engine they are working with)\n\nAnywho, feel free to ask more questions if you have any.

Though it's important to look into how to go about programming game systems as it's not always obvious on how things should be done.\n\nBut that can be remedied by simply talking with RTIS students at DigiPen or taking more programmer focused roles on a game team.\n\nI gotcha, given that you mentioned it, I actually was the designer on Nitronic Rush (though with a team that small most of the team had an influence on the design of the game). Nitronic was an 11-person team in the end where basically half the people were artists. Originally the Nitronic team was 6 people and the two brothers were making the art assets for the car, road and buildings.\n\nA subset of the Nitronic team decided to start Refract after they graduated from DigiPen. They were doing well the last time I spoke with them(looks like they are doing great from facebook posts and such).\n\nI think the BAGD program could prepare you for that. But as with any degree you'll have to put effort into it to get something out of it.\n\nAlso, I work in a highly technical design role and I work with a BAGD grad in the same role so it's most certainly possible to do what you want to do.\n\nIf you're planning on starting a company once you get out of DigiPen(sounds like it?) a key thing to keep in mind is student loans. Are you planning to take some out for DigiPen? Do you have someone who is willing to pay for those while you're getting your company off the ground and start turning a profit? It's typically 6 months after graduation when you have to start paying for those loans. If this is taken care of then more power to you and I hope you are successful.\n\nI took out loans for my entire education (avoid this at all costs) and it took roughly 2 years after graduation for me to get to a job where I feel financially stable.\n\nThis industry can be tough to get a start in but it is definitely rewarding.",

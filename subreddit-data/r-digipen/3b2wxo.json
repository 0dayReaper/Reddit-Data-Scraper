There could be technical issues (pretty much any service that lets you make a email has some restrictions on the character set), then there is the fact that having one of the standardized email addresses allows for a user on the webmail client to easily search for your  school email using variations of your name. This is very helpful when you are meeting and communicating with new people and professors.",

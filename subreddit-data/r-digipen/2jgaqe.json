    "postText": "My original email:\n\n&gt;Hello Digipen's Admission Team, I am a high school senior and have some questions regarding the application process of your school before I pay to apply, for context I currently want to go for a BA in Game Design. My first question is about the art portfolio, can I send mp3s? I would like to send some of my midi scores I made using the musescore program, I am aware that you will not install any games and I am going for a BA in Game Design, but I think these scores represent some of my artistic strengths, however if it's more convenient I can send links to my musescore and radioreddit accounts. Secondly should I send a video of me actually playing an instrument? I am not taking PreCalculus but I am taking Statistics as a math course and this is my final year of high school, am I required to take precalculus for a BA in Game Design? Lastly when should I apply?\n\n&gt;As a final note I attended a college fair and the email on one of the many pieces of paper I got has a different email address than the one on your \"Contact Admissions\" page on your website, so I will email both adresses once so if you come across this same message twice, it is not spam.\n\n&gt;Thank you for taking the time to answer some of my questions, if there's anything else I should know about applying to DigiPen or anything else about Game Design, I would love to know!",

Lastly when should I apply?\n\nNot required but you should take precal if you can.\nApply now.",

Blizzard is a very large company and Diablo 3 had ~8 sound designers on that game team, Starcraft 2 had even less(including a few that were also on the D3 team). Many sound designers are producing content for multiple games as well.\n\nThe studio I work at has 1 sound designer and we're working on 4 different games. Our studio is a ~100 person studio. Another studio I worked at had 2 sound designers and 3-5 games were in development while I was there. Generating audio content is important but it apparently can also be done fairly quickly compared to other game content(not to say that some sounds are harder to create than others).\n\ntl;dr\nJust throwing it out there that specifically going into sound design is tough and lots of motivation will be needed to make it into the industry.\n\nSame goes for designers(any designers, this goes for the art and science degrees) though. Great ideas are not enough, it is just the tip of the iceberg. Execution is the most important thing.\n\nIn any case, good luck with what you choose to do and just remember that the harder you push the more likely you'll work your way into the industry.\n\n\"just keep those feet kicking\" as I like to say.(general football reference)",

Digipen is really expensive, so you should be very confident it's what you want to do for 80+ hours a week for the next 4 or 5 years. You will also probably not find a job for at least 4 months after you graduate.\n\nAdmissions sometimes takes time to reply, consider calling and asking to talk to someone in admissions.",

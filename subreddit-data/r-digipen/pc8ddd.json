I am a little nervous about the CS requirements at Digi, so I want to get a head start taking some classes now, before I begin next year.  What programs will I be using in the BAGD? Any other recommendations for classes to take now that would help me succeed?",

Once you feel comfortable enough, try to make something without the aid of the tutorials as best you can, it's tempting to yoink some code but understanding why it works is infinitely better for you! I'd also just start playing many different games and get a feeling for things you haven't played before or something that you don't like! Then try to find why people do like it!",

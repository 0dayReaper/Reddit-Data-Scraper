I'm not garbage art drawings, but would my 3D stuff be good to add to my portfolio or do they prefer more drawings? Also are there any examples of portfolios out there off people who got  accepted. Thanks!",

            "comment": "My portfolio is lost to the sands of time, but i'm not a fine artist. My portfolio had anatomy problems, perspective problems, everything under the sun - if you're already working in 3D, go for it! \n\nI'd include some basic traditional drawings to show you have an understanding of perspective and form. Also, keep in mind that you won't see a computer until sophomore year. The BFA program is really generalist - I have to take a concept art class as a senior even though I want to animate/rig. My friends who want to work in 2D have to go through multiple 3D classes. The fact that you're already working in 3D is an asset, though. Try to dip your toes into Maya if you can - some of my peers stumbled during the switch haha ",

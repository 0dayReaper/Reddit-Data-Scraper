    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI'm transferring next year after having taken one year of normal university (to get my interests sorted out) and one year of community college (to get all the transfer credit I can), and I was wondering if there is any financial aid specifically for transfer students. What should I be looking into in this department? Is it worth emailing the financial aid office the same questions?",

Many of the scholarships for incoming students seem to be geared towards incoming High School students. But I would say that emailing the financial aid office is a good place to start for finding out more information on this topic.",

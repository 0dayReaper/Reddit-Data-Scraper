Only problem is I have no idea where they are, and the only thing the website is telling me is that there are 4 of them.",

            "comment": "There are no dorms for DigiPen. DigiPen Housing is them acting as the middleman for local apartment complexes. While they do a good job, as with any situation with a middleman, you end up paying a lot more for it. IIRC, the complexes they use are:\n\n* Shadowbrook\n* Gates of Redmond\n* The Summit\n* Olde Redmond Place\n\nYou can find out more about any of those by googling them. Personally, I recommend living on your own in either one of those complexes, or another nearby, like Trailwood or Avalon, due to the cost of DigiPen's housing. \n\nI live in Trailwood, which is adjacent to Shadowbrook and &lt;1 mi from campus. Instead of living with 3 other students in a 2BR and being 2 to a room, I live with 2 other students in a 3BR and we each get our own room. I also pay about $200/mo less in rent than DP's housing would cost, so I get a lot more for a lot less.",

Would you happen to know how big the rooms are for the three bedroom apartments, like dimensions in feet. I want to know how big the smaller rooms are, but can't find how big they are online.",

They're pretty small. I and the other guy who have a small room both use the living room for our desks and spend most of our time there, so we just use the rooms for sleeping and storage.\n\nEdit: Oh, and they're wider than they are tall, so roughly 8 feet high.",

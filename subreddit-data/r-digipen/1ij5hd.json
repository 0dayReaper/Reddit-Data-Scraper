    "postText": "I am going for a BAGD (Bachelor arts in game design)\n\nI Have quite a few technical classes and several of them have dual credits. I just want to know if they are transferable and how good they would look on an application.\n\n\nIntro to A+ certification: Basic hardware classes; learn computer hardware components and history (a second software based class was integrated into this as well after a scheduling error)\n\nCAD 1 (Design process): AutoCAD course with intro to 3DSMax\n\nCAD 2: Continuation of 3DSMax; light work with a vision dome\n\nDigital media and Games: Basic game design using both drag and drop code programs; as well as ActionScript 3.0\n\nProgram and software development: Simple programs made in HTML and Javascript; with some light game design/use of (Scratch)[http://scratch.mit.edu/]\n\nPlanning on taking CAD 3 if it is available next year; which is in depth use with a vision dome.\n\n____\n\n(Going for Core 40 with Technical honors)[http://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/curriculum/core401.pdf]\n\nI have a 3.3 GPA currently\n\nHave not taken SATs yet so no score available.\n\nI have a demo reel with 3DSmax content on it; and will possibly have much more content with the 3rd\n\n_____\n\nNow... for questions\n\nI'm pretty set on this school. and plan on going around the summer semester of 2014; when should i apply and how long will it take to get a letter back?\n\n\nMath isn't my strong suit; and it recommends that i have a B average in calculus; however it will probably be at the c+ to B- range; is it acceptable?\n\nFor the art portfolio (again it is not a requirement; optional for BAGD); it asks for 15-20 pieces; 10 of which are \"drawings\" Does it mean drawings by hand? And if so; would it be possible for me to be rejected due to not being skilled in pencil and paper art?\n\nIt's a long read; please read all of it if you have the time; and thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "So I'm actually going in as an RTIS major this coming semester, and I can't answer all of your questions, but I can answer so,e of them. \n\nI don't know about the portfolio stuff, but I know you can talk to the guy who looks at portfolios (at least for the BA in digital art) his name is Raymond Yan, and he's a really cool guy: Raymond.yan@digipen.edu\n\nAlso I don't know how it works for Game Design, but for Digital art students they teach you from scratch, so they'll teach you how to draw with pencil and paper. \n\nI'm uncertain about how your credits will work out. I know for transfer students you're required to get a B in the classes you're attempting to transfer in. You can contact Asuka Miyahara for more information (if any and what classes will tender and what you need to do to get that done.): asuka@digipen.edu\n\nGenerally you'd want to send in your application ASAP, especially so if you're entering in the summer, however I don't know if they allow that. As far as generally with Calculus if it doesn't transfer you'll probably just end up taking it again. I wouldn't worry too much about it, just do your best. ",

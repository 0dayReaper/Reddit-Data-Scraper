I am thinking about going to digipen because my school has a connection with digipen.\n\n1.I heard that if i am going to major rtis curriculum will be game focused. Thus i could not work at the company that is not game related. Is this true?\nI like games but actually i am more interested at programming and CS so i want to leave a possibility to work at non game related company.\nIs that possible?\n\u203b i can only major RTIS or BSGD\n2. Is this course well known across the developers? Do they think graduates from RTIS is a  good?\n3. When i saw payscales salary table the minimum annual salary was about 30000$ does this mean that rtis grduates initial salary will be like that? Could someone tell the first salary of rtis alumni? If it is true that my first salary will be about30000$ i think it doesnt have merit to go.\n\u203bi want to work in us.",

            "comment": "Hello, the RTIS degree is fairly well known around the US. I imagine it's more well known the closer you get to DigiPen which is fine since it's in the Seattle area which is a tech hub. Microsoft and Amazon have quite a few buildings in the area and Google is there as well along with many other tech companies.\n\nAs for if you can work a non-game job with an RTIS degree you absolutely can but I suppose the question would be why would you go to DigiPen then?\n\nIf you are getting some sort of financial benefit I can see the reason but if you're just going for a CS degree you might as well go to a state university. It would likely be much cheaper that way. \n\n$30000 seems extremely low for a programmer, but it really depends on the company you work for. Gaming companies will inherently pay less than regular tech companies.\n\nBut, if you go work at Microsoft on something NOT gaming related I think you'll easily hit $80000+ coming right out of school. Same goes for any of the big tech companies. They pay a lot for programmers.\n\nI graduated for the BSGD program so I don't have first-hand knowledge of this but I have friends who graduated from RTIS and this is what I have heard over the years.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

            "comment": "RTIS is well known degree in SG too, I heard that you can find a job easier and that the pay is high (more then 3k), you can definitely find a job in a non-related game company too.\n\nHowever, the course is very demanding and difficult. I've heard people dropping out within 1 to 2 semester. Its not easy to pursue your education under this degree.",

Email registrar with the course description from your community college and what you're comparing it to at digipen. Most general electives credits will transfer ie math, physics, english, etc etc. Anything along the lines of specialized course ie for RTIS anything programming related will most likely not transfer unless it's common across CS degrees like \"Algorithms Analysis\"",

Of course this is if you're looking into a programming degree.\n\nFor artists I would ask you to be absolutely certain that you want to go into the game industry and be prepared to work your ass off to find a job.\n\nFor designers I would say that you should just start trying to make a game with whatever you have at your disposal. Doesn't need to be digital either. You'll gain some understanding of what creating a game is like. Digital would be better, but that typically requires some understanding of programming.\n\nAlso, in general, when looking at colleges. Weigh all of your options and consider the debt you will have at the end of them. Be sure to figure out how much money you'll need to make to pay them off. You'll have about 6 months after college before you have to start paying them. That time goes by really fast.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.",

A lot of people go into Comp Sci and just simply hate it. Just do whatever you feel like doing, but keep in mind you may learn 'bad habits' is what professor Mead would say.  ",

Outside of that, do what you find interesting.\n\nCould dip into C and C++ to see how those lower level languages are working. You'll learn those at DigiPen from the ground up so it's not super important to know it before hand, it just can give you a sense of what you're getting into when going to DigiPen. One of the big differences about those languages compared to the higher level ones is having to manually handle memory rather than having some garbage collection system handle it for you.",

For programmers this would be math, physics, English, psychology, communications, art appreciation, acting, and possibly a 3d modeling course.\n\nBe absolutely sure DigiPen is for you. A lot of people aren't happy here, a lot more people drop out in the first two years. Credits probably won't transfer from DigiPen to another school you want to go to so you can't really change your mind down the road without substantial time and financial cost.",

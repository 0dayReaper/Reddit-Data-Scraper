    "postText": "Hey guys, I am looking into animation schools and Digipen looks like it is pretty good. But i'm a little worried about my chances of getting in. I will have a 2.5 GPA by the end of high school and my ACT was only a 20 (i'm willing to retake). Should I even bother applying with my low GPA?\n\nAlso, i'm hearing a lot about how the school is more game oriented,when i'm more interested in Pixar style animation. Do people from Digipen land jobs at Pixar, disney, Dreamworks, ect or just games?\n",

            "comment": "Absolutely apply and take it seriously.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket, however.  It's not impossible to get in, but definitely apply to other schools.\n\nWherever you wind up, focus on getting good, first and foremost.  Really, you have to devote yourself to that at DigiPen in order to be successful, and I'm sure it's the same elsewhere.  The job will come later for those with the skills.\n\nEdit:  When I went, it was mainly game oriented for placement, but the art program was more animation oriented, oddly enough.  They've since added different degrees, and I'm not sure what placement is like nowadays.  Maybe a more recent grad can help.",

I'm also connected to a few but keep in mind that what I say will be anecdotal as I don't know the true placement numbers.\n\nDefinitely apply, never hurts to try! And I agree with TheWrathOfSean, look at multiple avenues you could take. DigiPen is not only a school that will most likely consume your life for 4 years it's also extremely expensive if you're paying out of pocket.\n\nWhen I attended 2008-2012 the art program was transitioning to accommodate more game focused projects for artists to get into. I believe things are steadily moving in a better direction for artists to get experience working on the student games that are produced by the school. (I know artists that were on the team I was on were having to come up with creative ways to utilize the art they made for our game in order to get credit for it in some capacity in the classes they were in).\n\nEver since I graduated I have continually heard about artists coming out of DigiPen having trouble finding work.\n\nI don't know if they are just searching for work that is extremely saturated or if there is another reason for the lack of employment.\n\nWhat I do know is that tech artist are typically in high demand.\n\nHopefully that helps, and hopefully a more recent art grad replies!",

            "comment": "The school does have a focus on games, that being said, art students can choose not to take part of those projects anymore, opting instead to work on a solo project.\n\nIt would seem like a waste to not take the group work opportunity though, simply because you'll be working in teams regardless of industry.\n\nI'd say go ahead and apply, I got in with a 2.8GPA two weeks before classes started. That being said, make sure you want to come here, because you won't be doing much else for the next 4 years. The BFA program is notorious for being one of the, if not the, most difficult programs here, with a 50% dropout rate.\n\nIf you don't want to get into games at all, you're probably better off applying to the other huge amounts of animation programs out there.",

Work hard at it and present something as professional as possible.\n\n\nFrom what I know, no one from my class has a job at 3D animation studios. Some, however, have worked as 2D artists in TV. All of the contacts are in games here, mostly because of it's location and RTIS leaning. This is not an art school like Ringling or Calarts.  ",

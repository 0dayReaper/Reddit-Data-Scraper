But it did provide me a significant boost in my income, providing me the ability to finally pay off my debt.  So, yay?",

They get replaced with bitter, unskilled, or just outdated professors who haven't worked in the gaming industry for a long  time and don't understand any current technological trends, artistic techniques, or game development methods.\n\nA lot of the teachers are people working outside their medium. We have historic fine artists who paint and draw people trying to teach 3D animation, acting/theater majors teaching life drawing, and non-artists teaching concept art. Because nobody good wants to work at this school, and the ones who do either get fired or leave after a single semester once they realize how difficult it is to make a difference in the school's shitty curriculum.\n\nMany new teachers are hired literally days before the semester begins, or during the first bit of the semester. They are given no time to prepare for their class, and that mismanagement is passed down to the students who are expected to keep producing work regardless of the teacher's inadequacies.\n\nThere have been classes where, every day during the entire semester, the teacher was late by 1-2 hours. No refunds or makeup classes were given.\n\nOn any given day, 20-50% of the computers at the school will be offline, completely broken, require critical updates that the students need administration privileges to complete. Every classroom has computers and programs that don't work.\n\nSome of the upper administration teach classes alongside dealing with administrative affairs, and most of said staff is either: late to the class, doesn't show up to the class, or doesn't actually teach well at all (they don't give feedback aside from \"This isn't very good, just work on it more\" and I am not the only person who thinks this).\n\nSeveral professors grade arbitrarily. They select a random number of people to give an random but very specific percentage grade, and then repeat the process for chunks of the class. People who submit good work following the rubric perfectly get bad grades and people who submit poor work get good grades far more often than can be explained by just \"chance\" or \"teacher bias/error.\"\n\nLikewise, many professors leave all of the grading for their TAs, who mostly don't have the training or experience to give as much feedback as the teachers do. Sadly, some TAs actually do a better job of teaching than some teachers.\n\nMost professors assign too much work for the students to handle and also too much work for themselves to even grade.\n\nThe administration employs illogical and draconian rules in an attempt to make people work harder and provide better work (for example, by enforcing a rule that if someone fails any assignment for a class, they fail the entire class no matter how small the assignment or how good the final product that the assignment led to). They also initially declined to inform the student body of this ruled until after they had already failed several students.\n\nThe entire school is mismanaged. Emails are send to the entire student body (including staff and alumni) saying shit like \"You've been expelled!\" and then the staff doesn't send out a follow up \"Oops, we were wrong sorry, our email system broke\" email until hours later. The only reason we get new equipment is because Claude has a new hobby (hence the new million dollar ceramics room) or because a teacher uses their own money and time to provide for the students (animating light tables, for example, which until a teacher stepped in there were enough to provide for maybe 40% of the active animating student count).\n\nStaff don't communicate with each other, and rules/grading-policies are often misinterpreted on a person by person basis, with no two teachers enforcing the same file naming convention, due date policy, grading rubric, or late policy. There is no consistency between teachers and several rules printed on the class rubrics are unofficially redacted only by word of mouth, which leads to even more confusion between teachers and students.\n\nThat's off the top of my head, and also ignoring all of the issues when it comes to overworked students and teachers (like all the kids who had heart attacks and seizures on campus last year), which I'll get into later maybe if I give enough of a shit to actually comment here. Most students are too bitter and tired to bother speaking up but you'll hear all of the things I said confirmed by the majority of the student body who have actually been here more than a year. The ones that disagree are fucking crazy and in love with Claude's scary/uncaring persona, despite that making for an AWFUL personality for a school president.\n\nWhatever.",

Also, this post fixates on the negative aspects of the school, but fails to also mention most of the things that I find made my experience worth while. I'm going to mention them below, so please, equip your +10 helm of listening.\n\nThere are some really great teachers at DigiPen. Some of them are great teachers because of their skill at conveying important information to students, others are just genuinely fascinating people that have some awesome stories to tell about their experience in their respective industries, and a rare few are both. Sure, there are some bad ones too, but they don't cause problems for long.\n\nThe student council listens to you. I was in a terrible class that was literally wasting my time. The instructor was late nearly every day, often by more than 15 minutes, so I brought it up to my student council president. After the semester, that son of a gun was fired. The students discussed what should happen to the credits that class was worth, and as a class we agreed that we should keep the credits since we still did plenty of research and work for the grade, even if the instructor wasn't worth a damn.\n\nThere are always people from the industry being cycled through teaching positions. Since old teachers get fired, or new teachers realize they'd rather go back to game dev'ing, there is a constant influx of new teachers. Some are quite bad, and others are quite good. For one of my classes, I actually had a new professor that worked IT for nintendo for several years. Not only was he exceedingly knowledgeable and helpful with the assignments and material, but he had some great customer support stories to tell. I believe he is teaching both of the nintendo console developement courses now.\n\nIT always has their door open. Whether you need help connecting your laptop to wifi, your workstation crashed, you need special software, or even special hardware, IT will listen. I've made friends with many of the IT workers, and they are always more than willing to help anyone out (but especially me, since we're homies, LPT: make friends with IT).\n\nThe student body is friendly and welcoming (for the most part). We all have similar interests, that's why we decided to major in video games. If you have ever spent a whole weekend without sleeping just to 100% dark souls, or spent hundreds of dollars on MTG cards, or you like to marathon anime in your spare time (Anyone watching parasyte? Shits getting intense!)? Well at DigiPen, that's how we all roll.\n\nThe work environment is intense. I'm not gonna sugar coat this for you, you will probably work harder here than you have ever worked in your life. The important thing though, is that we are all working together to achieve a dream. People don't work hard here because they HAVE to (although they do), people work hard because their friends are depending on them or they really want to see this dream of theirs come to life. Occasionally, you have a grind assignment where you really just don't want to work on it, but you have to realize that work ethic is key. Without work ethic, there is no follow through. Motivation is fleeting. Without follow through, your dreams will die. Every step you take at DigiPen is one step closer towards your end game (oh yeah, knowing what you want from DigiPen is an important thing too).\n\nYou make games. They may be shitty, dumb, broken, or shitty, but they are games. You craft tiny little worlds for other people to experience. If that isn't enough for you, then you're probably in the wrong place.\n\nAll in all, DigiPen is a unique environment that allows those that are willing to put in the effort and time to realize their potential. Sure it has a few huge gaping holes, and you can help to fix them, but in the mean time you're gonna get really good at getting around people trying to fuck you over, and you may even make a few good friends along the way.\n\nTo counter the inevitable \"Ad Hominem\":\nMy GPA went from 2.3(C+) senior year of high school to 3.7(A-).\nI am graduating after this semester (on track for the 4-year plan).\nI have not partaken of the kool-aid, I would be the first to bash on some of the teachers, their pathetically dumb idea of curriculum, or the twice as pathetic flock of students who live and die by said teachers word; I just think the school does work out sometimes and it's not always as bad as it's made out to be(sometimes it is though). \n\nAlso, every argument deserves a half decent counter argument, so I also felt the need to play devil's advocate.",

    "postText": "I am applying for the class of 2019 fall right now and was wondering if anyone had any tips on writing the Essay? What should I include and what do you think the admissions office always see when looking at these applications?\n\nAlso, I can't decide on Game design and Computer sciences vs Real time interactive simulation.\n\nI took the pre-college course in June, and I took the game design track. I found I liked coding and making gameplay more than I did the theory of character design and Narrative. Game design though was fun although we only looked at analog, I liked design board games and the systems that came with them. Do you think the game design and computer science will give me enough coding background to excel in projects, or should I go into RTIS and take game design course on the side?",

            "comment": "What they want to see in your essay is that you have the passion and drive you nerd to actually make it through the program. I talked about how excited I was about the possibilities of VR for the future of games (this was a few years ago now, around the time of oculus dk2). What was cool was I actually got a personalized response from the head of department saying what he was excited about with vr. So they really do read them and pay attention.\n\nIn terms of program, it depends on what motivates you. If you enjoy making the mechanics and the get really bored creating enough levels and content to fill the game up RTIS is for you. If you treat the programming as a necessary evil to make the game that's BSGD. I entered as a CSGD and have now swung all the way to BSCS because I found the part I really liked was the code. The other warning with RTIS is your linear algebra (matrices and vectors) has to be STRONG by the time you get to junior year graphics courses. BSGDs need the math to but not in the same depth. The workloads of both are significant, but in my experience I notice BSGDs tend to be more swamped with big projects. \n\nKeep BSCS in mind too while you're deciding, it's still digipen and games but you get some free electives to get the basics of other areas. RTIS  and BSGD don't offer a lot of flexibility.\n\nJust the 2 cents of a senior who went BSGD-&gt;RTIS-&gt;BSCS.",

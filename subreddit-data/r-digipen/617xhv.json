I have seen that the Graduation Rate from this University is 58% when compared to other universities such as Harvard etc have +95%. \n\nThis is the source btw [Link](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/search/?major=computer&amp;sort=salary:desc&amp;page=0).\n\nWhat makes the graduation rate less at Digipen is the course so hard to complete or do the students drop out that's the reason[If it is]. \n\nPlease let me know if I am wrong. But the salary for the students who attend Digipen is really good on an average basis.\n\nPlease help me out with this question. \n\n\nThanks in advance",

DigiPen's strategy isn't really to teach you that much *better* than any other good school, it's to teach you *more* by making assignments longer and harder. It is very effective, but has the obvious cost of causing a lot of stress/dropouts.\n\nPart of the stats is also that a lot of people drop out to get a job, because if you're being offered a position after only 3 years, why complete your degree? So, even though those people are successful, they technically count as dropouts and skew the numbers.",

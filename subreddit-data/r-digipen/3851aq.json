If you have any uncertainty, definitely consider other options.\n\nI imagine that since you're looking at DigiPen you're interested in game development? To that I would simply say that it's an extremely competitive field and you should be doubly sure that you want to go into that industry. \n\nI see more than a few people that I went to school with who are still in QA jobs and I've been out of school for almost 3 years now. Having a job where you are underpaid and have to pay back ridiculous loans is not fun. I had to do that for a bit and it sucked.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not all QA jobs are low income, but many are and the ones you get offered when breaking into the industry will most likely be that way.",

I'm not even in the industry anymore.  I paid off my loans last year because I started a business in a totally different field, and actually made a decent income.  I'd be in debt for much much longer otherwise, and I went to this school half as long as you would, and paid half as much per year.  ",

Honestly, a lot of the people that attend Digipen don't understand that. The school sells promises to every degree that it'll be alright and you can 'easily' get a job. In reality that's true for the degree that they cared and worked on the for the past 20 years ie anything programming for 4 years.  \n\nTuition has been going up $200-800 every year since they started flatrate ie 16-22 credits are the same price where at 22 credits was about the same cost. I don't know how much it went up before that per credit. Anyhow, if you're worried about a computer, I worry about your choice. Plus it's fine arts where tuition is about 100k for 4 years.  ",

There are *some* things that are very difficult to learn on your own, such as particular program workflows and eccentricities, but by and large I've taught myself far more than I've actually learned from digipen courses. I'd say about 1/4th of my time at digipen was actually worth the money. That 1/4th was *really good*, but again, that's like 90 grand I spend on basically a single year of good education.\n\nIf you think you'd like to spend that kind of money on 5 years of education, then go for it. But /u/athey's original point of \"get a good computer, get Maya (assuming you wanna do 3d animation and not 2d), then just force yourself to practice for 50 hours a week\" is spot on. I just force myself to work on stuff and I learn a lot.\n\nIn addition, getting a job isn't easy in this field, especially for art. A lot of skilled and very hard workers I know still do not have jobs. Some do, and they earned it, but many do not. You are not guaranteed an immediate job, even if your work is above average.",

I don't even know if it's the same anymore - it was more than 10 years ago, after all.  But being at Digipen was two solid years of working yourself half to death.  \n\nIf anything, Digipen taught me to teach myself to adapt to changing demands, and how to troubleshoot problems faster.  Which is basically what you learn anyway through repeated practice. \n\nThere was virtually nothing that was workflow specific that I learned there, that was useful later in the actual industry.  *Nothing* was really applicable.  I had to relearn all the rules because different studios do different things, and they never really explained and important workflow stuff anyway.  \n\nThe biggest difference between going to a school to learn this stuff, versus getting lessons on video/online, is deadlines.   Teachers set deadlines. Teachers grade you.  If you don't have someone to tell you what to do, when to have it done by, and if you're doing a shit job at it, then you have to be VERY self motivated - which is a problem that a lot of younger people have, coming right out of high school.  \n\nSo the real trick to this route succeeding is your own drive and commitment.  \n\nAs I understand it, digipen's art program is totally focused on traditional art for the first two years now.  That would fucking piss me off.  \n\nYeah, exposure to traditional techniques is important and valuable, but two whole years without even working in 3d?  Whose brilliant idea was that?  Oh right - it was Abbott Smith's idea, and that ass nearly destroyed DP's art program with his arrogant superiority complex.  And he was a shitty teacher. \n\n\nIf you want to learn 3d art for games, there is nothing stopping you from beginning right away.  Maya is free for educational purposes - go get yourself that and start digging through tutorials.  \n\nThe Gnomon tuts are an industry standard. When I worked at Sony they would get DVDs from Gnomon all the time and they were in the studio 'library'.  Go check them out first. I think they've got something resembling a structured curriculum too.  ",

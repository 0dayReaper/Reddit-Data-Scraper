    "postText": "Has any graduate or current student gotten the merit-based scholarship from DigiPen that you are automatically applied for when you apply to the school (Presidential Scholarship or something like that)? If so, how much were you given, and what is your \"merit\"? (What were your grades/test scores when the scholarship was determined?) \n\n\nOther than that, does anyone have any other scholarship recommendations beyond DigiPen itself that can help me lower the cost of college? \n\n\nThanks",

Still trying to figure out how to lower the costs myself haha, but I hope this helps.\n\nI got a merit scholarship ( the automatic one ), $7,000 a year for 4 years. As for grades, \\~3.5 GPA &amp; 30 ACT ( 32 SS ).\n\nIf you're looking for additional help, try going for the [ESA](http://www.esafoundation.org/scholarship.asp) Scholarship ( if you're a minority ) when applications are open, and make sure Digipen is first on your list regarding FAFSA. There are also the Scholarships for Continuing Students ( $5,000 after freshman year ) if you don't find much outside of 'em. Can't list much now since I'm not sure what program you're planning to go into, but lots of scholarships are major-dependent ( CE vs CS especially ), so be sure to be specific when searching!!  I personally recommend looking around on Niche.",

I don't recall if I said in my original post and I'm on mobile so I can't easily check, but I plan to go into BSCSGD as well.\n\nThat's actually very encouraging! 7,000x4 isn't bad! Do you know if everyone gets at least some amount for the merit scholarship, or only select people? If it's pretty much guaranteed then I'd be even more confident! Also, what do you mean by SS on the ACT?\n\nI'm only a quarter Korean, so *maybe* I count as a minority. (Other than that I'm 75% white and I'm a dude, so..). I'll also be sure to remember that in the FAFSA. And I'll check out Niche. \n\nThank you!",

Digipen only takes composite scores as far as I know.\n\nI think everyone gets evaluated as soon as they're processed, but won't receive the financial results until their acceptance package arrives or afterward. It took about 2 weeks to hear back from them when I applied, and maybe another week before I got the packet. Not so sure about most of this for others though. This is what I got from an email: \n\n&gt;Our Financial Aid Office will be sending out award letters to accepted students beginning in January based on FAFSA, scholarship and private loan information sent to DigiPen.\n\nYou may actually qualify then! I think a quarter counts as a minority, at least I know it does for programs such as [National Hispanic Scholar](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/scholarships-and-recognition/national-hispanic-recognition-program). Doesn't hurt to try at least. \n\nBest of luck then, hope ya get in (with a decent scholarship)!! \\^\\^ ",

Man every time I gain just a little more knowledge that gets me closer to going to DigiPen (with a decent scholarship, like you said), I get totally hyped. Thank you for the help once again, I hope I'll get to study there one day! (I'll be applying for Fall 2020.. almost there)",

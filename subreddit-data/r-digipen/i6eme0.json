    "postText": "hi everyone!\ni was thinking of applying to digipen in singapore because i heard the animation program there is pretty good. if there\u2019s any alumni who could tell me if it\u2019s worth it or not (as in the workload and so) and if you could tell me if the animation industry is still existent in singapore and getting a job there since i haven\u2019t been in sg for a long time haha. i\u2019m aware of the large workload too so if anyone could put pros and cons that would be nice :)\nthank you!!",

Zbrush? Maya? 3ds Max? \n\n\nWhich would be best for a beginner to learn with? ",

Maya as well as most other software has a learning curb for sure but its the one we use the most often.",

            "comment": "Current BFA here. DigiPen teaches Maya and ZBrush since they\u2019re pretty much industry standard. Max isn\u2019t really used so much, but for non-school work, it can be a personal preference thing. \nMax and Maya are both AutoDesk products so they\u2019re similar. If you learn one, you can pretty much use the other as long as you know the navigation and tools. \nFor sculpting, there\u2019s Mudbox and ZBrush. I recommended ZBrush since that\u2019s what everyone uses. \nIf you\u2019re a prospective student, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019d discourage you from starting with digital, but if you don\u2019t have a firm grasp of traditional media, then I would definitely start there and wait on learning digital, especially sculpting. (But that\u2019s just my opinion).\nAs for exporting your models from programs, they can be exported and imported into basically wherever you want so that\u2019s not really an issue you need to worry about.\nIf you\u2019re not interested in animation and texturing, you\u2019re gonna be in for a rough time because BFAs are required to take both traditional hand drawn animation and digital animation.\nIf you\u2019re looking to apply and want to ask questions, definitely feel free to send me a PM and I can answer any questions you have to the best of my knowledge.\nEdit: spelling\nEdit2: contention",

I'd say my strong points are outlining and proportions, my shading is above average, but admittedly, I could be better with use of color. I was hoping digital drawing would help me with that because I wouldn't have to buy a million prismas. \n\n\nAlso, it's not that I'm completely uninterested in animation. It's just that I'm *more* interested in sculpting. Plus I thought it would be a better place to start, especially if I were to use it for my portfolio that best be done by the end of this summer. ",

You use paint. And you only need 4 paints, and then mix whatever colors you need from those. \nThere are various portfolio review events that professors hold for interested students, so I would look into one of those if you\u2019re applying.

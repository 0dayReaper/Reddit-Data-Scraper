I love games, playing and designing, and I definitely will be pursuing it as a career. However, I'm not sure if Digipen would be a good fit. I've gotten into other schools, including UC San Diego (CS), UC Irvine (GD), and UC Santa Cruz (GD), and I don't know where to go.\n\nMy main issues with Digipen are not education based, but rather school based. I'm worried that I would be limited in options for jobs and higher education by a for-profit school. Credits don't transfer and no one really knows what the school is. Furthermore, the structure of the school, or at least my impression of it, is much more like a business than non-profit schools.\n\nCould anyone give me some insight on this? I know there are tons of variables, but I figured I might as well ask.",

Like many have said, you're living and breathing games, so nothing else really matters. \n\nThe whole issue of the for-profit nature of the school I think does matter, but so does the weather, the area, the bus, the housing, etc. As I said, there are a ton of variables. This one in particular  stuck out to me as it is unique to the schools I was accepted into. It's more of an issue of 'feel,' which isn't easy to quantify or understand. It was more of an indication of isolation from the education system as a whole.",

Stats are still pretty good - something like 75-80% employment in industry 18 months after graduation - but not as shining as CE or BSCS just because the art world is a lot harder to break into. Ever heard of needing experience to get a job, but a job to get experience? that sums it up pretty well. \n\nFrom what I understand, after you land that first job the next ones come a lot easier since you have industry connections that know how you work.

            "comment": "Greetings, BSGD alumni here. Unless you're deadset on getting into the game industry I'd say go somewhere else, and DigiPen is stupid expensive so there is that as well.\n\nI'll be honest and say I haven't looked into what the requirements of getting a master's degree are so I can't really say anything on that front when it comes to pursuing a master's degree with a bachelor's degree from DigiPen.\n\nOutside of the above, You will most certainly get a more well rounded college experience with the other schools you listed. At DigiPen you are living, and breating video games for the entire time you're there. There are of course parties and the like but it's not the same experience as a state school. You also will not meet as diverse of people at DigiPen.\n\nOutside of some art program shenanigans DigiPen is built to supply you with mental and physical tools to build games. A lot of the school is trial by fire and a lot of what you will learn will come from your peers. That's how it was for me at least, I definitely learned from teachers as well though. Also, because DigiPen is purely focused on getting people into the game industry every friend you make there will also be a potential contact in the industry. Lose your job? Call up one of your buddies that works at that one place.\n\nI can personally say that having that network has helped me get a job in the past. Though I suppose you could same the same for the people in your degree program at other schools.\n\nSo it comes down to if you want to be hyper focused into games for 4 years and be around people that have that same mindset. If you want something where you have more room to experience life after high-school and meet a diverse range of people with widely different interests I'd say go to the other schools you have listed.\n\nRight now, if I was looking into schools and know what I know now, I would not go to DigiPen. \n\nBut, for me, it's because of the cost. I'd probably go to University of Utah if I still wanted to do design or simply pursue a CS degree and attempt to make games on the side given the ubiquity of free game engines and the number of tutorials that are online on how to use them. If you can prove to an employer that you can make games and make them well then it doesn't matter too much about what school you go to. Some companies will keep a look out for certain schools of course, and to some companies one of those schools is DigiPen.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the response! I was thinking another option for me might be to try and attend a school such as Digipen for a masters degree after finishing four years at say UCSD. Do you think that would be a valid option, or a waste of time? At the moment I feel game design is where my future lies but accept that I know little and my opinion could change over time. \n\nThe reason I even heard about Digipen to begin with was because of a tour of Survios when I was at a coding camp. I've been working with games since middle school, and am currently working on my own game when I have the time. But as you said, I can do that on the side as I take a CS degree. Plus, there are game design clubs and classes available.\n\nI think a UC would be more of a safe approach, and then i could gauge my interest my senior year. What do you think?",

Not sure what benefits it really gives honestly outside of showing that you have in-depth academic knowledge of game design. But I also don't know too many people who have a masters degree from DigiPen.\n\nYeah, the key is having the motivation to make your own game and actually getting people to test it and getting feedback on it.\n\nArt assets can be troublesome as well, but these days you can purchase them or potentially hire someone to make some for you.\n\nBut yeah, there are also indie meetups in most large cities so you could attend those as well.\n\nI'd say doing a state school is much more ideal. And going for a CS degree is much safer than pursuing a design degree. The CS degree will give you more opportunities in the game industry than design degree would hands down.",

            "comment": "Digipen is a for profit school, but that doesnt make it bad. It just means the school pays for things differently than public schools. The teachers and curriculum are still top notch. I too was recently accepted, so i went to a meet and greet on campus. I was surprised to findout Digipen is the #1 school with highest percentage of comp sci graduates, in the country. Meaning, out of all comp sci students that entered a computer degree, more digipen students finish their degree than at any other school. This, i think, is what you should be looking at. Go to a school with people who actually graduate. You're in high school, and you're worried about getting a job alredy? Like as if employers care what school you go to.\nTo get hired you have to have work that you made yourself. And it has to be good work, at least. Digipen will whip you into shape, but you'll love it, and you'll make great software. So i say go for it. You will be guaranteed a job, not because of Digipen's name, but because of the work ethic the students build while they're there. Hope that helps to describe Digipen, and the reputation they have to offer. I accepted this year and i start in the fall.",

I have friends at other schools that are signed for great jobs, and none of us are doing what we thought we wanted to in high school. Don't sweat the details this far out.

The school does a really great job of getting help to anyone that asks for it, I wish I'd figured that out before getting to higher level classes where that level of support is harder to get. \n\nThe programming courses are the best around and no other school that I know of does the year long projects like DigiPen. Knowing how to work effectively on a team is the most important thing I've learned, and mostly that's been figuring out how to control my ego and ask for help or figure out a better solution as a team.\n\nIt really is a great school, but in order to really get the value out you have to put in the work, take advantage of the resources, and connect with other students. A lot of people don't do that and don't last long. ",

The work and content was very exciting, especially the group projects throughout the years. My main concerns have come up afterwards, now that it\u2019s decision time. \n\nI\u2019ve heard the comparison that Digipen is military school for game design. They know best, and you learn what they say to the point. This is a bit of a mixed bag, as on one end you have a solid base for future learning, building your own knowledge and experience of of that foundation. At the same time, certain processes are built into that base that could be improved upon. This can cause problems with innovation and openness to change. But there\u2019s no way to know how true that is, until those new innovations are created. \n\nAnd in regard to the whole for profit thing, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Yeah sure, I agree that if it doesn\u2019t impact the quality of the education it doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference, but it further isolates it from the overall education system. It just makes it feel risky. But feelings aren\u2019t exactly the most reliable thing in the world, so I don\u2019t know. \n\nAll that being said, I think it\u2019s important to state the goals of this post. I really don\u2019t know what to choose. I started the conversation to try and get closer to a decision. Granted, this is the Digipen subreddit so I kinda already knew everyone would recite what I already heard at the open house, I just wanted to talk more about to think it through a bit more before I make a decision.

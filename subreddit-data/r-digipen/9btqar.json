I also know a few people who never got a laptop and have been totally fine. What I'm saying is it you already have a computer to work on something at home you'll be fine, the lab machines will be fine for the rest. ",

As far as performance, it's been able to handle whatever I've thrown at it, but I'm a BAMSD, so I can't speak to what BAGDs need specifically.\n\nHowever, I ended up also getting a Surface in my second year, because my MSI was much bulkier/heavier/more setup than I wanted to deal with daily.  I just use it as a desktop now.",

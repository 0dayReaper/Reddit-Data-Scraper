    "postText": "My son has been accepted for fall 2019 in the CSGD program at Digipen.  He is wheelchair dependent for locomotion.  We're looking at him living in the school housing, what is the likelihood of student / roommates being willing to be paid caregivers for my son?  Pay would be from state Developmental disabilities administration, there would be paid (online I believe) training, plus hourly for care.  Roughly up to 12 a day but most of those would be at night, you could sleep but need to be able to get him up and out in case of emergency.\n\nThanks",

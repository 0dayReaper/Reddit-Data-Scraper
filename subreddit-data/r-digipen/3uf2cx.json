    "postText": "I'd love to go to Digipen for the Bachelor or Arts of Game Art and Design program, but I think it's financially impossible for me. I'm currently set to attend the Rochester Institute of Technology here in New York where I live, but the program I'll be taking isn't as close to what I want to do as the one at Digipen could be. I want to do level design, world design, environment design, etc, something like that. My first choice was RIT's 3D Digital Design program, but that filled up and I didn't make it in. New Media Design is my 2nd choice. I'm currently set to get those 2 government loans (unsub and sub) as part of my financial aid, and a decent sized grant from RIT. Even if I got this good of aid for Digipen, I don't see how I could possibly afford to live in Seattle. I can't get any other loans due to not having credit or any cosigners. I'm receiving no help from parents either. Anyone have any tips or suggestions that could make this not seem so impossible? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hmm, if you are going the BAGD route I'd say you should just stick to the school that you got into and focus on developing levels for games that currently exist and in the games that you potentially work on at the school (Be aware that many people seek out level design jobs and it can be tricky to start out as a level designer at a game studio). \n\nThe only advice I could give would be to seek out scholarships if there are any and to not fret much over not going to DigiPen. As long as you have the drive to get into the game industry you will most likely get in.\n\nAlso, you would probably live with roommates if you were to attend DigiPen. They have a forum or something for that sort of stuff so you can find roommates before you get into the school.\n\nSo yeah, do things on your own time and that will greatly improve your chances of getting into the industry. Most developers are happy to just see that you have worked on a game before and have a sense of how the development process goes. \n\nFeel free to ask more questions. I graduated from the BSGD program and worked fairly often with BAGDs.",

            "comment": "CS senior with a math minor here. Hugely depends on the class/instructor, but I haven't had to memorize a proof ever. It just wouldn't be a good use of time. The few proofs that have been requested on homework/tests are normally pretty basic if you understand the material. Also, they are nothing like high school proofs. The rules on them are much less strict as long as you only use valid steps.\n\nI will say that there are exceptions to this. The number theory class and a couple of CS classes are fairly formal proof heavy. But a big part of those classes is learning how to prove these things. In some engineering jobs, it is an important skill to be able to prove your algorithm is correct, and that's one of the things they cover. On that subject, taking number theory to learn about different types of proof made the algorithms class much easier. Also, some of my graphics courses expected me to be able to prove things like why a given reflection algorithm worked for example. \n\nBasically proofs are part of math life, but shouldn't really need to be memorized ever. They are more like a puzzle that they give you all the parts you need to solve. ",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the advice! \n\nAnyway that makes me worry a bit, because i have some experiences failed to prove.\n\nfor example, on the graphics programming book. They were the quizes on the page after basic materials and it was \"**prove that ||u x v|| is same as the area of the parallelogram defined by vector u and v**\". I tried, but i couldn't come up with a reasonable answer. \n\nIn cases like this, Is it because like you said, there were some meterials that i wasn't aware of, or is it just lack of logical talent?\n\nSometimes,when i see the answers, they look so creative to me and i realize that i could never solve it no matter how long i struggle with them. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

There are a lot of resources to help you once you get there if the classes aren't getting you there. It's just a different type of problem solving that you can get better at. ",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a CSGD first year getting a math minor. \n\nAs someone who loves mathematics, the DigiPen math department is seriously lacking. We have several hugely accomplished professors who are very weak teachers. I\u2019ve taken 3 teachers so far and two were very mediocre, the third is adequate. I\u2019m talking about coming to lectures with no notes and just winging it a lot leading to lots of stumbling, and lots of not having examples ready and having to waste time constructing good examples. \n\nIn the first math course, which is kind of an intro to Linear Algebra and some specific CS applications of linear algebra, a course which is the prerequisite for Calculus 1 (differential calculus) at DigiPen, there were several homework problems about interpolation that required taking derivatives. When I brought it up in class, the professor gave an incredibly cavalier (and in my opinion, totally irresponsible) quick tutorial on the Power Rule of derivatives, all after insisting he thought calculus was a prerequisite for the course. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re like a third of the class which came in already transferring or having taken calculus, but if that was my first explanation of derivatives, I think my understanding of calculus would be significantly stunted for a long time to come. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m taking Vector Calculus with a professor who is a really jolly and fun guy, who is an adequate teacher. He\u2019s one of the world leaders in a field of upper math called Fuzzy Logic. He lectures fine, but he doesn\u2019t really take the time to make sure the conceptual is there all the time. And he often doesn\u2019t notice students with questions. In subjects like multivariable calculus with things like the using partial derivatives to find the gradient, this speeding through can make it really hard to keep up. ",

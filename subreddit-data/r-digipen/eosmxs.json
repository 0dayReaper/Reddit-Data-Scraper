    "postText": "  Hey, I've been looking into DigiPen's machine learning program, and I was wondering if anyone here is in it already and has some insight? I understand the program is \"new\" - is it \"brand new\" like no one has delved into the program yet?  I think the idea of creating video games is interesting, and I've read about how the project based learning works and all the time that will be spent developing the games.  I think this experience will be useful, but ultimately after college I don't plan on developing video games.  I would like to work in the space industry, and I think a background in project-based problem solving with knowledge of machine learning is a good starting place. \n  Another question - I've heard that it is difficult to get credits to transfer into DigiPen. I'm finishing an A.S. in engineering this spring, and by the fall I will have a shitload of math courses already done. I can understand retaking linear algebra, since it is such a broad topic, and I'm sure that it is taught at this school in a way more relevant to computer science than at my community college, but I'm not looking forward to retaking Calc 1 - 3 and differential equations again.  (A- in calc 1, B+ in calc 2, A in diff eq and Calc 3 I'm taking in the spring). \n  I know it is probably weird to be looking into DigiPen without having an interest in pursuing a career in video game development, but I'm fine with that.\n\nOh and is anyone here doing the ECE minor / major? Any thoughts on that program? \n\nThanks\n Max",

I have a friend who's in it and he's really enjoying it.\n\n2)  Transferring in credits can be difficult, but not impossible. There is a list of transferable credits in the form of AP Tests on the Course Catalog, available on DigiPens Website. Those classes on the list will probably also be able to be transferred in from your AS. \n\n3) It's actually not that weird to go to DigiPen and not want to work on games, I know a couple people who do the same. If that's your plan, I'd either take the BSCS or BSCSML degrees.\n\n4) I believe the ECE minor is pretty much impossible to get but I know a lot of the CE Major students and they really like the program.",

    "postText": "I'm a potential Digipen student, and I am currently a senior in high school, and dual-enrolled in a College English and a College Physics class with St. Louis University (SLU). I noticed that on the BFA course sequence, there is an ENG elective and PHY elective--both in the 7th semester. I was wondering if these classes are transferable, so that I could possibly get out of taking one or both of those electives. ",

            "comment": "It's possible, but not likely for English. I think they will probably make you take it here anyway because the english classes here are pretty specialized, same with Physics.  I graduated High school with my AA and only had 6 credits ( two classes) transfer.  Psychology and an Elective, which I'm gonna take an extra elective now because you use electives here to specialize into the Art area you want to do in the industry ",

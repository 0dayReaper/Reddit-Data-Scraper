    "postText": "I have been considering DigiPen as an option for college, (I'd be a RTIS major), but I have some worries about it.  My three main concerns are how to deal with the workload, the overall cost, and whether or not I'd be able to get a job in coding outside the gaming industry and Seattle.  I have family out in Seattle, so that should help dealing with the amount of work.  Could I have some second opinions on these three worries?  Any and all opinions are greatly appreciated.  ",

            "comment": "Students who have graduated with RTIS degree have gotten jobs from fields within, as well outside, the gaming industry.  So I wouldn't worry about that.  I'm not sure what kind of advice to give you on finances, but in terms of workload it is pretty large.  There can be some students at the school who will try to convince you that you are doomed to fail, but honestly while the workload is substantial, it is also doable.  Digipen has a lot of resources to help you succeed.  If you are unsure of whether you can handle the workload, consider these things.  Have you done any kind of college, or IB high school program? And if so, how good were your grades?  If you have done one of the two, and didn't do well, then this school probably won't be much different.  If you haven't done either, you could still do very, but maybe consider junior college if you are worried about your own capabilities.  But even if you do go to Digipen regardless of anything, use your first year wisely.  Make sure to work hard, and figure out what the best workflow is for you.  I say this because the following years will only get more difficult, so you want to make sure that you're studying, working, and learning skills are figured out by the end of your first year.\n\nAll in all though, go check out the school, talk to a representative.  It really is a fantastic institution.  It may have it's flaws, but what school doesn't?",

                    "comment": "I visited DigiPen in April of 2015 and the big takeaway from that visit was the workload.  I talked to some students and an admissions rep, but I felt like they had an agenda and I wanted a neutral party's advice as well.  I kinda guessed that DigiPen isn't to generous on giving out scholarships.  Can you confirm that?  ",

            "comment": "- Overall Cost:  \n  \nThis is definitely a concern that everyone should have when going to DigiPen especially since the prices have increased recently (within the last few years at least). I would say, if you can, seek out scholarships and grants and work your butt off on getting those. Being in vast amounts of debt is a crushing experience.  \n  \n- Workload:  \n  \nOne of the first things I did when I started at DigiPen was latch onto a study group. I stuck with that study group all throughout DigiPen and I was happy to have done so. Working through problems with friends can go a long way in teaching yourself how to do things. This is especially important since some concepts at DigiPen can be difficult to grasp at first. I also agree with everything that HolyCrapf said about workload.  \n  \n- Job Opportunities:  \n  \nYou'll definitely be able to get a job outside of the game industry. Microsoft hires DigiPen grads quite often, though you might not be guaranteed to have a full-time position there(you would be on a contract most likely). That's something you have to work for either through an internship while at DigiPen or while you're a contractor.\n\nThe question is, do you want to work in games? If there is any shred of doubt I would tell you to go to a state school and get a CS degree there. Much cheaper and you can still get into games depending on how you go about developing your CS skills.\n\nEven if you don't have any doubts I would say to weigh your options very carefully. Given the cost of DigiPen, unless you are dead set on attending, I would say you should get a CS degree at a state university and develop a game on the side. There are so many resources on game development these days that you can definitely make a game on your own time.\n\nBut, DigiPen definitely has its perks. You'll be in an environment filled with people that want to make games and are super passionate about them. DigiPen also gives you the structure that will force you to develop a game simply due to them being class assignments. To some extent DigiPen will also get you a leg in the door at more than a few game studios. Especially ones that have hired DigiPen grads that have proven themselves. It's a good school to have graduated from, but I don't believe for a second that it is the only way to get into the industry or that it's the easiest way.  \n  \nHopefully what I have said has helped. Feel free to ask more questions if you have any.\n\nEDIT: Old post, updated to new one.",

                    "comment": "To add to your points on financing:\n\nIf you're really worried about cost, but you're sure you want to do games, and you understand the rigors of CS and still want to do it - fill out your un-essential required credits at a community college. Figure out what you can transfer, and take those at a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nDigiPen CS and MAT classes are fantastic, and totally worth it.\n\nDigiPen PSY, SOS, and COM(munication) are not at all worth the price of a digi-credit.",

                    "comment": "Your advice is very helpful.  DigiPen is my top choice right now followed by University of Utah as a close second.  In my research of both of these schools, they both place their alumni in good places, but how they do it and the environment they do it in couldn't be more different.  What would be your advice on the typical college experience of U of U versus the atypical experience of DigiPen?",

                            "comment": "I would say that I sort of feel like I missed out when it comes to the general college experience. At DigiPen I put my head down and worked my butt off and that's about it. Once I graduated the other parts of my life caught up with me, but it was a shock to the system to some extent. I also didn't get to meet as many different kinds of people as much as I might of liked to. I lived, ate, and breathed video games for 4 years and for the most part so did my peers. I would have definitely considered U of U simply due to the opportunity of having a more balanced college experience. But, I will say that the amount of granular knowledge that I have from DigiPen is not offered at too many other universities. More than a few people that I have worked with simply didn't have bits of knowledge that I took for granted and most certainly learned while at DigiPen. I could just be mixing what I know from the industry with what I learned from DigiPen as well though. It's a little bit of a blur now.  \n  \nIn any case, the bottom line is that DigiPen may offer a curriculum that goes deeper into the coding aspects of games, but it's quite expensive and puts you into a social environment that isn't terribly conducive to doing things outside of school. U of U gives you the chance to do things outside of school and meet a vast array of people and still learn enough about programming to get a job in the industry.  \n  \nFinal Thoughts:  \nTalk to a recruiter or some other official about U of U to get a better understanding on what they offer. I'm going off of my experience with the guy I work with and what he said about the school when I asked him about it I didn't go too deep into asking about the actual coding aspects of it, I just assume that he has a few knowledge gaps given the questions he has asked me and the problems he has faced.  \n  \nFeel free to ask more questions!

            "comment": "As a freshman currently dealing with the intro to the heavy workload, I can tell you that it's not as bad once you're actually in it. Doing so many credits at any most other colleges will make you a bit of an oddity, but because everyone else is doing the same thing, it just feels normal. It's not until I actually try relaxing that I realize how much work there's been, and it's not uncommon to be hit by all the stress you should have felt during the term on your seasonal breaks.",

            "comment": "Can't answer personally for most, as I was in the art program, not rtis, but your question about being able to get coding jobs outside of video games did make me think of one thing.  \n\nWhen I worked at Sony, one of our coders was baller. He knew his shit and often got offers from places wanting to poach him.  He'd worked in games for like 15 years, and no matter who came calling, he wouldn't go because he didn't want to uproot his family.  Finally someone came with an offer that he accepted. \nSpaceX.  He got poached by fucking SpaceX. Now he makes code for the Dragon rocket that they hope to send to Mars someday. He's satisfied with his move. \n\nJust shows that if you get good enough with coding, it can probably be made applicable to whatever field you really aim for. It's just about how much work you put in.  ",

    "postText": "Hey guys! So I'm *this* close to enrolling into digipen and I just wanted to know a little more about the housing since there isn't much on their website. From what I've seen on the internet, most people chose to stay in apartments rather than what digipen offers. Is there a reason to why most people don't stay in the dorms offered by digipen?  If anyone does stay in the housing that digipen offers please PM me!  :P",

            "comment": "Well, I pay $650 to split a 3BR with two other people, and Digipen housing is $900 to split a 2BR with 3 other people. That alone should give you a pretty decent idea.\n\nAdditionally, the Digipen housing is not dorms. It's just apartments that DP acts as the middleman for, which is why the rate is so high. (because they profit off you) I live about 100 meters from there anyway.\n\nLastly, and this is anecdotal, but housing seems to be full of absolutely terrible roommates. I would bet this is because the parents who have kids who still act like children aren't comfortable with them getting a Real House in the Real World(tm), but that's my opinion.",

It's not that everyone in housing is still a bratty kid, (the majority of people in housing are fine) it's that of the bratty kids, they're pretty much all in housing.\n\nEspecially if you're an international student, the security of it can be a lot greater, so housing does have its perks. The 9 month lease can suck if you want to take summer classes or work Projectfun though.",

I'll be definitely staying in housing for the first year because I'm an international student and my parents would feel more comfortable sending me to a place where they can trust. I also think it would be easier for me to complete the first year without the stress of managing my own apartment. Just a quick question: What type of rules do they have that you were referring to?

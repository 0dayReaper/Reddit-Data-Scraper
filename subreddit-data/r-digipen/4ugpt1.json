Because if I'll be moving around a lot, I'd rather have a lighter/thinner laptop that keeps the specs.\n\n2) 15.6\" VS 17.3\" I've seen many people recommend 17inch screens, but I've always owned 15.6\". Should I switch over?\n\nThanks :)",

Should I switch over?\n\n17 is just easier on the eyes, it's up to you. Also higher resolution options can be useful.\n\n\n&gt; **Other tips:**\n\nGet something durable, not some random HP/Dell case that isn't meant to survive more than a year before falling apart.\n\nGet something to haul it around with that will be easy to pack/unpack often.\n\nMake sure it's not super loud, although this is pretty hard to tell beforehand anyways.",

            "comment": "It should also be noted that while having a laptop is a very good idea, most professors will ask that you test on lab computers before submission anyway. Also, RTIS professors usually don't allow laptops during class. \n\nI think you could be fine with a desktop computer at home and the lab computers at school. A laptop is mostly useful for keeping things consistent between home and school. ",

It's so much more convenient to just have everything you need in one place, with all your settings ready to go whenever you need.\n\nAlso, don't compile *or render* off the network drives.",

Mine has done nothing but hold my smash soundtrack CD for working music.\n\nScreen real-estate is a valuable thing, you'll be having a lot of different stuff open at once. I very often have my work in one window, Chrome open to google stuff about it, and then another window for the assignment PDF. Unless you're strongly partial to a laptop with a 15.6\", I'd say go for the larger screen. \n\nThe best option, though, is to invest in a secondary monitor, since that gives you far more working space than a laptop alone ever can. Two is even better if that's in budget, so you can keep one at home, and the other in your teamspace. (although you won't get teamspace until sophomore year) I got one for this reason, it was super useful, and I wish I had gotten a second when it was on sale.",

    "postText": "I am a CS student at a local community college in Tennessee and am thinking about transferring to Digipen next fall. However, I have a family and up until I started considering Digipen, we were planning on buying a house here in TN. \n\nLooking at the housing market in Redmond was a bit of a shock, houses that would sell for 200k here are 1million in the area around campus. So I guess I have two main questions:\n\n1.\tAre there any decently priced places to live that would allow me to commute?\n\n2.\tIs there family housing made available by the school?\n\nAlso, as a side question, my fianc\u00e9 is in school for elementary education, can anyone recommend other schools in the area for this degree? \n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

            "comment": "It depends on what you want for your commute and what your definition of \"decently priced\" is. Walking, no, it's going to be hard to find a decent house you can own nearby, although there are reasonable townhouses to rent. Don't mind a 30m drive? Yeah, you can get something more reasonable north of DP. \n\nAnd no, the school only provides subletting of the local townhouses to individuals. (at a markup, no less)",

Everett and Snohomish also have some cheaper houses, which is more north of campus by 30-60 min depending on where you look.\n\nAs far as other schools in the area, Bothell has a University of Washington extension campus that may offer the education degree. The main campus is in Seattle. \n\nIf you want something closer to campus you\u2019ll likely need to rent.",

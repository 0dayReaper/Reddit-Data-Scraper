That's what I was hearing when I attended anyway and that was about 2 or so years ago.\n\nSounds like that transition still hasn't happened.\n\nI have been hearing about turmoil in the art degree ever since I started at DigiPen as well. Student's emotional and physical breakdowns simply give the issue more gravity.\n\nHopefully the faculty will stand up and change things for the better. I think a big part of that comes from Getting in contact with Claude as he is typically insulated(afaik) from knowing this kind of stuff which is frightening.",

Since I'm not there and don't have any BFA contacts I can't really say whether that's bull, but going by the course sequence it seems like a reasonable thing.\n\nHaving kids break down both mentally and physically is completely ridiculous though. This should not be happening and they need to fix this.\n\nEdit:\n\nOne thing though- I get the point of the post, and it's definitely a good idea to warn people about this, but it might be more useful to make a separate post on Reddit, as it'll add a sense of objectivity. I mean, that 8Chan board was made for people to express personal views and grievances, yes? It's not going to be terribly convincing to people considering going, because it's easy to write off 8Chan users as jaded or whatever.",

First 2 years are traditional art concepts and stuff and then the next 2 are more based on the 3D aspects of art. That's sort of how it is afaik. \n\nThe problem comes in when the art students are so overloaded with work that they can't even choose to jump onto a game team. It also becomes a problem when art teachers refuse or choose not to accept work that the student has done for their game team. Thus creating even more work for the student to do.\n\nThat was an issue with some of the art students that I knew while I was attending DigiPen. I think that's more of what is meant by \"integration\" where art students can use the artwork they generate for the game they are working on.\n\nWho knows though. I feel like the BFA program may not be advertised in the correct way. Like I mentioned earlier, the BFA is more focused on movie animation rather than games which can be considerably different. There are a lot more constraints on games. ",

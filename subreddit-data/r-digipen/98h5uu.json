    "postText": "Heya!\n  I graduated from DP as a BFA and am moving out due to a job. I was wondering if anybody out there would like to take my room? \n It\u2019s a master bed with bath and it\u2019s about the size of a small studio apartment all together. Rent is $800 while utilities are $40-90 depending on the season. Rent is paid online while utilities through Venmo. I\u2019ll be leaving an L-Shaped desk in the room and a mini fridge as well. \nHave to like cats and be okay with rooming with two other girls. \n\nIt\u2019s a really good price for your own bed and bath in Redmond! Right near the movie theatre, QFC, Redmond Town Center, Redmond Transit Center and DigiPen shuttle access at Avalon. If ya don\u2019t have a car, it\u2019s a very convenient location for walking. QFC is a 10 min walk while DigiPen is about 35 min walk. \n\nThe roommates just ask for ya to be respectful, one person only for the room, and to clean up after yourself. \n\nIf ya have any questions about the place, feel free to shoot me a message!\n  Thanks! :)",

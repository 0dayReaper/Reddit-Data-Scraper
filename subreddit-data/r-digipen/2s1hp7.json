But, like what the others said here, that doesn't mean that you won't be at the school for ungodly amounts of time. \n\nTo be honest though, a lot of your time will go into the projects that you do at DigiPen. Usually it's game but you get projects from other classes as well. Those are the things that are preparing you for the real world, I can't tell you how many times I have remembered how to do something simply because one of the projects I did at DigiPen popped into my head. Great stuff in my opinion.",

I don't think I'll ever forget this, I started the morning with Cox (Physics) and ended it with Wang (Digital Circuits).\n\nEh, 10 hours is possible I guess.  Teacher's aren't made to turn in their schedules until really late in the game, and *way* too often you don't know who is teaching a class until they show up 15 minutes late the first day of class.",

            "comment": "Senior BSGD here\nIt does vary from degree program to degree program but most freshman take 6-8 class (I know people who did 9). You usually either have a class twice a week for 1.5 hours or once a week for 3 hours. So depending on how your schedule falls out you can end up spending anywhere between 3-9 hours in class each day.\n\nHowever don't let this fool you as homework is often better done at school. Many students work at home but I would say most end up spending between 10-14 hours at school. During the peak of my sophomore year I actually moved my desktop to school and was there from 9am to 10pm-12pm 5 days a week. \n\nThe school is known for putting out graduates that are really good. It is also known for its ridiculous schedules and work loads, and is often referred to metaphorically as a crucible or gauntlet. Its a very demanding school but those that really have a passion for games can make it through. You definitely have to love everything about the development process or otherwise your job turns into torture.\n\nOver all the school is tough, definitely a lot harder than most schools. I've had lots of problems over my years here, but I still would go to DigiPen if I was given the chance to do it all over knowing what I know now. Its definitely not for everyone as it can be a bit soul crushing at times, but the amount I have learned here is insane. I know that while life would have been more \"enjoyable\" at another college for many reasons, I don't think I would have been able to grow as much as I have as a person or a developer/designer had I not come here.\n\nTLDR: People usually usually have 3-7 hours of in class time per day, and 1-6 hours of homework on top of that. Its stupid hard, but doable, and can enrich you greatly if you can handle it.",

    "postText": "So im just gonna go ahead and start listing them, answer them as you like.\n\n-I have been programming for years, and want to graduate and become a Game Director. But i cant afford to go to the school, can my prior experience as a programmer, whos made games in the past, get in with a lower entrance fee?\n \n-Does Digipen have online courses at all? Or do I have to move all to attend classes? Id love to be in person, but that might not be possible, is there an alternative?\n\n-I didnt get the best gpa in public school, however I got straight A's in both computer science classes, and programming classes. Would my lower gpa(2.5) make it harder to get in despite the computer knowledge?\n\n-Is it worth the risks? It will cost me a lot if I got accepted. But what I'm curious about is if its worth the degree. Do I have a much better chance getting a job at a game company. Or is it not likely Ill get a job after graduating for several years?\n\nCan the job, pay off the school? \n\nThanks for your answers, and let me know if you have any other feedback as well.",

            "comment": "1) No, you will not be able to get in with a lower fee. Also having knowledge in computer science might be detrimental as DigiPen teaches you the best practices from the ground up.\n\n2) Generally there are no online courses, but during Covid classes have been both in person and online.\n\n3) Joining the school does not have a GPA requirement but the essay you write for the school is very important, which will be your main determing factor to go to the school.\n\n4) The risk is worth it if this is truly your passion. Other schools are cheaper and probably rhe safer choice if you are not sure. I would recommend this route. Depending on the degree, it will be worth it. The CS degrees are truly one of the best and imo are worth it. The others aren't as much so because they are not as fleshed out as the CS degrees.\n\n5) You do have a better chance getting into the game industry by proxy of being around other developers and building your portfolio pieces. \n\n6) The job can pay off the school really quickly if you are a programmer. Being an artist or designer, it will take longer but still doable.\n\nNow just from personal experience, it was a 100% worth it for me, I knew I wanted to be a game developer as a kid. The friends, experiences, and things I learned is something I would never trade in my life. Those alone are worth way more than the cost of the school. After my senior year (2021), I was able to land a really nice AAA industry job where what I do is exactly what I learned and wanted to do. All my other programmer friends also have very good jobs in the industry. For artists and designer friends. They are still on the grind but getting there.",

Is that the final price? If so are there any grants i can get or student loans(though i know not wise to get one so large) that i can get to help? Because it is my dream school, but the price is simply out of my range",

BAGD will go into level designing more and will give you base fundamental for all types of design. BSGD is much more of a programming degree first, then a design addendum to that. This could be anything really. I  not sure.",

If i were to move to the digipen near me, in Redmond, would i be able to focus almost entirely on school? Or would i be juggling a job at the same time, along with the cost of living?",

I would assume you'd be looking closer to 200k total to cover housing and whatnot. That would likely be with roommates as well since I'm betting rent is crazy in Redmond.",

It's 9 years ago now but when I started I think I was only making \\~35k at a midlevel studio in Redmond. I slowly climbed up and now I am making 100k+. It can just take a bit to start making that much. You'll likely have to hit senior level or work at one of the big AAA companies(where you may unfortunately work a lot of OT) before you start making a ton of money. That's my experience anyway. Hope this helps.",

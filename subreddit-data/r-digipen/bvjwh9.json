    "postText": "Hey guys, recently I've been thinking about applying to DigiPen as a grad student. In a couple years, I'll graduate from a different university with a BS in Computer Science and minors in mathematics and art.\n\n I was wondering if anyone had experience with this program? My school doesn't offer any sort of game development courses and I'm not even sure they offer an in depth computer graphics course. I don't want to be completely lost so I've been teaching myself how to use Unity in my spare time. I just don't want to be really lost if I get accepted.\n\nAlso, for people in the Redmond area, what is the general cost of housing for a one bedroom vs two bedroom apartment? What if it has a yard? I have two large dogs who I refuse to leave behind, since they've practically saved my life.",

Your BSCS should prepare you enough to get in I suspect. Many questions should be directed at admissions (you can find contact info for them on the website).\n\nUnity experience will help with things down the line. The school wants you to learn engine design so they\u2019ll have you build one from scratch during the coursework.",

It can apply well outside of games too, but if you\u2019re not particularly interested in games it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\n\nDon\u2019t plan on having a very active social life while attending. Much of your time will likely be spent on class work. Time management is critical. The dogs will provide a good reason to take short breaks.",

I've wanted to work on them since I was in highschool, but I'm lost on how to get started besides my CS degree. My thinking was that DigiPen would be a good place to get connections and experience with actual game programming. I was just browsing jobs and everyone wants someone with professional experience that I don't know how to get. Do you have any advice in regards to obtaining relevant experience?",

Consider doing the same with Unreal too. These independent projects are quite valuable, but so are group projects.\n\nMost roles that you will find are likely geared toward people who have been in the industry for a little bit. It\u2019s hard to find junior positions, so maybe look at internships. This is often how a lot will start, or through other roles such as QA maybe.",

The office of admissions told me internships are generally given to undergrad. Would an internship with another software company be comparable as experience? \n\nI feel like I'll be behind because I live in an area without video game companies, and even another tech company internship will have me relocate for the length of it.",

It\u2019s all in how you sell and present yourself. \n\nI would say that the majority of students come from places without much games industry, and that\u2019s ok. The industry needs diversity in all forms.",

That being said, it's always more difficult to get aid on a first year. \n\nInformation on grants and scholarships are available here:\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/undergraduate-scholarships/\n(For Undergrads)\n\nAlso, seeing as 12% of the student body is composed of international students, I'd be shocked if they didn't offer aid to those students (especially considering the US is one of, if not the single most, expensive countries to study in the world). Many universities do offer some sort of aid based on your need, but there are often not guaranteed and require you to prove your current situation :)\n\n",

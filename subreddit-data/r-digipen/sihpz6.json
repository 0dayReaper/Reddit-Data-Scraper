Applied to CSGD, and would probably need scholarships to attend, as my parents have $0 in savings despite making 120k a year.\n\nShould I still attend? What scholarships could potentially benefit me the most?\n\nThanks.",

DigiPen also has several separate scholarships you can apply to with short essays including financial aid and diversity scholarships. I would definitely recommend looking for outside scholarships as well\u2014there are lots out there for people going into stem. Good luck!",

Women in tech? Scholarship. 1/16 native American? Scholarship. Atheist? Scholarships. Descendent of a civil war veteran? Scholarship. Almost anything can be turned into scholarships if you're willing to write enough essays. \n\nAnd if you're really confident you'll make it through, some government student loans aren't the worst idea, since you make bank on the other end.",

    "postText": "So I was homeschooled, and the only time I dived into advanced math came between the years of 2004-2007 when I made it to college algebra at LCC. I can actually enjoy math sometimes, and would not mine learning all the kinds of math required at Digipen.\n\nBut if I started attending Digipen, with my rusty algebra skills and almost no knowledge of advanced math, just a willingness to learn and work, do I have a snowball's chance in heck of handing what Digipen throws at me for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design program (did I get that right?)\n\nAlso, how are their programming courses for someone who understand the fundamentals of programming, hates it but wants to learn it, and is a visually oriented person?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hi, I just finished my freshman year at Digipen. I started Digipen as a BSCSGD but ended up switching my second semester to BSCS. As a senior in high school I took advanced precalc and before that algebra 2. Even though I took these, MAT 140 still sucked for me and I ended up retaking it my second semester. This  is not totally uncommon. If you will succeed or not is very dependent on how much work you are willing to put in. Just make sure you have a strong understanding of algebra. \n\nAs for the programming, Im not too sure if BSGD is what you are looking for if you hate programming. You're first semester you'll be taking CS120 and CS100, and CS170 and CS230 your second semester. Over the semester in CS230 you'll write somewhere around 3000 lines of code and spend somewhere near 12-15 hours on each assignment. If you hate programming, this will be hell for you. If you are passionate and want to learn, it is totally manageable.\n\nIf you are more interested in game design over programming games, you may want to look into BAGD. This is what some students switch over to from BSGD if they hate the programming and just are interested in game design.\n\nHope this helps",

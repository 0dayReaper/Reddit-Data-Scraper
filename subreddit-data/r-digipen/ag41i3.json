    "postText": "Hello! I am currently applying to Digipen this year for the BFA. I have been very entertained with all the horror stories ive been reading, so current students of any degree please answer some questions:\n\n1. I'm super interested with the group game design project, Did one person dominate the whole project or was it a good experience for you?\n\n2. Any good or bad stories? What are things you like and hate about the school?\n\n3. Does digipen still have company events? I've read about meetings where students branch out and meet new people in the industry. \n\nThanks hope to see you if I get in!",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm currently a 5th year senior RTIS student at DigiPen so I might have some useful opinions, although I don't know how useful it'll be for a BFA student. \n\n\n1) If you're talking about the game project where students from multiple degrees (hopefully, but not always actually) form a group to design and develop a game, I would say that it's not usually one person dominating the project. You can often have one or more super teammates that can get a lot of work done and contribute heavily to the game, but in my experience that doesn't stop it from being a team effort where everyone worked towards the same goal. I did have one year where the team was kind of divided on how the game mechanics should work out, but in the end everyone still came to an agreement on what we should do. \n\n2) I've honestly found some of my best friends at this school. The shared suffering kind of helps, it's not hard to crack a few jokes about being tired and kind of depressed which makes it not so bad if you actually get depressed like I did (for reasons separate from DigiPen). Everyone understands how hard it is to keep up in this school and it's very easy to ask for help. For example, I was having a rough time trying to pass the advanced graphics course and it doesn't help that I HATE graphics (which isn't what you want to hate if your in the RTIS degree program), so I finally asked mmy friend who was the graphics programmer on my previous. He looks at what my program is drawing and just from what is being displayed alone tells me what I'm probably doing wrong. I look through my code and, sure enough, he's exactly right. What had been taking me hours to not figure out took him moments to see. I passed my class no problem thanks to him. The professors are also pretty understanding about what it's like to be a DigiPen student. Several professors actually were DigiPen students themselves. \n\nNow on the bad side...  The workload is pretty insane sometimes in part because of the game project class. For the first year of GAM class, it's worth 3 credit hours, 4 for the second year, and 5 from then on out. And I find personally find that not to be the case, I have had weeks where I have done far work for that class than is befitting for those amounts of credit hours. If things go right for you because the team is good at planning, time management, scoping, testing, etc and things go smoothly, then those number are probably right. But things have not always gone well for me and some problems can put you in crunch mode for a long time to get them reasonably fixed. It doesn't help that the GAM class both is and isn't a safe time to make mistakes. It's fine to make the mistakes and try to learn from them because we're not yet professionals so it won't cost you your job or anything, but you better learn fast because you'll need to fix your mistakes in time to submit the game if you want to pass the class and not get held back a year while you wait for it to be offered again (this is more true for the second and third years of DigiPen, failing within the first and fourth years could just see you taking the class over the summer). It tries to mimic real life in that you must ship something and there are hard deadlines, but it also ends up mimicing the unhealthy crunch times required to make the game shippable. From what I've seen of the GAM project rubric so far, this probably isn't as bad as it used to be now that it's significantly more open rather than tied down to having certain features being exactly a certain way if you wanted to just barely pass, which is different from when I started. Which actually brings me to my next point: because of the way DigiPen is structured, it cannot react quickly if it finds that certain aspects of a class are subpar. It'll take at least a year before any changes to a course that would benefit students are made, so if you feel you've been dealt a bad hand, while you can eventually get the school to address it, you're stuck with it for now. I don't HATE DigiPen for this, and I'm certainly not envious of future students that get those benefits. If anything I'm glad the program gets better so that future students don't feel like they were forced to meet any crazy requirements.\n\nThere is one thing I still don't understand about DigiPen that actually really annoys me though. DigiPen has its own proprietary game engine called Zero Engine that they've been developing for a while now. Just last Fall they made the engine open source, so now anyone could look at the code and even suggest edits. Almost immediately after, they dissolved the Zero Engine team, some of whose members were professors at DigiPen themselves. With the sudden pay cut, those professors ended up leaving DigiPen to work elsewhere, one of them literally within the first month of classes. What I don't understand is why they dissolved the team in the first place. Going open source doesn't mean that they aren't needed and even if change requests could be made by other people who've edited the code themselves, the team that originally worked on it knows the structure of the original engine best to know which changes would actually be beneficial and which ones would start to break and structural rules they laid down for themselves. I have no clue why this happened, and that bothers me. \n\n3) Yes, DigiPen still has company events. DigiPen will never stop having company events. They will definitely still be here when you get here, I can assure you of that. \n\n\nLike I said, I don't think my experiences translate well to the BFA degree program, but you might get something out of it. If you do get in I probably won't see you as I'm on my way out, but  I hope you enjoy your time here or find out quickly that it's not for you. That may sound bad, but I think it's ok to know that DigiPen isn't the right place for you because it's not for everybody and wasting your time spending a ton of money to come here won't suddenly be worth it if it wasn't the place for you. If it feels like the right place, great! Make some friends, work on some games, don't kill yourself with too much work.",

            "comment": "Heyo, BFA senior here. I'm late to the party, but hopefully helpful to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worked on films, not games, but the answer is - hopefully not. My team was very collaborative and it was truly a team effort. Some teams are really sticking together because of a single individual, and some teams are overwhelmed with someone who's elbowed themselves into power. It really is luck of the draw and careful analyzing of your peers to try to root out who you would not work well with. The school has resources to work out team conflicts with, but sometimes teams just fall apart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod do I have lots of both. Here's what I'll say: DigiPen is really good at generalist and technical education. Don't come here as a concept or illustration person - the program is not designed for that and the man in charge of the BFA does not want to allow specializations. If you like 3D, Digi's probably a better place for you. There are so so many talented, compassionate professors here that you will love. There's a few that you will hate, but the nice thing is that Digi generally doesn't allow incompetent people to stay teaching for them. My cohort has gotten multiple people fired. There's a sense of camaraderie at Digi that's really wonderful, and the program is a good overall education. They need different BFA degrees, but that change is being stifled at the top level of administration. The school smells sometimes, especially the staircases. There's an attitude of \"work harder, you're not trying enough\" that can be really damaging if you don't know how to temper it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, DigiPen communicates a lot with area companies. There are company days regularly and the school internship fair is actually at the end of the week (shit) ",

One for concept, one for texh art, one for animation, and so on.\n\nThe experimental period is over, and the program is as solid as a generalist degree is going to get, but it's no longer catering to the industry as the industry wants specialists. Most faculty understand this and are trying to change things. One person at the top does not. ",

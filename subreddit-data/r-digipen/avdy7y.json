I've read that no one will take BSCSGD seriously as a good degree for programming, though I think also most of this feedback was from alumni back when it was just BS in Game Design (minus the Computer Science).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Is this still the case? Do employers really care so much about what's tagged after the Computer Science label? I would have actually thought that having Game Design in the degree would have been a nice touch for a potential employer.\n2. Is it really that big of a difference? The only real difference I can see is the Computer Graphics line of classes in the RTIS degree instead of Game Design classes.\n3. How difficult is it to switch from CSGD to RTIS, if necessary?\n4.

I think theirs applies more to the pre-2018 BSGD, where it was a hybrid degree/double major, as opposed to now, when it's essentially a major in CS and a minor in GD, but it's still accurate. Say, now, it's a 75:25 split between programming:design. That's not enough to be a designer imo, especially in a crowded field with people who are getting far more design training, like BAGDs, (my point) and if you list that 25% on your resume, the person looking at it will realize you have less programming knowledge than the pure CS degrees (their point).\n\n&gt;What is a technical designer?\n\n\"Technical Designer\" is a pretty variable title. Every studio defines it differently, damn near. The studio I work at now doesn't have any by that name, but all of the designers I've spoken to are highly technical, including our Lead Designer. Some places, it's essentially engineers who support designers, other places it's designers who sometimes rarely write C++, sometimes it's designers who are really expected to script a lot. It's too vague to really have a good conversation about, unfortunately, and it leads to a lot of communication issues due to the meany things it can mean.\n\n&gt;What are \"design\" related jobs? What are programming jobs?\n\nI don't know what you're asking for here, sorry. Do you want job titles for what designers and programmers do in industry?\n\n&gt;Is BSGD not conducive to programming jobs because it is more \"design\" focused?\n\nThis loops around a bit back to what the other guy was saying and my first bit. Let's go back to the 75:25 split between programming:design. Given that, I'd say BSGDs are going to be programmers.  \nSo then, our next question is why would you give up 25% knowledge in your main field, programming, instead of having (almost) 100% in it like the more pure CS degrees? That's not a rhetorical question, it's a sincere one - there are valid reasons to do it, but obviously the cost of losing knowledge in your direct field is very large.  \nIf what you want to program is something something that's inherently linked to design, like gameplay, UI, or AI, then that 25% design knowledge allows you to communicate with your designers better, and understand why you're doing things a certain way instead of following it blindly. That's very useful. (although I am biased - I work as a gameplay engineer)  \nThat means I think BSGD is great for programming jobs which work closely with design. The catch is, of course, that it means that imo it's worse than RTIS for everything else due to the CS knowledge given up. And as a double-punch, because there are more gameplay, UI, and AI jobs than BSGDs, you can still definitely get those jobs and do well in them as an RTIS or BSCS. As a concrete point, at the AAA studio I work at, there are more RTISes *just on gameplay* than BSGDs anywhere on the project.  \nNow, given that DigiPen overstuffs its curriculum to the brim, a BSGD's 75% knowledge here is still well over 100% of pure CS degrees at most universities, so that doesn't mean BSGDs are stuck in those 3 job titles. It's just that if you want to work outside them, why be a BSGD?\n\ntl;dr: BSGD is good across the board for programming, and excellent in a few jobs. RTIS and BSCS are great across the board, and still get jobs in the area BSGD is excellent in. You make your own call, but I would advise almost everyone to go RTIS/BSCS. BSGD is probably right for some number of people, but I don't think it's very many.",

                    "comment": "Hello, BSGD alumni here. Graduated in 2012.\n\n1) If you're going for a straight gameplay programmer position then it might be more difficult because of what most schools do with the design degrees which is to water down everything the designers learn compared to the programming degrees. So DigiPen's answer to that was to slap on the CS bit to the degree name. I will say that for BSGD we had the choice to take a watered down version of ART 101 or take a \"designer\" version of ART 101. We did not get that same treatment for programming courses though. I believe BAGD has that option though. (I think, I'm not a recent grad so things could have changed). Those options make sense though, more science focused programs can have simpler art courses and more art focused programs have simpler science courses.\n\n2) Not sure if this has changed since I attended, graduated in 2012, but the key difference is that RTIS students typically do all of the game engine writing, for the game projects, which gives them a ton of hands-on experience when looking for a job in the future. Because this has been the way of things since RTIS has existed, as far as I know, the RTIS degree has a reputation of creating strong programmers straight out of school. BSCSGD is still a fairly new degree program compared to RTIS.\n\nSo, if you want to be heavier on the gameplay side of things the key is to make sure you are writing those things in the games you are working on.\n\nThe difficulty here is that you are going to be working with people who are just starting to make games, just like you most likely, and you are going to have to work in systems you might not necessarily work in the industry which will make you a stronger programmer but might be difficult when you're not going through the same classes as the RTIS students. Graphics, more advanced physics, and random other things that the RTIS students might do that BSGD does not.\n\n3) If it's the same as I attended then you can easily change degrees in the first 2 semesters but after that it becomes more difficult to change degrees.\n\n4) I actually haven't seen those numbers recently and can't speak to them. I can only offer anecdotes which is that some BSGDs don't get the jobs they want and others do. Some are QA and some are designers while others are programmers. I'm not aware of any BSGD graduate, that I know personally, that is not in some game industry related field. Whether that be educational entertainment, gambling industry or game industry.\n\nRegardless of placement the key here is that it's up to you to make the most of your time at DigiPen and it's up to you to find a job after school. To that end it's best to make friends while at school, obvious, but still important as some or all will end up in the game industry and can potentially get you job opportunities along with potential lifelong friendship! Also, another obvious one, when you do get a job don't burn bridges as this industry is quite small and you never know where others might end up. And it's best not to be a dick, that helps a lot with no matter what you're doing.\n\nFinally, one of the best things to do, and this is super obvious, is to make a great game while at DigiPen. The potentially less obvious thing, though it does make sense, is to find a game that everyone in your team would enjoy making. That will keep everyone focused when working on the game. With the team sizes at DigiPen everyone will likely want to have some hand in the design of it so it's important that everyone finds it interesting. Also, keep your game in scope.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!\n\nEdited due to reddit formatting shenanigans.",

Depends on the employer. It's not a plus for a lot of places that are looking for more pure technical roles, but it's a huge exaggeration to say the degree isn't taken seriously. If you have DESIGNER written all up and down your resume, then yeah, nobody's going to take you seriously as an engineer, but that's on you. The design side did help me get my job, but it was still very much secondary to my programming. The DP alums I'm working alongside are all BSCS or RTIS, for what that's worth, so you can go into gameplay from those degrees too.\n\n2. It used to be a larger difference, (look at the course catalog for 2014-2015) but it's not very significant anymore. The degree got reworked to bring it in line with the general CS core they're establishing across all the CS degrees.\n\n3. Very easy. It was designed that way because so many people found out that (ironically) design wasn't for them, and made the swap. It's even easier now that the degree is closer to RITS.\n\n4. I don't know the numbers, but RTIS is going to be better, because it's way harder to get a job as a designer, and some BSGDs market themselves as such. That said, I don't think I've known anyone competent from either degree not have a job within 6 mo of graduating, and a lot of people get jobs before then. too.   \nThe real issue is graduating. My cohort is going to graduate 11 out of 50-60 BSGDs. Given, some transferred out and graduated in other degrees, but even if you count our transfers in, that 11 goes to 12. Point is, don't worry about getting a job after graduating, worry about getting that far in the first place.",

Why do you feel that most people shy away from Design? The RTIS degree is ABET certified and has a 1 year accelerated masters program, so it already has a couple advantages, as far as I can see from the outside. How useful do you feel the Game Design classes are that separate this degree?\n\nI'm not trying to appear cocky, but I'm not going to worry about graduating.  Ex-military, I'm no stranger to 80+ hour work weeks. 1.5 years of that was spent in an intensive (12 hour days) language training school learning native-level Arabic. I was also a professional C# developer for a short while before enlisting, so I have a lot of confidence in my programming as well. All that said, though, some things are out of our hands, like job openings, right? So, I don't see anything wrong with taking the safer route and getting a job as a programmer. Given my history, this might be the smarter choice anyway (as I have some experience here and the salaries are usually better too).\n\nSo, thank you very much for your reply, wisdom and advice. You guys are really helping clarify the path I want to take!",

Even people with hobbyist experience are usually putting in time here and there in games they enjoy, not sitting down for 8 hours and designing a type of game they hate, or writing pages and pages of documentation, which is superfluous for a small hobby project, but required for professional-level work. Some do it for economic reasons as well, and some just end up liking programming better. (I come pretty close to that last group)\n\nAll the CS degrees are ABET accredited now, afaik. That was part of the reason for unifying the CS core. Nobody in games cares about that, though. That's for Boeing, et al. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't tell you anything useful about the game design courses for BSGD, and I don't think anyone else can, either, save for maybe some design faculty. They used to be the same as the BAGD classes, but got separated in the aforementioned BSGD rework. I believe nobody has taken the new courses yet, so there's not much to go off of. New classes tend to be really painful as they work out the kinks, though.\n\nGenerally speaking, DigiPen's game design program is among the best in the world, but honestly, I don't think any game design program is good yet, relative to other kinds programs. Game design's just too new of a field of education. DigiPen's design program wins relative to other design programs simply because nobody knows what the fuck to do with them yet, with a few exceptions (like USC), so there's not really competition from anywhere competent.\n\nYou'll probably be OK with that kind of background, although I will mention that veterans have roughly the same graduation rate as non-veterans for BAGDs, so at least for that degree, the military experience wasn't a huge help at DP. The intensive language school and C# experience are great signs, though. If you're good enough to hack it as a professional dev, you might not need to come here to make it to industry, but if it's on your GI Bill, that alleviates the huge monetary price, so the overall cost is less steep.",

However, if you care about your *work*, this isn't a negative experience. For instance,  I never go to clubs or have free time because my projects determine if I can continue attending DigiPen, but I enjoy \"marrying my work\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClass Styles: the core classes expect a lot from you and if you cannot learn very quickly and apply what you learn, you will struggle a lot. These classes feel subjective to many first-years, but you learn to contextualize what some of these classes are asking of you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorth the price: for me, 100% yes because I am obsessed with design. If you attend and THEN start to ask yourself if it's worth its price, it isn't. I say this not to scare anyone, but the workload is demanding, the stress is progressively high, and you MUST be able to learn very VERY quickly and not be afraid to ask for help and work with others. It's a lot of fun and one hell of a ride, but if you can't hold on with your values, motivations, and have an enduring work ethic and will that allows you to continue working when you don't feel like it, then this school will start to feel like purgatory, and you will doubt your decisions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe programs have adapted a LOT, so I would advise staying away from looking at those who attended in the past. Even in one year, the school makes large curriculum changes that - as we like to joke - sometimes help, sometimes don't, and in doing so, creates a lot of diverse opinions about DigiPen throughout many years. However, the school is VERY open to student feedback and input, so it's not like the school executes the entirety of its decisions without heavy consideration of how these will affect the school as a whole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall advice: attend, assess yourself as you do so, then make the decision after you ask yourself if you can sustain attending for years ahead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, again, I should add that I am loving every minute of it, but I'm aware that one mistake leads to failing everything. This mindset and workload suits me because I'm a perfectionist, but I cannot speak for you. Some here skirt by and find ways to not work very hard, and this is a place where it shows. I hope you find this helpful as my perspective, but again, I'd advise attending, digging deep into the experience, reflecting, then making your decision to stay or not. Don't be afraid of anything, embrace where your heart goes and if any part of you says \"this sounds scary\", it's OK. It is scary, but taking your career seriously is what DigiPen does, so it's unlike any university you will attend, if you decide to do so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-SourPatchPigeon",

But, I also know that I won't be buying a house anytime soon.\n\nI also went through 4 jobs before getting into one where I felt that my income was able to keep up with my bills and my lifestyle. I do not want to eat ramen and mac n' cheese every day of the week and I want to be able to go out to eat from time to time. Maybe even go on a sweet vacation once a year! I have that now and don't plan to give it up.\n\nSo, understand that your choice of going to DigiPen is likely going to push off the ability to purchase a house and other big ticket items until you can get experience in the industry and get a job that pays well. It will potentially stop you from living on your own too. (I know it did for me, rent is killer!).\n\nAlso, one last thing. If you do choose to go to DigiPen. Make absolutely certain that you will be able to complete the degree program. Financially and otherwise.\n\nYou will get almost nothing if you drop out of the program. Complete the program if you go. If you fail then you are in a ton of debt with nothing to show for it.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

So realize that I'm still in a ton of debt after 7 years of being out of school.\n\nThis financial weight will be on your for a long time unless you find a way to pay it off quickly.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a first year BSGD. I have taken computer science classes at Bellevue College (community college with a good CS reputation in Seattle area), and I can paraphrase what my friends in CS at UW have to say as well. \n\nFirst off, congrats on getting in! One thing that I like to say is that finding good CS teachers of any kind anywhere is difficult! Good computer scientists can make way more money programming than teaching. DigiPen\u2019s number 2 thing it has going for it, if you ask me, is that it has really exceptional computer science TEACHERS. What my friends at other schools tend to find is CS teachers that are very accomplished computer scientists, but very poor teachers. \nThe number 1 thing DigiPen has going for it is the projects. Every semester (save one if you supplement with a paid internship) you get on a team and build something. Later semesters you can do general CS projects but as a BSGD in the beginning you\u2019re on a game team. This is what it feels like it\u2019s all about. Often times you want to just get your other homework out of the way so you can work on Game. I would also say this is a good indicator of if you\u2019ll actually like CS, game design, and this field in general. Also I believe it\u2019s paramount that you make a team with people you can work with, and dare I say, like, than a team of good programmers. \nAlso all of the CS course loads are identical over first year, so you can switch degrees once you have a better idea with no consequence. \nAlso if you like Math, DigiPen is very weak in that department. We have what other universities have for CS teachers: accomplished mathematicians that know a lot and are poor teachers. This is my opinion as someone who loves mathematics and is getting a math minor, based on taking 3 of the 6 or so math professors that are here. ",

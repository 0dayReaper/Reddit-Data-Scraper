    "postText": "My HS grades are mostly average (had issues during my hs years), after I finished it I took a 3 year break and in that time I have gained enough knowledge of C#/Unity to develop any simple game, knowledge of javascript/html/css to develop a simple website, and I'm currently finishing CS50. So I'm now planning to apply but was wondering how likely am I to get accepted. Btw I'm not American. Thanks in advance. ",

Do well on your SAT or ACT and you should be fine. \n\nEdit: While knowing scripting languages will be very beneficial, the CS courses are all taught in C/C++. So get ready to deal with lots of raw memory. ",

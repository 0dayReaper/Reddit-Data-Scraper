            "comment": "I saw this yesterday in hopes that someone might answer, but it looks like no one has. I'm a BSCSGD alumni. Game design degree on the science side so I did interact with CE people when it came to some programming classes.\n\nThe CE program at DigiPen has very few students enrolled in it. At least when I attended you could literally count the students at my grade level that were in the CE program on one hand. So DigiPen typically only gets like 10 or less people interested in CE each year.\n\nSo, with that said, I don't know how well the CE program prepares you for a career dealing with CE things, all I can really say is that most of the CE people I know have gone on to have CE related jobs.\n\nSome have not though.\n\nUnfortunately I don't know much else. Though, with any degree program, you get what you put into it. Putting more effort into your studies will always help you in the long run when going to college.\n\nIn general, definitely consider state universities for something like a  CE degree as it's more recognizable to prospective employers and if you were to ever decide that CE wasn't your thing you'd have the opportunity to transition into another degree. Your choices are severely limited at DigiPen.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live it could be cheaper.\n\nOn top of all of this you would get the real college experience at a state university. DigiPen requires a ton of work to get through and doesn't leave much time for you to have a healthy social life.\n\nHope this info helps!",

I don't really care for the \"college experience\". If I'm just not as into CE as I was thinking I'd be I'd just switch to the general CS/game dev degree at Digipen. Thanks for letting me know.",

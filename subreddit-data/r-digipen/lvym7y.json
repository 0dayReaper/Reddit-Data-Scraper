They\u2019d ask you fairly regular questions like how you would work in a team etc, how you handle difficulties and questions like that. They\u2019ll give you about a minute or five (can\u2019t remember) to prepare before answering the question! \n\nEach question also has a time limit so you have to kee track while answering each question. It\u2019s mostly like a regular interview except you\u2019re recording yourself with nobody replying you. \n\nAll the best! :)",

A similar process is done for financial aid applications to SIT.\n\nI can't say for sure what are the sort of questions the video interview for admissions will entail but if it's similar like their financial aid application, you should be given a set amount of time to rehearse before each new video and written question. \n\nYou should also be able to take a break before answering a new question should you need to, you'll pick up where you last left off. Also there will be a technical set-up process at the very start so I'd recommend using that time to test your webcam and mic, maybe some rehearsals to loosen your nerves.\n\nBest of luck for your video interview!",

    "postText": "Hello people from Digipen!!\n\nI am someone who came from the Media Industry, mainly a graduated VFX Artist. \n\nAlthough I am a VFX Artist, I have always wanted to learn about Game development and I'm sure of it. But at the same time, I am concerned about the job aspects of this particular degree. I inferred the job aspects pales in comparison to BSGD. Thus, resulting to my fear of entering BAGD. Also, I'll be 27 by the time I graduate :P \n\nSo, if it's possible, I would like to get to know your opinions on my thoughts and PLEEEASE don't take this offensively if you're a BAGD student!! I just really want to get to know more about the games industry in Singapore before I dive in to it",

            "comment": "Depends on what you plan to do as a career. BAGD and BSGD are very different. BSGD is basically a computer science course - they have a couple of GD mods but it's honestly like tokenism. You should not take BSGD if you are not already decent at programming (and math).\n\nIf you're planning to continue on VFX work, there should be a demand for technical artist roles. However, BAGD doesn't really have modules that teach VFX or allow you to do a project that focuses on it. You will have to work on it on your own and build a good portfolio. Of course, you can contact the lecturers for advice and guidance.\n\nIf you want to go into \"traditional\" game design roles like mechanics design, level design, quest design, etc. It's already very bleak for those roles now. You probably won't be able to find a job for those in Singapore.\n\nWhat's in demand now (and even Digipen is pushing for it) is UX design. Will definitely have sufficient mods to teach and allow u to build a portfolio for it. Though, the demand is mostly outside the games industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that said, if you want to know more about the games industry in Singapore, here's the blunt truth:\n\n^(It's shit, for game design at least. But even for BSGD and RTIS, most graduates find jobs outside of the games industry. They pay better and it's probably less workload too.)",

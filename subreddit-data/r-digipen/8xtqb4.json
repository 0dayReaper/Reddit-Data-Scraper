    "postText": "I realize that it is probably best to submit my application as soon as I can after applications are opened. However, I don't know when applications open, and I'm a bit behind on putting together my portfolio and essay. \n\nThe site said that new students are enrolled in September. Does that mean this September is the earliest I can apply for Fall 2019? I know for sure I can finish by February 1st, but I'm afraid that (assuming I'm \"qualified\"), the longer I wait, the fewer seats there will be left. Do the seats usually fill up before applications close? Or do I only have to worry about qualification? ",

I\u2019m just going to dm you to give you more details, but if there are other people who are wondering:\n\nIf you\u2019re talking about applying to start school this September, then it might be too late. If you\u2019re talking about next September, you have plenty of time. Applications don\u2019t close til August of the same year. ",

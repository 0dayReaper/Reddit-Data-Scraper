The only thing I can think of would be to dabble in a bit in programming if you don't know much about it.\n\nDigiPen teaches you how to program as if you didn't know anything about it, but it's good to at least discover if you enjoy it or not.\n\nOutside of that and Linear Algebra(MAT140), I can't think of much else.\n\nEnjoy your summer before DigiPen engulfs your entire life for the next four years!\n\nOf course that all depends on how well you manage your time and the goals you wish to accomplish at DigiPen.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.",

            "comment": "IMHO - MAT 150 (Calculus 1), is way more difficult then MAT 140. If you haven't taken a calc class, definitely look into that. It'll be preparing yourself for second semester, but it's definitely a good thing to do. You could technically just take a summer course now and transfer in the credits for calc though. ",

It wouldn't hurt to get a little more familiar with C or linear algebra if you can find resources to put you ahead of the curve in CS120/MAT140, but even if you don't you'll be fine. The freshman classes are among the best-taught at DigiPen. ",

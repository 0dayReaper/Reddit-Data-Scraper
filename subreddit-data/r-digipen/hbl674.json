Because I am an upcoming senior and doing DigiPen's online pre-college Game Design program and I want a good chair so I can make the most of the program with minimal back pain. I really wish it was on campus but what can you do...",

It is an excellent chair (my office in industry uses the same ones!) but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, because I looked into it for the same reason, and for its price point you can buy anything.\n\nIf you're willing to pay top dollar, a lightly-used Aeron is probably the best thing for you, although I personally use a Secretlab Omega at home because I like how it looks, and it's also super comfortable.",

I want to say when I looked at them in 2009 they were around $700. Could be cheaper now but DigiPen could have updated their chairs too.",

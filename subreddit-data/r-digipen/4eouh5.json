            "comment": "It definitely depends on your goals in life. Are you dead set on becoming some sort of game developer be it in art, design, or programming?\n\nAre you willing to give up a large portion of your social life for 4 years to do so?\n\nDo you want to constantly hear people talking about games day in and day out and nothing else? (That's a bit of an exaggeration but not to far from the mark on many days).\n\nIf you said no to any of the above then Digipen might not be a good fit for you.\n\nAlso consider your financial situation. If you plan to take out student loans to pay for a large chunk of your school I'd say you would be better served to go to a state school. Better accreditation, socializing, and cheaper. Plus, you have more options to explore different degree programs if you were to change your mind after having gone through a program for a short while.\n\nDigiPen is specifically meant for those who wish to \"fast track\" themselves into the game industry and while you can definitely achieve that at DigiPen, it's no guarantee and still requires a lot of work on your part to get in.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions. I graduated from the BSGD (Now BSCSGD?) program in 2012. \n\nEDITS: missed some words.",

                            "comment": "Gotcha, another question then is, do you want to get paid less and work longer hours to develop games?\n\nprogrammers in the game industry tend to get paid less compared to their web developer, or other software developer counterparts. Many game studios also have the concept of crunch where if a milestone is determined that it won't be met you'll more than likely be asked to come in on weekends until the milestone is finished. So less pay and more hours essentially.\n\nI've known many programmers coming out of DigiPen to go on to work at Microsoft(MS) for a few years to get their student loans paid off and then moving on to something more game industry oriented. Of course you could shoot for getting into an MS game studio as well.\n\nMore stuff to think about. You have plenty of time which is awesome . May your choices fare-you-well. \n\nEdit: Defined an abbreviation",

While you won't get direct game development experience you'll have the CS knowledge to approach it. You could even make a game on the side while attending school. There are a bunch of tools out there now that will allow you to do that.\n\nBut, I don't believe there is a state school in Washington that offers exactly what DigiPen offers from what I'm aware of.\n\nMy lead has said countless times that as long as you can show that you have worked on some kind of game your leagues beyond other candidates.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!\n\nUtah or California are probably the closest states that offer degree programs that are competitive with DigiPen.",

I can only imagine it's even more expensive now.\n\nWell, looking at UW, I'm seeing http://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/academic/dxarts.html\n\nwhich looks to be a digital arts degree where you could set your focus to be computer animation and potentially game animation, or some other game oriented art focus. Given how easy it is to grab a game engine and just start doing things it probably wouldn't be too hard to do that. To get the ability to do it that is.\n\nWSU has a similar course, though it doesn't look to be as flexible, not certain on that though.\n\nThe UW one appears to have 3D art stuff in there program as well.\n\nCould be something to look into.\n\nHope that helps. Maybe someone on here more art focused will chime in. Could see if you could find someone who graduated from the UW or WSU program and see what their thoughts are.\n\nGood luck on your search!",

If you're interested in coming here and/or making games, definitely go with C/C++ and maybe C#. If you're more interested in general computer science, maybe something like Haskell or furthering your knowledge in Java would be better.\n\nIt's all up to you and you have a lot of time.

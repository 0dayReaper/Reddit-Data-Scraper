    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm just exploring Reddit and boy, never knew I would find something here. So here's the context, I'm currently going to enroll into Digipen Singapore, and honestly from what I've heard. It's scary. \n\nWill hard work and determination during the course be enough? How many hours on average do I have to spend on assignments and test? \n\nI'm asking because I'm a naturally paranoid person and I didn't do so well for my diploma. But I've matured after spending 2 years in mandatory national service. And I'm really scared. \n\nBut, as some wise men once said, if what you're going to do next makes you scared, just do it. \n\nAny advise for this newcomer? :)\n\nRegards,\nKalmatos",

            "comment": "Hello, \n\nI'm a student from the Singapore campus. I'm in my sophomore year now and currently in the RTIS degree. From what I read below, unfortunately our standards here are way higher than the US campus. The standards for grading games here are from what I've heard very different from the US side. (one advice from seniors is to NEVER take game when you do your OIP in Redmond). \n\nThe workload is going to be extremely tough and you'll barely have time for any games much less have a social life. Late submission is never tolerated and will carry heavy penalties. Code mistakes also carry heavy penalties. Memory leaks or any of the such will instantly fail your assignment. I'm also sure by doing your research, you would know that unlike any other University in Singapore,  our PASSING grade is a C. And Cs, which are GPA 1.7, are attained by scoring at least 70 for your course totals (with the exception of math. Math is 50). If your GPA drops below 1.8, you'll be put on academic warning.  If it doesn't improve.. Out you go from school. \n\nNow onto school life. Basically when crunch time hits.. You practically wake up, code/study and go back to sleep. Your home will be school and your bed is just somewhere for you to lie down before going home again if you get my drift. Every year we'll have to develop a game and u can't really submit something half-assed.the people who do usually fail. As for doing assignments last minute.. Every minute will be your last because you'll be swamped with work. If you think I'm exaggerating or maybe your coding skills are godly and you can finish their assignments in 2 hours or so (there are people like that here) then yeah. But even then, any additional time you have, you'll be working on your game project. Work hard but smart.\n\nThat being said, whatever you learn here are real application skills. You will be able to see how math and programming come together to form what you see on your screen. Lecturers are always patient and caring to you and are willing to make time for you to explain things to you. The motive for setting the bar so high is to.make sure you know your stuff before you leave this school. I've seen my batch people fail their basic programming twice and they'll be joining u in your modules even though they enrolled last year. \n\nHonestly, if you think this lifestyle or working style is too intense, you can drop out any time. Don't forget, we're known for our dropout rates unfortunately. There's no shame in dropping out anyway. Some people just get burnt out and/or some people just find this is not what they want. \n\nThat being said, I was in your shoes once. I was anxious and scared af. I kinda suffered and scrapped by. But do evaluate your choices. When the CEO of Digipen asks you to think through carefully if this is for you, they mean it. \n\nFeel free to drop me any questions. ",

            "comment": "man, no one has commented on this one. I have zero knowledge of what the differences are between the US campus and the Singapore one.\n\nI will say that you're going to be at the campus for long periods of time to get your work done. Most likely more for being around your teammates and other students that are going through the same classes as you are.\n\nJust dedicate all your time to school and you should be fine.\n\nIf you plan on having a part time job, then good luck! I know of a few people who have gone through the entirety of Digipen with a part-time job and I have no idea how they did it.\n\nI could potentially give you more info if I knew what degree you were looking to jump into, but I could only give a generic idea of it, as, like I said, I don't know the differences between the Singapore and US campuses.\n\nHope this helps a little bit?",

I did have someone inbox me! :)\n\nI'm gonna enlist for the BSGD, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design.\n\nI have done lots of research, but still mostly just afraid that I can't cope with the workload due to the fact that I always push my assignments to be done at the last minute.\n\nJust hope that I can be self motivated to do that :)",

BSGD is probably a safe bet. you'll get experience with programming and design some solo games if it's anything like the U.S. campus.\n\nAs long as you dedicate yourself to your projects you'll do just fine when looking for work.\n\nDefinitely get your work done asap as that will save you from going through immense amounts of stress.",

                            "comment": "Also not sure on the differences with the Singapore program. You can survive a lot of classes at digipen by putting things off (I did though not as BSGD) with the exception of projects. Projects (solo or team) you must pace yourself with, and even then you're likely to have lots of crunch time as deadlines loom. Non-project course teachers at the Redmond campus generally understand how much time projects can suck up, which is why you can often get away with putting their stuff off and even sometimes doing things late.\n\nIf I were you I'd first relax. If you get accepted by the school to begin with, take that as a vote of confidence from the school, and do your best in your first year. If it's too much, or you barely get by, drop out, because the hardest part is ahead, and you'll just feel worse if you try to soldier on with a reduced credit load.\n\nTimewise a common rule of thumb in the states is expect to spend at least twice the number of credits for the course in hours per week to do well. If you do a typical-for-digipen 20 credit load, expect at least 40 hours of your time out of classes to be used up if you want to do well. There's room for slackers like myself but not much.",

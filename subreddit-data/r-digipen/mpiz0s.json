            "comment": "I posted this before, so it's mildly off-topic, but:\n\n&gt;I'm a BSGD from the pre-2017 iteration of the degree. They changed the degree pretty radically in 2017, which shifted it from being essentially a double-major in both CompSci and Game Design (it took the vast majority of both BAGD's and RTIS's core) to essentially a major in CS and a minor in GD. There's no hard data on what that means for the employability of the students taking it, since the 2017 cohort are going to be 2021 grads, but given what I know about how difficult it was for 2019 and 2020 BAGD grads to find design jobs, I would be surprised if many of the 2021 BSGD grads end up working as designers, rather than on the programming side. Bluntly put, I just don't think there's enough design left in the degree for it to make designers.\n\nOther than that, I wouldn't recommend it if you have to take out loans, since the drop-rate is high and the school is expensive, so that's a great way to really screw up your early adult years. If cost isn't an issue and you want to go into the engineering side of game design, then yes, the rate at which graduates do that is great. It's kind of a devil's bargain in terms of what you give up in terms of social life for your years at the school, but it does deliver what it promises.",

I understand that it does not have enough Game Design in the Degree, but I mainly want to be a Game Developer, but would like to be versed with Game Design too, as I feel like it could help me more in later life to have both the skills. I still have a year of high school left so I still have time to see the statistics of BSCSGD graduates. I will have to take out student loans, but that will be for any Good University as i'm not a US Citizen and i dont live in the US. There are no specialized schools in my country for game design, and the good Computer Science Schools are mainly for Engineering, which are stupid hard to get into, rigorous to the point of having tje highest sucide rates, and frankly the degree you get wont be worth that much internationally and a very low paying job here.",

I've seen people seriously fuck their lives up by attempting to go to DigiPen on loans and then dropping out - don't make that mistake.",

Beyond that, the school has just embraced it as its culture, as a feature rather than a bug. \n\nIt's a very brute-force method. The more students you cull out, the better the average graduates, since the more you remove from bottom, the more the average goes up. They market it as a pride thing - our graduates are the best of the best, they're all great! But the unspoken corollary to the graduates being \"great\" is that the \"good\" and \"ok\" students - which includes people who would be capable of working in the industry - are failed out instead of getting degrees.\n\nIMO, this is the single biggest failing of the school - that it spends too much effort filtering the great devs from everyone else, and not enough on figuring out how to get the good ones to become great, the OK ones to become good, the poor ones to become OK, etc.",

I know USC has a program that's well regarded, but I don't know their statistics offhand.\n\nSince you're taking loans and coming from the US, I'd really just say focus on finding a school with both a good graduation rate and employment rate for alumni of its CS program. Don't worry too much about if it's game-centric - as long as you're learning a lot of C++, you're fine. If you really want a broader skillset, grab a minor in something like psych, since it's a very fundamental field for design, in much the same way mathematics is to physics or economics. \n\n\nMake your own games on the side, too. If you do that and graduate as a solid programmer, you have a real chance of getting into the games industry, and if you don't, you can always fall back on getting a programming job elsewhere and trying for the industry again after you have professional work experience.",

            "comment": "If you ask Alumni, you are really just getting outdated answers. I'm an alumni from the class of 2017, when they first changed the degree program to focus a little bit less on design, and I still managed to land an internship on Call of Duty as a designer my junior year. I personally decided programming was a more fulfilling path for me, so that's what I do now, but I feel confident that I could have found employment as a designer.\n\nBut that's besides the point, because they changed the degree even more so in 2018. Now, there is absolutely no overlap between BAGD and BSGD classes. BSGD take their own versions of design courses, which as far as I've seen, has REALLY helped with the drop out rates. If you want good information, you should contact the school and see if there is a BSGD student ambassador who will talk to you about their degree program (they would have just finished their junior year).\n\nLastly, I will just say that there is one thing that is consistent across all the BSGD versions: your game project classes. Putting it honestly, there is no standard curriculum for game design yet, it's just too young of an academic field, so just because you don't take the design classes that BAGDs take shouldn't automatically discredit you from being a designer. Also, there's nothing stopping you from taking those classes in the summer or whatever. \n\nI think the project classes are where you can really shine and focus on what you want to. My junior year, I worked as my team's design lead, despite being in a CS track. I believe that if you really put good work into your portfolio and focus on your projects, you can set yourself up for design success (especially because designer roles vary so much from studio to studio. Naughty Dog often prefers their designers have CS degrees) - but please do not take my word for it, ask a current BSGD.\n\nTL;DR: Alumni will not give you advice that actually reflects DigiPen anymore. Talk to a current student. If you want to focus on design while still getting your CS degree, its possible, you just need to really put in the work.",

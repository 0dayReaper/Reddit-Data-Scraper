I can't find anything that says they do on their page here: https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/homeschooled-applicants/\n\nI have my GED already, and I'm almost done writing my application essay, in case that helps.\n\nThanks guys,\nCollin\n\n*Update*\nJust wanted to let everyone know, I talked to admissions this morning.\nThey require either SAT or ACT test scores, and a GED.\n\nThanks everyone for your help!",

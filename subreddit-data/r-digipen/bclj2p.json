Those are the two most failed classes, and for our campus, failing the intro linear algebra course (compared to failing other classes) is statistically the best predictor of failing out of the degree. \n\nIf you want to get into a design mindset, read Design of Everyday Things. It's not nearly as important as making sure your math/CS are up to par, but it will help you see the world like a designer, which helps for those classes.",

All of that will help, generally, but what's important is that you learn what you are interested in.\n\nSpending time to learn what you are interested in helps to inform what kind of developer you want to be. It is far more important to understand that core reason than it is to study for the sake of what this degree demands. Personal opinon; many people enter digipen (singapore) without this self-awareness.\n\nWhat are you interested in learning? I can point you to resources.",

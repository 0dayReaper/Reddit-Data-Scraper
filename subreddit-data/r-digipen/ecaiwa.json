    "postText": "Heyo. Past DigiPen student here. I'm completing my Bachelor's at a traditional university. Because DigiPen is nationally accredited and not regionally accredited, the university did not automatically accept my DigiPen credits (but did accept the ones from my previous community college associate's). I am thinking of trying to petition the university to accept at least some of my DigiPen credits so I can finish my degree faster without an insane credit load for the next two quarters.\n\nWondering if anyone has had luck transferring DigiPen credits ***out***, to other colleges. If so, how did you manage to do so? Any advice on how to make my petition? TIA!",

I graduated in 2012, which is quite a while ago so I can't exactly speak to how the school is run now.\n\nCity-wise you would likely be in Redmond (if you can afford it or be somewhere farther out). As far as I know Redmond is still a safe area along with areas nearby so no worries about crime for the most part (Things could have changed? There are sites for checking crime statistics).\n\nIn the pacific northwest it is more often than not cloudy with no sun and potentially raining. Some people can be affected by how often the sun is NOT out so keep that in mind. (I personally loved it).\n\nWhen I started at DigiPen the best thing I did was join a study group which propelled me into game teams and carried me through my entire time at DigiPen. I made friends in that group that I'm still friends with to this day. I have also gotten my foot in the door at a few studios because of friends I met at DigiPen worked at those studios.\n\nFrom what I understand there is a forum for new students where you can potentially talk about getting an apartment together and whatnot.\n\nI'd need more specific question to go deeper though I might not be able to answer them given how long I have been out.\n\nSo, with all of that said I'm going to mention that while I wouldn't regret going to DigiPen it is stupid expensive. If you plan to finance your entire time at DigiPen through student loans it's going to be a struggle to get them paid off.\n\nGetting strapped with \\~$134,000 just from tuition and fees when you graduate really sucks.\n\nIf you leave DigiPen with one of the heavier programming degrees you'll likely be better off than others but it ends up landing on your shoulders to get the job that can actually pay that debt off. It will determine where you can work as well because you'll need a higher paying job to pay that debt.\n\n8 years after having graduated I still have a lot to pay on my student loans. I was going in as a designer though so the pay doesn't get decent until a few years in and even then it really depends on the studio and your location (low cost of living, MCOL, HCOL).\n\nHope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions.\n\nHopefully someone can talk about a more recent experience as well!\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm 17yr old student studying in korea.\nAs the College Scholastic Ability Test was approaching, I couldn't help thinking about the university. So, I have a few question for the Digipen students.\n\n1. How much is the tuition per semester?\n\n2. If I can go to a higher university in Korea, would it be better to avoid danger and stay in Korea?\n\n+The only way to get in Digipen in korea is entering Keimyung University which is a school almost impossible to get a local job after graduation, after five semesters of 'Digipen Game Engineering(below DGE)', certify each 80 TOEFL scores, 3.0 GPA or higher and tuition for 4 semesters(I have heard that it is expemsive than 50k USD). Then I can move to Digipen in Redmond.\nBut DGE in Keimyung is called 'trap'. In Korea, if people get enough grades to go to Digipen, most of them apply to departments with a higher employment rate in top-tier universities. Therefore, DGE is overflowing with people who couldn't go to the top universities. \n\n3. Can I afford the tuition as a part-time job? \n\n4. How much score do I have to get on the SAT to enter Digipen?\n\nThanks for your answer, and sorry for my poor English.",

            "comment": "PART TWO, continuation.\n\n3. The score you need seems pretty low, as in the case of Singapore Digipen, a below average score can get you into Digipen(a score many students may feel sad over if they got it). I guess they look at your past achievements? More of character than academics in any case.\n\n4. A degree is not that useful in the game industry as in others, even digipen's. This is especially true unless you want to work in US in the future, because a degree from a private university in another country specialising in games (programming or otherwise) really isn't that valuable in any industry, games or otherwise.\n\nSo, as long as you find a university with education comparable to Digipen, go there instead. Digipen is not the only game school, and it's not the best either(although it is good). \n\nHere's extra credits video on [how to find a good game school](https://youtu.be/nmdGZk-fF98).\n\nAs a korean citizen, you likely have financial aid from your own country(Like Singapore reduces 158k for international students to ~44k for singapore citizens). \n\nIf you wish to get into game design, the way to prove you're good at it is to make many good games to show to companies in the future, not a degree in game design. For game programming, same thing.\n\nYou may wish to take a traditional CS degree in Korea instead. Even if Digipen Redmond was in Korea and you were offered guaranteed entry with fees similar to other korean public universities, there would still be many factors to decide on whether or not you really should go to Digipen, with one of them being that if you do decide to go to Digipen, it's hard to find jobs in other industries(and it's not a guarantee you'll go into game design/programming anyways).\n\nBut no, Digipen Redmond is halfway across the world, you'll likely never see your family and friends most of the time(unless through video calls), you'll likely not have any free time, and even if you take 30% of your future $3500/month to pay off your loan, it'll take you ~17 years to pay it off(if your salary doesn't increase).\nAnd you have a high chance of dropping out with how tough it is, meaning you may have wasted your money and a year or two. \n\nAnd it's not like Digipen = Guaranteed entry, it just means you get a good game education that you can easily get in your gigantic country of Korea for far less with a degree that's worth more. You might even find a better game university than Digipen, given that it's not the best in the world( topuniversities.com doesn't seem to have Digipen on it's list in any case). In fact, if you go to a good local public university, you may have more time to develop your games portfolio which can actually increase your chance of getting into game companies(know that many people have gotten into game companies without a comprehensive education like digipen, instead teaching themselves).\n\nIn other words, not only will going to local public universities be comparable to Digipen's education(if you find a good school in traditional CS or in games), it might even boost your chances at getting into game companies if you're hard-working enough compared to not having the time to develop your own games in Digipen.\n\n\ntldr: If you have infinite money(17 years of paying off $1050 a month, with starting salary being ~3500/month without considering interest), don't really care about getting to see your family much for 4 years, confident about excelling in a private university known for it's very tough education with high drop out rates, don't mind getting a degree that is not that useful by itself in getting jobs in game industry or in other industries, all for an education you can find if you look hard enough in Korea(Korea is a big country) be it in traditional CS or in games, which might even be unnecessary given that you don't need to be an expert in games to get a game design/programming job(others have gotten such jobs without a single degree, let alone one in digipen), then maybe. Yes, just maybe even with all these conditions. You also have to consider the feelings of your family and friends of not being able to see you, and having to bear such a huge financial burden.\n\nIt's not like I have something against Digipen either. But here in Singapore, it's 1/4 the price at 44000 in total, in my own country with comparable education to Digipen Redmond, I get to see my family everyday, Digipen has a good reputation in the game industry(but remember that a degree is not that useful, they look at what you've done in creating games), and I still hesitate in deciding whether to go to my local Digipen or to choose a traditional CS at a good university instead. \n\nAnd know that my country is so small, so there isn't really any other options that are just as good or better in terms of teaching game design/programming unlike in your country where there are other universities with eudcation on games that may be just as good as Digipen for 1/4 the price of Digipen Redmond. \n\n\nHonestly, don't go to redmond. Not to singapore either, it's too expensive here as well for international students. Look in your own country, topuniversities.com may help in this(it's non-profit organisation that ranks universities based on their performance in various areas), much much much much cheaper, may be even better than Digipen, able to help you get a job easier in other industries(maybe even in the game industry with you having more free time) compared to a degree that's worth less than ones you can get in good public universities with an education that you can find in other public Korea universities that may be just as good or better.\n\n\n\nHonestly, don't go. You don't need a Digipen Redmond education to go into the game industry, just a good education in traditional CS or in game programming or something like that which you can find in your own public universities. You don't even need a degree, just work hard(although please do get one haha) at developing your game portfolio, they don't see what degrees you have. Don't go, it's not worth the effort, the immense debt you'll have, the time you have to spend away from your family and friends.\n\nYou don't need to go to digipen, in korea or in redmond. And I would suggest listening to others in that going to Digipen in korea is a trap, because they know much more than I(and many strangers online) do. \n\nI've spent &gt;30mins on this, just to tell you; don't go. Stay in Korea, not to go to Digipen Korea, but to go to a good public university instead. Not only is it \"safer\", but it's a much better choice. Even if you \"risk it\", spend 200000 and go to Digipen Redmond for 4 years, not really seeing your family, what can it offer you that the 100+ universities in Korea cannot?\n\nEven if the only university in the world that will accept you is Digipen Redmond, you might as well not get a degree. Just spend 4 years being as hard-working as digipen students designing and making games for your games portfolio, because game companies don't care for your degree and a Digipen degree won't do much outside of games.\n\nPlease do get a degree though, just in other universities(not digipen) in korea. It's not worth it otherwise.",

            "comment": "1. Based on the top comment, it's 48000/year which seems about right. \nThat said,\n\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/admissions/tuition-and-fees\n\nsays that fees are 38000/year without including renting a place to stay and eat and stuff like that for international students(although something about filling up an addavit form for certain non-US residents[I'm not sure if you're counted in] to pay 34700/year instead).\n\n38000/year is the fee based on \"16-22 credits flat rate\" \nSomething about the average student taking 17-20 credits.\n\nWith the ~16k given by US department of education (the cost of books, on-campus rooms and board) \n\n[You can google search digipen redmond fees](https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-samsung&amp;ei=Vi1IYN3MC4jt9QOTu4yADA&amp;q=digipen+redmond+fees&amp;oq=digipen+redmond+fees&amp;gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBQgAEM0COgIIKToECAAQRzoFCC4QkwI6BggAEBYQHjoFCCEQoAE6BAghEBVQ8CFYhitgkixoAHABeACAAW-IAf4CkgEDNC4xmAEAoAEBwAEB&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp)\n\nit'll be 54000/year, or 216000 in total when you come out.\n\nHere might be different [Digipen Cost of Attendance](https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/financial-aid/cost-of-attendance)\n\n\nAs for the financial aid [Here](https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/financial-aid/how-to-apply-for-financial-aid#eligibility)\n\ndon't expect a good chance of getting financial aid, because you're not a US citizen. The something 60% students get financial aid as seen on google i think also includes federal aid(most probably), and you won't be getting federal aid. Digipen is also incredibly tough, so expecting to get ahead of other students your age to get financial support from digipen(I don't think this support is a scholarship even if you do get it).\n\n2. Can you pay for digipen using a part-time job? No. First of all, you can't work 8h/day for 6 days a week, and I agree with the top comment. \n\nAssuming you spend 10h on digipen stuff like projects after school, get 7h of sleep, 2h of stuff like eating showering travel to work etc., it'll leave you with ~5h of time. \n\nKnow that a 5h part-time job is rare to come by, let alone one that specifically fits your schedule so perfectly.\n\nAnd sometimes not just 10h, but maybe even 12h or something if you need to study(digipen is hard) or do projects. \n\nYou likely won't find a job like that.\n\nYou won't be able to spend much time developing your game portfolio even if you do get a job that allows you to come in anytime, whenever, and get off days when you ask, which is the most crucial in getting a job(a degree isn't worth much).\n\n\nAfter all that, $10/h for a 5hr part-time job with such specific hours that is close to where you stay seems reasonable. If you work 6 days a week, it'll be $1400/month. You have to work almost everyday for all 4 years which Will hurt your studies and portfolio and which Will not be feasible given the importance of group projects in Digipen. All to pay off ~1/3 of your loan.\n\n\nBetter to not to. Not even sure if you can find a job like that. \n\nPART ONE, next part below.",

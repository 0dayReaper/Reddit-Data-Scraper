You make a first impression in someone's mind in about 7 seconds. That is how long it takes you to judge someone based off of their appearance, the way they talk, and other information. \n\nTip 2: Don't give up before you start!\n\nWhen you see this huge project infront of you, don't falter or hide in a hole! Take time to plan it out and flesh out your idea or a way to confront this beast! Think before you do!\n\nTip 3: For any CS students, don't go to sleep in class! \n\nIt's a hard one I know. But the pace of the CS classes are truly at light speed. Take notes of the labs and assignments! READ everything on the page before you start programming! \n\nTip 4: Designers, play test at minimum 3 times, and change something atleast once from each play test.\n\nThe game you make is most likely going to be bad the first time around. You may not see it but trust me, it will be bad. Play test to make it better! Make sure to trade play tests!\n\nTip 5: Please ask for help!\n\nA lot of people are scared to ask for help. Do not be one of those. Always ask if you are stuck on a problem longer than 15 minutes. All the upperclassmen are willing to help! If not they will direct you to someone that can help! Tutors are on the 3rd floor everyday willing to help you on literally anything!",

I recently switched from BSCSGD to BSCSRTIS, and it's restored my motivation to work. Rather than dreading the design classes, I'm just looking forward to more programming. That said, if you don't like programming, but you HATE design, switching to doing more programming might not help you. ",

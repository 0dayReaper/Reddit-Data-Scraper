    "postText": "Hi, I'm planning on applying to DigiPen and have started my application essay, since there is no word limit mine is about 1360 words. However, I understand that even if there is no limit it is probably not the best for it to be too long. So I was wondering if this length may be too long and I need to shorten it, or if it is an alright length.",

I can't speak to how its handled now, but I can for sure say that at least when I did it they read everything I sent.",

            "comment": "A 3 page admissions essay is probably longer than most (but I'm no expert).  That doesn't mean it is too long. If it takes you 1360 words to say what you want to say, then it is the perfect length.  The question is, are you really saying something with all 1360 words? If you are filling your essay with \"deadwood\" and repeating yourself, then it is too long.\n\nFor reference, I half-assed my admissions essay and wrote it the day it was due. I said who I am, what I've been doing with my life, what I want to do with my life, and why I thought Digipen could help me achieve my goals. It was 362 words, and it was terrible. I never finalized submitting it on the website (I think there was a final confirmation to submit, or a \"save\" button or something), and found out a month after the application deadline that they were waiting on my essay. They still let me in. \n\nI have nothing to back this up, and could be completely wrong, but I feel like the admissions essay is more important if you've really got something to say.  If you have good grades or a good portfolio or anything else they want, a bad essay probably won't weed you out. If you have struggled with your grades etc, a stellar essay can keep you in contention. \nAll that said, my experiences rely on my sample size of 1, and results may vary.  But my advice is to not sweat it. If you read your essay and say \"yup that's what I want to say\" then just submit it and don't stress about the length.",

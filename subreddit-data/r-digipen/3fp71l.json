I'm wondering if anyone can recommend some things I could do/read to get up to speed before I take these classes",

(linear algebra helps too)  \n  \nHere are the two books that I highly recommend:  \n[3D Math Primer for Graphics And Game Development](http://www.amazon.com/Primer-Graphics-Development-Wordware-Library/dp/1556229119/) by Fletcher Dunn &amp; Ian Parberry  \n[Essential Math for Games and Interactive Applications](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Mathematics-Games-Interactive-Applications/dp/0123742978/) by James Van Verth &amp; Lars Bishop  \n  \nI also recommend:  \n[Real-Time Rendering](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Third-Tomas-Akenine-Moller/dp/1568814240/) by Tomas Akenine-Moller, Eric Haines, and Naty Hoffman  \nThis is like an encyclopedia of computer graphics and techniques for games, touching a broad variety of topics.",

As others stated, it would be wise to brush up some Linear Algebra. My two cents.",

However, from my perspective, it was a rather unpleasant book for me, but I came through by the help of additional tutorials, such as\n\n - [Durian Software's Tutorials](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Chapter-1:-The-Graphics-Pipeline.html)\n - [Render Hell - Simon schreibt](http://simonschreibt.de/gat/renderhell/)\n\nI would also recommend that you check /r/computergraphics for additional resources.",

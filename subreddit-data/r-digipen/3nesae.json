    "postText": "Hey, y'all. I'm a current senior applying to DigiPen's BA in Game Design. I have some questions regarding applying, however, hopefully y'all can help me out. \n\n 1.\t How diverse is BAGD? Have there been any issues regarding the LGBT community or race? I'm black, biologically female, but genderqueer &amp; pansexual. \n\n 2.\t What programming languages are taught? Currently in AP Computer Science II, but it's all Javascript, which I have a hard time with (I'm alright with html and Ruby though, haven't started any C yet). \n\n 3.\t When is a good time to apply for fall 2016? I'm also applying to another school for early action in November.\n \n 4.\t I'm taking SAT in November and ACT in December for the first time. What scores on those tests is best? I know only one is required and DP claims to not care which one you take, but which is better for BAGD? \n\n 5.\t On the essay, where it basically asks why I want to go there, is it best to just answer the question exactly or should I add in my future plans and passion for games? Should I also send in my personal statement (Its mainly about LGBT representation in gaming)? \n\n 6.\t I have a chronic blood disease - should I include that in the application or just save that for the disabilities department? \n\n 7.\t My GPA has always been above 3.5. I've taken a bunch of AP, dual credit, IB and Honors courses at a college preparatory, summer engineering program and technology magnet school (as you can see, nerdy guys aren't really a new thing for me to encounter lol) . Is this adequate or overkill? \n\n 8.\t Still unsure of which teachers to ask for recommendations. Maybe my film teacher (he knows my work ethic on major projects, did film festival a few times)? Or digital media teacher that has experience in the game industry? What core teachers should I ask? \n\nPlease answer as many as you can, its probably too many questions but I want to make sure I'm doing everything right for my top college option :D. Thanks alot and have a nice day! ",

            "comment": "BSGD Alumni here.\n\n1) BAGD is fairly diverse. I have heard stories about some people in the LGBT community having troubles while at DigiPen(through the club at DigiPen), but I didn't pursue more questioning so I'm not certain if it was directly related to the school or just having to deal with other issues.  \n  \n2) Python/Zilch is going to be a lot like Javascript. C/C++ will be even more lower level which means you'll have more complexities to consider. Having a general sense of programming though will definitely give you a leg up coming into DigiPen.  \n  \n3) What others have said. been too long for me to know.  \n  \n4) Same as above. Been too long.  \n  \n5) All the above. Showing your passion is most important in my opinion.  \n  \n6) Hopefully someone can give you more info on this. I would call the school directly and see where they send you.  \n  \n7) Overkill indeed, haha. But always good as you'll hit the ground running when starting DigiPen.  \n  \n8) Use both? Don't know how many references they want, but the two you mentioned sound just fine. Any teachers who have an understanding of your skill and work ethic is a great choice.  \n  \nNot sure if anybody has said this yet, but be absolutely sure you want to attend DigiPen. If you plan to take out federal and private student loans it's pretty expensive and it can be suffocating to be in as much debt as DigiPen can put you in. I know this because I'm in a lot of debt due to DigiPen. While I have loved every job that I have had once I graduated from DigiPen it took roughly 2 years for me to get to a state where I feel financially stable.\n\nAlso, be absolutely certain you want to specifically go into the BAGD degree and not the BSGD degree or another more programming focused degree. Having a strong programming background as a designer is highly sought after and can get you jobs where you might not otherwise. I say this because what you have said so far makes me think you're interested in more programmer heavy stuff.\n\nOutside of all of this. I feel that if you really want to get into the industry, Digipen can get you there it just might be more expensive.\n\nGood luck on your journey! And feel free to ask more questions.\n\nEDIT: grammar",

I understand the basics at least, how to declare things, user input, etc. But it's the more advanced stuff I'm shaky with. I'm going to start really pushing to understand java now as well as delving more into python and other languages when I can. \n\n5. I've also asked someone else, but multiple perspectives would be appreciated. I just finished my essay this morning but I'm pretty unsure about it, perhaps it's too emotional or doesn't get my point across? I've reread it so many times that I don't even know what to think of it anymore. \n\nI'm sure about DigiPen. I plan on getting scholarships and grants though. I was certain about BAGD,  though I see your point on BSGD and BAID was brought up as well. \n\nThanks so much for your help! ",

No pressure really, everything you're doing now will just put you in a better spot when you enter DigiPen.\n\n2) Definitely try to keep some form of consistent meaning in the paper along with showing your passion for the game industry. \n\nPursue those things as much as possible. I can't say enough how I wish I would have searched more for scholarships and grants. Your future self will thank you for doing it.\n  \nOne thing I will say about BAGD is that it always felt a little shaky degree-wise compared to the BSGD degree. Never seemed like DigiPen had the right formula for it(hence the change it is going to get to convert to BAID). BUT, every BAGD I know has obtained a job. They are in the industry. Some more successful than others, but that's to be expected.",

            "comment": "1. I am an RTIS and don't know about the diversity of the BAGD program. I'm also a freshman so I haven't been here too long. That said, Digipen is a pretty friendly place, and I haven't heard of any issues with discrimination.\n\n2. Like I said, I'm not BAGD, so I don't know too much about the classes you will be taking. If you are expecting to be doing a lot of programming, you may be looking at the wrong program. I believe BAGD goes over some scripting, but the degree is primarily design, not much programming. If you are interested in programming, I would recommend BSCSGD or RTIS. BSCSGD is essentially a hybrid between BAGD and RTIS. You will get both design and programming. A designer who can program/script is vastly more hire-able than one who cannot. Even if you choose BAGD, you should still put in the effort to learn as much scripting as possible.\n\n3. I applied in December. I don't think it matters a ton, I wouldn't apply any later than February, just to be safe, but I'm pretty sure many people applied and were accepted even later then that.\n\n4. I doubt they have any kind of secret preference, and I doubt one is preferable for BAGD. As for score, only admissions knows what kind of score they are looking for.\n\n5. I would just answer the question just as it is asked. Cover why you want to make games, why you are interested in Digipen, why you want to be a BAGD, etc. Basically just convey the fact that you are passionate and know what you're getting into, because Digipen is a tough school.\n\n6. I would save it for disability support services.\n\n7. You will definitely be fine in the academic department.\n\n8. If you were applying for a BS program I would say math, but for BAGD, I really have no idea. Just find someone who will say good things about you.",

I'm way more interested in the design side of things. Though, I don't want to show up with no programming knowledge at all. And yeah, I'm interested in learning more coding but not so much that I would major in it specifically, even if it is more marketable. \nThanks again for your help! ",

I'm more worried about getting harassed about my identity while I'm minding my business in the lab or something. Nothing I can't handle, but it is rather unpleasant.  \n\nThanks a lot! \n\n",

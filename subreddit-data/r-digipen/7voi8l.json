    "postText": "I'll be going to the U.K to do CS and other than the general skills I'll learn, the course has very little content associated with gamedev. I can't attend DigiPen for undergraduate study and so I decided that doing a masters there instead would be a great way to strictly focus on gamedev. I hear stories of students who make It into Bungie, Activision, Naughty Dog, Valve etc shortly after they graduate (undergrads) and was curious whether that's the same for postgraduate students. To add on to that, what prior knowledge would I need for the course (The only progress I'll make would be through self-study. Having an idea of what I should be studying would be a huge benefit)?\n\nEdit: DP Redmond btw",

            "comment": "Greetings, If you have the money to attend then by all means do the graduate program. Otherwise I'd say you're better off making things on the side  while you're doing stuff in the U.K.\n\nNot to say that the program won't teach you what you need to know but it's very expensive to attend. It's ~$50000 for the 2-year program. That's just tuition, no living costs there.\n\nMy advice would be to pop open unity, or Unreal 4 or Game maker(wherever you want to start) and see if you can make something with it. There are plenty of tutorials online to get you started with all of the above game engines.\n\nI'm working in the AAA space and I consistently hear from my lead that if you can just show him that you have made a game and that you can talk about the development of that game that you are a leg up over others.\n\nBut, I'm also on the technical design side of things so I'll admit that my knowledge of programming languages and hardware doesn't need to be as robust as if you were to be shooting for an engine programming role or something as equally low level.\n\nSo all of this depends on what you want to be doing in the industry and how much debt you're willing to take on.\n\nI'm just under $100,000 in debt now and while I love my job it really sucks having a 1/4th of my monthly earnings going to student loans (about $1000 for me).\n\nAll in all, consider what I have said, determine what you want to do in the game industry and see if you can make that happen without attending a graduate program.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

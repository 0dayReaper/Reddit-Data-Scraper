    "postText": "I read in another post that one of the benefits of being an RA is free rent in student housing. However, I've heard in student housing at some other colleges, RAs are also sometimes offered alternative housing arrangements: like having their own bedroom in a two or three bedroom space (rather than having to share a bedroom), or even living in their own one bedroom space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnder the \"Housing Costs and Amenities\" section on Digipen's website, it lists a housing arrangement that is 3 bedrooms, 1.5 bathrooms, and 5 residents which must mean that 1 of the 5 residents gets their own bedroom, and it states \"This configuration is only available in special circumstances.\" Maybe those \"special circumstances\" are if 1 of the 5 residents is an RA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I'm interested in being an RA either way. Free rent is free rent, and beggars can't be choosers. I was just curious.",

            "comment": "As a current RA, I can tell you that the only housing options are the ones available to all students. RAs are always given the most expensive housing option for free (in my year, it was a 2 bed 2 bath 4 people).\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the \"special circumstances\" are kept for those with disabilities or what not, not for RAs. \n\nI do know that the Housing Staff is looking at changing it so that RAs will live with other RAs, and they might be put in a 2 bed 2 bath with only 2 people in the apt. However this is not confirmed. \n\nIf you have any more questions about housing feel free to Dm me.",

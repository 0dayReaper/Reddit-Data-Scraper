    "postText": "hey so I'm a recent high school graduate attending a community college and my dream school is digipen (I want to work in game design). My parents have a large income but can't help too much with paying for college bc of the expenses of having 5 kids, but their large income still limits how much financial aide I can get. And I need a cosigner for normal loans and theyre not willing to be the cosigner. So my options for paying for such an expensive school like digipen are limited. Is my dream pretty much dead or is there something else I can do to pay for school?",

            "comment": "Hello, I graduated from DigiPen in 2012 through the BSGD program.\n\nSo design with programming.\n\nWhile the school will prepare you for the game industry a lot of what you get out of a college program is what you put into it.\n\nIf you're passionate about designing games I'd say you should just crack open a mod toolkit for a game you enjoy and see if you can build anything with it. If you're feeling super motivated open up Unreal 4 or Unity and see if you can make something with it. Or just start with game maker and make some 2D games.\n\nI know a few people who got into the industry by doing this.\n\nAlso, a lot of what the industry is looking for is experience making games (makes sense right?). While DigiPen does give you the experience of making games through their game projects the things you learn in those game projects are often through trial and error. Sure, you receive feedback from the instructors but playtesting your game can get you similar feedback.\n\nSo, if you're dead set on going through a design program at a school consider other schools. University of Utah has one and so does University of Southern California.\n\nBoth are state schools which means you may have more opportunities for scholarships.\n\nI honestly didn't have the motivation to pursue game development without the kick in the butt that DigiPen gives you but that also comes at a cost.\n\nI'm currently somewhere in the ballpark of $100,000 in debt and while I now have a job that can pay those loan payments it is not fun having to pay around $1000 a month for loans.\n\nI'd suggest seriously considering pursuing this on your own time as when you do get into the industry you'll be better off in the long run. No crushing student debt.\n\nIf you're living in a large metropolitan area there are typically indie meetups and things of that sort. A great thing to go to if you're looking to get some advice from people who are currently making games.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

Perhaps community college first and do as much as you can before transferring in? It is an expensive school, but there are options if you really want it. Definitely look into cheaper options though as well =)! ",

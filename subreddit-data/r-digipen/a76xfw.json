    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI've already read through a lot of this subreddit and I wanted to throw my questions in here as well.\n\nI know there are a lot of alternative universities for CS and programming/game design but I was wondering if anyone knew of alternatives for Digipens BFA program? Like other game art programs in the country that might be as good but not incredibly expensive?\n\nI want to be a game artist, willing to learn it all. 3D, rigging, lighting--and I'm prepared for the workload. I'm just concerned about the money, for obvious reasons. I don't have anyone to pay my tuition. It's gonna be FAFSA, scholarship grinds, and loans.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Know of any alternative degrees or is Digipen just the best choice for a game artist? Do you BFAs like your program and feel confident in the loans you're taking out? \n\nLemme know guys. Thanks in advance. \n",

So geared to digital and 3D art. Everything is either straight CGI or straight fine art. Or just animation without the design elements\n\nDo you like the program so far? Feel like you're getting what you are paying for? ",

BFA when I was there had some good stuff, but we're mostly focused on studio animation rather than games - the links between the art program and the premire game project classes were nonexistent. My junior game team managed to barter with the administration to get our artists actual credits, but I'm not sure how much that idea progressed since then.\n\nOne thing I would recommend looking at are the costs per credit for non-core classes at the nearby community college and which ones are transferable. I think you could save a lot of money by splitting that difference.",

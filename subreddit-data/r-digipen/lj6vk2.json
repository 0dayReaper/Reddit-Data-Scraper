    "postText": "Hi! I got into Digipen and had applied for the BSCSGD. After reading some of the previous questions on the sub, I just wanted to clear up the differences between BSCSGD and RTIS. Will the degree in BSCSGD hinder my employment opportunities in the industry? Are there very major differences between RTIS and BSCSGD? Is there any chance that I can change my program if required? Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.",

            "comment": "I entered as a BSGD and found it wasnt for me. I switched to RTIS after freshman year and eventually to BSCS my junior year which ended up being the right fit. It's possible to switch at any point but the earlier you decide the simpler it is since more specialized classes happen the deeper in you get. \n\nThe major difference is BSGD take game design classes, where RTIS study how to implement graphics and physics simulation (BSCS focus more on general topics like algorithm analysis and also things like AI and networking). You can theoretically take some of the other programs early courses as electives if it's interesting to you, which is one of the reasons it isn't too hard to switch early.\n\nI can't really speak to the question about employability since I only went thru the process as a CS major, but I don't think it really made a huge difference. I think the BSGD students had better luck finding jobs in specifically the games industry but a good programmer can generally find work and I know don't know of anyone from my class with a CS that didn't find work.   Some places like Google though just don't like hiring digi grads though, so if the place is like that they won't hire you no matter which letters you go for.",

It didn't necessarily train all that much better, it just culled very aggressively, which is going to bring its averages up.\n\n2017's a weird anomaly year both for the curriculum and graduating into the pandemic, so I think the real test will be seeing how 2018-present cohorts do when they graduate. It'll be interesting to see if the new BSGDs have enough design for it to be useful.",

            "comment": "When you get to DigiPen I'm sure Ellinger or someone else will show the \"degree separation chart\" or whatever it is. Basically shows the engineering degree on one side and then the art degree on the other and the rest of the degrees fall along that line from programmery stuff to art stuff.  \n\n\nIt's simple to go between two degrees that butt up against each and harder the farther the degree is separated from the one you want.  \n\n\nSo, with all of that said. Yes, it would be very easy to go from BSGD to RTIS.  \n\n\nAs for employment it really depends on what you want to get into. As a designer you will usually by default make less than a programmer. I think in 2012/2013 when I started I was making \\~$35,000 a year at a mid-level studio. I have since moved up to \\~$100,000+ working at a AAA studio due to seniority and whatnot but it took years to reach 6 figures. It's highly dependent on the company you work for as well.  \n\n\nThere are inherently less design jobs than programming jobs typically so your options are more limited. Your ability to program opens up more design positions though.  \n\n\nI would say you're better off than BAGD but likely not as well off as one of the RTIS or engineering students. I'd imagine the BSCS has a solid track record as well. This is all anecdotal from what I have seen, I don't know the hard numbers. DigiPen can likely provide those if you ask them about it.  \n\n\nWith all of the above said I'm running off of my experience from 2012 so I imagine the BSGD degree has improved since then and potentially gives you a stronger ability to get into a gameplay programmer role so that avenue may be open to you as well.  \n\n\nHope this helps. Make sure you complete the program if you do decide to go to DigiPen. You'll need the job after to pay off that debt (if you don't have scholarships or parents that were able to save up to cover your schooling).  \n\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

The ones that graduated before us transferred into the degree I think.\n\nIt was a little rough in some regards so I imagine things have just gotten better now. Not to say I didn't feel prepared for what I have done in the industry just that it could have been even better than it was. EDIT: (This was before BSCSGD had the 'CS' in it but they only added it because they felt it better described the degree, we still had a lot of programming courses)",

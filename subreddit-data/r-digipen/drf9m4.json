            "comment": "Hello, keep in mind that the amount that is made in any given location is dependent on the cost of living in that area. All of the below is in the US.\n\nWith that said my first job was around 2012 and I was taking home \\~$1300 a paycheck which came every 2 weeks so \\~$33800 per year.\n\nThis was in Seattle and it was definitely an entry level position.\n\nAs I have worked in the industry for quite some time my income has climbed since then.\n\nNext design job I was taking home \\~$1500 per paycheck bi-weekly again so \\~$39000 per year and that was at a mobile company. (Seattle)\n\nI left that job for a job at a AAA company in California where I have worked ever since. Started around $55000 and have climbed to $95000 given the position I now have. The pay really depends on what type of company you're working at as well. Up until the AAA company I was working at mid-level studios.\n\nFigured I'd just lay it all out so you can see a progression. In the above time frame I was laid off 2 times and once had to take a QA job to pay the bills. So it can be rough but if you just keep at it and keep doing design things you'll most likely do fine.\n\nHope this helps!",

At the time I left Seattle (2014) the industry up there seemed really volatile for the jobs I thought I was qualified for so I took the gig for the AAA company.  \n\n\nHaven't left the AAA company. Every company I have worked for up in Seattle has gone under except one which was Bungie and I was an AI tester there which is why I didn't stay. (Wasn't getting paid what I needed to be paid to cover my loans and other expenses).  \n\n\nI'm not sure how stable it is up there now for designers. Usually the higher up you are the more insulated you are but that's also not always true. Depends on what the company needs/wants when things get rough.\n\nTo be fair as well though all of the companies I worked for as a designer up in Seattle were mid-level studios so they were usually at the mercy of whoever they're publisher was. The company I work for now is not as tied to that concept.",

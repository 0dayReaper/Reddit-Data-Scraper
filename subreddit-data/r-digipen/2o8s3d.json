    "postText": "I'm a little confused on some date information for upcoming semesters. From what I've read, it almost seems like it's changed recently. Rather than risk potentially confusing myself further, I figured I'd just ask.\n\nFebruary is the start date for new semesters, and September is the cut-off date for application acceptance. Right?\n\nSo if I'm looking to enroll in the semester after the upcoming one, I'd have to be accepted by this coming September, and in class by February 2016?",

Fall semester tends to have classes that are required for a few Spring semester classes.\n\nAnyway, if you are wanting to start in the fall of next year (2015) then you would apply now essentially(at least, that is what the website says).\n\n",

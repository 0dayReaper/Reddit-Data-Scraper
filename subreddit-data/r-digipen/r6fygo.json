What are the most important qualities that Digipen is looking for?\n\nI\u2019ve worked on mod projects outside of school, I\u2019m willing to endure Digipen\u2019s  curriculum, and I\u2019m primarily motivated by a desire to just make games, because I think making a games/mod projects is inherently fun. What else is important?",

Since all the essays are personal, I can only speak from my experience, which was to show your passion anyway you can. I talked about the games I played when I was younger and how that gave me a sense of adventure and joy. I hope to deliver that same experience to the younger generation. Same passion, for games, but I took a different route. I think your essay will do well! Good luck!",

DigiPen definitely cultivates that. Whether somebody takes to that or not is another matter.\n\nThere are definitely terrible teachers though and no matter what school you go to you're probably going to run into one for your learning style. Some teachers may just fail to teach you things that you feel they should have taught you.\n\nThis is where someone would say \"but I'm paying for this, they should be teaching me\". The thing is, they are except it's not in the way you might think. They are preparing you for the industry, though they might not realize it. When a producer or lead asks you to do something they aren't going to tell you how to do it they expect you to figure that out and potentially who you need to talk to to accomplish the task.\n\nI have had about a 2 week ramp up with every job that I have had in the industry. All of them threw me in the deep end with some documentation and expected me to accomplish things. These are junior level to mid-level positions as well. Some gave me tests to complete while others just waited for me to come up with something that I could add to the game and I would focus on developing that. \n\nThough really I do feel like DigiPen is half intentional and the other half is haphazard. It works though for the programming degrees as far as I can tell. The art degrees are still shaky it seems. Though I do know more than a few artists from DigiPen who are working at high-end studios. That could be survivor-bias.\n\nAnyway. I went off into the weeds with this post. I just feel that the people on 8chan are super salty over a situation that they have complete control over. DigiPen is very much a school where you have to fail a lot before you become successful, it's not just going to land in your lap. (EDIT: This is a legitimate problem though since you must fail fast enough so that you can update your schoolwork before it is due. This is possible it just takes dedication)\n\nDon't be afraid to fail, that's how learning happens and how people can become successful.\n\nMaybe things have gotten worse since I attended though.",

Or do your work in a timely fashion without stressing+lack of sleep ease?  \n\nIn hindsight the past the 3 years weren't hard for me. I am biased towards my degree though, but I see people who put minimal effort and are getting by with ease in every degree minus art. I personally just made extremely poor decisions where I would not manage everything well so things ended up being due roughly the same time. Which in turn made me stress out. As for sleep only like a couple times I've done with 4 hours of sleep due to assignments otherwise I usually get 8. It blows my mind that people are staying up to finish their assignments when they couldve done it a week ago. Top it off since you're not well rested makes you do poorly and then they complain about their grades. Oh well  \n\nCollege isn't meant to be 'hard' even if claude said that in the first day. It terms of difficulty it's like a roller coaster where the peak is 5-6 semester. It's to get you to learn the material that'd benefit for you in your degree with some bullshit gen ed to be 'well rounded'. Most professors aren't out to get you, despite what many believe. ",

Oh and staying up late many times for game projects, but that's how it goes when you're working on something you like doing.\n\nRollercoaster is definitely the right word for it as well. People constantly make the mistake of assuming that the course load isn't going to ramp up through the semester or when you move up a grade. It's a bell curve to some extent on a semester basis and through the grades as well. Start out simple as a Freshmen and then when you hit Senior year you're looking for a job so you are intentionally given less homework to allow you to search. ",

The CS classes themselves are pretty awesome, but you're still teaching yourself how to do everything you need to do to make a good game engine.

Maybe it doesn't exist anymore. There are also upper classmen to pester about developing an engine. I assume that game classes may have gone overboard with expectations?\n\n&gt; Yeah, well if that's the case, why even go to DigiPen? Why not just take some CS classes at your local community college?\n\nGoing to a community college is definitely an option, but I feel like you would be even worse off if you were going to attempt to make a game engine. You don't have access to the petri dish of DigiPen. Upperclassmen and the like. Suppose you could develop something in Unreal. Totally viable strategy. My lead has said that if someone were to simply attempt to make a game in some engine and was able to show their process to him that he would atleast give them a chance of getting a job.\n\n&gt; If you're a GD student, it really sucks to find out that all the terminology you learned in GAT class freshman year\n \nThe terminology thing does sound annoying. I don't know where he gets his information or if it's legit though the last I heard the design teachers were trying to come up with a way to describe games in a universal way so it could be a more concrete field of study. That takes iteration and sadly the students are the casualties. They should probably have a buffer or something to test out their new terminology.\n\nFor Game Design I came into the program right when it was created and it was definitely a shitshow at times but I decided to seek my own value in the school and push to be better. I don't regret that choice at all. But leaving is another choice and it sounds like it was right for your situation.\n\n&gt; If you're both (BSCSGD), may God have mercy on your soul.\n\nLots of salt in that statement I feel. Mercy was most certainly not given to me but I'm happy to be working for a well known AAA studio now. Took a few design jobs to get the opportunity though.\n\n&gt; UNLESS YOU ARE PAYING FOR SCHOOL OUT OF POCKET. IN WHICH CASE FAILURE IS KIND OF A BIG DEAL.\n\nI did. I'm paying off those loans right now. I completed the degree in the normal 4-year cycle and took out loans for it every single year. It sucks having tons of debt. That's actually one of the issues I have with the school. It's super expensive and whoever is choosing to go better be damn sure that they are going to finish. Go somewhere else if there is any doubt in attending DigiPen. There are cheaper options as well that might just take more motivation to accomplish but are still viable. A community college CS degree being one of them as you said.\n\nI also don't mean that you should fail classes I mean you should iterate over your assignments and have people test them. I'm more talking about the game project classes along with GAT here.\n\nEDIT: Just adding things to round out some sentences.",

Good luck now make a game\", I'd demand a refund on that book because it didn't really tell me how to make a video game. But it's not a book I bought, it's two years of DigiPen. For the money I paid for those two years, I should not have had to go to GAM150 club just to learn what the hell I was supposed to do (GAM150 is Zero now, I hear, which is almost more ridiculous to me) or actively seek out upperclassman help. Not because I want to overachieve and make the best game ever or anything, but just because I want to do what is expected of me.\n\nI feel like this is something that a lot of people, myself included do not expect going into DigiPen. It seems like most people, when they learn this, just \"roll with the punches\" and continue to say how good of a school DigiPen is instead of actually raising awareness of these issues.\n\nIf the expectations for your finished games were much, much lower (to the point of being what I'd actually expect out of students who just learned C++ a couple of semesters ago), I would have significantly less issues with DigiPen. Once I started to realize \"oh hey, they just want these games to be really good and flashy so they can put them on the monitors and tout them as the new Narbacular Drop or Tag or Perspective or whatever\", I got really, really jaded. Especially when Ellinger started throwing in new requirements to the rubric, such as \"game must be able to play itself (automated testing)\" or whatever. (Eventually these became not required, I think, but it was a heart attack when the new rubric dropped like 3 weeks before GAM200 ended.)\n\nMaybe DigiPen just wasn't for me. I taught myself a ton of programming stuff before attending, to the point of making my own (naive) game engines in C# and such. I guess I expected that, for the money I was paying, I would be retaught the things I already knew, but better, because a professor is teaching it instead of me just reading stuff online or in books, and deeper, because you'd actually learn how to make a game instead of just piecing together how to do it yourself, online. This ended up being true for the CS classes, for the most part; Mead's C/C++ classes and some of the math classes were top-notch, exactly what I expected. I just ended up feeling like everything else at the school was a huge joke.\n\nIf you're a BSGD graduate, I want to ask you something and I promise I don't mean to be sarcastic or rude at all: do you feel like your \"game design knowledge\" that you actually learned from GAT classes has helped you in any way professionally? Because I constantly feel like I could summarize two years' worth of GAT classes into, like, a short book. Looking back on everything I learned in two years, it seems like I just basically learned:\n\n* basic \"game design\" elements like probability math (just knowing it exists and thinking about it is pretty important)\n* Ellinger's flavor-of-the-year way of classifying games and engagement types or whatever\n* basic knowledge of how game engines work from a designer perspective (as a programmer, that class was pretty uninformative, but for the BAGDs I thought the class was great)\n* The Intensity Curve, etc.\n\nLike, is there some later-on knowledge that you learn that's amazing? I really hated feeling like, as someone who goes out of their way to try as many different types of games (analog and digital) as possible, and think about how they're designed while I try them, DigiPen's GD program seemed largely unnecessary. (EDIT: Rereading this sentence makes me sound like the kind of person who thought DigiPen would be all playing games or whatever; this is absolutely not the case. I just mean that I do think very critically about game design when I play games, much as an aspiring cinematographer might think more critically about the way a given film is shot in the way that you or I would not.) And again, these things I did learn were all valuable things... but they are things that I could easily read in a $50 book, the classes themselves weren't amazing to experience firsthand or anything, *especially* for the asking price.\n\nAs I said elsewhere in this thread:\n\n&gt;In my last year of attending school, we had a game design class where the professor, who still teaches at DigiPen, paraphrased a YouTube video about game mechanics in one class. That was the whole class. He played the demo game attached to \"The Art of Screen Shake\", and paraphrased the video. I paid a lot of money for that class period. Holcomb tells you to do the math, and I did. I could've watched that YouTube video and gained equally as much information as having him explain it to me, without paying the \"Early Access\" fee to be in the GD program at DigiPen. I say \"Early Access\" because if the RTIS program is a decent Steam game that takes some work to get the settings perfect but is otherwise pretty good, the GD programs are Early Access titles that crash every few minutes and get patched four times a year without anything seeming to really improve.\n\nThat was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.",

Plus, I was so focused on getting things done I wasn't thinking about much else. But, that choice paid off since I had the opportunity of working with a great team of people for the rest of my time at DigiPen.\n\n&gt;  For the money I paid for those two years, I should not have had to go to GAM150 club\n\nTo be honest it sounds like GAM 150 is turning into some horrific hurdle that is used to \"weed\" out people. GAM 150 used to be a game made completely in ascii and to tell you the truth those games were awesome. I remember the first year people started doing real 2D games in that class and I just thought that it was insane that the students were doing that. Sounds like things have just continued to escalate and become a requirement. Though I do feel like the students at DigiPen go hand-in-hand with the learning process. Not to say that the teachers couldn't be better but that it's a necessary step to get help from peers on this stuff.\n\n&gt; just \"roll with the punches\" and continue to say how good of a school DigiPen is instead of actually raising awareness of these issues.\n\nI think some people click with a \"trial by fire\" learning style and thus consider their experience at DigiPen a success. They may have known the right people or met the right people to succeed through school whereas people who are less fortunate end up falling to the wayside or feeling that they are not learning what they should be. I learned quite a bit from my peers and helped teach a few myself. At the beginning of my time at DigiPen I joined a study group that I continued with all the way through the school. That study group allowed me to get onto my first game team along with many other opportunities. \n\n&gt; If the expectations for your finished games were much, much lower\n\nThe first few originally were. At least I remember tons of terrible games in my freshmen and sophomore years. Maybe the game teachers have escalated what they are wanting? I'm curious if it has anything to do with other gaming schools using game engines rather than rolling their own. The ramp up could be coming from external pressures. That's not something the students should take the brunt of but it seems that they might be to some extent. If my assumption is correct at least.\n\n&gt; I started to realize \"oh hey, they just want these games to be really good and flashy so they can put them on the monitors and tout them as the new Narbacular Drop or Tag or Perspective or whatever\"\n\nYeah, that's the wrong way to go about making a game. Especially for a student project. They should be telling you to pursue something that your entire team finds interest in and try to develop a game that everyone on your team wants to make. Once that is set you'll have a better chance at developing something that could potentially be put on a pedestal. \n\n&gt; If you're a BSGD graduate, I want to ask you something and I promise I don't mean to be sarcastic or rude at all: do you feel like your \"game design knowledge\" that you actually learned from GAT classes has helped you in any way professionally?\n\nNot to sidestep the question, but after 3 years of being out it's tough to differentiate what I learned in the industry and what I learned at school. I learned quite a bit at school, but I learned most of my design sense from the games I worked on in school rather than from any lecture I listened to. I did have a few interesting lectures though.\n\nHere are a few things that I'm pretty sure I learned in my later years at DigiPen. I'm sure I missed a few things but this is the gist.\n\nLater on(Junior year and up) I learned level design practices (how to pull players to certain locations, telling stories through environment and whatnot). Then there was more level design dealing with re-using assets (extremely important to do to decrease asset dependencies). Manipulating numbers to get what you want which relates to probability but is definitely a separate piece of knowledge. An example of manipulation would be getting some range of values to become another range so you can act on it in some way. There was also formula manipulation which is more of getting the right curve(or whatever function you're dealing with) you want (this does not relate to intensity curves but more towards like a level system or economy). Working in a professional engine (Unreal, CryEngine, Unity, etc.). When I went through the degree we were tasked with creating particular genres of games and we were allowed to use whatever engine we wanted to accomplish that(this happened in junior year and we had 3 weeks for each genre given). \n\nSo I feel like there might be some great knowledge hidden in the later years, but that could be very dependent on what teachers are still around since I left. All of the above things to some extent require a finesse that you simply have to get the hang of to do it right/quickly.\n\n&gt; think about how they're designed while I try them, DigiPen's GD program seemed largely unnecessary\n\nTo me the gold that comes out of the GD program are the game projects along with whatever game projects you do in the GAT classes. Whether those games are good or not really doesn't matter. Good games will definitely get you more job offers, but the experience of simply working on games speaks volumes to potential employers when they are comparing Graduate A who just has a CS degree versus Graduate B who has experience working on some form of games. I sat through the classes and learned what I needed to learn but I always put all of my focus into the game and GAT projects or anything that I felt would increase my skills as a designer.\n\nI'm confident in my skills as a designer and I believe I can attribute a lot of that to what I learned at DigiPen. Though I'm not saying that all of what I learned came from teachers. A lot of it came from the experience of working on game projects and with teams. \n\n&gt; That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me\n\nI get you there. I never had a teacher where they clearly just ripped info off a youtube video, but I guess that teacher was really jazzed about the video and felt that up and coming designers need to know about it. Not saying that was the correct choice, just that that was what he was thinking I would imagine.\n\nMost of my design courses felt more interactive. Some were lectures but a lot of it was analyzing the intro of a game or working out a damage formula or working on our projects.\n\n ",

That was the whole class. He played the demo game attached to \"The Art of Screen Shake\", and paraphrased the video. I paid a lot of money for that class period. Holcomb tells you to do the math, and I did. I could've watched that YouTube video and gained equally as much information as having him explain it to me, without paying the \"Early Access\" fee to be in the GD program at DigiPen. I say \"Early Access\" because if the RTIS program is a decent Steam game that takes some work to get the settings perfect but is otherwise pretty good, the GD programs are Early Access titles that crash every few minutes and get patched four times a year without anything seeming to really improve.\n\nImplying that DigiPen's curriculum is unilaterally world-class is a joke. There are very good teachers who teach at the school and there are many very good classes. Then there are entire degree programs that are neglected by all staff members entirely (BSCSGD).\n\nIt's extremely frustrating to see people in this thread and elsewhere respond to criticism of DigiPen with \"well, it worked for *me*, it's probably *you* who's the weak one.\" That's great, I'm really glad for you, but let's be honest, you were probably RTIS or BFA if you're saying something like that. Or you're a GD student who's deluded themselves into thinking that they're actually \"learning how to design things well\".",

It's high for a very damn good reason unlike the other degrees. Don't forget I have piss poor courses such as assembly where it's been a joke with the professor last year or the one that has been teaching for I believe like 5 years? I would actually like to learn assembly since I'm paying what like $800x3 credits? It's extremely irritating, even if it's an easy credit course. Graphics for the first year isn't really the graphics programming that 99% of what people expected and that's 100% not changing. I can keep going on, but on the flipside of things networking went from someone who loved to fail people to someone who loves to share his knowledge. Keep in mind you may able to force the change, talk to the professor if that fails then talk to the head if that also fails then file a complaint with our current accreditation. Enough reports they'll have to make a change. A handful then they'll consider it. They do take all complaints seriously.  \n\nI hate to say it, but if you chose to go into game design where the degree is relatively new.. I want to say it's your fault. Ultimately it's not, it's the accreditation that allowed it and Digipen not making it as good as it can be. Ben doesn't care about the BSGD, all he cares is about his idea degree. Which is a complete joke imo. Also in my personal opinion, if you're a BSGD you should have made the switch to BSCS/RTIS and taken 5 (4 with summer classes or taken gen ed at a community college beforehand) years to get a minor in game design. Get into a company, and slowly work your way around into game design in a couple years. Hate programming? Feel free, but then at that point why be in pseudo CS and GD degree?  \n\nLook, I'm not trying to say everything is full of rainbows here. It's definitely isn't at the same time it's also not garbage. There should be tags for what degree we are to prevent such miscommunication since every degree is different. ",

As a prospective student who has taught themselves a ton of programming stuff for years, and also has an interest in the design of games and what is fun, what isn't fun, what's good design, what's bad design, etc., the BSCSGD program sounds amazing. It sounded like a degree program that was tailored for me specifically.\n\nIt's kind of bullshit that you're saying \"why didn't you transfer degree programs when you realized nobody cares about BSCSGD\"? Because, I dunno, the school advertised the degree program and I paid them money for it, so is it really so crazy to suggest I get value from it?\n\nImagine going to CS classes and hearing the professors talk about \"hey remember that car project you did in asm\"... no, I don't, because I'm not RTIS. \"Hey, remember all that free time you have to work on your game's engine because you're RTIS\"... no, I don't, because I have all this GAT work to do. Then you go to GAT classes: \"Hey, so since the only thing you guys are doing for the next two weeks that takes any effort at all is this GAT project, put everything you got into it and be a tryhard and make the board game box nice and polish the hell out of your rules and playtest it a million times\", when you're just sitting there like \"I don't have time for this, these BAGDs don't have to deal with programming homework or engine development, so I get why they put so much effort into these projects, but *I* have shit to *do*, man.\" It's insane. The fact that BSCSGD is still a degree program is absolutely ridiculous, and should make you guys realize that DigiPen isn't this amazing success machine that totally works 100% of the time for everyone, and that maybe, just maybe, some of the people complaining about it anonymously online actually have good reasons for doing so. Just because things worked out well for you doesn't mean they worked out well for everyone else.\n\n&gt;It's definitely isn't at the same time it's also not garbage.\n\nThat's entirely subjective. For my time and money and effort, it ended up being pretty fuckin' garbage overall. That's not to say it was without merit, but seriously, attending DigiPen was largely a waste of my time, academically. I would've been way better off attending community college part-time, learning C/C++ for reals (which I didn't know before attending DigiPen), getting a degree while working a part-time job or something, and working on making my own games and stuff on the side, potentially with other like-minded individuals. The game design stuff was basically worthless in my opinion, and the high expectations for student games and the stress caused by trying to meet those expectations (along with team drama and so forth) was absolutely not worth it. You seem to have had a different experience; that's awesome! I just want to emphasize that not everyone has a good experience, and they're not necessarily always solely at fault because of it, and that you having a good experience doesn't mean everyone else will, too.",

I really dislike talking down towards other degrees, but it's the cold hard truth. You're either a designer, artist, or a programmer as far as I can tell the courses are designed for. Why is there an in between? Well gameplay is usually done through script so you're not recompiling nonstop and a designer can easily test something out, tweak their idea, etcetc. It's supposed to be the best of both worlds and if you take advantage of it you can get a job in either field. Keyword, take advantage. Most people don't and just ride the recommended sequence rather than trying to expand their knowledge.     \n\nDon't get me wrong my time is nowhere near sunshine and rainbows. All my team experiences weren't positive ones, I've been stressed out over \"am I graduating on time?\", \"oh fuck, I may fail a course!\", and so on. And yeah you could have easily learn C/C++ at a CC or even off the internet, along with game design off the internet. Was there ever a need to go to Digipen for the degrees they offer? Absolutely not. The benefit of attending college? It's the collection of people with (hopefully) the same goal and because of that if you ever had a problem you can easily just ask literally anyone in edison if you need help. If they don't know then they'll grab someone who does know which is something most people don't take advantage of. Because of you interacting with others you'll get a random stroke of luck where they didn't go after X and so they mention it to you, getting a job at Y and they put in a good word for you, and so on. You do not want to burn any bridges which is why this is a random reddit account so hopefully no one associates it to me from anything negative I've said.   \n\nAlso nobody really expects you to make a good game. I'm not sure why people keep thinking this. The time when people do expect you to make a good game? When it looks like a promising game, because it helps advertise for Digipen. It's why Rachael and Ben start playing favorites. Is it wrong? Absolutely from a student's perspective. It's unfortunate Chris left, but his sample engine is all you need to get started. Making your own physics? Such a bullshit rule unless you want to be a physics programmer after graduation.  ",

Maybe that wasn't your intention, but that's how it's coming off right now.\n\nAs for why I think it's cringy: it's mostly because the point of that board is for people to vent about the worse parts of DigiPen. It's kind of a personal thing. To link that to this (fairly impersonal) subreddit where more than half the people on it are potential students, looking for more info on the school (basically, the public), just seems disrespectful to the people who are using /DigiPen/ to vent.",

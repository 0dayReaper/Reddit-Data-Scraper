    "postText": "So I'm a 23 year old man who already has an associates in game design, but I wanted to get a bachelors.  I applied to the BA in Game Design and was accepted.    \nBut the morning I toured the school I was hit with my first ever anxiety attack.  It was nausea so extreme that I could barely function, and had to postpone the tour for later that day.  I have deferred my enrollment to Fall of 2020 and I am currently on medication and in therapy to manage my anxiety and depression, but I've had less severe anxiety just thinking about this.\n\nThe top 2 things that scare me\n\n1. The workload and stress.  I've heard the horror stories about how tough it is. I am the type of person who does need time to unwind and de-stress, especially now that I'm going to be managing my anxiety and depression too.  This may be my own anxious brain over thinking this.\n2. The cost.  The cost is a big source of anxiety too.  $100k is a lot to sink into something I don't know if I can even graduate.\n\nA lot of this is probably my over-anxious brain catastrophizing.  I am also thinking of switiching to the BFA in Art and Animation, because I enjoy both designing games and creating art equally.",

I've also dealt with anxiety and depression for many years, and I know if I tried attending DigiPen before I had them in control in a functioning way, it would be catastrophic. Failing at DigiPen can have huge mental and financial ramifications, so dont start your journey until you're confident you're setting yourself up for success. And remember it's never too late (: if you're anxious about age, I can confirm, theres many freshmen much older than you!!",

Just know this works differently for everyone (:\n\nIt's taken me about 5 years, from my worst point, to my most functional and thriving adult point. 5 years ago I was having debilitating physical panic attacks every day, now I just have a lower threshold for stress, and actively deal with depression in various  cycles. The thing that helped the most was having a job I enjoyed to focus on, which drove me and helped me really grow as a person!\n\nI'm a CS major, but I know the workload for artists, especially freshman year, is arguably more. I personally work a job 15 hours a week, and push myself to aim high as an A student, so 95% of my time is spent doing class material. This means I dont take the time to game during the week, and my free time is browsing reddit and taking small social breaks through the day - however, I still take Friday nights off to hang out with friends, and do still do social things! But, I did go into the school knowing I wouldn't be able to do my hobbies, like cosplay, except for during school holiday breaks. \n\nRemember this is just me though - I know lots of people who have a very different work balance from me, and are happy aiming for a passing C grade, and dont work jobs. Just know that the more productive you are, the more likely people will want to be on project teams with you, and then you'll have better connections and portfolios for being hired!",

Part of what prompted this post was a high stress and high anxiety situation that I\u2019m still coming down from.  \n\nI think what the healthy thing to do is check back in a few months after I\u2019ve worked at my mental health and time management.  I\u2019m hoping to be healthy enough to be in a different state of mind.",

But I want so badly to work in the industry, as it's my passion, and I can't see myself doing anything else. The only huge thing stopping me being my own fear.\nI'm 22 years old, so I'm very much almost in the same boat as you here.\nI just wanted to drop in and quickly say that you're not alone in this very difficult decision. And I hope you find yourself happy with whatever path you take! I wish you the best of luck.",

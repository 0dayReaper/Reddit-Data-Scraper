    "postText": "Hi, I am an 18-year-old teenager in Korea. I'm thinking of going to Digipen to study abroad in September, 2021. I participated in all the game development projects in Korea as a project and I got good grades among high school students. It was so much fun to make games by planning games while coordinating team members' opinions. This is my question.\n\n1. How about getting a job after graduating from BS In Game Design? I know Digipen is famous in games, but most of the famous people are programmers. I'm still not good at English and I'm thinking about giving up game designer and going into programming because if i can't get a job after graduation, i'll be in trouble. I'm worried that only programmers have high employment rates. Yes, i'm thinking between my love of game design and reality. \n\n2. Do you learn programming from your major in game design? Korean game designer are just document-making machines. I heard that game designer in the U.S. learn a little of programming, is that true? If this is true, I think there is one more reason to choose a planning major.\n\n3. Should we hire a foreign game designer from the company? I have lived in Korea for 18 years, so I can't speak English fluently. Even if I go to school for 4 years or more, I won't be better at English than locals. Is this gonna be a problem?\n\n4. What does the portfolio of game design take? Also, can I submit a portfolio when applying for a game programming major?\n\nI am just a young boy with many dreams, but I want to be a great person. I would appreciate your reply.",

            "comment": "Hi - I'm an alumnus from the degree you're talking about, working in industry now, so hopefully I can answer your questions. I will answer slightly out of order, though.\n\n&gt;Do you learn programming from your major in game design? Korean game designer are just document-making machines. I heard that game designer in the U.S. learn a little of programming, is that true? If this is true, I think there is one more reason to choose a planning major.\n\nThe current BSCSGD got pretty heavily reworked and turned from what was essentially a double-major in both CS and design into the current form, which is mainly engineering-focused, and only has some game design in it. If you take this degree, you absolutely must be prepared to be an engineer just as if you took a purely CS focused degree. The BAGD degree, which is the more design-focused degree, sounds closer to what you're describing - a major in game design, with some programming. You do learn a significant amount of programming as a BAGD. Not enough to really be hirable as an engineer, unless you go out of your way to take some of the harder CS classes, but enough to be quite good with scripts and more programming than in any other game design major I've seen anywhere else. The professional designers I work with all must be at least able to program at a basic level, but I can't speak for every company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;How about getting a job after graduating from BS In Game Design?

The change happened a few years ago, so the students on the new program have not graduated yet. Historically, most of the BSCSGD students have become engineers, but some have become designers. I think due to the shift more towards engineering, the new ones will struggle to find jobs as designers, but will find them as engineers easily. I have not seen any decent DP engineer struggle to find a job, but I have seen some excellent designers, even those in the more design focused BAGD degree have a hard time. I will say that DP has an impressive hiring rate for designers compared to the other game design colleges, but you're correct that it's still quite hard. It's like going to a good acting school or dancing school. The best colleges will get a lot of people to become professionals, but even then, how many people can be professional actors or dancers? It's difficult.\n\n&gt;Should we hire a foreign game designer from the company? I have lived in Korea for 18 years, so I can't speak English fluently. Even if I go to school for 4 years or more, I won't be better at English than locals. Is this gonna be a problem?\n\nIf you can't achieve fluency, it will count against you somewhat, more so as a designer than an engineer, given how much of design is communication. You write English well for not having lived in a primarily English-speaking county, though, and the foreign students I saw come who could write it well got quite fluent by the end of their degrees. 4 years of immersion is a lot! Bluntly, most Americans are not particularly well educated in English, even though it's our own language, so I wouldn't say it's impossible to be better than most locals, especially in writing. \n\n&gt;What does the portfolio of game design take? Also, can I submit a portfolio when applying for a game programming major?\n\nI'm not sure if they accept portfolios for the BSCSGD, so your best bet is to email admissions@digipen.edu and ask them directly. For BAGD, they're mostly looking to see if you can do good iterative design. Take something you've made, get feedback about it from other people, use that feedback to figure out what you can improve on it, identify how to make those improvements, make them, and then test your results by getting feedback again. This can be anything - certainly a game, of course, but it could also be a piece of music, writing, a recipe, etc.\n\n\nThe first step I would take is to figure out what degree you would want if you came to DigiPen, whether that's BSCSGD, BAGD, or maybe even this program: https://www.digipen.edu/about/digipen-and-keimyung-university. It's brand new so I have no idea if it is good, and it is purely engineering focused, so I'm not sure it's what you want, but I figure it is worth mentioning. I'm happy to answer more questions, and I'd also recommend you speak to a BAGD as well as someone on the current BSCSGD track.",

That school is about 10 minutes away from my house, but I don't think I'm going to consider it because there are so many rumors that it's not working properly. Can I ask you one last question? If you go to BSGD and learn programming, do you learn about languages like C or C#? Or are you learning about tools like Unity, Unreal Engine?",

                            "comment": "It shares the same CS core with the other CS degrees, like the RTIS, general CS, and ML degrees, so it is primarily C/C++ focused in terms of the CS classes. For the team game projects, at least when I took them, in year 2 you are forced to use C++ and build your own engine, then in years 3-4 you have choice of engine, so you can choose Unity, Unreal, etc. if you want more experience in those engines. For your projects in the digital design classes, if you go BSGD or BAGD you also have freedom of engine, although there Unity tends to be dominant due to the small scope of the games. Unfortunately, I don't really know much more of what those digital design classes are like currently, due to the rework.\n\nOne major criticism I had of the school was that while you can learn Unity or Unreal from those projects, there's not really any formal instruction or expertise on the engines. As nice as it is to be able to work in an Unreal project for class credit, you're mostly learning from the internet, self-guidance, or your peers - there's not lectures on Unreal or professors with a background programming in it. So, you can *learn* Unity, Unreal, etc at DigiPen, but you're only ever *taught* C/C++.",

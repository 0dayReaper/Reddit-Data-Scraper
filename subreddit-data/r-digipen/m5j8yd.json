    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m trying to get into the digipen college and I already finished my main essay. Right now I\u2019m working on the individual essays that you have to provide for the pieces of work that you created. One of the questions is very unclear for me. That is the applicants role. For all my the work I submitted, it was only me who worked on it and I did everything. I was wondering how I would write about this topic as I\u2019m quiet confused.",

Use it to highlight the way you think.\n\n\nP.S. You need to capitalize the P in DigiPen. The admissions officer is a guy who pays attention to detail. **I'm dead serious about this one**",

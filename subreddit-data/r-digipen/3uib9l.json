            "comment": "I'm not sure if they offer internships or not. If they do I don't know what departments they are in. Currently there is nothing on their job site that mentions internships sadly. https://www.nintendo.com/corp/jobs.jsp# \n\nI do know that it is highly dependent on what you want to do for Nintendo that will determine if you can get an internship. I seem to remember something about programming internships but never anything about art.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless something has changed in the last 4 years, the Nintendo department that is in America that makes games tends to be working on ports and hand-held titles. They are by no means working on one of their front-runner IPs like Mario or Zelda. I think their claim to fame so far is the march of the minis games (which is apart of Mario but not necessarily what you would think of when thinking of Mario).\n\nIf this does not deter you then I wish I was able to give you more information.\n\nOne last thing, again, as far as I know, it can be difficult to get into Nintendo proper (the one that works on the bigger titles) if you are not a native Japanese speaker. That may have changed since I last inquired about it though.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

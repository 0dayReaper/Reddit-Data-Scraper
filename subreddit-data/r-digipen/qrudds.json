Will I be completely surrounded by other teenage freshmen or will there be some other older students?\n\nWhat does student housing look like? I know that it's actual apartments, but is it a good value for the cost? \n\nAnd also I've heard about the intense workload, how would a part time job fit into that? Or would I just be completely swamped and not even be able to think about it?\n\nI dropped out of community college, I thought I could learn under covid rules but I couldn't, online classes felt optional and I didn't have the self discipline to pass them. Would that hurt my chances of getting in? \n\nThank yall so much I appreciate it",

            "comment": "Hello, I graduated in 2012 so my information may be different from more recent students.  \n\n\nBut when I attended we had a handful of people coming out of the military and a couple of other people who had been in the gaming industry but just wanted to shift career paths. So yes, there are older students but it is far outweighed by the younger crowd.  \n\n\nAs for student housing I have heard you can get cheaper options nearby. But you would need to compare their prices to other local prices to really confirm that. (I didn't live in student housing as it didn't exist at the time/was just getting started).  \n\n\nFor workload I would advise against a part time job but I will also say that there were a couple of students in my cohort who did have part time jobs. The key is to manage your time well. It's gonna be rough though.  \n\n\nRecent grades might hurt your chances but you'll never know until you apply.  \n\n\nOne thing to consider as well is that DigiPen is astronomically expensive. If you're not going to be pursuing a degree related to programming in some shape or form it may be tough to pay those things back. It's rough starting out with $100,000+ of debt.  \n\n\nTo be clear I don't personally regret my time at DigiPen and I'm thankful I went as I'm enjoying a great career in the game industry right now but was rough starting out even being in a programmer adjacent career (technical designer). I'm still in quite a bit of student loan debt too. Some of that is my mess ups after graduating but it was still a hefty chunk of change to leave school with.  \n\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions. Make absolutely certain you want to make games for a living. If not then DigiPen isn't where you should go.",

Do student loans even apply for housing?\n\nAnd I want to do the art and animation program, and I heard the job placement afterwards was high, but all the stats im finding is for everyone. Do you know how well the job placement for art is?",

                            "comment": "Yeah, if I remember correctly the way it worked for me is that you do your fafsa to see what kind of federal loans you can get and then from what you get out of that you can calculate how much more you need based on DigiPen's tuition.\n\nAnd yeah, once DigiPen's tuition is covered the rest of the money from the student loan goes to you and you can basically use it for whatever you want. At least when I went through DigiPen that's how it worked. I maxed federal loans, got private student loans and paid everything through private loans mostly.\n\nI want to say you can ask DigiPen what their placement rate is for the specific degree you're interested in. Best to ask them I think.\n\nI mean, to some extent, you only get what you put into a program and DigiPen is no different. If you put everything into learning all that you can at DigiPen and work your butt off I suspect you'll have minimal trouble finding work. You might apply to a ton of places but eventually someone is gonna like what you're doing and hire you.\n\nAnd lastly I just want to say that once all is said and done if you're planning to cover all of your school expenses through loans along with your housing you're probably looking at somewhere in the ballpark of having to pay back about $200,000.\n\nJust look up the average student loan interest rate and find a student loan payment calculator to see how much that is per month(your loan term will probably be like 20-25 years) and make sure entry level positions will be able to cover that payment along with all your other expenses you expect to have after college. Housing, groceries, car, entertainment, etc.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.  \n\n\nNOTE: forgot to mention this originally. I lived off campus and paid for everything through student loan funds. Food, rent, entertainment, all of it.",

I'm actually also applying for Digipen next fall as well, I came looking for more information to be prepared in case I actually do end up going! ^ ^ \n\nI can't answer most of these questions, since I'm wondering the same things, but I am currently 20 and by next Fall I'll be around 21. I also don't know how many teenagers are going to be attending, but I am not a teen so I guess that's something :P",

If you need to work part-time, another university is probably a better match.",

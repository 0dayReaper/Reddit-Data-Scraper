    "postText": "I have a BSEE and Math degree from a top 10 engineering school, and I somehow got a software engineering job at a nearby company (you can probably guess). I'm just starting, so I'm more focused on my career now rather than this fantasy of mine. I just don't hope for it to be for more than a few years until I realize what I want to do next, and for the moment it's stuck on working at ND. \n\nFrom a cost perspective, I save almost everything I make, so in a few years I could have enough saved up to fund this exorbitantly expensive program. Or it could be used for literally anything else (a house, wedding, go towards an early retirement). \n\nI can expect some of you to say to pursue learning in my off time, but I find it really hard to learn by doing tutorials haphazardly. Plus I don't know how I'd learn real hardcore graphics or game programming by myself without resources. I've always enjoyed the structure of school and a curriculum (I've said that if I could be a student forever, I would), and putting money down is a powerful motivator, kind of like paying for a gym when you know you can work out at home. I hope I can transfer in some credits with my degree and/or blast through the first few semesters and increase my course load to cut down on the time to completion. People might also think I can just switch jobs here to something more relevant, but I don't work in anything related, and it's difficult to switch to something graphics or math heavy. \n\nAnyways, just kind of brainstorming here and want to get some opinions.

Sure, I could have potentially learned everything on my own but I'm not that motivated.\n\nSo, if money ends up not being an issue, and it sounds like it won't be, I'd say go for it.\n\nBut, you could also consider state schools that offer similar programs to DigiPen's and potentially be able to transfer more credits into those programs and save some money. The state school will most likely be cheaper as well.\n\nOther programs:\nhttps://eae.utah.edu/about-us/\nhttp://games.usc.edu/main/degree-programs/\n\nThough one of the unique things about DigiPen is that you'll be writing your own game engine or rather be apart of making one for each game that you end up working on I'm not sure if you'll get that experience with the above two programs and building your own engine will obviously teach you a lot about game development.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

What are the similarities/overlaps, and what can't you get in one versus the other? If I was more mathematically and technically inclined, and would like to learn more about a game engine, would I prefer RTIS over GD? But what if I still wanted to learn about game design (level design, game AI, etc)? ",

(Being a programmer and the designer for the game they worked on).\n\nI think you have a bit of wiggle room to take some design classes as well if you were wanting to do so.",

            "comment": "Current BSCSDA Sophomore here.\n\nI agree with what Rainbow said - DigiPen is a fantastic place for a really rigid and structured learning environment that sounds like it will be of benefit to you.\n\nI also agree that you seem to be a better for for the RTIS degree, as it's much more mathematical and program-y then the BSGD degree. Since it seems youre interested in design, I would personally recommend majoring in RTIS and then doing a game design minor.\n\nIt's a lot of money, but its worth it if getting into games is what you want to do. Sure, it's 100% possible to get into games WITHOUT DigiPen - but I feel attending somewhere like Digi doesnt just get you into the Industry, it prepares you for it. Which are two completely different things.",

    "postText": "I've read a great many horror stories about the workload and the social ineptitude and the anxiety attacks this school causes, or students have as a result of the school, or whatever. At the same time, I LOVE programming, and I know that the DigiPen name carries a bit of weight in the game design industry. I've submitted an application (currently 'being evaluated'. Assuming the worst to avoid disappointment) but I'm having second thoughts. I want to know if my background (both academic and social) would make it look like I have half a chance to make it out alive.\n\nIn short, I've been coding since middle school, dabbling in C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic, and x86 assembly for both fun and schoolwork. I willingly take 2 math classes in a private high school.  I'm currently working on a proof of concept game with what I believe to be a unique control scheme. This much I think is a good sign. However:\n\nI'm very much an introverted, detached person. I'm not socially inept as much as I'm likely to just tell friendly strangers to bugger off (in more diplomatic words) for making unwanted conversation. I intentionally avoid making friends because it gets in the way of my work and alone time, although I'm perfectly willing to work in groups when necessary, such as needing diverse skill sets.\nI work well with others, but I play horribly with them.\n\n I understand that DigiPen tries to be a tight knit community but I don't think I could integrate with that. I can't balance friends and work, and so I err on the side of work. I clock in, and clock out, avoiding personal interaction for safety's sake. I know this question has been asked a million times, but I'm worried that I need to reevaluate the schools I've applied to, and maybe change my first choice school.\n\nTL;DR: Anxious loner that loves to code worried they might be making a poor decision.",

DigiPen for programmers isn't actually that hard, people are just unproductive all the time. You may have difficulties with game teams, as they tend to require a fairly high amount of continued socializing, but beyond that I don't you'll have any issues.",

            "comment": "As a former RTIS and current BSCS, I'd say that it isn't that hard to finish freshman year and the first half of sophomore year. However, after that the difficulty starts ramping up significantly. There are lots of introverted people at DigiPen, in fact, I'd say that extroverts are the exception rather than the rule, especially in the programming degrees.\n\nI'm an extrovert myself, and I can often tell that I annoy people with my extroversion when I'm around them for too long. It's just a fact of life that introverts get tired of extroverts after being around them for too long. As it is, I'd say you'll be in good company here, although if you're not willing to open up and network, getting a career AFTER DigiPen can be difficult.\n\nHalf of the reason why so many DigiPen alumni get hired is because they work on games here. The other half is the networking, attending the company days, participating in resume workshops, and building an impressive website. \n\nHowever, don't fear too much, if you're not good at networking in person, having a really good website with good blog posts/production postmortems/code samples and sending resumes out often can get you in there just as easily.",

That will be no issue.\n\nAs far as social, you can absolutely do fine while being very introverted as long as you can work on a team. You say you can, so that's good. Just be prepared for very long hours working with your team.\n\nWere I you, I would mostly consider one thing, which is that a massive amount of the value of this school is the contacts and networking. Even if you \"make it out alive\", (which is a lot easier with friends to help you with HW) you're paying DigiPen a ton of money of be here, and a big part of what makes this place cool is wasted if you don't get that network. Why pay extra for it if you're not going to use it much?\n\nIf you've got piles of cash to spend and money's not an object, don't worry. If the money at all matters to you, or you're not dead set on the games industry, I would probably suggest going to another college. (especially UW if you're in-state)",

I don't go to Digipen but I've applied recently, hoping on getting accepted and I'm absolutely enamored with the school! &lt;3\nIt's interesting you say that DIT is tight knit because all I've heard is that it's really introverted. Most engineering/programming schools aren't, so it should be something you can optionally not be a part of. But as someone who's just applied, I'm just going to say that first and foremost, it is a for profit school after all, so make sure you can afford it. Also, be sure that's the kind of courses you want to take. I've heard a lot that DIT credits don't transfer to other schools, which can be a problem if you're still unsure.",

            "comment": "It looks like you are set, but I'll add a bit more.\n\nI'd say that given your experience with programming and motivation to get into the industry that you don't necessarily need to go to DigiPen. I have known quite a few studios that have no idea about DigiPen. It's mainly studios in Seattle that are aware of the school(which there are quite a few).\n\nYou could get a cheaper and similar education if you were to go to University of Utah or other state schools. Some have similar programs to what DigiPen offers. The thing that you get from DigiPen, like others have said, is the network and a deeper understanding of architecting a game. Also, getting a degree at a state school can get you into more places and is more well recognized.\n\nOther schools typically don't have students building games from the ground up. DigiPen has you do that.\n\nThe questions you need to answer for yourself are:  \n  \n1) Are you willing to pay exorbitantly more to get the student network and the deeper understanding of game engine architecture? (The person sitting right next to me at work got out of University of Utah with 1/4th the debt I'm in)\n  \n2) Are you ok with learning things in a \"trial by fire\" way? (There are things that you simply have to figure out yourself when developing an architecture for a game)\n  \n3) Do you want to live, eat and breath video games for 4 years? Sure, there are other things to DigiPen, but for the most part you're going to be hearing people talking about video games all day long.\n\nThat's all I have for now.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions if you have any. I'm a BSGD alumnus.",

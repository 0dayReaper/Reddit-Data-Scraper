    "postText": "It has the program locally in Washington I'm most interested in - I want to make my own cartoon/movie one day- tuition is significantly lower than art schools in-state and the it seems more specialized than if I were to go to Uni.\nAlso; I want to minor in Physics.\nDo you know anyone in the program? Is it a scam? Is there good job placement? Is it worth the money, time, effort? Thank you for reading!",

            "comment": "The program is extremely good compared to other fine arts programs, especially in terms of job placement. If you look on the Digipen website, they have statistics on job placement and income there from previous graduated students. To achieve this result, the degree is very intensive and requires a lot of time and energy. A lot of students drop out. I would not recommend doing this unless you know for certain that it is what you want. \n\nAlso, you will not have any time to minor in physics. You should just go to a community school, do physics classes there, then go to Digipen if you're interested in that.",

The BFA program is intense, not a lot of schools push you this hard but its because they're teaching you real shit. The first animation teacher you get is Anthony DeFato, who worked at disney for years and has credits on at least 7 disney films. The school is also constantly working to make sure you get a job. Digipens animation and fine arts program  is no joke. Its hard work and very stressful but if you can handle that and work your butt off its one of the best. That being said, check out Calarts too. Digipen has a huge focus on games. Calarts is exclusively film.",

I do know that unless you plan on 5 years and summer classes just for the minor alone it won't be possible.\n\nIt's 18 physics credits for the minor (see: https://www.digipen.edu/minors/) and physics classes are difficult, as well as having math preqs that you may or may not have. This is on top of the fact that the degree is easily one of the most workload heavy ones at DigiPen and that is saying -a lot- ",

    "postText": "To make a long story short, I've been interested in getting my BFA for numerous years, but haven't had the ability to do so where I currently live. Let's just say it's very close to Washington and in a pretty farm-oriented state... so, as far as artistic and technological education options go, I'm pretty limited where I currently am. This has led me to the conclusion that I have to move out of state in order to get the education that I prefer. Online learning is an option, but I would rather have to pay back the same huge amount of debt, that I'm inevitably going to have no matter what, to an institution that I've been able to work with hands-on and in person. Attending a campus in person would also be the best choice for the networking benefit and personal experience gained from being involved in projects run by groups (instead of just individually created animations) and learning to work as a team in such a competitive marketplace as the animation/game design industry. Unforunately, as I've implied, there are no community colleges or universities in my entire state that offer a BFA in animation... trust me, it's pretty shocking to me too.\n\nSince it's no fun flipping through a wall of text, I'll separate all my questions into their own categories. I apologize for the huge amount of questions in advance. If you can only answer one or two of them, that'd be great. I'm just trying to find out as much as I can since I'm not familiar with how privately owned colleges run, especially ones as specialized as Digipen. Really, anything helps. Also, if any of my questions are answered elsewhere online (such as the Digipen website) or in another thread, then feel free to link them. :)\n\nAdmissions:\nI've gone over some posts to this sub-Reddit and have noticed that many of the people asking questions about Digipen are either fresh out of high school or are still attending high school. I have personally only received a GED and am older than 18. This leads me to my first question; will this affect admissions or perhaps be frowned upon, since it's not a high school diploma? I'm not even sure how GPA would be looked up through a GED. I've also noticed that a few of the posters have already started taking generals in community colleges and the like, or are planning to attend Digipen for their second degree. Is previous experience a requirement and does it really make all the difference in acceptance?\n\nTuition:\nI've heard of the high cost of tuition, not to mention all other fees included in the package. I would have to say that, of all concerns about attending, the money is really the biggest worry. I realize that you can get by with some of it through financial aid, but I am nervous that in using student loans, there might lie the possibility of running out of funding? I have heard that credits, once earned at this institution, cannot be transferred elsewhere. This is a pretty scary thought, considering I would not want to attend for a year or two and then halfway through, lose the ability to go to school, and waste all that time and energy. Unfortunately, I don't come from a well off family (no offense for those who do), which means that I would be relying mostly on student loans and financial aid to attend. I just don't want money to be the deciding factor of not getting into my ideal school. The biggest question here is just how plausible would it be to attend Digipen using this route? Are there any students who are currently in this same boat with good results or who know of people that have graduated doing so?\n\nAccreditation:\nI read a rumor somewhere online that Digipen was soon to lose its accreditation. I believe the post was from 2012, so I'm not quite sure if it has taken affect or if it was purely just hearsay. Have you heard anything on this? Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nPlace of Residence:\nSince I don't have relatives living in Washington, I'm not sure exactly how the living situation would work. I know that there are apartments near Digipen that the school works with, but I have heard that finding an apartment with other students separately would be a lot cheaper. Still, therein lies a bit of a setback. How do students pay for their living, either way? From what I've gathered, it's nearly impossible to even have a part time job with Digipen's workload. Apparently getting a job on campus is also hard to do, due to the amount of people with the same idea. Also, where do you get set up with other students to find a cheaper living space? I have this impression that a forum exists online or something, but have yet to find such a thing.\n\nChoices:\nGoing over everything mentioned, if you have another college that offers a competent BFA in animation course in mind that is also nearby, then please let me know. I'm open to suggestions, although I would really like to make attending Digipen a possibility in the future.\n\nThank you for reading over my questions. Hopefully everything was clear, but if you need clarification, let me know. Also, if you have anything else to add about the school or the area in and around Redmond, I'm all ears!",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the suggestions! I've been researching schools for nearly a year, so I've probably exhausted all possibilities of cheaper schools that offer an in-depth animation course. I was considering Academy of Art University and their online classes, but I haven't heard the greatest things about them and online would lack the personal learning that I'm hoping to get. I'm not kidding when I say that there are no closer schools, besides ones in California, which I would rather not relocate to... although, Gnomon is a school that has also caught my interest. Unfortunately, they seem like they're more geared towards supplemental education for those who are already in the industry. A lot of those types of workshops are. :\\",

            "comment": "BSGD Alumni here.\n\nOne key thing I would ask before worrying about anything else is ask yourself what you want to do in games? Do you want to work in games or the animated film industry?\n\nWhile both industries may have similarities there are quite a few differences as well. Many BFA students that I have interacted with when switching over to working with a game team have had a learning curve to deal with. Not to say that's a bad thing just pointing out that there are differences.\n\nSo I'll try to answer as much as I can here.\n\nAdmissions:\nI do not know about GEDs and how DigiPen perceives them, but what I do know is that the admissions office could clear this up very quickly if you call them up.\n\nExperience - You need none of it for DigiPen, but it can always help. On the BFA side I believe teachers are simply looking for potential in candidates. I assume that you have been drawing for at least a while to be interested in the BFA program?\n\nI had some college experience going into DigiPen, but I feel that my portofolio/essay writing was more of what they looked at.\n\nTution:\nI was fully on student loans, no financial aid(didn't qualify), and no job whatsoever. I'm about $100k+ in debt but the payments are manageable, just don't have any other debt on your plate and you should be fine. I was also getting private student loans as well not offered by the federal government to get by as that was a necessity since I was not working and wasn't getting much from federal loans.\n \nCredit transference is something I have no idea about, but admissions could find out by asking the registrar at DigiPen.\n\nAccreditation:\nNo idea, and a quick google search didn't mention anything about DigiPen losing it. All I found was this article on DigiPen's website:http://news.digipen.edu/academics/accsc-grants-digipen-renewal-of-accreditation/#.U_FdHvldUZw\n\nBut that's from 2011 so I would call them up and make sure things are still good. I imagine they are.\n\nPlace of Residence:\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/rldb/\n\nLooks like you need an account to search. Not sure how to get one, may have to be accepted into the program, but you can always ask DigiPen about this as well.\n\nI paid for my living expenses with private student loans. But, I do know of people who have successfully gotten all the way through DigiPen while also having a part-time job, so it is possible. The key thing is having awesome time management skills.\n\nChoices:\nYou could always focus on traditional art skills for the time being and go to a community college that offers classes that deal in that. Your first two years of DigiPen as a BFA student will be mainly focused on traditional art skills.\n\nHopefully I have given you some insight into the things you have asked.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions : )",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the detailed reply! It's definitely informative. I'll be getting a hold of their offices before even considering filling out an application/writing an essay/etc. I understand that it will be predominantly traditional art the first two years, which is a bit of a bonus, since they won't be concentrating only on how to teach someone to use software. Drawing shouldn't be an issue thankfully, but I do agree that it wouldn't hurt to brush up on some realism and anatomy.\n\nJust two more question, if you don't mind; Do you know what would be expected in the portfolio, such as preference on style of art? I understand that they may want to see a wide variety, but I also know that, in some cases, it would be better to just stick to your individual strengths. Also, what would the likeliness be of an internship while attending?",

                            "comment": "Awesome, you'll definitely be drawing a lot while you are there.\n\nArt Portfolio:\nFor the portfolio I know they seem to frown upon any sort of anime-based art work and I think it's simply because they are trying to teach you how to draw from reality rather than something that is fictional. Plus, they see a ton of it from what I hear.\n\nNot to say that you can't show it, but be sparing. From there I don't know what other qualities they don't like or like to see.\n\nInternship:\nIt's likely but it can be difficult only because many other people will be pursuing that internship. You just have to work your butt off and a company many notice that hard work. I think art-based internships happen less often than say a programming internship as well, but that's just me saying that. I don't know for sure. You'll probably have a better chance at one in your junior and senior years.\n\nHope this helps!",

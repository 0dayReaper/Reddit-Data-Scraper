    "postText": "I currently have a B.S. in Computer Science from a state school (graduated with a 3.5), but I know that I am no where near the skill to where I could get a job working on a game engine. I am currently 22 and working in web development, but I have come to realize that I don't want to compromise my dream anymore.\n\nFirst, is there a precedent for accepting students that already have an undergraduate degree? Will it be harder/easier for me to get accepted based on this? Is it likely that I will need to retake the SAT to apply or will they accept my old scores?\n\nSecondly, Digipen is crazy expensive and I've heard most people take out loans. Is it common for people to go into ~100k of debt? Is it even possible to pay it off and live a normal life at that point? An alternative would be to continue working for 2 more years while living frugally and start digipen at 24 and finish at 28, but I am worried that studios may look down on new grads at that age. Am I stupid to be worried that companies won't be interested in letting me do internships/work for them at 28?\n\nAny advice would be helpful. I am fully aware of the work load and am prepared to commit, but the logistical issues are holding me back.",

DirectX, OpenGL, understanding the asset pipeline, AI, etc. are some examples of what I mean. I can probably learn a good amount of this on my own, but Digipen seems like it provides a unique opportunity to actually work on a team dedicated and big enough to accomplish building games from scratch.\n\nThe actual video game part is not as important to me. Designing levels, win conditions, etc. are not that important to me. I don't  play a massive variety of video games (primarily interested in esports), but the technical challenges that arise from real time simulations are what really excite me. I have always been academically minded and my current development job is just not challenging enough for me to be happy despite the great salary.  I am hesitant to say that I am probably not as big of a gamer as many people at Digipen because of the fear that people will say the school isn't for me, but I am still very passionate about the idea of being able to work on the technical challenges presented by video games. I know there are other technically challenging fields like quantitative finance, AI, natural language processing, etc., but for some reason I know I want be able to do real time simulation.\n\nThe end goal is definitely to become an engine programmer at a triple A studio. I know a large salary isn't important enough to me to make that dream something I don't want to pursue.",

There is more than enough room at DigiPen for engine programmers who just want to delve into tech and not worry about gameplay at all, and in fact I went to school with many of such a person. If the intense cost isn't a detractor and you just want to be an engine dev no matter what, then go for it. ",

I'm reading Game Engine Architecture right now and working on making a C++/OpenGL rendering engine based on ThinMatrix's tutorials right now.\n\nI'm pretty strong on data structures/algorithms (at least from the perspective of the algorithms needed for a big 4 interview and their applications), but my knowledge of multi threading and OS fundamentals is a bit lacking. Maybe I think you guys know more than you do, but it seems like I am missing a lot of the knowledge you have (as evidenced by my lack of a clear picture of the components of a game engine and how they fit together). I think the most important thing though is kind of a foot in the door thing. Being able to actually get a group together for a full year and build everything from scratch. I think actually shipping a game where you wrote the renderer and were part of a team is a big portfolio boost compared to working solo on a rendering engine that doesn't have a game attached to it.",

How professional and respectful you are to Asuka (the asst. registrar) will determine how many of your credits transfer.  Oddly, you will need your SAT score, or at least I did in 2008.  There were a lot of weird edge cases with my application though, I might have been an outlier on this.\n\n2b.  Your 3.5 GPA is fine, acceptance shouldn't be a worry.\n\n2a.  The first student to hit $80k in loans was in '08, I confirmed a $100k debt in '11, and there is an unconfirmed $125k debt from a 2015 grad. \n\n2b.  Age was never an issue in my applications and interviews with studios/companies, but my *status* as a \"new college grad\" held a weird sway.  It was partly cultural and partly bureaucratic, e.g. there was a veteran's hiring initiative in early 2012 and one company recruiter told me that she couldn't put me in her system as both a vet and grad.

One example: I ended up being at DP for 5 years but they had my original projected grad date on record.  During the second semester of that 5th year MS reached out to me about a sweet job.  While scheduling the interview I let them know that technically I'd still be a student at DP but they'd happily let me work my final projects class, I'd just need my new boss to sign a paper in April saying that that I had indeed been going to work and doing computery stuff.  \n\nThe recruiter was quiet, then came back with something to the tune of \"we can't hire for this position without a degree first.\"  I told them that's cool, I already have one, DP is my second.  The recruiter then said something like \"'Careers' has you down for Digipen and I can't change it\".  I recognized that I was getting impatient and angry (Asshat, *you* called *me*) so I didn't press the point further and got off the phone.",

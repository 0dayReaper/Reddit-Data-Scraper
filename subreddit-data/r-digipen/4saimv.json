    "postText": "Hello there, I've applied to Digipen as a BAGD student, but have since been seeing loads of online posts about BSGD being a more well rounded program. My goal would to one day be able to lead and understand what everyone is working on in a project, so it makes sense to dig deeper into programming than simply basic scripting. Though I haven't done much programming before, from the little I have, it's been quite fun. The math is a bit worrisome simply because I didn't enjoy most of my classes despite being somewhat decent. Anyways, I wanted all of your advice.",

In general I'd say that BSGD allows you to better understand what everyone else is doing in development.\n\nMath is a huge part in game development as well and it's typically not full-on academic math. It's usually you having to manipulate numbers to get the desired outcome you want, at least when you're designing stuff.\n\nI work with a BAGD who focused a lot on programming and got the same job as I have, so it's definitely not impossible to get similar jobs as the BSGD grads if you go with BAGD.\n\nAnd just like what the others have said, the physics class is more focused on describing a situation and figuring out the math behind it. That's how mine went anyway.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

(I have VERY little, studied C++ for one semester years ago)\nAlso, I'm HUGE into animation, and would love a chance to delve into 3D character animation. Is that at all possible in BSGD, or only BAGD?\nHow hard is it to switch between the various degrees? (I've read the process, but I was wondering if you had any idea from student perspective)\n\nThanks for helping me out :)",

I took summer classes just about every year while attending which helped out immensely when going into the next year.\n\nI was also able to take a few classes at the local community college which reduced my student loans ever so slightly.\n\nHmmm, not sure, probably miss out on stuff dealing with art or writing. \n\nFor programming experience, at least in the BSGD program, and I assume the BAGD program, they go with you knowing absolutely nothing.\n\nAnimation for BSGD is probably a no go, but might be possible given what other people have said here.\n\nThe difficulty of degree switching depends on which degree you started with and is a gradient from programming to art (I don't know how the music degrees fit into this so forgive me for not adding them).\n\nCE, RTIS, BSGD, BAGD, BFA\n\nIt's easy to jump from BSGD to BAGD, or BAGD to BFA, but it would be fairly difficult to jump for BAGD to RTIS lets say.\n\nAlso, definitely consider other schools. Some are cheaper, offer the same opportunities, are higher rated than DigiPen for design degrees, and on top of that are better accredited. Utah state, and UC Santa Cruz are higher rated(princeton review), and potentially cheaper. They also offer a more well-rounded college experience.\n\nDigiPen definitely offers a unique game development-centric environment but it's also not the typical college experience.\n\nTo some extent, life outside of DigiPen stops and then picks up after you get out. It's not absolutely that way, but it can get in the way of having a social life outside of DigiPen.\n\nHopefully that helps, and I have no idea what the CP average is as I have been living in California for a year or 2 now, haha\n\nI'd imagine they are insanely high in the Redmond area (where DigiPen is located)\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

Some of those classes are absolutely killer, and they'll be hard to take while doing GAT classes, which are killer for the GD students.\n\nIf all you want to do is eventually become a producer, quite a few come out of the RTIS program just fine.",

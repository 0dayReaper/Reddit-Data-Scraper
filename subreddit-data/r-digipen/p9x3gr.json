    "postText": "hello! i'm an incoming freshman and i was wondering what kind of homework to expect from the classes associated with a BFA, like an estimate of how many hours per week, what kinds of assignments, and what the experience was like/how people generally felt about doing them?\n\nas a fresh high school graduate, i've never taken legitimate art classes before that weren't just mandatory high school electives and i'm sure they vastly differ in intensity than classes at digipen, so please feel free to imagine that you're explaining this to someone with no prior notable experience :')\n\ni've tried searching for existing answers to this but all i find is on the homework from the computer programming side of digipen (good luck to everyone on that side btw!!) but some information on the BFA would be super appreciated &lt;3 thank you!",

            "comment": "Hello, my info is likely out of date but I'd imagine it is probably pretty close to what you'll run into.  \n\n\nI graduated from the BSCSGD program but since I was in the second cohort of that program to graduate I had to take art 101.  \n\n\nArt 101 is just pure drawing of stuff. Usually we drew a still life of some sort and used various kinds of tools to do so (pastels, charchoal, pencil, etc.).  \n\n\nWe were typically given homework like draw 100 of blah 4 drawings per page. Sometimes we were given more instruction like do 20 5 minute drawings, 20 10 minutes ones, 20 20 minute ones, etc.  \n\n\nBack when I attended (started in 2008) I did hear a lot about art students staying up late to get stuff done so I'm pretty sure you're gonna have quite a bit of homework. Now, to be clear, I don't know how effective the art student's time management skills were at the time so it's always possible that you can get stuff done without staying up super late.  \n\n\nFor art 101 specifically I did pull a few all nighters to get those 100 drawings done but that's just how I worked sometimes.  \n\n\nAlso, somewhere in the DigiPen catalogue there should be an estimate of homework hours versus credit hours and I'd personally assume the higher end of that time amount.  \n\n\nHope this helps!",

I've not taken any art classes myself, but hopefully the artstations of a couple of my BFA friends here might help give some idea as to what the assignments are like:\n\n[https://www.artstation.com/teheehee](https://www.artstation.com/teheehee)\n\n[https://www.artstation.com/lushiette](https://www.artstation.com/lushiette)\n\n[https://ruiq.artstation.com/](https://ruiq.artstation.com/)\n\nThey're seniors as well - and I'm sure they'll be more than happy if you were to message them (on the right platforms) and ask them about the workload.\n\nAlso, the upcoming Day Zero is a great opportunity to ask BFA seniors directly!",

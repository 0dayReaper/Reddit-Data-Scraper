            "comment": "The most correct answer would be, it depends. The first thing to note, is that other than artist computers, until you're a sophomore, you're not assigned a teamspace. And non-teamspace computers tend to be older than teamspace ones.\n\nBut as an example, I'm have an older machine in R&amp;D (I'm an intern.) that was taken from the normal student lot, and for the most part, it's not bad. Any slowness is simply because of the software installed/what I'm doing. It's an i5 with a GTX 660. The Tesla computers are better than that, i7s with 760s I believe.\n\nThe biggest issue with computers is not being able to configure them yourself. They come preconfigured and if you need admin rights for anything you'll have to go through IT.\n\nIn general I've had good experiences with the school machines, but I've seen problems with them. Almost never is this hardware related. I'm currently about to be a junior.",

I've been running with fewer tabs lately. Memory leaks when you're running a machine for weeks at a time are no good. ",

Nitronic Rush ran fine on the school computers whenever we did playtests. Nitronic being a junior team game and being fairly graphics intensive.\n\nDon't know if they have been updated since I attended though. (2008-2012)\n\nEDIT: Grammar correction",

I had just come off of working on an amazing game with an amazing team and when I would show Nitronic to potential employers they would just say \"that's great, but it's not what we do\".\n\nI was, to some extent, stone-walled by HR people. I'm certain there are HR people out there who have an understanding of what skills are needed to do the jobs that they are hiring people for but it sometimes feels like HR are just looking for a bullet list of items and if you're missing one of those items you go into the \"do not hire\" pile. Of course they have a lot of people to flip through so it makes sense, but it's still a painful thing.\n\nAnyway, I started off at Gas Powered which had a tailspin and essentially laid off their entire staff until they were bought up by Wargaming.\n\nWhile at Gas Powered I worked on Project Spark since Microsoft contracted out to us for that game. When that contract ended, my employment also did. From there I went on to be an AI tester at Bungie and was in charge of testing the Fallen and Cabal enemies in Destiny.\n\nI then left Bungie for a design job at Zombie studios where I worked on Daylight which was a randomly generated horror game. It had a rough development life cycle and didn't turn out too well. When that game shipped most of the people that were working on it were laid off. Zombie would later close its doors and turn into a new studio.\n\nFrom Zombie I was hired on at Z2 which is a mobile games company where I worked on Battlenations.\n\nIn the interim between Zombie Studios and Z2 I applied to many other companies. One of them being Rockstar.\n\nWhile I was working at Z2 I was offered a position at Rockstar. I took it and now I'm working at rockstar as a technical designer.\n\nI'm hoping that I stay at Rockstar for a while. Having a steady job would be nice for my financials, haha\n\nI realize that this post is super long, but I suppose I felt that I should explain everything that happened to me after graduation.\n\nWhat I will say is that I know others that have worked at the same job since they have graduated, so my story is not something that happens to everybody.\n\nI'm in a great position now though, and if I were to ever leave Rockstar I'm confident that I could get into another AAA studio.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions if you'd like.",

DigiPen pretty much forces you to do that by throwing you into the deep end of things. You just have to figure out some stuff on your own. I don't know how intentional that is on DigiPen's part, but it's there.\n\nAnother thing that helped a bit was working with teams of people on games. Sort of a simulation of how it is in the real world, except you have a safety net, to some extent, since you're attending a school.\n\nIf you stay through DigiPen you'll go through those two things naturally.\n\nDefinitely keep in mind that DigiPen is super expensive and even now my student loans are tough manage(I can pay them, they're just damn expensive). I couldn't imagine having anymore debt than what I have now (~100k). Attending DigiPen now costs over 1.5 times more than when I went.\n\nIt can be tough to get on your feet as well. Even I said there are people how have had their job since they graduated, others are jumping from job to job and some just never made it into the industry.\n\nIf you do truly decide to go to DigiPen, work your butt off so you have better prospects when you get out and network with as many of your peers as you can. Jobs in this industry are quite often obtained through the people you know.\n\nThough I will say that the Rockstar gig I have now was due to a resume sent to their job site. First time I've been hired into a dev position that way though.",

    "postText": "(Okay, I was redirected here from /r/gamedev... so... I'm sorry for copypasting this.) \n\nHi. I'm a 20-year-old not-really-a-student-anymore Singaporean guy who's currently enlisted in the army via conscription. Whilst serving my term here, I've been looking for unis to go to, and over time, I've decided that I would want to get myself involved in the gaming industry via Game Design. The Computer Science-y section, because my artistic skill is close to nil. \n\nI only had a brief idea of this last year, when I first enlisted. Before enlistment, I'd already secured a place in the National University of Singapore, scoring a spot for a double degree in both Business Admin and Comp Science. But after a year of consideration, I'm now torn between NUS and DigiPen. \n\nSo right now, I must ask you guys for help. Could anyone clue me in on the current reputation of DigiPen? If possible, how does the course compare to NUS? \n\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention... I have absolutely no prior experience in this field; I'm going in completely blind. ",

Are you interested in the computer science/design aspect, or do you just want that game you've had a vague idea for to suddenly exist?\n\nA common thing Claude says is that while normal colleges give you two years or so to figure out what major you want before doing two years specific to that field, DigiPen gives you two years of degree specific classes, and then two years of \"work experience\". Like I said, I'm not sure how colleges in Singapore work, but DigiPen requires a certain amount of dedication.\n\nIf you know what goes into making a game, I recommend checking out the RTIS program over BSGD. After a year, if you find out you really want to do more design work, switching to BSGD is pretty easy (most of the credits are the same).",

Just be sure to talk to the upperclassmen and watch what they do, ask questions, and learn from their mistakes.\n\nAt the end of freshman year, if you spend a lot of free time doing out-of-class research, extra work on your game project, and you're still hyped about spending a year on a game project then keep going. If not, you should probably reconsider.\n\nI guess I'm just really trying to emphasize the self-motivation aspect of the program. Nobody will pull you through it, and if you're content with just going to classes and leaving to do the minimum for your homework it probably won't work out for you. On the flip side, if you're dedicated and genuinely interested in the subject, and are willing to put in the extra time, it's a great program.",

    "postText": "As per the title, I've recently been informed that I was accepted into the BAGD programme. I'm now however, stressing over whether or not to accept the offer and was hoping to have some of my doubts clarified. I did do some research over the internet myself, but I figured it will be more beneficial to hear the thoughts of alumni and current students. Some of them pertain specifically to the life I can expect during and after the programme in Singapore so I am hoping the alumni and current students of the Singapore campus can answer them. For the other more general questions, if the alumni and current students from the Redmond and Bilbao campuses have any insights, I will be glad to hear them as well!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) Is it true that the course is generally considered the worst because it is \"where people who're not good enough to be artists and programmers go\"? I'm paraphrasing what I've heard from a few BAGD alumni, but in general they all said the same thing.\n\n2) I have both programming (C++ and Java) and art (graduated from an art school in Japan, also doing freelancing and commission work) backgrounds, how well will I be able to fit into the BAGD programme?\n\n3) How well (or how little) does the programme prepare you for the industry?\n\n4) Will there be any internship opportunities during the course of study?\n\n5) Can I expect to find a job in the video gaming industry in Singapore after graduation? I asked around in that same group of Digipen alumni and one of them said only 30% of graduates manages to find a job in the video gaming industry. How accurate is that number?\n\n5a) In the event that I fail to secure a job in Singapore (because lets face it, the industry here is niche at best), how do my job prospects look overseas? Are there enough companies who're willing to hire entry/junior game designers?\n\n6) Is getting a part-time job feasible during my course of study?\n\n7) Any other things that I need to know or take note of for the BAGD programme?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAny and all insights or answers to my questions are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.",

I'm paraphrasing what I've heard from a few BAGD alumni, but in general they all said the same thing.\n\nno lol, that's completely ridiculous. It's for people who love design\n\n&gt; 2) I have both programming (C++ and Java) and art (graduated from an art school in Japan, also doing freelancing and commission work) backgrounds, how well will I be able to fit into the BAGD programme?\n\nAny programming will help you with scripting as a bagd, art will be helpful in solo projects as well\n\n&gt; 3) How well (or how little) does the programme prepare you for the industry?\n\nIt preps you for being a designer, but it's still very hard to get a entry level design job, period.\nI personally haven't had trouble getting to work on awesome games, but some people aren't so lucky, or aren't as good at applying/interviewing.\n\n&gt; 4) Will there be any internship opportunities during the course of study?\n\nYes but they are hard to get, like entry level jobs. I was lucky enough to intern at Blizzard, but only after my 4th (of 5) years.\n \n&gt; 5) Can I expect to find a job in the video gaming industry in Singapore after graduation? I asked around in that same group of Digipen alumni and one of them said only 30% of graduates manages to find a job in the video gaming industry. How accurate is that number?\n\nThere are stats on this, you don't need to rely on hearsay.\nhttps://www.digipen.edu//sites/default/files/public/docs/disclosures/BAGD/30.3101-Gedt.html\n\n&gt; 5a) In the event that I fail to secure a job in Singapore (because lets face it, the industry here is niche at best), how do my job prospects look overseas? Are there enough companies who're willing to hire entry/junior game designers?\n\nGetting a green card or other visa support or whatever to america for entry level work is TBH extremely unlikely/difficult. Once you have lots of experience it's a lot more reasonable.\n\n&gt; 6) Is getting a part-time job feasible during my course of study?\n\nYes, but wouldn't recommend.",

            "comment": "US BSGD alum here, from back when we took almost all the BAGD classes.\n\n&gt; 1) Is it true that the course is generally considered the worst because it is \"where people who're not good enough to be artists and programmers go\"? I'm paraphrasing what I've heard from a few BAGD alumni, but in general they all said the same thing.\n\nThat is something of a stigma, yes. Pretend, for a second, that you are an idiot, but desperately want to go to Game School(tm) because making video games must be the BEST THING EVER. Math and CS are hard, art takes a lot of time and dedication, so the CS degrees and BFA are out. But, for BAGD, how hard could designing games and being an Idea Guy(tm) possibly be?...   \nThat doesn't mean there aren't great designers, or that the program isn't actually difficult, of course. It's just that to the kind of person who shouldn't be at DigiPen at all, BAGD *seems* way easier than the other degrees, so gets chosen. \n\n&gt;2) I have both programming (C++ and Java) and art (graduated from an art school in Japan, also doing freelancing and commission work) backgrounds, how well will I be able to fit into the BAGD programme?\n\nCan't speak to the SG culture, but stateside that would be considered normal, although more experienced.\n\n\n&gt;3) How well (or how little) does the programme prepare you for the industry?\n\nPretty well, assuming you take to it. The design work is bullshittable in a way some of the other degree's stuff isn't, so you can get through it without a lot of learning if you try, but if you're looking to apply yourself and learn, it's not an issue. BAGD doesn't teach nearly enough technical skills, which is the one big knowledge gap, but the design it teaches is solid.\n\n\n&gt;4) Will there be any internship opportunities during the course of study?\n\nMight be harder for you if you don't have dual-US citizenship to access the market here, but stateside, yeah, that happens. Not to the majority of students, but some of the top students get them. Can't speak to SG specifically, of course.\n\n\n&gt;5) Can I expect to find a job in the video gaming industry in Singapore after graduation? I asked around in that same group of Digipen alumni and one of them said only 30% of graduates manages to find a job in the video gaming industry. How accurate is that number?\n\nThat's a bit lower than it is here, but I would ballpark it at around 50/50 for us in the US, so that is probably near accurate for SG. DigiPen has a high success rate relative to other design programs, but it's an insanely crowded field. (think dance, music performance, etc.) You can be a brilliant pianist and not get a job b/c there's just not that many pianos that need playing, and it's similar with design.\n\n\n&gt;5a) In the event that I fail to secure a job in Singapore (because lets face it, the industry here is niche at best), how do my job prospects look overseas? Are there enough companies who're willing to hire entry/junior game designers?\n\nEnough, no, definitely not. Some, yes. Your odds are better if you hold dual EU or US-citizenship, but even then it's dicey. The job market for this is saturated, and looks to be getting worse with how many schools are jumping on the bandwagon.\n\n\n&gt;6) Is getting a part-time job feasible during my course of study?\n\nNot very, if you want a life. Some students who are super fast can pull it off, but I don't see many even doing 10 hrs/week, and more than that is even rarer. DigiPen is already a timesink, so I don't think it's healthy regardless.\n\n\n&gt;7) Any other things that I need to know or take note of for the BAGD programme?\n\nI'd advise against it, generally speaking. If you are absolutely, 100% committed to being a designer specifically, have someone else paying for your schooling/as a safety net if you can't find a job, then maybe. If you think you might want to go do something else, or you're concerned about finances/employability, I would not become a BAGD. DigiPen has a high success rate relative to other design programs, but there's too many people who don't succeed, and end up financially fucked for me to really recommend it. If you're going to bet on your future, make it a safer one.",

            "comment": "current student in sg campus (but not from bagd)\n\n1. they\u2019ve said it as a joke don\u2019t take it too seriously. in game projects the average bagd is too unskilled to code the engine in C++ (though bagds can script in C#) and too unskilled in doing the art assets so they just end up doing designing work. in a group project, you would want more programmers and artists. \n\ndesign is a totally separate discipline and yes they do prepare and teach you for it. ultimately the whole game, code and art, is dependent on your vision. a good designer would be able to plan out a game that\u2019s easy to make and enjoyable to play. \n\n2. well if you have code and art background you\u2019ll be extremely valuable in groups! you\u2019ll have to take some computer science and art modules but it\u2019s different from the BFA and rtis and bsgd courses, they\u2019re easier thus the weaker coding and art skills among bagds. \n\n3. i would say very well, it\u2019s digipen bruh. since you\u2019re in the singapore campus all unis here participate in the Graduate Employment Survey and if u google the results for the past years you can see that your course has a full time employment rate of 90 to 100%. that\u2019s higher than the BFAs, but lower than BSGDs and RTISs\n\n4. yes, many companies to choose from. all you could even source yourself. \n\n5a). 30% is accurate. by the time you finish digipen most people will end up to be like \u201cfk this i don\u2019t wanna make games anymore let me do UX/UI in banks lol\u201d\n\n5b). you\u2019ll definitely find a job as a designer. as a GAME designer however, maybe. \n\n6. no because to even complete your course in four years, you\u2019ll have to take courses during the summer semester. failing courses is also common so you\u2019ll need extra time to retake them.",

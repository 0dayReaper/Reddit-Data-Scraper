    "postText": "Hiya all \n\nDone my research, and decided I am pretty determined to get into this MFA program. I was an art and psych student in college (graduated 2017) and chose psych. Decided it isn\u2019t for me, and really would like to get back to art and start an upheaval of my career path. Mostly looking to work in graphic design for big gaming companies. \n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I produced any major projects, and I need to start on a portfolio from scratch. Very daunting thought for me. Any pro tips or general advice (ie. is this is right program)??? THANKS in advance",

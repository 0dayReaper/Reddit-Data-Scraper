    "postText": "Hey y'all, I'm working on adding a student game spotlight series to my Twitch channel! The spotlight will consist of a playthrough of one or more projects with commentary from myself and the student, followed by a short interview about the design process and life as a game design student. Most of the initial guest students will be friends of mine in the design program at Digipen, but I hope to bring on other disciplines and maybe even students from other institutions over time if the series gains traction.\n\nI would love to contribute towards more education on the development, design, and production processes and to give students a platform to share their work.\n\nMy channel is not particularly big right now so any support is appreciated! The first stream is scheduled for tomorrow (March 5th 2021) at 2:30pm at [twitch.tv/gppskinny](https://twitch.tv/gppskinny).",

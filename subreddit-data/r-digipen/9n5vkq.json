    "postText": "I am a junior in high school with a 3.6 gpa. My dream is to go to digipen and become a video game artist or animator. I am also enrolled in my local community college and will graduate with an associate\u2019s degree. I have really started grinding on my art for when applications come around. Any tips on what I should have in my portfolio and what I should be doing to help myself to get in?",

Working in perspective and creating depth on your paper is also important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you a technically minded person? If I could go back and do it again, I'd learn Python before I went to Digipen. Artists who can code are VERY in demand and if you're a technical kind of person, technical art is a really great career path. ",

Do you mind telling me what kinds of things you put in your portfolio to get accepted? I\u2019m extremely anxious because I\u2019ve wanted to go to this school since I was little and I REALLY don\u2019t want to get rejected",

Attend figure drawing sessions in your area, draw bowls of fruit, whatever - as long as you are taking your reference from life. Your actual skill at drawing isn't a make or break - it's showing you draw reference from life and have a desire to improve that are more important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince you have some time left before you graduate, I'd recommend digipen's pre-college program as well. There's also some online/weekend courses that projectfun (the digipen k-12 department) puts on throughout the year as well.",

First year is a lot of refining traditional drawing and painting skills. There's a class both semesters Freshman year where you do more drafting kind of drawing then just fun stuff from your head or drawing people.    \n\n\nThis is the portfolio I applied with 4 years ago: \n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/kingdom-of-milk/gallery/65975802/DigiPen-Application-Submissions](https://www.deviantart.com/kingdom-of-milk/gallery/65975802/DigiPen-Application-Submissions)",

I found a website last year that had tutorials and code snippets to help with making games, but I've been searching the internet for hours today and I can't find it or anything like it. Does anyone have any documentation for it?",

Though, at that time, it was using python and not Zilch.\n\nBUT, I have heard Zilch is quite similar to python. Zero felt a lot like Unity in some respects. I appreciated the event system that Zero had built-in along with the layering system it had for the screen and script.\n\nIf the projectFUN engine hasn't changed much I'd say you're moving on to something significantly better once you get the hang of it.\n\nGood luck with learning the new system!

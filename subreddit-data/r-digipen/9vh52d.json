Only the first year is traditional media.\nRegarding the application, I only submitted 3D assets for my submission portfolio, except for the required drawings, and I got in so u should be good. Do note that due to increasing student numbers/applicants, there may be changes in the application/portfolio process to make it more competitive. ",

    "postText": "So this is tricky... I long thought that the BAGD was the program I wanted. But I watched a video today at the Digipen site comparing it to their Bachelor of Fine Arts program, and it seems as though the BAGD students are not designing levels or worlds, but rather populating these. The one who designs the levels and worlds is an Environmental Artist. The one who designs the UI is the UI Artist. \n\nThese are the things that interest me, not animation, not programming. I want to design games, design the game interface, build levels and worlds, model items for the world, etc. I would rather leave the animation and programming to someone else. \n\nConsidering this, what degree is the best fit for me at Digipen?\n\nThanks!",

It's probably better to pick one and have the other as a thing you develop on the side.. Like as an environment/prop designer, I work a lot with our game designers and knowing how to do art well can really influence their designs. So for example if I though our game was kind of boring with just platforming, I could draw some cool enemys and 8/10 times we could incorporate them into the game in a cool way. \\(unless it would make the game overscoped\\) \n\nBoth the Game design and Art Programs are A LOT of work! So picking either one, you better be ready for alot of sleepless nights and an up hill battle\n\nGood luck though :\\) I've made it into year 3 here",

            "comment": "It wouldn't be a bad idea to focus on level art composition, which is heavily related to level design. You aren't necessarily making 3D models but you are placing models into the scene, perhaps doing lighting and stuff like that to visually compose a level. \n\nIf you want to do virutally anything specific like that, you kind of do it yourself. For this example you would probably want to take the BAGD course and join projects that let you do level design and composition, and specifically tell your team that that's what you want to do and it can be designed into the game. You can take art and environment art classes as well to get a minor in art, I believe.",

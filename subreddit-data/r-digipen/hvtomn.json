            "comment": "Hello, if you want hard numbers for this it would be best to contact DigiPen Administration. They should have graduation rates for each degree program.\n\nI graduated from the BSGD program back in 2012. \n\nAs far as getting a job in the industry to some extent it depends on what job you're seeking.\n\nThere are less design jobs than programming jobs which inherently makes them more difficult to obtain. Coming right out of school makes it more difficult as well for design jobs. But I have seen tons of people do it.\n\nThe games you make at DigiPen will have an important role in job placement as well. It really depends on who sees the game though.\n\nThis may not be true anymore but when I was showing our team's game around to employers/recruiters they would more often than not say \"yeah, that's cool, but that's not what we make\" so they didn't really notice the skill in making the game and instead just focused on the type of game I helped make.\n\nAs for developing an indie game on the side that is definitely doable it will depend on your companies policies when it comes to making stuff outside of work.\n\nThe company I work at for example just says I can't use equipment(among other things) that the company owns to make my own game. Makes sense right?\n\nHope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions.",

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to be applying to university nearing the end of this school year (11th grade), and as someone who's always loved games, and spent the last 2 years programming and designing my own games, i'm quite certain that i want to have a career in game development, or at the very least CS. Digipen was one of the top schools i found for this sort of thing. From the website to the stories and the great write-up on this subreddit by u/Allen_Chou , it looks like an excellent university and a place i'd love to attend. However, during a conversation with some friends on the topic, some weaknesses/concerns arose, and i was wondering if you guys would be able to answer them, whether you're currently attending or an alumni. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, the 18% 4 year graduation rate, and 52% 6 year graduation. That's incredibly low, considering universities like MIT often have 6 year grad rates in the 90's. This is either due to bad teachers, or the school letting people who are not nearly as talented/capable as the curriculum requires (53% acceptance rate vs \\~10% of MIT, etc.). Can any of you comment on this?\n\nSecondly, the Wikipedia article for DigiPen lists ' DigiPen has been criticized for asserting ownership over the copyright of work performed by their students. ' as one of the criticisms of the school. The article linked as a source dates back to 2008, but i was wondering if anybody currently attending would be able to share their experiences with this.\n\nFinally, i was wondering what your grades/scores were when applying, and if you got in. I've only done the PSAT, but my score for it was 1370. I'll do the SAT this year. However, my grades are pretty bad, over the last 2 years hovering between a 3.0 and a 3.5 GPA, usually in the middle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've got any more things to say about the school, i'm all ears :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLukas",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nI can only comment on my experiences, and everyone will have their own stories to tell. My experiences will be only so applicable as my degree curriculum has been completely changed since I started. For background on me though, I am an alum who graduated recently working in the industry now from the CS in Game Design degree. I'm not going to lie, this school is incredibly tough due to it's workload it gives its students. The curriculum expect you to be able to juggle around 19-20 credits a semester, making a lot of people stay at school from early morning to late at night. The graduation rate is usually seen as low because of a few factors:\n\n- people come to the school thinking they get to play games all day but are surprised to find out that it's more work then they thought.\n- people cannot financially afford to keep attending anymore.\n- the workload is too high to the point where they couldn't keep up.\n- they got behind on classes to the point where they can't afford another extra 2-3+ semesters to catch up.\n- people switch degrees as they find one not to be as exciting as initially thought (this might impact graduation rate but I'm unsure).\n\nThese are the most common reasons I saw as to why people left.\n\nAs for the copyright question, the school has a strict policy of owning all games produced at the school. Their reasoning is because they don't want teams arguing over what percentage of the team owns what or how much the school owns. So they simplify it by just having the school owns it. However, you can release your game for free on games.digipen.edu for people to play. And just this year they are allowing teams to release their games onto [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=DigiPen%20Institute%20of%20Technology)  which is a nice change.\n\nAs for grades, mine were pretty average to bad, I think I for like a 1450~ SAT and like a low GPA average. I had really good math grades which i think is the only reason I was accepted. I know they are a lot more intense on enrollment now as they want to make sure everyone coming in is capable of passing. My only recommendation is to use the optional essay and convey your passions there.\n\nAs a note, if the graduation rate scares you, don't let it. While this school is definitely tough, you will get a lot of support. This school has amazing professors and some kick ass classmates. Everyone has a passion for what they do and we all try and help each other out where we can. Above any of the factors that can help you pass in 4 years is making sure you are not a lone wolf. Do homework with classmates, -ask questions-, go to tutoring sessions if you need to. There are so many resources to help you if you are in need. And 9 times out of 10 if someone doesn't know the answer, they will direct you to someone who will. I know this might seem obvious, but there are a lot of people who try and be a lone wolf and hence fail.\n\nLet me know if this answers your questions. Feel free to ask any more about industry, school &amp; clubs, or anything else. If be happy to help :)",

Do you happen to know how much prior experience in programming/design would aid my application? By the time i would be attending, i'd have about 3.5 years of experience with the Unreal Engine. I understand that specific engine/program experience isn't that valuable, but I've made some jam games and plan to make some more, along with a passion project I've been working on on the side. Would they value that at all?\n\nAnd secondly, I've heard a lot about how students graduate with a lot of job offers from various companies (which sounds great, having a job mere months after leaving uni), how accurate is that claim?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for all your awesome help :D",

As long as they see that it will help a lot.\n\nSo to be honest, most students struggle to find jobs post graduation. I personally know of like one or two CS students who get multiple offers to choose from. Most of the time you apply heavily everywhere and just accept the first one that comes your way. Luckily as a CS student you can apply for non game jobs and companies won't care. I got into Amazon as a software developer and that didn't care I had my degree in CS in game design. The games industry is extremely competitive, and more often than not we all compete for the same entry level game jobs. I know it sounds bad, but as long as you are committed and have connections (which you hopefully will when you graduate) you'll be fine.",

                                    "comment": "I can attest to the \"connections\" piece of this.  \n\n\nThis may also serve as an example of a rough start in the industry though I was able to stay in it the whole time in some shape or form. (5 jobs within 2 years of joining the game industry)  \n\n\nMy first job came through DigiPen's student fair they do at the end of the year where employers come in and check out what the students have achieved. The person that had a part in hiring me was also a DigiPen alumnus.  \n\n\nThat company went under (Gas Powered Games) and I had to find a new job. I had difficulty finding a design job so I had to take a QA job at Bungie to pay the bills.  \n\n\nAbout half a year goes by and I hear from a buddy, who I met at DigiPen and is still a friend of mine, that the company he was working for was looking for a technical designer so I applied and got the job.  \n\n\nI helped ship the game that I was working on there and get laid off with most of the other people on that project. The company was Zombie Studios which no longer exists though people from that company have formed a new studio that is still around (Hardsuit labs).  \n\n\nThat's where my \"connections\" for getting a job ends when it comes to DigiPen alumni, but my next job came from the previous creative director (I think that was his title) of Zombie who got a job at Z2 which also no longer exists. He enjoyed working with me so much that he reached out to me a couple of months after Zombie went under.  \n\n\nI moved onto a AAA studio from Z2 about 5 years ago now and haven't really looked back. I love what I do and am thankful that I'm able to do this every day.  \n\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I graduated in 2012 from the BSCSGD degree but it was when it was just known as the BSGD degree. I've heard it's changed quite a bit so my experience may be wildly different from current students all I can probably talk about with certainty is my experience in the industry.",

            "comment": "One of the reasons for the copyright is due to the fact that most of the software being used by the school is intended for educational purposes, if I am not mistaken. \n\nOther comments have covered drop out topics fairly well. Workout, stress, finance, etc. One factor I have seen mentioned is sometimes students do not graduate because they have a summer internship (usually junior year) that turns into a full job offer and do not finish their degree as a result. This is less of a common reason for not graduating, but still happens for sure.\n\nI'm an art major so I can't really speak to the other stuff, since I believe grades/SAT are weighted less heavily for the art degree. I do believe, regardless of degree, the application essay is important, as they are looking to ensure you're passionate enough to survive.",

            "comment": "Current BSGD sophomore here. DigiPen has a very rigorous program. There are plenty of resources to be able to handle it: TAs, tutors, office hours, upperclassmen, etc, but you really have to help yourself. Students that drop out largely do so because they try to do everything on their own because they\u2019re too shy/proud/anxious to ask for help. Nobody gets through DigiPen alone. \n\nDigiPen\u2019s classes often don\u2019t *make* students great, but rather, are hard enough that only the students who are putting in the tons of time and energy required, make it through. \n\nYou have to be really driven, and you have to find out that you really love programming (I can only speak for CS degrees), and you have to ask for tons of help. Do those three, nontrivial, things and you\u2019ll be just fine.",

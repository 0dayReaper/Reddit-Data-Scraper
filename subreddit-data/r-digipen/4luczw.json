The regular CS degree seems like an odd choice because AFAIK it doesn't have any real focus on game-related things, but if anyone has any evidence to the contrary I'd love to hear it.\n\nThanks in advance for any answers.",

            "comment": "Greetings, BSGD Alumni here. I would say the key thing to figuring out what you want to do would be to start doing something dealing with it. If you haven't already at least. Programming is definitely a big thing to jump into and see if you enjoy it or not.\n\nBefore I say anything else I will say that DigiPen was the best decision I made when choosing a school to attend at the time I started attending. I think it shaped me to be a better developer and taught me a lot of things about game development. This includes the faculty and the students. BUT, given all of that, it's also extremely expensive and will only be more so when you become old enough to attend(I assume you're just starting early in looking into this stuff).\n\nThere are other alternatives to DigiPen. Other schools that you can attend that are cheaper and teach similar things to what DigiPen does. I work right next to a guy that came from http://eae.utah.edu/ and he's just as competent as I am at programming and game design.\n\nAnother option would be to just start making games. Start with tutorials and go from there. Simply having experience making games gives you a leg up on a lot of college grads trying to get into the industry. Experience will more often than not trump a college degree as well.\n\nIf you plan to make indie games, this is probably your best route as then you won't have to worry about being in tons of debt. (It's tough to do the indie thing when you're in $50,000+ of student loan debt). But I don't know, you could be lucky and all of that is handled for you.\n\nHonestly, if that's the case, I'd say you would be better off in getting a generic CS degree from a state university. You'll find friends there that will have your same interests and if you're driven enough I'm sure you could collaborate and make a game on the side.\n\nBut maybe you're extremely driven, you have the money you need to get into DigiPen and you want to make games, without a doubt in your mind. I'd still say you should still thoroughly consider your options. You have lots of time.\n\nAlso, as I said previously, definitely try out everything you might be interested in to see if you want to do it. Do some programming, try to draw 25 pages of shoes with 4 drawings per page. See if you have a knack for sound work. Time is on your side and there has never been a better time to make a video game.\n\nGood luck on your journey and hopefully what I have said has helped you a bit. Feel free to ask more questions.",

Thanks for the reply. :)\n\nLately I have been trying out a lot of various things, it's partially what has sparked somewhat of a newfound interest in looking at colleges. I do draw plenty, although I'm not exactly an amazing artist (Which is partially why any art-based degrees are completely out of my reach; I'm just up not up to scratch, and doubt I ever will reach that level.) \n\nI've found that out of the things I've tried (Music, art, programming) the latter of the three is what I think I'd be best with a career in. I do love music, but it's not something I think I'd be able to make a career out of (Who knows though. It's not like I'm just going to stop my hobbies once I've got a degree.) \n\nThoroughly considering my options is exactly what I'm trying to do, and a lot of why I'm asking these questions and replying to each of the answers with paragraphs :P.\n\nThis summer I'm going to be spending a lot of my time just continuing to do more things, I have a friend who I can ask for help with CS and programming concepts and someone is actually teaching me compositional theory as we speak ^^. One of the biggest reasons that I've chosen DigiPen is that it seems to offer something for just about everything that I want to do, Comp. Sci, Game Design, Audio Engineering and what-not. Deciding exactly what I want to focus on is probably the hardest choice I've made in a while. If I had it my way, I'd have three different Bachelors' Degrees (And probably over 100k in debt :P.)\n\nAs a GD Alumni, would you know of any quality sources for game design information? Finding Game Design resources is one thing, but finding good game design resources is another thing entirely. ",

Extra Credits would be a good thing to look into though that deals more with gaming as a medium than digging deep into designing a game.\n\nThere's definitely stuff out there, but most of what I know about game design has come from simply making stuff and seeing how people react to it.\n\nAlso, most of the design resources I know of are other designers, haha\n\nCo-workers and such that I have worked with. Sadly, given NDAs and whatnot, I can't exactly talk to designers about my design work unless I work directly with them. That's the way of things right now though.\n\nProgramming will take you a long way in the gaming industry it's something that the industry always needs.\n\nWhat kind of design resources are you looking for? level design, systems design, or?",

All of them a valid answer here? I'd love for just a general starting point for learning about level design. A lot of my problems with learning things on my own is that for a lot of things, just finding the right place to start is harder than anything. \n\n",

            "comment": "If you're asking this question, the answer is not BSGD. The design part of the school is fundamentally not up to where the CS department is. There are a lot of reasons why, and I have my own ideas, but the CS department has ~20 years of experience over the design side, and that alone is enough to make a big difference.\n\nI've seen a lot of my friends swap to BSCS or RTIS from BSGD and they've all been much happier for it. BSGD is a damn hard degree, because it's essentially most of the difficult CS courses from RTIS, and the very time consuming game design classes from BAGD/BAID, but smooshed together in an insane blend. Very few people who start BSGD finish it, even fewer finish in 4 years. The only people who are really happy with this degree that I know of are the ones that just *have* to be designing.\n\nDon't bother with a minor. It's not really going to make you much more hirable, and you don't want to spent your time on difficult GD/Art core classes instead of on better CS skills. You can get a PHY or MAT minor pretty easily if you go RTIS, though.\n\nThe BSCS can use their Computer Science Project slot to take GAM class and make a game the same as the RTIS degree, and that's both degrees' real game-focused class. The big difference is that BSCS gets more networking and databases, while RTIS gets more graphics programming (and I think physics too?). The real takeaway is that they share enough classes that you shouldn't worry which you want yet. You can decide after you come here and learn for a year, and just change painlessly if you want to.\n\nsource: am going into junior year BSGD",

Thanks for the 'warning' about the Game Design course, because it probably would have been my default if I hadn't made a more concrete choice at that point, now it's looking more like it'd be the regular CS class. \n\nI'm still rather iffy on the whole minor thing, I can see how taking Art or Game Design classes (especially how you've described them) would make it a lot more difficult to manage the already (Or so I've heard) heavy workload, but I'd still like to at least look into getting the music minor, because music is also something I'm very passionate about.\n\nA bit off-topic, but since you did mention being in BSGD, if I recall Digipen allows you to take classes sans the tuition/enrollment and whatnot fees for the first two years after you graduate. Since you said that GD courses have a pretty high workload (or a time-consuming one, at least) do you think it would be prudent to use some of that time to take Game Design classes (Because it is also something I'm very interested in!) without having to deal with the mashed-together schedule of BSGD, or would it be a better move to take some of the classes I would miss from the other (BSCS/RTIS) degree to round out my skillset a bit more so to speak?",

If you're really passionate about that kind of thing, you might want to look into the BSESD (BS in Engineering and Sound Design). It has a lot of the same CS courses that the other CS degrees have, but adds sound design and audio programming to the mix. There aren't a ton of people in that program, so I don't know it well, but they all seem happy with it.\n\nSince you're intending on getting a CS degree, you won't really have any need to take classes after graduation. The vast majority of RTIS grads have no trouble finding jobs, and I assume the same will be true for BSCS and BSESD when those are old enough to give us that data. If you do take classes after graduation, though, I would personally recommend the GD stuff, since I think that having the dual skillset is very useful for being able to communicate with both sides, although I'm obviously biased. If you intend to go AAA, you won't really need that much in-depth knowledge in the other branches of CS, because if you're a kickass network engineer, you'll just get hired as a network engineer, and someone else will get hired to do audio, graphics, etc. If you want to go indie, though, being able to do, say, graphics programming, audio programming, networking and sound design yourself would be a boon.",

Furthermore the BSESD program is being polished for the coming years. The new schedule has you taking GAM100-375 (same as RTIS), the only difference is that once you get into GAM300 you will also take MUS370 which is the sound equivalent of the GAM class. \n\nLastly, even if you are a BSESD on a GAM team, it doesn't mean you are forced to do the sound engine, you can and will do other things to contribute, and you will not be expected to make any music or sound effects for your game until you get to MUS370 (but you can if you want).\n\n\nIf you want some more specifics shoot me a pm and I can give you further detail.",

The team that I was on for senior year was planning on doing something in the CryEngine.\n\nIn my junior year for the BSGD degree (I think that is BSCSGD as well?) we were tasked with building games in whatever engine we wanted to use so in theory you could try to build something in one of those engines. (As people did for both of the above engines).\n\nI'm sure that class has changed though and is probably dependent on the teacher you have.",

            "comment": "The school has its own proprietary engine The Zero Engine. You can take a look at the documentation but currently it is only available to students. \n\nZero.DigiPen.edu\n\nFreshman BSCSRTIS, BSCSGD, and BAGD students use Zero for their freshman games. They spend the first semester familiarizing themselves with the engine and making a basic game in small teams over the last four weeks of the fall semester. Second semester freshman use Zero to make a game in small teams over the entire spring semester.\n\nSophomores BS degrees have to work in a custom engine. The RTIS degree students front line the engine work and CSGD students handle design and gameplay usually. BAGD's usually end up on all designer teams that are allowed to work in a prebuilt engine. The same thing pretty much goes for junior year.\n\nSenior year many students get internships instead of gam400 which is basically make a game however you want.\n\nDon't make the naive mistake of thinking because you aren't actually taught unity or unreal the education is useless outside the school. Once you've learned one engine it is much easier to learn the next one. It is also something a game developer should be good at. You will probably not work at the same studio forever. Unity and Unreal are awesome, but big studios often make their own engines.\n\nPersonally I like the Zero Engine. I think it is much easier to use and learn overall than Unity and Unreal. When I (and many of my friends) started learning Unity and Unreal after Zero on our own time, it came very easily. They are different tools that use different approaches to the same goals which creates many similarities. Zero is definitely still under development, but in my time at the school it evolved immensely.",

Keep in mind the vast majority of the engine is entirely custom, the only stuff that isn't is stuff that is unreasonably difficult to write from scratch (think reimplementation of things like the PNG standard and importer/exporter.) So right now UI probably won't improve a lot for about 6 months or so, but after that they'll be able to iterate on it much easier. \n\nOther than that, they really do spend a lot of time trying to do things better than Unity and Unreal. Right now there's a plug-in system coming down the line that will be far better than what Unity has. And Zilch certainly has a problem in that it's an up-and-comer brand new language, but it's a genuinely nice one, and with things like the plug-ins system (Written in C++) it'll be much nicer to use than C# (Via Managed C++) or JavaScript (Via Node.js). \n\nAlso they're still evaluating moving Zilch over to using an LLVM backend to get their optimizer as well as native speed. \n\nI can't speak to how it directly compared to Unity or Unreal as I haven't personally used them, but I am aware of those things I just mentioned. On the flip side I know Zero doesn't have stuff like playing a movie for like game intros or whatever. But if you have questions please ask. ",

    "postText": "I'm a prospective student at DigiPen, and I've been considering the BFA (Digital Art &amp; Animation) degree. \n\n\nAt first I was torn between the BFA and BADG, but this video cleared some things up for me: https://youtu.be/H36ltS4MaSU\n\n\nI specifically want to be a **game artist**. As in, I want to be a digital concept artist or a 3D modeler. I felt I needed to specify that, as there are so many fallacies in the distinctions between programmers, developers, designers, artists, etc. \n\n\nAccording to the video, the BFA is more up my alley. He even states in the video, \"Don't be fooled by the fact that the BFA degree does not have the word 'game' in it. That's game art.\" However, according to several people on this sub, DP is outright lying, and the BFA is actually more tailored to suit the film industry than the game industry. Can anyone confirm or deny this? \n\n\nLastly, after visiting a certain post (https://www.reddit.com/r/digipen/comments/2yzwgc/looking_to_apply_as_a_bfa_maybe_dont_im_not_a_bfa/), I've become concerned with the treatment of students in the BFA program. How much truth is there to these reports? If they are factual, has it gotten any better in the last 2 years? ",

            "comment": "Currently a freshmen BFA, so I can only give you definitive info on the first semester. I don't know too much about the game vs film track, as we get into our introduction to those next semester;\n\nAs mentioned previously, the first semester is all about the basics. Drawing in perspective, both with accurately and with as realistic as possible. This first semester drawing class doesn't touch on anything like the figure or creatures. Just structures, basic shapes, and eventually interior/exterior spaces.\nPainting is along the same lines, where perspective is still important, but you focus more on painting with correct values, choosing the best color schemes, and painting exactly what you see. (This was the class I had the most trouble with). \nAnimation is mainly about doing basic movements, starting from nailing down timing and spacing (to create a smooth animation), and moving up to bouncing balls, jumps, and walks.\n\nThe other three classes generally don't have much work, but it's basically Art History, Creative Writing, and College Skills/Digipen Resources.\n\nThe grading system employed here is harsh, but designed to encourage improvement. Resubmits are allowed for a window of two weeks, which gives you the chance to retry or edit your work if you're having difficulty. Your teachers won't activrly try to fail you if you're having trouble, and are always available to meet with or email.\n\nThe teachers I've had so far are undoubtedly the best art teachers I've had yet. They are encouraging, while also not trying to sugarcoat your mistakes. In order to do well in the industry, your work needs to be the best effort you can put forward, and they drill this into your head from day one. If you consistently put forward your best, and are falling short, the teachers will often give you additional extensions to retry an assignment (my painting instructor did this for me for an early assignment, which was extremely beneficial as I bumped my grade up by 15 points).\nIt may seem hard or exhausting when resubmits start piling up, but I look at my work before starting Digipen, and where I'm at now, there's a massive improvement, so all of the time spent working and reworking is absolutely worth it. Also keep in mind that they're trying to teach you extensive techniques/skills in a single week timeframe, where it generally takes much much longer to master them. \n\nAs for homework workload, it's tough. I won't lie. If you have difficulty managing multiple, multi-step assignments, I wouldn't recommend Digipen, you'll burn out fairly quickly (I'd guess that nearly 1/3 of BFA students that started this year have dropped out already). I've managed my work by dividing it into small portions each day and I'm normally up until 11pm or midnight working on homework. \nThe average workload per week is a drawing assignment (ex: six Thumbnails, references, and a final product), a painting assignment (ex: six thumbnails, 2 final paintings), an animation project (ex: a full bouncing ball animation), and two reading assignment.\nLike I said earlier, the workload is tough and time consuming, but the improvements I've seen in myself, and the feedback from my instructors is massive.\n\nI can't speak for the other instructors that teach BFA courses, but I have heard complaints against a few, and there are one or two that I've heard can be real problematic in terms of the amounts of work assigned. From what I've seen and heard, the BFA program is a lot better than what it was a few years back, but there are always issues to be ironed out.\n\nIn summary, if your goal is to become a game concept artist/modeler, and nothing is ever going to change your mind, then I would recommend Digipen. The work is tough and demanding, but the results are absolutely worth the amount of time spent. \n\n",

Painting, drawing and animation (the main three) meet twice per week; once for a lecture that details new skills and upcoming assignments, and once for a lab class that allows us to practice new the techniques and get a general idea of what the instructors want for the homework. Art History and Creative Writing meet twice per week as well, but don't have lecture classes. The College Skills class meets only once per week.\n\nHowever, I'm often at Digipen around thirty hours or so, generally because I tend to work on homework that requires equipment that the school has. I prefer to work on my assignments at home, so I tend to stay at the school to work on Animation homework or creative writing assignments, since I have immediate access to the network drives and lightables for animations. Drawing and painting are things I prefer to do at home.\n\nYou are free to set up your classes however you like, provided you choose from a list of time slots. Each class has different sections, so for example, Drawing has sections A-E, each one meeting at different times, with different instructors. Section A could meet at 9am, while section D meets at 1pm, and so on. The differing times are only for lab classes, as the lectures are taught in one of the larger rooms that the entire freshmen BFA's attend all at the same time. The lectures are typically towards the beginning of the week, in the mornings.\nOnly animation, painting and drawing have lecture classes.\n\nHope this helps!",

DigiPen's rationale is that it makes you a better artist, and I'd assume the fact that it gives you more job opportunities in film is another plus for them. (harsh reality: there are too many people who want to be artists competing for too few jobs in games) I can't say I know how effective doing so much art by hand is, but I have no complaints about the digital art I've seen created here, so there's that.\n\nThat first post in the other Reddit thread is pretty much on point, although the long awaited artist integration into game teams is finally at a good point. (after way too long)\n\nAs far as the 8chan post, that seems mostly accurate unfortunately. Teachers don't show up to the town halls, it's just the dept head or heads for the first half, and student services for the second. There have been and still continue to be serious unprofessionalism issues from BFA teachers, serious mental health issues among the student body, especially BFAs, and lots of technical issues that IT can't or won't solve, especially with art software. I wasn't at that town hall since I'm not a BFA, but I heard my friends talk about it and it sounded miserable.  Do bear in mind though that the 8chan was a drama-filled cesspool, and anything from there is likely exaggerated to some extent, though. \n\nIf you're concerned about your mental health, I can't really wholeheartedly endorse DigiPen. It puts you through a wringer. You come out skilled if you come out, but that's a serious if and can come at a huge mental cost.",

            "comment": "BFA upperclassman here. \n\nYou need to be a BFA. BAGD won't cut it. It's not the right degree to be an artist in the industry. I don't know who on this sub is claiming that the BFA is a film centric degree, but they're wrong. You have the option to make films or games from the second you start your first major project. The program itself is absolutely tailored towards game, and I say this as someone who wants to be in film. I just got back from CTN - the film industry wants specialists. DigiPen does not make specialists. It makes generalists with a speciality, which is what the game industry loves. \n\nI think the \"poor treatment\" thing is overblown. It's hard work. No one disputes that. But the professors do genuinely care about you. Even my worst professor - who no longer teaches the class I took with him - cared about me and did not want me to fail. \n\nThe trick is communication. You have to be your own advocate. Town halls and art council are great, but they're not going to fix your problem. You have to talk to the prof, discuss your problem, and ask if you need something other than what's listed on the syllabus. \n\nThe professors will not sugarcoat things. They'll tell you what's wrong and how to fix it. You will always have the option to resubmit. But if you don't communicate, that is your own fault. \n\nThe program is too small for the faculty not to care about you. To keep accreditation, you have to be employed in the industry after you graduate. When there's only 40 graduates, 75% employment means every single one matters. \n\nThey're always working out kinks. Profs are hired and fired a lot. Curriculum changes. The year I started was the year they overhauled the BFA entirely. Our cohort is a bunch of guinea pigs, but you know what we do when something's not right? We bitch about it until it's fixed. And most of the time, it gets fixed. Jazno and Ray and all the people who head up the degree have their oddities, but none of them want you to fail. They're preparing you for a tough industry and a lot of the time it's tough love. But it's never malicious. ",

It's like any art position - if you're good, you'll get a job whether you have a degree or not. A lot of artists also fall into fantasy territory and get really stuck in what's essentially a dead field. You're not going to get work as a concept artist or a 2D animator unless you're *really* good. Period. And you're competing against all the incredible 2D animators that have been in this field for 30 years but don't have steady employment because the big studios don't make 2D films anymore. \n\nThey've started to try talking to BFAs about careers earlier, and I think it has helped, but one of the pitfalls is that you don't start anything 3D until you're a sophomore. The traditional basis is great and super helpful as an artist, but not helpful when you have a year at best to prep for internship positions. The really major studios for artists are practically unheard of unless you have several years of your discipline under your belt before you come to DigiPen. It's not a knock on the school, believe me, it's just a fact of life. Mastering something takes time.\n\nI'd suggest dipping your toes into a lot of different disciplines and trying out Blender or Maya (Maya is the industry standard) if you can. I took rigging to make myself a better 3D animator and I think it's what my focus is going to be for the rest of my time at school.  It's a much more technical side of art that I never knew I would enjoy as much as I do. Knowing what you like and applying what you learn in class to personal projects is really useful. Keep in mind: 3D is where the money is. It's a lot easier to work in this industry as a 3D artist, whether that's animation, modeling, texturing, rigging, etc. If you really want to make the big bucks, get 8 internships and a great job straight out of school, be a lighting and compositing artist who knows how to code Python. They're practically nonexistent. If you want to be a 2D artist, be prepared to work for itty bitty indie companies for a long time doing a lot of different disciplines. There are members of last year's senior class that haven't found industry jobs yet, but it's not the lighting artists.\n\nCall up career services and ask for the hard numbers! I know they track them. They're also somewhere on the website as well. ",

Like the ones who are more successful are the ones who just do one super technical thing really well, instead of masters of drawing itself. I just want to make sure I'm getting the big picture. \n\nI've been trying really hard to improve my foundational drawing skills, and it's a bit of a bummer to consider that working on drawing might not be as helpful as learning the technical skills for the programs (assuming I understood that right!). DP's focus on foundations was a big part of the reason I felt like it's the real deal, but it's a bit of a headspinner to think it might not be best suited for the jobs that are out there.

Professors are fond of saying that you can adapt to new programs, but you can't pull understanding of art out of a 30 minute tutorial. \n\nI'd say you don't need to be the best artist to be successful and employed, but you need to be at a certain level of competency or you end up SOL. My friend paints incredibly well, but she can still turn to me (who paints like shit) and ask for crit because I have an artist eye just like she does.\n\nOverall, DigiPen is one of the best bets you have in terms of a comprehensive art education to get you into the industry. The program does produce generalists rather than specialists, but you come out knowing the pipeline for everything and prepared for curveballs the industry throws at you. \n\nIt just doesn't have time in four years to make you a full blown specialist without sacrificing your fundamental understanding of art. You have to push yourself into your own specialty, and doing this before school even starts is super helpful in guiding your steps through DigiPen. ",

I have never really thought a lot about a specialized role involving 3D, but I am going to do some thinking for sure. I really love character design and 2D animation, but I absolutely want to have a stable job after going through DP! Do love watching and appreciate 3D animation, and I definitely need to think more about that side of things. Thanks a bunch.",

It's just a lot harder to make it :I \n\nGood luck, and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions! I wouldn't still be at Digipen if I didn't believe in it. 3D can really be something you grow to love! Check out animsaurus, animschool, or a couple of the other online animation certification places and try to get a feel for how it all works in 3D. I know I came into Digipen with 2D animation and character design in my sights as well, and I've turned out to adore 3D and even lean into technical art. Something about it just clicked with me. ",

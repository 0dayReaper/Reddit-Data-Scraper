    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm currently considering doing a second bachelors degree at Digipen in either the RTIS or CS program (First bachelors is in Industrial Engineering) and I just see a lot of different points of view about the school and program.\n\n1 - How good are the current programs overall? Are they only good for the game industry or are they also good enough to compete with other general cs programs from other universities?\n\n2 - How is Digipen's current recognition in the games industry and outside of it.\n\n3 - What kind of projects are done in the regular CS program (they are listed differently on the class list).\n\n4 - I heard that social life is not a thing in the school or the area around it. That is fine, but can a more sociable person find things to do with relative ease?\n\n5 - Is it true that if someone goes to Digipen for one of these programs they will be either useless or in a handicap outside of the industry?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for taking the time to help me out!",

Most companies are not going to make a hiring decision based on where your degree comes from, so just be sure to use your time at DigiPen wisely, and you'll be able to work anywhere.\n\n2) Very good.  I graduated in 2004 and work as a Senior Engineer on Minecraft.  We have dozens of other DigiPen grads working here, and working at Microsoft in general... plus Amazon, Google, etc.\n\n4) I believe this is overstated - the issue is really that your school becomes your life, and there are plenty of opportunities to hang out with other dP students.  If you need a break from them, there's an absolute TON of things to do, and there are other colleges around (University of Washington, for example) if you want to hang out with people from there.  I did that a lot, as they have a lot of clubs and things that don't require you to be a UW student.\n\n5) This seems quite false, considering all the places that my friends have worked.",

Also, my programming experience is not very deep, but I am actually already working on a game project so I do have a grasp of programming logic, etc. Is the degree viable in this setting or it ends up being aimed to people that are already very good at programming?",

I had been programming since I was 12, but it was in Visual Basic, Pascal, and only about a year of working in C/C++.  That knowledge was all eclipsed within the first few months of DigiPen.  It's intense.  It's hard.  And most people don't graduate.  But if you do, it's incredibly rewarding.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from the Bscs program and can speak at least most of these questions.\n\n1 - Difficult to answer how good something is. I don't think you could make it though this program without being a good C++ programmer by the end, but the teaching for a lot of the higher level concepts most programs focus on is pretty weak.\n\n2 - I got an interview at a local indie game studio thru the digipen internship fair, and an interview at Microsoft because the principal engineer on the team saw DigiPen on my resume and put me thru. The name recognition is there. It's worth noting it goes both ways, as I've heard a few non-games companies like Google will dismiss digipen resumes because they've had a lot of bad candidates before for there. In short digipen grads are just about everywhere by this point so a lot of hiring managers know the name.\n\n3 - I chose for all my project classes to be in with the game projects, the difference in the CS program is you get to choose. Essentially the model is you can pitch what you want to do to the instructor and the go do it. It's worth noting almost everyone in the CS program just did the game project.\n\n4 - Redmond doesn't have much in the way of night life, there are a few bars around but that's it. The lack of socialization at Digipen is exaggerated and the opportunities are there if you look for them. Just don't expect a party school, that's just not the scene. Seattle and Bellevue aren't too far away if you're looking for more full on night life, I know of a few people who my that way\n\n5 - I'm working at Microsoft no where near games, I have friends at Amazon and Google no where near games. The RTIS program doesn't go too deep into a lot of topics that aren't needed in game dev, so things like databases and advanced networking aren't gone into in much depth there. The full CS program fills those gaps at the cost of the advanced graphics and physics courses that aren't really useful beyond games.\n\nOverall I'm really happy with the program as it worked out great for me, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone without a lot of caveats. The trial by fire approach is not great for mental health, and the gaps in knowledge you end up with from the schools focus might be awkward later on. The quality of teaching staff ranges from pretty bad to the best programming teacher I've had.",

                            "comment": "To me, I think it was worth the trade off as while the people in my office know more than me about things like design patterns and databases, recent grads from more traditional CS programs don't even come close when it comes to the lower level knowledge DigiPen focuses on. Because the DigiPen CS program is designed to make sure you understand what you're building on top of, it takes until Junior/Senior year to start getting the advanced algorithms. A lot of the areas where the main curriculum is weak can also be boosted by electives if you're particularly concerned that you need to understand databases. Often the material is available but not required.\n\nIt really depends where you want to work, if you want to work in an area where performance is critical so a knowledge of C++/C/Assembly and how to write parallel code is needed, DigiPen is by far the better choice. If you want to write back-end software at a major web company, maybe less so.",

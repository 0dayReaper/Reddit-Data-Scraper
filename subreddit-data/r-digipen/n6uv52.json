            "comment": "I've seen Singapore to US transfers work with credits successfully transferred, but not US &gt; Singapore yet. The modules are designed so that US credits can transfer seamlessly into the Singapore course though, that's the basis of Overseas Immersion Programme for Singapore students visiting Redmond. Won't the transfer process be extremely delayed due to COVID, though?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you aren't asking this in particular, but I can't recommend transferring freshman year credits if you intend to finish your degree in Singapore. Even if the modules are the same, the stuff taught would likely be in a different style UNLESS it's for math, physics etc. Courses after the freshman year hit the ground running, assuming you know EXACTLY what was taught prior. This could end up in you having to 'catch up' with deadlines snowballing on you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor most courses freshman year is where foundational courses are taught and a hectic work pace is established, especially for BFA. Lecturers have no qualms repeatedly failing students in core modules, unless they hit a specific standard (which can rack up into crazy costs). I mean, the first two years for most courses are already stressful for locals who are used to Singapore's homework-spamming education system. From what I've experienced in both campuses, both have their teaching style and benefits/flaws but the Singapore campus is especially taxing early on. If I was a foreigner coming in on the second year having to adapt on the fly AND make new friends, I would (personally) break down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are confident in your ability and/or social skills, then ignore my second+third paragraph! Otherwise, I'd urge you to consider retaking important freshman modules.",

(this was my opener I think and a very small bit of the essay.)\n* what I hope to do with the knowledge gained from a CS degree.\n* what I have done in the past that informed my decision to go into video game programming. (I made games in gamemaker studio but felt limited because I didn't know a programming language. I created the soundtrack on an indie game and loved working as a team and wanted to do more. etc)\n* why I chose digipen specifically. (because it is known to be a very difficult school, don't remember how I justified that as a good thing.)",

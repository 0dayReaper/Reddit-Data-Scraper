    "postText": "Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone happened to know the average GRE score of those in the MS CS program? I scored a little lower than I would have liked, but enough to pay another $200 and take it again. I haven't received the official scores yet but from I saw at the end of the test, I don't think my quantitative score is quite up to the 70th percentile.",

I saw that on the website as well, but I was just curious since it refers to the combined score instead of the individual, and I was having trouble finding anything on google about combined scores and percentiles. All else fails I could definitely email admissions",

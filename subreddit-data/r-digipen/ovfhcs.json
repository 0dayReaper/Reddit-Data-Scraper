    "postText": "I realize Digi has a high drop out rate. Does anyone have any stats on which majors account for the high drop out rate. I am specifically interested in the BAGD program, but my number one fear of going to Digi is that it seems like they almost pride themselves in their drop out rate. Any input would be great.",

It brings the averages of graduates up, obviously, but isn't so great for the ones culled.",

            "comment": "There's definitely a culture of survival of the fittest there, for better or for worse.\nI graduated in 2018 and from what I saw, they just accept way too many damn people. Kids that think they want to make video games, but don't know what that really means. Kids with no ability to live on their own and self discipline. And kids that just don't know what they want at all. \nCombine that with a very high level of difficulty and you get a high dropout rate. \nYou have to know you want to go there, know what that means, and be prepared to give your life away for the better part of 4 years. \n\nBut hey, if you make it, it's more than worth it.",

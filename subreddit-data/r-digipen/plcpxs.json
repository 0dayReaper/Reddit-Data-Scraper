    "postText": "I was just looking through admissions for Digipen and now I have some questions. I'm actually not taking precalc this year and I bombed my Junior year of math due to covid although I'm currently still maintaining a 3.75 gpa. How are those affecting my odds. Also, I saw that it requires a portfolio of creative works. Would character concepts and videogame essays work?",

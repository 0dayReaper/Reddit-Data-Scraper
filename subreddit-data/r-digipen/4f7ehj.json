            "comment": "The BS in computer science or any computer science program here? Because all the BS degrees are CS degrees.\n\nAs a freshman BSESD (with a couple years of college prior to here) I can tell you that:\n\nthe core C/C++ classes with Mead are amazing and probably some of the best courses I've ever taken. \n\nThe assembly class (CS100) is a bit lackluster, but you get to do some really cool things and can learn a lot if you put in the effort and read the recommended book. \n\nCS230 (Game implementation techniques) has also been a bit lackluster, but they're in the middle of revamping the course to give students more experience in component-based architecture in C++, so it might be a really solid class by the time you're here. \n\nGAM classes can be good or bad, depending on how much you put into them (especially 150).\n\nThe math classes are also quite good. Especially with Boerkoel and Klassen.\n\nAnything more specific you're curious about?",

If you're talking about interesting stories, just last week professor Mead played guitar for the entire class (he's a heck of a guitarist). If you mean cool things we get to do, I programmed a self driving tank with some friends last term. That was pretty neat.",

                            "comment": "\"Special\"? Not really, maybe I'm just used to it after 4 years? It's just the things you do that are special rather than the course itself. Example of this would be ai for games you do a talk on whatever you want that's related to game ai. Everyone researched something insanely different which I thought a few were really interesting. It's also nice to have master students in your class since they're expected to do something of much higher quality, although in this course they just write a longer paper..  \n\nI'm not BSCS, but I am BSCSRTIS which is more or less the same degree with like a half dozen to a dozen courses that are different.. if you have any random question feel free to message me.

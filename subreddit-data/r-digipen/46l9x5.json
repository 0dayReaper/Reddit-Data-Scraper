Looks like the apartment I was at is now in the $1700+ range.\n\nhttp://www.essexapartmenthomes.com/washington/seattle-area/bellevue/emerald-ridge\n\nThat doesn't include power or internet which will most likely run you $100 and another $100 or so respectively in total.\n\nGroceries, if you're living on the cheap will probably run you $100-150 every two weeks.\n\nSo in total you're looking at around $2300+ per month. Though for me I only paid half my rent so that would put costs at around $1450.\n\nHopefully that gives a decent estimate. That obviously doesn't include entertainment like games, eating out and other things of that sort.\n\nI handled all my costs through student loans (Avoid this at all costs if you can, but it got me through DigiPen and I am working at a pretty sweet place)",

Lived there for 2 years, the management is pretty good (I don't think they've changed since), and it's well within walking distance, plus there's a shuttle. Just find some roommates to lower the cost. I was living in a 1234ft^2 \"two bedroom\" apartment with 3 other people (2 in the master bedroom, myself in the second bedroom, and a friend in the \"den\" that was really just a bedroom with double doors) for only about $1200/mo. overall.\n\nIf you're willing to spend a little extra, Avalon (either Redmond Place or ParcSquare) has fantastic management and nice rooms, though they're a little smaller.\n\nAvoid Shadowbrook and Trailwood. Scarborough has the same parent company as Shadowbrook iirc. \"The Summit\" used to be Samammish Ridge, and was really good (family business) but has since been bought by someone, though they might not have ruined it.",

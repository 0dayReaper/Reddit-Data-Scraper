You can pay half the price for your own room (as opposed to sharing a room in student housing) if you organise it yourself.\n\nCampus is just a big building where everyone goes to class and has the cafe and big lab rooms.\n\nIt's a very nice area, more a town than a city\n\nAdvice: Make sure you can pay for all 4 years.\n\ngrats!

It can be good to have official mediation should something go wrong.\n\n&gt;Head's up on what's campus like?\n\nTiny and slightly cramped, but full of great equipment and nice people.\n\n&gt;Anything about the area in general I should know?\n\nIt rains. A lot. Get ready for that\n\n&gt;Anything major advice before actually accepting? (Going for CS&amp;GD)\n\nHow committed are you to game design? Are you absolutely sure it's what you want to do with your life? I ask because it's not terribly applicable to other things and not always the most marketable skill, luckily the CS will bolster your marketability. Not that game design is bad and shouldn't be studied, but I would say 50% of my cohort is in one of the two GD programs. All this to say you're going to have a lot of competition and you should enter the ring swinging.\n\nCongrats on getting accepted by the way. That's a damn great feeling :)",

With any one one or those you get more specialized and in-depth programming knowledge. It really just depends what you want to do. RTIS is for graphics programming, BSESD is for audio engine programming, and the BSCS is an all around CS degree on steroids so you could work on game engines, networking or really whatever you feel like taking for electives or learning during extra projects.\n\nI wouldn't really say those programs have it easier than the GDs, but they do have more job security. If you aren't really interested in being a designer, it's strongly consider doing a different degree (assuming you decide to go here of course)",

Bsgd is only partially useful for non games positions. If you aren't absolutely 100% sure you want to be a game designer and nothing else is adequate, you should heavily consider going rtis and just taking an active role in design on your game teams, and possibly taking design classes as electives.\n\nAs rtis it's not uncommon to get internships at companies like amazon and microsoft in a non games position because your cs skills are the primary focus, but it's much less common for a gd student to do that.",

I don't have the link handy, but a few years ago, Digipen was the most expensive, for-profit college in the Northwest...good chance it still holds that position.  Fill out your FAFSA _now_ and then your new part time job is applying for every scholarship you might even tangentially be qualified for.  \n\n*2 - You will be paying whatever the listed price is.  And if that price doesn't go up for next year, it will the following.  Over the long run though, the best way you'll make your DP degree cheaper is to take whatever community college classes you can that will transfer.  Search the rest of this subreddit for information on transferring classes.  The caveat to this is the \"Computer Engineering\" program, if you keep your grades up you only pay %25 what everyone else is.  [Es verdad!](http://news.digipen.edu/financial-aid/new-scholarships-available-for-the-b-s-in-computer-engineering/#.VPZVPvnF98E)\n\n*3 - DP housing is expensive, but that is true of all housing around the campus.  You won't be spending a lot of time at home your first year, so if you can Harry Potter it under someones stairs, that's what I would do.  With a little digging, you should be able to find others to share a lease with, or someone to sub-lease a room from; what you'll find depends on how far out you are willing to live from the school.\n\n*4 - Oddly enough, I think the best snapshot on what the campus is like is to ask to join the \"Diginaps\" Facebook group.\n\n*5 - You're in PA?  I'm a transplant to Baltimore.  The Eastside is overcast and drizzly.  We heard thunder one time, spring of 2010.  The school was closed about one day per semester for snow (excluding summer).  As an East Coast driver you'll be one of the worst drivers on the road (be honest, you can't remember the last time you used your turn signal).\n\n*6 - Don't accept now, wait a year.  Do. Not. Go. Now.  Demolish what classes you can at whatever school is closest to you.  \n\n",

            "comment": "BSGD Alum here.\n\nHere's my story with debt and DigiPen.\n\nMy parents had zero money saved up for college and I didn't apply to any scholarships/felt like there were none for my demographic.\n\nI'm sure that's not fully true though.\n\nBack to debt.\n\nI got loans for everything with the help of my parents and grandma and graduated from DigiPen with about $100,000 in debt.\n\nI pay about $700 per month to pay off that debt. That doesn't include a section of debt that I have been able to stave off for the time being.\n\nTo get perspective, I pay about $975 per month for rent on my apartment. So, I'm essentially paying rent every two weeks. It sucks and is stifling financially.\n\nI have been in the industry for about 3 years or so and I have just started getting jobs where I feel financially stable.\n\nMy Advice, be absolutely certain you want to be a designer. It's not about how good your ideas are, it's about how well you can execute those ideas(I know you have said nothing about this but it comes up a lot). Most of the time, unless you're creating your own game or working on an indie team, the things you are developing are not your ideas anyway. They are your lead's ideas or your producer's ideas or whoever has the vision of the game.\n\nSo yeah, basically what others have said. Be very certain that you want to be a designer. If you really don't care, RTIS/whatever programming degree is the way to go without a doubt.\n\nAlso, programming jobs outside of the gaming industry pay considerably more and you can get a degree in programming for considerably less by not going to DigiPen. You're definitely at an advantage in some cases when graduating from DigiPen as a programmer though (RTIS, no idea how well thought out the other, newer, programming degrees are).\n\nOn top of all of this. Programming in other industries, web, non-game applications, for the most is considerably easier/less performance-centric than games. Essentially, are games worth getting paid less, working more hours, and working on more complex problems? Do you love games that much? You may not be able to answer that question but it's something to consider.\n\nAs always, feel free to ask more questions.\n\nI'll tell you whatever I know.",

After doing some thinking and reading, I'm 50/50 on switching after accepting. I'll decide on that after going to the open house on april.  \nReading some of the posts here and on various other forums alot of people that are/were/dropped out of the BSGD program felt that the teachers were incompetent, or the classes were laid out terribly, or the administration did do anything to help fix their problems. What was your experience with that?",

That's just how it goes.\n\nI feel like a lot of students go into the design program expecting it to be something completely different from what it is and they can't cut it so they complain that something is wrong with the curriculum when it's most likely something up with their work ethic or design sense.\n\nThough, a lot of people dislike the \"trial by fire\" approach which is a lot of what DigiPen is. In essence, you're given the tools for what you need to do but not really told how to do it. It can be frustrating, but when you do learn how to do whatever it is that you're trying to do you definitely know it.\n\nDigiPen supplies you the environment to learn and connect with other people that enjoy games which helps a lot when trying to figure out how to make games.\n\nI'll be honest though, there are definitely issues with the curriculum and management of the school. Poor handling of student greivances is a thing or at least it was when I attended but it was never something that I felt would damage my experience at the school. It always seemed to be in the background and people were frustrated that changes were not happening.\n\nSo yeah, DigiPen is a mixed bag but I feel like I received a great education from them and I owe my first few jobs(not to say that I lacked skills, but I had no experience except for student work) to having simply been a graduate of the school.\n\nIt really comes down to whether you want to work in the game industry or not. If you can take it or leave it, you're better off going to another school.\n\nLike I said before, working in the game industry is sexy but it doesn't pay as well as other industries and you tend to work longer hours.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.\n\nApologies for the delayed response.

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an international student and I was really worrying about the portfolio when applying for Game Art because I believe I have an incredibly strong essay, and strong 3D art, however my drawing skills are doubtful. How important is drawing skills? What was your portfolio like? \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hello, not too many artists from DigiPen watch this subreddit unfortunately. I graduated from the BSGD program in 2012 so my knowledge could be outdated.  \n\n\nIf not much has changed in the art program typically your first 2 years of DigiPen are dedicated to 2D art related skills. To determine if that is still the case I would suggest reading the course descriptions in the game art curriculum on DigiPen's website.  \n\n\nWith all of that said I would imagine that you don't have to be great at the hand drawn stuff you just have to show \"potential\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get a better idea on what the expectations are you can also contact admissions at DigiPen who likely gets questions like this all of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have an email address:\n\n[https://www.digipen.edu/contact-us](https://www.digipen.edu/contact-us)\n\n [admissions@digipen.edu](mailto:admissions@digipen.edu)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to you!",

I'm sure they'll get back to you in January.\n\nMy experience at DigiPen was that I basically dedicated my life to DigiPen for 4 years and didn't do much else. It's possible to do other things you just have to budget your time well.\n\nWas I well regarded by game studios for going to DigiPen?\n\nI'm not sure if I can answer that directly given my journey through the game industry.\n\nMy first job in the industry came from an alumni who was hiring for the company they worked for. (So the person hiring knew full well the requirements of the school)\n\nMy 2nd job was a QA position that I had to take due to the first job having laid off most of the team. (For this one I was asked if I'd stay with the job due to my degree/being over qualified but they might ask that for any person with a Bachelor's degree or higher.)\n\nMy 3rd job came through someone I made friends with at DigiPen. (So more of a network thing)\n\nMy 4th job came from the creative director I met at the 3rd job. (Obviously more network related)\n\nMy 5th job came from a shot in the dark. (Sent a resume to the company through an application on the company website). It's possible that HR contacted me for the 5th job due to my DigiPen degree but I imagine some of it was related to my experience up to that point as well. I have been working here ever since and am happy where I'm at.\n\nSo, in my experience, a huge benefit to graduating from DigiPen is the inherent network you'll build while attending DigiPen and the network of people out in the industry who have graduated from DigiPen and know the effort that is needed to graduate from there.\n\nSo, quite often, if a company has 1 DigiPen student they'll typically want more.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to ask more questions!",

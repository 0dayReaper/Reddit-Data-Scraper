I've read up a little and heard from seniors, but I'm having trouble coming to a decision with regards to which modules to take or which lecturers I should pick.\n\nThere are a few courses I'm pretty sure I'll take:\n\n1. GAT 251 (Bill Morrison or Christopher Orth)\n2. GAT 260 (Jami Lukins, Jennifer Ash or Russell Glaser)\n\nAnd some courses I'm on the fence about:\n\n1. CS 380 (Steve Rabin, whom I've heard is great)\n2. ENG 116 (Matt Muth, whom I've also heard is great)\n3. ART 310 (Lisa Meighan)\n4. CG 125 (Mark Nelson)\n5. CS 251 (Gary Herron)\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any noteworthy teachers or courses to go for/avoid?",

            "comment": "CG125 is a very chill, easy class. As the other guy said, there's an understanding that it's not going to push you very far or hard, so if you like the sound of that, it's great. On top of the low actual difficulty of the class, Nelson is a great teacher, which makes it feel even easier.\n\nCS380 depends a lot on what you want to get out of it. Rabin will tell you the lectures are the main value of the class, and I quite enjoyed them, so if you like lectures it's cool. Unfortunately, the assignments are pretty meh. There's a lot of neat stuff you can do for extra credit if you want to really push yourself, but just doing what you need to do for 100% is eh. Rabin is also quite draconic, which can get on your nerves if you're the kind of person that rubs the wrong way.\n\n260 and 251 are both solid but nothing terribly special. I would go out of your way to take the section with Orth, though. Nothing against Morrison, whom I like, but opinions on him vary, while Orth is pretty much universally liked.\n\nHaven't taken 310 yet, but my friends in it don't seem to be too fond of it, so I'd avoid it.",

I am choosing between this and ENG116 since they clash, but having one or two easier courses in a 6-course semester would be great.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, the assignments are pretty meh.\n\nWhen you say meh, do you mean they're rote/uninteresting?\n\n&gt; I would go out of your way to take the section with Orth, though.\n\nThanks for the tip-off! I'll see if I work my schedule around his class. \n\nHow are the classes like for GAT 251 anyway? GAT 250 here so far has been fairly structured with the a few lecture or brainstorming lessons, one playtest and a submission, but discussions are mostly contained within the teams.",

It's just a Maya class, but with the understanding that DigiPen is crazy and most non-BFAs aren't going to spend a lot of time on it. If you really are interested in 3D modeling, an actual BFA course might suit you better, although it would be much harder.",

Most of us will be taking 6 modules so having an easy class here and there is a relief. \n\nHow are the classes like though, is it very focused and heavy-handed with lecturing? Or is a lot of the time just exploring/learning the tools and working on assignments?",

Nelson will walk through the process in Maya on the projector while explaining what he's doing. He's usually very good at making sure everyone is caught up and is very easy to talk to, but if you stop paying attention while he's showing the example, it's easy to get lost. Thankfully, he's always more than willing to help once he finishes lecturing and gives us time to work on our own.",

            "comment": "&gt; 1.) What are your favorite parts of being/having been at DigiPen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe people are the best. You'll find it's very easy to make friends, even if you were the shy kid in high school. Everyone is really accepting of a lot of stuff, a lot of LGBTQ stuff on campus, etc. The best thing I can compare it to is it's like you're at a convention 24/7 whenever you're at the school, which is both really good and really bad. Sometimes, you just don't want to talk about video games every single hour of every single day, yknow? And I love video games! But cmon, can't we talk about like politics, or your day, or anything else...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 2.) What are some things you dislike about attending/having been to DigiPen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elitism here is off the charts. Not from the students, but from the school itself. Teachers say that \"if you can't make it here, you can't make it anywhere\", that their CS department is the best out there for gaming, that they're such a \"unique\" school, and that's why you're paying 30k per year in tuition alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workload is infuriating. You gotta have really good time management, and be willing to give your life to DigiPen if you wanna make it here. Hence, the huge drop out rate freshman year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the teachers are annoying, and some of them are not fit for the job. Of course, that's with any school though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that really infuriates me is how DigiPen sells itself on how it's such a \"unique school\" becuase \"wow guys, you're making games 24/7 IN SCHOOL! How awesome is that?\" but it's nothing you couldn't do with your local college's CS department and a couple of buddies. Hell, I'd probably recommend that, because it allows for more freedom in what you do, as well as saving a buttfuck ton of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 3.) What is the greatest challenge of attending DigiPen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou gotta give your life to it. You either make it or you don't. Simple as that. Unfortunately, I wasn't one of the students who made it, and I'm dropping out after my first semester. This is moreso due to money and change of interests (going into TV/Film now), but the school has a really toxic mentality in my opinion. If you fall behind even an inch, you HAVE to make up somehow, otherwise you're gonna go behind really easily. We cover stuff in CS 120 in the second week that my friend is just only getting to in his FINAL week in the semester at his CS department. And it's a good one too! Like top 50 in the US! You have to stay on that train no matter what, and it feels like there is no time for rest, and it takes a toll on your mental health drastically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 4.) How has being at DigiPen benefited you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I got MAD time management skills now. DigiPen will harden you to the core, even after a single semester. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 5.) Is/was it fun to attend DigiPen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepends. I found the GAT analysis stuff REALLY interesting, analyzing all of these small details in games and really thinking about the core of what a game is (hence the switch into a similar field like film), whereas programming was not only really hard for me, but also really boring. The people were fun as hell to hang out with. But ultimately, no. I didn't have fun. I think the expectations they put on students is harsh and too accelerated. I was constantly working hard for little results in programming. They say you don't need experience, but I guarantee you, you should have at least some solid foundations of programming. The environment was too taxing on me, and thus I left to have a more \"traditional\" education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 6.) How is the workload at DigiPen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsane. They ease you into it, and then suddenly you're working pretty much a full time job on just homework alone. It's a huge problem that has been discussed and slowly changing at the school, with the workload being so insane, but I don't think it's gonna change at all. I have 20 credit hours in my first semester, all required, and while that's probably on the larger side, every degree has to work their asses off just to get by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 7.) What do/did you major in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS in Computer Science and Game Design, which is mostly programming with a couple of design courses in it. One of the newer ones if I remember correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n &gt; 8.) How does DigiPen prepare students to be ready for the industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll give DigiPen this; it WILL prepare you. You are pretty much guaranteed a job, either in the industry or just in general CS stuff, if you just graduate. It's one of the few schools where the name holds weight. They have internship fairs, and companies will frequently come around the school, including big shots like Bethesda, Blizzard, etc. where upperclassmen can network with them, hand them their resumes, etc. It WILL prepare you for a career in the industry. No doubt about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 9.) Who are your role model(s)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy parents. They teach me to do what I love, and don't stop running from that goal, as well as work hard to achieve that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 10.) If you can change one thing about DigiPen, what would it be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost. I don't know where all that money is going (30K tuition, around 8k housing, and around x ammount for other personal stuff per year), cause it's definitely not going towards getting a bigger building (which they are having problems with now) or other improvements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm probably having a bit of a bias. I'm trying to be neutral, but I am dropping out, and I find more cons in the school than pros. I know you're not asking for if you wanna go to the school or not, but I would recommend not to. DigiPen might have been cool in the 90s or 00s when it was a new concept for a video game education, but nowadays, every other CS department has some sort of video game track, and hell, you can just make friends and make games with them at your state college in order to achieve the same thing. DigiPen forces you into a work camp, whether you like it or not. Nowadays, I can't recommend it to anyone, unless you like throwing away money. If you go to a state college, get a similar degree, and just work hard, you'll achieve the same thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigiPen is for the mad scientist. If you are 110% sure, I'd still caution you against it, but sure, it's worth it for the connections. If you have ANY doubts, DO NOT go to the school. I was 99% sure, and that 1% was enough for me to eventually drop out.",

I graduated, but the loan payments are killer.\n\nAlso, there are plenty of schools outside of DigiPen that offer the same degrees now.\n\nUSC and University of Utah both offer game developer degrees and both programs are above or around the same rank as the DigiPen degrees in the Princeton review.\n\nGood luck with you transition to TV/film!",

                            "comment": "Yep, I looked into practically every single video game centered school out there, with similar degrees. Hell, there was even one in my home state for a pretty cheap cost (like, 8k tuition per year) that while fairly new, still had some results, and I thought \"Nah, I gotta go for the BEST of the BEST right?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty jaded about the school. I feel like you can achieve the same effect of getting into the industry at a slower pace, and without shattering your mental health. DigiPen gets you there fast, no doubt about that, but at what cost? I was thinking about all these various degrees I could get, and applied to a shit ton of colleges, and I kind of freaked out and said \"well what do I know best\" and well, video games it was. I still think I could do DigiPen, but it's just too fast paced and too toxic of a place to be in, I knew I couldn't stay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI still wanna get into the industry, but for now, I'm just gonna take a more general track, and keep my options open, while also saving some money at my state college back home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the blessings! I'm pretty sure I'll do great, but you never know I guess. At least with this school, I can transfer to another degree fairly easily.",

            "comment": "&gt; 1.) What are your favorite parts of being/having been at DigiPen?\n\nThe people are generally pretty good and helpful. If you have issues with things there's always folks to answer questions and take a look at what you're working on.\n\n&gt; 2.) What are some things you dislike about attending/having been to DigiPen?\n\nPeople run around a lot, which is really annoying considering we have assigned open workspaces. That being said, I'm a loud salty dude, so I'm sure people don't love hearing me. \n\nThere are signifigant challenges working with people in BFA programs when doing custom engine work. But that's not anyones fault really. It's a rock and a hard place situation. It's just frustrating so I figured I'd mention it.\n\nWe're not great about producing open source code. I'm trying to change that, but alas it's taking more time than I'd like. I've been harping on it for near on 5 years now.\n\n&gt; 3.) What is the greatest challenge of attending DigiPen?\n\nThe workload, the stress, sometimes the output they expect out of people is too much. Not impossible levels of work, but more then is perhaps appropriate.\n\n&gt; 4.) How has being at DigiPen benefited you?\n\nDigiPen has taught me to program, and how to learn programming concepts. It's put me into contact with good friends, and given me the ability to make the right connections to land a good starting position after school.\n\n&gt; 5.) Is/was it fun to attend DigiPen?\n\nNo.\n\nHave I had fun while here? Of course, but DigiPen as a construct is a difficult, depressing hole of a place. The only thing keeping me going is the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n&gt; 6.) How is the workload at DigiPen?\n\nIt varies from class to class, but in general more than you want. My leisure time has dropped signifigantly from when I was working before DigiPen, and even the time I do have to myself feels more stressful and less relaxed. There are mitigations, but I'm just not as diligent as other people I suppose.\n\n&gt; 7.) What do/did you major in?\n\nStarted as BS in Computer Science in Real Time Interactive Simulation, ended up switching to BS in Computer Science when it was added, as I think the graphics curiculum needs some tuning up. That said, the general CS stuff added for BSCS isn't stellar either, so it's a toss up.\n\n&gt; 8.) How does DigiPen prepare students to be ready for the industry?\n\nOur the lectures in our project classes, which we take 8 semesters of, are often geared towards work related topics. Plus the fact that yeah, we're doing 8 semesters worth of team projects. You get used to working with people.\n\nOur student affairs folks have wonderful workers bringing in companies and helping students get jobs and internships.\n\n&gt; 9.) Who are your role model(s)?\n\nStephanie Hurlburt, she's the co-owner of a small, though successful, startup working on texture compression. While I have mixed feelings on the startup/indie life, she seems to be quite happy.\n\n&gt; 10.) If you can change one thing about DigiPen, what would it be?\n\nThere are dozens of issues with DigiPen, but I'll choose only one. The biggest I think would be Regional Accredidation. It requires the way DigiPen is run to be changed signifigantly. We would have a board that isn't associated with the owners of the school among other things. This is something that is being worked on, but unfortunately hasn't happened yet.\n",

            "comment": "Hey! Current Sophomore at DigiPen in the Computer Science and Digital Audio degree, and I'd love to answer your questions.\n\n1. There is a lot a love about DigiPen but I'll try and sum it up to only a few points.\n  \n*  Our Faculty - DigiPen's Professors are absolutely fantastic, not only are they phenomenal teachers a lot of them are also industry professionals. For example, I took a course last semester taught by Brian Schmidt,  who among other things, is the creator of the Xbox's audio subsystem!\n\n*  The workload - DigiPen is difficult; It is a ridiculous amount of work, and sometimes it's overwhelming but Its unbelievably noticeable to see how well it's preparing me for the games industry and how it's forced me to mature and become an adult much faster then other colleges would have. \n\n* The community - DigiPen's community is outstanding and unlike anything else. Everyone here has similar goals, and nearly all of us are super kind and love helping each other out. I've discovered a surprisingly neat way to sum this point up is the sentence - \"DigiPen is the kind of place where even the bus driver knows my name\"\n\n2. Honestly, I don't have a real answer to this. If I had to say anything - it's that while possible, it's a bit difficult to socialize with people outside of DigiPen. Both due to the lack of time, and Redmond being such a corporate place there aren't a lot of places to just hang.\n\n3. I touched on it above, but it's definitely balancing the workload. It's rather easy to procrastinate on an assignment just a tad bit too long and have everything crumble underneath you. The greatest challenge at DigiPen is completely mastering time management IMHO.\n\n4. The amount of material I've learned in just about 3 semesters is ridiculous. I genuinely consider myself a game developer, and have the skills to back it up. As I mentioned in Q1 - I've matured here faster then I would have at any other college. It's heavy work load requires you to understand the definition of prioritizing responsibilities, and due to it's lack of dorms (it has off campus apartments you can rent through DigiPen, but primarily freshman use it due to it's expense and other things) I've learned to understand how to actually live independent of my parents. I have to pay rent and utilities on time, and I have to ensure my roommates do as well. \n\n5. I couldn't imagine myself at any other place. DigiPen has easily been the best time of my life. Being surrounded by the people that care about the same things I do and aren't (for lack of better words), just fucking around is a great experience. It's quite literally, my version of Hogwarts.\n\n6. As discussed above, the workload is intense. Throughout the three semesters I have taken here at DigiPen, I have yet to have a semester below 20 credits. Comparatively, most colleges don't let students take about 18, and even at 18 your probably double majoring. \nThis semester, I am quite literally in class each week for a total of 24ish hours, and have a total of about 60+ hours of work a week, and that's probably a low estimate. I have an extremely light semester next term at 16 credits and the fact that 16 credits is considered \"extremely light\" blows people away.  \n\n7. Computer Science and Digital Audio - it's a full blown computer science degree, but with a concentration in audio programming. \n\n8. I believe this has been answered by the above questions, but just to repeat myself, it's through the course material taught, the professors who teach it, and the workload given and particularly our GAM course. The games industry is an extremely challenging industry and DigiPen ensures we are prepared by making sure we not only know Computer Science, but we know how to make games. Every semester, you are taking a GAM course in which you are required to create an actual game that's polished and critiqued by actual industry vets.\n\n9. I don't necessarily have a specific individual I'd consider my role model. I just try and aim to be the best person I can be.\n\n10. Our Bachelor of Arts in Game Design program doesn't teach students programming until the second year and I think that's absolutely ridiculous and personally advocate anyone taking that program to just take CS courses ahead of sequence.\n\nHope that answers everything! If you have any other questions just let me know!\n\n",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm Michael, a current BSGD.\n\n1) Digipen has a lot of moments where you're just like \"Wait, this is actually happening?\". This happens a lot, whether it's your professors telling you about their industry experience (most of them have pretty badass stories to tell), actual Game Designers from Blizzard visiting and answering your questions, or you working on a killer game, Digipen never ceases to surprise you. I'm very thankful for all the opportunities and stuff, and I'm sure everyone else is too.\n\n2) Since it is such a specialized school, the small community can get a little suffocating sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love a lot of the people, and I'm very grateful to be able to say that I have made some very good friends there. However, since basically everybody loves video games, it can begin to feel... just different than what you would expect college to be like. This is also kind of amplified by the fact that we don't really have a campus per se, or sports teams to go watch (if that's your cup of tea), or many schoolwide parties or what not (LAN party is lit af tho).\n\n3) Personally, I grew up traveling around the world a lot, so it's just been culture shock with moving back to the USA (I'm a citizen), but I get that's just a me thing.\n\n4) In high school, I was always kind just skimming by, as nothing really interested me and I felt like I could get good grades without too much effort. But Digipen really benefits me because I am finally studying something I love. Related to my first answer, I can't believe the experience I am getting, and I am such a better programmer/designer than I ever was before.\n\n5) It can start to feel like all you do there is work and play video games, and that can become boring. But if you are willing to put yourself out there, there is plenty of fun to be had with your friends in the Greater Seattle Area. I went to a boarding school in high school so there were events literally every week (plus I lived with 20+ guys), so my judgement might be a little skewed on this one.\n\n6) Hehe... It's pretty heavy. But if you're a generally responsible person, and you can manage your time well, you'll be just fine. I generally do most of my work on campus and then go home to relax.\n\n7) Bachelor of Computer Science and Game Design.\n\n8) Hmm... I mean I'm just a Freshman so I can't really answer this one, but the fact that we actually work on Game Teams and have to give professional level presentations is a really big help. There's also Company Days, where game studios will come to visit us and just talk about what it's like to work for them.\n\n9) Hideo Kojima in a sense, but I don't know anything about him personally obviously. I just really like his games and their direction.\n\n10) I'd say get a more regular campus but again we are a school of around 1000 students so I don't see how that would actually work out. I guess it does take a while to get feedback on some assignments, it'd be nicer if that was quicker.",

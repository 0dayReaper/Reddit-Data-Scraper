            "comment": "I can't really speak to the program at DigiPen. I was there when it was started but didn't really see many of the students going into it or had a chance to interact with them.\n\nBut, one thing I will say is that the footprint for sound designers is even smaller than regular designers.\n\nI'm working at a 50 person studio right now and we have a total of 2 sound designers and about 15 other designers. I worked at a AAA studio previously that was around 300 people(at that location) and they had maybe 15 sound designers.\n\nIt's a super small percentage so if you're super determined to get into the game industry as a sound designer be prepared to work your ass off.\n\nFor the cost I'd say it's probably not worth it. I left DigiPen with around $130,000 in loans, potentially more and I'm still paying them off. Been out since 2012. It also really sucks to pay $1000+ to student loans per month as well.\n\nSpecifically for sound design I'm betting there are better ways of getting into the industry than DigiPen as well. The program has probably only seen a couple of cohorts graduate. If you haven't yet I'd definitely ask them about the number of alumni from that degree that have actually gotten a job in a profession that matches to the degree.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions. I'm doubtful someone from either of the sound degrees will reply here but I could be wrong. It's rare for BFA to reply so I assume the sound degrees may be the same. Typically you only have RTIS ,BSGD, BAGD alumni or students on here.",

It took a lot of work and dedication, and DigiPen provided the environment that I needed to succeed. \n\nThe tuition is a lot, no way around it. The [GameSoundCon industry survey](https://www.gamesoundcon.com/post/game-audio-industry-survey-2021) is a good resource to know what kind of salary you can expect as a game sound designer. Whether it\u2019s worth it is up to you. \n\nIf you want guaranteed income, become an accountant. If you can\u2019t see yourself doing anything else, then you have to put in a lot of work to succeed. It\u2019s a difficult school and a difficult industry.",

            "comment": "With sound design, it's like a lot of other really competitive fields - even if you go to a good school for say, theater or dance and do well, your chances of making it are pretty low.\n\nSo, 'worth it' really depends on your perspective and how much money matter. \n\nIf you want the best possible shot at it, are OK with maybe not making it into the industry, and have the money to spend, then yeah it's worth it. \n\nIf you really want to find a job in your degree's field, and are worried about cost of degree and future wages, then it's probably not worth it.",

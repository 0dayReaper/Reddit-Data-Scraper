    "postText": "Since I am looking to attend DigiPen this upcoming fall semester (*praying for acceptance letter*), I am trying to plan for all the expenses. The DigiPen site offers some information; \"Room and board: $11,350.\"\n\nI was wanting to break it down a bit more. How much does one spend on food? How much of that is at Bits &amp; Bytes vs. local food? Any advice for saving money in this regard?",

I have heard Trailwood is one that people have liked, there are definitely others though.\n\nSo the cost of a 3 bedroom there is between $1800 and $2000 that seems a bit high, but then again it's Redmond.\n\nAnywho, if you divide that by 3(you and 2 other roommates, you'll most likely need them to live in Redmond) you'll get ~$630 (1900/3).\n\nSo, take that and multiply by 15 and you'll get the rough cost of a semester ($9450). Now, (11,350 - 9450)/15 = ~$126 per week for everything else including food.\n\nSo you're probably looking at somewhere around $90 a week for food.\n\nOf course, you'll want to have wiggle room since you'll also have to consider the time it takes for the loans to disburse and whatnot.\n\nHopefully this helps.\n\nAlways cheaper options as well. Particularly in apartments(there are a couple around DigiPen) though it might increase your travel time.\n\nEDIT: Correcting things.",

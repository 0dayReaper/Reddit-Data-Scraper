            "comment": "  So I'm a current Freshman BAGD and while I'm not as experienced with Digipen as some of the older students, I might be able to share some of my experiences and observations.\n\n  First and foremost, while it's great that you have started thinking about games and have made some yourself, it's best to leave your ego at the door here. As /u/ThePIateau said, there are a lot of freshman who act arrogant simply because they think they know more about game design than anyone else. With how important game teams are, it's best to be on everyone's good sides, as your peers are going to be the ones who decide whether or not they want to be on the same team as you.\n\n\n  I'm not trying to call you arrogant, it's great that you're thinking about games and how they're made right now, but it's unfortunate to see the people who got on others' nerves. Now that everyone is scrambling to form game teams for next year, a lot of those people are left without teams who want them.\n\n\nAs for which degree program to pursue, I tentatively recommend the BAGD program. I say tentatively because I actually started this semester as a BSCSGD, and I don't regret a second of it at all. This is because I had to take CS120, which is an introductory class to the C coding language. I'm currently taking CS175, which is a C++ coding language class. This has been a huge advantage for me over other Freshman BAGDs, as most of them are not required to take a coding class until around their 3rd semester (I think). Having the ability to code, and code well at that, makes you far more valuable to prospective teams, as you will theoretically be able to implement the design ideas you come up with into your game. \n\n\nEven if you don't want to worry too much about the programming aspect of games, I suggest starting as a BAGD, but try to take CS120 in your first semester. That way, you'll get the same level of programming as first semester BSCSGDs without needing to take the computer engineering classes they'll have to take.\n\nAs for the final, *\"bonus\"* answer, I'd advise you not to worry about that sort of thing at all if you're coming to Digipen. Most of the people I've met who are single here are either too busy to deal with relationships, not interested, not into guys, or any combination of the above. Again, try to not come to Digipen for just that. Digipen's cost isn't anything to scoff at. From what I can tell, parties aren't that often here, because again, everyone is too busy for that, so getting laid at a wild college party isn't likely either. \n\nWhile I may not be the most knowledgeable person here, I'd be down to answer anything else you've got for me.\n",

            "comment": "Your GPA will help you but your SAT is probably will not. DigiPen is a lot of work, most people's GPA tanks here compared to high school or even other colleges. If your GPA falls too low, you will likely lose scholarships. You know your work ethic better than I do, so whether or not you are likely to keep scholarships is something for you to consider. You can get scholarships to cover 100% if you are willing to put in the time and effort to apply for enough of them. You can also try to get an RA position, which includes free housing and a food stipend that covers some of your living expenses.\n\nI have no idea how accurate the Princeton review is, as I haven't attended any of the other schools. Many of the game designers I know are quite capable, but the most valuable skill you can have as a game designer is to be able to take criticism in any form gracefully. Recently DigiPen games have been going to competition less because of the prevalence of off the shelf game engines (Unity, Unreal, game maker studio, etc.) at other schools while many DigiPen games are in engines we build, combined with students at other schools often spending longer on their projects. I don't think this really says anything about the schools, it's just an ideological difference and the ideology at DigiPen IMO lends itself better to learning programming and not as well to making competition ready games while in school.\n\nAs a social outcast who loves games, you have a high likelihood of fitting in, but if you lack humility you will not make many friends and your projects will likely suffer because people quickly learn that the most valuable skill you can bring to a team is playing well with others and nobody wants to work with an arrogant know-it-all.\n\nI highly suggest coming to the school and just talking to a bunch of students to ask about their experience, and drawing your conclusions from that.\n\nCareer advice for you: It is much easier to get a job as a programmer than as a designer, and programmers get paid a lot more. If you work for someone else's company, you will almost always be making someone else's world instead of creating your own. To do that you have to go indie, which is generally not paid well and very unlikely to succeed. You hear about the wild breakout success stories, but not the much more common story of people who make many games before seeing anything that could be considered financial success. ",

            "comment": "Current Sophomore BSCSGD (usually shortened to BSGD) here.\n\nYour goal is confusing, you want to create worlds yourself or for companies that will pay $$$? Because going indie is something people do but I wouldn't personally recommend.\n\nAs far as I know they don't really look at your portfolio for the merit based scholarship. Solely on what you get on your SAT and GPA.\n\nThe school imo is misrepresented in the Princeton Review. Ive never seen them around or how they get their information but in my personal opinion DigiPen is one of is not the best game design school out there. The only thing I would critique about the design is that there is only so much they can teach you before you have to apply yourself.\n\nYou're already doing well by creating games, all I have to say about that is get feedback on them and do constant iteration over it. If you're interested in the BAGD then I would also suggest getting to know scripting languages (which you seem to know a bit about). Also to comment on that degree, from my understanding, the degree is as much as you make it. If you apply yourself and try your best to get what you want out if the program you will do well. If you are unsure and just take classes and that's it, things don't look too good.\n\nIf you're a social outcast, then you will be more than welcome here. But PLEASE BE HUMBLE. There are many gamedevs that come through the school as freshman that are really boastful and are cocky and nobody really likes working with them. The school is very much like the game industry, if you're a dick to people, people will remember that.\n\nBonus answer:\n(If you are straight) - the girls here are cool and a lot of them are gamers. If you're suave and cool then it shouldn't be a problem. But please don't make a fool of yourself, and remember what I said, don't try and get yourself remembered as that guy.\n\n(If you are bi/gay) - there are a fair amount of them here (including myself). I make it a personal moral of mine to not date Digipen students, but all of them here are super cool. \n\n(In general) - just don't be super awkward and you'll be good. But please don't come to the school for that or actively try and do that. There already are enough of those here...\n\nMessage me if you have any more questions, I'm part of a lot of clubs and am part of Senate so I know a lot about how this school runs. Good luck!",

                            "comment": "Yo, graduating BSGD.\n\nThe BSGD degree is currently being reworked. It isn't super-viable to be a true hybrid. There just aren't that many positions that require both a strong CS and design background. Most positions I've been applying to have been either CS, OR design. That being said, I just (today) received two offers from two companies that I would very much like to work for, both in hybrid roles (I'm pretty hyped). \n\nI would say that the CS skills offered from the BSGD program are nice because: \n1) Job security. I can viably apply to 2x as many positions as most people. It's nice to be confident when applying to both engineering and design positions.\n2) True hybridization. There are a few roles (Rockstar's AI Code Content Developer, Technical Designer at many studios, etc.) that require true hybridization of design and CS. If this is something you really want to go for, then BSGD is the way to go.\n3) Understanding. It has been a long time since I've felt completely lost in a design/CS conversation. Having an understanding of a broad range of things is nice, and often valuable. It also comes through when communicating with teammates, when you legitimately empathize with the obstacles they encounter.\n\nYour portfolio? Honestly, having a 4.0 and a website at this point puts you ahead of the curve. No idea how that translate to scholarships. I'm too dumb to qualify for those, lol.\n\nHow accurate is Princeton? Don't know, as I don't go to the other school, haha. I'd say that DigiPen has good and bad aspects, but I've gained a lot of confidence during interviews. As a technical designer, I've gotten through all the rounds with Google and Amazon for engineering roles. Ultimately got rejected, but fucking nice on the self-esteem. DigiPen will burn you or make you good. If you can get through it with your chin held high, I'd be confident in your skills.\n\nSocial outcast? Hate to say it, but that's something you will want to work on. Communication is the most important skill there is, after basic competency. This is true especially for a designer, since designers need to be able to communicate with all disciplines. Introversion and shyness are fine (I have an abundance of both), but you need to be willing to step outside of your comfort zone. One thing I did a lot was talk to random people. Actual conversation. Ripped my guts out every time. Worked out surprisingly well. Book I'd recommend: How to Win Friends and Influence People. Feels awkward to read a book about socializing, but fuck it. \n\nVirginity? Kind of whatever. I'd practice on dating sites like OKCupid or Tinder. Don't plan on it, and don't try for it. It's a stereotype that DigiPen students are creepy and awkward, you don't want to perpetuate that stereotype. Communication is hard; I would hit on people outside of DigiPen. You don't want to accidentally burn bridges.",

And the C and C++ courses mean a lot to a designer imo. It means that I am able to work in a custom engine and be able to debug and work there. If you are trying to go indie then you should be knowledgeable of how custom engines work. There are a number of current BAGDs who are taking core CS classes because they believe they need to understand more on how computer languages work. Imo, I usually recommend BSGD if you are wanting to go indie so you can be competent in both programming and design parties. \n\nEDIT: Also, all BSGDs take nearly all of the BAGD GAT classes, so I feel competent enough to design (and program) a great game.",

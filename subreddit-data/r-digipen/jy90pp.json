    "postText": "Digipen, Singapore(heard that US and SG versions are similar)\n\nAs someone looking to become a game designer, I would like to be capable at both game design and programming. \n\nAs such, BS in computer science and game design seemed like something that will do both for me, until I heard that it focuses mainly on computer science and like throws the game design aspect into the wayside. At the same time, i worry that BA in game design will not teach enough programming skills to be able to create good, complex games, and that employers are looking for designers who can actually code(or do art which i fail at).\n\nSo, was wondering about these:\n\n1. How proficient at game design are BSCSGD students compared to BAGD students(estimation) and how much time do the students for the first spend learning game design compared to BAGD?\n\n2. Do students for BSCSGD struggle relative to BAGD students to find jobs in game design? \n\n3. How extensive are the game design electives/minors that BSCSGD students can take, and how extensive are the programming electives/minors that are available to BAGD students? Compared to industry needs. (For example, is BAGD combined with the electives/minors available to students able to make students capable enough to become a game programmer? Is BSCSGD combined with game design electives/minors able to make students capable enough to become a game designer?)\n\n4. Can I easily make my own indie game with skills taught in BAGD? The ones on steam etc.\n\nEven a rough guess based on your experiences is fine, really appreciate it :D\n\nWill i be capable enough to become a game programmer with the things i learn at BAGD? Will i be more than capable enough to be a game designer if i choose BSCSGD? \n\n\nI might choose BSCSGD if it can make me more than capable enough to be a game designer, because I would probably need alot of the programming skills taught there.\n\n\ntldr BSCSGD vs BAGD, looking to be a game designer, is BSCSGD able to help me do that more than BAGD?\n\nThanks alot, it's really important to me rn.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2016 as a BAGD and got a job in the industry after graduating. Things may have changed since then but I can try to answer.\n\n1. They both share a lot of classes but BAGDs specialize in game design and have a few more relevant but specialized classes in it, such as a puzzle design class, a table top game design class (systems design basically), but I believe game history, board game design, individual game projects and team game projects are shared between both and they are the most important. If you have electives you could take some of the extra classes that BAGD takes.\n\n2. There are so few people who graduate each year that it is very dependent on the individual, but in general I think BSCSGD are better off finding jobs. Jobs in game design specifically? Maybe not particularly.\n\n3. I basically took BAGD because I was bad at math and didn't like it much. There were only 2 or so math classes and they weren't that hard, but BSCSGD has a ton of math classes and you will probably be learning about game engine architecture whereas I only really learned gameplay scripting and the basics of making a game engine in a scripting language. Aside from the specialist classes I mentioned above, BAGDs have more english classes and at least one UI design class. At the time I was in school we had a special class that was just BAs making a game together without the other degrees because they wanted us to learn how to make the games ourselves without relying on programmers to do everything. Anyway, pretty sure you can take a lot of the extra BA design classes with your electives if you go BSCSGD.\n\n4. With unreal and unity, I would say yes definitely. They don't really teach you that much scripting/coding, but you will be making multiple games per semester all by yourself and there's no reason you can't scale that up with some determination. I don't recommend going to college to make indie games though. It's a career move and if you want to make indie games just take some programming classes and start doing that now. Even so, as a BAGD you will face limitations of your skill that will influence the design of the game, but if you are inclined to be a BAGD you can also do a lot of other things that BSCSGD perhaps wouldn't pick up, like making game UI, making nice particle effects, doing basic animation stuff to enhance game feel and ect.",

Good to know I can take more game design electives because the BSCSGD was starting to look lacking in that aspect, and even better that some of the most important aspects are also taught in BS\n\nDo you think what you learnt in BAGD can't be easily learnt anywhere else(for the important aspects of it) and do you think BAGD continually pushed you and was hard or is the coursework just fine?\n\nThanks for this!",

It's a matter of dedication, knowing where to look, enjoying what you do and following through with the right steps to learn it (playtesting, analyzing player feedback, iterating on your analysis) and you have to do it to learn it, not just sit in the classes.\n\nEven if you take BSCSGD, you will have access to the professors that teach game design and the other BAGD students who eternally need people to test their games, so you can probably find some BAGD who need testers and get them to help you analyze your own designs, or at least see what they are up to and emulate it on some scale.",

            "comment": "Current BSGD Y3 here, starting a game design internship within a few months.\n\nFor reference, the [2019 GES is now available](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/uploads/Web-Publication-SIT-GES-2019.pdf). While you should take these statistics with a pinch of salt because of how the survey is fundamentally done, BSGD fares an approximate 8% higher in terms of employment rate, and with a much higher median salary of $3,800 over BAGD's $3,120. Even at the 25th and 75th percentile, the difference in pay is about $500. While everyone aims to achieve their dream job, it's important to also consider your (other) life goals.\n\nStats aside:\n\n&gt;How proficient at game design are BSCSGD students compared to BAGD students(estimation) and how much time do the students for the first spend learning game design compared to BAGD? \n\nLike others have mentioned in this thread, BSGDs share many design classes with BAGDs. I would generally say that while the design courses do introduce concepts and content, it is largely dependent on the individual's curiosity and willingness to explore these concepts. I've seen many project teams with no BAGDs deliver games on an equal design level as teams with BAGDs, so my honest opinion is that it's still up to the individual. BAGDs just get a little more exposure to different topics and are allocated more time for experimentation in this field.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Do students for BSCSGD struggle relative to BAGD students to find jobs in game design? \n\nNo, for the reasons listed above. BSGDs have the upper hand when it comes to the variety of jobs because they have CS background as well, which may come useful when prototyping and laying out levels. Also, I got a good internship offer for a game design position ahead of my BAGD peers. So in the end it depends on the individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How extensive are the game design electives/minors that BSCSGD students can take, and how extensive are the programming electives/minors that are available to BAGD students? Compared to industry needs. (For example, is BAGD combined with the electives/minors available to students able to make students capable enough to become a game programmer? Is BSCSGD combined with game design electives/minors able to make students capable enough to become a game designer?) \n\n2020 cohort onwards, digipen no longer offers BSGD and BAGD tracks. Instead, they offer IMGD and UXGD tracks. IMGD is the rebranded BSGD but as a collaboration with SIT, and it **does not allow you to pick electives**. UXGD is the rebranded BAGD and currently still offer electives. The UXGD track does not offer a decent path for a designer to transition to a gameplay programmer; if you're looking for a potential role as any sort of programmer, I'd highly suggest you to apply for IMGD instead - the discrepancy of coding skill level is too great between BSc and BA disciplines. IMGD, however, offers a more balanced approach to both CS and GD, so BSGDs are generally more versatile when it comes to jobs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Can I easily make my own indie game with skills taught in BAGD? The ones on steam etc. \n\nYou can already do this without enrolling to any course at all. Having the discipline to follow through tutorials, approach community discord servers such as [SGGA](https://discord.gg/Y7sp3TJf) for feedback will already be more then enough. Digipen provides you with an environment to hone your skills, not a secret formula to make the next Binding of Isaac.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Will i be capable enough to become a game programmer with the things i learn at BAGD? Will i be more than capable enough to be a game designer if i choose BSCSGD? \n\nWhile it isn't impossible to become either regardless of whichever you pick, I strongly recommend you to choose BSGD over BAGD if you want to have the option to choose between a game programmer or a game designer role when you're done with your studies. BAGD is a deep specialization into a designer role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; tldr BSCSGD vs BAGD, looking to be a game designer, is BSCSGD able to help me do that more than BAGD? \n\nMany of my acquaintances in both BSGD and BAGD concur that while BAGD gives you a better shot at securing a design role in the future, BSGD opens up more options and are more versatile when it comes to any role in game development and job opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps; feel free to ask anything else :)",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm looking to apply to the mscs program. I have 3 years of web and mobile dev under my belt and have a couple of months worth of scripting experience on unity and unreal.\n\nI will be an international applicant and I have scored a 305 in GRE (Q:159, V:146) and 99 in TOEFL (24, 23, 26, 26).\n\nI'm not sure what sort of portfolio the admission committee looks for, but I have one game prototype that I can show. It's a game that I've made with 2 other people (an artist and a designer). I've done the scripting and sound effects. I'm quite determined to do the shift from programming software to games as I just don't enjoy software anymore! \n\nAnything I should know or do before sending in my applications? I'm currently waiting for my college professors to respond to my letter of recommendation requests (haven't been in touch with them since I graduated about 4 years ago). \n\nThanks!\n\n\nEdit: I have a bachelors degree in computer science and 3 years of programming professionally. So I'm not worried about not being able to catch-up with the programming concepts. I'm considering this course to learn and apply that to Game Dev. ",

I'm a current Master's student - I think you could do just fine.  5 years of C/C++ is absolutely not required.  You learn C and C++ in your first class as a Master's student and it is introductory.  It's not introductory for programming in general, but it introduces you to the language.  If you can program well, you can do it.",

You don't even learn about what STL containers ARE until late into the first class, let alone needing to write your own.",

As someone who learned C/C++ first then scripting and web development, I can say first hand, C/C++/Assembly is a different world entirely. The masters program is essentially a 4-5 year degree crammed into 3 years. There is no room for failure or falling behind once you start. Everything that u/alphabetstew said is true and important, the school is hard, and I've seen university BSCS graduates fail out of the masters program at DigiPen. It doesn't happen often, but most masters students dedicate 100% of their time to the strictly structured and scheduled program and come in with 5+ years of C/C++ experience.",

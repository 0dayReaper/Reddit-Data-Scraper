    "postText": "Hey, this post is for students who are in the bfa of digital arts and animation. I want to do the program, but what is it like? What do you start out with? Is it difficult? ((Well it is college, so I know it would be Yes, but is it more stressful and over powering)) What do you start with? I'm really confused and nervous about applying, cause of the expensives and my parents hating this school. More info would be helpful for an informed decision.",

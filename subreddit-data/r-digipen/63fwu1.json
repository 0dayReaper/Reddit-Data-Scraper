            "comment": "A 3.15 is not low by ANY standards. I know people who got in with a 2.5 or lower. \n\n\nThe following is what I've noticed, and by no means actually what is true: \nMy biggest recommendation is to make sure your college letter is kickass. That's what they are looking for above almost anything else. Generally speaking, a large number of students here weren't the best high school students. We all fell into the similar situation of not being challenged enough, or just not enjoying what we were learning in high school so we didn't put in the effort to get high GPAs. However, when we find something we really like, we put every ounce of effort into it and make sure we master it. \n\nDigiPen acknowledges this, so instead of looking just for high GPA students, it looks for students with passion. It looks to see if you really want to be here, and if you really want to be a game developer / artist. If you don't have that passion, your GPA doesn't matter. \n\n\nTL;DR. 3.15 is more than fine. Write a kickass essay, make sure you convince the admissions office that this is where you want to be.",

I got in with a 2.5 GPA, but I also had high SAT scores, finished an associates degree at community college with straight A's the last year I was there, and wrote a kickass essay.\n\nGPA counts for a lot less when you can prove that you get shit done and know how to do quality work when you put your mind to it.\n\n",

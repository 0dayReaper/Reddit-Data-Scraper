            "comment": "Hello, I guess it depends on how much programming you want to learn on your own. To build an effective game engine from scratch is not a simple thing to do and you learn how to do that at DigiPen when going through the RTIS program.\n\nI suppose I could go the opposite direction and say it depends on how much game design you want to learn on your own as well. I think with game design though you can kinda pick it up by playtesting your games with people and getting their feedback and acting on that feedback/building knowledge and experience from it.\n\nI would personally say the programming is what is going to get you the farthest especially if you're planning to roll your own game engine. So RTIS.\n\nI don't know if things have changed at DigiPen recently but when I attended you could have a game team built entirely out of RTIS students which means you could theoretically be the designer on your team but also be one of the programmers so you can at least get design experience in that way as well.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nMake sure you're capable of covering the cost of DigiPen though. It's extremely expensive and not conducive to going indie right out of the gate if you have student loans to worry about.",

            "comment": "I'll pretty much echo what the other person said. If what you want to do is things like physics and engine programming, RTIS is where it's at.\n\nAdditionally, graphics programming is very core to the RTIS program and you'll need that if you want to make engines. You'll also get things like AI, Algorithms, and Compilers, which are all useful.\n\nFor the game design side, you can pick up a decent amount from electives and game project, although you'll miss out on some of the rapid prototyping, play testing techniques, etc.\n\nAnd yeah, make sure you're ready for both the price, and the schedule. You'll be paying a lot of money to essentially give your life up for 4 years. But hey, if you make it, it's worth it. Best of luck.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a senior year high school student from Canada planning on applying to Digipen once my February or April transcripts come in. \n\nThere are a ton of posts here about the RTIS and BSGD degrees here, but I've yet to see much about the BSCE degree. My plan at the moment is to (if I get in) take the BSCE degree and minor in game design rather than take the BSGD degree or the RTIS Degree. While I'm definitely interested in programming, I'm more interested in and know more about design and hardware, but if programming isn't a large part of the degree, I'm not sure if I should do it. \n\nWould anyone who's in the BSCE degree be able voice their opinions on the degree, how it differs from the other BS degrees, and how much CS is included in the curriculum? \n\nAnd for those who are doing their term projects, how have BSCE students contributed to your teams? I would imagine that without a minor in art, CS, or design, and only studying hardware would put them behind considerably as team members where your main goal is to develop games rather than hardware. \n\nThanks.

            "comment": "Sophomore CE here, I'll answer some questions. First, while it is technically possible to minor in game design, I would highly suggest not doing that. The CE schedule is packed, and the game design minor is not going to help you on a resume if you are applying for a job in a CE related field. You could probably take a few GD classes as electives, but I just want to warn you that even if you want to minor in GD, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to actually complete that minor.\n\nSecondly, programming is a massive part of the CE curriculum. We take almost every CS class that the RTIS students take, except of course for the graphics, game implementation, AI, and other game exclusive CS classes. You also do quite a bit of programming in the CE classes, there is a lot of programming on embedded systems, and later on you get to code FPGAs. FPGAs are, to put it extremely simply, programmable circuit boards consisting of configurable logic gates, that are configured by code you write for them. Pretty cool stuff.\n\nWe very rarely work with game students on projects, mainly because they are loud and smell bad.\n\nWe are a pretty tight knit group, only around 20 of us, but knowing every other student in your degree, including all the upperclassmen, is a big advamtage, especially when you all work and hangout in the same room together most of the time. That is something most degrees here don't give you. Professors know you by name, they are easier to get help from compared to other professors, and the classes are much more hands on. I would recommend the CE program to anyone that is interested. If you have more questions feel free to PM me.",

From my (RTIS, trying to minor in ce) knowledge, the program is good. How good I couldn't say, probably not as good as other schools.\n\nI haven't taken any CE classes other than cs100, which every bs student is required to take.",

            "comment": "Why DigiPen? There are plenty of great schools to learn CE in, most of them much cheaper than DP. What are you looking for that you think you'll find here, specifically?\n\nIf it's for the game design minor, I would recommend against it. Speaking as a BSGD, game design classes are huge time sinks, and CE is already a tough degree, so trying to do both would be pretty brutal. Also, like one of the other replies said, finding a job that uses all three of design + programming + CE is going to be very hard if not impossible. Design + programming is feasible, as is programming + CE, but I'd limit yourself to one of those pairs.\n\nMost CE students aren't a part of the game teams, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. For example, there's an event called Alt.Ctrl.GDC, which is a yearly showcase of games with non-traditional control methods, and DigiPen teams can enter in it. I've only ever seen one team actually enter, though, (most find the added risk not worth it) and I'm not even sure that they had CE help in doing so.",

            "comment": "Hi guys, thanks for your responses. \n\nAfter reading your posts, I think I'm leaning more towards RTIS with a minor in GD over CE with a minor in GD because I want to work on game projects. I've heard some pretty questionable things about the BSGD degree, and the general consensus I've seen from the subreddit is to do RTIS w/ a minor in GD over BSGD. \n\nWould you guys be able to give your opinions on how those two options weigh currently? I know there have been some changes to the BSGD curriculum, and the threads talking about it are a bit old. What's changed about the BSGD, and how does it compare to RTIS w/ minor in GD at the moment? \n\nAlso, with regards to work load for either option, what's the free time to school work ratio like there? I know that a lot of people pour time into their game projects because they're passionate about them so there's a lot of variance depending on who you are, but as far as being able to do other stuff like maybe running a club, how much time would you be able to reliably dedicate to something like that? \n\nThe reason I'm asking is because I play SSB:Melee competitively, and with the school being in the states, and me having no intention of not competing while it's way easier to get to tournaments over there, how reasonable would it be to be able to run a club for Melee there and have time to travel to tournaments along with course work?

                    "comment": "BSGD Alumni here.\n\nFirst off, at least when I attended, there was a smash bros club at the school. I don't know which version of the game they played, but I want to say it was melee.\n\nI'd say you have more options in and outside of the game industry with an RTIS degree in general. Having a minor in GD is obviously up to you though, you could simply push to be the game designer on your game team and gain some design experience that way instead too.\n\nI think you'd be better served doing that rather than a GD minor simply because game studios usually care more about what you have done rather than what you graduated with. Of course the GD classes can be helpful in learning about design, more current design students can definitely give more info on that though.\n\nWorkload for me in the BSGD degree was pretty hectic. It usually ramped up somewhere around mid terms and didn't stop until the semester ended. When things did ramp up I was usually at the school from 9am to closing time for the school.\n\nThough, if you manage your time well you can definitely reduce that time frame. That also includes working on my game project which took up the bulk of my time. The trouble with design stuff is that it can always be better as well. There's always something to tweak.\n\nTraveling to tournaments might produce some problems, but you can obviously prepare to go to them and make sure whatever homework you need to get done is done before those tournaments.\n\nIt all depends on your time management skills and your proficiency in learning programming, math, and anything else you need to learn in your classes.\n\nI know quite a few RTIS students that are now designers.\n\nBut, I'll end with this. DigiPen is extremely expensive and if you plan to pay for DigiPen just through loans you might want to consider state schools that offer game development degrees where you can get considerably cheaper tuition when you become a resident of the state. Like USC, or University of Utah.\n\nI graduated from the BSGD degree with over $100,000 in student loans. I'm still paying them. It's been 4 years and it still sucks, heh. I'm doing what I enjoy though. Just keep this in mind. Consider all of your options.\n\nIf everything is paid for then more power to you.\n\nGood luck on your choice!\n\nFeel free to ask more questions.\n\nI'm sure others will chime in.",

I told myself going in I'd have time to learn game engine programming and game programming techniques in general on the side. Long story short, I didn't, at least not to my satisfaction (I did make some games and screw around with other engines / people's plain directX simulations), the CE curriculum was too packed. There's a reason CE is advertised as a 5 year program now.",

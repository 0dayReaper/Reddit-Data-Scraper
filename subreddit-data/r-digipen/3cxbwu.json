            "comment": "Essentially you can't sell the things that you make while you are on the DigiPen campus(Meaning DigiPen owns it forever). That's as far as I'm aware of it. Could be more inclusive than that though.\n\nThis does not stop you from re-making your game outside of DigiPen though and selling it. As long as you're not on the DigiPen campus and not using their hardware you \"should\" be fine... I think.\n\nFor an example of somebody(People from DigiPen) successfully remaking their game just look at four sided fantasy or Nitronic Rush (Now Distance).\n\nTheir reasoning for it is that you're in an educational environment and they would rather people working together instead of building up walls to hide their ideas from others so they can have an \"edge\" on their competition. Plus the legality of who actually worked on your project and who helped with it. Testers and whatnots.\n\nEDIT: Just grammar fixes",

Most if not all of the licenses you get through DigiPen will be student licenses which are not legally viable for professional development of a product anyway.\n\nThat's not to say that people don't use student licenses to create products that are sold, it's just that if you were ever caught you would get a fine and probably have other nasty things thrown at you.",

                                    "comment": "Actually, it was more accurate the first time. You can't use any DigiPen resources in something you want to sell. You can't be on campus while working on it, you can't use their software (Including MSDN software), and you can't ask people like professors for help on it. Extrapolate from the second sentence for more examples.\n\nIf you've already done the Docusign thing, that was the contract in which you agreed to this. This is honestly pretty typical, and it's not as bad as it sounds. In general, no one's so hardcore that you can't ask advice for something you're working on. You certainly should not use DigiPen software however. This policy is mostly in place to prevent GAM teams from screwing each other.",

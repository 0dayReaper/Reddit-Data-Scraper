I definitely know it will be challenging and am prepared for that but how would you say free time/social life/outside of school is?? Can anyone share their experiences? (with their field, and especially BAGD) Thank you!!",

            "comment": "BAGD feels like the easiest degree offered. Every degree loves to exaggerate how hard their work is, when in reality if you budget your time, it's very manageable. There are definitely plenty of opportunities to socialize, if you want to have an active social group, you can. My advice to help with this is to get started early, by utilizing the incoming students facebook group and other things before school actually starts.",

            "comment": "Speaking as a BSCSGD moving to BAGD this semester, the social life aspect isn't that bad. I live about an hour and a half away and although I live at the Summit apartment complex I go home to see my old friends about once a month.\n\nWhile a bunch of people at Digipen seem to leans slightly towards the introverted side, a lot of BAGDs seem to lean towards the extroverted side for whatever reason. The majority of the people I hang out with are BAGDs.\n\nFor a social life outside of school, I don't actually do that much. A lot of the time I spend with that friend group is simply at lunch when we all happen to have time off. Despite this, they as BAGDs talk all the time about meeting at one of their apartments to play various board games and chill together.\n\nI'm a freshman, so this may or may not be accurate to the other 3 years you'll spend here, but at least from my perspective Digipen won't consume your social life if you don't let it.",

            "comment": "It depends on how diligent you are with your time, how much/little you game, how easy it is for you to learn the concepts, how you handle the stress, and how much time you want to put into your projects. If you want to give up gaming entirely, you'll have a reasonable amount of free time. If you keep a strict schedule for everything and absorb the material quickly, you'll be fine. If you want to sacrifice a small sliver of quality of your game for relaxation, you're crazy, but it'll also help you survive.\n\nThe hard part about DigiPen is knowing you have such a limited amount of time to become the best you can be and still giving yourself time to breath.\n\n(I'm a BSESD/BSCSDA BTW)",

As everyone as been saying, your free time depends on your ability to get things done in a reasonable amount of time. If you can discipline yourself to do things as they are assigned and finish them days before they are due - you will have free time. \n\nHow you spend this time though, is important. Free time is, in my opinion a commodity and you should always be spending it on the right things.\n\nMy biggest warning for incoming BAGDs - Be Prepared to Write. A lot. \n\nFeel free to look at my website and blog for general information about my first semester at DigiPen: abrigante.com",

When you graduate, the industry knows at least one thing about you: you can handle the worst of situations that they will throw at you. Working 20 hour days for weeks on end is not uncommon, and there have been times when I've gone several days without sleeping.\nYes, you CAN get a CS degree from anywhere else and still make it in the industry. But being a DigiPen graduate carries a lot of heft to it as well.\nIf you're not interested in CS, and are thinking more towards the BAGD or BFA paths, then I might suggest looking at USC as well. They have a higher rated program, and have the resources of a fully funded college.\nAn unfortunate reality of DigiPen is that a lot of the people in other majors, particularly in the RTIS, tend to think that Designers aren't worth as much. By the time Junior year comes around, they start to realize that's not the case.",

                            "comment": "It's complicated and has a lot to do with perception. Before you ever come here people shape your perception of DigiPen as an elite school that will form you into the absolute best of what you do. And on top of that that it's exceptionally difficult.\n\nNow as you might expect, neither of those are entirely true. Our BFA program is not best in class, but it is good. It's a competitive program, but there are better ones out there, enough that it's worth mentioning. On the other hand, this program is actually quite demanding to my knowledge. Mostly due to an inordinate amount of workload, and in some cases unfair expectations.\n\nOur Game Design programs are in flux, and there's not really enough data on them to really say how well graduates do, but it seems to be middling. Game Design is a new field, and DigiPen approaches it from a sort of artistic \"do it to learn it\" approach. \n\nOur CE program is small, and difficulty is hard to ascertain but it's probably a bit more than RTIS. But they seem to do well afterwords.\n\nRTIS is the one that everyone really cares about. It's our premier degree, and the one people actually know (Although not by name, BSCSRTIS is a mouthful.) about when thinking about DigiPen. It's tough, but generally not because you're doing anything actually crazy hard or obtuse, more because it's a lot of stuff after the first two semesters, and you've got to manage your time well.\n\nThe recurring theme in all of our programs is that you have to manage your time well to succeed. After the first year, people who are awful at it have typically left (This is true for other schools as well, it's just a bit more dramatic and far more noticeable due to the way classes are structured.), and you have people who will screw up sometimes, but can generally make it through, either struggling to pass everything, or failing a class or two once in awhile. But the point is they get to the finish line.\n\nPeople begin to feel a lot of resentment towards DigiPen. They spend a majority of their time there, either taking classes, studying, doing homework, or working on their projects, and it doesn't feel like an environment of fun like the media portrays most college to be like. They want to go out, meet people of their preferred gender, and have fun. That sort of thing is highly discouraged at DigiPen though culture. If you're not working on your homework you'll fall behind, if you're not working on your game it'll suck. No one says that in so many words, but it's just the general vibe. And it's not entirely incorrect, you do have to manage your time well. It's not like there's no time to do stuff, but it's really easy to fall into browsing reddit for a few hours a day and it feeling like you have no free time. On top of that, we don't have a very diverse student body, so there's a sort of undercurrent of the males at DigiPen being really pissed off at not being able to date and such while they're here. And they don't feel as though they can easily meet people outside of the school because they're busy doing everything they can to pass. So if you see stuff relating to that, there's the gist. As you might imagine, it's not great for the female students either, but I don't have any particular insight there.\n\nAnyway I can't think of anything else to write off the top of my head, but feel free to ask me anything.",

I have a few friends in them, and they seem to be doing well. I'm always impressed with the work the BA guys seem to churn out, I remember when right before submission we got sound back from our guy and our game was suddenly much better for it. Obviously we plan to work more closely with our sound guys going forward. I've never had a BS Sound Design person on my team, so I can't comment directly about them, but I know that they're essentially RTIS but for sound, which at least tells me on paper that they're solid programmers. Obviously people vary. I know some BSGD folks who are killer programmers, though the general population might think otherwise. (And of course it goes the other way as well.)\n\nI love the general CS degree! I'm actually switching to it. I much prefer general engine/tool development to Physics and Graphics, and I think BSCS is perfect for it. If you want to do engine development I think you could make a strong case for going BSCS instead of RTIS and simply taking GAM instead of CSP. I'm going to be a junior (though technically I'll be a few credits off until Spring I think) and I'm planning to take GAM 300/350 and then CSP 400/450 as I want to be able to do at least one \"for fun\" program that isn't just another game. Ideally it'll be something the students or the Zero guys could use to speed up workflow.",

What I've noticed that was common among most of the shitposting on that board were mostly from freshman designers. Not everyone is ready to leave home which many will blame someone else for their problems. It also doesn't help that you'll mostly be doing paper designs first which isn't probably what many expected.  \n\nIf you want a true opinion of the school ask the juniors and seniors. They'll tell you what is 'bullshit' and what isn't. Though I do agree with the person suggesting USC over Digipen as you'll be doing more video game design work.. except it's also expensive.",

I basically heard some form of that complaint more often than not in many of the classes that I attended and from students in other degree programs.\n\nTo me I find that to be a part of DigiPen's charm since really, that's what you're going to hit in the industry to some extent. You might get some documentation, but many companies tend to have tidbits of tribal knowledge that you simply aren't going to know until you figure it out in some way or you find the right person to talk to about it(This is in reference to work flow, learning a new programming language, etc.).\n\nBut yeah, I would agree with the guy above. DigiPen is known by more than a few companies and does carry some weight, but if you can't support the cost it would be to attend DigiPen I would suggest just going after a normal programming degree at a state university. \n\nAlso, there's just a lot of salty people on those forums. Some of their complaints are definitely legitimate and others are just not putting the work in that is needed to get through DigiPen.\n\nMaybe things have changed since I attended though.",

You have extremely bad ones such as the one that Volper hired last year, but fired at the end. He just never really did a good job and it ended up being a joke course with him. On the other hand if you straight up ask for help during their hours then almost all of them will be gladly to help. Which by the way nobody will do and then complain about it. Game class on the other hand is a bit uh.. in my opinion poorly ran. You also have Ben and Rachel focusing their attention to their favorites which makes sense since it's future advertisement, but it's not healthy for the rest. It also doesn't help that Chris Peters left Digipen or at least wasn't there last year.",

That didn't bother me much, but I can definitely see how it can be better.\n\nI never saw the Ben and Rachel focus issue, but given the team I was on back then I probably wouldn't have seen it.

You could turn all of the useful bits of every GAT class into like a 100-page book. DigiPen does not teach you how to design things well.

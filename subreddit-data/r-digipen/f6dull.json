            "comment": "Hi  \nIm also a incoming student going to DIT next year. I was told that usually its smart to stay in dorms the first year to make friends, then move out the second year due to it being significantly cheaper. But in general, I don't mind renting the first year and I have talked to a few other students planning to attend that also intend on renting at some point at least, I come from a much lower cost of living state so whatever I do looks expensive to me but I cant deny that 750 is lower then 1250. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso happy cake day! welcome to Reddit",

Its the same commute time as some of the dorm apartments, cause we lived in the summit before this. Theres super easy public transport from these apts to the school so if anyone here is interested, lets chat! Looking at 667-700 a month since utilities are variable! Private room, lots of space, in unit washer and dryer:)",

            "comment": "Hello, definitely do your research on apartments as redmond is a fairly expensive area. Bellevue/redmond is just expensive but there can be things tucked away. Busing is pretty decent, at least the last time I was in the Seattle area it was, so if you're ok with a commute you can look farther out.\n\nAs an additional note, the way I made friends at DigiPen was that I joined study groups and worked with that same cohort of people through pretty much my entire time at DigiPen.  \n\n\nI'm still friends with many of those people as well.  \n\n\nSomething to consider as another way to make friends.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

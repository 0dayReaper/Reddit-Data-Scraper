    "postText": "Hey there, r/Digipen. I'm hoping you could help me out.\n\n\nSome backstory. I've had my eyes set on Digipens for a few years now while I crawl my way through part-time classes at my local community college. I initially started taking part time classes to supplement a lacking homeschool education in math so that I could get a better score out of my ACTs. This turned into a hunt for an associates degree, which got flipped around several times as my community college tried to figure out how it wanted to handle Computer Science, which turned into me finally getting a better understanding of what Digipen wants in an out of state transfer.\n\nA bad start, some wrong decisions, and a lot of confusion has hurt my GPA quite a bit. By the end of this semester I'll be under a 3.0, and by next I should be over it and approaching 3.2/3.3\n\nMy problem is that I don't have much longer than this semester as, by my understanding, early applications start going in on February for classes starting in September of next year. \n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** I've got the drive and the ability, but my GPA is terrible. How screwed am I? What does Digipen usually want in a GPA, and how does it weigh against recommendations and entry essays? \n\nAny and all help to calm my nerves is greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I was in a similar situation in High School. It wasn't until Junior and Senior year that I got my GPA back up - but unfortunately I was still below a 3.0 before applying to DigiPen. When I applied, I did all of the essays aside from one of the Game Design related ones. I'm not sure what I expected during the admissions process so it wasn't really a surprise when I found out that I had been denied. \n\nFortunately, my poor GPA was not as a result of me struggling as a student. Rather, I had spent all the time that I should have been studying and working on school related stuff, learning how to program and building games/applications/etc. This was what I was really passionate about and to be honest it got me through the boredom of High School. \n\nThe good news is that during my time programming in High School, I was able to build a pretty decent portfolio. After being denied the first go around, I put together a bunch of code samples, projects, and went to teachers for relevant classes such as Calculus and Physics (whom I had got a good relationship with during Junior and Senior year) asking for letters of recommendation. Additionally, I wrote an essay explaining the situation and why I would be a good candidate for DigiPen despite my derogatory academic history in earlier years.\n\nI presented these items to someone in the admissions department. After an appeal review from their admissions council about 2 weeks later, I was accepted.\n\nMoral of the story is that if you're passionate and able to express it with a portfolio or any other tangible validation then GPA is only a small factor in the admissions process (or at least in my experiences in DigiPen).\n\nI wish you luck!",

I appealed, pointing out the information I had already provided explained my one bad grade (a sudden deployment overseas with no internet access).  I was told there was no appeal process, but I'd be welcome to re-apply with a letter from my current math teacher detailing how I was performing in that class.\n\nSo I mailed *another* $150 to them along with a brief typed note from  my pre-Calc teacher and I got back an acceptance letter about 10 days later.",

            "comment": "So the school typically goes about these things in a very loose fashion. There's the tutors, TAs, and faculty, all of whom you should go to for mentorship, but the real mentor stuff comes from relationships with upper classmen. Try to get an in with some game teams above you and find someone that is willing to help you with homework or other work. Go to them early and often (within reason, they have shit to do too) and build that relationship. THAT is the really good mentorship at the school. Good luck!",

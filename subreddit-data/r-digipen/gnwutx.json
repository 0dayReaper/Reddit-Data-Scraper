    "postText": "I'm currently attending CalArts for music composition but find myself not fitting in at all and feeling like a complete outsider. I enjoy the school and the classes but everyone in my grade (just ending my 3rd year) have already split off into their friend groups and people in lower grades tend to be put off that I'm older than them (24). I've tried joining multiple clubs and putting myself out there but rarely have had good results. \n\nOn top of that I feel like I would rather be intensely focusing my music creating skills on composing for media which isn't a field at CalArts (the closest is collaboration/specific classes). And even more on top of that, Digipen is a hell of a lot cheaper than CalArts ($52,850/year).\n\nDue to this (and other issues with the school), I'm considering transferring again, but I'm nervous I'll run into the same problem. If you're a transfer student, how was it for you? Did you integrate well or do you feel the same things I'm feeling?\n\nBonus questions if you're in the music program: Are the classes more focused on technical application of skills? At CalArts it's very much \"do it yourself\". How are the music classes specifically? Do you enjoy them?",

            "comment": "Hello, since no one has responded here I figured I'd try to help. I've been out of the school for 8 years now but I'd imagine time will not affect some of the things you have asked.\n\nFor the most part, yeah, once you get into your junior and senior years there are definitely groups of people that want to work together because they either worked together in Freshman or Sophomore years so you'll likely have a bit of a barrier getting into anything if you plan to enter DigiPen as a junior or senior.\n\nI was technically a transfer student (was at my other college for a year) but only my general education courses transferred so I basically started as a freshman.\n\nAs for the cost it does look like DigiPen is cheaper per year though also consider living expenses if you're living at home right now.\n\nLiving expenses will kick you up by probably another 10k or so (maybe a little less depending on how you budget).\n\nThe thing I did when going into DigiPen was find a study group and stuck with it. Staying with that study group lead to joining game teams that comprised of some of that study group.\n\nI unfortunately don't have much experience with the music programs as those came in right about when I was graduating so I never got to interface with anyone who was going through one.\n\nI also honestly don't know how many music students get through the whole program. The job pool for music is a pretty small footprint in the gaming industry. I know two guys that started a company that have done music for like 150 indie games or something crazy like that. I think they employ around 5-10 people including themselves. So it can be difficult to get into just because there are people like the two guys above who just contract out their work to a ton of games. I work at a big studio(\\~300 devs at my location) as well and there are maybe 10 or so people that do music/sound related work.\n\nBut really, nothing worth doing is easy so you just have to keep kicking and fighting to get your foot in the door.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nGood luck! I graduated from the BSCSGD degree if you have any other questions.",

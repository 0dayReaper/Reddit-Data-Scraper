    "postText": "Hey newcomers. I'm sure some of you new RTIS students are getting into your first graphics classes very soon. If I remember correctly, the first few graphics courses cover basic OpenGL and DirectX 9. But, as we all know, there are more up to date versions of these APIs at our disposal. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n****\nI'm building a framework to use as a framework for prototyping graphics project. The intention is to use it for Master's Level Graphics and Game courses. However, the framework itself is being constructed to be friendly to students new to graphics, and to serve as an understandable demonstration of a good graphics application in a more modern API, DirectX 11. \n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n****\nThere are plenty of examples out there of how to get a graphics program started, but they tend to be academic or atomic. They want to demonstrate one thing or another, and write the least amount of code to get there. This is especially true of books, which either demonstrate a feature with limited code (Intro to DirectX 11 by Frank Luna), or demonstrate a system with too much code to be easy to understand (Game Coding Complete 4). Both books are excellent, but either skim architecture or overload you with architecture.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe secondary goal with this framework is to provide a demonstration of a good usable way to get started with a graphics system.  This aims to have enough functionality and architecture to begin building projects from, but built generically enough to provide a sound example of where to begin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n****\n\nHope you find it instructional. Please send an email to cody.duncan@digipen.edu \n\nif:\n\n1. You have questions.\n2. Find a bug.\n3. Are reading/using the framework and think \"this seems dumb\".\n4. *You have spent more than 10 minutes and cannot answer the question \"What does this do?\"\n5. You think \"This needs ______\". Examples include: Improvement, Clarification, More Shiny.\n6. If you show this to someone else and they do any of the above. (Especially those with experience).\n\n*Note: Does not apply to DirectX function calls. I cannot make that transparent. Read the documentation.\n\nFeedback Appreciated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n****\n[The DirectX Workshop](https://github.com/Cody-Duncan/DirectX11_Workshop)\n\nhttps://github.com/Cody-Duncan/DirectX11_Workshop",

You can sometimes convince a professor to let you use whatever API you like, given that fundamental topics in graphics are agnostic of the API itself. This is especially true if you get a head start in your first year. ;D",

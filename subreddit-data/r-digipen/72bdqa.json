    "postText": "So I\u2019m thinking of transferring to Digipen after I finish my sophomore year at a liberal arts school. I have a lot of connections at Digipen (family works there, I work ProjectFun during the summer, I\u2019m from the area), so I know the ins and outs of the school pretty well. My question is about the BAGD, the program I\u2019m looking at. Is it at all feasible for me, a creative writer who has questionable time management skills (but is willing to learn given the crunch), to come out of that course program alive? To preface any and all answers, I\u2019ve gotten mixed reviews about that particular major, and I\u2019m aware, at least on a surface level lol, about the time commitment. (And of course I\u2019m into video games.)",

            "comment": "Have you looked into how a transfer would work? DigiPen is very strict with what credits they take, and even if they take them, you'll still have to deal with the massive GAM and GAT prereq chains, which will take you 8 and 7 semesters to get through respectively.\n\nAs far as time management goes, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - if you're willing to learn, you're going to have to be sure you can and do it fast, because either you'll develop those skills or you'll fail classes.\n\nForgive me if this sounds patronizing, I don't mean it to be, but have you tried to design anything yet? Do you know what goes into being a game designer? A lot of people think being into games means they'll be into designing games, but those are totally different things.\n\nLastly, as far as the mixed reviews about the major go, I think a lot of it is because of what you take it in reference to. If you compare BAGD to RTIS or some of the other CS degrees, then yeah, it doesn't fare well. There's more need for programmers than designers in the world, and the CS core has way more years of iteration behind it. That said, if you compare BAGD to any other schools design program, the comparison flips, because it's legitimately one of the best out there.\n\nIf you *have* to be a designer, then it's a damn good program, but  you do need to realize how competitive it is. I liken it to breaking into acting, dance, music, etc. Even if you go to the best acting school in the nation, there's no guarantee you make it in Hollywood, and design is the same. IMO, the question is a lot less about if you want to go to DigiPen than it is about if you *really* want to be a designer.",

So yeah, I will definitely have to look into that.\n\nTo address your third paragraph--I don't want to give myself too much credit, but I'm a MAJOR worldbuilding geek, and I'm very passionate about writing for games in particular (games as art and all that). I don't think it would be an impossible stretch to say that I would do well in the creative part of the degree, you know? That being said, I can see how the more technical aspects of the program would easily lose their luster, especially once the whole \"I'm MAKING GAMES!\" thing wears off.  ",

            "comment": "I just wanna give my thoughts too on the subject. I was in the same position as you a year ago, thinking about going to the school fresh out of high school. Now I'm here, and while I'm not a BAGD student (I'm a BSGD, so more computer science, but also still design), I can give some thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Even though its a BAGD program, and people will tell you that it's the \"easiest\", be prepared to work your ass off. I'm sure you know about the school's reputation of being hard, seeing as you have connections there. But design in particular will wring you like a dry towel. This comes across in all degrees there. You're probably gonna hate writing soon enough. I just got finished writing about (the legendary) all the uses a screwdriver can have, at around 6000 words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* By all means, I would recommend still having some computer science knowledge (preferably CSGD I Love it here!), because from a developer standpoint it's good for the designer to think realistically about the scope of their project and what they can implement instead of being the cliche \"woah man...let's do that...\" without any reasoning, but if it's what you wanna do, and you know you wanna, just know that the BAGD still has shaky job placement.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Make connections. Seriously. Start it day one. Especially as a BAGD where there are a lot of extroverted people for some reason in the degree. Those matter a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could go on, but it's a lot of common sense stuff. Just go into it with an open mind. Let me tell you, I was not a good student with time management in high school. Skip homework all the time, never study, I had a \"I'm too good for this class\" type of mentality in some of them. Yknow the teenager thing where people will say \"Wow this is so simple I dont need to learn this\". I'm naturally a good learner, I would consider myself pretty smart actually, and I just breezed through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I just dropped all that shit, and landed on the ground running full sprint. Academics first. I don't care if they try to sell you on the \"social scene\", DigiPen is honestly more of a boot camp than a college. Of course, by all means, have fun and enjoy the social scene, because DigiPen is fucking awesome and everyone is super cool and kind. The worst you'll come across are some Aspian guys who just don't know how to talk. If that's the worst, that's perfectly okay. Treat every subject with interest. I don't care if you get bored during a class because its \"easy\" or its \"boring\", I pay attention nearly 24/7 during my classes. I don't wanna fuck this up. And so far, it's been working out. You don't have to do assignments right away, just don't cram everything into one day. Cause trust me, you just can't with some type of assignments at DigiPen (see: Screwdriver word count). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI sound dramatic, but I've already seen people drop out, and heard some talk through the grapevine about others dropping out. It's not even a month in and people are already succumbing to the pressure. Honestly, I think I'm naturally inclined to like DigiPen, because I would've been bored at my traditional learn gen eds first with 12 credit hours a semester college. I stay late at the school to get assignments done, and I couldn't be happier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd also, if you want more information, I know a senior BAGD fairly well, so I imagine I could link him to you if you want. Just PM me about that or anything else you have question wise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**TL DR; Yeah it's pretty cool. You write a fuck ton. I hate screwdrivers now.**",

            "comment": "Dropped out after my sophomore year after I got an offer to work at a major company in the area. Was RTIS but started as a BAGD. My comment is that you have to put a shitload of time in that first 2 years. You'll be doing lots of playtesting, writeups on that playtesting ad nauseum until you get sick of the concept. Then, you'll do it some more. Then, there's art classes. On top of that, you get to rub shoulders with people with a very high opinion of themselves throughout the day and you will inevitably butt heads.\n\nNow, what I will say on top of that is that while DigiPen does prep you for the industry, it does so in an unrealistic manner and the workload there is more akin to what you might run into during crunch time (and that's still an overstatement). My advice? If you do decide to go, network the shit out of the school like I did and work on side projects throughout the years. Talk to anybody at least a year ahead of you and ignore at least 50% of your current class at least for the first semester since they will inevitably drop out. Once you've made your connections, find out where all of the higher ups hang out at. During my time, it was mostly at the Juanita Pub in Kirkland. Make nice, kiss ass and ask questions. I ended up getting in touch with more than a few people's agents there as well as learning important shit about the industry to keep me ahead of the curve. Eventually, I had several doors to choose from despite the fact that my prototypes at the time were rather mediocre.\n\nWhen it comes to the industry, half the battle is who you know and if you can get that part out of the way, you'll be able to get that real world experience you need, which vastly trumps the 2-3 extra years you'll spend losing hair. Now, I've worked at dozens of studios over the past 5 years with several being AAA status and I already have a healthy nestegg to lie low and work on my personal passion projects, even going so far as to turn down a job offer from 343.\n\nto tl;dr my post: There's 2 ways to beating DigiPen and getting a job in the industry: The hard way and the smart way. I'll let you decide what route you want to take.\n\nedit: Also, use digipenitentary on 8chan as well as other secret groups for DigiPen. It keeps you ahead of gossip and all of drama going on throughout the different divisions. While that isn't really that important, the student blacklists are so make sure you stay off of those and you avoid the people on them. Like I said, it's all about who you know.",

            "comment": "Here's some advice. If you are willing and confident that you want to do Game Design for the rest of your life, go for it. You will be spending 4 years at a school and a lot of money to learn a skill that is only good for one thing. You can't do anything with a BAGD degree other than game design unless you want to work for $10 an hour or something (not worth the $ is takes to get the degree btw).\n\nNot saying personally you couldn't do something else. A lot of BAGD who have taught themselves other stuff like art or programming or production skills have been able to branch out but that is all on you and you alone, because being a BAGD will only teach you game design and way too much of it.\n\nIt's what I wanted MY ENTIRE LIFE so I don't really mind being locked into this career (cause I don't have any other skills), and that's the kind of confidence you would want ideally for a BAGD degree. Because if you end up being a half-ass game designer you are basically worthless as a junior employee and no one's going to want to hire that. Unless you become friends with someone who can get you a job I guess. Don't count on that though cause you probably won't even make it out of DigiPen with that attitude but I have seen a few BAGD's manage to slip by.",

It prepares you very well to do UI or UX for non-game applications, and I wouldn't be that surprised if it worked for other design fields like industrial design, although I've never seen someone attempt that. I've also seen BAGDs pick up producing skills and go that route.\n\nThat said, there are better, more focused places to learn those things if that's what someone's into, so I agree with the conclusion that it's only worth it if you're 100% sold on being a game designer.",

I think you would still have to make an effort for something like UI/UX because I imagine that requires better knowledge of graphic design than BAGD gets, and I only ever really had one UI/UX class from a pretty \"alternative\" instructor. It's not a huge jump though. I could see myself doing general UI/UX with some practice and a new portfolio.\n\nI have my doubts something like industrial design really lends itself to a game design degree but like I said it probably depends on your background and other details. But I imagine a degree you'd need for industrial design is cheaper than a degree at digipen?",

For pure UX positions, which are appearing more and more, I think you'd be set with what DigiPen gives. That comes with the normal caveat that you have to be doing that kind of work on your GAM projects, though.\n\nI think industrial design does translate well, because of the UX and general design training, but like I said, I've never seen anyone actually try to go do that from here. I just would bet that if someone tries that, they'll succeed. And yeah, the other degrees you could get to do that would be cheaper, easier, more specialized for it, and probably better overall. It's just that if you get trained here as a BAGD and have an \"oh shit I don't want to be a game dev\" moment, that's something you could probably go do instead.\n\nThinking about it, user research is probably on that list too, if you go the 360/361/370 route.",

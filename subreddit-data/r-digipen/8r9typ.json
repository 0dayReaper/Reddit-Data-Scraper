(I.e CD Projekt Red was recently looking for audio programmer interns as well as full time audio programmers).\n\n\nHope that helps  If you have any questions about the degree beyond job placement, feel free to ask!\n",

Definitely sounds great there's a growing demand, but towards the game industry or in general?\n\nHow's the facilitation of internships/career fairs for you guys? I noticed talks like CPPCon are gonna be held nearby too (Bellevue), do people get encouraged to sign up for stuff like that?",

I've really enjoyed everything so far, and my upcoming junior year is going to be the first year we really get into the nitty-gritty of Digital Signal Processing and the like, so it only seems to be getting better from here.\n\n  \n\n\nI've noticed that there's definitely a growing demand in games, and the music industry (I've seen some audio programmer stuff from raw music companies), but outside these two fields I haven't seen much - though, I have not been looking outside those two industries so that could just be due to that.\n\nI definitely want to note, that the curriculum prepares you for basically any CS role, not just an audio programmer. I'm extremely comfortable with core engine programmer, in addition to intermediate level graphics programming. So, should it be necessary, a BSDA grad can fulfill nearly any role.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Internships and Career Fairs at DigiPen are pretty sweet. While I never got any offers, I was able to do coding exams for companies like Insomniac and ArenaNet.\n\nCPPcon and the like are definitely encouraged!",

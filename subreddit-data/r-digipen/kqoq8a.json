What are the Game Design and Developement and CS in Real-time Interactive Simulation courses like? I'm more interested in the programming aspect but I still want to know about game design. I've heard that being a generalist kills you in the career.\n2. How difficult is it really transitioning from high school to college?\n3. So I'm from North Dakota, and if you came from out of state, what is it like being away from friends and family and how did you cope with it?\n4. What do you honestly think about Digipen, was it worth the cost for you and are you enjoying your time there?\n\nThanks a bunch",

I've heard that being a generalist kills you in the career.\n\nRTIS is the best degree hands down if you want to be a programmer in games, but you can easily do regular programming jobs as backup.\n\nCS in game design degree has design classes that enable you to be a designer, but it lacks the low level engine / graphics classes in the RTIS degree.\n\n* How difficult is it really transitioning from high school to college?\n\nDepends on you, usually the most sheltered kids who have the most extreme transition from no freedom -&gt; total freedom are at the most risk of things going awry. For me personally I played too much League of Legends and had a bad first semester, but made it through in 5 years not failing any classes after that semester.\n\n* So I'm from North Dakota, and if you came from out of state, what is it like being away from friends and family and how did you cope with it?\n\nYou'll make friends (assuming it's IRL next year)\n\n* What do you honestly think about Digipen, was it worth the cost for you and are you enjoying your time there?\n\nI never would have gotten into the industry without it, totally worth it for me personally, but you'll find a wide array of opinions on that.\n\n-- BAGD working in the industry for 3+ years",

            "comment": "I think others have answered pretty well, but I can add my two cents.\n\n1) I agree with the others that RTIS is the best if you know you want to focus on programming. If you have interest in the game design aspects too, BSCSGD is still good. That's my major, and I had no real issues getting a programming job in the industry, and it won't turn you into a generalist. However, like others said, I can't do low level programming like graphics programming (but I personally don't have an interest in that)\n\n2) As long as you are determined and self aware, you'll be fine. I had a tough first semester as I realized I couldn't skate through my classes without really trying anymore like I did in high school. After that, I stepped up and did much better.\n\n3) I'm from Tennessee. It was an adjustment moving out here. I started out feeling a bit lonely and that the school environment was quite competitive. But you'll make a lot of new friends really quickly, between game teams and roommates. Missing family is still tough, as I still live out here, and plane tickets are expensive. But in the end, you'll face that at almost any out of town college.\n\n4) DigiPen taught me what I needed and gave me a career. I had a great time there and made some great friends and some good games. At the time I was there, I wished that they had more support for mental health (they had a single free counselor, but she was overwhelmed) and more resources for struggling students, both financially and academically. I believe that they had intentions to improve upon those things, but I don't know if anything specific that's changed. (I graduated in 2016)",

                            "comment": "Low level is more referring to the structure/type of programming rather than the difficulty/expertise needed. So graphics programming and physics engines are built into a game engine, which may then have a \"lower level\" language such as C++ and a higher level scripting language built on top. And then you build your game with all of that.\n\nSo if you imagine each of these dependencies stacked on top of each other, the lowest level ones are core, often difficult pieces to make everything else work. As a BSCSGD, I wouldn't be much help with rendering code or a physics engine. I had one graphics class and I've forgotten most of it. I could probably write a game engine again, but where I shine is gameplay programming: writing game systems and features, not lower level code than that.",

            "comment": "Hey. I can't speak for the RTIS degree, but I can answer questions 2 and 4. \n\n2. It all depends honestly. I'm in my freshman year, and just finished the fall semester, and it was hectic. If you are a naturally hard worker, with great work ethic, you'll have an easier time transitioning. If your like me, and you struggle maintaining focus on classes, and get off track easily, you will struggle. But, its definitely doable. I think its especially hard doing distance learning, since its harder to stop yourself from getting off topic, but if your not going for another year or so, I'm sure you wont have to deal with that. In general, don't worry too much about how difficult to transition it will be. It will be hard, but if its what you want to do, go for it.\n\n4. With my first semester down, I can say that I really enjoy it. After going through several high school CS classes, I can say they barely scratched the surface on what DigiPen has taught me in just 15 weeks. I think its definitely worth it if it is your dream to be in the game industry. Its really expensive, but there is always financial aid, and loans you can take out. Just do extensive research, and see what scholarships you can apply to. If you belong to any minority groups, or require extensive financial aid, it will be a lot easier finding aid.\n\nI hope that helped!",

            "comment": "Hiya! Just graduated in December (BSCSGD) \n\n1) RTIS vs CSGD\nThe basic just of this is that RTIS are made to be graphics and engine programmers while CSGDs are made to be gameplay/AI programmers or in some cases, designers. PLEASE NOTE: The CSGD changed starting 2018. I started 2017, when this degree took the same design classes as the bachelor of arts, and took a bit less CS than it currently does. Now they take design classes that are catered to them and are more about gameplay specific implementation rather than from the ground up design (I had to make board games lol. The new cohorts don't have to). \n\nI have been able to work professionally as a designer and a programmer with my degree (including internship), but I think it'd be harder to get a design job with the current BSGD. However, I wouldn't worry about being a generalist, simply being a good programmer is most important, and you can still find a niche as a BSGD (gameplay and AI being the most common). \n\n2) Transition to College\nIdk about you, but I really coasted through high school with good grades, and never really studied. At DigiPen, you'll be working your ass off even if you're smart. Biggest difference is time management and taking stuff more seriously. \n\n3) Moving\nI did 7th-12th grade in a boarding school so I can't really help here. I was kind of used to it. That being said DigiPen is an awesome community and is very welcoming to all people. \n\n4) Was it worth it? \nI definitely would not have gotten a job in the game industry right away without this degree. I definitely would not have made some cool games during college if I didn't go here. I'm not much more in debt than the average USA college grad, so that's good too. \n\nHowever, I do feel like I missed out on the \"best years of your life\" trope that college gets. I think some of that is on me though, and the fact that I didn't have a car. You can have fun if you make time for it, and if you want to, I'd recommend trying to make friends who don't go to DigiPen in case you ever find the atmosphere suffocating. \n\nFeel free to DM with questions. \nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Hello, I think everyone else here has answered 1-3 pretty well so I figured I'd focus on 4 since I may have more time in the industry. I graduated in 2012 through the BSCSGD degree. I'm currently a technical designer at a AAA company and have been for about 6 years now.\n\nWhen it comes to cost (is it worth it) it depends on how much you plan to cover before you take out loans. I personally didn't have any support from my family who were unfortunately middle class(made too much but didn't save for college) so I didn't get a lot of federal student aid support. Most of my loans ended up being private loans.\n\nBy the end of it all my student loans totaled well over $100,000. I took out loans to support the tuition and my living expenses. I'm still in debt \\~9 years later and at minimum have 4 more years before I fully pay them off. To be fair though the 4 years required does include other debts I have but it does require discipline to throw butt loads of money at the debt month after month.\n\nSo, the above is the downside if you plan to take out a boat load of loans but here's the plus side.\n\nDigiPen has a rigorous course schedule that will definitely prepare you for the industry. I have never quite felt like I was floundering while working in the industry and I credit that to DigiPen. DigiPen also provides an environment filled with other people that will make it into then industry that you can make friends with who down the road can offer opportunities of getting into the company they work for or at least give you a chance of getting a job there. You also have the alumni who are already out in the industry who are aware of DigiPen's education quality and may consider you over other candidates simply because you went to DigiPen.\n\nThe number of benefits are staggering BUT, and this may seem obvious, if you plan to go to DigiPen make sure you get completely through the program or get a job in the industry. If you fail out it can be very painful given the cost.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to ask more questions!",

So I go over to the readdmission application, sign in to reapply, and it says \"error\". So things are looking like I might be accepted, however I go over to enroll fee and it says \"I have to be allowed to join\" or something.\n\nI have no idea what's going on, failing to pay for enrollment and trying to reapply seems to lead me to no clear answer. \n\nI just hope it's not too late to reapply if I end up not being accepted.",

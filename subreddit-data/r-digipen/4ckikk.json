    "postText": "A lot of complaints I hear about Digipen revolve around really only 2 things. Cost and workload. As a prior Marine I have my GI bill that pays 100% of tuition as well as stipend for books and I also get a monthly paycheck for living (which for that area comeso out to roughly over 2k) so I'm not worried about the cost for school. Not to mention. I get FAFSA every semester that becomes straight pocket money due to my GI bill paying my full tution  (which should is roughly another 3k a semester). As for the workload what do some of you current or former students do to manage workloads. I'm pretty good at scheduling time and I'll be moving up with a a friend but any tips you have will be much appreciated. Some other questions are how long do you guys find yourself at school? Right now I attend college from 8am-2pm taking 4 classes. Also would there be any other complaints you guys have outside of cost and workload?",

            "comment": "Former 2673/8156 here.  First off, I'm pretty sure that the GI Bill doesn't cover your whole tuition.  Like, I just looked in my wallet and I'd bet the 7 dollars in there that it doesn't.  *However*, Digipen classified themselves/got named as a \"Yellow Ribbon\" school (just as I was leaving!) so they effectively subsidize what the VA won't pony up to them.  \n\nSecondly, complaints about the workload will be defined by your degree program (e.g. art students feel the sting their first year, RTIS feel it in their second year, etc.) but a lot of the pain is delivered on to the student/team by themselves.  There are people that go through Digipen in a passable fashion and have a job at the end, and then their are the individuals/teams that fucking hustle and end their time at Digipen *recognized*.\n\nFor all the complaints I've ever had about my alma mater, the school really does appreciate the former military among it's students.  Just remember that it's a family-owned private company, credits won't transfer, and that there will be some days that will make you question the \"of Technology\" portion of their name.",

I haven't used my GI Bill yet and from my understanding they pay $21,970.46 per year for a private school and according to the charts on the school average tuition per year for my program is 29,000 but like I said that is also being supplemented with Pell every semester and I didn't even know about them being apart of the Yellow Ribbon program so that's another plus.

            "comment": "Your military benefits cover a specific number of months of school, if you're using them currently they will run out before you graduate, and you can't use them in the summer (at least it's not cost effective to do so).\n\nThe workload is very high for artists, depending on how good you are at programming it could be light or heavy. Much of the work is for game projects, because it takes a lot of time to make a game you're proud of, and if that's not your goal don't come to DigiPen.\n\nA lot of classes the school is having trouble filling with skilled staff, so it's not uncommon to have a class taught poorly by a different instructor each year. There are other classes which are consistently taught very well, and you will be required to take both types. \n\nOn average you'll have around 20 hours of classes/lecture time per week, 2-3 hours of homework per credit hour of class, and any remaining time will be spent on game. It's fairly common to show up whenever your first class is (typically between 9am and noon) and stay until you get kicked out at midnight. If you are efficient at your chosen focus, you can do your work a lot faster and it will suck less, but that is the exception, not the norm.\n\nYou can probably get better advice if you mention the degree program you'll be in.",

The male to female ratio is horrendous, in the BS degrees it's around 20:1. DigiPen is also very much not about other things; there are no frats, no sororities, no sports teams, clubs involving physical activity aren't allowed, and the diversity is very lacking in many ways. A lot of people also grow very jaded as they progress through the school. The school is getting overcrowded, and there isn't really sufficient space for all the students anymore. A lot of classes are not taught well and the school has a constant cycle of hire - 2 semesters of complaints - fire - repeat. You'll be treated like a second class citizen at your own school during any project fun events, project fun being the summer camp DigiPen runs on campus.",

Not intrested in athletics or any of that. I really just want to come and learn a craft that has intrested me since before I can remember. I prefer linking up in LANS and playing games with friends more so then I do about drinking or bar hopping or whatever it is that people do these days. I'm not saying I don't mind a night out with a few friends catch a game at the bar and knock a few back but I they have a sports bar or a local tavern (which I'm sure they do) I'm more then satisfied. As for the faculty I did hear some of that going around but it was more or less suppressed by the complaints of expense and workload. Do you think its enough of a problem that it has effected your ability to learn? I get that I'll need to put in some time and do my own research and learn some things on my own but I don't think that the lecture time should be completely wasted also",

That said though, balance is important in life, and the complete lack of anything else in life while at DigiPen is unhealthy. I have grown a lot as a programmer, but I really am not happy at DigiPen and at my team meeting today over half my team agreed that we're just ready for the year to be over. We're a really performant team as well, having received unofficial invitation to show our game at pax and many of us hold TA positions.",

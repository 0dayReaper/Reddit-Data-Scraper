    "postText": "I'm currently a high school student considering digipen's RTIS program. I was hoping that some RTIS alumni could provide some insight as to 1. the value of the degree in terms of getting a job and internships(were you able to get internships early on or were they hard to find), 2. How much math and physics is actually involved in classes as well as post-college jobs(I really enjoy math and physics and plan on getting a minor in both so any information as to the depth of the math and physics classes as well as the topics covered would be greatly appreciated), 3. What were your specific roles on game teams, and 4. what was your schedule like during the typical semester(did you spend most of your day in classes or studying at home). Answers to any of these questions is greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "I was in the RTIS program from 2001-&gt;2004, and then went on to work on my master's a in 2005, but didn't complete it before finding a job.  I'm now a software development lead at Microsoft and have a dozen engineers who report to me - about half of whom are DigiPen RTIS grads.\n\nThe degree is very well respected by most - sometimes you'll find someone who had previously hired a dP grad and it didn't work out, but in general DigiPen spits out high quality engineers. In general, when I go to hire someone entry-level I will interview non-DigiPen and DigiPen grads, and they are just generally much more suited to working on games. More experience working on exactly the kinds of things we need done on a game.\n\nMath and physics is very important - but less important than algorithms and data structures.  But that varies greatly with the job. If you're going to be working on a physics engine, or working on a game that uses a physics engine and you're rigging it up, then absolutely you need knowledge of how game physics is usually done. My job doesn't require physics at all. However, I do need to know how to use vectors and set 3d orientations and understand high level concepts for quaternions.\n\nI've held positions at 3 companies - Amaze Entertainment (no longer exists) where I was the main gameplay programmer on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest for the PSP. Then at Sony Online Entertainment (now Daybreak) where I coded backend server software for MMOs, and got to work on most of the games they made from 2006-2012, including Planetside, Planetside 2, Free Realms, The Agency, DC Universe Online, etc. Afterwards I came to Microsoft, where I am now.  You can check out my linked in page for more details, though I haven't updated it in two years:  [https://www.linkedin.com/in/billcarl/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billcarl/)\n\nMy schedule at DigiPen was ROUGH. I was in the last class they allowed to do \"Iron Man\", where we get the 4 year degree in 3 years.  I was taking 21-23 credit hours per semester, which is roughly double a full load at most other colleges. Worked 13 hours a day, basically from campus open to close. Being at school was better for me than working at home, due to having 4 people crammed in a 2-bedroom apartment.\n\nI hope this helps give you some background info on the school. I can highly recommend it - but don't think that just getting in is going to change your life. It is only an opportunity. An opportunity to work your ass off and learn a hell of a lot more than at most other colleges. Being surrounded by teachers who are in the industry and other students will will be is incredibly helpful - I still keep in touch with former students and those contacts have made great career opportunities. Likewise, there are people I went to school with who weren't well suited or interested (which is fine - learn that early!!), or squandered their opportunity, didn't work hard, and now aren't successful in the games industry.\n\nGood luck!",

One of the labs when I took it was building a binary adder with wires and transistors. Then the class moved on to assembly programming. I liked it, but it's pretty hard and a lot of people hate it.\n\nI still have the structure of IEEE-754 representation lodged in my brain.",

If recommend numberphile and computerphile on YouTube. In terms of the assembly part I'm not sure what type of assembly they're even teaching in there any more, but when I took it it was ARM v7 with some extensions. It's not too scary just take good notes and put in the effort to practice, as (at least when I took it) the assignments alone were not enough.",

It\u2019s not a textbook, just an intro to topics written in a pretty standard nonfiction style. Code by Charles Petzold. Sorry for the late reply lol",

            "comment": "Hello, I agree with what Aevek says here.\n\nAlso, since this is one of the first classes you'll be taking it's more of an exploration of the computer hardware and how they work.\n\nSo while it might appear to be hard I don't believe it to be a class to weed you out from continuing through the school (It didn't seem like that when I took it at least). It's just to get you acquainted with how computers work and experimenting with building simple systems within a computer.\n\nIt's likely something you will not think much about once you complete the course until you get to much more advanced topics and even then, it's not something that comes up too often. Really depends on what you end up putting your focus on though.",

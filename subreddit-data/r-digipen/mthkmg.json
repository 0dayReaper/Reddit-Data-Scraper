    "postText": "Thankfully, I got admit from Digipen. I am grateful. I hope to survive. My program is Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation.  As the title question states, do I need to learn coding beforehand as a first-year (freshmen) student? Or do they teach from scratch in the beginning? \n\nIs there something else that I need to worry about? Some tips on how to handle coursework would be great.",

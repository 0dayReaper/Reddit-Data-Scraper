    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI'm a potential student making the drive up to DigiPen (Redmond campus) today for a couple student shadows over the weekend and the undergrad programs preview day. Since this place seems to have a lot of other potential students wanting questions answered, and not everyone will be able to make it up here for one of these events, I figure it might be nice to let people not as geographically blessed as myself get their questions answered.\n\nSo hit me up with questions you might have about the programs, environment or whatever, I'll ask them when appropriate, and respond to as much as I can by Sunday at the latest.\n\nEdit:\n\nHaven't gotten any questions yet, if any interested students are reading this: hit me up.\n\nAlso: anyone even remotely interested in music, sound design or audio programming HAS to see their studio. That setup was probably the sweetest thing I've ever seen.",

How's daily life on the campus? Is there much social stuff going on/parties? How cold does it get in the winter? Digipen is a pretty small college, just 1000 I think, does it feel very small? Thanks!",

You get experience working with designers, programmers, and artists.\n\nIt's definitely a small school, that's my only real complaint. Small school with an awful male to female ratio. There are parties fairly often, but definitely nothing like at a big school, think max 20 people usually.\n\nWinter isn't too cold, it's been like 60 degrees Fahrenheit this month, but you can just look up weather for Redmond, WA and see detailed info.\n\nMainly you get out of it what you put in. If you try hard and do a lot, you will learn a lot. If you don't, it's probably not going to work out well for you. Successful students are very successful though, it's uncommon for a junior to not be able to get a paid internship at a decent company, and a good number of sophomor can too.\n\nYou also have a great resource in other students, and student teams get their own space allocated on campus that nobody else can use.",

The network drive is great, but can get a little off near assignment due dates when everyone's using it a lot. You can get individual and team SVNs or Gits as well. \n\nEssentially, you do not need to bring any tech with you. That said, I highly highly recommend getting a good laptop. The school cannot be open 24/7, sometimes working from home or elsewhere is more convenient, and obv. you can install any software you want on your own machine. Only one large classroom has Steam downloaded, for example.\n\nBasically, you pay out the nose in tuition for a reason, so the tech in the facilities is generally pretty solid.",

The school also employs a (fairly) reliable network drive which seems to have a nearly unlimited amount of space for students. As far as programs, they use visual studio, an in-house engine called Zero, and the full Microsoft office suite. There's more, but I can't recall much else at the moment, unless you want to hear about the music department :-)",

    "postText": "I was told there are some on campus jobs for students at Digipen (like the store) and I had a few questions regarding them:\n\n1.  How difficult is it to get these jobs? Do only a select few get them?\n\n2.  Does class matter when it comes to getting one of these jobs? Can you get them as a freshmen? Do upper classmen get priority?\n\n3. How much do these jobs pay and roughly what hours can/do you get?\n\n4.  Aside from the store what other opportunities are there for student on campus jobs?\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

            "comment": "1. Depends. Are you a failing student? Well you probably won't get the job, but you'll probably also drop the school entirely.... Is the job degree/class specific? Then it depends on if the instructor's/program heads believe that you can do well as a TA/tutor based on your previous performance. It's not necessarily difficult to get a job, but there are only so many openings for the jobs, so I'd describe it more as competitive.\n2. You definitely won't get anything fall first year, and you can't get any TA/tutor jobs spring first year afaik, but other stuff like the store may be available the second semester. Upper classmen don't inherently have priority, only in that they generally have more experience in a particular class/subject.\n3. They start at I think $11/hour and every semester you continue to work your pay goes up $0.50. Depending on your job your hours vary. Over the past couple semesters I've been able to make $100-$250ish per month.\n4. TA, tutor, store are the most common jobs during the school semesters. I believe there are also some positions available in the outreach department but I'm not as familiar with those. In the summer there's ProjectFUN which pays handsomely more, I'll just say that the reduced pay I have for training PFun is more than what many people make as a TA at DigiPen, and the pay when the workshops run is a nice bump higher than that. But that does mean PFun is much more competitive.",

            "comment": "Many of the jobs don't have all that many applicants, so if you are in active pursuit of campus employment you'll almost certainly get it. Some jobs are a lot more competitive than others, though, so gauge appropriately.  \n\nIf memory serves, you can start working on campus after first semester freshman year. It could be sophomore year, but I don't believe it is. The school will hire the best candidate for the job. I don't believe the priority goes to upperclassmen, but most staff know upperclassmen better than underclassmen so there may be a bias there unofficially. \n\nJobs pay roughly $12 an hour, matching whatever Redmond minimum wage is this week. If you're employed by ProjectFUN over summer you make $15-18/hour, I believe that's the highest student jobs will get. Hours are about 10/week but depend on the job. There's a cap on how much you can work but I don't remember what it is. \n\nLibrary, student store, department assistant (student affairs, outreach, etc), housing assistant, front desk, Space TA, class TA, and ProjectFUN/Homeschool all come to mind off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more.",

            "comment": "As a side note here in case it wasn't mentioned or it's not readily apparent you should be able to get access to a lot of software that DP requires as well once you are a student. At least back when I went I was able to get free/or very cheap copies of Visual studio, and the microsoft office suite along with whatever else I needed for the most part.\n\nI'm obviously not a current student but when I attended I picked up a laptop it was a dell XPS. Those look pretty spendy now. I'd say the one thing you definitely don't want to skimp on though is RAM as game editors use up a lot of it. 16GB as the recommendation seems reasonable though.\n\nProbably want to avoid Alienware as they are pricier even than the XPS and unless you're handy with configuring dual boot you probably want to avoid apple laptops as well.",

But here is what the juniors and seniors generally recommend:\n\n* Windows or Linux (i.e. no macbooks)\n* NVIDIA GPU preferred (required for RTIS)\n* \\&gt;= 16GB RAM\n* HDMI/DP output preferred (makes it easy for presentations)\n\nAlso, one consideration you'd like to have is having a laptop without a loud clicky keyboard, or  fans that goes crazy loud whenever the laptop turns on. Many times have my math professor comment that my laptop was about to take off during lectures. -\\_-\"",

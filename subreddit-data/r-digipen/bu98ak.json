    "postText": "I am interested in going to Digipen for the BFA in digital arts and animation but I'm worried whether it is worth it or not. I qualify for the yellow ribbon program which would pay for some of it, but I don't want to be in debt for something I may be able to go to college for somewhere else. Would going to Digipen raise my chances of making it in the game industry in any way? Thanks.",

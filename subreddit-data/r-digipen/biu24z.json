    "postText": "I\u2019m going to digipen in the fall, but this past year I\u2019ve been taking classes at another school. The class descriptions are basically identical to early classes in the BAGD program. In fact I used my work from these classes in my portfolio, and their probably a big reason why I got in. Because of this I\u2019m really opposed to taking some of the early classes in the program like DES 105, MUS 115, DES 115, MAT 100. I would love to take all these classes over again but I don\u2019t exactly have the money, especially since housing added a good chunk more. I\u2019ve emailed faculty about this, and after collecting all the classes that I\u2019ve already done and comparing them to classes in digipen. I was denied any transfers. Is there any other way? Anyone I should talk to, or should I make a in person appointment?",

I was told since I came from the art institute of Seattle (which ran on quarter systems) that I needed TWO class equivalents for every ONE digipen credit. Along with several other qualifications such as additional portfolio work and a B in the course",

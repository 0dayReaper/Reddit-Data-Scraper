Is the pay off worth the cost?\n\nIs there other options, ie piece-mealing something together that gets you similar results from a local state college/community college?\n\nThe school sounds interesting but the price tag does not...not to mention the \"mental breakdowns\" that I have been reading about.",

            "comment": "This is a discussion I have with other alumni, incoming students, and current students a lot. My short answer is yes, but I would do it far differently, mainly doing it over 5 years from the start instead switching a couple years in. I came in having basically no idea what I was getting into straight out of American highschool. I was over confident in my abilities and could not really conceive the scope of the work load. \n\nDespite the amount of work in the first couple years I was able to slack a bit in certain area and still get by. It wasn't till a majority of the curriculum was unfamiliar that I started falling behind and realized the dedication that was really needed. \n\nDigiPen is brutal. I basically buckled down and dedicated 90% of my life to it. I started spending 10-14 hours a day 6-7 days a week on campus, partially because I'm less productive at home. Because of this dedication I ended up on good teams with good projects that have in turn led to my success post graduation. While not all graduates put in this much time Most seem to have similar experiences.\n\nAs for can you get what the school offers elsewhere? I highly doubt it, at least not in the same time frame. While there are issues with the school, the value of some of the classes and the quantity of experience you get is unmatched when I meet graduates from other schools. You could get a solid education in CS, design, or art in other schools, but everything I learned was from the perspective of game development. Other colleges simply don't have you make 4-10 (varies based off your degree program) games over your time with them.\n\nCould you go get a good education in these individual fields at other colleges? Sure, but I think you would miss out on a lot of the nuances that are learned in an environment that is almost 100% centered around games.\n\nMy advice always ends up being, you must know 100% that games are where you belong. It's not entirely about what you want, for me it was I can't see my natural skill set that I've developed working very well in many other fields. I didn't know this when I went in, but when I realized it, that is what drove me to complete my degree at DP.\n\nFor me the answer is yes. For others I know the answer is no. I feel like I kinda got lucky in that I can't imagine doing anything else. I do no graduates that have/had other interests or career thoughts. Most of them are glad they stuck it through, a few regret dedicating themselves to a focused endeavour like this with out knowing what they were getting into and how they would feel once done.\n\nAs for the price tag that's everyone's worry. In my experience it is the ones who don't wholely dedicate themselves who can't manage the debt post graduation. Most grads I know are in the industry. Sure not all of us got right into the AAA studios we imagined, but I can't see any of them not getting there in the next few years. The only thing I would say is most people can't afford to do indie development for awhile after graduation. I know several people who dropped out to start indie companies, but they are the rare exception. I personally can't afford to take the risk on indie development for awhile. That's OK with me though as that is more along the lines of my 10 year plan and not something I ever planned on doing right out of college.\n\nI could keep going but I have things to do today that are not Reddit. Hopefully this helps, good luck, and I highly suggest you keep researching not just the school, but game development in general to make sure its for you.",

            "comment": "BSGD Alumni(2012) here.  \n  \nIf I had to do everything all over again, would I?  \n  \nNo. Would I pursue getting into the game industry? Perhaps. If I were to do that though I would seek out options that are less costly. Someone who works next to me went to University of Utah and paid quite a bit less than what I owe to student loans. They have a similar degree program along with University of Utah being in the top three of the princeton review for that degree program. I can't quite gauge his skill level compared to what mine was when I graduated but I can say that he is confident in his skills and prepared to do the work that needs to get done. I have heard that DigiPen has gotten considerably more expensive since I attended and I wouldn't wish that amount of debt onto anyone even if they get a solid degree out of it. Oh, also, if you can simply show that you have attempted to make games and were mildly successful at it I feel that you would easily have a chance of getting at least a phone interview(First step in the hiring process usually) with more than a few game companies. Experience beats out education. DigiPen just has people do both, hence its effectiveness at creating graduates that can start in the industry at a run.\n  \nWhen searching for jobs after DigiPen it can get pretty hectic. If you're a programmer you'll most likely have an easier time, but design and art are a whole other ball game. I went through 3 jobs(within a year and a half) before I came upon one where I was getting paid enough to actually have money after all the bills were paid. My student loan payments are equivelant to my apartment rent. It sucks. I wish I would have pursued more scholarships and grants. Would have helped in the long run.  \n  \nBUT, do I like what I'm doing now in the industry? Yes I do, I love it. Could I get a higher paying job as a programmer outside of games? Potentially. Will I pursue that? Some day I probably will. Need to get some experience in the industry though so I can use that to move into something else (My degree doesn't outright say that I'm a programmer so I need a few jobs that say otherwise).  \n  \nIn all my 4 years at DigiPen, I think I saw maybe one mental breakdown. I'm sure there were more, but I feel like it's not as prevalent as others may make it seem. Some people have never had to handle the workload that DigiPen gives that they bend under the strain. Perhaps DigiPen gives people too much work. I always saw it as, \"it's only downhill from here\". Most graduates I have spoken with agree with that as well. Once you're in the industry things get easier because all you're working on is a game. You don't have to worry about anything else while at work.  \n  \nFeel free to ask more questions. I'm here. \n\nEDIT: spacing and grammar corrections ",

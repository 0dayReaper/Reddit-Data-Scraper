I am pretty confident though that digipen is the best place to get an art degree if you want to work in games specifically, since you get experience working with game teams at the school (if you choose to do that over animation projects)\n\n&gt; im not super worried about loans, but is there any scholarship opportunities with digipen?\n\nhttps://www.digipen.edu/financial-aid/scholarship-information/undergraduate-scholarships/\nThere are some, they vary based on your finanaces and app, \n\n&gt; thanks for your time, this is my first time posting to reddit so im not sure what your rules n such are so if I'm doing something super dumb lemme know\n\nHit enter twice to make a new line",

    "postText": "\"Free time\", as in, any time excluding lectures, labs, assignments, and the amount of work you have to do in order to pay rent. Time that you could spend, say, socializing, gaming, or just relaxing. \n\n\nI'm most interested in answers from those who are in the BFA program, because that is the degree I will potentially be pursuing. However, I welcome everyone to answer, because I'm also interested to see the differences in free time between degree programs. \n\n\nI've already talked to a freshman in the BFA program who says he spends 30 hours per week on lectures, labs, and assignments. To me, that doesn't seem like much, considering all the horror stories about overworking. I currently spend 35 hours per week in HS, just attending classes--not including the time I spend on homework and studying. ",

            "comment": "It absolutely depends on year and point in the semester. It also has a lot to do with what you're already familiar with and how quickly you pick up concepts. Digital painting assignments took me 10+ hours each where they took some people 3. I can whip out animation in 4 hours where it takes others 8. \n\nIn general, BFA is 18 credits/semester. That means 18 hours in classes. The general rule is for ever credit, you get 2 hours of homework. So 18x3=54. \n\nMost of the time you won't spend 6 hours on every class. However, there are the heavy hitter classes that take even more time every week. And then there's things like game and film teams, where you may be working without credit but you have to do it to keep your teammates from failing. \n\nAs far as years go, freshman year is absolutely the easiest as far as homework load goes ever since they redesigned the program. However, it's that way to help people adjust to college and not send their mental health into the gutter immediately. \n\nI'm currently a junior BFA. I work roughly 10 hours a week, and probably do schoolwork another 55-60. I treat myself by not doing homework after my classes on Friday. ",

I don't have any freshman currently that I can confirm that with, but it's probably a good rough estimate. Contrast that with my current schedule, where I spent 63 hours on a single class in two weeks. ",

Including all the time that goes into my game project, I'm probably closer to 70 or so hours of work a week.) \n\nSo I'd say on average I have about ~30 hours of free time a week.\n\n",

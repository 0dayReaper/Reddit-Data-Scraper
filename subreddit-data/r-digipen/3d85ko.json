    "postText": "For now, ignoring the huge amounts of work load I've heard, and the large amount of drop outs, Digipen interests me a lot. I'm approaching my last year in highschool and as childish as it may be I would be very interested in studying game design. The Computer Science and Game Design degree seems perfect actually. The only qualms I have however, is whether I will regret going to a very game design-centric college. What if I suddenly find that game design isn't for me? What then? This is what's keeping me on the fence, and I would really appreciate some feedback. Thank you! ",

Maybe consider a year of community college to focus on general ed stuff and to try on all the different \"hats\" of game development. If you find you don't like any, it's way easier to back out. If you find you do, you'll know which one to go into before applying.",

Majority of your credits will not transfer to another college and to transfer gen ed credits at $600-900/credit is absurd when your community college offers them anywhere from $10-300/credit. You can however switch degrees within digipen and salvage it. Otherwise, there is no nice way to put it but that's true for a lot of degrees.  \n\nIn my opinion, as a senior at digipen in computer science in real time interactive simulation I personally believe the game design degrees are uhh.. silly. It's an extremely limited field to spend $100k to obtain a degree in. At least the comp sci in game design gives you something you can fall back on, but if that's the case you're better off going to something like USC or even DuPaul.  \n\nGo to community college, take a few random classes and decide what you truly want. At the very least take your gen ed classes there (math, english, physics, etc). It's probably the best advice that a lot of people ignore.",

I'm around $100k in debt from attending DigiPen. I graduated and have a job in the industry, but I question whether I needed the specific education that DigiPen provides or if I could have gotten away with a CS degree from a state university.\n\nBeing in crushing debt is not fun. I'm sure I'll soon be in a job that pays better(Or I'll get enough raises at my current job) and I won't have to worry too much about it, but reducing your debt before you even have it is leagues easier than when you do have it, clearly. \n\nEDIT: Stated my major while attending DigiPen",

You'd be taking a curriculum more similar to RTIS, but instead of making games you'd be making more typical software. Or maybe you find you like the development side of games and not the design side, you could switch to the RTIS program. BSGD is a very flexible program that way. It would be almost trivial to switch during the first semester, and still easy to switch during the second. It becomes more difficult although doable during the second year, but after that unless you take summer classes you'll likely be behind in something by then that isn't easy to make up. ",

So far I am certain that I'm leaning towards studying something relating to Computer Science, my worry lies in the specific direction of Computer Science since it's such a massive field. So if I back out from game design I can still study for a Bachelor's in Computer Science, leaving me with a well rounded education in that field, yes? ",

I should say that our BSCS is more software engineering focused rather than theory focused. Buts it's more general than RTIS. You'll be switching heavy graphics for some classes that teach things like databases, compilers, multithreading  and the like. ",

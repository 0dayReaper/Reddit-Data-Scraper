    "postText": "First of all, what are average ages of the live-on-campus students? I think I'm probably going to be a little older than a lot of students. I'll be at the cusp of 30 by the time the semester actually begins. I'm actually pretty sensitive about both my age and general level of (im)maturity right now. Needing to kick my life in the ass is one of the big reasons I want to attend, but part of my brain is already telling me I'm too old for this. Additionally, being reminded of my age constantly may mess with me.\n\nI have some sort of undiagnosed anxiety/panic disorder, and recently life has not been kind to me so I've been fighting a lot of demons internally. To the degree that I've actually decided that the main condition for me to go is that I'm mentally in a better place, and if that isn't the case then I'll probably wait a year or find an alternative path in life. It would be a matter of not wanting to waste the time of others, on top of me not being a very kind person in the midst of an anxiety attack, and nobody deserves to be around that.\n\nRelated to the above, I've become quite a stoner over the past couple years. Cannabis is very therapeutic for me and actually helps shut the anxiety off and enjoy life. I know people's gut reaction to that is to tell me stop because it's unhealthy to cope that way and that it's a bad treatment for anxiety, so I will just say I feel like it genuinely helps me and that I'm not even sure it is anxiety and not  like a form of PTSD or something. \"Emotional dysregulation\" is the closest description I've read. I mostly say it's anxiety because it's an intuitive way to communicate it with others. Professional help is just out of reach for me, but if it wasn't, I'd probably be trying for a med card lol. (I live in a rec-level legal state btw)\n\nThe actual question I've been meandering towards with the last two paragraphs is ... how is that shit treated culture-wise around campus? Obviously it's going to be \"officially\" against the rules because of federal illegality and I don't plan on doing something stupid like lighting up on campus. It's more of a social question than a literal concrete \"what are the rules\" question I guess, if that made any sense. From my understanding, both Seattle and the game industry in general are pretty 420 friendly, but I also don't actually know that for a fact. The fact that student housing forbids even alcohol kind of raises a red flag for me.\n\nIt's an aspect I can easily change about myself, but I feel like it would be advantageous to start sooner than latter if I need to, which is why I'm asking way ahead of time like this, as brave or stupid as that may be lol. I'd rather not get expelled for, say, having a pot cookie on what precious little free time I'd have.\n\nAnother culture related thing, is I'm probably more open to criticize big tech than most people. I'm very quick to argue in favor of things like banning targeted advertising. And I can be very quick to criticize aspects of the game industry, like the rise of \"release now, patch later\" attitudes and kind of have a rose-tinted outlook on how things were done 20-30 years ago. I don't how well those feelings will be tolerated, no doubt stuff like that is just going to come up in conversation. I'm pretty passionate about all that crap. It'll be good to know before jumping in if I'm just going to be hated and ostracized by default.",

            "comment": "There are no dorms or anything, so no real \"live on campus\" students. Students live in various apartments and things nearby, and the official \"DigiPen Housing\" is just an apartment.\n\nI was at DigiPen 2001-2005, and we had a handful of students who were non-traditionally aged. Had one who was roughly the same age as you are - he did great, graduated, and is still a developer. However, I'd be lying if I said he didn't have to deal with the occasional joke or whatnot about his age.\n\nMentally, I've never bee challenged as much as I was while at DigiPen. The days were longer than anything I'd experienced before or since. The occasional 60-hour work week is one thing, but dP was all consuming and represented nearly every waking moment of my life for 4 years.\n\nCulture wise, at least back when I was in school, drug use was highly discouraged by staff and students. Very few people used anything other than the occasional joint or alcohol at a party on the weekends - and the people who did certainly were at a disadvantage. Simply put - you don't have time or energy to spare on that kind of thing. If you have a medicinal need, then you should work with your doctor so that you aren't just fucked up all the time.\n\nYour feelings of banning targeted advertising or debating the quality level of games that have been released will be welcomed with open arms, at least as much as you're willing to allow yourself to be challenged by other students on similar topics. One of the top 3 reasons you go to DigiPen is because you are going to be surrounded by people who, I promise you, are smarter than you in at least a couple of ways - and who have thought about things in ways you haven't - or from perspectives you don't have. You will not be hated or ostracized for having a contrary view about video games from others - but you might be if you express those views in ways that are mean spirited, violent, condescending, or otherwise.\n\nYour post here has a lot of reasons why you might NOT want to go to DigiPen - so let me go ahead and ask you some questions. Why do you WANT to go to DigiPen? What makes you think you'd be a good fit? What program are you thinking of going into - and have you met with professionals in that industry to ask them what it's like to have that career?",

                    "comment": "I want to go because I've had long term dreams of working in the game industry and moving very far away lol. I'm drawn towards it for many reasons, from the industry doors it may open, to the herculean challenge of the material that I've heard about anecdotally. Even the way the school is structured to mimic the industry is just the coolest idea to me.\n\nI genuinely enjoy college in general on top of all that.\n\nI can be an incredibly hard worker when it comes to school and I appear to have some sort of natural talent for coding. I'm the kid who get's 100% in most programming assignments and ultimately breaks the grading curve for the rest of the class, resulting in me being taken out of that equation ... and that was with a hardass professor who required pages and pages of correctly spelled and grammar'd documentation.\n\nI've taken multiple college programming courses at this point and almost always I end up being highly regarded by both my instructor and fellow students. I know I may be starting to sound like I have my head up my ass, but that's just how school goes for me I guess.\n\nFrom my understanding, DigiPen is not an easy school. And frankly, that's exactly what I would want out of a college. I want to be challenged, because that's when course work is most enjoyable for me.\n\nI'm going into RITS because through my hobbyist escapades I've discovered I'm more of an engine programmer at heart. Instead of working with Unreal, I'd rather fire up Nano and GCC in a terminal and make my own. I know that sounds insane to a lot of people, but that's just my brain I guess.\n\nI have not really talked with any industry professionals, at least not the game industry.  But other programmers I've talked to have been extremely encouraging.\n\nMy view of the industry has been largely informed by a webcomic I used to read as a teenager called The Trenches. Every comic came with a personal IRL horror story about working in the industry. Weirdly enough, it never really discouraged me per se, but it has made me aware that it's not all sunshine and puppies and I more or less accept that.",

                    "comment": "Thanks. I'm cautiously optimistic about my mental health myself right now. It feels like for every 5 good days I'll have one where I just sort of lose it and then everything just \"resets\" and feels hopeless. I suppose I just need to be better about not taking my good days for granted and keep in mind that even a few days is a victory when as recent as two months ago my good days were more or less nonexistent. And before my recent trauma (of which I'll spare everyone the details), I was already on the path to getting better.\n\nI've read a lot about the school over the years, a common thread in more negative/critical comments was always the negative impact the school had on mental health. Something that I've been (perhaps unfairly) dismissive of, partly because I'm well aware how hard programming can be to learn, especially if one has no previous experience. Relating to my previous collegiate endeavors, all too often professors seem to assume some preexisting programming knowledge on the students, which is just a good way to make people feel dumb and give up. But I'll be honest, balancing between keeping a class interesting for more experienced programmers while making the less experienced not feel alienated is probably quite the tightrope act.\n\nThen I'll read other comments, giving high praise to the school's sense of community. How it's not uncommon for students to help other students out, something that I not only don't mind but also genuinely enjoy doing. Helping others solve programming problems or work out a new concept that hasn't fully clicked yet has always given me an unparalleled sense of purpose. To the degree that I almost never finish any of my own personal projects simply because I always find a way to make it a self-imposed challenge and always feel satisfied enough when I have a good understanding of whatever tough concept I was working with.\n\nI feel like my experience at DigiPen could run anywhere from magical and life-changing  to a traumatic mistake due to biting off more than I could chew. But often times reality is an interpolation between the Dream and the Nightmare - so I won't know until I buck up and do it.",

I've been in the BFA program since January. The amount of doubt I felt before enrolling, and still feel, is such a huge, annoying burden that we really shouldn't feel at all. 80% of our classmates might be 18-20, but fuck it, we've been accepted to a top school that's going to train us to become professionals for the career we want to be in. There's no point in thinking about age--everyone else is also struggling to get through these programs and find success.  There's an incredible amount of support among peers that you probably didn't consider--discord chats for our yearly cohorts, classes, everything to find support from all ages--you will not be ostracized. \n\nI hope you find success here or anywhere else.

            "comment": "Hello, I can obviously only give you my experience but in my class(2012) we had a couple of older students in it maybe more. I don't know what their experience was with ageism but I have no doubt that some of it existed. I'd say the best thing you could do would be to try to make friends to work with in the future as the game teams are very much created through who you know at the school. I made friends with a few of the older ones and I personally never saw them as \"too old\" or whatever one might think and they were great to work with.\n\nThere are some students that get housing outside of the actual DigiPen housing which might be something you should consider with the desire for cannabis use just to be  safe when it comes to that. Unless things have changed \"DigiPen Housing\" is just special housing at 1 or more apartment complexes.\n\nOne thing to consider is that there will definitely be a portion of students that have been sheltered and might have more conservative views on things like cannabis use. Getting a place outside of DigiPen housing may get you away from more of those types.\n\nAbout the \"big tech\" and \"release now, patch later\" thing I'm sure you're going to run into a ton of different opinions when it comes to that. You might be more sympathetic once you develop a game if you don't have experience with it. I mean a good portion of it is dictated by management but sometimes you hit a black swan and it's something you just wouldn't have accounted for.\n\nAll this to say, yes, some games are shipped waaay too early.\n\nEDIT: Congrats as well!",

From other things I've read, it sounds like I'd probably fit in just fine (I'm alienated AF in my current situation, so that would actually be a drastic improvement lol). I think I'll plan on abstaining from certain habits while there, as I usually do when my brain is in school mode. And it's weird, maybe just wishful thinking, but I as someone who enjoys being in an academic setting - being in such a setting while surrounded by like-minded yet different enough people would probably be a boon for my mental health and personal growth at the end of the day.",

(This class seems to be the only one that seems to stand out as being there for not much reason) \n\nOn the surface and from what I've read here, it seems as though while there are people that make it work if they haul ass, there seems to be a lot of \"unmotivated\" students in the program or people that are all talk. It seems to have a sort of hit or miss stigma around it, while RTIS and BSGD are generally regarded as the ways to go for CS and then art and animation for art, then sound design for audio etc. It feels like while every degree has a purpose, there's this idea of BAGD being for the \"tune up the graphics on level 5! Hur dur video games\" kids or the \"indie\" social crowd. ",

            "comment": "Edit: To anyone else who reads this, see u/CodeLined s rebutal about why I said things that were wrong :3. At least I tried :(\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me preface: I'm not a major in BAGD. Hell, I'm not even a student at the school (yet, I just got accepted). However, to make sure this wasn't a \"scam school\" (even despite the cons such as huge work load and stuff like that), I did a shit ton of research across everything.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas RTIS is purely programming, and BSCSGD is a combination of programming and design, BAGD is purely game design it looks like. I heard the workload in general is lighter, and even though (IIRC) you touch upon programming, you dont nearly delve into it as much as the actual programming degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI still hear the program is pretty good however, even if some of the classes seem unnecessary (I've heard people compare it to just watching an episode of Extra Credits, go figure one of the guys who worked on the show worked at DigiPen for a bit). Economics is in there because pff, why not. If I had to theorize, its because when your a game designer, you're making game design choices, and one of them could be the decision between microtransactions/dlc or not, and how to properly monetize it, as well as in game currencies and how much this item should be, or that item, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem I've seen and agree with for the BAGD degree is, while its fine you're going into it, a lot of game design principles you can learn simply just through osmosis. Of course, the degree will make you learn more than you would've previously thought, but why not just get a BSCSGD degree if you want that? Because simply put, you're not gonna be designing games in your first year out on the workplace. You're gonna be a simple programmer, and give it some years, maybe you'll be a designer when you're the \"top dog\", calling the shots and all that (unless you go indie, but thats a whole other topic). If you get a degree specifically designed for people at the top of the company, it's gonna take some major skill to land a job like that first time around. Granted, not all game designers are the \"top dogs\", but it seems like they are, and a good game designer I think should know the difference between what is unneccesarily optimistic for a design feature, and what is feasible given the time they have (which is why having programming experience is good, you know how long things will take)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The BSCSGD, while people say it is new and a bit unstructured as of now, is the best degree I think offered at DigiPen, because it offers both an artistic as well as scientific side to game development, and purely because it sounds fun. Like when I was looking at some of the classes in there, they made me giddy just thinking about going to them. Wish I found out about this school earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, not a BAGD student, but that's what I've noticed/believe in. I have a booklet they gave me that could give some more information, but I dont know if you already read it or not (the huge, cool black and blue one that says \"experience matters\"). I can read through that and see what they say in the book when I get home.\n\n\n\n\nPlus, in terms of people being \"unmotivated\", I do think you'll get a lot of those, because it naturally seems easier. But all people have that sort of mentality around a lot of BA degrees like creative writing or philosophy, even though I know from friends and the internet that those degrees can be brutal in terms of homework and research needed to be done. That's not to say that the BAGD students aren't motivated, but just pointing it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                    "comment": "Current Student here! I am not a BAGD either, but I do believe I have a solid comprehension about most of our degrees here (besides CE, BFA and BAMSD). Additionally, my opinion is based on previous experiences from upperclassmen and what I've noticed of the degree in my cohort. Everything I say could be completely invalid whenever the degree changes sequence slightly\n\nBefore I begin, I want to quickly dismiss a point you make about the industry - \n\nBeing a designer is not a top position. An entry level design position is absolutely obtainable and not as impossible as you make it sound. The degree is not designed for \"people at the top of the company\" - it's designed for..well...designers. This is a role that a number of people can fill in a company, not just a boss or what have you.\n\nI highly disagree with the statement that BSGD is the best degree. The BSGD degree is not the best, it's wayy to unbalanced. Maybe one day, but not today. The degree is a weird form of a double major. Your classes treat you like you have infinite time, as they are not created with you in mind. They are created with the respective majors in mind. The CS classes the degree takes are for CS/RTIS/DA students. The GD sequence is for the BAGDs (I have heard through the grapevine that this may be changing eventually. With class sections tailoured more towards the BSGD students). The degree expects you to put in the same time that those students do, and if you don't, you will be penalized for it in the quality of work and the grade you recieve.  \n\nIf you are a student who has extraordinary time management, wants to be both a farily competent programmer and a fairly competent designer - BSGD is a good choice. It will let you be that. Just don't expect you to able to focus on the programming side or the design side, and anticipate jumping onto the five-year program. I personally discovered this through current students before I atteneded and decided to go RTIS with a Game Design minor, thus giving me the ability to focus most of my time into programming and then only take the Game Design classes I wanted to. Generally speaking, I recommend this path for most students who are looking at CSGD.\n\nI realize I probably sound like an ass and that I'm being harsh. That's not my intention. I just want to make sure you and others don't expect one thing and get another :) ",

I've heard a lot of people say that RTIS with a Game Design minor is the better choice, but I wanted more than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I was originally gonna do RTIS, but I got enrolled under BSGD because I was scared about my math capabilites. I knew RTIS was the more extensive option for that, and while I wasn't shit at it (took math all four years, accelerated programs, all that), I wasn't the godly computer science wizz you would expect (always B's, occasionally C's). I originally wanted to go into things like English or creative writing, so I stacked on those credits and just stopped caring about math a good amount (like, I will have 7 credits in english by the time I graduate, lol). I like the idea of the BSGD degree, but from your personal experience, it doesn't sound too good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd its fine if you sounded harsh. I basically told OP \"haha dont do that you're not gonna get a job\", and I did make some assumptions (such as game designers always being the \"top dogs\", I just really never hear of people getting hired in the industry purely as a designer to be honest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough some questions, how much credit hours would I have to take in order to get a game design minor? And do you think someone like me with little computer science experience (I started learning stuff like HTML and Python for this school, basic stuff but still a start) will do good in the RTIS program? I'm getting the basics of coding, and the mathematics are in my genome (mom and dad both have math degrees, dad's actually a programmer), but that's just basics. Thanks for your time.",

Just want to help :)\n\nThe BSGD degree isn't a terrible degree or anything, it's just a lot and I believe students can generally find a better route. \n\nDon't be too worried about Math - especially if you took any sort of accelerated programs. I barely scrapped by pre-calc and failed algebra 2/trig in high school. I'm doing alright, calculus is difficult for me because of my rocky high school math foundation, but I'm studying and getting better as the semesters go along. I was by no means a math wizz and I'm doing fine. It's a lot of math, yes, but professors are extremely helpful and will always be willing to explain things again during office hours. (USE OFFICE HOURS AND TUTORING. I CANNOT REPEAT THIS ENOUGH.)\n\nA Game Design minor requires 17 credits (see: https://www.digipen.edu/minors/), which is roughly an extra class each semester for the RTIS degree. You can use up your open electives for the classes, as well as just take extra courses at no extra cost; You do need a waiver from an advisor to go above 21 credits in a semester, however. Additionally, this is not the maximum game design classes you can take - you said, \"I wanted more than that\"; so do it, and take more electives than are needed/required. The benefit of this is you can take that the GD classes you want to take, not something you don't (i.e  GAT240 - A really broken class that is mandatory for CSGDs). \n\nIn regards to the \"do I need a CS background to do good\" - the answer is a very heavy NO. Not in the slightest. DigiPen does NOT expect incoming students to have any programming experience and will teach you as such. I came in with a decent amount of experience and that served as a slight advantage, however, a friend of mine entered with zero CS knowledge. No HTML. No Python. Nothing. Did he have to do a little bit more studying than me? Probably, yeah - but he is easily just as good as I am, if not better. \n\nLastly - don't panic that you're enrolled as a BSGD. I said similar advice that I did to you to someone else, and they felt like they screwed up since they were enrolled as a BSGD. This is fine - for a bunch of reasons. Both because it's a good place to figure out if you like design more than programming or programming more than design, or maybe like them both equally and decide you can handle and are okay with the intense workload that is the BSGD degree and because generally speaking, if you enter DigiPen as an RTIS student wanting to take GAT classes, you take the same sequence that BSGDs do. The latter is what happened to me, at least. So being a BSGD will have zero impact on your PACE (weird college term for if you're on track to graduate in 4 years) if you do decide to switch to RTIS your second semester. I didn't take Composition my first semester so I could take the GAT classes, this means I will have to take that later in my tenure here. Though, it sounds like you'll probably have credits transfer for that class so that won't be a problem for you.\n\nAny other questions you have feel free to ask me - I can either answer myself, or find someone who can give you better information.\n",

Because the 3D courses need you to have taken GAT250/251 as prerequisites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs GAT330 (Interactive Narrative and Character Creation for Games) a good class to take? Any opinions on it? I know a lot about basic story telling, how to make good characters, basic plot lines, flaws, world building, all that jazz from years of writing stuff as a hobby, but is it justifiable to take considering the game shows how to incorporate those things into a video game, which is a completely different piece of media from books or film? Or should I just stick with my basic knowledge of what I know, which I think I do know a lot, and rely on learning on the job when I get one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all I have.

Coding wise, you mostly lose graphics programming, physics programming, and some of the very advanced stuff like adv. assembly. You still take Data Structures (CS280) and Algorithm Analysis (CS330), which are probably the two most important CS courses in the school.\n\nTaking more than 6 is absolutely overkill if you're not in a GD degree. You really do not want to go over 21 credits/semester, but especially not for the game design (GAT) classes, which are huge time commitments. You can get away with that freshman year if you're good (I know some people have), but later on it's just going to be brutal.\n\nGAT251 is actually 3D game design - the course catalog is wrong because *reasons*. Here's what it looks like:\n\n250: 2D, 2 games around accomplisment, competition, and challenge\n\n251: 3D, 2 games around discovery, sensation, and fantasy\n\n315: 2D or 3D (your choice), 2 games around fellowship, expression, catharsis\n\n(haven't done 316 yet, so this is 2nd hand) 316: 2D or 3D (your choice), 1 game based around being a solid portfolio piece.\n\n250/251/315 are all the same class, basically, with different requirements and a higher bar each time.\n\nI haven't taken 330, because it's elective, but narrative positions for games are really really hard to find, so be aware it may not help you a ton career-wise.",

You can't take a later class without taking the previous class, so its either all or nothing.

It's the experience they get in GAM. The classes won't make you a better programmer. They'll give you broader experience with different things, but they don't fundamentally make you better at solving problems.\n\nThe amount of time you spend actually learning to solve problems in those extra classes for RTIS and BSCS pales in comparison with the time you spend working on your game and game engines. If you were a BSGD and spent as much time as the RTIS and BSCS students working on core game engine features, you will be roughly as good as those students at programming. Sometimes better, sometimes equal, sometimes worse, depending on individuals and removing outliers and all that.\n\nAs for me personally, I prefer working with BSGD students to BAGD students typically, but it's mostly due to time constraints of getting a BAGD fully working well in the team. Integrating scripting, nice editors, and then teaching them the engine can be more work than is seemingly worth it if the BAGD isn't passionate about working in that way. That said, for my last GAM credit next year I'm currently planning on working with at least on BAGD on a custom engine, so there are wonderful BA designers here who are worth doing that extra work for, and feel like we're worth doing their style of work for.",

I think there are several reasons for it, but generally, I wouldn't worry about it. Most of the people who it applies to deserve it, and the good BAGDs are fine - only a few asshats apply it to everyone, and those asshats are, well, asshats.\n\n1) The lack of a filter in the application process. DigiPen's acceptance policy is to take borderline-y people, because they'd rather take too many and fail some of them, than not take someone who would've succeeded if they came here. (also, frankly, because they're a business and like tuition money) For most degrees, those people can self-filter out before they apply. Bad at math, or CS is scary? Don't be an RTIS. Can't draw? Don't be a BFA. But it's much harder to realize you can't design well, because it's much more abstract, so people who really should never set foot here apply and get in, do awful, and fail. Think about it this way: if you were an idiot, but just wanted to work in games because \"it's games!!!11!\", which degree would you go for? No slight to the good BAGDs, what they do is hard, but if you're clueless, it doesn't SEEM that way, unlike CS or art, which display their difficulty prominently.\n\n2) It's also harder to fail out of it - there are less hard roadblock classes. GAT210 and GAT240 weed out a lot of the people who shouldn't be here, but it's still possible to BS your way through them without really \"getting it\", in a way that isn't possible for things like CS and art. The vast majority of people get through those classes by actually learning the material and becoming good designer, but the few who should fail but get through are a big deal when they almost don't exist for other degrees.\n\n3) It's harder to tell you suck at it. Pretentious programmers exist, but they actually have to be good, or they get put in their place very quickly. Pretentious designers can exist at any skill level, because they don't get the same kind of reality check - the net result is more designers who think they're The Best(tm).\n\ntl;dr Good BAGDs are fine and widely respected, but because what they do is so abstract, it's hard to measure, harder to tell if they're good at it, etc. This means that more crap people come to the degree, they can stay longer, and some of them even think they're very good up until it comes crashing down. Those people, unfortunately, end up coloring the degree for some others.",

            "comment": "I am currently enrolled at DigiPen, just not in the BAGD degree; However, I do know many people in the degree and have personally looked at the degree and it's coursework in detail. \n\nTo start - I disagree with /u/AFurryPickle. The BSGD degree is *not* the best degree here at DigiPen. It's a degree that's rather unbalanced, and is essentially a poorly created double major. While the degree will teach you the things you need to know, it does it in a way that's nearly impossible to complete in four years. Nearly everyone in that degree either switches to BAGD, RTIS or to a five-year plan.. The programming classes you attend treat you like a RTIS/raw CS major and the design classes treat you like a BAGD. They expect you to be able to invest most, if not all, of your time into those classes. I have heard through the grapevine things are changing, and for the better. This not to say the degree is a bad degree. It's still a really good choice for people who want to do a bit of both, just don't expect much free time or the ability to dedicate more time to one subject then the other. (Meaning, if you are a CSGD, you have to split your time pretty evenly. It's hard to specialize into a specific half of the degree without drastically impacting the grade of the other half)\n\nOn the topic of BAGD - the degree is generally speaking fairly good. It's the degree for Game Designers. It's the place where you learn design skills, that yes could be learned otherwise, but are taught in a very direct manner. Most of your design classes revolve around making games (first semester, not so much. Second and I believe third semester - board games, then digital). This is one of their primary methods of teaching you design, by making you practice design. Day in, and day out. It's difficult and not for everyone. However, it's important to note that the BAGD degree is where people who think makings games is easy usually end up during the first year. They generally drop out first semester, but some stay around. I also disagree with the other commenter who says to avoid working on teams with programmers. Yes - it's difficult, as you will have to work in their custom engine (though, if they know what they are doing they should implement a scripting engine or something), but it's absolutely worth it. Working with programmers will not only expand your knowledge of programming, but it will also give you more soft skills, particularly the ability to talk about your design ideas to non-designers. If you cannot do that, you won't be able to make it far. Additionally, the only way you can use a non-custom engine is if you work on a BAGD only team which is silly and only limits what you can do as a designer since you will be unable to do anything you cannot program. \n\nYes. The BAGD has that \"idea guy\" stigma. This is, however, not necessarily the fault of the major but the fault of the students. The poor \"idea guy\" designers in the degree are generally the more outgoing people. This is problematic when the good and dedicated designers are too shy to interact with other people. The only opinion non-BAGDs can form is from what they see.\n\nTL;DR - BAGD is a good degree if you want to be a designer, and make yourself useful. If you do nothing but \"turn up the graphics on level 5! Hur dur video games!\" that's all you'll be. If you actually -design- games, and make yourself known, then you'll be a game designer.",

I feel like no matter how much you know about it, the people that have the technical skill to make that happen are the ones that are actually idk doing stuff.\n\nYES. THIS. While it is not a perfect predictor, the willingness to get their hands dirty and technical skill of a BAGD tends to correlate very strongly with how good they are overall. Think about it - if you come to your team with a \"great idea\", how do they know it's great? Who's going to make it? It's very time consuming to implement things, and the time of your programmers is valuable.\n\nThe best designers (generally) don't do that. They pitch an idea, bounce it around a bit, and then they go prototype it. If it's good, the rest of the team can simply see that it is, because it's a real thing now, and not an amorphous idea. More technical designers can also do some/all of the implementation of it in the game, which reduces the burden on the programmers. This makes sense - if you have highly technical programmers, you want them doing highly technical work, not easier implementation.\n\nPut simply, if a BAGD doing the less difficult technical work frees up a programmer to do more of the hard stuff, then that BAGD's net contrubution to tech is huge. A BAGD making prototypes is a great way to filter out ideas that don't work, and to get your team excited and on the same page for the ones that do. \n\nOf course, this is not universal - there are designers with little technical skill who are *fantastic* designers, and there are technical designers who aren't that strong overall, but technical skill is often what makes good designer great, and the lack thereof often makes a good designer meh.",

This is easily one of the best routes to go and highly recommend it. The few BAGDs who do this are generally the better ones, for all the reasons TehBrawlGuy said. With this in mind, as far as I'm aware, it's possible to take the CS degree CS courses in replace of the less in-depth CS courses BAGDs are required to take. If you think you can handle extra workload, I'd recommend this, as it will give you skill above other BAGDs. \nIf you don't think you can handle the extra workload it might be a good idea to look into auditing the class - this will not give you credit for the class  and won't let the class replace the CS classes you have to take as a BAGD, so you would basically taking both. However, it will allow you to sit in on the class, see their assignments and submit them without impact on your GPA. \n\nExample of Benefit: GAT project is due to the same week as a CS assignment is. Since you're auditing the class, you can just not do the CS assignment that week and have no negative impact on your GPA. \n",

The catch with it is that the work is not hard in terms of difficulty, but often is *very* time-consuming, so there ends up being a lot of difficulty in terms of getting your work done in a reasonable timeframe. Relative to other colleges, pretty nuts. One of DigiPen's core policies for every degree is that they're just going to make you do more work to graduate than other schools. It's a brute-force approach to education, but it is very effective if you can deal with it.\n  \n\n&gt;What are your job prospects after graduation?\n\nAgain, this is pretty dependent on what your baseline is. Relative to the CS degrees, not good, because they have near perfect placement rates. Relative to other school's design programs, it's great. The unfortunate reality of the field is that a lot of people want to work as a designer, *especially* in games, and there aren't enough jobs for everyone. DigiPen will give you as good of a shot as anyone anywhere, but do be aware that you're going into a crowded industry.\n \n&gt;How does it stack against other programs?\n\n\nSee above, mostly. If you compare it to other programs at DigiPen, it doesn't stack up that well - partially due to its newness (~8 yrs old), partially due to the lack of a more tangible \"hard skill\" you can use to get employed, and partially because it's harder to apply design outside games than things like art, music, or CS. \n\nIf you compare it to other game design programs at other universities, it's easily top 5 in the country. A lot of other schools have 2-4 year old programs, so DigiPen's was one of the first anywhere.\n \n&gt;How do they contribute to the term projects versus the other degrees?\n\nI went over this in the other post a little, but besides the obvious, lots of prototyping, getting data from playtesters, and user interface/user experience stuff. Most of the producers are BAGDs, and that's a valuable skillset too, but it's definitely not mandatory, and there are plently of non-BAGD producers too.\n\n&gt;How do they usually fare after graduation?\nHard to judge, since the sample is so small. Generally, I've seen them have a little bit of a hard time finding the first job, but most (if not all) of them that I know ended up finding one before too long. A lot don't work in games, especially in video games. I know two people who make analog games/experiences, and two more working at Microsoft on non-games work, although one came there from doing video game design.\n\n&gt;Why is economics in the degree course load? (This class seems to be the only one that seems to stand out as being there for not much reason)\n\nNot sure. I hear my friends in that class complain about it constantly, so I think it's a dud.",

    "postText": "I applied to DigiPen back in 1999 and was admitted, but chose to go somewhere else for college.  A BS in Comp Sci / Theatre and 10+ years later, I'm considering graduate school, and have been looking at DigiPen again.\n\nCan anyone here speak to their Graduate Program?  My primary interest s are in computer networking, cryptography, and server systems.",

There aren't any dedicated classes that you can take for networking or cryptography, but there are options for independent study/thesis work.\n\nYou'll have good chances though to do networking for the game team projects, which probably will be the best reason for coming to DigiPen. Anyway, if you have any questions feel free to message me directly or reply here, either works.",

Keeping up with updating prospective students, I see.\n\nAnyway, like AegisD said, there aren't any courses in those subjects, and few people around here have interest in them. As a game-oriented school, these topics aren't necessary to complete game projects at an academic level.\n\nOn the flip-side, I said necessary. Networking is in high demand. A bunch of game projects utilize network communication for multiplayer. You might be able to squeeze some server systems development out of that too, and make yourself a worthwhile portfolio piece of real-time networking code. You can combo that with an independent study, and get credit in two classes for the same project.",

The server-client model has changed quite a bit, but I'd imagine it would be useful to learn.\n\nI would be interested in talking with an MSCS student if you know any; thank you.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nJust this past week I finished and submitted my application for the Fall 2019 BFA Program. A lot of other schools have deadlines for applications allowing for a set cut-off, but since DigiPen works on a rolling application schedule, does that hurt the chances of people who waited until May+ to submit? I know it's better to submit asap, but this year work has prevented me from being able to finish until recently. \n\nHopefully I'll hear back within the next week or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny ideas on this would settle my nerves quite a bit.",

Having a designer do design on a team while engine programmers do engine programming is extremely satisfying for all involved.\n\nThere are currently something like 17 BSGD students in sophomore year. BAGDs count as developers now, last time I checked. Why would you ever hire a BAGD as an RTIS or BSGD student? They don't know C or C++ and can't contribute to the codebase. They can only work on the game once you have scripting implemented, assuming you *do* end up getting scripting implemented.\n\nI don't mean to shit on BAGDs or anything; many all-BAGD teams make incredible games. Also, sometimes people hire on a BAGD solely because of their art skills, since artists are so impossible to get sophomore year.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, the way the grading rubric is designed, it is generally a bad idea, score-wise, for a team that isn't *just* BAGDs to hire a BAGD. This is how the system is currently designed.\n\nEven so, what do BSGDs and BAGDs know about video game design at this point? They've taken GAT 120, wherein they heard some genuinely good video game design advice from Portnow and Elligner. However, that class also contained Ellinger talking about game design using terminology he made up, and has since changed on his website to a new set of terminology that is largely incompatible with the old one.\n\nMany RTIS students are just as good at video game design as GD students based solely on experience playing video games and critically thinking about how they work. This is why many teams are all-RTIS. BSGDs are seen as just a weaker RTIS who dies every month or so because GAT projects, and BAGDs are seen as relatively useless unless they have art skills.\n\nMeanwhile, RTIS and BSGD know as much about video game programming as BSGD and BAGD know about video game design. The closest thing to learning about programming specifically for video games is CS 230, which is an absolute joke of a class wherein you learn basically nothing. Just as the GD students haven't been taught much about teaching mechanics to the player, guiding the player through the game, making user micro-interactions enjoyable, and so forth, the CS students haven't learned how to make a good frame rate controller, how to do ANYTHING graphics-related with OpenGL or DirectX, how to make an asset pipeline, how to make a component-based engine, how to integrate a scripting language, how to integrate FMOD or FMOD Studio to make a sound system, how to serialize and deserialize data, how to make an editor... the list goes on.\n\nOnce you step back and realize all of this, you start to question what you're actually doing at DigiPen, what you're paying all this money for. In my experience so far, I've had very good elementary CS classes, and everything else has left me hilariously ill-equipped to make the games I'm supposed to have made. If I was coming in fresh with no prior programming or design experience, I don't know what I would do. Everything I've learned about making a video game is something I've had to teach myself out of necessity in GAM 150 and GAM 200.\n\nI learned more about actually programming a video game from the student-run GAM 150 Club than I did from every single class I've taken at DigiPen combined. A student-run club taught me the skills I needed to pass the class and make a decent game because those sophomores knew that none of the classes equip you with that knowledge. How crazy is that?",

(Not going to verify unless you really want to but it shouldn't really matter).\n\nTrying to speak with administration about many of these issues is completely pointless. Just look at how the president's son fucked away half of a semester of my time and money, with no recourse. When approaching Ben Ellinger about issues with the grading rubric for GAM 200 (which was given to use five weeks before it was due), any talk about how adding x, y, and z now-required things to the game is responded to with \"it's not so hard to do x, y, or z.\" Yes, it's not hard to do any of those things individually, that's not what we were asking.\n\nIt is certainly possible to make small-scale change at the school by going through the Councils, but at its core, underneath everything, DigiPen is fundamentally broken, and the administration has its head so far up its ass that that won't change anytime soon.\n\nWe'll see, though. I know for a fact that many of this year's GAM 200 class feedback forms contain less-than-satisfactory responses. I don't know what it is, but many sophomores this year seem to be picking up on the fact that we have all these crazy requirements and deadlines, and we haven't been taught how to do any of them. We have to teach ourselves.",

Is is very similar to last year's rubric that has been up since last fall, so I feel that teams knew what to expect.  There are a few new sections (content creation related mostly) but none of them seem to make or break grades if you are in a half-way decent spot on the project.\n\nWhile their method of springing a new rubric so late in the semester was pretty assy, I am all for the new changes.  Most games at DigiPen are, frankly, shit.  Before this semester I was very subscribed to the whole \"hands off\" experience where we teach our selves and hold our selves to a high standard for games on our own, but after seeing the shit games our cohort made last year I don't blame them for raising the bar on the rubric.\n\nAs far as not being taught anything, welcome to GAM.  If you're not talking about game (anything Comair has attempted to teach), then (as far as my experience goes) asking the professor/department heads for help/understanding/course changes has been very responsive.  If Bede didn't cover something that was on a quiz/homework, he was fine rehashing next class about it.  If Volper didn't explain how to properly implement dynamic programming algorithm, then he would go over it **if you asked him to**.  I find a lot of people's issues would be fixed if they actually asked questions during class instead of playing Brave Frontier.\n\nIn the end, DigiPen isn't for everyone.

You're right, nearly every professor is great at giving feedback and helping you understand things you don't understand in their class. But how can so many people ignore the fact that we just straight-up aren't *taught* anything about making games. GAT teaches you some things like I said, GAT 120 gives you some idea of some broad concepts that are useful in making video games but doesn't give you any practice doing it and indeed doesn't go too deep on any concept, they just broadly go over them. GAT 210-11 is just learning that playtesting things over and over is the key to success. GAT 240 has you making basic games to fill simple rubrics, and this is the most practice designers have had as of semester three as far as implementing game logic goes. Designers haven't learned anything about video game design, but they're told to design a video game.\n\nCS 120 and 170 are probably the best C/C++ classes you could ask for, but you don't know how to make any part of a game by the end of it. That's not entirely true, I guess; it teaches you how to make a basic framerate controller thing and a basic, archaic state machine, both in C, neither in C++, and that's about all the game engine teaching you get.\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE IS SELF-TAUGHT. How is this okay? It's not a matter of being for everyone or not, it's a matter of are you willing to pay a lot of money for some good foundational classes and a lot of stress caused by the school telling you to teach yourself to make a game and make a game at the same time as you are trying to learn how to do the thing you need to know in order to do the thing you need to do to make the game. It's absolutely crazy.",

For way less money, I could enroll at a community college, get admittedly worse basic C/C++ taught to me, and then in my spare time look up how to make a game on the Internet and make it myself or with a group of friends. My stress level would be far less, because I wouldn't *have* to finish the game by deadlines, and I could work on it and teach myself game programming from scratch. If I'm not paying money to be taught how to make a video game, what the hell am I paying for?\n\nThe fact that you don't see the necessity of GAM 150 Club as a problem just proves the DigiPen Stockholm Syndrome Problem. You should never be borderline required to attend an official, student-run club that teaches you everything that you weren't taught by the professor, but are required to know to complete the project you have been assigned. Yes, typically CS/CE projects at other colleges challenge students to put their taught knowledge to the test, to research and experiment and try things, but if DigiPen doesn't teach you how to make video games, why does it exist?\n\nWe're blessed with having a programmer on our GAM 200 team that took CS200 over the summer. That didn't really help them understand how to implement OpenGL or DirectX, but they worked with upperclassmen to teach themselves how to implement one of them in our engine. This is not a trivial task, and never is any part of it taught. Coming into sophomore year, we know vector math and transformation matrices and stuff, but we have no idea how to interface with the GPU via DirectX or OpenGL at all. AT. ALL. How is this not a problem?\n\nIf you're cool with paying a shit-ton of money to be told to teach yourself stuff and stress you out because you have to do it under a time constraint and while taking classes, then yeah, DigiPen is super awesome.",

Again, I don't mean you're necessarily the type of person who engaged in this specific behavior, this is just a metaphor. How can I be \"polluting\" and \"ruining others' experiences\" if I'm just stating facts? If I'm wrong, and I'm spreading misinformation, then yeah, I'm being a dick for trying to deter people from enrolling with no good reason.\n\nWhen I mentioned on the Internet (tumblr, I think) that I was enrolling, I got plenty of messages saying that DigiPen was a scam, etc. It was easy to discount those messages because I knew that DigiPen was a difficult school and many of these people mentioned dropping out after a year, so it was easy to have the opinion that these guys were just idiots who didn't want to do the work. And sure enough, after first and second semester, a bunch of idiots totally did drop out because they were afraid of programming or whatever. But now I see that there are legitimate reasons to drop out, and you basically hit the nail on the head for all of them, except for the last one.\n\nUltimately, if you're truly happy, do whatever you want, man. Maybe you're just fooling yourself into thinking your happy, because you're so used to the bullshit that you've become accustomed to the stench and now you just think of it as normal. If that's cool with you, do what you want.\n\nI just made an imageboard for people to talk about how they feel, and to maybe give people who have this weird feeling that DigiPen is not the super awesome school it was advertised to be, and is instead not unlike a paid beta, at least for the game design programs. A very, very expensive paid beta, with, especially for BAGDs, no guarantee that your degree program is even wanted in the industry at all. If you don't feel that way, that's super cool, but I'd encourage you to do what I did and make a list of all the positive and negative things that you've experienced in your time at DigiPen. My friends were telling me that I was being overly-dramatic or whatever, so I did exactly that. It turns out that, at least for me, someone who doesn't have any college money after this semester, the cons far outweigh the pros. I'm not happy here, and if I'm just teaching myself everything about making a game anyways... after I take this next semester load of CS classes, what more do I need from this school? More stress and bullshit? More professors who are out-of-touch with the students?\n\nI'll just aim for a random local tech industry job (I have contacts at Amazon and Microsoft who say I'm decently hireable), and even though making games and designing user experiences is my most favorite thing in the world, I'll gladly give it up for a 9-5 schedule, 40-hour work week, no DigiPen stress, no DigiPen bullshit... I can't wait. This semester has been hell. College should not be this way.",

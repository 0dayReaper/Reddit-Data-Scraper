    "postText": "I am a high school senior and have been accepted into the BFA program. I'll be living either alone or in student housing, so there is no possible way for me to attend Digipen without working any less than 10 hours per week. 15-20 is more realistic. I also can't afford to do the 5 year plan. I have to graduate in 4 years. However, I'm perfectly willing to take summer classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm concerned because I am well aware of Digipen's workload reputation, and by talking to students, I was told that I could expect 2 hours of work outside of school for each credit hour of instruction. One of them told me that 18 credits was typical, so I could expect anywhere from 36 to 54 hours of course work per week. However, I don't know if that's the standard number of credits, or if that's after already being spread out to include the summer months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny opinions? Personal experience is especially appreciated.",

There are several on campus jobs available such as the store or library. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I can really recommend working while taking a full load though. If you handle time management well, you\u2019ll probably be fine though.",

If it's 18 per semester, then why did he multiply 18 by 3 to find weekly hours of course work, rather than semesterly hours of course work?",

                            "comment": "18 credits per semester is fairly typical for the undergrad; which normally means that many hours of class time per week. A multiplier of 3 for outside of class hours for homework is a fairly reasonable value for challenging courses, which DigiPen is largely. Everything is kinda averages from our own experiences.\n\nSomething that you'll likely face is knowing your personal values to limit the amount of extra time you spend on one project while sacrificing another. This is a balance that you will have to determine where the line is for yourself.",

I (BSCS) have done 17-20. And while that course work estimate is about right, keep in mind also that once you start working on game/film projects, those become endless sinkholes of time. My average was closer to 60-65 hours/week last year (just finished sophomore year). I managed to fit in hours for my TA job, too, so that brought me closer to 70 hours. I did have a couple teammates (a programmer and a designer) that worked off campus ~16 hours/week on weekends, but they would do homework all morning those days and work afternoons/evenings, so their spare time was incredibly sparse.",

Do you think the x3 estimate would still be accurate, for a total of 48 hrs most semesters? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, out of curiosity, what is TA?",

                            "comment": "Generally, yes, that is a reasonable time estimate, but the time investment is variable depending on when projects are due, and some courses will require much more time investment than others, especially if it's a class not in your strong area. In my experience, the general education courses like Communications 150 are 3 credit classes, but have a much lighter work load than, for example, a 3 credit programming class.\n\nThey do update the course sequence every year, so whatever you see online now will indeed be your course sequence. I keep an excel spreadsheet of mine with the classes I want to take as electives filled in.\n\nTA = teaching assistant/teacher's aide, something like that. Not sure entirely what it would entail for an art class, but nearly every class I've taken has had at least 1 TA, who can answer questions, help mentor students, grade assignments, etc. You clock in and get paid whenever you do any of those things, so it's a nice job to weave into your course work, and there are many available. At least in my program, you can start doing it from second semester for classes you've taken in first semester. I'm a TA for the game project class, so my responsibilities are a little more varied, but it's fun to help people and teaching others has been a great way to reinforce my learning. I would highly recommend it as a way to make a little money (pay is less than Seattle's minimum wage) without having to schedule shifts and coordinate leaving campus, while still reinforcing your own learning by focusing on coursework.",

            "comment": "You can. I worked probably an average of 10-15 hours a week through digipen and graduated in 4 years. Here's what you need to ask yourself:\n\nAre you willing to have little to no social life? You're going to need all your open time to do homework.\n\nHow did you do in high school? Are you already used to working and learning simultaneously? I worked more in high school and got a 3.7. I dropped hours entering college and ended up with a 3.1.and tbh, 3.1 is a good GPA for Bfas.\n\nWhat is your game plan if you end up on the 5 year plan? Sometimes it happens. Especially with working students. \"I can't be a 5 year student\" isn't a plan. \n\nWhat is your transportation situation? Where are you going to work? On campus jobs aren't available to first semester freshmen. Bfa TA jobs are competitive. There's hour caps on how much student workers work. If you want to realistically work 20 hours a week, you need to go off campus. And to work off campus realistically, you need a car. Your time is precious at Digi. \n\nYour credit load is realistically 18/semester. There's not all that many classes offered over summer. It's a small school. Some classes, like projects or anatomy, are only offered one semester a year because logistically they can't be offered any other times. \n\nAre you prepared for a weird schedule? As you get higher up at digi, bfa classes run later and later. My first semester I had 5 9ams. Fall senior year I had 4 10pm+ nights. Can where ever you work handle this varied scheduling every 15 weeks? \n\nWhere will you work? Freshman year you can work about anywhere, which is nice. Once you get into the computer stuff, a lot of people can't work anywhere but school. Are you willing to sink 1000+ into a computer for yourself? Maya licenses are free, but photoshop sure isn't. Neither is zbrush of you choose to become a digital sculptor. \n\nWhat is your self care plan? I lived with my parents, so I didn't have to worry about cooking for myself and they were pretty forgiving about me leaving the house a mess. Roommates will not be. You need to make sure you have enough time to cook, clean, SLEEP, and SHOWER. you will fall apart very quickly if you do not. \n\nAlso be aware: financial aid doesn't generally cover summer semester. How do you pay for that out of pocket? \n\nAre you prepared to pay back your loans in a non-best case scenario? Tech artists can make 60,000 a year our of digipen, concept artists cannot. There are students who work for a year before they get an industry job. It's not a knock on digipen - they're making some great changes that will help students to be more successful right out of the gate. But it's a reality you need to be aware of. \n\nHeres what I would do if I were starting again: I'd go get an associates and learn to code. You are so much more valuable as an artist if you understand scripting. Even if you're not a technical artist. Companies start drooling when you put a programming language on your resume, and believe me when I say the class you have to take at digi is not enough to do that.",

                    "comment": "\"How did you do in high school?\" I have an almost perfect GPA and I'm in the top 15% of my class. I've taken a lot of college level/AP classes. Also, I've worked at least one job all 4 years of high school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What is your game plan if you end up on the 5 year plan?\" I guess my plan would be paying off student loans for twice as long as I had planned for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What is your transportation situation? Where are you going to work?\" I own a car, and am comfortable working off campus. I'm sure I will have plenty of options because I have at least 6 months of experience in labor, serving, cooking, and shift lead/management. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"There's not all that many classes offered over summer.\" No big deal, I'll take what I can get. I could always just get summer jobs and work extremely high hours, then budget that money for living expenses during the next school year. It would be a little more stressful, but pretty much the same in the end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Are you prepared for a weird schedule?\" Trust me, I'm used to weird schedules. I can sleep during the day if I have to, and be perfectly functional on as low as 5 hours every night for an extended period of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Once you get into the computer stuff, a lot of people can't work anywhere but school. Are you willing to sink 1000+ into a computer for yourself?\" I already own a $1000 desktop computer with pretty good specs. I might upgrade my GPU some time, but that's it. I also own a drawing tablet, and I've got Photoshop covered. I've been digital painting for a year now, and I've started to experiment with Zbrush lately (on the free trial). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What is your self care plan?\" Depending on what kind of job I can land, I might be able to afford my own studio apartment, so if that's the case, I wouldn't have to worry about conflicts with roommates. As for myself, I can be a bit messy, but make time to clean before it gets too bad, and I cook for myself already most days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Also be aware: financial aid doesn't generally cover summer semester.\" Really? I guess I'll have to look into that. My primary source of financial aid is \\~$20,000/yr for 4 yrs (total of \\~$80,000) from Washington University because my mom works for St. Louis Children's hospital. However, I'm pretty sure they are able to allocate it however I need it to be. Another $4000/yr is from a Pell Grant, and the $1000 is an academic scholarship from my high school for only the 1st year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Are you prepared to pay back your loans in a non-best case scenario?\" That's why I was attracted to Digipen's BFA program, because it has a relatively broad scope. I'd be willing to take any art-related position at any development studio at least at the beginning of my career to pay off loans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI already know a little coding, and I'm sure I will find time to learn more on my own at some point.",

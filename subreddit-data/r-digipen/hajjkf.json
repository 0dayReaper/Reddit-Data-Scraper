    "postText": "I am now 22, but during my high school life had extreme depression and anxiety which caused me to be a C average student. At the time life was merely just a waiting line for death and I completely ignored school and only did just enough to not have to ever go back. Since then I have significantly improved myself and am enrolling in community college for general education in hope that if I work super hard and pump out really good grades and impressive results that digipen may overlook my high school past. I also have a good background in the food industry with baking and pastry and would be able to provide really good portfolio work with self made recipes and the process and thought process behind it. I know digipen tends to really like the creative students for game design degrees and I am confident I can meet that standard if they were to give me that chance. Does anyone know their history of allowing students who had somewhat of a same path as me?",

Took the SAT and got a good score on that and I got in with a good entrance essay. \n\nThey care less about high school GPA and more about proving you can get stuff done and follow through on things to the end. They want you to pay for all 4-5 years after all.",

Then two years at a community college for a design degree, before I finished the degree I applied again. \n\nThe main reason I was accepted was my portfolio, it's a huge factor in the admissions process. While you're at community college, think if you can turn your projects into something for your portfolio. \n\nAnd remember that you'd be a college student with college experience and a catered portfolio. Compared to highschool students and weaker portfolio.\n\nOne big thing is that this school is hard. It will be difficult. If you struggled in high school with putting the work in, that mentality will make any college alot harder. My advice is work on your mentality and your portfolio.",

Most people who've had depression left the program because it was bad for their health. Also as someone formerly in that program, I didn't have depression before entering, just some mild anxiety, but my experience in the BAGD program left me with heavy depression and an anxiety disorder.",

Also the BSCSGD and BFA degrees are better if you're a creative.\n\nFirst off, up until this year's revamp, the BAGD program hasn't had much of a clear focus on what it stood for - unlike other programs, where you basically get what you expected/came for. Most students who enrolled in the past did so because they pursued narrative/narrative design and that's what the program seemed to promise, but didn't deliver.\n\nSecond, the workload. Unlike other degrees, where you're able to take the occasional healthy break and spend some much needed time with friends (movie nights, sleepovers, etc), there's just no time to do so in the BAGD program, and that results in poor mental health.\n\nBut as for why it left me with anxiety and depression, that came down to the program director. Staying on and graduating simply comes down to if he likes you or not, since you're required to take a lot of classes with him.\n\nClearly, he didn't like me. I met with him for questions I had about the lecture or going in for help, as responsible students do, but all he did was use those meetings to subject me to verbal and emotional abuse - and went out of his way to bully me in class (assignment critiques, exam scores, etc). So at the end of all that, he had gaslighted me into a mindset not much different than your high school years.\n\nThat aside, I ended up transferring to the BFA degree a year later, and it's been much better in terms of creativity and my own goals.",

    "postText": "So I was recently accepted into DigiPen's BFA program (yay!) and my final hurdle is getting my finances together.  I know it's going to end up being a lot of scholarships and loans no matter what I do, but every little bit helps and I was hoping to have a part-time job while attending to help cover things like food.  \n\nEverything I've heard says that taking on a part-time job off-campus is a bad plan, so I was wondering if anyone on here had experience with on-campus jobs and had any advice on whether it's a good idea, how much it pays, etc. The job portal hasn't been super helpful beyond letting me know what kind of jobs are available (which, while a good start, is less helpful in planning a budget).  The alumni panel at open house mentioned that most on-campus jobs are four hours a week, which while helpful for classes, seems a little less than ideal (although something like twenty hours a week would definitely be impossible to keep up with).  \n\nI just want to know whether it's worth it to have a job at the school like that or if I should just focus on applying for scholarships and loans so I can dedicate all my time during the year to school.  Any advice is appreciated.",

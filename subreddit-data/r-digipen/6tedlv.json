My question is about the application essays.\n\nWhat is digipen looking for besides what they wrote in their site? By that I mean length and depth of answers. \n\nWhat do you think helped you make it into the college? \n\nFinally, how high is the acceptance rates for the college? \n\nThank you in advance for any answers helpful or otherwise. Look forward to working with you all someday!",

As far as acceptance, it varies by degree as they have individual acceptance rates (which I don't know) but I remember the average was around a 46% ish acceptance rate.",

If you have done any personal projects you can put it in the essays. They are mainly looking for a show of passion and the ability to pass through this school. do your best to display your ability to not only be able to know the material but also be able to handle the workload. And as far as the accelerated masters program, that wouldn't be a problem at all. Once you get accepted, you will be assigned a Student Success Advisor (SSA) who will help you with class schedules and other stuff for graduation. If you talk to them, they will tell you what you need to do for that. As far as I know you don't need to reapply, just have to take some additional classes. ",

Why you want to go to DigiPen for that degree specifically, and what it offers that other colleges cant (however dont shit talk other colleges, that's a big no no for a lot of applications in general). As far as length, I asked and they said \"if you get your point across in one page or ten, we don't care, but get it across nice and efficently.\" For me, that took around six pages, double spaced. For others, it might take less or more. Just start writing and see where you end up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also had some good stats on my application. I didnt have too many extracurriculars, and other than grades (around 3.2 gpa, which is an average gpa for the school, if a bit on the low side, and a 31 act, which is higher than the average of 26 IIRC), I had a lot of AP classes, which showed my determination for academics and challenging myself, which DigiPen especially will love to see. I even took a class where you do an entire research project on your own, with little help. That really helped since DigiPen has its game team projects, which work in a similar way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, acceptance rate is around 50% from what I can recall. It's not that its a hard school to get into perse; as long as you didnt majorly screw up high school, and show passion towards your degree, you'll do absolutely fine. But moreso that people come in thinking its really easy to make games, and might say stuff like \"I wanna make games cause I like playing them\". Its not really wrong, but thats the wrong expectation that leads to a 50% drop out rate first year. People think its easy but it really aint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR is, it's not hard to get in, as long as you show you understand what it takes to make games, what has prepared you to go to the school, and why your passionate towards video game development in particular with your degree path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Also, always do optional essays. I did mine. It shows you put more time and effort into it, and are thus more willing to go.",

Some of what you said was great in making me feel like I can make it in for sure, some of it made me think I was a dummy for not applying myself in high school more. I will take all of this in and definitely give it my best shot with the essay. \n\nThank you again!",

I dont think you are really supposed to install programs on the lab computers though.\n\nAs for bringing a laptop and plugging into the desktop displays, maybe? I use a laptop myself but Digipen is rather against letting non IT people mess with their hardware. For something simple like a monitor you might be able to talk to some IT people and figure it out, just don't rely on that happening.\n\nEdit: Also I guess I should mention that after your freshman year, for collaborating on game team projects, each team receives a nice Digipen hosted git repository.",

            "comment": "&gt;Can they remotely access their file share?\n\nYes, through [https://den.digipen.edu/](https://den.digipen.edu/), although it's worth noting that upload/download speeds aren't great. It's fairly common for people to carry around a USB drive for all their personal assignments and copy the file to the computer's desktop, edit, then copy it back. I personally stopped using the school's servers after a semester or so, and just had a flash drive on my house key ring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are students able to install programs on the lab computers?\n\nSome programs will install without an admin password, and for ones that do need a password, you'll need to justify why you need that program to do work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If there is no good solution, it seems like a laptop would save a lot of headaches.\n\nThis is true. A lot of people who have laptops opt to use those over the school's computers for the reasons you're asking about. Some upperclassmen will also move their desktops to their space at school so they have total control over their workstation. It's also really easy to connect to the printers and servers when you're on the school's wifi/LAN, so going between the two is possible, as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If you bring a laptop are you allowed to plug in to the larger desktop displays?\n\nI'm not sure how IT feels about this, but it is possible and I've seen people request a school desktop for their personal space just to get the monitor. IIRC, the cords the school uses are DVI and not HDMI, though.",

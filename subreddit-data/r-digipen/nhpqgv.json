            "comment": "Hello, when I attended I started out with a laptop I had specifically purchased for DigiPen and about half-way through I needed something a bit more powerful. I initially bought a custom laptop from Cyberpower and then bought a Dell XPS laptop later on.\n\nI very recently got rid of that dell laptop. The battery was basically shot on it but it lasted the rest of my time at DigiPen and then some.\n\nI started in 2012 though so I don't know the quality of Dells now. I would avoid Alienware though, those are usually overpriced.\n\nUnless he really wants it he'll probably be fine with 15in screen versus a 17in. 17 is pretty big for a laptop anyway.\n\nMore ram is usually good for work with game dev tools as well. Ideally 16GB if you can. dev tools can suck down a lot of ram for editors and whatnot.\n\nI know DigiPen students can now work in Unreal Engine 4 at least from Junior year on so it wouldn't be a bad idea to look at the specs for that editor as well to see what they require [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Basics/RecommendedSpecifications/index.html).",

            "comment": "Hello, I assume your 12 hour callout is just arbitrary as typically each college credit has multiple hours associated with it for school work. Usually it's like 2-3 hours or something like that. By no means does that mean your work will always be 2-3 hours long per college credit but sometimes it could be longer. Anyway, I'm getting into the weeds here.\n\nLet's get back to what you're asking. Yes, there are actually quite a few students who do a 5 year program with DigiPen degrees.\n\nKeep in mind of the DigiPen graduation requirements: ([https://www.digipen.edu/student-portal/student-services/registration/graduation-requirements](https://www.digipen.edu/student-portal/student-services/registration/graduation-requirements))EDIT: Removed previous comment due to TehBrawlGuy's response.\n\nOne thing to consider for summer courses is that not all courses are available over the summer. It's typically limited to what students need to redo over the summer to line back up with their next fall semester.\n\nThat's another thing to consider as well. Typically the classes lead into one another so there is a specific sequence of classes you need to take so you don't end up without a class because it's only available in the fall or spring semesters. Someone at the school will help you line that stuff up when you mention you want to do a 5 year program.\n\nOne last thing to consider. It's tough to get a job as a pure designer coming directly out of school. Be prepared to work your ass off at DigiPen and even then it may take a ton of applications to get your foot in the door at a company. Sometimes you might have to take a step back to pay the bills as well. I know I had to in the beginning.\n\nTypically at the start designers don't get paid very well either. So your loans might be really painful if you're planning to finance your entire time at DigiPen. (I financed all my DigiPen experience and the first couple of years after graduating were awful financially)\n\nFeel free to ask more questions. I graduated in 2012 as a BSGD and have been working in the industry ever since.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: The amount of credits you take per semester also affects your eligibility for loans and such too ([https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/financial-aid/how-to-apply-for-financial-aid](https://www.digipen.edu/admissions/financial-aid/how-to-apply-for-financial-aid))",

My situation is a bit different than many students\u2019-I am very fortunate that finances don\u2019t have to play a role in my decisions about school, I like school, and I really like spending the time diving deep into any class I take. That said, if you knew then what you know now, what would be the ideal roadmap you\u2019d set for yourself as you head to Digipen? What would you do? What wouldn\u2019t you do? What do you wish someone told you??\nThanks again.",

                            "comment": "That's great to hear. Then there are no worries about attending DigiPen in that regard!\n\n**What would you do?**\n\nI think what I did at DigiPen did well for me. I got into a study group early into attending the school and made friends with those people. I stuck with that study group for most of my time at DigiPen and it lead to working on game projects with people in that study group.\n\nSo, I'd suggest getting into a study group if you can find one and make friends. You'll be able to help each other and it might develop into a game team!\n\nThe 4 years I was at DigiPen were spent just focused on going to DigiPen I had very little free time and mainly just went to school and worked and then went home to sleep. I was at the school most days from the time it opened to when it closed. Obviously that wasn't every day but I did it quite often. Given your plans this obviously isn't an absolute necessity, just something you may have to do depending on the classes you're in and how your game team works.\n\nWhen we made our game for junior year instead of trying to win an award we decided to just make a fun game. We wanted to focus on making something people enjoyed which can be a different direction than winning an award. Be sure to get those motivations figured out before making the game otherwise you might have some conflict down the line on what is best for development of that game.\n\n**What wouldn't you do?**\n\nI had to drive to school which might have been something I would have changed if I had the ability to do so. I was living with a buddy of mine so I think the location we lived at was better with both of us living together. It would have been nice to be able to just walk to school.\n\n**What I wish someone told me?**\n\nThis isn't exactly something that is \"hidden\" but something I didn't realize until getting into the industry is that most game studios have different expectations on what a designer does. Some have nuanced levels of designers but even within that nuance they can have wildly different expectations of what they expect you to be doing. Some want you to program stuff, others want you to jump into Maya and build temp models while others expect you to fully write gameplay systems. It's all over the board and you can glean some of that from the job description but sometimes you won't until you talk to the recruiter or someone at the company.\n\nSometimes you have to take a step back to move forward as well. I was laid off from my first design job along with the rest of the team and eventually the company laid off everyone. To pay the bills I had to get a QA job which taught me a bit about testing which can be helpful as a designer or any dev really as it informs you how QA works and what sort of info they have on their end.\n\nAlong with what I said earlier about DigiPen game development. Be sure to make the game you want to make or some form of it. It might be a while before you have the ability to make something completely of your own design when you get into the industry. Unless you go indie.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",

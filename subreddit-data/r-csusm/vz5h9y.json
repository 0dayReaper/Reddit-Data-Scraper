    "postText": "Hello!\n\nLast year I was able to receive Cal Grant B, State University Grant, and the Federal Pell Grant, but this year I only get Cal Grant B access and tuition. \n\nDoes anyone know why I do not have both the Federal Pell Grant and State Uni Grant for my upcoming sophomore year?\n\nThe only reason I could think of is that I had an income the year prior and had to report it; this probably made my EFC go up? I am not sure, I am very new to all of this still and need help\n\nThank you for your time!",

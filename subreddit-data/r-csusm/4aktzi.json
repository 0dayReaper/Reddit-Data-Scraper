I haven't lived in San Diego for very long and really know nothing about San Marcos, I'm not even totally sure where it is lol. So basically what is it like? I have a lot of anxiety so I was hoping for a school that's more relaxed and not so competitive, is San Marcos a good choice? ",

            "comment": "I'm graduating in two months as a CIS major. While my experience has so much breadth that it'd take an essay to describe everything, I'd summarize as briefly as possible the following:\n\n**PROS**\n\n- The newest facilities, such as the USU and Markstein buildings, are pretty and pleasant to spend time in. \n- The campus is kept very clean. It makes the experience of being on campus much better. \n- Traffic and parking haven't been as much of an issue as I was expecting. \n- Tuition is more reasonable than most colleges. \n- The campus feels very safe and relaxing. There isn't a ton of noise, any sense of danger, or annoyances that disrupt study. \n- There are a lot of good people at CSUSM. This can be said of any college (probably), but it's worth mentioning. I've met some tremendously good people during my time here. \n- There's phenomenal diversity here. There's people of all races and creeds, and as far as I can tell we all get along. It's worth mentioning that there are lots of good looking people at CSUSM, too. I don't think I've been to a place with a higher density of beautiful people before. \n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\n- CSUSM is a quiet social experience. I've made several amazing friends during my stay here, but I'm one of  large number of commuters who attend the school.  Many commuters like myself don't really participate in the culture of the school, or events. As such, this school may not be for you if you are into large group gatherings and parties. That said, both of these things are to be found, just in smaller quantity than many competing colleges. \n- Stairs. There are so many stairs at CSUSM. As an active person I love it, but if you hate stairs, then you might want to go elsewhere. \n\n**CONS**\n\n- There's a huge deviation in the quality of professors. I've had a small handful of professors who were helpful, thoughtful, and most importantly interested in the success of students. However, most of my professors have been very poor in quality in numerous ways. Even as a honors student I've always felt like most of the professors are just showing up for a paycheck and completely disinterested in the growth of students. \n- Parking pass prices are out of this world. I have a suspicion that administration tries to offset the less-than-average funding for the school with $600+/year parking passes. \n- This school hasn't yet built a strong reputation. If you want to find a great job after graduating, you better network. This isn't Harvard. \n- The sport scene at CSUSM is low tier. There are talented athletes at the school, but it won't even have its own arena until after I graduate. Judging by the recent successes of teams and the upcoming arena I have a feeling it'll get much better, but I can only comment on my personal experience. \n- A lot of my classes haven't done a good job of relating to the real world (I have 7 years work experience in IT and management). This is a common issue at colleges, made worse at CSUSM by some of its low effort teachers. I scratch my head often when taking classes when I see the topics that we're learning. \n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck!",

This is my second semester there, and one thing that pisses me off is when you see one person occupying a whole study room just eating their food there and watching their fucking drama shows. Happened to me last week and my partner and I told her I had the room reserved and the bitch gave me this mean glare like I disturbed her fat ass from watching her show. Sorry this turned out to be a rant.",

We have lounges.\n\nAlso, my trick for avoiding all the people: Check classrooms and chill in the empty ones. I usually find good classrooms most times of the day in academic or the arts building. Makes for a great study spot and you never get bothered. Oh and if you like the quiet outside, check out the first floor of Sci 2, go past the elevator and down the walkway and you will find a nice grassy area with a tree. I've never seen anyone hang out there other than myself on occasion. Hope that helps :)",

One big plus is if you like beer there are a ton of great breweries in the area, something that I have always enjoyed.  I had a great time living here in San Marcos, but it is definitely not where I want to plant my roots.",

Can you tell me what you *didn't* like? From what I've been gathering, Sociology is less of an applied science than Psych, right? Meaning, I see all these lab &amp; research requirements for the Psy program in the catalog, but not so much for Soc -- is this correct? How about fellow students: can you comment on how friendly others were -- were you able to form bonds/friendships? \n\nLastly, as this is probably a silly question, but bare with me, I've taken several Psy courses in community college, and well, the demographics are heavily female, by at least 3:1 -- is it the same for the behavioral sciences in CSUSM? Is it kinda awkward for males? Lol, sorry, it's just that.. I'm anxious type of guy, and I find it more stressful talking to, well, the opposite sex.",

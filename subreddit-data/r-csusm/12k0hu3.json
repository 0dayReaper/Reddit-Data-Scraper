They sent me an email that I\u2019m on the waitlist and that in order to remain on the waitlist I would have to choose an alternate major but they also said in that email that they check the waitlist every week\u2026 so maybe that indicates that I might have a chance please let me know I would really appreciate it",

I tried to contact them and ask but they are not answering me so I sent them an email to CEHHS so hopefully they will get back to me soon??? I have a 3.82 gpa with an 85 score for the TEAS exam and 3.9 for prenursing core courses ??? Does that matter in where I am placed on the waitlist?? Do the majority of the people who get on the waitlist get in?? Like ugh I\u2019m so stressed about it\u2026 pls let me know",

Yeah it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask what your waitlist position is or at least what the minimum score was required to get into the program so you can kinda calculate your waitlist position.",

I haven't checked data for applicants for TBSN, but 40 pts was around average for people who were accepted into ABSN for the last 4 rounds. Maybe this cycle was just super competitive.",

    "postText": "There is alot of chatter on the SDSU sub that is somewhat concerning.  Issues include classes not being available, professors that should be teaching a class gets switched out for another professor, and other negative complaints.\n\nI am wondering if this sub here @ CSUSM is just normally quite or there is no issues regarding the number of classes being offered compared to the number of students that might need that particular class.  OR, just no issues at all?\n\nMIS,IS, and even CS students speak up! I, and im sure others would love feedback regarding this schools program\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you as always",

The issue right now could be a shuffle of professors or the lack of, maybe a by product of Covid.  Maybe in a year or so it should be ok.  I dont remembering people having an issue like they are now a couple years ago.",

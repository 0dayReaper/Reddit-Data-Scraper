I've tried to figure out what it entails, tho, beyond possibly being disqualified for financial aid this semester, but the website doesn't actually include any details of what it means to be on probation. Do I have to take a reduced workload? Is there any possibility of getting financial aid at all? Any information would be helpful, I'd appreciate it.",

You may still be able to get financial aid if you complete an appeal process or sign a contract promising to improve your grades. I would dig into the fine print! Or call the financial aid office, the people there seem friendly.",

In my case, that required a letter to the higher-ups explaining my situation, what I'm doing to improve, and how I'm going to do better in the future.\n\nThis makes me sound bad, but I've been put on academic probation 4 times. The 3 times I petitioned to be taken off, a one-page letter was all it took, even though my excuse and steps to improve were always the same. I think they just want to weed out people who don't care enough to petition or not.\n\nI don't know about the financial aid part. Sorry. You're pretty much guaranteed missing a semester because of the probation though unless you're super on top of things.",

In the second paragraph, go into detail about what caused your grades to plummet. Death in the family, health problems, lost class time due to COVID, had to work overtime to make ends meet, whatever dragged you down. Then start another paragraph and explain what you're doing to improve. You've gotten your vaccines, your car is repaired, you're going to therapy, you're seeing a doctor, you're looking into getting a tutor, you're applying for disabled services, whatever. This is where I info dumped because I had a LOT go wrong with me health-wise. Finish up by emphasizing how much you are going to try and do better if you're reinstated. Really sell that you have the drive to succeed. Tell them what you love about your major and gush about what a great [insert career here] you can be of you're given a second chance.\n\nThank them again and sign your name. You'll have to figure out where to send it on that horror story of a website.\n\nGood luck. Mine wound up being between a full page and one and a half pages, so nothing too long.",

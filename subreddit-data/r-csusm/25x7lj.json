Every time they release an update,  it counts as a new product key, which is nice. I'm now (legally) dual-booting two copies of W7 on both my MacBook Pro and iMac",

Bunch of my nursing apps only run on Windows.\n\nThis is also a huge upgrade from Vista IMO, if you're still running.\n\nOf course, always backup before you perform an OS install! Clean installs (starting from scratch) are also preferable over upgrade installs.",

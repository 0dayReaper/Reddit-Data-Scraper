Near the game room? \n\nI graduated in 2019, so I don\u2019t know if they moved stuff around.\n\nUsually you can reserve those and it\u2019s a quiet space, they have bean bags and stuff like that. I forsure took advantage of those and sleep there. \n\nEven utilizing the markstein rooms or study rooms, I would just nap on the table loo",

They are almost like patio couches, I took a nap on one today. \n\nThere is also a commuter\u2019s lounge in the USU building but I\u2019ve never been there so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s in it.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that the seating outside of the food building is pretty busy so I would try to pick a time when people are heading to class if possible.",

    "postText": "This shit is fucking ridiculous! It is clunky, outdated, and hides assignments and important information page after page. Coming from using Canvas this shit looks straight out of 2005. How fucking difficult is it to use the cost of our tuition to pay for a service that is streamlined and actually works rather than create your own and you can't even get the FUCKING CALENDER to work. God Dammit we pay so much fucking money when a fucking community college 15 minutes down the road were smart enough to just use the money to pay for something so their students can actually use something functional.",

I have a professor that is always switching up when assignments are due and my life would be so much easier if I could track it with a calendar. Also, the schools website in general is horrible. I always switch to \u201cmodern view\u201d because without it it looks like a government website from 1995.",

I just graduated and honestly no one seemed to have any problems with CC *until* the calendar was removed, now every student I talk to just has this immense rage for the whole site. \n\nThis settles it though. I didn\u2019t know it had gotten this bad. I\u2019m going to talk with the right people in IITS next week and discuss what we can do. \n\nConsider your complaint heard \ud83e\udd1d",

And the only feature that sort of helps is the calendar, but of course that\u2019s down. Seriously is there anyone we can complain to? I would do anything to use Canvas instead",

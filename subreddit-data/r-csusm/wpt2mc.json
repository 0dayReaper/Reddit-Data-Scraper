I used Canvas in community college and most profs would have their courses published a few days before their class starts, but it can be as late as the morning *of*. Some profs are awesome and will publish a week before! It's similar to Cougar Courses in that way. If you log into Canvas now, click on \"courses\" on the left and click on \"all courses\". You'll see a list of future enrollments which will give you peace of mind when you are waiting on courses to publish. Some students worry that they've been dropped from a class when they don't see their courses published, but you should be fine if you see all of them there. Hope that helps!",

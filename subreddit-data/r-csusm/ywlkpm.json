    "postText": "About two weeks ago I submitted my application to the Quad housing for Spring 2023 (I\u2019m transferring to CSUSM from NorCal) and I was put on the waitlist, and I haven\u2019t heard anything since. Does anyone knowthe likelihood that I will get accepted into the dorms? (I applied for the Quadruples and Triples). I\u2019m not quite sure if I have a good chance of getting in, or if I should be looking for other housing accommodations. I called the housing, and they said it\u2019s based on the amount of people that pull out from living in the dorms. I\u2019ve read of people that have gotten calls a few days after they submitted their applications, but I haven\u2019t heard back from anyone. I would much rather live in the dorms, but I don\u2019t want to wait until the last minute hoping to get into Quad,  and then have to scramble at the last second to find a place to stay. Any insight or help would be greatly appreciated!!!",

Also, make sure you know which phone number you gave them on your application. Last year I called to check on my daughters application and they said they tried to call, so make sure you answer any calls from 760 area code. I would say keep calling them to check until they assign you housing, there seems to be no logical order in how they assign housing. You can also join student housing groups on insta, that is what my daughter did to find off campus roommates.",

However, when they first called me to tell me i was waitlisted they said they were hoping to make calls from late November to December.",

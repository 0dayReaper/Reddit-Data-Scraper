    "postText": "I got an offer from CSUSM to transfer in Spring 2023.  I'm pretty sure I want to commit here instead of the other colleges I was offered admission to. However, the area would be completely new to me and about an hour and a half away from home/family so I would be living on campus.\n\nI am fairly introverted in new situations so I am a bit anxious about making new friends and being in a new environment. I have a couple of clubs and sports im interested in joining but If anyone else is thinking about or have committed to CSUSM I would love to connect and possibly meet up once school starts. \n\nI'm very excited to explore the area and start school (I know sounds crazy lol). But if anyone who currently goes here has any advice for meeting new people, the area, the sociology department, or things to do, please share! \n\nThanks!",

What do you love most about the area? \n\nI'm not far away but it will be a considerable commute time so I decided to just go with on campus housing for the time being. \n\nAlso, which dorms did you choose to live in? I'm considering UVA over the Quads",

Where I came from was pretty boring, there was pretty much nothing going on ever and nowhere to go. Whereas here in SD county, there's so much to do, you'll never run out of places to explore and events to attend. \n\nI live in the UVA! It's cheaper, and I liked that there was a studio dorm option... so you're not forced to have roommates if you don't want them. It is an older building, but honestly it's nice. I have had no problems with the building/area itself. And it's also really close to the train station! I took the train to Oceanside today and had a day at the beach, it's literally just around the corner from the UVA. \n\nOverall, it's a pretty beautiful experience if you make the most of it!",

I also am from an area that doesn't have much to do or many food options so having a surplus of things to do will definitely help me get accustomed to things. \n\nWere you able to secure a UVA studio? I really want to apply for one but heard they can be hard to come by? \n\nAw I'm so jealous that you were able to have a day at the beach today! I technically live in a low desert so I spent the day indoors with the AC on lol. Beach days for me typically require planning and at least an hour drive at the moment. I'm so looking forward to spontaneous beach trips!",

Oh yeah for sure, you won't run out of things to do here!\n\nI did get a studio! Actually, it was like a day or two after I applied. I got an email telling me to sign for a studio and I signed instantly, because I too had read that they were hard to come by. But it sure came easily to me - not entirely sure why. I was thinking maybe it's a marketing thing to create a sense of urgency? (I'm a marketing major so that's where my mind goes, haha). Or maybe they really are in short supply and I just got lucky \ud83e\udd37 Either way, I think they assign housing based on what's available at the time they get to you on their list. So if there is a studio available when they get to your application, you'd be offered it. \n\nHaha! Yeah that heat can be rough. Before I left home it was 110 Fahrenheit outside - so I get you there. It's been so nice here. I haven't had to think about any heat once, it's just perfect everyday :)",

The beach is close as well to Oceanside or any of the other SD beaches. As for SD, downtown is where it's at, Pacific Beach, etc. Balboa park is also a nice spot, if you're into Asian cuisine then clairemont is where it's at a lot of Asian food options in that area.",

    "postText": "I don't know about everyone else, but I know I'm feeling nervous yet energized for my senior year! \n\nI'm thinking about all of the transfer students who are starting their first semester at CSUSM (welcome!). I'm thinking of the parents and primary caregivers who are balancing their family life, work, *and* school to make their dreams come true (y'all are my heroes!). To all of the non-traditional students who may worry or feel like they are out of place on campus -- I see you (I'm one of you) and you **absolutely** belong! To anyone who worries about making friends, finding their classes, getting through the first week, and everything in between -- you seriously got this! Some of those things take time and patience. To everyone else, best of luck this fall!\n\nHere are a couple of helpful links for those who are unfamiliar with CSUSM:\n\n\\- [If you are experiencing food insecurity (cannot afford food or short on cash this week/month/year), drop by the **ASI Food Pantry** for free food to take home.](https://www.csusm.edu/asi/pantry/index.html)\n\n\\- [If you need someone to talk to, reach out to the **Counseling Services dept**. Your issue is not too small nor too big -- **you matter**!](https://www.csusm.edu/counseling/index.html)\n\n \\- [A list of all of the **student organizations** on campus.](https://www.csusm.edu/orgs/)\n\n\\- [**Other student resources** that may be of interest to you](https://www.csusm.edu/students/).\n\nI hope all of your classes are exciting and successful. Don't forget to go to office hours -- your profs are literally waiting for you! Most of them are chill. \n\nDo your best and have fun!",

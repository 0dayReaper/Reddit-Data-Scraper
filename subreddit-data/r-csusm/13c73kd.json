    "postText": "Hello all,\n\n I got a notification from CSUSM saying my financial aid was updated - when I checked for the year 2023/2024 I was awarded a Pell grant and Cal Grant B (access and tuition). \n\nHowever, when I check the cal grant website it states I was not awarded a cal grant b. Should I submit an appeal or is there another way to resolve this? \n\nI believe it is in error as on the cal grant website it doesn\u2019t state a reason for not being awarded. Any input is appreciated",

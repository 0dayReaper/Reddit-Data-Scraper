    "postText": "Just a heads up to all you cougars that the middle class scholarship is finally being reflected on all cougar portal accounts under student center. If you\u2019re eligible to receive the MCS, and are enrolled in direct deposit you should see it reflect in your checking accounts in 2-3 business days. If you\u2019re not enrolled for direct deposit, expect a check in the mail in 14 business days. Hope this helps. Have a great Spring semester cougars!",

CSUSM may deduct from your award if you owe money for spring tuition. If not then it\u2019s your money to use as you\u2019d like.",

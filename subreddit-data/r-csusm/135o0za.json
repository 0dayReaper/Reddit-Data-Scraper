I am 100% vaccinated with all the vaccines that have show to stop transmission of the disease they are designed for.  Im not anti vax...Im anti the government forcing me to take something that has been shown to be ineffective against the spread of the disease, that has no studies on long term effect and to this day is producing negative side effects.   There are no studies that have yet shown that vaccine is effective against the spread.  Why would I allow the government to force me to put something in my body that has a higher risk of negative side effects.  The vaccine HAS shown that it can make symptoms less harsh...so if you are afraid of getting super sick, then take it.",

You have no answer other than \"someday Im gonna be a doctor so Im right\".   Nothing flat earth about my question.  simply wondering why we are still requiring vaccines when, quite literally, the rest of the plant appears to now be backing away from vaccine mandates...even your ridiculous, dementia lead, ultra left wing federal government just declared an end to the pandemic and is no longer requiring federal employees or contractors to be vaccinated.  Yet a california state campus that is 90% populated with the lowest risk demographic (healthy 20 year olds) is still trying to force the issue.",

Call it what you want, keep your head in the sand and let assholes take advantage of you...I don't care. I'm not discussing policy or the need for vaccines in a certain places, of course there's some nuance there. I'm pushing back against all the factually incorrect propaganda that you are using to reach your conclusion. You have a lot of arrogance and confidence with zero real knowledge and it's concerning that you aren't ashamed of, or seemingly aware of, that fact.

I read on the CSU website that the mandate was over, but there is a loophole to the decision...individual campus presidents can make their own call.  I have NOT see anything on CSUSMs site that is recent.  Do you really think they will loosen the mandate come this Fall?",

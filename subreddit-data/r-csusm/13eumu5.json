I just called to get an update on my housing application and they said I\u2019m on a waitlist since I\u2019m not a first year student. I\u2019m a junior transfer.  How likely is it that I get off the waitlist? What are other options for housing? I\u2019m even open to off campus housing. Any advice would be great!",

So you should prepared to never have a space open ig",

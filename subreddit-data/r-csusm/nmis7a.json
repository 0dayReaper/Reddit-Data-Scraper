The union overall is a good thing, but letting him stay is absolutely fucked, and I'm shocked they're defending him over consistent and obvious transgressions that are insanely unprofessional to say the least. Ironic and sad he's in a business school.",

I can\u2019t blame the union any more than I can blame a criminal defense attorney. You don\u2019t always get to pick your clients, or union member in this case. All that considered, he should be fired.",

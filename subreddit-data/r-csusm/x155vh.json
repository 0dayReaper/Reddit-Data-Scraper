    "postText": "I\u2019m still new to CSUSM and was wondering are there any good quiet places with out a lot of people to be able to take a personal call? Psychiatry appointments are hard to come by these days and I gotta take what I can get. I don\u2019t drive so I don\u2019t have a car to be able to have a private, quiet space. I assume most people don\u2019t care and mind their business but I don\u2019t really know of the best places to take such call since I've only gone to campus once. There's so many people on campus too so I dunno if this kind of place exists either. Any help would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Library study rooms are good but the walls aren\u2019t soundproof and on occasion there might be neighbor study rooms that can be too loud. There are 2 study rooms that are isolated from other study rooms (they host 12 people instead of 6). These 2 study rooms are the only ones that have a window view btw. \n\nAnother quiet area is the garden area which is between the library and USU. It\u2019s very rare to see students use that space.\n\nAlso right outside the library on the 3rd floor, if you walk around the the perimeter of it, there\u2019s a nice shady spot that\u2019s good to to take a break (you can see the garden from this spot) \n\nThe top floor of the art building kinda works but you\u2019ll see occasional students go to their professors office hours there. (Still not a busy area, high traffic area)\n\nAlso maybe the path from behind SBSB to Markestein Hall or even the side staircases of those buildings could work. There just places I remember where I hardly saw anyone and were very quiet",

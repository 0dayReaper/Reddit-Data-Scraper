Also parking on campus fills up pretty quick but majority of people start to leave early afternoon like 3ish. \n\nSource : been doing that drive for 4 years",

            "comment": "Hey!! Welcome to CSUSM! I'm a psych major and transferred here last fall! \n\nSince others have addressed the traffic and stuff, I will ignore that part. \n\nSome things I wish I knew before attending CSUSM (ignore any that you already know!):\n\n\\- Do you have the three lower-division requirements? I'm sure you have PSYC 101, but do you have Stats for the Psych Major and Research/Methods **with lab\\***? If so, you should be able to register for a ton of classes. (Apparently there are CCs that offer this class but do not have the lab portion. CSUSM has a lab-only class which is 1 unit that you can take if you do not have that). Try to get those classes out of the way because they are the pre-reqs to a lot of the upper division stuff.\n\n\\- There is a secondary language requirement at CSUSM for psych majors. That usually means that you have to take 2-3 language classes to fulfill that requirement. You may also be able to test out of it if you are already fluent in another language!\n\n\\- There's also an upper division math/science req, social science req, and humanities req you need to meet before graduating. They're kind of nice because they break up the monotony of our major. \n\n\\- BioPsych is known to be the most challenging class you'll have to take at CSUSM. I think it's because it's the most science-focused class in our major. If you haven't taken a biology class in a while, or you didn't take a lower-div biopsych class in CC, you may benefit from watching some khan academy videos on neuro anatomy, action potential, neurotransmitter stuff, etc. to prepare. It will require a lot of your time and effort so I suggest taking a lighter course load the semester you take it. If you need any tips feel free to reach out and ask! \n\n\\- All of the profs I've taken classes with have been awesome! Highly recommend taking any classes with Gonzalez, McMackin, Kreisler, and/or Hawkins. \n\nIf you have any questions about the psych major or the school, feel free to message me or ask me here! Happy to help in any way I can. :-)",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply! I believe I'll need to take psychological stats because I only took a standard stats course at my CC. I'm currently in a lower div biopsych class and it's easily my favorite, so I'm hoping that I can carry that over to the upper division biopsych! To be honest, I'm a bit intimidated by the language req, I did 2 years of spanish in HS but that was quite some time ago\n\nDo you have any advice on getting into a research lab as an RA? Its something I'm really interested in doing! I'm definitely more into the research side of psychology rather than the clinical/therapeutic route",

                            "comment": "I also took a standard stats course at my CC and my degree planner at CSUSM said I needed to take a psych stats course. So I signed up for one at a local CC in my first semester at CSUSM. I was later told by an advisor that they waved that requirement so I didn't need to take it. Unfortunately, they told me *after* the drop deadline so I ended up finishing it through. I didn't mind since it gave me more experience but I highly, highly recommend speaking to an advisor about that requirement to see if it's absolutely necessary. Feel free to message me for more details on that!\n\nThe language requirement is not bad at all! I hadn't taken a language class in like 15 years (I'm older-ish student) and I felt nervous too! But I took FREN 101 and it was so easy. I was able to skip FREN 102 and go straight to 201 without any issues. I'm sure you'll be fine! \n\nAs for the research labs. [Have you checked out this page?](https://www.csusm.edu/psychology/ra_labs/index.html) It lists all of the profs/labs currently accepting RAs. Some of them are outdated but it's worth it to reach out to the profs and introduce yourself and see if they're taking on any new RAs. It's also never too early to reach out as well so you could start now if you wanted. The masters program at CSUSM is research focused as well in case you are interested in pursuing grad school after this! \n\nAgain, feel free to message me if you have any other questions! Maybe we'll be in the same class in the spring!",

    "postText": "I just accepted my internship at a biotech place in Carlsbad for the summer. I was wondering how I could use my internship as a way to get some credits done for CSUSM? Does making my internship for credit cause any burden on the company? Or is it a completely independent process that the company doesn't need to deal with? \n\nI am a comp sci major if that helps any.",

From what i understand you register for the Biotechnology class that is for an internship (idk the class number but it literally says \"internship in biotechnology\") and during the semester you're \"taking\" those credits you write and submit a report on your time at the company. I say \"taking\" because you will not actually be in any class next semester but you will get the credits for the summer internship over fall semester",

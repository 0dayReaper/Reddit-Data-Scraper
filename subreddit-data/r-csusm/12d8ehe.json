Will there be a lot of people? Do mainly locals go? Do I have to do anything to prepare? I\u2019m probably just overthinking this lol",

I sat in my car, looking around at the totally empty parking lot, confused. I pulled out my confirmation email on my phone and sure enough!! I was a week early. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut I\u2019m honestly insanely happy I went, though. I walked around campus and familiarized myself with the lay of the land. All the food places were closed and the campus was mostly empty. And OMG did I fall in love. It felt like \u201chome\u201d. I went back home, did a bunch of research and decided to submit my intent to enroll the next day. \n\nI\u2019m excited for Blue Cougar Day! I have 2 panels I want to go to (The Psychological Science panel, and the student &amp; alumni panel). And I want to do an official tour too, as well as stop by Kellogg Plaza to talk to the people from DSS (Disability Services). I had emailed them, and even though it\u2019s not on the website, that\u2019s where they\u2019ll be. \ud83d\ude01\n\nHave ALL the fun!!! I plan on bringing by iPad to take any notes (and peoples names or numbers, if I cool meet people). But other than that, yeah! What others have said: look at the site, maybe write down what panel(s) you might be interested in, and where they\u2019ll be held, and anything else you might like to do. It\u2019s a smallish campus, so I\u2019m sure you can wander around and get a good feel for the place. So yeah! Have fun! \ud83d\ude01",

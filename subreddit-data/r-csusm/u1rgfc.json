You could also do a few in front of a building relevant to your major (some look better than others of course).\n\nI\u2019ve also seen a few people take them in Palm Court or over to the right of campus coffee by founder\u2019s circle. The red art statue up on the second level of campus may provide some decent lighting/greenery in the background too.\n\nCongratulations and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll turn out great!",

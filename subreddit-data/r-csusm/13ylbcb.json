In my case the textbooks that I\u2019ve used in my community college were online subscription based, and they expired so I no longer have access to those. I\u2019m just stressing out on how I\u2019ll be able to study because I really want to pass so I can take acct 301",

They can almost certainty tell you more and probably hook you up with the ACCT 201/202 textbooks.\n\nWhen I took them last year they were subscription based too, but I bet someone out there has the physical books.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, so I fucked up and mixed up the date of my orientation, I took time off work, booked flights to come over to CA (I fly back saturday), literally going to be in san diego in 2 hours because of the orientation I thought I had tomorrow. My actual one is next week on the 20th but does anyone know if I'd be able to show up tomorrow and do orientation? \n\nI emailed three times and called twice and they didn't get back to me so I think I'm just gonna try showing up and being like yo im here can I do it?? thoughts?",

It might still be an option because I missed my initially scheduled orientation too, and they let me attend a Zoom meeting that gave a digital tour of the campus and broke us up into rooms by Major. We had crashers, iirc, who weren't scheduled, but I \\*think\\* they got credit for coming as long as they talked to one of the hosts about it at the end.\n\nBut COVID stuff is kind of over at this point. Hopefully you still have similar options. Good luck! Yeah, if you don't attend any orientation, you can't sign up for classes.",

            "comment": "I live in Kensington/Normal Heights area in San Diego and it takes me roughly 45-50 minutes to get to school in the morning. I leave at around 6:15am. The only trafficky part is getting onto the 78 which is the last chunk of the commute. The rest is pretty chill. The drive back to San Diego is also pretty trafficky around 3:45/4pm when you first get onto the 78 and then the last \\~4 miles of my commute is extreme stop/go traffic.\n\nI was concerned about the commute too. I moved here from the Bay Area last July, so when I was thinking of traffic, I was thinking of Bay Area traffic which is *so much worse* than it is here. Drivers in San Diego are actually much nicer about letting you into their lane (for the most part). Coming from a person who doesn't love driving: the commute is doable. Just have podcasts/music ready and you're fine. \n\nI suggest playing around with Google maps.. it is pretty accurate about forecasting traffic. Try to fit all of your classes on campus into 1-2 days to save on time, gas, etc. While the commute sucks, I would not live anywhere else -- I love San Diego! Best of luck to you!",

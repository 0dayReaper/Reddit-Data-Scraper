            "comment": "There's a nice movie theater there. The one in Escondido (the next town over) is closing, though, so it might get a little busier pretty soon.\n\nI haven't seen it myself, but I heard there's a gaming/rec room on campus somewhere.\n\nIf you're willing to go up the freeway and toward the coast a little, there's an indoor skydiving arena and a Boomers! in Vista.\n\nEDIT: Adding more just in case you're from out of the San Diego area.\n\nThe county is brimming with history and culture. Any of the Missions are fun to tour. Old Town is a nice place to get quality Mexican Food. Stuff gets held in the San Diego Convention Center all the time, most famously San Diego Comic Con. Tickets are hard to come by, but you'd be surprised how many venues are outside the Con Center and free to the general public. That one takes place on the third weekend in July.\n\nThere are all kinds of museums in Balboa Park. Natural History, some kind of art, and I think they opened the Comic Museum recently that displays various costumes and props from comic book movies. I still need to go to that. I'd Google \"Balboa Park\" to see what kind of events they're hosting in the future.\n\nThe Angelika theater in Carmel Mountain isn't too much of a drive. It's one of those fancy theaters that serves you dinner and alcohol.\n\nDuring the warmer months (starting in Spring, I believe), downtown Escondido hosts this event every Friday where people drive and park their ancient cars for people to admire. If you like cars and/or history, it can be fun to see working old cars in person.\n\n That's all I got for now.",

This is gonna sound stupid, but as a Mexican myself that has enjoyed Mexican cuisine my entire life, Old Town has Mexican food for tourists. You could find better Mexican food in local joints. In Escondido, I like a place called Lourdes- best caldos you\u2019ll have from a Mexican eatery. You could also make friends with a Mexican and eat at their house; you\u2019ll want to go back!\n\nAnyways, Old Town is fun to visit and stroll around. Excellent recommendations.",

I like Caf\u00e9 Gratitude. Can\u2019t go wrong with tacos anywhere! the Yellow Deli in Vista in an interesting restaurant. Del Mar dog beach, Carlsbad Flower fields, the library in Cardiff by the sea is right on the water.  Bonfires on Oceanside pier! Sometimes I took day trips up to Orange County. Walk around the little shops in La Jolla/Torrey Pines (30 min south)It\u2019s been a while since I was out of school but I can probably think of a ton more!",

If you have a car, you can get to the beach in about 20 mins,, or you can take the train. There's also cool stuff to do if you take the 15 south into the heart of San Diego.",

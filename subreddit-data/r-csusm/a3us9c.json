I live in the UVA, and I feel like I completely screwed things up with my roommates by not hanging out with them more often. Now they do everything without \nme, I feel invisible and it sucks, but I don\u2019t know how to address this without coming across as awkward or annoying, can anyone relate? ",

That said there isn't like an enrollment period for friendships that you missed, find something you want to do and see if they want to too. ",

            "comment": "I had a some what similar situation with my roommates my first year at the UVA. Except the only difference is that, I was the one who always wanted to do things together as a group, while they always wanted to do their own thing. The only way I was really able to overcome this, was to just understand my roommates better and figure out common ground among us. Although, I ended up really only becoming close friends with one of my roommates from the UVA. The only thing i would recommend, would to just first figure out if you and your roommates have any common interests, and if surprisingly you guys don't have any, then you're just gonna need to branch out at school and find some friends that you can chill with. One of my best friends that i met while at csusm, was someone that i met through my time on the lacrosse team for csusm (wasn't my roommate at the time). Now I have been living with that person for the past 2 years and I hope he will be a friend of mine for the rest of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Csusm is not the most social campus to begin with, so don't be discouraged if it seems like everyone on campus just wants to be left alone.",

            "comment": "not sure what your dorm set up is like, but it might help if you go to the \"living room\" part of the dorm while your other roommates are there, instead of just everyone being in their room. Even if you're just eating dinner or something while they're hanging out, it can be a way to show you're available lol. ",

Second thing you have a lot of different options. You could perhaps invite them out to do something, you could also go to one of the RAs  floor programs or potentially join a club on campus. If you live at the UVA you are already a member of the Residence Hall Council and they have meetings biweekly where they talk about doing programs for other students. Would highly encourage you to get involved in something on campus. Lots of different options there. Contact your RA for more info!",

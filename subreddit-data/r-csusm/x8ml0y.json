I now have to send the school a copy of my official transcripts. Should I attach my LOR to my transcripts before I send everything over? Or are letters of recommendation not as big of a deal? Thanks so much!",

I suppose it depends on which type of degree and field you're applying for.  I wouldn't worry too much about it as long as you meet the requirements listed and an overall good egg.",

            "comment": "Psy as in Psychology? Psychology is INCREDIBLY hard to get into at SDSU. I was denied at SDSU and I have a very high GPA, although, even though I\u2019ve lived here for years, I\u2019m not considered \u201clocal\u201d so I didn\u2019t get priority. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to apply, I say apply both places. I could have appealed at SDSU, but decided to go with CSUSM after visiting the campus. I felt like I was home. When I went to SDSU for a tour, I felt like I was going through a meat grinder. There were SO many other people there and it just didn\u2019t feel personal. \n\nAnother thing to consider: SDSU (and especially the psychology classes) are mostly graded on ONLY tests. You read the book, you listen to lectures, and you take quizzes and tests. That\u2019s it. At CSUSM you do more assignments, as there\u2019s a writing requirement. This is WAY better for me because I work better with assignments. It helps me learn the information so that I do well on tests. I\u2019d also fall behind if it was just read test read test. \n\nAt SDSU (and again: esp in Psy) the classes are SO large that you can\u2019t really ask questions and you don\u2019t really get to know your professors. This was a huge one for me too. I want more open communication with professors. Not just because I want letters of recommendation, but also because I genuinely do better by knowing them and feeling at ease to ask questions. \n\nYes, CSUSM is a commuter school, but from what I hear, it\u2019s also hard to make friends at SDSU because the classes are so large and people just rush off to other places after. You can live on-campus on either school though. So if you want to make friends, best case (in either school) is to get into clubs or Greek life. \n\nCrime was also a factor for me. As a woman, I don\u2019t feel safe on the SDSU campus. CSUSM is one of the cleanest and safest colleges I\u2019ve set foot on. \n\nAnyway, I hope this was helpful! \ud83d\udc96",

I am in mission valley and one of the things I\u2019m worried about is the traffic. If I don\u2019t get into sdsu I think I have some good reasons for appeal, but csusm I could start in the spring.

Both schools are very research-heavy. However, you have some options, if you\u2019re looking to do more clinical stuff:\n\nSDSU has a counseling minor. CSUSM does not, HOWEVER!!! I actually switched my major from Psychology to Social Sciences: Psychology at CSUSM. This is a fantastic option for me. This will eliminate the need to take the upper division biopsychology course (that everyone hates and usually has to take more than once to pass), and you won\u2019t have to do as much research stuff. Basically, with SS: Psych, you take most of your classes as Psychology classes. Then you get to choose 2 \u201csecondary fields\u201d where you take at least 12 units in each. I initially chose Communication and Sociology. BUT! There\u2019s another option to work with the Social Sciences department head (Jill Weigt \u2026 pronounced \u201cwait\u201d). You work with her to design a customized secondary field. For it, you can only take one class from either your primary or other secondary field. The rest has to be in other fields. So I am taking an additional Psy class, and a bunch of other classes that will help me more. This includes taking Social Sciences 300. I HIGHLY recommend taking that class as I\u2019ve heard it sets you up for success at the school. It\u2019s \u201ctheories of academic achievement and transfer student success\u201d. And if you decide to go that route, just talk to Jill and she\u2019ll work it into your plan. \n\nAlso: if you\u2019re into meditation, or want to work with clients with mindfulness in general, CSUSM is starting a Mindfulness Major next year. I\u2019m going to be one of their first graduates!!! CSUSM has a budding mindfulness program and you can even do mediations on zoom or in person for free. They also have half day and day retreats etc. It\u2019s pretty amazing. \n\nOh! At CSUSM (for both Psych and SS:Psych) you will have to take a research methods lab class (even if you\u2019ve done reasearch methods at Grossmont already) I hear it\u2019s awful. It\u2019s a 1 unit class and the only instructor they have for it sucks. But I haven\u2019t heard anyone needing to retake it (unlike biopsych). \n\nAnyway!! If you have any questions at all (including what emails to email or who to contact for Social Sciences etc.) you let me know!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m starting this Fall. I just know all this stuff cuz I like to research stuff and talk to a bunch of people.  Haha!",

In my individualized plan, the additional Psych class that I will be taking is the Psychology of Behavior Change. But they also have a class on Clinical Psychology that you could take. And I think having some Sociology classes are helpful as well, as it\u2019ll round out your education. And communication classes are, of course, really helpful (if you decide to take that). Some of the secondary fields are more rigid than others (like the women and gender studies one), but if it\u2019s too rigid, you can ask Professor Weigt if you can customize it! I love both her and prof. Mathew Atherton (social studies professor). I went to Blue Cougar Day and really hit it off with them. Then I went to the Psychology booth and didn\u2019t hit it off with them as much haha! \n\nI\u2019d say look at the roadmap for both Psychology and the SS:Psychology (with the secondary fields).  It should make your mind up for you haha! Looking at all the research classes in Psychology made me sad that I wouldn\u2019t be learning what I wanted to learn. But with ss:Psych actually super jazzed about my classes!!",

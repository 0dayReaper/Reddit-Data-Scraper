Unless you explicitly choose to live alone in a single bedtime studio, most dorms house up to 6 people at a time; some sharing a room others not. Was lucky enough to get a non-shared room and I highly recommend it lol\n\nThere\u2019s a pool and a lounge like most other apartments, but I didn\u2019t really see anyone swimming since it was usually cold outside. It\u2019s literally across the street from campus which was nice and a 10 minute walk/2 minute drive from the campus marketplace. \n\nRoommates are random unless you name specific people you want to stay with and vice versa. Honestly from that point, it\u2019s boils down to how chill your roommates are, just like living anywhere else. Even if they keep to themselves, you can always just make friends with your neighbors and/or invite people over. \n\nOverall, it was alright. Might\u2019ve stayed there again if I didn\u2019t get waitlisted due to a shit ton of people applying lol",

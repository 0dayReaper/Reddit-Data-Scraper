    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nIm a incoming freshman and trying to decide in between majors, either biochemistry or chemistry. Does anyone know which would be easier? I plan on going to PA school and would want a BS major. I had planned to switch into biological science but the major is already impacted. Could I possibly switch later on?\n\nThank you in advance(:",

            "comment": "I have a BS in bio-chem from a different university, so I can share some advice. It depends on your school\u2019s program, but in general I would say that if you enjoy learning about biological systems then bio-chem would be the way to go, but if you enjoy the problem-solving of organic/physical chemistry problems then go with normal chem. Either way, I\u2019d say to look at your school\u2019s credit requirements and curriculum, and see what classes genuinely interest you the most.\n\nAlso, again it depends on your university\u2019s program, but you should be able to switch majors at pretty much any point up until the end of your second year, so you have plenty of time now. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I majored in chemistry my first 2 years of undergrad. I switched to biochemistry because I decided to pursue a career in the medical field and biochem would prepare me better for grad school. I thought chemistry was easier simply because it was and is my true passion. I was able to apply what I learned in chemistry right away in the various chemistry labs. But I didn't feel like I was able to apply what I learned in biochemistry until I started grad school. Ultimately, it's gong to come down to what you're more interested in rather than if the material is \"hard\" or \"easy\". Also, you may want to consider which degree will prepare you best for what industry you want to go in. That may be the best way to choose.",

            "comment": "It depends how each major is organized and on individual preferences. At schools where biochemistry and chemistry are in the Same department there is less difference. Some schools have biochemistry tracks one more chemical one more biological.\n\nA traditional chemistry program has some general science including calculus and physics using calculus. Hen experience in the five main branches of chemistry namely inorganic, organic, biological, physical, and analytical. A biochemistry major in such a program would be very similar but with more biochemistry and possibly a bit less of the other branches.\n\nBiochemistry programs in biology departments tend to require more biology work. Much less and possibly no analytical and inorganic chemistry beyond basics. There may be the option to take either biology major or physical science major versions or some classes like quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics. There may be a bit less lab work.\n\nSummary\nChemistry light biology solid physical sciences\nLight to medium biochemistry but can take a bit more in electives \n\nChemistry with biochemistry emphasis same as above with plenty of biochemistry less inorganic and analytical.\n\nStand alone biochemistry plenty of biochemistry and biology. Some physical science can opt for more. Solid chemistry but less than a chemistry major outside biochemistry.\n\nIn general biochemistry is most relevant to health fields so unless you are unsure of that path, have some particular unusual plan in mind, or are particularly interested in other parts of chemistry it would be safe to study more biochemistry than analytical say.\n\nEdited to add\nI thought I was in r/college when I wrote the above\nI don\u2019t know anything about CSU sm but I just looked at the website \nBiochemistry and chemistry are in the same department and are very similar the differences are interesting though\nCompared to chemistry biochemistry loses one math class and quantum mechanics so take this for giggles \nIt keeps the analytical and inorganic \nIt adds more biochemistry and biology \n\nMost colleges keep the quantum and lose analytical \nIt is a tough choice since both are important \nIt is nice that there is a good amount of biology \n\nDifficulty wise I would guess biochemistry is harder since there are several more biology and biochemistry classes which could be harder than the quantum mechanics the chemistry major has. That extra biochemistry and biology would be good for a health career though.",

            "comment": "Depends on where your interests lie more, as that will tend to be more motivating, as well as whether you feel more confident in more math-based classes or in more conceptual classes. If you find math relatively easy, but struggle more with conceptual stuff and memorization of information, you'll probably find Chemistry, or even Physics, easier than Biology or Biochem. If it's the opposite, then Biology or Biochem would be easier.\n\nIf you find both easy, I'd still say your best bet is probably chem, as it's situated right in the middle of the two ends of that spectrum (on one end physics, on the other Biology), but it's really up to you. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. But also- you can always try starting in one, or both, and switching out if you don't feel it's a good fit!\n\nAs for switching into Biology, since it's impacted, you will have to meet the [minor requirements](https://www.csusm.edu/biology/minorreqs.html) before being able to declare it as your major. [Here](https://www.csusm.edu/biology/bsbiol/index.html) is the page which has more information about changing majors into Biology (about halfway down).",

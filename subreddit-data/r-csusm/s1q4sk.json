    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI received an acceptance letter today for the pre-business program at CSUSM. I was quite surprised to get the letter so early.  I am from California but I live several hours away from CSUSM (Central CA area). So, I'll obviously need to figure out housing and all of that. I'm a little worried, because I have not received any information about grants or scholarships. I filled out the general scholarship application and the FAFSA - but all I was offered was loans. In the past, at the community college I attend (I'm a transfer student), I was given quite a few grants from the FAFSA (enough that all my schooling was pretty much financially covered). Does anyone have any idea if these loan offers are all I'll be getting, or does info on grant and scholarship offers come later? Is the offer I've received conclusive of all I'll be getting?\n\nThanks! Looking forward to hopefully joining everyone at CSUSM!",

Can I ask which business program you applied to? \n\nRegarding financial aid, your grants/loan can vary from each school year.  This is dependent on various factors such as income, parents income, and etc. \n\nIf you filled out your FAFSA and CSUSM has reviewed it, mostly likely you were awarded according to what they think you were eligible for. For instance, I was awarded zero grants/scholarships and 100% loans.  They previous year was different.",

It almost seemed too good to be true, I had to reread the email several times and check My CSUSM - but it is indeed true! I submitted my intent to enroll. \n\nThat's what I was afraid of, haha! It's just such a drastic change from being fully funded through community college and having zero aid other than loans for university. But it is what it is - I appreciate the info, thank you!",

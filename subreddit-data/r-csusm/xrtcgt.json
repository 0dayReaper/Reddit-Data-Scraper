It's required for me to pass it for my major but there's nothing depending on that class afterwards. So if I unfortunately get a D, will it count as passed for my graduation requirements?",

The bullshit classes don\u2019t matter, your major classes do.\n\nFor a Software Engineer, linear algebra is a useful math to know. Especially when you\u2019re solving algorithms that have to do with matrices. And you will be solving those for interviews. \n\nBottom line? Get your shit together, OP.",

I already work in the field, so I kind of understand that already. \nLiterally studied my ass off for an exam and still didn't do well. The professor said he purposely makes the exams incredibly hard. And i still studied way more than norma and got stumped by his questions. I know I have to step it up. I'm literally trying to understand if the worst case scenario is viable out of curiosity, not to depend on. So bottom line? My shit is together, I'm just trying to understand.",

I wanted to be blunt because, as you know, several people in our major don't take core classes seriously until it feels like it is too late. By this time, fundamentals are weak and to come back from that takes a lot of effort. It does sound like you understand the importance and I feel for you in regards to exams being designed for failure.\n\nI guess the next question to ask is if this particular professor curves? If he does not, what is the passing rate? Are there any extra credit you can ask him to do during office hours to push the D up to a C?\n\nCheers.",

Haha\nI love CS, in fact my GPA is only a Bish average because back when I first tried out college and didnt know what i wanted to doI ended with a 1.7ish. I've been able to drag it back up to a 3.1. ( and my csusm CS GPA is 3.8, I promise I work really hard lol)\n\nAnyways, he does curve the class down a full letter grade which is fantastic, so I only need a 70% for a B. But like when I say I did bad. I did reallllly bad. No extra credit, and I spent a large chunk of time studying a portion that wasn't even on the test, and the other majority of the exam, I mixed up two formulas which were 40% of the grade. \n\nI'm still incredibly confident I can manage a B. And if he doesn't grade too harshly, (or if I'm lucky and he decides he'll replace the lowest test score with the final like most of my math professors have done) then I'm still confident I can push for an A. I just want to understand my options since I'm not used to D's.",

I left Cal State San Bernardino with a 1.7 GPA and a crap ton of dead weight classes (as I switched majors to CIS at CSUSM). After 3 years of almost all straight A's/Dean's List...I brought the overall GPA up to 3.0 (and CSUSM was 3.8).\n\nAlso, oof...that sounds like a mistake I have done before on discrete math. In the event you do not pass, there is always CIS. If you do not feel like making up the class, you can always study matrices on your own time and switch to CIS. Interestingly enough, CSUSM still puts Computer Science on your degree even though you did CIS. It does not differentiate them!\n\nThat being said, rooting for you. If you pass the final, most professors normally pass you with a B because you've demonstrated proficiency. I would make sure the professor knows who you are and can see you are putting effort into passing the class. This can make all the difference sometimes.",

I'm going to keep pushing, if I manage an A or even a B on the final there's no way I don't pass the class, and I know from here were essentially going to be using Matlab and honing in on specific subjects, I always struggle the first quarter of every semester because it's A LOT of foundational concepts for every class. But after that I usually do really well. And the next exam is specifically going to be focused on Matrices, so i think I'll be able to turn it around",

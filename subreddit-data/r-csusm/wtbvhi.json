    "postText": "I've lived in North County my entire life. I am transferring from a local community college. I got into some top UCs this past year but chose CSUSM because it was the only college I could afford (my family makes a little over to qualify for Cal grants and other need based aid). Right now, I'm feeling some remorse based on the prestige (although I like my department) and because life at home is rough. I ultimately want to be a professor and that track is also rough because of the scarcity of tenure in the social science major I am in so I thought hold off on getting into debt for grad school if needed. \n\nOverall, why did you guys choose CSUSM? Has anyone else felt this?\n\nSorry and thanks for the vent session.",

I was a little worried that it would make finding work more difficult since the university has less name recognition.\n\nI graduated in 2020 and have zero regrets. I\u2019m in software and it appears nobody cares where my degree is from. Employers just like that I have it and that I have a resume that shows a clear pattern of interest and excellence in software.\n\nI suspect it\u2019s similar if you want to be a professor in that it\u2019s less about the prestige of your degree and more about the quality of your research.",

            "comment": "Last year, my husband and I were moving to San Diego so it was between SDSU and CSUSM. I had my heart set on SDSU because of the \"prestige\". Despite having a 4.0 gpa and all of the core courses completed, I didn't get in because I wasn't local at the time. I was really devastated and kind of felt the same way as you. BUT, hear me out. \n\nCSUSM is awesome, truly. I actually think CSUSM is underrated. The classes are smaller and it's *much* easier to register for the classes you want (the first semester can be the hardest since you have a later registration date). It's much easier to stand out in class and profs are so much more accessible which allows you to form strong connections with them. That, and it's one of the most affordable public colleges in California which is what I was looking for. The only downside to CSUSM (which is more so unique to my life) is that the commute sucks. I live in San Diego so it takes me 30-50 minutes to get to campus. I can handle that! As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, CSUSM is what you make of it. \n\nThe truth of the matter is this: nobody cares about what school you go/went to. Those who do judge have their own issues and it's not on you. I think you should feel extremely proud of the schools you got into (seriously -- congrats!), but remember that you are already halfway done your undergrad. Two years will fly by for you. My advice is to reach out to the profs who you are inspired by and tell them about your interest in becoming a prof. It's likely that one of them would be happy to mentor you!! :-) \n\nWelcome to CSUSM!",

If you *are* safe for the time being, I hope you can get through the next few years of school and be able to move out when you get the chance. CSUSM has excellent counselors who are there to help you if you need to talk it through with them.",

            "comment": "I chose CSUSM for business instead of going out of state to study nuclear engineering. I know big leap. But prestige is something you don\u2019t think about unless you\u2019re in high school or first year or 2 of college. Cause college is just hard the way it is.\n\nThanks to going to CSUSM I\u2019m gonna have no college debt going into my life. I mean it\u2019s only $3860 a semester. I made more than that working a fast food job this summer! This place still offers the American dream ya know.\n\nAs for home life, I know what you mean. I have an EXTREMELY bad home life. Lots of bad stuff with my parents. But focus on yourself! \n\nPersonally, I took the winter rome study abroad and wow my whole outlook on life changed. I think you should save up and study abroad. Even doing a semester long thing is affordable. Because they match tuitions for whatever university you\u2019re going to abroad. Just research!\n\nYou remember what people told us when we were younger? \u201cCollege is what you MAKE of it\u201d. Well it\u2019s YOUR job to make it awesome\n\nAlso to finish about prestige, I interned at a really nice company this summer and lots of EMPLOYEES were from CSUSM. And it\u2019s because, who would have guessed, they\u2019re a local university. Most jobs need to train you, so be someone worth training. Be someone worth taking a chance on for your field!",

            "comment": "To be honest CSUSM was not my first choice, I was rejected by UCSD and this was my only other option. After I got over the disappointment I realized how relieved I was. As others have said it\u2019s so much cheaper and even though I don\u2019t get as much aid I\u2019m able to pay tuition easily with my Summer job. I haven\u2019t started my first semester yet (I\u2019m an incoming transfer for Fall) but I got an on camps job and have been meeting so many amazing people who have gotten me so excited to start my classes. Like many others have said, it\u2019s going to be what you make of it, the advice I\u2019ve received from other students and faculty members: network, go to office hours, get a mentor, join a club, and take advantage of all the free services and support groups.",

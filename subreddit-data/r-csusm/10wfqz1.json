A couple of classmates got jobs at Toyota, SAP, and Salesforces with offers from FAANG.  Personally I believe the program is better compared to SDSU but that\u2019s from word of mouth and friends that attend SDSU.",

If you learn everything the degree has to offer, learn a side language or two, and have a few personal projects then you\u2019re fine. \n\nCompanies literally do not care where you graduated from for a CS degree. They care if you can pass the technical interview.",

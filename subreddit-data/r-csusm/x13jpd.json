    "postText": "Hi everyone! I only have class 2 days a week, and I was wondering if you can buy a visitors pass each day to use in PS2? I don\u2019t think a semester pass will be worth it for me and I\u2019m a little confused about the system. All of my classes are in the extended learning building and I\u2019d like to park around that area if possible. Thank you for your help!! :)",

I'm doing the same this semester but twice a week. I agree that it isn't worth it to pay for the semester pass. As long as you are paying for parking, you should be okay. Hope that helps! \n\nIn case you have any concerns, [here is the link](https://www.csusm.edu/parking/students.html) to the parking info.",

The all day pass works for my schedule as I'm there from like 7am-8:30pm, but if you're only there for one or two classes then the 30 min interval may work better for you. OP, download the app. I don't think there's a way to pay for it in advance if you're paying daily.",

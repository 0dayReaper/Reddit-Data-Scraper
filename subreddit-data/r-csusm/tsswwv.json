My biggest values are a college where people are nice, there's good student life, a lot of people living in the dorms, good classes, and a good study abroad program!",

Over half of freshmen live at home with their family.\n\nCSUSM is very much a school for people who just want to get a degree. It is not a school to go to for the whole \"college experience\" thing.",

Which if that\u2019s the case you\u2019re better off saving the cash, going to a JC for 2 years and then transferring over. To get a good ROI on college, you need to go to a better school with better networking opportunities. Networking is going to be your number one tool to accelerate your career. The second piece of advice, you didn\u2019t ask for but I wish someone told me, major in something that will provide you with a solid income and a high salary ceiling (usually STEM). Minor in whatever it is that enjoy learning about. Do the internships, the mixers, meet as many people as you can. Don\u2019t put yourself in crazy debt unless you know the ROI exist within your career path.",

The dorms are very crowded, my daughter's dorm has like 8 girls in it. The quad appears more happening than UVA, where she is. Classes are fine. They drive down to the SDSU area on the weekends to hang out. Not much goes down in San Marcos.",

            "comment": "CSUSM was by FAR my absolute last choice, but I am glad I ended up here.\n\nHonestly, your college experience is what you make of it. The QUAD is definitely nicer than the UVA. I currently live in a QUAD single and the price is honestly worth it. The university is also currently building more \u201ctraditional\u201d style dormitories adjacent to the QUAD that should be done being built by the fall (if you\u2019re looking for a more affordable option). From what I\u2019ve seen and experienced, the QUAD definitely has the more active social scene if that is something you value.\n\nThe social life here is honestly what you make of it. There are so many orgs on campus, and student centers, to become involved with. I am currently in Greek life and it is loads of fun. I made all of my friends the first couple weeks here just by knocking on peoples doors and asking them if they want to hangout or if they want to grab a bite to eat. My roommates have also become some of my best friends! I know this is not the case for everyone, but be honest with yourself and others when you\u2019re looking for roommates for the best possible outcome :) The school also hosts a ton of on campus events with free food and swag, you just have to be on the lookout. (Tbh some of them are lame but you should go just for the free t-shirts).\n\nBeing a state school, and a lesser known one at that, the university isn\u2019t competitive by any means in my honest opinion. I think difficulty in classes is going to be based off your major and the type of student you are. Some classes are reserved for certain majors up until a cap, so it\u2019s hard registering in that case. Classes are usually on the smaller side, so it\u2019s easier to get one on one time in class with your professors and to build a relationship with them if you choose to do so. CSUSM is a tier 2 research institution, so the facilities for labs aren\u2019t bad, but they aren\u2019t the best in my opinion. But there are still opportunities for research on campus if you are interested. \n\nThe location is great too. We are only 20 minutes from the beach and 45 from San Diego. San Marcos is a very lowkey and quiet town, which I enjoy, so I love taking day trips with my friends to surrounding areas :) \n\nIf you have any questions don\u2019t hesitate to DM me!",

How do you feel being a \"commuter school\" affects student life? Are people easy to befriend, or do they come by for class and then leave?",

A lot of people in classes leave ASAP, but I\u2019ve made friends in mine through forming study groups :)) For the most part, I\u2019d say people are easy to befriend here (especially if you are an incoming student, DEF go to the events campus puts on for new students and join orgs that interest you)!!!",

I know that Fall 2022 is going to be mostly in person, so that\u2019s good for more interactions.\n\nOverall, with my limited experience, everyone has been nice. There are opportunities to be more involved with student life once more people are on campus, so I imagine that will improve. Don\u2019t know about dorms tho. \n\nDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re studying, but most professors are cool. Generally, always check rate my professor to see what you\u2019re getting into before you register for that class. \n\nHad a friend that did the Rome study abroad program, and they absolutely loved it. It was 3 weeks during Winter. Dec-Jan. I know the last few years the program was cancelled for Covid but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s coming back. I think they also do summer in Spain, and I saw another one where they go to Paris/Netherlands (but it\u2019s been cancelled for the time being). For sure, Spain and Rome will continue being there.",

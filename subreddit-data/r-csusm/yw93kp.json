Every single one of the currently employed accounting professors have abysmal ratings on ratemyprofessor.com. \n\nHas anyone taken any accounting courses and if so, how was your experience with the professors?\n\nThanks",

It's a lot of theory, various types of calculations, and LOTS of content. Styles is easily understandable while lecturing and provides clear workings. He does ramble a bit here and there, but overall he definitely cares about his students.\n\nTook Zhou last fall and had to drop halfwat through. Wasnt so much her as it was the Covid conditions that still existed and intermittent zoom sessions. She goes fast and has a bit of an accent, but if you attend class and study, I'm sure you'll do well. (This goes for all COBA faculty)\n\nCSUSM has a great reputation for their accounting program; many of my peers have standing job offers with a year of education left. Work hard and it will be worth it!",

There\u2019s only 5 accounting professors according to the accounting faculty directory. They are: Richard Hwang, Aner Zhou, Jolynn Zhou, Yushi Tian, and Alan styles. I assume that most of the teachers you took back than have retired.",

Both of them are great, but accounting can be HARD, especially 201 and 202 if this is your first introduction to the concepts.\n\nI know for a fact that those low ratings are the result of students who struggled with the material but did not attend office hours or the COBA sponsored tutoring (I didn\u2019t see any of the complainers there but I did see the A students).\n\nAlso, after hearing some of the low performers talk, I can tell you that there was a lot of blatant racism because of their accents which I know led to some low ratings",

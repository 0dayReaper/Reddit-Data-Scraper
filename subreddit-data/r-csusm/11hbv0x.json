I\u2019m having a hard time choosing a school.\n\n The CSUSM undergraduate program is 75 units over 5 semesters about 24 classes total. SDSU undergraduate program is 32 units (11clases) over 4 semesters. \n\nI would commute to either college csusm is about a 30 min drive and SDSU is about a one hour drive. \n\nI also got admission to Cal state Chico, long beach, and sac state. But CSUSM and SDSU are my two top choices. \n\nWhat factors did you use when choosing the best school for your undergraduate program?",

I would double check with the contacts on the csusm undergrad slp Website. I think they also have free zoom sessions talking about the program which can also be found in the csusm slp Website.",

I know that if you go to SDSU you raise eyebrows because their program is competitive :D\n\nFYI, I am in SDSU and in the SLP undergrad if you want feedback on that program DM me :)",

The first two semesters weren\u2019t too bad but eventually working full-time and school in the evening wears you down by the summer semester. As for staff, you have a mixed bag with the faculty because some will give you their absolute best effort, while some will pass you if you even just breathe on an assignment.\n\nFor the SIR project (The project that is required to complete the program) my cohort either partnered with their company or found a research lab on campus. Overall that\u2019s just the direct answers to your questions, but feel free to DM if anything else.",

Each Class is once a week (with 1-4 classes depending on the semester) and will go from 5:30-8:30 in the evening.\n\nAlso feel free to DM me if you have any other questions.",

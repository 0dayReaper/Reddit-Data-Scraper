They drive a prius around that scans plates and checks the system to see if you have a pass so if it cant read a plate you get ignored. Worked for me the semester before COVID started.",

You can park at Ralph\u2019s the problem is it\u2019s about a 30-40 min up hill hike to your classes. Potentially even more if you have classes in further parts of the campus\u2026 needless to say\u2026 I bought the 400$ parking pass.",

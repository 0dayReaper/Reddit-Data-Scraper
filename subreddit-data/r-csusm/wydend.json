I get the waste of money, but I just applied for everything that I could and luckily some of my schools accepted me for Spring. A coping method to me was the money was worth spending knowing that I did all I could to get in either semester.\n\nGood luck this application period :) I hope you get into the schools you apply for! That and CSUSM :3",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm excited to start my time at CSUSM and wanted to see if anyone could let me know what orientation for transfer students is like? Tbh I'm a bit nervous to start university after being at a community college for a few years, so I was hoping to ease my anxiety by figuring out what I can expect at orientation",

            "comment": "There's no reason to be anxious, it's the same orientation as any other event. You get your badge/school ID. Staff comes in and tells you what an amazing person you are making amazing choices such as choosing this specific university. Then they have a current student from your specific college guide you around and answer basic questions. \n\nI came in as a transfer student and finished my bachelors in two years. From my experience csusm was essentially the same grind as my community college experience at palomar. I think a lot of it has to do with csusm being a commuter school where most student get in and and get out. There are clubs and stuff but a lot of them were barely functioning pre covid and most are struggling to just exist currently.\n\nMy advice is to make nice if any professors from your department shows up to visit your group. Being noticed is important when you're looking for recommendations for jobs or grad studies after finishing up your bachelors.",

            "comment": "I transferred last semester. Orientation is pretty long so be prepared for 4-5 hours. The freshman one is longer. \n\nIt is pretty simple, just like going over a syllabus but instead it\u2019s all information about the university. There are club tables and resources so there is a lot to learn! The tables also have little freebies so I suggest bringing a bag or backpack. \n\nFor food all they had were cookies, chips and water so I would eat before or bring something to eat. \n\nThere is a part where you sit in a lecture hall and they go over a lot of rules and regulations, it can be a little tedious but it\u2019s all important info. \n\nFor me the best part was all the information/club tables. You get to meet people, chat and learn a lot about the different things happening on campus.\n\nThey also didn\u2019t do a tour so you may want to go early or stay later to explore the campus on your own (or with some students you meet!)",

In the afternoon,  you can get help enrolling in classes if you haven't already. It's kind of just another way the school makes money... but hey! You get a sandwich and a t-shirt!",

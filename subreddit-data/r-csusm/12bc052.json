            "comment": "Hey! Congrats and welcome to CSUSM! I'm a fellow psych student graduating this spring, and I had the same kind of questions as you two years ago. :-) I'll do my best to answer your questions. I apologize for the lengthy responses, but I know I needed this when I started!\n\n\\- Do you have access to [MyCSUSM](https://my.csusm.edu) yet? It won't work at the moment since they're still working on transferring your credits to their system which takes some time. However, you will use the Degree Planner to help you figure out how many/what courses you need each semester to graduate on time. It's very helpful! I used that, but I also created my own personal spreadsheet that I'd be happy to send you if you want it.\n\n\\- The classes you don't have to take at CSUSM related to our major are all of the lower-division classes\\*\\* since you fulfilled that at Cuyamaca/Grossmont. So, you'll only be taking classes that are in the 300-400 level. With that said, there are *some* upper-division classes you'll be required to take such as social psychology that you may have taken at community college. In my experience, both classes were almost identical but we have a writing requirement at CSUSM so there was more writing required for that course. You cannot use any of your lower-division courses you took at CC to fulfill *any* of the upper-division classes at CSUSM.\n\n\\- \\*\\*I do want to note that for some reason, I was told I needed to take another stats course in my first semester here even though I took one at my CC. That turned out to be a mistake on their end, and by the time I found out it was too late to drop! I think it's because my stats course at CC did not explicitly state in the title that it was for social science majors or something. Anyway, I'm mentioning it in case this happens to you. If it does, be sure to send them your syllabus for that class or something so they can make an exception or fix it before you have to take it for no reason.\n\n\\- The only reason why your Research Methods class would not fully transfer to CSUSM is if it didn't have a lab component. You can find that out if you look at the syllabus of the research methods class you took at your community college. If it says anything about a lab, you'll be able to transfer it no problem. If it didn't have a lab, you'll need to take a 1-unit lab course in your first semester at CSUSM. I didn't have that problem, so I can't speak about the experience of that 1-unit course.\n\n\\- Yes, there is a 3-semester language requirement to graduate. I took French and I did so well in the first class that I was able to skip the second class and move to the third one no problem. If you have any prior experience with another language, you can test out of that requirement I believe, or you can do what I did.\n\n\\- I took a look at my course sequence in the last two years, and this is what my course load looked like each semester:\n\nFall 2021: 5 courses (includes that stats course I **didn't** have to take) = 16 units\n\nWinter 2022: 1 course = 3 units\n\nSpring 2022: 4 course = 12 units\n\nSummer 2022: 1 course = 3 units\n\nFall 2022: 5 courses = 15 units\n\nSpring 2023: 4 courses = 13 units",

I\u2019ll DM you \ud83d\udc96 this eases my mind a bit to see that I wouldn\u2019t have to take 18 units per semester, especially if I take winter and summer classes. I know SOME Spanish. Just from doing over a year of Duolingo though. I guess there\u2019s no harm in TRYING to test past the 1st semester\u2026 although no telling if there is a difference vocab words between what duo is teaching me, vs the class\u2026 I also took a semester of German, but that was many moons ago (like 20 years) as I\u2019m a returning student. \n\nI also like the writing requirement at CSUSM! I was looking at appealing to SDSU (I have a very strong case), but I hear they ONLY go off it tests and I\u2019m more of a conceptual learner who likes assignments and discussions to solidify information.\n\nI\u2019ll be commuting from El Cajon as I can\u2019t move closer (kinda \u201cstuck\u201d in a good situation at my current place, living in a house on my mother in law\u2019s property). So hopefully I\u2019ll be able to take some classes online, and for the rest, take them only on select days so I only have to go 2x a week. We\u2019ll see. But with 80min of my day going to driving (and that\u2019s if there\u2019s no traffic), I\u2019m afraid of a heavy course load. \n\nThanks again! I\u2019ll DM you right now. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\n\nEDIT: sent you chat just now, not a DM. Thanks! \ud83d\ude4f",

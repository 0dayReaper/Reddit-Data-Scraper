There\u2019s some hiking trails if you\u2019re into that. There\u2019s an axe throwing spot, bowling, movie theater, trampoline park, rock climbing, and other places like that. There\u2019s events at the USU on campus and stuff that campus recreation put together. If you go farther away you can go to many different beaches, down south to San Diego, or up north to LA.",

But closer by, vista, calabash, Oceanside and Escondido all have some spots you can explore.\n\nOther than bar hopping, drinking, and food, ppl really like to take advantage of the beach to surf or have fun. Again, we are really close to SD And a bunch of scenes are really close to San Marcos. Up to you whether or not u make the most of it. \n\nBowling at bowlero in San Marcos is also fun.",

I live in Rancho Bernardo, which is around a 20-minute drive from CSUSM, and Del Mar beach is about a 20-30 minute drive south from where I live. There are also beaches around the Oceanside/Carlsbad area, which are also about the same distance away from CSUSM.",

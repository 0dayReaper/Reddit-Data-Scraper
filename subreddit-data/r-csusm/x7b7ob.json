    "postText": "Hi there! I (27M from Amsterdam) will be studying at CSUSM for the spring semester next january and I am looking for housing tips in the neighbourhood. San Marcos seems like a pretty calm or maybe boring place to live so I am wondering what other options there are, I was thinking maybe Oceanside or San Diego?? Let me know!",

            "comment": "Strongly consider the commute. In the evening, the drive back home from class could take you upwards of an hour depending on traffic. Sure, metropolitan San Diego is cool and fun, but traffic SUCKS! Maybe just visit Oceanside or San Diego on the weekends. CSUSM has a train that will take you directly to the coast, and a cheap car rental program too.",

Submitting an application through an apartment complex website instead of some third party apartment finder website could help you not get scammed.",

    "postText": "hey yall, incoming freshman here. i cant decide if i should take math 105 or 115. math hasnt always been the easiest subject for me. i feel if I take 105 ill be better supported, but with seeing how many meeting times there are a week I'm a little discouraged. i feel like I could handle 115, if I found tutoring separately and went whenever I would need it. if anybody has taken the class and knows why there's so many blocks a week, pls lmk. i cant tell what each block is on the scheduling assistant and I'm a little confused. thanks :)",

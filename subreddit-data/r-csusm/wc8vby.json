            "comment": "Yes there are!!! Though any research opportunities or internships are based on whether you seek them out or not. There are plenty of undergrads doing research and there are great programs like URISE, McNair, and OTRES that focus on getting students research experience here on campus and even summer research experiences elsewhere. The goal of these programs is to help you get in to grad school or whatever careeer you want to go into. \n\nThe bio program is relatively small but it\u2019s a very tight nit and supportive community. If you enter that community by speaking to professors, joining a lab, and/or some sort of program, the profs will only work to help you succeed. Though I didn\u2019t come here as an undergrad, I have had a very gratifying experience here as a Masters student and Ik a lot of students who seek these opportunities out are very successful.\n\nIn my case, I never joined any of these programs but through just talking and working with professors they gave me a lot of guidance and support. I am now on my way to Stanford to pursue my PhD studies and wouldn\u2019t have achieved this without support and opportunities that faculty have provided. I can only speak very highly of CSUSM and it\u2019s bio faculty. \n\nTo brag for the department, my Masters cohort has others joining PhD programs at John Hopkins, Princeton, UC Davis, UC Riverside, and some undergrads are going to UC Berkeley, CU Denver, and other highly regarded programs for their PhDs. \n\nAs for honors, I believe there is but I am not too sure.\n\nOverall, there are opportunities at both places. Whether or not you take those opportunities is up to you. I can only speak for CSUSM and only as a grad student, but the profs here are so dedicated to their students and the success of their students that if you take the opportunities provided here you are pretty much close to guaranteed to be successful in your endeavors.\n\nEdit: Grammar; and also, honors imo isn\u2019t going to really propel you forward too much. It might look good or it might prepare you a little bit more for endeavors like grad school but I have not seen anyone be highly regarded or significantly propelled for doing honors work. As long as you maintain good grades, get involved, you\u2019ll be golden. It\u2019s not like high school where honors really really helps. Tbh. Talking to people and professors helps wayyyy more.",

We toured last week (my 2023 is looking at it and will also be a Biology major)\n\nShe was disappointed about the lack of honors college but overall liked the campus a lot.  I\u2019ve heard good things about their biology program.",

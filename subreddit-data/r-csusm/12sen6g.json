            "comment": "So far from experience......  \n\n\n1.higher level 300 and 400 level courses are hard to come by, especially for your major\n\n2. enerally speaking, GENERALLY......your 302 and possibly 304 classes have a high chance of being offered. \n\n3. Of course, all these are  dependent on the willingness and/or schedule of the professor.\n\n4. If I am not mistaken, I believe they offered FIN 304 and MKTG 302 in the summer, ***but        remember each summer or ANY semester, what is offered is not always the same as the preceding semester.***  \n\n\n[Summer 2023 schedule](https://www.csusm.edu/el/courses/summer/schedule.html) &lt;--- this link takes you to the CSUSM course schedule for 2023 \n\nBTW. I also noticed that alot of GE's and also the \"diversity\" requirenments being offered during the summer and winter sessions.\n\nPlanning my course schedule for 2 years came with its challenges. The classes that you want to take and especially when you want to take them dont always align with what will be offered. I know that because of this some students had to take an extra semester.\n\nGood luck",

Got it I won't count on that use this summer as next summer's precedent; thanks for linking that summer catalog. That's the exact thing I was kind of irk'ed about-- the fact that summer/winder sessions are not recorded on pdf or saved on-site archives, but are only updated continuously. \n5. Ive used Coursicle to predict/assure myself of class availability, but even that doesn't have summer info:\n   1. [https://www.coursicle.com/csusm/courses/](https://www.coursicle.com/csusm/courses/)\n   2. Not even the Scheduling Assistant has a summer term recorded in their system.\n\nCSUSM is gatekeeping fr",

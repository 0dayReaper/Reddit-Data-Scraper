    "postText": "I have a professor right now who is insufferably difficult, refuses to answer questions for clarification, and grades incredibly hard. Several other students of this professor that I\u2019ve talked to are complaining of the same thing and are panicking over their grades and the unclear expectations of the instructor. I have never had to go as far as filing a complaint, but I feel like I have no other options at this point. \n\nShe gave me a zero on a pop quiz that I was absent for when she had a doctor\u2019s note from me and accepted that as an excusable absence (I have email proof of this). I had reached out to her for an opportunity to make up the pop quiz or turn in an alternative assignment, but she told me she doesn\u2019t allow that. I can only take that as her encouraging students to come into class when they are ill, which poses a health risk to others.\n\nThere are so many problems with this professor that I couldn\u2019t possibly list them all. I refuse to take this course again. I just need some info on how I go about filing a complaint or if any of you have seen a positive outcome out of this.",

Sooner the better since we\u2019re already on week 10. From my experience the campus staff is very friendly and always willing to help out! I hope it gets figured out! :)",

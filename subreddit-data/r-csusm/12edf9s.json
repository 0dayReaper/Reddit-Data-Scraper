    "postText": "Hello! I am an incoming freshman at csusm and wondered if the school cares a lot about living off campus during your first year. Im not a local and live up In the Sacramento area. But my parents want to rent an apartment for me in San Marcos. I would be living with myself or maybe a roommate but I saw that the campus requires on-campus living. If I turn in that form saying I live with my parents at that address will they have someone check? or for the independent status, what does the verification mean.?",

    "postText": "Hey! I was wondering if I would still receive my financial aid refund while taking a gap semester. I read somewhere that it would adjust accordingly to the amount of credits you're taking but I am still unsure. On my student portal it says I'll receive an anticipated refund of the same amount I would get if I was a full-time student. \n\nThank you in advance! \n\nTLDR: Would I still receive financial aid while taking a gap semester?",

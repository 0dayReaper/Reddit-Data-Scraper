My goal with this project (if approved by you, already got the OK-go from approaching236) is to make this subreddit feel more like a CSUSM subreddit.\n\nMy qualifications are basic HTML and CSS web design, I made my own website from scratch which can be viewed here http://www.rebelgrade.com/. Definitely not a professional by any means but I'm fairly experienced and have an eye for design.\n\nAs long as this post gets more upvotes than downvotes, I think we have a go. \n\nSuggestions and constructive criticism is/are highly welcome. \n\nI would recommend replying to this post (rather than PMing me) so that the best suggestions are voted upon and implemented (i.e. suggestions with the most upvotes will be given priority, suggestions with more downvotes won't be implemented)",

They are about as inspiring and interesting as our campus architecture that only prisions would be jealous of. Don't get me wrong, I love CSUSM and I've loved my past 5 years (yay super senior!) here, but I feel the school is sorely lacking in aesthetic appeal. I would definitely encourage using the school colors, but maybe some other ones as well. Or really, do whatever you want. Trust your instincts as a designer. ",

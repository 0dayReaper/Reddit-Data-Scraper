I am transferring to CSUSM in a year or so and im going into accounting.\n\nI wanted to know if CSUSM has a good accounting department or if I should look for another school. \n\nI\u2019d also just like to ask questions about the courses, programs, internships, and more.",

But i felt they had an overall good program there aside from a few bad courses with professors that are no longer there. Ymmv though. Feel free to DM me. I went directly into industry but still went for the CPA license.",

            "comment": "The accounting program here is pretty solid. The classes are difficult, but it will \"toughen\" you up for when you do accounting in the real world. Some people will complain about the professors, and there are actually some pretty bad ones, but at the end of the day, if you know your stuff, you will be fine in your classes.   \n\n\nWe have about the same opportunities as pretty much any other school when it comes to accounting in SD. I recommend, study hard in your accounting courses, meet and connect with a lot of accounting students in the program, and be proactive in applying to internships.   \n\n\nThere are a handful of firms who do not recruit from our school. While it makes it a little more difficult to connect with recruiters and professionals from those firms, there job applications are still up on our schools career website, and you can easily connect with them on linkedin and ask them for a coffee chat. Just because you go to CSUSM doesn't mean you will be robbed of the opportunities that other schools may have. If you play your cards right and work hard and smart, you will do well at whatever it is you want to do.   \n\n\nGood luck! And feel free to dm me if you have any questions as I am currently an accounting student at CSUSM. I also recommend joining the Accounting Society. They will help you a lot and expose you to a lot of opportunities the accounting program has at CSUSM.",

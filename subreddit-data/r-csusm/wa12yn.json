For those who have taken them,  are they slightly less workload or feel like it\u2019s the same as a 3 unit class? And any professor recommendations or tips for the classes would be helpful!",

Graduated 2020 BSBA, focusing on supply chain management \ud83d\ude42  I wish I could help you out more, but a lot of the professors that I had when I went aren\u2019t there, or I was required to take the 304 class, which was taught by a different set of professors.\n\nFor BUS 302, chances are that you\u2019ll end up with Antoniou. He comes off as a dick, but as long as you go to office hours (I can\u2019t stress this enough) and ask genuine questions, you\u2019ll be fine. You gotta remember, his class size is about 3-4 times larger than any other upper division course you\u2019ll take. He doesn\u2019t fuck around with bullshit. \nAlso, make sure you do the assignment on the first day of class. Yes, you\u2019ll have homework due the very first day. PM me if you have questions. \n\nFor OM 302, Tasooji is pretty easy, but he can be pretty\u2026 eccentric sometimes. He goes on a LOT of tangents, talking a lot about his days at Nokia and Sony Ericsson. I didn\u2019t have him for OM 302 (had to take 305), but I did have him for project management. \n\nFIN 302 - I had Rauterkus. He was just an average professor, nothing stellar but nothing bad by any means. Solid B, if I were to give him a grade lol. I heard that Kang is pretty passionate about finance (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on the situation). For an easier pass, I think Rauterkus is your best bet. A few assignments and multiple choice exams. Idk if they still have it, but they had dedicated finance students who would help tutor students (especially on the homework). The tutors also have the answer key, so you can always end up with a good grade. \n\nAgain, just PM me if you have any more questions!\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, depending on the class and the professor, the workload can be negligible. I think the biggest difference between a 302/304 class is just having a larger project to work on, or having multiple projects.",

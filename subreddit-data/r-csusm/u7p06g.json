Still quiet compared to most schools, but if you join a student organization or club you\u2019ll find the more social side of things. Keep an eye out for small events, they pop up pretty regularly. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for super social and content bustling student life and activities though, this isn\u2019t really the place, unfortunately.",

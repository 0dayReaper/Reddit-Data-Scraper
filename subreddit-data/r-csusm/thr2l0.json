I'm already in contact with an advisor about some messed up stuff that is currently happening with my acquired units (I can add the detail if you guys want it later). I just want to get some advice on some easy 3 unit courses for the summer just in case the school forces me to attend and pay $1200 for 3 random units.",

Save the headache and find something that looks easy based on ratemyprof or is mildly interesting.\n\nI got screwed on getting into one class (tried 6 other options) during a semester and it was a fight that I lost. Use that money for something better and get the credits elsewhere!",

I needed 18 more units to graduate at the end of fall 21, I decided I would take 3 during winter at Palomar and 15 for Spring. The thing is there was a \"not so obvious\" requirement for those last 3 units, they needed to be taken at CSUSM. For whatever reason the last three units I needed had to be taken at CSUSM, there were no cultural requirements, major requirements, or GE requirements, just purely units. When I transferred those units they counted towards my GPA but the units didn't because there was also a limit on the amount of units you can transfer, which is apparently 70. But it says this limit nowhere but on a single page on the entirety of the CSUSM website",

It\u2019s going to be difficult to find someone to cover my shift because we are short staffed.",

Can you switch to a different orientation date? I had to do that last year because I was moving the day mine was scheduled, and it was no problem to switch. It didn't even impact my enrollment date.",

I would recommend trying to find someone to cover your shift. \n\nRemember, you\u2019re going to school to get a better education so you can get a CAREER. It\u2019s hard to juggle both school and work priorities, but as a student, your priority should be your education. Don\u2019t let work get in the way of that. It\u2019s a lesson I learned the hard way. \n\nBest of luck to you and congrats on getting into CSUSM! It was the best and most fulfilling two years of my life.",

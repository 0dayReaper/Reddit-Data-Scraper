    "postText": "If you guys haven't bought your parking permits yet, csusm selling monthly parking permits for 80$ online. it's actually cheaper to buy by monthly right now. $80 x 3 months (sep 10 - dec 10) = 240. \n\nIts way better than paying $340 all at once. But you can't share the permit, since your license plate number is displayed on it.",

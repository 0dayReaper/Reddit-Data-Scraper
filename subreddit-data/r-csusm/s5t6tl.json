    "postText": "Hey I recently got in as a Liberal Studies major with the intent to become an Elementary teacher. From the view online it seems like a great school but I had a few questions that I can\u2019t find answers for. \n\n1. Is it a \u201cparty school\u201d? I know all schools will have parties and stuff but would it be described as a \u201cparty school\u201d?\n\n2. What are the sororities like? I\u2019m the type of girl to be in one but are most girls a part of one? Are there official houses that members live in?\n\n3. For the freshman dorms are most doubles, triples, etc.? Also for most residency halls are the bathrooms like one for the whole floor and have multiple stalls or do you share with just one other room or how are they laid out?\n\n4. If there are any Liberal Studies majors I would love to hear how the overall program is!",

I\u2019m not personally in one but some of my friends are and they like them. There are no houses for them.\n3. The dorms can hold up to 8 people I believe they are apartment style meaning there is a bathroom inside the door and a full sized kitchen. \n4. There is a liberal studies major but I don\u2019t know much about the program. I\u2019m sure if you post on the Facebook group for csusm more people will answer then on Reddit",

Went to a couple of LAN parties tho, those were cool.\n\nSororities/fraternities not really a big presence\n\nThere's two dorms, not sure about \"the Quad\" but the less \"modern\" looking dorm has a few different kinds of rooms, 6 person dorms (separated into two 1 person rooms and two 2 person rooms, but sharing a kitchen and living room and two bathrooms) or two person/one person dorms (same layout, only difference is whether there's two beds or only one, both get their own kitchen and bathroom)\n\ncan't comment, I'm CS",

It sounds like CIS itself is the issue not when you graduate?\n\nIf your not to far into your major then you shouldn't be \"off-track\" so much. Also if you decide to switch majors, you want to decide quickly. I say this because there are low lvl 300 MIS classes that are needed for you to move on, something to keep in mind.\n\nYour best bet is to drop in and see a CoBA advisor (sooner rather than later), especially before summer starts.",

            "comment": "Any class with Fang Fang is good. MIS 304 is a boring class since you don't really go too deep into anything, but it's a requirement. Her web analytics class with python is fun if you like data analytics. Professor Sun is alright, he lacks a lot of structure in his classes. He even failed to mention we would be doing SQL during a test when he specifically said it would only involve one chapter, this was for his 411 database class.\n\nCan't really say much about after graduation, but it seems past MIS students have done fairly well. Focus on getting an internship and having a project or two in your resume. Don't worry if they're basic.\n\nIf you do go the MIS route, consider joining the MIS society. People in the major tend to be socially awkward lol so it would be cool to get some more talkative people involved. The society is great tho, they're all friendly and do some cool events sometimes. Best of luck.",

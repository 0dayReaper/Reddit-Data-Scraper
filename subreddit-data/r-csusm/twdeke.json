    "postText": "California State University San Marcos is running a Cannabis Research on Use, Motives, and Behaviors (CRUMB) study focused on behavioral health and cannabis use with a short survey and a follow-up Zoom interview (you do not have to participate in both).\n\nEligibility criteria:\n\n* **18 - 25 years old**\n* **Current or graduated college student**\n* **Have used cannabis at least once in the past 30 days**\n\nSurvey link: [https://csusm.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bd2BYu0jJZGymZU](https://csusm.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bd2BYu0jJZGymZU?fbclid=IwAR0gOH10fLZKvsa6gxv0JT9yPmVsCxcI34iBwPKe-yzvPbDRNsr6dflg_PQ)\n\nThe survey is worth 1 HPP credit or 1 entry into a drawing for one of five $5 Amazon gift cards, and the interview is worth 1 HPP credit or 1 entry into a drawing for one of five $15 Amazon gift cards! Referral bonuses grant you one additional entry per referral -- the referred must write your first name and *last initial* in the \"other\" box next to \"where did you hear about this study?\" *Confidentiality is our highest priority,* but we need this information to identify you from other participants.\n\nYou may also be invited to the optional 30-minute remote interview. You must have your camera turned off, remove any pictures, change your Zoom name to a period, and not mention any identifying information.\n\nPlease message if you have any questions and thanks for your time!",

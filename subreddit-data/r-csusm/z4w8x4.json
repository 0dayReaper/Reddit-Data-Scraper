Is there a section in MyCSUSM where I can see what my FAFSA is paying for? i.e. tuition, health fees, etc. I just want to know where it\u2019s all going to and if I\u2019m going to have money left over for transportation and books, etc.",

Usually, financial aid isn\u2019t disbursed until a week or two before classes start.\n\nYou\u2019ll also usually receive a notification to your CSUSM email once they\u2019ve received/confirmed your finaid. \n\nYou can try looking at financial aid in myCSUSM and see what you were awarded. From there, you can easily subtract the tuition for full-time students (I think it\u2019s about 4-5K per semester, including all other fees). Then you can see how much you have left for transportation and books.",

I just checked the tuition for CSUSM and probably estimating 4.5k now for tuition/fees per semester. \n\nIf you got 11k for the semester (22k per year) you can probably assume that you\u2019ll have 60% for room&amp;board, transportation, and books.\n\nEdit: added link for cost of attendance breakdown for 2022-2023\n\nhttps://www.csusm.edu/finaid/costofattendance/index.html",

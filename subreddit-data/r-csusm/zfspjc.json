I heard the dorms are really nice though!\n\nYour housing will not be covered by the school, but if you applied for financial aid (FAFSA) and indicated on-campus housing, depending on you (or your parents\u2019) income, housing CAN be covered by it. \n\nOn the other hand, if you also indicated off-campus housing, FAFSA can offer a small portion for off-campus housing (YMMV). \n\nIf cost is a big issue, it might be more beneficial to stay off-campus and find a few roommates. There are forums and groups on FB that can help you connect with some others who are in a similar situation. I\u2019ve learned that people are generally really nice and social on campus, because of the fact that it\u2019s a commuter school.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, student workers at CSU San Marcos and all 23 CSUs are forming a union right now for better pay, benefits, and working conditions. Any of you guys who work on campus know that student workers are critical to keeping the university operational but are paid poverty wages with no sick time or parking benefits, and we're capped at 20 hours/week.\n\nMore than 4,000 of us from across the state filed for a union election with the labor board last month making it the biggest non-academic student workers union campaign in national history.  The CSU is trying to delay our union election so we're getting every student worker signed up on union cards to show support.\n\nIf you haven't already, join the movement and [sign your union card here](https://www.studentassistantunion.org/Reddit)!",

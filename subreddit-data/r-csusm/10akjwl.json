    "postText": "Hi there! I am planning on transferring to CSUSM this coming fall of 2023. I currently live in the San Fernando Valley so I will be moving out to the SM area. I wanted to try to live on-campus if possible so that I don't have to deal with all the traffic if I were to live somewhere off-campus. \n\n**If anyone here was/is a transfer student and moved on-campus, how was your experience? Do you think it is better to be on-campus or off-campus? Any advice you have for other transfer students?**\n\nMy only worry is that there won't really be other students my age (20) since I know freshman are required to live on campus. I also don't really know how to get into contact with other transfer students. I have recently requested both the \"CSUSM Students\" and the \"CSUSM Housing, Sublets &amp; Roommates\" group. Still waiting to be accepted by either one. \n\nIn addition, if any other transfer students for fall 2023 are looking for a roommate feel free to message me :) I am a 20 y/o female majoring in Psychological Science (BA), looking for other female roommates. \n\nIf anyone has some general advice or knowledge about my situation any response would help! Thanks.",

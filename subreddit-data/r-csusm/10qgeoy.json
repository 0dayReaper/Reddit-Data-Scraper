I am curious what the ethical argument would be for not taking responsibility for your actions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLegally there is a small chance you might get out of it. But you are not the first person to have this idea, trust me. If you look at your rental agreement I am sure it says you are responsible for any violations. The ticket will get back to them for sure and the rental agreement likely says they can just charge the card you left as a deposit.

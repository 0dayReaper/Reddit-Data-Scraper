Has registration already started, and I am just behind, or will CSUSM reach out to make when it\u2019s time for me to register. I want to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything, and am enrolling at the right time, so I get the right classes and professors. Thank you in advance!!!",

For you, looks like enrollment should start around Dec. 13",

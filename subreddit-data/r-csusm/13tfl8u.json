I know it's a big commuter school but is that really true? What do people do during the day and on weekends and stuff? Thank you!",

Some might be cringe but thats just how some school events are overall youll meet people. With that people will invite you for their own gatherings. I almost partied with different people every week till i had to get my life together and covid hit and everyone was sent home. I got to go to the safari park for 15$ with transportation included.  \n\nCar or no car there are ways to hit the beach or find a nice hike. Make friends one will most likely have a car. You network enough, SDSU has parties that are way better lol",

            "comment": "Definitely a commuter school (as you've read). Not a ton of dorm housing, but they are building more and more. I live off campus, and the commute isn't so bad. Be prepared, SoCal traffic sucks. Hard. If you want to use public transportation, create a mental checklist because it isn't the most convenient, but it isn't bad. A LOT of parking on campus, which you pay for, but be prepared to walk. It isn't a sprawling campus, but it really is beautiful. A lot of steps, and I mean a lot. \n\nFor fun, though, there's a lot to choose from. If you're transferring, I'm assuming you're under 21? No bars for you. But there's bowling and movies and a ton of restaurants. Parks. The beach. Etc. I'm repeating a lot of what's been posted, I know. But I think you'd like it. CSUSM takes pride in bringing students together for an endless variety of events and groups and get-togethers. Their social media is always current, too. Good luck!",

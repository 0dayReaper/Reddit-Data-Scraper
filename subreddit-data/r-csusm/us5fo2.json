    "postText": "First time posting on reddit, but curious to those who have had similar experiences with previous classes taken that were not transferred over, and were asked to retake the class. How did you make your statement as to why you should not have to retake it?\nI tried once already and was told no by the kinesiology advisor. For reference it is a general chemistry class. I took chem 151 worth 4 units but here it is 5 and they say i can\u2019t transfer units that dont meet the requirements, but isn\u2019t taking the class enough to meet the requirements? I have never seen a class be 5 units. Just wondering if anyone has had success in transferring over a class like that.",

            "comment": "Because Chem is a requirement for your major (kinesiology), it will only transfer if CSUSM has an Articulation Agreement for that course with the community college that you took it at.  CSUSM should give you general ed credit for the 4 units, but will still require you to take Chem at CSUSM for your major. [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) has all the articulation agreements, so you can look at it there. I just talked to my daughter's academic advisor, the director of academic advising, and the department chair for kinesiology at CSUSM and tried to get them to accept a precalc course from a community college and they all said it won't count as precalc/math 125 at CSUSM because that is a requirement of the kinesiology major. They did say it would transfer and count as general ed. My daughter is planning on taking precalc this summer, so I spent a couple hours searching on [assist.org](https://assist.org) to find the course at a community college that has an articulation agreement with CSUSM so that it will count.",

I did also have a lab. I obtained the syllabus from when I went and I sent it out to another professor in the kinesiology dept and he told me it is similar to the course taught here. And to not stop fighting it to get replaced, but im not sure how to get them to accept a course they told me to no once before",

I seem to recall them not wanting to transfer over a Native American studies course at another college I took a really long time before CSUSM because course number changed and they only had agreement with the new number but not old. I was able to get them to accept it when I sat down with someone and explained situation and showed how it really was same course",

I think at this point I\u2019ll have to retake it, i got two no\u2019s already despite being told it is similar but the required units are five so I need the 5 units. Which doesn\u2019t make sense if it is technically the same course and information taught but one unit less",

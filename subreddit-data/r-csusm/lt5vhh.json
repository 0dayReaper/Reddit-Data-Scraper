    "postText": "Hey everyone! I just wanted to give a notice that I was accepted into csusm with a 3.15 gpa. Not the best, but way better than the 1.9 gpa I had during my first year of college. I am a non-local student whose transcripts had about 4 F\u2019s and 3 W\u2019s. After a year of working on my grades I was able to fix them because of retaking classes and focusing on coursework. The reason why I am putting this out there is because I want to remind everyone whose still waiting for acceptances that it is definitely possible! I was hella stressed out, but glad I was able to make it. Wishing everyone the best \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73",

    "postText": "Hello! I had a few questions about the computer science program! Feel free to write anything about it!\n\n1. Is it hard and is there a lot of work to do?\n2. How is the vibe of the program? Is it super competitive or more friendly (if that\u2019s the right word)?\n3. Are they\u2019re clubs or study groups and how are those if you know?\n4. Anything else you\u2019d likely share\n\nTHANK YOU!!",

There were a handful of challenging classes but nothing unmanageable.\n2.\tThe vibe was pretty friendly. Though I figure that\u2019s just a matter of perspective. Who you choose to hang out with will largely determine your experience.\n3.\tThere were a few clubs when I was there. Plenty of study groups too.\n4.\tProfessor quality varies a lot. Some are great and others just plain frustrating.",

Plenty of people have graduated and now hold high salary jobs at well known companies. I would definitely say it is competitive but you should find friendly people in the major. \n\n3. There\u2019s the STEM tutor center. You can also make friends with classmates and form your own study groups. \n\n4. Be ready to grind. If you\u2019re not committed, you\u2019ll likely end up failing the degree. This goes for any college offering this degree.",

            "comment": "1. I thought some classes were easier than others, but depends on the professor. Unfortunately there will be times where the professor you get is not the best. But I\u2019ll guarantee that if you put in the effort, you will do just fine \n2. A lot of people i\u2019ve met in the major are friendly and supportive. Again this just might depend on who you decide to be around with \n3. There\u2019s cs/engineering related clubs you can join. Google Developer Student Club, IEEE, Cybersecurity, and more. You can always make friends with the people in your classes and study together. \n4. Jobs/Internships are competitive so I highly recommend doing personal projects, participate in hackathons, or getting involved in orgs. Also, I personally think getting involved and making friends with people in the major made my experience more bearable and enjoyable",

If you do not know how to solve projects, good luck getting help.  Professors I had were out for blood because of how they were treated in industry.",

            "comment": "Interesting questions. I'm the parent of a soon to be Fall 2023 CSUSM computer science major, I'm poking around here to get a feel for what he's getting into. He'll be living in the dorms, staying there most weekends I imagine. I can assure you he's supportive and friendly, won't stab anyone in the back for anything. He's ready for a challenging curriculum. I imagine he'll be looking for clubs and study groups and other like minded people with similar interests to hang out with. I know he's hoping there will be a coding club or whatever. He's not pushed the commitment button yet but will in a few days I guess and he'll probably show up on this forum looking for answers to questions. I THINK i read someplace that after he commits he may be able to unofficially tag along with some of the clubs? Not completely sure about that though. We did the student tour mid December, the STEM building is going to be demolished and rebuilt in the near future. They didn't know exactly when though but sounds like some coming improvement for the STEM students. It could have even been the CS building. Good Luck!",

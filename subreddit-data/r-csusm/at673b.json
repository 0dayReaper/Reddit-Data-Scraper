            "comment": "I want to play devil's advocate here for a second. It's kind of nice to eat in the quiet places in the library. I've done it a couple times. It's nice to do work and eat at the same time (at least for me). Sometimes there isn't room in the USU and I don't like sitting outside, especially since it has been cold lately. I don't think it is as bad as having a full on conversation in those areas. \n\nHowever, I totally get where you are coming from though. It does get annoying if you are trying to study and people are noisily eating. I just try to put in some headphones so I don't hear all the noise.",

Maybe I'd ask them to not slurp, because I eat in libraries, too! Gotta keep the energy up for studying! ",

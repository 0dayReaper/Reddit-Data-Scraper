I have tried signing up for summer courses in the past, but the amount they give you in aid isn't really enough to fully cover it (also be careful because if they disperse it to you and you don't end up taking the classes, you do have to pay them back, it's not like a financial aid refund). I've heard Palomar and Miracosta are cheaper for their summer courses, though.",

Well after drinking a whole bottle of coconut water and Campbells soup, I just noticed the water was 1 month after expiration and the soup was 1+ year after expiration.\n\nPray for me that I dont die boys ^_^",

Use by dates are more of a safety issue and you want to follow it, typically will be on meat and dairy products. Best before dates are about flavor and freshness, might not taste the best, but as long as it was stored properly, it should be safe to eat. ",

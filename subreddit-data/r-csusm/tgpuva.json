    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI have a 4.09 WGPA / 3.88 UWGPA and I have been accepted to the Global Studies Major. I was denied from CSULB and SDSU. I also want to study aboard and minor in Japanese. I feel like I can have better college and career opportunities outside of San Marcos, based on what I've read on this subreddit. I would like to ask, is this school worth it ? Cost is not an issue for me as I have the GI Bill. Honest opinions please. Thanks ! :)",

            "comment": "Go to community college first. Not because you should avoid CSUSM, but because it really sets you up for success for a 4-year school. \n\nThe first two years of school is just about you getting your lower-division general education stuff done (with a handful of classes for your major). If you do them at a 4-year, you will be sitting in a huge lecture hall with 100+ students. Sure, that's fine and all, but you said in your post that you want to have better college/career opportunities at your school. You won't really be noticed for the first few years because of those huge lecture halls. At community college, you'll be in smaller classrooms which means you have the opportunity to make connections with your profs at that CC. They might not be able to get you an awesome job, but they have more time for you regarding feedback, career advice, connections to schools (not to help you get in, but profs you can connect with over there). \n\nA few other things (from my own personal perspective, obviously):\n\n* Sometimes it can be difficult to get the classes you really want at a 4-year because they fill up so fast. That can be annoying! I never had that issue at CC (though I went to a CC in NorCal). \n* I was in your shoes a year ago. I applied to 5 CSUs and I got into all of them except for SDSU. I had a 4.0 uwgpa at my CC and I had all of the courses I needed to transfer. I think my downfall was being non-local. I appealed but I was once again denied. I accepted the offer at CSUSM and honestly? I love it here. \n* If you are looking to make friends, socialize, find a romantic partner, attend parties, etc. (which are all valid and great things!!), SDSU is probably the school you want to attend. I know that they also have more courses to offer, but you can also take them through open university. If you're looking to earn your degree within 4 years, stand out in class, make a few friends, etc., then CSUSM is a great school for that. You seem like a hard worker! Profs at CSUSM really notice the students who ask questions, show up, do good work, and they will want to help you. Perhaps SDSU is the same, who knows!\n\nI was really bummed out when I didn't get into SDSU (seriously). I wanted to go to a school that would be recognized by everyone, but it really truly doesn't matter in the end. Your grades, work, and your experience will be the thing that makes you shine. My partner is an engineer at a huge tech company and he regularly interviews candidates. When I cried to him about SDSU and how nobody will recognize CSUSM when I apply to grad school/jobs, he assured me that the school straight up does not matter. There are many candidates who come from Stanford, MIT, Yale that do not get the job.\n\nIt's very easy to get caught up in the hype of certain schools, **especially** when your peers are bragging about the schools they're getting into. I'm much older than you, but when I was in high school it was the same thing. At the end of the day, it's just a piece of paper. \n\nSo sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give you a lot of stuff to think about. It's not an easy decision! I totally get it. Best of luck to you. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. I'm not a global studies major, but I can help you with other stuff if I can. \n\n**TL;DR:** go to a CC first to get the lower div stuff out of the way and make connections there. Go to the school that will allow you to stand out and help you graduate on time. The name of the school doesn't matter when you apply for jobs; your hard work will speak for itself.",

And if worst comes to worst, you can easily re-apply to CSUSM and get in easily I'm sure. The only downside with going to community college is that your social experience may be lacking. For someone like me who went to community college, this honestly wasn't a big deal to me, and once I transferred to CSUSM, I made a ton of friends.\n\nI can't really comment on the Global Studies department here as I'm a business student. I think our business program is pretty good though. I've had some really great professors here who really do care about students and their success. You can also make friends pretty easily if you just join some clubs honestly. This was my experience though, maybe this isn't the case for everyone. At the end of the day, I'm just looking to get my degree and get my career going, so I wasn't looking for much in terms of social life on campus.  \n\n\nEdit: I guess to add a little more, CSUSM is not really a glamorous school. It's quite small, it definitely has commuter vibes. I've had a blast though with the friends I've made in my major. I think it's really what you make of it. Some might be more attracted to the big school vibes like SDSU. I'm frankly pretty complacent with CSUSM and have no complaints really.",

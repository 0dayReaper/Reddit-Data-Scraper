    "postText": "My son is an incoming freshman for the fall and was supposed to get into North Commons, but has been informed that he's on the waitlist.  Not getting in the dorms is so disappointing.  It's important to be around other freshman his year, and frankly, it was one of the main reasons for picking CSUSM (our local CSU is Fullerton) was to get the dorm experience vs. living at home.\n\nWhat's more is that they won't tell us where he is at on the waitlist, just that he is on the waitlist.\n\nAnyone else here in a similar situation?\n\nAny advice from former incoming freshmen (or parents of) that were put on the waitlist?",

Then we asked to be waitlisted to double deluxe and she put us on a long hold and said there was an opening.

He got an email on 5-4 notifying him that he was on the waitlist but not the actual placement spot. The email also stated that they would be sending \"weekly waitlist emails\" but we haven't heard anything since. \n\nUnfortunately, since we are considered \"local\" we will not be prioritized since CSUSM has a campus mandate for first-years who are outside the local admissions area only. This is a huge bummer for my son as we were hoping that he would get the first year on-campus experience and not have to commute from our home. We don't know whether we should start looking for apartments or how long to keep waiting for waitlist updates. I also didn't know that we had to apply at all three housing options to be considered for all 3. My older son went to UCLA, and they had enough housing for everyone their first year in 2018-19.",

Some people keep their intent to renew with the Quad while they look for other apartment options, and only drop out before the deadline (I don't know the exact date). \n\nSo they said that they expect more Quad spots to open up in the next couple of months as existing tenants drop their intent to renew.  By contrast, North Commons is likely full with incoming freshmen, where existing spots will only open if someone decides to attend a different school (so lower chances of that happening).\n\nOtherwise, were were told to find the CSUSM housing facebook group to find others looking for off campus roommates.",

But We decided a few days after to also apply to The Quad. They responded pretty quickly and she was approved maybe a few days after. I even asked to change rooms from double to double deluxe and she was able to do that over the phone (maybe there was an opening) So we decided to sign the paperwork bc we did not want to be without housing. And even though it\u2019s not her first choice, she is excited to have a kitchen and access to the pool, and was even able to snag the ensuite room w/ the bathroom attached to the room. Hopefully they will respond to you soon good luck \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc",

Her first choice North Commons just sent an email a few days ago to tell us we are still on the wait list, which is why we signed the paperwork already for the Quad. I would definitely call to follow up and make sure you apply to each building as a backup. I know there are quite a few freshman who are staying in the Quad as well as UVA. NC was my daughters first choice but I do like the idea of her having a kitchen in The Quad and not having to buy a huge meal\nPlan for NC",

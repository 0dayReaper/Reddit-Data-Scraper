    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m still debating between attending San Marcos, SFSU, or CSUN. I like San Marcos because it\u2019s closer to San Diego and I have a campus tour on Monday. I know it\u2019s more of a commuter school so there isn\u2019t much \u201cstudent life\u201d this is at least what I\u2019ve seen on here and other sites from students. I was wondering if anyone in the business program can give me their honest opinion?",

However, I don\u2019t think campus life is very exciting at San Marcos, but that\u2019s just me. Since it\u2019s a commuter school, a lot of students want to leave as soon as their classes are over. I\u2019ve heard great things from friends that went to SFSU, given the proximity to SF (~15 mins from downtown) and all the things there are to do there. Public transport is a bit better there, so you wouldn\u2019t be as reliant on a car to get from A to B. CSUSM is about 35 mins from downtown SD on a good day. San Marcos is still very much a suburb, so if you\u2019re looking for a more lively area, I\u2019d opt for SF. Of course, you should take costs into consideration, but afaik costs of living are almost equal between SF and SD at the moment. Weather may also be a factor for you. In terms of the business program, it\nmay be useful to be in a major business hub like SF (maybe for future internships, connections, etc.)",

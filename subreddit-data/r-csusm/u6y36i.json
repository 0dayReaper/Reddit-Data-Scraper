I promise neither one is going to give you a real advantage post graduation.  Just get the degree and if it's related to the work you apply for, that's a bonus.",

            "comment": "I think you might be referring to the Social Science degree with a focus on psychology. For that program, you will have a primary field (in your case, psychology) and two secondary fields (could be anthro, sociology, border studies, etc.). So you would be looking at many different social issues through many different lenses. I don't think this program requires you to take any \"extra\" courses, as in more than 120 units required for graduation. You *will* have to choose two secondary fields, so if it's only psychology that you're interested in, you may as well choose psychological sciences instead. \n\nAre you coming to CSUSM as a transfer or a freshman? If you're coming in as a freshman, you will have almost two years to really figure out what you love. The first two years is when you get through all of your general education requirements, and spend a little less time on your major. Since both of them have similar lower division course requirements for the psychology part, you have time and you can just pick one or the other right now. They both require PSYC 100 (intro), 220 (stats), and 230 (research). Those are the three classes you need in order to move onto the upper division psych courses. \n\nI highly recommend meeting with an advisor about this as they will have a lot of great advice for you!",

You can look at the [worksheet here](https://www.csusm.edu/academicadvising/majorminor/worksheets/ss/ss_psyc.pdf) and determine if you think it looks less intensive than the [psychological science worksheet](https://www.csusm.edu/academicadvising/majorminor/worksheets/psyc/psyc.pdf). Hopefully someone can give you some personal insight regarding that route! \n\nDo you know what you want to do with that degree? Totally cool if you don't, but it may help you make a decision. With the social science major, you'd need to choose a primary focus and then two secondary fields of focus.",

I\u2019m a psyc major too but was advised to look into majoring in SSCI w/emphasis in psyc due to health complications I\u2019m experiencing. Frankly, the lab portions and biopsyc seem pretty daunting. I was able to look at the advising sheets for both majors and Social Science seems like it will require more theory and discussion/less studying if I\u2019m not mistaken.\nI guess that\u2019s what I mean when I say less demanding, just referring more to the reading/studying portion.",

Biopsych is such a hard class so I can understand your concern. It looks like if you did switch to SSCI, you wouldn't have to take biopsych (you could take cognitive psych instead!). Wishing you all the best!",

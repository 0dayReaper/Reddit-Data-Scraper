    "postText": "it seems that they are considering closing the university but after spring break. They are just trying to get through these 2 weeks and after that, they might just have everything online. However there are still uncertainties regarding labs which will hopefully be figured out in the days to come. Basically it\u2019s just a matter of time until CSUSM goes fully online like the others.",

I honestly hope it happens since a lot of people go to classes even when they're sick so they aren't penalized for missing too many days.",

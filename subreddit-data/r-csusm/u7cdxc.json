As of now they\u2019re only doing phone consultations so I\u2019m pretty apprehensive to reach out bc phone bad phone scary blah blah blah, but if they\u2019re any good I\u2019d be willing to try. Also do they do diagnoses?? A girl b curious",

            "comment": "I saw the CSUSM psychiatrist for 4 years for meds (fall 2014 - spring 2018) and then did weekly therapy sessions for 1 year during my senior year. I had a great experience with both. My therapist was an intern working on her PhD and we really connected so I ended up doing weekly sessions for the entire year instead of just a few visits. It helped me out a lot and I think I\u2019m a much more well-grounded person thanks to the sessions. I didn\u2019t pay anything for the therapy and the psych visits were like $15 out of pocket per appointment.\n\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I also used the campus health center for many other acute problems I had throughout my time at CSUSM (injuries, STD treatment, etc). No complaints at all.",

Try looking for summer sessions to get Chem done, CC have summer sessions and cheap.\n\nFor CSUM you can take classes through their open university or through your school portal where you can take classes at other universities online as long as the class you are looking for is available. The credits automatically transfer to your transcript.\n\nHere is the link: [https://www.csufullyonline.com/](https://www.csufullyonline.com/) \n\nIt offers upper and lower division courses @ all CSU's.",

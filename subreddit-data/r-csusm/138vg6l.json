I know most people respond to this question with the fact that it's a commuter school and everyone treats it like a job, get in and get out. But for anyone who has done on-campus living and has easier access to on-campus events or bigger social circles with roommates, is it anything closer to the \"college experience\"?",

Roommates are always wild cards cuz you truly never know them till you the third or fourth month in. Campus events are usually fun but go with a good attitude. You already lose it when you have bad thoughts going in. Get involved and follow the instagram pages. You can get some nice deals/events like rock climbing for 20 bucks or the safari park for 10.\n\nEdit: sdsu has better parties lol",

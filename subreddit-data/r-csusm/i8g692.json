    "postText": "I am trying to get an idea of whether or not it would be possible to get my mother a roommate to share her three-bedroom house in Discovery Hills area of San Marcos, between Lake San Marcos and Discovery Lake, 3 miles from Cal State. The tenant would have two smallish bedrooms, their own bathroom, one garage parking space (lots of storage in the garage as well), full use of the kitchen, living room, patio, and in-house gym. No need for a gym membership or risking going to the gym during COVID. This house is my mom's dream home and would be heartbroken to lose it. Unfortunately, she can no longer afford the rent on her own. It would be perfect for a CSUSM student.",

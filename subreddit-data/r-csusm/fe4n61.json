I\u2019m an alumni now and I would suggest joining the gaming club and the anime club as other have suggested. Also, if you take classes that are more aligned with your major, you\u2019ll see a lot of the same people in your classes and often times they have group projects. Those are the times when you can make great friends as you struggle through the adversity and work that the professors give you together lol. Best of luck!",

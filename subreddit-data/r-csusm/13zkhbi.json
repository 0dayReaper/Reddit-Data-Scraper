    "postText": "Hi everyone! \nI wanted to know if anyone was aware of any leadership and internship opportunities for students in STEM who are considering Veterinary Medicine as a career after graduation. I'm a recent transfer student, majoring in Biological Sciences, and I don't know much about the student organizations here or which professors are knowledgeable in vet med. I've already registered for the Fall 2023 student organization fair as well. Any clarification or insight would be greatly appreciated! &lt;3",

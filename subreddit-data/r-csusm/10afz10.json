I also am about to get my ADT. What are my chances into getting in CSUSM as a transfer? and i\u2019m a local going for psychology.",

Not sure if that's still the case.",

I forget which ones. They told us during online orientation a year and a half ago. My memory's fuzzy. I didn't pay attention because I was from Palomar.\n\n(For clarity's sake, I transferred from Palomar to CSUSM in 2006, dropped out, went back and took classes at Palomar again to get back in the groove in 2019, and transferred again with no issue. The only difference was my History 103/104 classes stopped being valid over that long break and since you can't retake a class you've gotten a C in or higher, I had to take a different pair of history classes instead.)",

The main factor will be how many apply the same year you do and among those, how many will be infront of you in terms of having a higher probablity of getting accepted ( i.e. gpa, local vs. non-local, how many apply to your respective major, is your major impacted that year........on and on.....)\n\nyour best chance will be to apply to as many schools as you can.\n\nAgian, this is not a troll post\n\nIt is the realistic and most honest answer you will get",

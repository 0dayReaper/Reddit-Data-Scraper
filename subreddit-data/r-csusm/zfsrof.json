It\u2019s pretty casual since Oceanside isn\u2019t super nice but not is it super ghetto. It\u2019s gentrifying recently though. \n\nThe next beach down, Carlsbad, is a more affluent area and is also a good beach. Not as good for surfing because it\u2019s a beach break but the beaches are nicer and so is the downtown area.",

They just leave once their classes are done for the day. Your best bet for beaches would be UCSC OR UCSB.",

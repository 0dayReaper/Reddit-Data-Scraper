I'm looking to do work along the lines of translation, editing, journalism or maybe even public relations of some sort. I finished my associates degree at Mira Costa college and csusm would be so much closer to home but I'm not sure what's the best choice and I feel so lost! Please help thank you",

            "comment": "As a Psychology (now Social Sciences: Psychology) major, I went with CSUSM because SDSU is way too big for me. As in: the classes are SO stuffed that you don\u2019t get assignments. Only quizzes and tests, and you don\u2019t get to know your classmates, work together, or get to know your professor and are rarely able to ask questions and interact. Now this may just be in psych classes and GE classes, but that\u2019s not how I learn. CSUSM is more personal. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest going to both campuses. SDSU felt distant and cold to me. And CSUSM felt like home. But you might have a different experience! :) good luck!!!",

The class checks both of those boxes for you. Very straightforward class -- no exams, just a weekly writing assignment and forum posts. Professor Lawston will be the instructor this summer. She's awesome. \n\nHappy to send you the syllabus if you are interested. I took her class this past winter and it was great. She's quick at grading and gives feedback which I appreciate.",

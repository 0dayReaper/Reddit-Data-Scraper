It might also be easier to find a job in sd if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to do in the future. I\u2019m also not too familiar with CPP\u2019s business school, but if they have any programs that make them better than CSUSM, I\u2019d look into that but besides that I don\u2019t think going to CSUSM would be a big disadvantage.",

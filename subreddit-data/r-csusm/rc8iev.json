    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am starting Spring 22 as a transfer student. I\u2019m aware of how to enroll/the process, but I was confused as the email I received (for my enrollment date) also included this:\n\n\u201cHow to Enroll the Cougar Way:\n\n1. View the Enrollment Tutorial\n2. Attend the Enroll the Cougar Way Workshop on December 15th\n3. Log-in to MyCSUSM on your assigned date to enroll!\u201d\n\nMy question is: Do we need to attend the \u201cCougar Way Workshop\u201d (via zoom) before enrolling? It didn\u2019t specify if it is required and since my enrollment time is the same time as the workshop I\u2019d rather just enroll.\n\nAny info would be great! :)",

            "comment": "Hello fellow PSYC major! I'm a new transfer but I started this past fall! \n\nAs far as I remember, Enroll the Cougar Way isn't mandatory, but it doesn't hurt to take it. I think I learned a few odds and ends taking it over the summer. It doesn't take very long. \n\nBefore I recommend any classes, do you have the three lower-division requirements? I'm sure you have PSYC 101, but do you have Stats for the Psych Major and Research/Methods with lab? If so, you should be able to register for a ton of classes. \n\nI highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Gonzalez! I took his Film and Mental Health class this fall and it was awesome. I'm taking his Abnormal Psych class next semester (which still has availability as I type this). \n\nThere's still a lot of classes left, but many of them have certain pre-reqs that you might not have just yet. If you find that you don't have much of a variety of Psych classes this semester, I would suggest working on other graduation requirements such as the second language requirement, or the upper-division math/science, the social science, and the humanities requirement. That's what I did in my first semester because my registration date was kind of like yours: left with slim pickings! ;-) I also suggest checking [this page](https://www.csusm.edu/enroll/enrollment/spring_2022/new_courses.html) daily because they add new classes randomly before the semester begins. That's how I was able to register for Positive Psych last minute last semester! :-) \n\nLook into if you qualify for California Promise! You'll probably get an email about it if you qualify, and if you do, you will get a sweet registration date for Fall! \n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any other questions! Welcome to CSUSM!",

                    "comment": "Hi, I appreciate all the information! I am planning to take stats for psych this spring and I did complete the other two prior to transferring :) my research methods did include a lab so I\u2019m pretty sure I should be complete with that too. I guess my options just felt slim more due to the fact I was hoping to go fully online for spring 22 and am hoping I can still do so. I will definitely check out the other classes for grad requirements (it slipped my mind I have those available haha I\u2019ve been so focused on the core psych) and thanks for including that link, this info is so helpful to me I was getting a bit worried about enrollment since mine isn\u2019t until dec 15. I\u2019ll definitely check out everything thanks again! I look forward to starting at CSUSM :)",

If you click on the links to each requirement, it'll list all of the classes that meet those reqs. I hope that helps!\n\nI've had to do a lot of my own research on requirements. I think the only downside to CSUSM (or any 4-yr college) versus community college is academic advisors don't really spend quality time with you the way advisors do in CC. If you need any help, like I said, feel free to reach out!",

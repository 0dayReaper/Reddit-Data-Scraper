            "comment": "I didn't live on campus, but I walked around it enough to see the path to the nearby dorms.\n\nThe dorms are RIGHT THERE. Easy walking distance. You don't have to struggle with parking (unless you want to?) or fuss with parking permits (unless they force you to get one in the dorms). There's a small convenience store on campus where you can do basic grocery shopping. At least one path that stretches between class halls and the dorms goes over the street so you don't have to wait for a traffic light.\n\nAlso, about a block from the dorms is the Sprinter rail, which can take you up the freeway (the 78) either all the way to the coast in Oceanside or east to the bus station in Escondido. There's a bunch of stops along that thing if you need to go somewhere without a car. Hell, take the tram to the coast and you can take another one down to Downtown San Diego if you want.\n\nWalking distance is minuscule. Carting books around isn't too much of a problem.\n\nOne con they made very clear in orientation was \"no weed.\" You stay there, no weed allowed. I thought that kind of blowed but it's their rules, so... Yeah. The convenience store doesn't carry everything a grocery store does so you might need to make a trip to one off-campus anyway. It's Southern California housing so it's going to probably be PRICEY.\n\nI didn't actually live there so I'm probably missing a lot, but I commuted from Escondido both in the mid-2000s and 2021, so I've seen it with and without dorms. The kids in those dorms have it pretty nice compared to everyone commuting before.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Very much a commuter school, yeah. I don't personally live on campus, but I have met many people who do. From what I hear, it's not a bad situation at CSUSM, and the dorms are very conveniently placed in respect to the campus.\n\nIf you want pros and cons for the school, here's what I can give you:\n\n**Pros**: \n\n* Nice location (in my opinion). The immediate area isn't too glamorous, but you can take the tram out to the beach or take a short drive Escondido\n* Very compact campus, easy to get around, but still lots of places to hangout and chill between classes.\n* Obviously, not too expensive especially after aid.\n* There are plenty of events always going on. Enough to keep you entertained if you live on campus, whether it be workshops or a music event. You'll find stuff to do if you're open to trying new things.\n* The student body isn't as big as a lot of other schools, so you'll most likely have lots of opportunities to interact with the same people throughout different classes. \n\n**Cons:**\n\n* The campus life isn't anything to write home about, especially because it's a commuter school. Sure there are plenty of events, but the school lacks a lot of spirit, because many people just commute, take their classes, and go home.\n* Lots of stairs (there are plenty of elevators though)\n* The parking situation can get pretty bad. If you show up for a later class during peak hours (like a 1pm), it can be hard to find parking.\n* The traffic around the school is horrible, both on the streets and on the 78.",

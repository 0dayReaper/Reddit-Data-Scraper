I was looking for a club of the sort, but there doesn't seem to be one, is anyone interested in starting something like that? I know the writing center can be a place to find people who like to write, but I'm talking more about artistic endeavors rather than academic. Cheers!",

I would look online, or visit the department office maybe to inquire about it. If not, maybe you can start your own!",

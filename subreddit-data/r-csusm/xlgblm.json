I've noticed on multiple occasions that when I'm approached by one of these people, they'll often misrepresent what the signatures are being collected for. Sometimes it's literally the opposite of what's actually written on the paper. Just something to keep that in mind when approached next time!",

Recently when told one of these guys \"No, I'm not interested\", he got all mad and \"accidentally\" slammed down his whole stack of clip boards on the table I was sitting at while passive-aggressively saying \"have a nice day\"",

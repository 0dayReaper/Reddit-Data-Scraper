I'm currently taking 341 and I really love the class/material. I think the professor is the main reason why, though. If you are taking 341, try to take Mendoza.. he's a gem.",

Every exam is based off of lecture material.. I never needed the textbook. In lectures, he heavily emphasizes the exam material so pay attention. I still have all my lecture notes uploaded to my drive in case you'd like them :)",

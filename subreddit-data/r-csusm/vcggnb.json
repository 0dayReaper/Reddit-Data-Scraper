They are designed to welcome you to campus, let you know about resources, give you info (like advising), and introduce you to your major. It helps to onboard students and provides them with a chance to ask questions and learn more about the university. Sure some of it might be a pain, but it is what you make of it (just like college). So, if you go in with an attitude that it is a waste of time, it likely will be. If you see it as an opportunity to learn some things, help get yourself prepared, and perhaps meet some people, you will likely enjoy it more.",

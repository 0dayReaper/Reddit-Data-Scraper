I hear too many people complain about the lack of spirit and the atmosphere of this school. So can anyone confirm? how true or wrong the complaints are? I'm an introvert so i'm not particularly looking for a party school but I do want the \"college experience\". Make some friends and memories while i try to get a nursing degree yk? What's campus life like?",

I also occasionally chat with current students that I\u2019ve met at off-campus events in recent years.\n\n\nIn my opinion, I think COVID really screwed over a lot of social opportunities on campus. Despite CSUSM being a \u201ccommuter school\u201d and all, it\u2019s still always been possible to reach out and hang with people, but it seems to have gotten a lot harder as of late. It also doesn\u2019t seem that CSUSM is very interested in expanding the social dynamics on campus with their current policies in place, but I would love to be proven wrong in the future.\n\n\nHate to be a bummer, but I think the post-COVID \u201ccollege experience\u201d just really isn\u2019t the same anymore no matter where you go (in California at least).",

All the normal stuff is available, support groups, activities, sororities and fraternities, etc. you might actually make close friends in class because they\u2019re small and not 100 people (well, besides the 100/101 classes lol)",

You can find people but again, there\u2019s not much to do around san marcos either other than maybe the beach? Even that gets old tho. And even if u go to a frat party, they\u2019re far from campus and definitely not worth going as they have the same vibe as a school dance with a shitty dj. I will say they have some nice trails and the beach is pretty and they\u2019re train transportation is pretty nice (i have a car tho so i barely used it). Definitely a commuter school. Also they don\u2019t pay their staff well at all so they\u2019re always short staffed. The programs, however, are kinda helpful like TRIO SSS with their emergency grants and counselors. It\u2019s just not a campus i like",

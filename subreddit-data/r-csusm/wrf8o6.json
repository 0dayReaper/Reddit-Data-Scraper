    "postText": "Hey! Due to my financial situations I wanted to take a gap semester. I read on the schools website that it\u2019s called a \u201cout-one term\u201d. I\u2019ve already completed two terms at CSUSM as a freshman (now entering my sophomore year). \n\nHow do I request to \u201cout-one term\u201d? I\u2019ve only seen on the website a form for people that have exhausted their leave of absence so I\u2019m a little confused. \n\nAre there any other requirements I need to worry about?\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken a gap semester before, how was it? Any advice?\n\nThank you in advanced!",

I have however looked into this at my university as I'm in a similar financial situation, I spoke with my academic advisor (opposed to a department specific advisor) who in short told me that if I needed to take a year to make money that \"we'd get it sorted out\" that being said I'd also recommend reaching out to your dean of students if anything to show you're covering all your bases for the record. That all being said the policy might differ for your university. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "I want to ask that can you walk first before u get the degree?\nTechnically i'm going to complete all my major course in Fall 2023 but for fall 2023, i only have to take 3 courses (12 credits). So because of that i just want to ask that can i walk in Spring 2023 instead of waiting until may 2024. Also for the credit, by spring 2023, I already got more than 120.\nThank you",

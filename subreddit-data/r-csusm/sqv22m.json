There's paid parking stations right outside PS1 (parking structure 1) and the north/south corners of Lot F. it costs $9 for all-day parking until 11:59 PM. I would say your best bet for taking good shots of people with cool stuff going on would be during U-hour, which is Tuesday and Thursday from 12 PM to 1 PM around the Student Union and Kellogg Library. If you're not much of a camera-people-shooty person, Palm Court between Academic Hall and University Hall is scenic and usually pretty quiet.",

There are 90 minute spots for \u201cretail parking only\u201d on Levels 1-2, but absolutely no one is going to check for validation, it\u2019s also a CSUSM parking spot on Levels 2-6 so be careful or you can get ticketed.",

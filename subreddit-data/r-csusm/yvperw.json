I imagine there must be hundreds of people on the waitlist. With that being said, should I ever expect to get in? I\u2019m thinking that it might take a few semesters, if I can ever get in at all.",

It's based on what's available when they get to your name on a list, it's not in order of who applied first. That's what I understood from how it was worded anyway. So if there's a studio open when they get to processing your application, it'll be offered to you. \n\nIf my understanding is correct, then it's based on pure chance. Hopefully you're lucky enough when they get to your application :)",

How\u2019s living on campus btw? I\u2019m aware that the school is no SDSU but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s too bad. Would you say that moving into the studio has been worth it?",

You get to see the prettiest sunsets. \n\nOther than some really noisy neighbors, my experience living in a studio dorm has been wonderful. Definitely worth it - I think what you get for the price is excellent, considering what the current housing market looks like. \n\nGood luck, hope you get what you're after!",

You can go through your whole time on campus avoiding people and keeping to yourself, if that's what you choose. \n\nComing from 200 miles away and not knowing anyone in the area, I chose to make the best of it. I talk to the people next to me in class and try to join conversations I see happening after class. Becoming friends with the people you share classes with is great, because you know you'll see them every week. You might even make a friend just talking to someone in line at Starbucks. It doesn't take much. If you're a decent person to be around, which I'm sure you are - most people are willing to have a chat with you. Sometimes you have to start the conversation or get involved, which isn't always easy - but again, it comes down to if you wanna make the most of things. \n\nI didn't think I'd be able to make friends at first either, I was worried coming here alone. Now I see people I know around campus everyday, and they're very cool people :)\n\nI have been to one club meeting and know nothing about Greek life, not involved in that at all. \n\nAnd if you'll be here next semester - let me know and I can show you around campus sometime! Seriously, I love showing people what this campus has to offer. I'd love to show you all the cool study spots and resources available to you :)",

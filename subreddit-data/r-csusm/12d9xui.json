            "comment": "CSUSM is not really a party school. It's mainly a commuter school, so most people simply come for their classes and leave when they're done. There are a good amount of events held on campus, and there are some parties, but you'd be better off driving down to SDSU.\n\nThat being said, this is what makes it a great school to really focus on your education. If you're the type who doesn't party much, then this will make it a great school for you. It's very straightforward; cut and dry. And again, if you only party now and then, there are a few parties, or you can go down to SDSU on the weekends.\n\nIf you *really* like to party **a lot**, then it's probably not the best school for that.",

                    "comment": "I appreciate your response, I want to focus on education and have a good non distracting environment for that during the week. Although I still want the college experience and a social life. The schools I got accepted into ended up all being the most dry campuses when it comes to partying. From reading online it seems like this is the closest to a social life than Channel islands, Dominguez, and CSUN. I don't mind traveling to SDSU area and Encinitas to have a social life but i really have no option but to choose San Marcos unless I want to go to a 2 year, but 2 years don't usually have a party scene or social life. I do have a question with the whole SDSU students and CSUSM students, do we get looked down upon by a lot? Is it easy to get invited to parties at SDSU even If I attend CSUSM?",

Its not a PE class like you're thinking of, its a class that teaches future educators how to teach PE to kids and why it is important from a developmental level. That being said its 1hr a week of lecture and 1 hr a week of \"lab\" which is held in the gym and you do the activities that kids would be doing. Its pretty easy.",

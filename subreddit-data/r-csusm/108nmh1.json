You can also check which classes transfer on your own here https://www.assist.org/. I ended up following IGETC in case I wanted to transfer to a UC\n\nhttps://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/\n\n\nGood luck.",

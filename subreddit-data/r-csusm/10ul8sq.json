Don't wait--the longer you wait the less likely it is they'll let you.\n\nI recommend attending the class you want to add in person and speaking with the professor afterwards. If you e-mail or call them I can 90% guarantee they'll either say no or ignore you.",

The automated systems are all designed to just say no, but you can easily work around it if the professor is fine with you joining.\n\nThis is also true for classes that are *full* btw. I got into two full classes because I just showed up every day for the first week and the professor just let me in.\n\nThis is not true for all professors. Just a lot of them.",

They\u2019ve also been known to do it because a professor won\u2019t teach at that time. It\u2019s so dumb because they will say they are not liable for the inconvenience it caused you. Made me have a 5 hour gap in between classes. I either ended up studying during the downtown or going to the bars, haha.",

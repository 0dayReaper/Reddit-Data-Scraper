To be honest, the business analytics track falls under the same department/umbrella (Operations and Supply Chain Management Department) as the supply chain management track as well. You\u2019ll cover supply chain management heavily in the BA track. \n\nIf you have more questions about this, feel free to PM me!\n\nEdit: to further elaborate, you\u2019re essentially going to be graduating with a business degree, which is why you aren\u2019t able to add any other business tracks as a minor. It would be really redundant, as your degree would say Major in Business Admin and minor in Business Admin.",

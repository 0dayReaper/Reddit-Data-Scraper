They followed the CSU guideline which followed the state guideline which followed the federal guideline which followed what the rest of the world has been doing.  Everyone is SUPER freaking sensitive here...i mean, it is reddit...but as I said, I have no problems with vaccines and will probably get covid vax like I do with the flu shot at some point, but certainly not until it's all ironed out.  The fact of the matter is that by percentage, healthy young people dont die from this and have the best chance to build up natural immunities.  None of the numbers out there are right since trump picked a side...everything is now muddled between people that died OF covid and people that died WITH covid.",

You mention percentages and statistics but I seriously doubt you could find legitimate studies that support what you're saying. The truth is that the vaccinations, despite some initial hiccups, have always been safer statistically for adults than catching covid without it.",

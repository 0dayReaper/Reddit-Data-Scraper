    "postText": "I'm planning to apply for Spring 2023, but I'm quite unsure of my chances of getting in. I originally went to palomar and MSJC, then I got an AD-T for History but I want to transfer into CSUSM as a Lit Major. I got admitted to SDSU but I ended up having to withdraw, now I'm trying to attend CSUSM instead because it's closer to home.",

The only other thing I'm curious on is CSUSM keeps saying I have to send official transcripts from all schools I attended, but since I withdrew SDSU very early into the semester they say they have no records of me. So is there even anything to send to them?",

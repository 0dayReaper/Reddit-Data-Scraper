He's super cool, very helpful, easy 4 hour class with 10 minute breaks every hour, he made everything fairly interesting and best of all - Mythbusters and Movies !",

            "comment": "I've posted an answer to someone else that asked this question a couple months ago, so I figured I'd copy/paste my response because I can't recommend these two classes enough:\n\n&gt;Oh! Take Anthropology 330 with Dr Carlisle! The class was called Ritual and Religion. The lectures are amazing, the Dr is super passionate about his work, and there\u2019s 3 \u2018field trips\u2019 to different religious centers where you can ask a rep questions. We went to a Muslim Mosque, a Jewish Synagogue, and a Creationism Museum.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm not the least bit religious and had been recommended to take the class on a whim, and quite frankly, I don\u2019t regret it. You learn a lot about other cultures and how these religions evolved. Really interesting stuff.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another one I recommend that\u2019s super informative and fairly easy is Geography 450 Parks and Protected Areas with Professor Ridder. I learned a lot about the importance of conservationism and the history of state and national parks and their legislation. You get to do 6 journals where you basically go to a park or protected area to chill for 20 minutes, observe everything you see, hear, touch, smell, and record it in a journal to be turned into the professor. She is also very passionate about her work and is a super great professor.",

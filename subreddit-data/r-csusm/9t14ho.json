    "postText": "So, you've got into CSUSM! Yay! Not really, they let anyone in. That's okay though, what you choose to do with the opportunity is what matters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA run down for CSIS majors, you will need to take the following classes:\n\n\\- CS111\n\n\\- CS211 (pre-req to CS311)\n\n\\- CS231 (Pre-req to CS433. One should take this around CS311 instead of CS211, trust me.)\n\n\\- CS311 (pre-req to pretty much all the upper level CS400 level classes)\n\n\\- MATH160 (pre-req to CS311)\n\n\\- MATH242 \n\n\\- MATH270 \n\n\\- CS433\n\n\\- CS436\n\n\\- CIS444\n\n\\- CIS341\n\n\\- CS443\n\n\\- CS441\n\n\\- CIS490\n\n\\- CS Elective (make sure chosen class is eligible)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not covering any other classes besides these ones. There are other classes you need to take, but this is the core chunk of classes. I am not covering the 302s, you can fill those in accordingly to your schedule. Remember the pre-requisites required for all the 302s. If I have missed any, please let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what you want to take in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFall Freshman 1st Semester:\n\n\\- CS111\n\n\\- MATH160\n\nTips: Learn CS111 WELL. Do not be lazy, do not cheat. If you don't understand something or cut corners - drop out of the major now and save yourself some time. You will struggle in other classes like CS311 and CS433 that build upon basic C++.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpring Freshman 2nd Semester:\n\n\\- CS211\n\n\\- MATH270\n\nTips: Learn CS211 well. It is not difficult, but it will be challenging especially to new programmers. If you cut corners here, you will do poorly in CS433. Also, READ the textbook for Math 270. I cannot emphasize this enough. You start reading the textbook from the VERY FIRST DAY OF CLASS, the class will be a breeze for you. Additionally, by reading, I mean understanding the concepts, doing the practice problems, etc. If you choose not to follow this, you will do poorly in MATH 270 and will have to retake it. Be smart, save yourself a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, get the powerpoints for CS231 from a classmate to help you prepare for Sophomore year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFall Sophomore 1st Semester:\n\n\\- CS231\n\n\\- MATH242\n\n\\- CS311\n\nTips: CS231 will be very difficult - the material is not hard but the professor is miserable and will play favorites. If you can get the powerpoints ahead of time from peers, read them ahead of time during your summer intersession. Again, when I say read, do not just read - code. Practice every little thing that you see. Every slide is important, so do not cut corners. You should know how to code in assembly as well as binary math, conversion, etc. Circuit design, Truth Tables, Karnaugh Maps are all your bread &amp; butter for CS231. If you study all of these, you will pass. If you don't, you will fail and this professor will not hesitate to humiliate you in the process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS311 - a lot of people get their code from GitHub in this class. DO NOT DO THIS. You should understand and do the code yourself. Yoshii and the other professors who borrow her material make this class very easy. If you cannot do it - you are not paying attention in class and you are not taking the prerogative of learning on your own time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMATH242 - read the textbook, do every single homework problem. This should be your easier class out of the other 3. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpring Sophomore 2nd Semester:\n\n\\- CS443 - Most people get their assignments from GitHub. DO NOT DO THIS. Hadaegh pulls tricks and will call you out. Additionally, if you cut corners - you will fail the class. Do the labs, do the assignments ON YOUR OWN. Everything that you need to do these will be covered in the PowerPoints, so make sure to read and understand the PowerPoints extremely well.\n\n\\- CS436 - Again, most people get their assignments from GitHub. DO NOT DO THIS. This has become a recurring thing, have you noticed? The reason why I say this for this class is that it makes the labs difficult for you. If, somehow, you cheat during the labs, you are not helping yourself as for the exams you have to be very fast at binary conversion of IP addressing. If you follow the PowerPoints for Majd, Springer, or the new professor (asian dude), you will be fine.\n\n\\- CIS341 - Easiest CIS class ever. Margo Lopez is not adequately equipped to handle this class &amp; does not have all the necessary information. Read the textbook, memorize and you will ace the exams. Very straight forward, back to high school sort of class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFall Junior 1st Semester:\n\n\\- CIS444 - Read the textbook for this class FROM DAY ONE. Wu does not teach well and this course is content-heavy. You will learn a lot of languages very quickly so do not be lazy. If you do, you will suffer and fail this class.\n\n\\- CS433 - Take Springer if you can. This is a very challenging class, so textbook reading and being on top of the class from day one is important. Heck, if you can prepare yourself during the winter or the summer then do so. That extra preparation will be well worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpring Junior 2nd Semester:\n\nUse this semester to take your 302s. This is also the semester you will want to build on other CS languages and skills on your own time so you can be ready to apply for jobs. I recommend learning &amp; refreshing on: HTML, JS Client-Side, PHP, Python, and Databases\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFall Senior 1st Semester:\n\n\\- CS441 - Find a good group that is not lazy, knows what they are doing and you will be golden. The languages and skills that you learned in your Junior 2nd Semester will come in handy here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpring Senior 2nd Semester:\n\n\\- CIS490 - Again, find a good group that is not lazy, knows what they are doing and you will be golden. The languages and skills that you learned in your Junior 2nd Semester will come in handy here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to beat this major - you will need to get good at reading/practicing the book for every class. Doing this ahead of time is preferable as it will help you time manage more efficiently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It does build though so if you choose to be lazy in the beginning, you will pay for it in every class you take thereafter pertaining to the major. Unfortunately, many students do not understand this until it is too late. Once this occurs, it is a very difficult process to reverse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

One can use the degree planner to figure out how to organize each class. I do recommend taking 231 &amp; 311 together though instead of 231, 211, and 270 in the same semester. Most students will do the latter and struggle through all three classes equally. ",

Select your college in the second drop down.\n  1. Select CSUSM in the first drop down.\n  1. Select the most recent year where the agreement is valid in the first drop down. For the CC I went to, the most recent year is 2021-2022. It's fine if it's a year or three old.\n1. Select 'General Education / Breadth' radio button in the 'View Agreement' pane on the left.\n1. Click the link that says 'CSU GE BREADTH'.\n1. Open the PDF.\n1. Scroll down to 'Written Communication' 'CSU GE Area: A2 - Written Communication'\n1. Take one of the classes written there. (at most schools there's probably just going to be one)\n\nThe written communication is usually going to be English 100 or 101 class, or English 1A or something like that. It is NOT going to be Communications 100 or 101. Communications 100/101 may fulfill 'CSU GE Area: D0 - Sociology and Criminology'.\n\nThe articulation agreement between your school and CSUSM is your guide throughout this whole thing. You need to follow the articulation agreement for both the GE Breadth and the major you want to have at CSUSM. If your college does not have an articulation agreement with CSUSM, for instance in step 1.1. above your college isn't there, or if the 'CSU GE BREADTH' option is greyed out in step 3, you've got a *lot* of work ahead of you. You will *not* be able to sort it out with just this subreddit's help, you will need to spend a *lot* of quality time with your advisor.",

I was able to transfer over 80 credits to San Marcos! \n\nAlso please finish all the prereq stuff in the IGETC that is localized to your degree, this will allow you to go right into lvl 300 and 400 courses right away at CSUSM! I have already talked to people and they are still in lvl 200 stuff for their major, easier to save money if you can just crank it out. \n\nIf you need more help or more clarification, I am down to help you out! just lmk",

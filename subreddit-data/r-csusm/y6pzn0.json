I loved that there were so many scenic spots to just settle down to study, eat, hangout w friends, etc. i liked that the class sizes were smaller making class more intimate and easier to communicate with the professor. Lastly I liked how central is was to a lot of stuff (food, scenery, housing)",

It's expensive and the cheapest option has you park in dirt lots, but at least it's not too far away from the campus. Plus, traffic can be a pain when leaving campus, mostly around 4-5 pm. There were no options for online classes this semester, yet many classes don't have attendance required and already have videos recorded for lectures?! Finally, the internet can suck at times and I can't even connect to the actual network with my Pixel.\n\nIt's an okay school with cheap tuition. I hope they bring back online classes.",

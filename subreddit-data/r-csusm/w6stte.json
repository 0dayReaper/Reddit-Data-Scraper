    "postText": "Since I am a chemistry major I signed up for the STEM freshman orientation on August 9th from 8am to 8pm. I\u2019m kind of worried because 12 hours sounds like a long time. I know that there will be a lunch break in the middle, but I\u2019m not sure whether or not I will have to stay the whole time. For those who attended this specific orientation, what was it like? What kinds of things did you do? I just want to know what to expect. Thanks!",

My orientation was 6 hours, you could leave whenever you want, and no lunch break. Based off my transfer orientation, it\u2019s pretty lax.",

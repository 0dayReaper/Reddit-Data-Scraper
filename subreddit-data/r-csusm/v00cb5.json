    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m transferring to CSUSM this fall from Palomar and have yet to actually go to the campus and see what it\u2019s like or where all the buildings are. All I know is based off of the map. Basically I have 3 classes on a certain day with there being a 15 minute gap between them. The first one is at Science Hall 2 then University Hall then Social and Behavioral Sciences Building. So I\u2019m pretty back and forth. I can\u2019t get a clear idea of the distance between these classes and the time it would take to get between them based on the map. I was wondering if anyone could tell me how long it usually takes for them to get between these places since they look slightly far apart on the map but it could be deceiving? Is 15 minutes enough time to go back and forth? I know I\u2019ll eventually find out but I wanted to see if I could get prepared with other people\u2019s takes! Thank you!",

Most semesters I had at least one pair of classes with similar (or slightly longer; Science Hall 2 &lt;-&gt; Markstein is slightly longer than SBSB &lt;-&gt; University) distances and I had enough time to pick up a cup of coffee or go to the bathroom between them. It's a fairly small campus.",

            "comment": "Hi and welcome to CSUSM! :-) If you are able to drive to campus on a random weekday over the summer, I suggest timing it out yourself. I believe the buildings will be open during the summer semester. That way you can see what it's like to just walk normally vs the need to speed walk. Keep in mind that CSUSM has a ton (a ton!!) of stairs and the start of fall will be pretty warm.\n\nTo answer your question, yes it's doable. However, you may arrive to class a little sweaty is all. If you're cool with that, you're golden! I did a test run with my class schedule last month and I noticed I had a few minutes to spare but I was sweaty which I hated. I moved my classes around!",

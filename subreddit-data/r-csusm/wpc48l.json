    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am going to be a senior this year and I am looking for a place to live close to campus with absolutely no luck. I\u2019ve had 3 roommate/housing arrangements fall through and at this point I\u2019m pretty frustrated. Not to mention housing prices are absolutely ridiculous. I\u2019m looking at having to live on campus again which I REALLY don\u2019t want to do because of a shitty roommate experience last year. If anyone has an open room or knows someone that does please dm me. **Female roommates only! I would strongly prefer my own room and bathroom. Thank you!",

Ultimately I ended up applying for a studio dorm, and that worked out better with some unexpected life circumstances that came into play anyway. \n\nIf you're looking to live without a roommate, I'd apply for a studio dorm at the UVA. It comes out to about the same monthly as what most off-campus housing is for your own room and bathroom anyway. \n\nEither way, I wish you luck!",

Luckily this morning I applied for a 1 bedroom in escondido and I\u2019m pretty sure I got it. But yeah, housing is shit right now. Glad you were able to find something!",

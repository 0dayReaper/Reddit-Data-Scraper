    "postText": "Hi Reddit! I\u2019ve posted before about getting into Genetic Counseling, but I have another question!\n\nI\u2019m finding that I\u2019d like to go back and get another undergrad in Cell and Molecular Biology, possibly minoring in Psychology. This will help me with upper division courses required for my Masters- I\u2019d like to go to UCLA.\n\nProblem: I contacted UCSD and they said they don\u2019t accept students seeking a second bachelors. I contacted Cal State San Marcos and awaiting a response. But I\u2019m seeing a lot of these schools do not accept students who want a second bachelors.\n\nSo my question- where can I do a second one? If not how do I take upper division courses when I can\u2019t take the same level at my community college? Am I better off doing like a grad level certificate program of some kind to fulfill the graduate requirements if that\u2019s even possible?\n\nThanks!",

My ex-boyfriend got his Bachelor's in Philosophy but wanted to go back to get one in Computer Science since he already knew everything there was to know about computers and programming. SDSU told him he couldn't get a second degree. The fact that UCSD doesn't do it either doesn't surprise me.\n\nIt sounds like they want to save openings in their majors for people who don't have any degrees yet. I assume it has something to do with overcrowding in Californian colleges because I'm pretty sure you could go back and get a second degree as late as the '90s.\n\nI wish I knew how to advise you. Maybe an out-of-state college would take you, like University of Phoenix or something. My ex's experiences trying to get that second degree were all fruitless since no colleges in the area would take him.\n\nAnyway, good luck! If I'm wrong, someone please correct me.",

It is a program that provides biology, chemistry, physics, and math courses for students who already have a bachelor\u2019s but are hoping to switch to a medical career/degree program. Not exactly what you were asking for, but it may provide you the courses you need for your master\u2019s program.",

Post-bac programs are already few and far in between and highly competitive. Applying for these programs when medical/dental/vet/PA school is not your ultimate goal is not ok. We are also running into the same issues trying to get into classes. Going this route is not cool.",

So that could be an option for you.\n\nI also asked Azusa Pacific University, which is located in California, and they said they do allow second degrees. Their majors include biochemistry. I also asked Cal Baptist, and they allow a person to pursue a second degree as well; they have a major in biochemistry and molecular biology. However I don't know if these two schools require you to be a Christian before applying (I was looking at Cal Baptist's application process and it doesn't look like they ask for a statement of faith, so maybe no).",

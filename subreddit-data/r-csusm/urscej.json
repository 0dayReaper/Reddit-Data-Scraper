Me and my current roommate janell are looking for a third girl to room with us around late July early August. It is a single room, shared bathroom around $825 a month including utilities and water. it\u2019s located in the Vista/Oceanside area, it\u2019s a 15 minute drive to campus and a 15 minute drive to the beach. I am currently 4th year student at CSUSM majoring in Psychology and Janell is a 3rd year student majoring in Criminal Justice. We are both very laid back chill people. you can message us on here or me private on here or through instagram @ yseniamh",

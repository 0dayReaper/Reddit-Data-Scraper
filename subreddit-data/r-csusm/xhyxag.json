    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m possibly moving to the Carlsbad area for a Co-op position with a nearby company. Was wondering if there is any resources to look for a roommate or subleasing. I\u2019m not a student at CSUSM, I\u2019m currently going to Virginia Tech but I am from California. If there\u2019s anything I can look at it\u2019ll be great as I have a strict budget that is given from the company for housing stipend. Thank you!\n\nForgot to add but it\u2019ll be for the spring/summer semester next year!",

But only going north, never any problem coming back. I just skip the 78 now, take the next exit and take backroads to campus. It's a little longer distance but I'm saving like 10 mins.",

But it\u2019s really just those morning/evening rush hours that suck and it\u2019s usually fine for the rest of the day. Also, Mira Mesa is a lovely area with lots of amazing food. :)",

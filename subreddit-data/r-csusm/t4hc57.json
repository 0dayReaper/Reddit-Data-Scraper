All the other people I know who tried to appeal their first ticket got denied too. ): Just FYI for people who were optimistic about that like I was.",

I have been doing this since for 8 weeks now and nobody has said anything about it. As long as no parking officer/employee sees you with a backpack you should be good to go.\n\nOnly catch is that it is a 90 minute parking spot (until 6pm) so make sure you move your car ASAP once your class ends. But man is that free parking worth a ten minute walk to campus!",

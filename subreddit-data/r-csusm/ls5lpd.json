    "postText": "If I were to explore the campus at night time, is that ok?\n\nEdit: thanks for the comments guys. \n\nI purposely left out a bit of information that ill include now. I didn't want anyone's opinion to be influenced by my experience.  \n\n I was working out on campus last night (doing push ups, pull ups, etc) when campus police detained me, and said they would arrest me if I did not ID myself.\n\nThey said I was not welcome on campus because campus was closed.  And they told me to beat it.\n\nThey said that apparently one of the employees felt threatened or something because of my presence (I never interacted with anyone before the police arrived). Maybe it was because I was wearing a hood because it was cold and someone got scared of a \"hooded man\"?\n\nI'm fine with the police investigating the situation,  but its not cool if they lied to me (or were misinformed) about my ability to be on public property ( I'm also a student btw).\n\nI'm following up on this. Campus police dispatch said the campus is open to the public and that they don't know why the police officers would tell me to leave. I will update this with what the sergeant says.\n\nFinal Edit: The sergeant told me it was cool to be on the campus. The buildings are closed but as long as you don't disturb people then its cool.  The police that told me to leave were either misinformed about the situation or told some lies \ud83e\udd25",

I even used one of the restrooms that just so happened to be open. Anyways, long story short. I went on campus at night with friends and nothing happened. No security. No police. \n\nAt my undergraduate university, the campus was open. I would scooter around with some buds there as well. Go to vending machines (we lived on campus) at 3 am.\n\nI say try it and if nothing happens you good lol.",

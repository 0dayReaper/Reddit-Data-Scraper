    "postText": "Hey guys, I was wondering if there are late applications for transfer students at CSUSM? I know Chico is doing them, all I had to do was basically explain why my application is late and then they either accept or reject the reason (they accepted it), and they gave me an invite code when I then put into the Cal State Apply portal. Has anybody ever heard of San Marcos doing this? Thank you.",

    "postText": "* There are a whole bunch of events happening the first two weeks to introduce you to the school. [Weeks of Welcome](http://www.csusm.edu/sll/onsp/WOW2013.html) (wow such acronym). \n\n* Yes. There are stairs. Lots of them. If you're able-bodied, just get used to climbing them. It'll be handy for _that one 8 AM class you have and you always wake up late for and you're rushing to get to class and this goddamn elevator takes forever to go down all 4 floors and oh fuck it I'm just going to run up the stairs ... oh jesus that was a bad idea now I'm out of breath and everyone is looking at me this is embarrassing how am I so out of shape_.  \n\n* Our school is incredibly safe. Universities are required to release data regarding crimes at the school, under a thing called the Clery Act. [Here's our school's latest report](http://www.csusm.edu/police/Clery.pdf), data doesn't start till page 31. To contrast, here's [UCSD's](http://police.ucsd.edu/docs/AnnualClery.pdf) (starts on the very last page). \n\n* Your tuition pays for a membership to the gym on campus. You may as well check it out. [The Clarke](http://www.csusm.edu/theclarke/index.html).  \n* There are also [Fitness Classes](http://www.csusm.edu/rec/fitnessclasses.html) that will start a few weeks into the semester. Free for students. Yoga, Taekwondo, Indoor cycling for some examples.  \n* There are also some one-day (or one-weekend) events that are cheap, but not free, available to students. [Excursions](http://www.csusm.edu/rec/excursions.html)  \n\n* Your tuition also pays for some [Medical Services](http://www.csusm.edu/shcs/medicalservices/index.html). Basic general health, sexual health, mental health.  \n\n* [Cougar Apps](http://www.csusm.edu/iits/support/cougarapps/) - a way to access (1) some programs for free that you may not normally have, (2) your files from your school account on any computer.  \n\n* [Here is a handy map](http://www.csusm.edu/parking/images/map.pdf). It has all of the buildings and parking lots labeled (Note it does not have the 2 under-construction buildings drawn out. Dealwithit.gif).  \n\n* [Here is a calendar](http://www.csusm.edu/par/acdsched/scheduling%20files/acal_2013-14.pdf) of important dates. Spend 5 minutes and put them into your google calendar.  While we're at it, [you can find out right now what time your final exams are at](http://www.csusm.edu/par/acdsched/final_exam_schedules.html).\n\n* The library is a great place to go to study. Or browse Reddit. Or nap. 5th floor has a \"Quiet room\", it's quiet. There are also a lot of chairs around the floor in which you can relax/sleep.  \n\n* There are rooms in both the library and Markstein Hall which you can reserve for your group to work in, undisturbed. You should book a room so that you have a rightful claim to it [here](http://biblio.csusm.edu/site/reserve-group-study-rooms).  \n\n* There are [student clubs](http://www.csusm.edu/orgs/), apparently. Within the first few weeks, you should see them advertising themselves. Check them out. If you miss out on those events, try contacting the email from that link for whatever club interests you.  \n\n* There is free language tutoring at the [Language Learning Center](http://www.csusm.edu/llc/), free STEM tutoring at the [STEM Center](http://www.csusm.edu/stem/stemcenter.html), free writing tutoring at the [Writing Center](http://www.csusm.edu/writingcenter/), [Accounting Lab](http://www.csusm.edu/accounting/accountinglab.html) for accounting help, ...Basically, there's tutoring for any subject out there. Just look/ask for it.  \n\n* [LGBTQ Pride Center](http://www.csusm.edu/pridecenter/). \n\n* [Arts and Lectures](http://www.csusm.edu/al/calendar.html). If you like art or culture, there are some events you may be interested in.  \n* [Frontiers in Science](http://www.csusm.edu/physics/events1/frontiersinscience.html). If you like science, there are some events you may be interested in.  \n\n* If you see \"Work for students, $18/hour base pay\" etc. written on whiteboards or in chalk on the ground, or people passing out Vector Marketing business cards... Ignore it/them. It is all basically a pyramid scheme, just look at the [Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Marketing)  \n\n* Our school seems to have a separate facebook profile for every single building or entity, for better or for worse. [Here is a list](https://www.facebook.com/browse/fanned_pages/?id=113677648662467) of the different things the main FB account likes, many of which are other CSUSM pages. Like the ones relevant to you to your heart's content.  ",

You shouldn't have a problem with finding a spot at any parking lot on campus at 8AM. Any time later, yes, it will be crowded and hard to find parking. So I recommend making lot B as your priority for the first few weeks as long as you don't mind the extra 5 min walk. Little tip -- if you ever park in the Markstein lot, just park in the back instead of wasting 10-15 minutes looking for a decent spot. ",

You'll be tired and just want to go home -- not wander all the way across the campus (which is rather large).  \n\nthe Parking Structure is a huge pain for the first month or so. With really just 1 exit and so many cars in a densely-packed space, the traffic is hell and you likely won't find any parking spots on the first 3 floors (although maybe with an 8:30 class you will have luck, that's fairly early). But, if you have classes in SBSB, Sci-2 or Arts buildings, you may just want to put up with it.",

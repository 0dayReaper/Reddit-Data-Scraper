Worst case, add 4-5 inches to the length and width of the mattress. \nHeight is adjustable, my roommate fit a 4x4 cubby shelf under hers at max height.",

You would have to store the provided one somewhere in the apartment which would be a pain as existing furniture cannot be removed.\n\nAlso, getting that mattress into your room would be a nightmare and 1/2. I really would suggest against it.\n\nI purchased a 3 inch mattress topper and it got me through my two years in housing!",

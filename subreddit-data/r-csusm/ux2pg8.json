            "comment": "Actually behavioral economics (aka behavioral psychology but in regards to economic behavior) is becoming VERY in-demand. Just search for \"Dan Ariely\" and \"Rory Sutherland\" on youtube (like their TED and TEDx stuff will get you started so you get more recommendations). Economics isn't economics without psychology, and psychology is engrained in business success and failure.\n\nEDIT: ofc check with advisors and such, but behavioral psychology is a nice thing to go into for your main study field, especially if you go into ANY business minor subject. Any advisor who disagrees believe we are perfectly rational human beings who make decisions regardless of conditions because we have perfect trust and information. And Dan Ariely shows you in a TED talk that is just not the case. So he/she is wrong.\n\nEDIT2: And like Rory Sutherland says, being an expert in one thing is VERY difficult, you'll have SO much competition, but if you have two subject areas of expertise, especially if one of them is more obscure (relative to job market) and still relevant then you're very much more able to compete.",

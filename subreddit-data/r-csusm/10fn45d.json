I flunked out my second semester and had to go to Palomar for the first semester of my second year. I got all A\u2019s and B\u2019s that semester, reinstated to csusm, and still graduated.\n\n\nUse this as a learning experience to get your shit together and stop wasting your parents\u2019 money, or at least that\u2019s what I did.\n\n&gt; can u appeal academic disqualification?\n\n\nYes, but no",

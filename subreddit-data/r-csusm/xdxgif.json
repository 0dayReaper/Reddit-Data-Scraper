    "postText": "Hi, I'm a student at another CSU who's currently attempting to withdraw there because the location just isn't working out. Since I got admitted to another CSU via transfering from both palomar and MSJC, should I just apply via calstateapply without meeting a counselor? It would take way too long to schedule a meeting with one, and I'm not sure if there's any specific classes or requirements that CSUSM requires.",

You've already been admitted to another CSU as a transfer student so it seems like you already have all of the requirements needed to transfer to CSUSM. I would just go straight to Cal State Apply and go for it. I believe you have until the end of September to apply for Spring term so you have a bit of time! :-)",

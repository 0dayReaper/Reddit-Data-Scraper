In this email should have instructions if you want/need to change orientation times.\n\nNote: you must attend orientation, if not you cant register for classes. This especially sucks for transfers, since you guys register last or next to last",

I contacted the school cuz I have work and other things that day but they said the other days are for different majors than mine so they didn\u2019t recommend I change it. Don\u2019t know if that really makes a big difference or not but I took their word for it. \nIt\u2019s stupid how we are forced to go to something that isn\u2019t exactly cheap to go to, and that is a pretty big inconvenience and have it only be one set day during the week. Anything to get any $$ they can squeeze out of us tho ig.",

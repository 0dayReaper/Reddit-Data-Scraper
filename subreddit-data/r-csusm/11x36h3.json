I used to study there sometimes and you can get free tutoring and help with almost any subject. Only downside is it's a bit of a walk.\n\nEdit: Oh and I got to school early a few times (like 5Am) and the first floor of the library was open. You may want to check if the first floor is still open after 5 PM.",

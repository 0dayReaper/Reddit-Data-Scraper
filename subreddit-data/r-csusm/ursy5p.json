I will be using Fahrenheit because that\u2019s what I\u2019m accustomed to. \n\nSan Marcos is in Southern California, it takes half an hour to an hour to get to San Diego, and 2-3 hours to get to LA. \n\nDuring the spring semester which is January - May you\u2019ll experience a wide variety of weather. In the winter months it ranges from chilly days in the 50s to nights in the low 30s it rains the most during this time. Not too much rain but a bit. In the spring months it\u2019ll become warmer and depending how much rain there was the plants may turn green, also orange flowers (poppy flowers). In the end towards the last month it\u2019ll start to become very hot, it reaches the 90s - 100s during the day and may remain as high as 80 depending on humidity. \n\nThe advantages of a spring here is experiencing the transition of the weather. It can be gray some days, but for the most part it\u2019s a beautiful blue sky during the day and cloudy/foggy at night with the marine layer (clouds and fog from the ocean). \n\nThe fall semester is from late August - December. Here is where things get fun \ud83d\ude09 as you may know California is a big wild fire state, you will be safe don\u2019t worry haha but things north of us in Orange/Riverside/LA county will get fires. San Marcos has a big mountain it\u2019s built on that does catch on fire every 10 years or so. The school doesn\u2019t burn but it\u2019s hot so everyone evacuates. LETS ASSUME NO FIRES AT THE SCHOOL, which is very safe to assume because our fire dept has gotten very good at handling them. Then you can expect hot months ahead of you, ranging from the 90s -100s during the day on hot days or nice 80s for the most part with nice wind :) it feels great to be out here and definitely expect a tan. In the last couple of months it\u2019ll start to get cooler, maybe the 60s - 50s. But I\u2019ve been in 90-100 degree Decembers so be prepared haha. \n\nOverall it\u2019s described as a Mediterranean climate with great sun, wind, and a nice driving distance from everything. It has a small town vibe so expect to go to other schools/towns for parties or nightlife. The beach is just 20 minutes away and the people here are nice. 70% of the school commute to school so it\u2019s hard to have anyone trying to hang out at dorms but like others say, if you look for it you can find it. \n\nI hope you find any of the info helpful and hope you have a fun experience here :)",

I lived in the Bay Area for about 6 years before moving to San Diego a year ago and the weather here is so much nicer than the Bay.\n\n  \nSan Marcos does get windy, but that's really nice during the summer/spring! I think it can get up to 40 degrees celsius during very hot days, and maybe in the low teens during the coldest. The nice thing is there is very little humidity (at least compared to what I'm used to in Ontario Canada) so the heat is dryer. Make sure you stay hydrated in California. :-) \n\nHope that helps.",

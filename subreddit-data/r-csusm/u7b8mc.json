UVA is older and the hallways reminded me of something out of a prison movie. Great if you like a quieter living situation, but less sunlight and made me feel boxed in and isolated (first floor). You get to avoid that awful hill if you stay the UVA though, lol.",

If the Quad is full or if you\u2019re priced out I would still recommend UVA because on-campus living is a really fantastic experience IMO. I graduated a long time ago and I\u2019m still close friends with my #quadsquad.",

UVA doesn\u2019t come with a tv but instead is more for students who are more focused with school. The newest dorms I wouldn\u2019t suggest as you require a meal plan with the only meal cafe in the Quad.",

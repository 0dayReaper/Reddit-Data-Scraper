            "comment": "I graduated with that degree. Pretty good experience, you get a good mix of technology and business curriculum. One downside is that it doesn\u2019t go too deeply into one thing. So if you have an idea of what kind of job you\u2019d like to do after graduating, I would recommend pursuing a relevant IT certification. Job outlook is pretty good since it is a broad enough degree, it\u2019s relevant to many tech jobs. I had a job one month after graduating.",

Like /u/JumboJackTwoTacos said, it\u2019s not too in depth. Having certifications would be the way to go, I\u2019m personally going to do that after I graduate (taking Spring, Summer, &amp; Fall classes). I\u2019m deciding between cybersecurity, Project Manager, and IT at the moment. \n\nSidenote: (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) but I believe we\u2019re one of the smaller departments in CoBA\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask!",

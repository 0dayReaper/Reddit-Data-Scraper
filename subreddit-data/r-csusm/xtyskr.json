            "comment": "CSUSM is rather lax in who they accept. They're not an ivy league school looking for excuses to toss out an application. As long as you meet their minimum requirements for transferring, you're essentially accepted.\n\nFor example, I had a 0.8 GPA at on point at Palomar community college because I was ready and grieving over the death of a close friend. I was able to renew maybe half of the terms I took. While I was still able to retake a few of the classes, there were a few classes that just weren't available anymore 5 years later. Thus resulting in marks I just couldn't get rid of. I transferred just fine and no one really cared about some class I failed 7 years ago.\n\nPost graduation, your marks are sort of irrelevant as well. No one questions how well you did at school, they just need to know you have a degree to prove you did the work. Then it comes down to your ability to market your experience, work ethics, and general likability as a person over your other degree holding peers.",

Now I am standing at 2.98 and by next semester I should be hopefully getting a 3.0 overall gpa. Do you think i would be able to get in with the transfer? I\u2019m going to apply soon",

I actually think the acceptance rate has gone up in recent years since the pandemic trimmed down the amount of applicants. If you're local to socal, you're likely to be prioritized. Good luck to you.",

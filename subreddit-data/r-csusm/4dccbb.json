It's like they ran out of shit to talk about. \n\nIt's harmful though, because people who are close minded to begin with are going to look at shit like this and just write the whole gender equality/ feminist movement off when they might have given it a chance otherwise. Makes the whole thing look like a joke. \n\n",

In my world, straight means someone who wants to only be sexual or in romantic relationship with the opposite sex.\n\nI just don't understand how 'homosexual contact in heterosexual ways' makes any sense. Or how having sex with men allows straight men to authenticate their masculinity and whiteness. To me that sounds like 'the most manliest thing I can do as a man, is another man', which makes no sense.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what is discussed nonetheless. ",

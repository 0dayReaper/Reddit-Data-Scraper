I am joining during fall semester 2021 doing electrical engineering and got admitted with a 3.0 GPA with pretty standard grades in high school. To be honest I was ready to be rejected but I actually made it surprisingly. Other students like me should hold on to hope because I am sure you will be accepted! Can't wait to experience stair hell with everyone else lmao",

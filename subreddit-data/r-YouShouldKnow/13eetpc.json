    "postText": "Why YSK: Assuming you\u2019re good at what you do, if you\u2019re happily trundling along at your job, you won\u2019t get as many promotion opportunities and likely have smaller raises.\n\nAll things equal, companies give preference to what will pain them in the present, like a good employee leaving. Companies do flight risk analyses of their staff to make sure they are proactive and do not lose good people.  For sure, folks who are a flight risk get bigger raises and more opportunities.\n\nNow this doesn\u2019t mean that you threaten to leave or whine about pay. Instead, talk with your manager about your career ambitions and talk about other careers with a twinkle in your eye.\n\nWhat\u2019s that look like?  Here you go:  So I\u2019ve been thinking about my career goals now that I have my feet under me, I\u2019d like to get to X, what do you think the path looks like?  Blah blah answer. Interesting, I\u2019m targeting about a year from now for that move, does that seem reasonable?  blah blah probably hedging answer.   Oh okay, what do you think we\u2019d have to do together in our group (or organization) to make that happen by next year?  Answer that could be non-sense, maybe you have a good manager.  Got it, okay, well my close friend has seen a lot of value having a mentor at their company. Who would you suggest that is outside our (function, group etc) that I could get linked up with to help me build relationships within the org and grown my career?\n\nAs a leader, if someone had that conversation with me, damn sure I\u2019d be thinking about what I can give them (work, experience, and  $) to keep them and help them grow. \n\nSalary discussion: have the conversation 5-6 months before annual merit raises happen.  Sit down and have a 1:1 with your boss.  Talk about things other than $ especially if you\u2019re performing well.  Get some kudos, talk about how you\u2019re enjoying the role and how you want to grow your career. Ask how your boss grew their career. As you get near the end, say, \u201cone other thing that\u2019s been on my mind\u2026 my close friend at a similar company and I were talking about salaries and I was surprised. I talked to a few more friends to do some market research and feels like there\u2019s a gap of about (pick something a little higher than reasonable) between my salary and market rate.  I just wanted you to know what I\u2019m seeing on my end over here as I\u2019m keen to keep working on X and grow my career because Y.\n\nIf for some reason your boss is an idiot and asks you who, or how much, just say something like. I polled a handful of people across areas and firms. If they push: I\u2019ve got it on a spreadsheet at home\u2026 do you think you can get a file with all of our companies employees, salaries and titles so we can review it all at once (say this with a dead straight face).  That will end it.\n\nNote that should be obvious: it\u2019s best if some of this is true or  \u201ctruth adjacent\u201d",

This is in an economic depression and at a firm that is feeling its effects. Also, along the lines of OP\u2019s advice, asking \u201chow do I get from senior associate to salaried partner?\u201d got me promoted to head of department without me ever having to ask for a promotion.  \n\nOP\u2019s approach won\u2019t work generally. You have to be worth the effort of keeping happy. Yes, it\u2019s important to plant the seeds. How you plant the seed though - I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go down OP\u2019s suggested route, especially with the salary suggestion. I can explain what I did - but it\u2019s going to be different for everyone. \n\nI would also caution anyone against appearing as a \u201cflight risk\u201d without further thought. Depending on your profession and the value your employer perceives you bring, the plan could backfire horribly and leave your employer unwilling to invest all that much further in you.",

What you are creating is a sense with your manager that you are driving your career and salary growth is on your mind.\n\nThe data isn\u2019t that important, the narrative is. The spreadsheet comment is a parry in case your boss digs in and wants details. The company has tons of data from within the company and likely external company salary data that they pay for that they one hundred percent will not share with you to help you make your salary decisions. The point of the spreadsheet is that you\u2019ve also gather data and you\u2019re not really going to share it because they\u2019re not sharing their data with you. You both are just going on the information that you have.\n\nThe goal of that conversation is not to have a hard numbers discussion on why you deserve X dollars, it\u2019s to open a dialog that you have your eye on the market. You\u2019re in the business of managing your career.  You\u2019re not aimless, you\u2019re managing your salary with the same effort as they manage their P&amp;L.",

While I think your point on the bluff stands, your point on pay being overly structured is very dependent on the company, field and the person's actual salary.  I am not sure why OP made it sound like you should bluff here, it shouldn't be that hard to go out and find some information on what other people are making in your field.  There are a number of sites that have that information and there are far more people willing to talk about their pay and compensation now than in the past.  \n\nMy own experience and of those I have mentored by and those I have mentored in my own field, have been greatly affected by some of these strategies.  Personally my career took a massive upswing when I started to stick up for myself, did market research, was more forward in salary and growth discussions, etc.  I have seen the same in others as well.  By nature, *most* companies are going to want to keep your salary as low as possible to help with their bottom line.  Unless you really advocate for yourself, they are going to give you small increases.  \n\nThis is where I really disagree with your statement that there is no flexibility and your salary/increase is always just a preset number.  Given that companies want to save as much as possible, it is also very likely if you *haven*'*t* already been using these tactics, you are likely on the low to mid end of your position, meaning there is absolutely room for increase.  Even if you are on the high end, if you can show how much impact you have with the company and how much more another company may be willing to pay, it can have a positive impact.  The key is showing what else is out there as a *comparison* and **not** a *threat*.  Depending on the field and company, getting a competing offer may help once, but the company may also label you a flight risk and may not be as willing to keep doing that.  However, if you just keep showing comparables, while expressing your accomplishments and how much you enjoy working for the company (assuming you do enjoy it), you can and will influence your pay far more effectively, certainly over those who just assume they get what they get.  \n\nThe worst thing you can do is just assume the company cannot pay you anymore and everything is just always slotted.  That is a absolute disaster to your career.",

So they give me more responsibility and that leads to raises, etc. I\u2019m sure they know by now I\u2019d leave of there were no opportunities, but my direct manager and even the director don\u2019t have as much say as people think over adding new staff or new positions.

It is sold to work on a broad scale when in reality this would only work in select scenarios and even then wouldn\u2019t always work. So if there\u2019s anything \u201cyou should know\u201d it\u2019s to NOT take this advice to the bank. More so use it as an example of how you should strategize how to go about working towards increasing the likelihood of bagging more money and/or a higher position at your current job. Professional experience ultimately equates to understanding build-up to negotiation leverage and how to use it once you reach a period where the discussion would be deemed acceptable. That doesn\u2019t mean that the conversation can\u2019t just simply be something as privately saying, \u201cHey, when you\u2019re available can we discuss my future here at (x-company/business)?\u201d\nThen after you\u2019ve secured a meeting time for said discussion; simply professionally communicating to your boss that you feel like your pay isn\u2019t adequate for x,y z reasons along with examples to back up your reasons is very often all it takes. During the conversation gauge feedback and if you feel you\u2019ve been well received secure a timeline &amp; information on your newfound strategic environment. By then you should have a clear understanding on if more money/promotions are possible for you and if it\u2019s within a timeline that works for you. Bluffing is normally only ok if you\u2019re willing to follow through. \nEx: \u201cbluff\u201d as in you don\u2019t want to leave but if you don\u2019t get what you\u2019re looking for; be prepared to put in a 2 weeks notice and actually leave. \n\nSometimes that last part is enough added pressure to secure what you\u2019re looking for.",

If your coworker is keeping note of their accomplishments, their worth comparative to the market and generally talking themselves up and all you are doing is keeping your head down and doing work, then yes, your coworker is far more likely to get a raise.  This happens all the time.  What incentive does the company have to give you a raise or promote you if you seem completely content and happy with things as they are?  They generally are only motivated enough as it concerns keeping you around.  \n\nThis also mainly applies to medium to larger companies.  Smaller companies it is usually easier to see who is a good employee and who isn't.  Larger companies it can become more obfuscated and hampered by red tape, making even more important on keeping good and open communication with your boss on your merits and salary.  *Especially* if you are a good/hard worker.  Working hard and doing exceptional work is not going to magically give you the raise/promotion that you deserve.  Keeping notes, showing your desire for growth/opportunities, keeping up with market equivalents, and sharing with your boss will.",

I've been using this with my current employer for over ten years with promotions and/or notable merit increases almost every year.

Just talk numbers with me and lets actually accomplish something- i dont care if you move more, if nothing quantifiable actually comes of it. I dont need to invest in that waste. I sure as hell dont need you applying it elsewhere. Your drive and charisma means nothing if you dont have the numbers to show for it- thats all I need! \n\nI dont give a fuck how your eyes twinkle, i dont give a fuck how pretty you are, i dont give a fuck if youre autistic, i dont give a fuck if you smell (unless customers give a fuck if you smell- then its become my problem, but not by default), i dont give a fuck if you reinvent the whole system and make a lower managers head explode.\n\nIf you not only have the numbers, but can articulate and communicate them- youre getting more from the company. Thats that. Thats what works. And im thanking you. \n\nIf you have a conversation with me and nothing is quantifiably accomplished- youre wasting my time and im holding it against you. I dont give a fuck about your tone, what you say your ambitions are, or how your eyes twinkle. Doesnt matter how long you\u2019ve worked with me- youre getting shit for that. If youre looking at leaving- dont waste more of my time. Ill do your job for a while, but let me start now or plan for it sooner rather than being surprised by it later. \n\nWere here for money. Not to \u201cbe a family\u201d or whatever the fuck. Let\u2019s talk numbers not feelings. Im not your mother. I want you here for money. You want to be here for money. This isnt your life- I want your life to be outside and at home and with your family. This is your money. We do money. Dont bring your feelings up in here. If you need a day to deal with something I always give it- because i dont want that in the workplace, it cuts into our money. We talk money and leave that shit at home. If money is how you take care of those things to not bring to the workplace and burden others with- quantify that, and give it to me, and thats how you will get more money. Because that makes sense. Thats how this will work for everyone. \n\nThis isnt your boomer dads company. Boomers are dying/retiring and the world they came from doesnt exist anymore. They\u2019re on their way out- dont prepare to see more of them. Thats not a good investment. We\u2019re all here for money. Stop with this emotional manipulation bs.",

One of my best General Managers was bipolar. No way in hell im making any judgement on \u201chow he feels\u201d or \u201chow he presents to me\u201d at the time, when literally all the numbers in every way, are in his favor. That would be really stupid of me. That would be doing my job poorly. That would lose me money- and why am I even here? Feelings and the way they present themselves at the time shouldn\u2019t determine Jack shit against what actually happens with the numbers. Saying how he feels is important- is dismissing the reality of what he actually accomplishes despite his shifts of feelings- which is pretty dumb on my part if I want to keep the business profitable through his work. It applies to everyone. Numbers: Thats what I always promoted and gave raises based on- thats why I was good at my job and never promoted people that ended up being a detriment to the company. Because i dont do emotional manipulation nonsense. Anyone can act, and use feelings to tug at someone else\u2019s emotions, whether they\u2019re actually truthful or good at what they do, or not. \n\nYou understand how many people get by in life by being very very good at presenting themselves? Why would you just reward that? That means nothing. That gives YOU nothing- so why give them something for it? If, by the end of the conversation, nothing is quantifiably improved, inform them of that, and thats it. Make a note that they\u2019ve wasted your time before, trying to squeeze money out of you- its good to keep track of those very charismatic types. Its a tell tale sign of narcissism and sociopathy. They tend to do very well in business because of it- just not mine. I know that game.",

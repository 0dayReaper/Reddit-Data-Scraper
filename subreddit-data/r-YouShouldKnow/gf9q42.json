These will provide a much higher quality cut of leather that will look and feel much better and last for much longer.",

            "comment": "**Genuine is not a kind/type/grade of leather this the biggest myth in my industry**\n\nI work for a leather goods company that my dad started in 1969 and we've spent millions on leather over the years from some of the best tanneries in the world.\n\nYes genuine can certainly refer to a bad/cheap kind of leather called a finished split, which is basically cheap suede with a coating to make it look smooth but were you to call up a tannery, you'd couldn't ask to buy \"genuine leather\" and expect them to know what you wanted.\n\nTechnically speaking full grain is a kind of top grain and all leather is genuine...it\u2019s just that in the case of lower quality companies, they\u2019ll use the term with the highest perceived value they can get away with. There are exceptions: I can name some great products stamped \u201cgenuine leather\u201d and some junk products labeled \u201cfull grain.\u201d Red Wing Heritage is a good example of a great company who uses the word \"genuinely.\" I own several pairs of their boots that have \u201cgenuine leather\u201d stamped in the sole (neither the leather used in the uppers or the sole is low quality).\n\n By it's legal definition (at least in the USA), \"Genuine\" is not nor has it ever been a specific \"class/kind/type/grade\" of low quality leather.\n\n The breakdown you tend see around the net ( Full Grain &gt; Top Grain &gt; Genuine/Split &gt; Bonded ) **isn\u2019t an official grading scale (no government or leather trade group uses it),**just a general guide could use you when you can\u2019t find more out about the leather or the brand.\n\n[In spite of what people say, bonded leather can not be called genuine legally in the USA (without qualifiers like bonded, reconstituted, etc).](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=da0fff93d248d84476b245ccfa2ce5bc&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=16%3A1.0.1.2.14&amp;idno=16)\n\nThis (above) is the only legal regulation about leather labeling you'll find in the USA.\n\nHere's a post where a spokesperson from Horween, the most famous tannery in the USA, explains the actual meaning of top grain. While he doesn't get into \"genuine\" just the fact that he says \"full grain is type of top grain\", is enough to debunk the grading scale:\n\n[https://stridewise.com/top-grain-vs-full-grain-vs-split-grain-leather/](https://stridewise.com/top-grain-vs-full-grain-vs-split-grain-leather/)\n\nAdditionally \"full grain\" isn't a guarantee you're getting good leather, it just means they haven't sanded the hide, but there's so much more that goes into making good leather than just that one step. The tanning solutions and finishes are like the \"secret sauce\" for some tanneries which is why full grain leather from Horween in Chicago will cost $10 per square foot whereas full grain from a tannery in Pakistan is under $2.\n\nHere\u2019s a little more accurate breakdown:\n\n* Leather (aka top grain) is the outside (the smooth part).\n* Suede has 2 fuzzy sides because it\u2019s split from the bottom of the top grain.\n\nFrom a tannery perspective, top grain includes all leather that\u2019s not a split from the underside of the leather. Within that category leather can be full grain (nothing done to the surface), corrected grain aka sanded, and embossed. Some leathers can be both sanded and embossed. Just sanded leather is know as nubuck. Sanded and then finished is known as corrected grain (usually). There are hundreds of variations on embossed patterns.\n\nYou can go further into finishes and other qualities: waxed, tea core, pull-up, pigmented, aniline, semi aniline. Plus loads more.\n\nLeather that retains its smooth side but that\u2019s used for the \u201csuede side\u201d is known as Roughout, full grain suede, or reverse.\n\nWith suede there are less variations and the variations don\u2019t have many specific names beyond individual tannage names used by specific tanneries. A main difference how fuzzy it is (how much nap). They can also wax suede and do some other cool stuff: Check out CF Stead\u2019s website to see some really unique suedes. It's also of note that Horween's retail site sells the suedes at a price comparable to their full grain leathers.\n\nThe only leather that can legally be called \u201cgenuine\u201d that I\u2019d say is always bad is a kind of suede is called a finished split. Finished splits (painted or pu coated) are bad because they are attempts to make fuzzy leathers look like smooth top grain; the \u201cfake\u201d outer layer doesn\u2019t last. You probably won\u2019t see this term on a product description, but it is the actual industry term for this type of leather.\n\nWith all of these except the finished split, no single of these grades types is really any \u201cbetter\u201d than others.Even then, there are ways to \"finish\" suede that are unique and don't \"try to pretend to be something they're not\" from companies like  [CF Stead](http://www.cfstead.com/products/).  Just look at how many variations there are in just one company's offerings for just for Suede (the lowest tier according to our aforementioned break down)...also just google \"CF Stead boots\" to get an the idea that \"suede\" is not a low grade when made by a quality company. \n\nIf they are from a good tannery, any type of leather and even suede will last almost the same regardless. Conversely something that people generally associate with quality like full grain, won't be as good as a non-full grain leather from a lesser tannery. Same goes for Veg tan vs Chrome tan, Horween deals in both and pricing is less that $1 difference per foot Essex vs Chromexcel.\n\nAs Nick Horween said in [this interview:](https://tenlessonslearned.wordpress.com/2018/09/01/ten-lessons-learned-nick-horween-of-horween-leather/) *\"There\u2019s a feeling in the market that vegetable tanned leather is better or more environmentally friendly than chrome tanned leather. They are just different and require different types of management through manufacturing. We do both and they each have their strengths and shortcomings.*\"\n\n**TLDR: There are high end tanneries that deal in all of these types (it's incorrect to call them grades) of leather and also \u201clow end tanneries\u201d that can do any of these \u201ctypes.\" You can actually spend as much on high quality suede as a full grain from a lesser tannery (same is true for Veg-tan vs Chrome tan). Which is why saying that these differences (grades) are a reliable way to judge quality is incorrect. Another reason is why it's incorrect is that none of the terms tell you the animal: A full grain lambskin is completely different in terms of durability when compared to any type of cowhide.**",

Compare it to other more \"premium\" ice creams by volume, like a half-gallon haagen dazs or ben and jerry's or whatever. They're significantly heavier. They're actually denser than breyer's.\n\n\nThere is an exception though, their base flavors, vanilla or chocolate, or anything without toppings, are all \"ice creams\". Anything with a topping though is immediately a \"frozen dairy dessert\". Really says a lot when the fact they add toppings to their air and sugar mixture, it's just enough to tip it over the edge to not qualify as ice cream anymore. \n\nNot even ben and jerry's has this issue, and their ice cream's toppings is a legit 1/3 of the entire solid mass of the volume. US marketing standards are pretty lenient, so the fact the base breyer's are fine totally fine but suddenly isn't with their stingy toppings, you know they're complete fucking dogshite.\n\nIt's beyond me why people continue to buy this unsatisfying garbage when it's barely a dollar cheaper/half gallon but much much worse than the 30% you're saving from not buying a  middle-of-the-pack brand like turkey hill or blue bunny.",

So your juice might be cut with a cheaper juice filler (looking at you, pear). It doesn't have to explain on the front that it isn't 100% of the label named fruit, just in the nutrition/ingredient panel.\n\n* 100% (fruit/veg name here) juice not from concentrate - now we're talking about it being what it says it is. Not from concentrate, single fruit. But it could have trace amounts of other ingredients; see nutrition/ingredient panel.\n\n* 100% juice from concentrate - the juice concentrate is an all juice concentrate that meets a minimum overall percentage of the total solution (see table on FDA link below for some of the ones they've given specific requirements about). That is all this means. The rest is water to replace the water removed from the original fruit source, etc etc.\n\nThen come the 'cocktail' 'juice drink' and similar things that mean... well, just always check the ingredient list.

But it has become somewhat codified at this point.\n\nThe reason why it only refers to the lowest quality leather is that it's the *only* thing that can be said about that kind of leather. Decent leathers can be described more specifically. You'll hear \"full grain\" and \"top grain\", but any products made for people who actually know about leather is going the list the region of origin, and often the manufacturer: \"Full grain italian leather\", or \"Horween Cavalier\".\n\nIt's sort of like if you buy a really expensive desk, it might be made of oak or maple. If you buy a cheap desk, it's probably made of \"real wood\". \n\nIt also get kind of complicated because the \"grades\" you so often hear about aren't actually grades so much as descriptions. Full grain, top grain, and split grain are methods of preparing the leather. Making a decent product out of full grain leather requires starting with decent leather, which is why it's usually highly regarded. But not all products are going to be practical if they're made from full thickness leather. So you will find some extremely high quality items made from high quality top grain leather, where flexibility or thinness was more important.",

                    "comment": "Not actually true though...\n\n**Genuine is not a kind/type/grade of leather this the biggest myth in my industry**\n\nI work for a leather goods company that my dad started in 1969 and we've spent millions on leather over the years from some of the best tanneries in the world.\n\nYes genuine can certainly refer to a bad/cheap kind of leather called a finished split, which is basically cheap suede with a coating to make it look smooth but were you to call up a tannery, you'd couldn't ask to buy \"genuine leather\" and expect them to know what you wanted.\n\nTechnically speaking full grain is a kind of top grain and all leather is genuine...it\u2019s just that in the case of lower quality companies, they\u2019ll use the term with the highest perceived value they can get away with. There are exceptions: I can name some great products stamped \u201cgenuine leather\u201d and some junk products labeled \u201cfull grain.\u201d Red Wing Heritage is a good example of a great company who uses the word \"genuinely.\" I own several pairs of their boots that have \u201cgenuine leather\u201d stamped in the sole (neither the leather used in the uppers or the sole is low quality).\n\nBy it's legal definition (at least in the USA), \"Genuine\" is not nor has it ever been a specific \"class/kind/type/grade\" of low quality leather.\n\nThe breakdown you tend see around the net ( Full Grain &gt; Top Grain &gt; Genuine/Split &gt; Bonded ) \\*\\*isn\u2019t an official grading scale (no government or leather trade group uses it),\\*\\*just a general guide could use you when you can\u2019t find more out about the leather or the brand.\n\n[In spite of what people say, bonded leather can not be called genuine legally in the USA (without qualifiers like bonded, reconstituted, etc).](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=da0fff93d248d84476b245ccfa2ce5bc&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=16%3A1.0.1.2.14&amp;idno=16)\n\nThis (above) is the only legal regulation about leather labeling you'll find in the USA.\n\nHere's a post where a spokesperson from Horween, the most famous tannery in the USA, explains the actual meaning of top grain. While he doesn't get into \"genuine\" just the fact that he says \"full grain is type of top grain\", is enough to debunk the grading scale:\n\n[https://stridewise.com/top-grain-vs-full-grain-vs-split-grain-leather/](https://stridewise.com/top-grain-vs-full-grain-vs-split-grain-leather/)\n\nAdditionally \"full grain\" isn't a guarantee you're getting good leather, it just means they haven't sanded the hide, but there's so much more that goes into making good leather than just that one step. The tanning solutions and finishes are like the \"secret sauce\" for some tanneries which is why full grain leather from Horween in Chicago will cost $10 per square foot whereas full grain from a tannery in Pakistan is under $2.\n\nHere\u2019s a little more accurate breakdown:\n\n* Leather (aka top grain) is the outside (the smooth part).\n* Suede has 2 fuzzy sides because it\u2019s split from the bottom of the top grain.\n\nFrom a tannery perspective, top grain includes all leather that\u2019s not a split from the underside of the leather. Within that category leather can be full grain (nothing done to the surface), corrected grain aka sanded, and embossed. Some leathers can be both sanded and embossed. Just sanded leather is know as nubuck. Sanded and then finished is known as corrected grain (usually). There are hundreds of variations on embossed patterns.\n\nYou can go further into finishes and other qualities: waxed, tea core, pull-up, pigmented, aniline, semi aniline. Plus loads more.\n\nLeather that retains its smooth side but that\u2019s used for the \u201csuede side\u201d is known as Roughout, full grain suede, or reverse.\n\nWith suede there are less variations and the variations don\u2019t have many specific names beyond individual tannage names used by specific tanneries. A main difference how fuzzy it is (how much nap). They can also wax suede and do some other cool stuff: Check out CF Stead\u2019s website to see some really unique suedes. It's also of note that Horween's retail site sells the suedes at a price comparable to their full grain leathers.\n\nThe only leather that can legally be called \u201cgenuine\u201d that I\u2019d say is always bad is a kind of suede is called a finished split. Finished splits (painted or pu coated) are bad because they are attempts to make fuzzy leathers look like smooth top grain; the \u201cfake\u201d outer layer doesn\u2019t last. You probably won\u2019t see this term on a product description, but it is the actual industry term for this type of leather.\n\nWith all of these except the finished split, no single of these grades types is really any \u201cbetter\u201d than others.Even then, there are ways to \"finish\" suede that are unique and don't \"try to pretend to be something they're not\" from companies like  [CF Stead](http://www.cfstead.com/products/). Just look at how many variations there are in just one company's offerings for just for Suede (the lowest tier according to our aforementioned break down)...also just google \"CF Stead boots\" to get an the idea that \"suede\" is not a low grade when made by a quality company.\n\nIf they are from a good tannery, any type of leather and even suede will last almost the same regardless. Conversely something that people generally associate with quality like full grain, won't be as good as a non-full grain leather from a lesser tannery. Same goes for Veg tan vs Chrome tan, Horween deals in both and pricing is less that $1 difference per foot Essex vs Chromexcel.\n\nAs Nick Horween said in [this interview:](https://tenlessonslearned.wordpress.com/2018/09/01/ten-lessons-learned-nick-horween-of-horween-leather/) *\"There\u2019s a feeling in the market that vegetable tanned leather is better or more environmentally friendly than chrome tanned leather. They are just different and require different types of management through manufacturing. We do both and they each have their strengths and shortcomings.*\"\n\n**TLDR: There are high end tanneries that deal in all of these types (it's incorrect to call them grades) of leather and also \u201clow end tanneries\u201d that can do any of these \u201ctypes.\" You can actually spend as much on high quality suede as a full grain from a lesser tannery (same is true for Veg-tan vs Chrome tan). Which is why saying that these differences (grades) are a reliable way to judge quality is incorrect. Another reason is why it's incorrect is that none of the terms tell you the animal: A full grain lambskin is completely different in terms of durability when compared to any type of cowhide.**",

They're dressing it up to make it sound exciting, but that's what the words mean --- \"this is leather, and not an imitation\".  It doesn't promise any more than that, and if they could, they likely would.",

Children ages 6-18 who have at least one parent with cancer (NED/\"in remission\", in current treatment, or who have deceased) can attend a week of summer camp for FREE. [Camp Kesem](https://www.kesem.org/) is run by local college volunteers, and provides kids an opportunity to connect, heal, and and have fun in a supportive environment.\n\nI was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year, and my kid will be attending her first Camp Kesem this summer. Her counselors have already mailed her letters, notes, and art activities to make her feel welcome and ready for camp.",

Every kid there is diabetic as are many of the counselors. The counselors are trained to do BG checks during the night. Every counselor carries a fanny pack with bg testing supplies, and stuff to treat lows. There is a volunteer med staff that work tirelessly to ensure food is properly carb counted and kids are dosed properly. Food provided is all generally low in sugar. Gives a kid with diabetes a chance to feel like they fit in and feel like a normal kid not having to worry about diabetes for a week. I can\u2019t recommend it enough.",

It's so important for children who are dealing with a parent's cancer diagnosis to have a safe and supportive space to connect with others who understand their experiences. I can only imagine how much your child is looking forward to attending Camp Kesem this summer, and it's wonderful to hear that the counselors are already making her feel welcome. Wishing you and your family all the best on your cancer journey.",

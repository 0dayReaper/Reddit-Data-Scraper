    "postText": "\\*\\*Why YSK:\\*\\* May is Stroke Awareness Month, so I thought I would re-share an important but underknown fact about strokes - that vision loss is one of the most common but underreported symptoms. The common expression for recognizing a stroke is FAST - Face, Arm, Speech, Time - which represents three common symptoms and that treating a stroke quickly is critical. However many in the stroke field (myself included) prefer BE FAST, which adds Balance and Eyes to the list of symptoms.\r  \n\r  \nNearly 56% of strokes result in a loss of vision, and up to 1% of the adult population suffers from vision loss due a stroke. This condition is known as Hemianopia and it cuts your vision in both eyes, on one side of the visual field. However, many people are not aware that strokes can affect your vision, and if your only symptom is vision loss many hospitals will not administer TPA, a drug critical to reversing stroke effects.\r  \n\r  \nThis DOES NOT MEAN that every change in vision is a stroke, or that every migraine aura is a reason to rush to the hospital, but it IS a symptom people should be aware of.\r  \n\r  \nSo, TL;DR - Strokes can affect vision, and you should be aware of the possible signs and symptoms to protect yourself and loved ones. Stay safe and take care!\r  \n\r  \nCitations:\r  \n[\"The lifetime risk of stroke has also increased over the last 20 years by 50% and is now one in four people\"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17474930211065917?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)\n\n[\"It is estimated that\r 60% of stroke survivors have visual impairment immediately after their\r stroke\"](https://www.stroke.org.uk/sites/default/files/final_report_unmet_need_2013.pdf)",

            "comment": "YSK - this is NOT AT ALL correct and a misinterpretation of the conclusions of what is a completely garbage non-peer reviewed paper. (I am an ER doctor and see acute strokes all the time, and only an extremely small fraction of them present with vision loss).\n\nThe author herself states in the discussion, \u201cWe were unable to identify a precise incidence rate for visual impairment post stroke. We reviewed a variety of articles, a few of which were randomised control trials but many which were retrospective or prospective observation studies. Robust methodologies could not be identified in many studies. We have therefore estimated prevalence/incidence of visual impairment after stroke as a figure of approximately 60% at baseline assessment.\u201d\n\nThere is so much that could be picked apart in this paper. Incidence and prevalence are two completely different things - but the author estimates both to be 60%, based on studies without robust methodologies? What?",

                    "comment": "I intend to repost this, based on the (rather aggressive) other commenter, but I did want to address that your comment is very off base. Dr. Rowe is one of the foremost researchers in stroke related vision loss in the world. The cited paper is a report for the Stroke association, but these numbers are supported by the Blue Mountain Eye Study and the [ASA](https://www.stroke.org/-/media/Stroke-Files/Lets-Talk-About-Stroke/Life-After-Stroke/Lets-Talk-About-Stroke-and-Vision-Sheet.pdf), among others. Drs. Biousse and Newman at Emory have found similar results when surveying their clinic.\n\nRowe has additional studies showcasing how many departments (evidently including yours) fail to collect visual information in stroke patients. A Stroke Association survey in 2010 asked \"Since your stroke, have you had enough help with sight difficulties?\" with 26% of patients reporting that their need was unmet, 35% had been met to some extent, and 39% that it had not been fully met. The reliance on 24-2 Humphrey Perimetry or confrontation fields is a major reason why vision loss after stroke is heavily under-reported. \n\nFor whatever reason, clinicians appear reluctant to address the extent of vision following stroke, despite the documented prevalence of PCA and MCA strokes. As a researcher in the field, it has been an uphill battle for quite a while.",

                                    "comment": "Yes, the NIHSS is insufficient at reporting the prevalence of visual field loss following stroke. Just the NEI-VFQ is insufficient at reporting the impact a stroke-induced vision cut has quality of life. Just as the SITA-Standard testing algorithm for the Humphrey Perimeter is insufficient at detecting stroke-related deficits, as it was designed to detect glaucoma but is still administered default for stroke patients (if full fields are even ordered). There is nothing wrong with saying we should do better for patients.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: It is recommended that you report a person as missing as soon as possible, especially if you have reason to believe that they may be in danger. Time is of the essence when it comes to missing persons, and the sooner law enforcement is notified, the better chance they have of locating the missing person. \n\nIf you suspect someone is missing, you should immediately contact your local law enforcement agency or call 911 as a Reddit user commented:\n\n&gt;***It could be the difference between finding someone who had a bad fall at home or getting lost in the forest, and finding their body.***\n\nI just learned about this from a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/141tdwu/what_urban_legend_needs_to_die/) on Ask Reddit, so I thought I would share it here.",

Same thing with physical descriptions, \"5'9, Caucasian guy with brown hair and eyes,\" means you're also not going to be finding that person. You can show me a photo of someone and I wouldn't be able to tell you if I saw that guy within the past hour or not. Like maybe if they did something that made them standout or something. \n\nYou need visible tattoos, limps, heavy scars, funny haircuts, dents in vehicle, unusual bumper stickers, and especially shoe styles. When people change up their clothes, they almost never change up their shoes but instead just put on things like hoodies or hats. \n\nkeep updated photos of these unique markers on your phone to show police and other people you interview.",

The former is, naturally, for missing persons, and the latter is for coroners/medical examiners or law enforcement to store information about persons who were found deceased, comatose, or otherwise unable to say who they are. These files cross reference each other\u2019s records nightly, so that, if a missing person is unfortunately found dead, the cross-referencing will help them be identified. \n\nThe cross matching is based primarily on physical identifiers, to include scars, marks, tattoos, medical conditions, blood type, dental records, etc. \n\nThe best way to increase the odds of an Unidentified Person record matching on a possible Missing Person is to PACK that Missing Person record full of as much information as you can. To facilitate this, the FBI has published a form that guides the reporting party through any physical identifiers that are cross matched, so they can provide this to law enforcement for the NCIC entry. \n\nThe reason why my suggestion is morbid is that I recommend people fill this out for themselves, their spouses, kids, or other loved ones, and keep it on hand, because it would be hard to think of these details in the moment when you\u2019re overwhelmed with worry and grief should the unthinkable happen. I also recommend, for the same tragic reason, that parents fingerprint their children and keep those records in a safe place.\n\nMany states make this form available on their websites, but I know for certain that the Texas Department of Public Safety has it available at https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/MP-4.pdf; every state uses/can use the same form.\n\nStay safe, everyone.",

I had an instance where I had the suspect on video, slam dunk case, and it took like 6 months for a detective at LAPD to even look at the file.  And it would fit as a felony per the statute.\n\nI'm basically saying people on Reddit have this Hollywood idea that the cops are like a concierge service that comes to your home, takes a report, listens to your frustrations, and then puts 5 detectives on a case to find a missing person or bust a burglar.  Because in the movies there are teams of cops who work together to bust criminals.  But in reality, unless it's a murder, or unless capital is involved, like a bank robbery, cops don't care that much.",

Big pickup truck from Georgia.  Dude followed me all the way to the 110 freeway and on the 10 freeway.  He kept lane changing with me and following me.  So I dumped him off on La Cienega Blvd where it's just \"no left turn\" for miles.  I was able to get a turn at the last second and get back on the 10 before he got stuck and blocked by oncoming traffic with no choice but to go north on La Cienega.  So he had to deal with that.  Probably took him an extra 15-20 minutes just to turn around because it's so dense out there.",

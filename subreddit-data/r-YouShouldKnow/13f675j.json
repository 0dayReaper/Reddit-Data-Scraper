Some people think gender identity is biologically determined and some say it's a product of a child's environment. Most likely, it's a combination of both.\n\nAnd at this age kids begin to associate certain behaviors, called\u00a0gender roles, with being male or female. Gender roles are culturally derived. What is masculine? What is feminine? How do boys and men behave? How do girls and women behave? As you decide what you want to teach your kids about gender roles, be aware of the messages they get both in and out of the home.\"\n\nIt is extremely environmental I watched my nieces and nephews around this age and that was around when (since they would begin school soon) my uncle and aunt had to start instilling boundaries since my family is traditional Mexican. This was basically \"boys don't hit girls\" if they were play fighting/wrestling \"be more gentle with your sister\" \"you shouldn't be grabbing certain areas/personal space\"  then ofc typically my aunt would shower/bathe with niece and uncle with nephew eventually this results in them asking why they can't be in the bathroom when X is there and whatnot. \n\nWhile don't get me wrong I'm sure some of it is self realization I think people really downplay how big a child's environment is when identifying gender and gender roles.",

That doesn't mean I'm any better at cooking them. \n\nWhen a child 'develops a sense for being male or female' that's not 'I have decided that I will grow up to be a man' that's more along the lines of 'I think I am more interested in playing with trucks than dolls.' Which is more male/boy centric to be more interested in the thing toy than the people toy. If I was interested in doing something like this, I could probably get a 2 or 3 year old to happily say that are both a boy and a girl by making simple arguments about things like 'Boys really like X do you like X?' And they would like it because I would make it chocolate or ice cream. Then do it again with girls and then they would happily say, maybe in the same sentence, that they are both a boy and a girl. Because they are 2 or 3 and they don't really understand why those groups are seperate or what the separation means. Then their parents would probably chase me away, because I've been talking to their child for a while and trying to make their child say things. \n\nLike, when I was a kid I spent a lot of time in my mom's walk in closet with my brother. We would tromp around in her (older) high heels and play with scarves and stuff. That wasn't an indication that my brother and I were hiding our true female selves. We just liked to play with our parents stuff and that's what we got into. The only time I thought about gender as a kid was when I had to go to the bathroom. When I was in kindergarten that wasn't that big a deal either as I think some kids would go in the wrong one and the teacher would politely tell them to use the other one please. The kid wasn't making a statement about their true gender alignment, they just really had to go and ran in without caring if the walls were pink or blue. \n\nIf an adult feels a certain way, do whatever you like. Introducing things that kids don't understand to them isn't making them any better informed than if you introduced astrophysics to them, and arguably gender is on the same level of comprehension to a 2-3 year old.",

He felt overwhelming gender dysphoria from an early age and came to the conclusion that he wasn't a girl by 11 years old. Granted,  there was a lot of other fucked up shit going on in his life during his childhood,  but the realization that he was a boy came from within. Nobody else told him until his family came clean to him until the age of 14. \n\nYou're talking about the formation of gender identity like it's something intellectual rather than instinctual. I'll never understand how people can believe that what gender you're attracted to is innate, but what gender you perceive yourself as is socialized.",

Social constructs are not inconsequential though, they can be helpful. \n\nNaturally, people tend to lean one way or another. Gender Dysphoria is incredibly rare. We shouldn't be like the past and tell someone who is suffering with Gender Dysphoria 'You'll get over it' same with someone who doesn't align with traditional sexual orientation (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual). Heck, as I've gotten older and tried to be more open minded I've found effeminate men attractive. Granted, mostly just in fanart, but one of my biggest life regrets is back when I was talking to a transgender individual through a dating app and I really clicked with them. But I was just starting to open myself to the idea (This was about a decade ago now) and I made what I think was one of my biggest life mistakes and told them that I didn't want to make them wait for me. I grew up in a traditional christian household. When I was in college I asked my mom if I was gay and without hesitation she told me no. \n\nEven naturally, I didn't think about or consider porn until i was 13, and I was a late bloomer as far as I know. \n\nbut what purpose does gender have before you take interest in the opposite sex? realistically, which bathroom you use. maybe in highschool or late middleschool you could start being made aware of what you find attractive or how you represent yourself, but until then why are we burdening children with these ideas? ideas that they honestly can't fathom. \n\nI know it's a bit of a dead horse, but it's like asking a child if they love someone. they ask you want love is, you give a nice family friendly answer because they are a child, and they'll say they love their best friend. that's not really love, not the love we understand. like, they might love their best friend like a brother or something like that. but we tend to use love as more of a husband and wife kind of love unless talking about blood relatives. \n\nBy your example with david, it even further enforces the idea that gender is a social construct. He was male, raised female, and he felt like it was wrong. We should allow kids to exist without gender. A better phrase would be, not pushing them one way or another. Bathrooms aren't gendered places. They are Sexually seperated places. As in your Male/female Sex , not your Boy/Girl/Other Gender.\n\n I think the problem more lies in how some of the present day thinkers fall in the hole of 'If it's a social construct, then it must be flimsy and stupid and we need to tear it down.' when in actuality Social constructs can be very important and beneficial even if everyone doesn't smoothly slide into it. \n\nLet's go with a more concrete social construct. Murder. Killing another human being is only really a bad thing because we want to live in human society. We get along better when we can peacefully coexist. So making it taboo and illegal to kill one another without provocation is a good social construct. So good that we enshrined it into law. That being said, some people don't work well with that restriction. We label them 'serial killers' and either 'Psychopaths' or 'sociopaths' depending on how they can't accept the social construct. \n\nA less stigmatized example is Introvert and Extrovert. Introverts were honestly somewhat taboo for a good portion of human history. not being able to socialize made you a bit of an outcast and would earn you wariness and not so positive rumors. Even if you were some sort of really nice woodsman who just enjoyed quiet days and nights in the woods and you would bring in firewood for other so the long winter wouldn't be so bad... Extroverts who couldn't fathom suffering through such solitude would attribute your introverted tendencies to guilt over some bad thing you must have done or maybe thought you were doing something bad out in the woods that you didn't want others to know about. It's only been more recently, with technology florishing, that introverted tendencies have started to shed their stigmas. \n\nTransgender/Gender Dysphoria, only got removed as a mental illness less than a decade ago. the stigma that it used to hold has been shed at a record pace by a lot of the population in first world countries. That isn't universal, but it's a start. \n\nHowever, that is not a good reason to overhaul the system that's been in place for time immemorable just to accomidate, if we are being honest, an extreme minority. Let's be honest, kids aren't hyper gendered one way or another except maybe by the peers. (Boys think girls have cooties was a big thing when I was a kid, so boys in my class would either not hang out with the girls or make fun of boys who did). \n\nWhen something like 'Drag Queen story time' happens, there are two thought processes I saw unfold. There was the traditional side, who thought 'Drag queens are a type of sexual performance, like a stripper, but it's a dude doing things a female stripper would do. why is essentially a stripper in front of children? that's oddly sexual in proximity to children.' on the other side, more new age, I saw 'Drag Queens show children that you don't need to fall into traditional gender roles. a man can dress up like a woman, that's perfectly fine.' they comlpletely cut out any sort of sexual connotation. \n\nThen, it went beyond story time, to pride parades where people would do more directly sexual activities despite children being present. The older rotund gentleman twerking in front of a little girl was a big example, and while conservative/traditional people were repulsed, and the little girl was confused and looking at her mom like 'I don't like this' but the mom tells the little girl to watch the man twerk. That was weird. Then, in texas and colorado, there was full on drag shows with alcohol, and people took their children to them. Conservatives balked, only partially because it was a drag show. it was because children were involved. non-conservatives balked and tried to say that conservatives just hate drag queens, but conservatives would have been just has upset if you took children to a normal stripper bar. It wasn't the drag queens, it was the sexual content with children involved. \n\nGender is social. It doesn't really effect children. Teenagers it starts to effect them, they are discovering gender when they start having relationships and stop thinking 'ew girls have cooties'. as they become adults they refine those ideas. maybe they get lucky, like my sister, and they date the same person from 6th grade through highschool and then get married in college. other people might date 50 people and realize in highschool 'I am not happy dating these people' and it isn't until college where they expand their lense and explore new avenues. in this day and age, highschools are more open minded and teenage guys might meet other teenage guys. That's not the normal course, but it can happen. Biologically, men tend to be attracted to women. That's just how reproduction works. That doesn't mean it's a rule everyone has to follow, but it's a step above a social construct. Again, that doesn't mean men have to be attracted to women, it's just the way it's more likely to happen. Similar, Males tend to align with the gender Boy/man. Females thend to align with the gender Girl/woman. That't not a hard rule, but it's also not something we are born knowing. \n\nSomeone with Gender Dysphoria isn't like 'Man, I wonder if I should have been born a woman...' It's more along the line of 'I feel so unnatural. my body is lying to me. My physical sex is a constant reminder that I am living a lie. If only I could be happy with who I am.' It's not some soft 'Gender is a spectrum and I'm on a journey of self love to find myself.' it's more like 'I need this surgery or I'm going to mutilate myself and or take my own life.' \n\nI know I ranted quite a bit, sorry about that. \n\nTL;DR Traditionalists are less upset that you are exposing children to the idea of gender than they are about exposing children to sexuality.",

Things are much worse and have been getting worse in the UK.\n\n&gt;However, that is not a good reason to overhaul the system that's been in place for time immemorable just to accomidate, if we are being honest, an extreme minority.\n\nI am not a gender abolitionist because I do not believe that gender identity is a social construct. The existence of 2 genders is fine to me, as long as there's the option for mobility between them. \n\n&gt;Biologically, men tend to be attracted to women. That's just how reproduction works. That doesn't mean it's a rule everyone has to follow, but it's a step above a social construct.\n\nThat's the same way that I conceptualize gender identity. People born with a Y chromosome tend to develop a male gender identity, but sometimes the sexed development of the brain fucks up and gender dysphoria happens. \n\n&gt;By your example with david, it even further enforces the idea that gender is a social construct. He was male, raised female, and he felt like it was wrong. We should allow kids to exist without gender.\n\nIt absolutely does not reinforce the idea that gender is a social construct. If gender were only socialized, raising him as a girl should have gone off without a hitch. There's a current they were swimming against in raising him female, and that current is the innate gender identity that he and everyone else is born with. There's evidence to suggest trans people share neurological similarities with the sex that matches their gender identity. More research is needed to establish a causational link, but the research looks promising. \n\n&gt;Granted, mostly just in fanart, but one of my biggest life regrets is back when I was talking to a transgender individual through a dating app and I really clicked with them.\n\nIMO being attracted to trans women doesn't make you not-straight and neither does jacking it to femboy hentai. If you conceptualize it some other way, I can still respect that.",

Men and women have different strengths and weaknesses due to their bone structure, muscle structure, etc. Women are better at some things (by and large) same with men in other areas. There are outliers, but on average men perform better in sports than women do, thus women's sports was made to not exclude them from professional play. \n\nAll this being said, I think Trans individuals should be allowed to compete in school sports up to a middle school level and then club sports for fun after that. I would exclude them from scholarship type sports, starting with high-school because talent scouts from colleges are looking at who they are going to give scholarships to. It's not because I want to exclude Trans people from sports. I'd be fine with eliminating gendered sports altogether if it wouldn't lead to more problems than it solves. \n\n-*-\n\nI'm fine with mobility between them, the problem comes with the when. Even conservatives have stopped telling law abiding adults that they can't do with their bodies as they please, even if they might complain that 18 is still to young to know yourself. \nAnything before 18, or when you become an adult, is the question at the moment, which is a huge step forward from 'you're just mentally ill.' That's why I say that Gender Dysphoria has made such huge leaps and bounds compared to other forms of stigma. If you hold out for 100% approval from everyone then you never move. \n\nThat still leaves the problem of 'what if someone is suffering Gender Dysphoria as a child?' Telling someone to wait until they're older is insufferable enough as a child when it's something you should wait for. It's also not a question I have an answer for, but I don't think there is a good one right now.\n\n-*-\n\nThe reason why I said David's story reinforced the idea that it's a social construct is because that doesn't make it a set in stone rule. Social constructs can be useful, but they aren't mandatory. Kind of like how we outlaw murder, but in war the idea of killing your fellow man isn't so taboo anymore. Similarly, Gender is not something that should be forced on children. They should be allowed to express themselves without influence. Whether that be a male expressing femininity or a female being masculine. The majority will default to the more natural Biological option, but that doesn't make it a hard rule. That being said, I shouldn't have said it reinforces the idea of Gender is only social. I was using it as more of a 'see how this isn't a hard and fast rule.' That's probably because I ramble. \n\nI am sure that as we gain more advanced technology things will improve, but until then we are like cavemen banging rocks to make fire. Even if we know what we might want, we aren't yet sure how to get there. Still, we are slightly more advanced than caveman, that was probably a bit extreme of an analogy, we at least know to use flint. Still working on the steel.\n\n-*-\n\nI'm not saying that fetishing feminine males means that I'm becoming more open minded, though I can see how it sounded that way, so that's on me not you. \n\nI grew up staunchly Christian. Even seeing a dick in Porn was gross to me. Which was a bit awkward because they tend to be there. \n\nWhen I met that trans person through a dating app, I was letting that part of me get in the way of who I was looking it. We didn't even go on a date so to speak. We just went and bought groceries for her, went to her place, and talked. She told me, and this has really revolutionized my ideas on love, 'When I first met you I knew you weren't my type, but you're becoming my type.' Which I think is something along the lines of 'Beauty is in the eye if the beholder.' \n\nThat aside, I was just trying to be nice because I was interested in them. Yet, despite my interest, my old way of thinking was nagging in the back of my head 'there's a penis' which in the end, despite how much we got along and perhaps even clicked if I'm not mistaken, I got in my own way. \n\nI'm not saying 'hey, these traps are kinda cute even though they got a dick'. I'm saying 'I've overcome a stigma that was all but raised into me.' Again, I understand why the misconception was there. It was my poor use of words. \n\n-*-\n\nThe last but first point. Children shouldn't be taught about straight or gay people. Made aware, sure. I didn't get sat down in third grade and taught about how my English teacher very much loved her husband. She just came in and was progressively more pregnant and one of the girls asked how babies were made and the teacher told us to ask our parents. \n\nThat's how it should be handled in school. Yet I have seen videos of teachers giving students the birds and the bees talks. Both straight and not. I don't think either are appropriate unless you are a health science or biology teacher, and even then with telling them to ask their parent's first. \n\nSaying something as nonchalant as 'well, men can love men, as much as men can love women.' Is fine. But any further and I think you are encroaching on the territory of the parent. Even if my parents gave me a rather belated talk myself. Just because kids are curious doesn't mean you should take an opportunity they aren't honestly mature enough for.",

I've met more black trans people than white. The problem is people's unwillingness to mind their own business and worry about themselves. What someone chooses to identify as is their choice. I don't deny that some people are absolutely hog wild about it, and that's not right. But the overall hatred towards trans and LGBTQ people is ridiculous. There's literally KKK groups out there we could be directing this hatred at. Politicians that don't speak on their people's voices. Billionaires not paying taxes. Police assaulting and murdering homeless people. But the fear and the attention is aimed at trans people because it's scary to the white guy that's never left his 500 population town and would have an heart attack comprehending a roundabout. We give the elderly and the rural folk enough power to control and manipulate the population centers when realistically they should be handled entirely separately from the civilized world.",

So weird and sad people actually think it does to the point it needs refuting.\n\nAnd a persons gender and their sex are \\*different\\*. Your sex is what set of genitals and physiology you have, your gender is entirely a social construc, and not mandatory based on your genitals. Female /= glitter, wearing dresses and getting your nails done, and male /= sports, fishing and monster trucks ffs. Gender is just a bunch of imaginary rules that changes based on your particular culture. \n\nAlso, drag queens and transgendered people aren't the same thing in any way either. Drag is a costume, with exaggerated features so people can see from the back. It's fun and entertainment, and they usually only do it when performing. Trans people are not \"in drag\". Drag is something people do for fun, to put on a performance. Trans is when someone is born in the wrong sex. They can experience horrible dysphoria. It's not a cartoonish mask they wear to perform occasionally.. Instead it's more a case of finally being their true sex. it isn't a costume they take off at the end of a night, but rather their life. Most drag queens aren't trans, and most trans aren't drag queens.\n\nSorry if I'm lecturing. So many people don't understand these differences, and these days the ignorance can really do harm. If you are going to hate people based on gender or sex or whether they are in drag or trans, you should at minimum know what it is you are being a bigoted ass about (not you, Saturn dude. You seem to get it)",

I try to make sure I understand the topic at least a little before I speak on it. I've been friends with a few trans women and currently am friends with a very nice trans woman I met at work. Honestly, one of the nicest and coolest people I've ever met. I try to judge people on how they treat me and how they act around others, not what they do in their free time or their skin color. As long as you're respectful and kind, we can get along. But as soon as I see a hint of \"I'm better than you for _____ reason\", I'm gonna tell you to get out of my face.",

The point is that back in the day (the good old days) males wore dresses until at least age 3, often for longer. It didn't affect their development because adults accepted it. Various inventions - stretchy synthetic fabrics, elastic, snaps, velcro, etc - made the creation of tiny pants for babies/toddlers a practical option. And then for some reason adults decided that it's wrong to let boys wear dresses. \n\nI'm saying we could decide to change our minds again &amp; stop making a big deal about it.

Young me wouldve hated seeing it, but I like to think I'd laugh about my young son doing that nowadays.",

                    "comment": "I used to babysit my friend's 3 kids on a regular basis. One time, the girl &amp; I were painting our nails &amp; the middle boy (5 yrs) asked if he could paint his, too. I wasn't gonna tell him, \"Sorry, you gotta find something else to do until we're done because this is a girl thing.\" (Also, painting nails is a good activity for developing fine motor skills.) So he chose black &amp; an army green color &amp; alternated the colors between fingers. He then spent the rest of the day parkouring around the house, putting his hands in front of his face, &amp; saying, \"You can't see me! I'm camouflaged!\" So even while doing a \"girly\" activity, he found a way to put a boyish spin on it. The addition of paint to the keratin growing from his fingers did not, in any way, \"feminize\" him.\n\nHe did sheepishly come up to me at the end of the day (it was a Sunday) &amp; ask me to help him take it off. Because even at 5 yrs old, he already knew he might get made fun of at school if he still had it on. And I simply said, \"No problem, buddy. Let me grab the nail polish remover.\" I hadn't forced him to put it on; I wasn't going to try to force him to keep it on simply because **I** believe it's silly for anyone to care who's wearing it.\n\nBut it did make me really happy to know he felt safe enough w/ me to even ask to put it on in the first place.\n\n[ETA - I hope that doesn't come across as me trying argue w/ you. I thought your post was quite sweet. Just adding another example of how letting children have fun w/out restricting their activities/clothing solely based on gender \"norms\" (which change over time, anyway) doesn't cause any harm.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: When buying a home, you should take into consideration if your neighbor has bamboo on the lot line, and you should be very cautious if you plan to plant some yourself. \n\nRunning bamboo spreads via \u201croot ropes\u201d call rhizomes about 6-12in deep. Each root rope will shoot up hard sharp knife-like shoots in spring and fall, making your backyard unusable for gardening, walking barefoot, inflatable pools etc. \n\nIf you absolutely want bamboo in your yard, you should install a hard plastic root barrier 2-3 feet deep and 6 inches high in a circle enclosing the bamboo, because it will dip or jump a bit when it hits something hard. If you do not, the root ropes can grow 5 feet a year in all directions, and it\u2019s a great way to damage any chance of a good relationship with your neighbors. \n\nLearning this the very VERY hard way as my neighbor has unrestrained bamboo that has shot maybe 25-50 ropes 10-25 feet into my backyard in a zig-zag pattern in all directions. Poison doesn\u2019t kill it, and if you leave a bit of rope it will start a new plant. You have to carefully follow each rope to it\u2019s end and dig it up individually or bring in heavy equipment to excavate your entire backyard and haul away the dirt. Then we need to dig a trench and install a hard barrier along the lot line if they don\u2019t remove the bamboo. We\u2019re 5% done and have spent 20 hours already. \n\nPlant responsibly y\u2019all. I\u2019m so tired.\n\nEdit: We are brand new neighbors and our current neighbors didn\u2019t plant this so if there was some sort of malicious revenge situation, both the planter and the shitty neighbor are long gone leaving us with hundreds of hours of work to do thats genuinely no fault of our own. Keep that in mind if considering planting this to eff up your neighbors yard\u2014it may not hurt who you hope it will, but it might decrease your home value and leave you open to small claims court depending on the laws in your city/state.",

They did not plant the bamboo (it was there when they moved in) and were absolutely horrified when they realized what it had done to our backyard.\n\nThere\u2019s really no one to pay\u2026 bamboo is rare in our area (it\u2019s more common in the south) so we kinda only have tree removal services which so far have been wildly unhelpful. It\u2019s not technical work, it can be done with a shovel and a spade, which we are doing, it\u2019s just EXTREMELY manual. I thought to request help from them on the digging but my husband thought it\u2019d be weird to have them in our backyard and they\u2019ve got their hands full with young kids.\n\nIt\u2019ll get done, through dirt sweat and time, so I\u2019m just focusing on spreading the preventative message \u201cfor the love of all things holy, plant running bamboo responsibly.\u201d\n\nEdit: lols I have seen the petty revenge. We just moved in, I don\u2019t live in Texas, have no exterior lights, and this is my side neighbor. I pinky promise I have done nothing to deserve this hellish punishment.",

I believe there are many places that treat this as an invasive plant and have regulations around it.

The energy they photosynthesize and store in their trunk/root ball is what powers the new shoots that invade your yard. Once the cluster loses any above ground foliage, the underground growth will start to slow down and weaken.\n\nSeems to me like they should be paying a landscaper to come around and remove the plants asap. But if you dont want to push that with them, maybe theyd be open to you coming onto their property to chop or down or even dig out the main root ball with a hired excavator.",

They are also spending the painstaking effort to pull up the rootballs which is also awesome.\n\nThat actually hasn\u2019t really helped us at all though. The canes in our yard are 6-8 feet tall. You would not believe how fast they are growing, I certainly wouldn\u2019t without seeing it with my own eyes. It\u2019s growing 3-6 inches A DAY. Hubs cut the top of one off as an experiment, and an hour later it had grown 1/4 an inch. You can literally watch it grow. It would be amazing if we weren\u2019t responsible for getting rid of it lol. \n\nBut lack of photosynthesis from the mother plant is clearly not slowing it down. It just needs the root system to grow. The trench were digging (to find all the root ropes) is about half dug, but we still need to follow most of the ropes. We\u2019re also considering giving up on a 10x10 foot section. It alone has 50 canes densely packed. Our own bamboo forest lol. By giving up, we mean letting the canes grow super tall and chopping them down only when they start to pop out leaves. Apparently this is supposed to use all the energy stored up in the roots and then chopping it down as soon as it sprouts leaves doesn\u2019t allow it to replenish that energy. We recognize we might have to do this next year too\u2026. but we\u2019re so tired. \n\nDon\u2019t plant running bamboo y\u2019all. Those in government should ban it.",

Like forty minutes with light traffic so not usually a very red area.\n\nI've seen people waiting for work outside a Mexican market early morning in the cold.  As in single digits (fahrenheit) land one guy had oven gloves on has gloves to protect his hands. Sadly one of my soulless co-workers made a joke about it and many others laughed too. This was with a crew of people who made barely minimum wage and did nothing but count inventory all day. Which takes some skill to learn well and can lead to future opportunities but it's mainly druggies and alcoholics working (I was one of them just not  as racist or hateful). I still feel bad for this person. I don't know him but the desperation to wear oven gloves to work makes me sick today. Way more than it did a decade ago. \n\nThis was Illinois USA and not in a terribly bad place. I pass by it daily to this day and so I remember this person. \n\nIf it was today I would've stopped my work truck and given him one of my pairs of deerskin gloves, insulated work gloves or straight up work gloves without a thought. I didn't have them back then because I was also poor as fuck (still am but I'm lucky) and didn't have anything to give him or the courage to stop the truck even if I did.\n\nOh and it's also definitely a thing in front of places that cater to manual labor. It's just usually early early early morning so they can make it to the job site on time. It sucks they have to go through that and it sucks that some of our most important employees are exploited like this.",

You can probably find them cheaper locally then buying online. Get the all-steel ones, the wood handles are the weakest link.

Thought it was pretty neat that there was bamboo on the back line of the lot to screen out neighbors... Until the next spring when I found it running 14 feet into the yard. There was some in a bed near the back corner of the house and I found it coming up in the front of the house. Found some on the opposite corner of the house as well. \n\nIt took a few weekends, but I dug all of it up. I did not want to be fighting with it to preserve a natural fence forever. Anytime I found a runner from a clump, any time I  found a random shoot, I traced it and surgically removed it. Alllllmost nothing came back the next year. (My back neighbor was pretty happy about it too.)\n\nThe next year I covered the entire area with 9 mil plastic sheeting to scorch and dry out anything that might remain. Left it there for almost a year. Didn't want to use herbicides because I was planning to change the space to a veggie garden.\n\nReally happy to report that I haven't seen any bamboo in two years. Damn that took some effort though.",

I barely touched it last year but this year I'm making it my mission to clean up the dead stuff from winter and stop whatever I can get to before it starts growing up again.\n\n Thankfully its not anywhere close to our neighbors yet, but that is one thing to keep in mind. But my god am I just so sick of this stuff, I just want to burn it all to the ground. I get to do more tomorrow too... can't wait. \n\nThat shit indeed spreads everywhere.",

They were really nice.\n\nHowever\u2026 the owner who did the remodel also planted bamboo along all of the fences. And white gravel everywhere else. Even though they tried to use plastic barrier material, the bamboo poked right through it. After two years, it grew all the way underneath the sidewalks and started to spread out. Then it started pushing over the wood fences. \n\nBy the time we moved out, after about 8 years there, it had gone through to the neighboring complex, under the public sidewalk, and just about everywhere. The gardeners kept cutting it down, but it grows so fast that they could never keep up with it. There were just footpaths around a small bamboo forest. Lol. \n\nIn the end, the complex got torn down to build a big condo building anyway, but I bet they will still be dealing with rogue bamboo for years. The stuff is unstoppable. \n\nAlso of note, we used to have a garden in our yard and did our own composting. Bamboo does not break down in compost like most plants will. Bamboo, not just the stems but even the leaves, take years to break down.",

After a few weeks we discovered that, if we forgot to turn off the basement lights, THE DEAD BAMBOO STALKS IN THE BASEMEMENT WOULD SPROUT NEW LEAVES AND COME BACK TO LIFE. That shit was like an alien horror movie. The running bamboo had spread from the fence line, through the back yard, under the back porch, through the cement and stone foundation, into the crawlspace/unfinished basement. All connected like some scifi hivemind/fungal horror. I'd wager it was eating its way into the pipes as well.\n\nI've never been so glad to NOT own the house I was living in.",

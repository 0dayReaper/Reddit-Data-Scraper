    "postText": "Why YSK: the debt limit crisis could induce a credit crunch. You should not count on a credit line being your \u201cemergency fund.\u201d Card issuers can decrease limits at will in the event of a credit crunch. If you have good credit but no emergency fund, you can usually get a 0% promotional rate. Best practice to protect yourself is to carry a balance on such an account while keeping the money you would use to pay it off in a savings account earning 3%+ APY, which not only protects you from a credit crunch but actually earns you a few hundred dollars in the process.",

A few weeks ago, I got an email from the issuing bank, not the store itself, saying that I have my full credit limit available to use. It listed the exact dollar amount I knew the limit to be. Mother's Day was coming up, so I figured I would use it to get some stuff and use the points to get myself something later on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 weeks after I used the card and spent under my limit, I logged in to check when the due date was. It says I am over my limit. Baffled, I look closer. They lowered my limit by 83% after I used the card. They lowered my limit by 83%, making my balance over the limit.  THEY PUT ME OVER MY CREDIT LIMIT BY LOWERING MY CREDIT LIMIT AFTER TELLING ME WHAT MY CREDIT LIMIT WAS.\n\nDon't ever open an account with Comenity, I mean Bread. They changed their name to Bread.",

You want to keep your credit lines somewhere between more than 0 and 15%. That nets you the greatest gain to your credit rating, which means you pay less in the long run. 30% max, between 15 and 30 the credit rating increase is smaller. 30 to 50 gets you no credit rating increase. Above 50 starts the negative credit rating.\n\nAlso, be aware your credit line is sampled once a month, BUT NOT ON THE DUE DATE. It might happen on the due date, but it would be a coincidence. For example, if you max out a credit card, but pay it off at the end of the month may get you a big negative credit rating. The sample may get taken at a time when the credit line was at near 100%, and that is the hit you will take that month.\n\nI have one credit card, and that is my also my emergency card. I pay EVERYTHING through it to accumulate points, but I have a weekly reminder on Saturday mornings to pay it off. I lay in bed and pay it down except for $10.\n\nI've done this for about 6 years now and have an 816 credit score and my card has upped my limit to $35k. \n\nCredit cards are a scam at the heart of it, but they are a legal scam. That means you can turn it to your advantage so long as you follow those arcane and unadvertised rules. I use an Amazon Chase Bank card; it nets the most bang for your buck as far as points, at least the last time I checked. I can pay for Christmas just through points I have churned through the card with while paying almost no interest.",

My rational was \"The overall stock market probably won't go down much unless everything goes to shit, and in that case, what good is money going to do me anyways\" so I keep a lot of my money in blue-chip and index funds, it may not generate the huge returns of people who gambled on Tesla, but it's made consistent returns over the last few years. Making a completely safe 4.65% is better than a lot of people (and better than the 0% you had before). The only thing to compare to is our previous selves, so I'd say you're doing fine",

Unsecured lines of credit can be cancelled but typically you need to have something change in your financial situation to trigger it.  If you are relying on intro rates on your loans or interest only loans you are more likely to get caught in a squeeze if your debt is called and you can't get the money together fast enough.",

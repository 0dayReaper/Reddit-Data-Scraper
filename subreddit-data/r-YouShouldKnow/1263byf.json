    "postText": "Why YSK: Don't let Amazon keep your money!\n\nRecently I placed 2 orders on Amazon for 2 of the same item, both about 30 dollars each - shortly after these were marked as cancelled (no notification or email, but I noticed). After this, I then reordered but as one order this time for about 60 dollars. After this went past the delivery date, I eventually had to contact Amazon and again cancel this order.\n\nA few days later I received a refund for 60 dollars, and I thought it was odd that it wouldn't have come through as 2 refunds of 30 dollars if it were from the first refund. It turned out, after I contacted customer service, that they never refunded the original order.\n\nThis prompted me to then recall an order I placed, and was ultimately canceled by Amazon without notice, back in December. I reviewed my statements and found that this hadn't been refunded either! I reached out to Amazon and they refunded it, but with over 3 months having passed, they had never refunded the item.\n\nCould be worth checking your previous orders for anything you've ever had canceled on you/reordered because of that.\n\nEdit: This was Amazon Canada. They were all items sold by Amazon.",

They only allow trailers of freight to return, and in a trailer of thousands of items - yours can get easily overlooked when being scanned in for their inventory. So the CSR\u2019s can\u2019t tell a thing about it because of their crappy ass communication. \n\nAlso, the bank just needs evidence of said tendering of return freight to Amazon, or advising it wasn\u2019t delivered due to cancellation. That\u2019s it. Amazon doesn\u2019t care, as easily put as I can say- their turnover rate in CSR leads to issues with training. So the veterans don\u2019t get to really stay long enough to make a good CST experience when it ppl call. It\u2019s like a new job everyday for 80% of their staff.",

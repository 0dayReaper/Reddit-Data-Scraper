Certain cars will also alert you via audio if your iPhone is connected to your car.\n\nAnd if you see one, you can always report it in the app to let other people know.",

We have a range of temporary traffic control products like sequential LED road flares and barricade warning lights - all of which have the ability to be published to Waze and Apple Maps - this is an automatic process so roadside crews don't have to take any extra steps other than deploying the flares or barricade lights. We also have impact sensors for crash cushions, attenuators, guard rails, any fixed asset, but are also used on temporary assets like TMAs (truck mounted attenuators), barrels, rail road crossings, etc. These sensors let DOT's or contracted maintenance companies instant notifications when something is struck and need to be repaired.",

I use it all the time even for routes I know well because with its number of users passing info to others it's like having a real life GTA minimap while travelling. It sucks for remote areas with more difficult terrain though since you see only streets nd stuff, not elevation. Getting to a cabin high above around other terrain in winter with a meter of snow around was quite challenging since we couldn't see which route is too steep and which is good, which cost us a lot of time driving around",

Meaning when driving it, the median speed naturally occurs, and the vast majority travel within 10 mph of that speed (above or below)  This number goes up as cars improve. \n\nThe studies show when the roads natural speed is 75 having it set to 65 doesn't change the speed, it simply causes more people to drive 10 mph above.  It's been shown to be safe, with no additional danger or accidents. \n\nHowever, what does cause accidents, is people driving 55 on that road in the left hand lane. \n\nStudies of the autobahn, show no difference in accident rate, but the severity of an individual accident tends to be more severe.  \n\nStates that have non commercial highways (NY has parkways where no commercial vehicles are allowed) have shown that there are fewer accidents on those roads.  Why? The differential in speed is less, as you don't have large commercial vehicles going slower.\n\nSo no.  Speeding isnt a problem. Lowering speed limits beyond the natural speed limit on a road, doesn't improve safety. It simply raises revenue for the locality.",

You're stating that the current speed limits are wrong (a fact I actually somewhat agree with you on), whereas I'm stating that going above the current speed limits is unecessary and dangerous.\n\nRegardless of how fast people can safely travel along a road, the fact remains that speed limits are there and so long as everyone follows them it mitigates risk. But the sad fact is too many people are complacent/arrogant/ignorant enough to wantonly ignore road traffic laws, and THIS is what causes accidents in thr majority of cases.\n\nLike I said, I do agree that certain speed limits need to be raised in accordance with better vehicle safety and control technology.

    "postText": "Why YSK: People often seal things up airtight if they're worried that it might begin to smell (e.g., compost bin, dishwasher, etc.) but that can actually make things worse. Sealing things up creates microaerobic/anaerobic conditions that favor the production of barfy stinky-feet short chain acids by bacteria. So, it's often a good idea to leave things open a crack to let some oxygen in. (Also, if you aren't running your dishwasher right after loading it, sponge off the water on the door before closing it  -- reducing the amount of water present also helps keep growth &amp; odors down.)",

In May 1988 their group treated the first ulcerative colitis patient using FMT, which resulted in complete resolution of all signs and symptoms long term.[20] In 1989 they treated a total of 55 patients with constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease with FMT. After FMT, 20 patients were considered \"cured\" and a further 9 patients had a reduction in symptoms.[49] Stool transplants are considered about 90 percent effective in those with severe cases of C. difficile colonization, in whom antibiotics have not worked.",

Traditional composting is aerobic and involves rotating/turning the compost to aerate it. Anaerobic composting is set and forget and makes a great starter for a garden bed. \n\nBeyond that, there are other methods like vermiculture (worm farms where worms break down organic material) and bokashi (anaerobic composting which ferments the waste products). Bokashi in particular is great for small spaces like apartments and has very little smell.\n\nhttps://helpmecompost.com/home-composting/methods/anaerobic-composting/\n\nhttps://thepotagerproject.com/different-types-of-composting/",

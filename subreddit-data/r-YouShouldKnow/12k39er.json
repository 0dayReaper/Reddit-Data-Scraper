It is required to say \"When you buy 'this amount' your price is 4/$10.\" Anything that just says 2/$4 or 3/$5 is automatically calculated at the register per unit. Obviously this is a sales trick. But the wording is very specific and must be/ will always be on the label. Also any required coupons digital or 'club prices' must be clearly labeled even if in small print, most states have laws requiring this but especially in California it is a Weights &amp; Measures auditable fine if it is labeled incorrectly.",

The only time they'll let up is if they only have one of the items in stock, but even then you have to ask the cashier to mod the price manually",

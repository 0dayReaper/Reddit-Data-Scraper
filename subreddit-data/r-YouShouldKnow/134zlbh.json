    "postText": "**Why YSK:** If you're a ChatGPT user, you know how useful it can be for getting quick and accurate responses. However, typing out a long prompt to properly express your problem and train ChatGPT can be time-consuming. Luckily, there's a solution: voice typing. By [adding the voice typing feature to ChatGPT](https://chatgbt.net/how-to-use-voice-typing-on-chatgpt/), you can simply speak your prompt instead of typing it out and save valuable time. Give it a try and see how much easier it is to communicate with ChatGPT!\n\n[Link](https://chatgbt.net/how-to-use-voice-typing-on-chatgpt/)",

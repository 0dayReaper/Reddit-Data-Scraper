If someone steals your cookie, they can change your settings, log you out, and completely hijack your account, even with 2FA/MFA enabled. Only their Advanced Protection option, requiring multiple physical hardware FIDO keys, will protect you against a full account hijacking.",

            "comment": "In case anyone wants some additional clarification on this topic, I presented this to ChatGPT and got this response:\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThere is some truth to this statement, but it requires some clarification.\n\nGoogle's default 2FA/MFA method is using a verification code sent via SMS or generated by the Google Authenticator app, and while this method is generally considered to be secure, it is true that it is vulnerable to certain attacks such as SIM swapping, phishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nHowever, Google does offer more secure options for 2FA/MFA such as using a security key or the Google Prompt feature, which sends a push notification to your registered device. These methods are more resistant to attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nRegarding cookie hijacking, it is true that Google's 2FA/MFA does not protect against this type of attack. If an attacker gains access to your session cookie, they can potentially access your account without needing your password or 2FA/MFA code. However, it's worth noting that cookie hijacking is a relatively rare form of attack, and there are measures in place to prevent it, such as HTTPS encryption and browser security features.\n\nGoogle's Advanced Protection program does offer additional layers of security, including requiring multiple hardware security keys for authentication, which can provide even stronger protection against various types of attacks. However, it's important to note that this program may not be necessary for every user and can come with certain limitations, such as restrictions on third-party app usage.",

Cookie hijacking is a real thing and quite damaging if pulled off, but it\u2019s also an involved task and rare unless you\u2019re a valuable target given how much goes into it. \n\nEverything is about threat models. The average person is far more likely to lock themselves out of their account because of misplaced hardware keys than they are to be the target of a cookie hijacking.",

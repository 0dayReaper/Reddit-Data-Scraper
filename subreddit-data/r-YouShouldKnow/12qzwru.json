It weakens the cleaning power of both the baking soda and the vinegar, and all you're left with is some salt and some water (and some CO\u2082).\n\nIt's the same reason people think hydrogen peroxide is effective at cleaning wounds, even though it's nowhere near as effective as simple soap and water. The fizz makes you think it's doing more than it is.",

It brings up all sorts of crap. Let it sit until you can no longer hear or see the bubbles. Then finish up the job with really hot, near boiling, water.\n\nA word of caution do this only if you know the plumbing in your house and understand how things vent, drain and so on. It could potentially cause problems with your drain but it's still generally safe to do in most circumstances. \n\nI agree, it's pointless for cleaning.",

The slippery feeling you feel is more or less your skin being chemically removed. If you have much detergent residue left in the drain it will catch more stuff. I imagine too much soap is partly to blame for some clogged sinks. Just be sure to use plenty of hot water to rinse.",

The bubbling action itself helps break down what you are trying to clean off better than the baking soda or vinegar could by themselves.

            "comment": "You are mostly absolutely right, but a couple caveats. \n\nThere are possible applications for mixing vinegar and baking soda that leverage the expanding gas pressure of the CO2. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t conflate the fizzing of baking soda and vinegar with peroxide. Yes, both offer the same kind of show, but peroxide is actually doing something. The issues with using peroxide on wounds has nothing to do with it not working. The problem is, peroxide is killing healthy cells and beneficial bacteria as well as any potential infection so that the net effect is bad for wound healing.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Your intentions are probably kindly but the quickest, most efficient, and above all SAFEST way to process traffic through a multi-way stop sign is for people to take their right of way, in the order that they arrive at the stop. Waving people through to be friendly or because you aren't sure if it's your turn throws a giant wad of uncertainty into a rigidly mechanical and very safe system of prioritizing traffic. Pay attention and know whether it's your turn, and be friendly on social media or at the park.\n\nBonus tip: if you arrive simultaneously with someone who is crossing the intersection against your path, you can remember who has the right-of-way with this mnemonic: the person on the RIGHT has the right of way.",

The check my husband got from the dude\u2019s insurance barely covered medical expenses, forget about time off work, etc. And that\u2019s with a decent lawyer (who didn\u2019t take that much, mind you). He could\u2019ve started litigation, but really, how much can you get from someone who buys bare minimum coverage for their car? Meanwhile you still need to pay your lawyer through the whole uncertain process. Being awarded and collecting are very, very different things.\n\nEdit: Suing someone rich isn\u2019t great either. A former neighbor was awarded a few hundred thousand (at least) in settlement after some rich asshole broke her back, but she hasn\u2019t been able to collect for years now. Offender simply left the country to travel the world for a few years or some such. Nobody\u2019s gonna hunt them down across the globe, and at some point those judgments expire.",

You have to wait and intuit it from traffic flow, which isn't all that reliable in some places. Seasoned drivers coming up to the blinking yellow may realize this and have to adjust if there are drivers at the red that could incorrectly enter the intersection ahead of them. Confusion ensues.\n\nAnd then some dimwit stops at the yellow to be polite and, yeah, chaos.",

You're supposed to go out into the right lane and wait until it's clear to signal and get into the left lane. It sucks if you're immediately trying to make a left turn but it is what it is. Same as people turning at a stop light and shifting to the outside lane in the middle of the turn. It's extremely dangerous.",

One lane closed on 35 and everyone gets over into the open lane miles BEFORE YOU EVEN SEE THE *FIRST* CONSTRUCTION SIGN, then when you try to pass all the cars to zipper properly, some (usually) old person in a car clearly built in the 60s will slip out of their lane in front of you to block you from passing by going the same speed as the other lane. It's absolutely infuriating. Oklahoma has some of the worst drivers education, imo. My mother learned how to drive in OK bc she was born and raised there and actively insists she is a \"safe driver\" bc she \"has never gotten a ticket in her whole life,\" but every time I'm in her Lexus that smells like her BO, I'm actively scared for mine and others safety on the road. She break checks, she intentionally cuts people of if she feels like they are going too fast, she refuses to drive at or above the speed limit (always tops of just below speed limit and will hit brakes to maintain speed instead of coasting to slow), uses a blinker but hits her breaks before even turning it on. Just to name a few. This is why we need reoccurring driver's ed across someone's entire lifetime, not just once when they were teenagers and say \"you can get from point A to point B? You're good for the rest of your life.\"\n\nEdit: typos",

Traffic from other exits were already going around anti-clockwise (the correct way in the USA) and thus this white haired person had multiple examples of using the roundabout correctly. They stopped for a while (maybe 60s?) and then slowly turned sharp left to go the wrong way around then another sharp left to exit. So many people stopped and shouting at them, but they ignored them all and went their way.",

Don't come crying to me when you want to blame the person that waved you on for the accident. That shits 100% your fault",

Now they're stopped in the middle of the intersection to avoid collision, still trying to motion the other across. But now the waving has evolved into pointing and shouting, with an obligatory F-bomb and pointing at one's head.\n\nThing is, people here aren't at all nice to begin with, so I don't know where this pretense of civility comes from.",

If both of you are turning left, you theoretically could both go but it's better to make eye contact and have one of you yield.\n\n4-car case: Einstein demonstrated conclusively that in a cosmos consisting of a space-time continuum, the concept of simultaneity is basically rubbish and no two events can occur at the same time. So certainly no FOUR events could EVER occur at the same time, even allowing for slop and approximation. Therefore, this case never occurs and I don't have to solve it.",

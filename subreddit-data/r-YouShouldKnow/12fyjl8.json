Also, they are required by law to send you several notifications in advance before your property gets escheated. These notifications happen months before your money gets touched. \n\nNot to mention that they send you periodic statements from the moment you open the account. Those statements should have been showing that you suddenly started being charged \u201cfees on fees.\u201d A simple phone call to them would probably have resulted in those fees being reverse and the timeline to get escheated reset.\n\nA lot of people like to think \u201cbanks bad, credit unions bad\u201d but not all financial institutions are created equal. However, ALL financial institutions are regulated by federal and state laws. You are blaming the CU for doing something they are required by law to do because **you** didn\u2019t bother monitoring your own money.\n\nAnd finally, I actually see the lists of members who are going to have their account escheated. In all my years in the industry it is RARELY anyone who has a lot of money with the CU. Generally speaking only 5% or less have over $20,000 (which is not a lot of money for financial institutions even if it is a lot of money to you). Even if that $20,000 gets loaned out the credit union might stand to make around $1,200-$2,000 in interest over a period of several years.\n\nPeople like you who don\u2019t know how the banking system works and how to use it to your advantage is exactly why everyone says schools should teach financial literacy. Because then you go to the bank/credit union complaining about a problem that 100% could have been avoided.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your situation isn\u2019t frustrating - it absolutely is frustrating to have to go through bureaucrats to gain access to your money. What I\u2019m saying is that you are not entirely blameless in this situation.",

It\u2019s a net benefit whether it goes in an exec\u2019s pocket, goes to shareholders, or helps the CU members.  \n\nIt was a secondary account primarily used for depositing expense reimbursements once per month.  Should I have checked it twice per month to make sure they weren\u2019t screwing me?  Yea I guess.  I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s not their fault for not sending notifications (text, email, mail, carrier pigeon, or otherwise), or even picking up the phone and calling me if they aren\u2019t getting a response any other way before emptying my bank account.  I\u2019m lucky that it didn\u2019t ruin my life, because most of my money was in a different account, but for many people it would have.  You can try to make that sound ok and put the blame on me, but it\u2019s not ok, and reeks of victim blaming.  If I have to police my account to make sure they aren\u2019t literally stealing from me (for the fee side), then maybe they should pay me for my efforts.  There was no fine print that said they could just take my money whenever they wanted, so I better watch out.  \n\nYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s my fault for making sure they didn\u2019t steal from me instead of blaming them for stealing from me.  I bet you think rape victims were asking for it because how they dress too, huh?  I get it, you\u2019re biased because you work for one, but Jesus Christ.",

I called the 800 number on the receipt and they told me I had to sort it out with MY CU.\n\nI called my CU and explained what happened and surprisingly, they believed me. I didn't have to go in or show them the receipt or anything. They fronted me the cash so I could pay my rent and THREE MONTHS LATER they notified me that it had finally been sorted out.\n\nThis was not some error, the system had to be programmed to do this. And based on my CU's reaction, this was not something new.\n\nFuck Chase.",

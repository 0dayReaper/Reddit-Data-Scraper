The switch for the door is a safety switch, it's just to make sure the oven isn't operating with the door open lest some dumbass manage to nuke an appendage. It's not designed to actually turn the magnetron (the \"microwave\" part of a microwave oven) on and off, that's what the on and off buttons are for. \n\nOne of the primary causes of premature microwave oven failures is door safety switches burning out. Considering that microwaves are generally considered disposable appliances (good luck finding someone willing to repair a broken one, and DON'T try fixing it yourself), being a little proactive can save you a few bucks down the road. Let the timer finish or hit the \"OFF\" switch before opening the door.\n\nEDIT: Quite a few folks seem deeply offended by this post, as if it's required reading or something. [Here's ](https://youtu.be/oC9PufP0UtI) a video I found with more info, but remember...watching it is optional, there won't be a quiz tomorrow.",

The high voltage transformer and capacitor can hold a lethal charge even when unplugged, the magnetron can permanently blind you if you point it at your face while powered, and it's insulated with a ring of beryllium oxide which is like asbestos on steroids if it breaks apart and gets airborne.",

It sounded like an explosion. We went into the garage. One of the springs had broken and hit the washing machine on the opposite side of the garage. My father called somebody to replace the spring. We also got a new washing machine since the old one had a huge dent in it. \n\nNow imagine if the washing machine was a person. \n\nNewer garage door springs have safety features to keep them contained when they break, but they still break with a lot of force.",

You don't see the average person trying to use those, however. If you need to hold 50 or 60 pounds on the end of a 30\" bar to wind the spring, holding that same torque on an 8\" bar will require 200lbs. So you jam your longest screwdriver in there, start to loosen the set screw, and get that screwdriver yanked out of your hand with enough force to lift you off your feet. \n\nOh, and anything unfortunate enough to be caught on the suddenly spinning part is probably going to go around the axel between 3 and 7 times.",

I worked telecoms, and knew a guy that accidently touched the top of his head to an active BUS bar, putting out *way* more power than anything a desktop PSU has, and he sure as hell didn't get thrown anywhere. He was dead before he could here the steel toes in his boots explode, but it sure as hell didn't *move* him. At best, the PSU will give you a shock that will cause your muscles to contract, making you throw *yourself* across the room. I can find reports of people working on AC units in industrial settings being thrown by electrical arcs, but you're talking 500v+ systems, and at that point it's the ionization if the air creating a blast wave to force you backwards. Compared to the 110 or 220 that a computers PSU has access to from your home power supply, I'd wager your entire fuse box would explode before your PSU pulled enough power to launch a human through the air. In fact, your desktop generating an arc capable of throwing you would be enough to literally vaporize most of your computer. The case would be turned into a metallic vapor cloud, the room fills with ozone as plasma tears apart the molecules in the atmosphere, and the smell.... Well, a flash arc can reach temperatures as high as 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit, over three times the surface of the sun. Shrapnel can approach the speed of sound at that point, meaning whatever part of your computer didn't turn into plasma is now a hand grenade. And that really is an apt comparison; an arc blast capable of throwing someone across the room is comparable with *actual explosives*, and your houses fuse box and wiring absolutely will not let you pull that kind of power, because power grids today run on 110 or 220 volts, a far cry from the 500+ needed.\n\n\nIn short, no. Your home is pulling 220 volts, because that's what the national grid is set up for, and none of your home appliances are going to be able to pull the 500+ volts you would need for an arc blast capable of throwing someone across a room.",

Those switches are connected to a control board, and THAT controls the flow of electricity to the magnetron. The switches do NOT have any direct connection to the magnetron, which is on a different circuit. The switches use low voltage DC for their operation, and the magnetron uses high (very VERY high) voltage.\n\nThe switches wont burn out. Theres literally no way for them to burn out unless they are defective from the manufacturer. Pulling the door when the microwave is running wont burn the switches out any more than pulling the door after it's finished cooking.",

You're right, the switches operate whether the microwave was running or not but with 230V AC (here in UK) running through the switches constantly. I did see occasional switch faults on them but I would struggle to argue they \"burnt out\" from the door being opened while the microwave running. Probably more likely a mechanical failure of the switch or sometimes a build up of crap on the contact meaning a closed switch has a higher resistance than it should causing the microwave to sense the switch as open when it is in fact closed. Depending on which switch is causing the problem it could trip an internal fuse or it could cause odd things like the turntable to rotate even when the microwave isn't running.",

It doesn't turn off or anything when the microwave turns off, it's just a latch you either press a (non-electronic) button to release or just pull on the door.\n\nThe door will have to be opened just as much as an off button would be used.\n\nPlus if it's a cheap microwave there's no way they're checking the lifetime of the switch. If you're lucky they'll forward on the lifetime of the magnetron/capacitor they bought. It would have been electrically tested but the lifetime wouldn't be dependent on the switch.",

But still, both were good models in good working order. So then I had an electrician run a new dedicated circuit to the cabinet and got a microwave that consumer reports said was super reliable. Nope.

In order to keep the high voltage components isolated from the user controls.\n\nI would suspect that bargain basement microwaves is where you'd see this kind of failure where every single corner is cut to make the cheapest product possible.\n\nLet's put it another way, if you have a microwave fail because the door switch barbecued due to it being hooked up directly to high voltage or the magnetron itself, **do not buy from that brand ever again**.",

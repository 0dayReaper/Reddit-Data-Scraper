When you are filling out a form and it says \u201cList all members of your household\u201d it means list all members of your household. Which is a financial term defined by people you have joint expenses with and dependents (simplified). They never asked list everyone who lives at your address. Or they would ask that. \n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me google \u201cwho are the members of my household\u201d and you will find 100s of healthcare, insurance, debt/credit, banking, and government websites explaining the exact same definition for this. Not a single source will tell you it means list everyone at your address. Google financial aid/charity care while you\u2019re at it and see you\u2019re wrong about that too\n\nAlso this isn\u2019t a process mediated through vendors and it isn\u2019t debt forgiveness. What op is talking about happens through the hospital billing department. As does the program they calculus the bills for low and no income people. It\u2019s called financial aid or charity care and every public hospital does this. And they follow the same strict privacy laws that the rest of the hospital follows. It\u2019s a ducking hospital.\n\nYour thinking of some weird debt forgiveness scheme or something but regardless. Unless they ask you to list the people who reside at your address they aren\u2019t asking about your roommates. If you sent someone that info cause you didn\u2019t understand thats on you.\n\nWhat op is talking about is done the same as charity care and fun aid and is mediated by the hospital itself and not a insecure vendor.",

So we simply forego it a lot of the time out of necessity. \n\nEuropeans like to mock us for it, but it's really not funny.

You have to sign up for Medicaid, and if you have any income above destitution level, you will only qualify for an ACA plan that costs hundreds a month in premium, has crushing co-pays, and huge yearly deductibles. \n\nWhat's worse, you can only apply during the brief enrollment period each year. \n\nEven if this mythical \"financial assistance\" were available at some hospitals -- the same qualification limits would apply, and it would be impossible to know in advance what might be available, in an emergency. \n\nIf you can't see the value in just giving a fake name for most emergency room visits  -- broken bones, concussions, penetration wounds, even a heart attack, etc etc etc -- then I question whether you've ever actually been in the kind of situation you're claiming wisdom about. \n\nNo emergency room has immediate access to your medical records, in any case. If you have drug allergies, you should know and say so. For follow up care - know your own history and assert what you know. This is not to say one should go into long-term medical treatment with this strategy, but to avoid tens of thousands in debt from a sudden emergency room visit, you'd be a fool to tell them your actual billing info. \n\n\"Medical debt doesn't affect credit rating\" means nothing -- you will be hounded for the rest of your life by debt collectors if you give your actual name and identifying info.

Nearly every thing you just said across multiple topics is simply wrong. \n\nOnce again it\u2019s like you\u2019re not even reading anything. \n\nI actually have, like I said, used financial aid multiple times.\n\nAnd not just little trips to the ER to get patched up. Trips to the ER that result in several week long admissions. Outside of that I go to the hospital about 3 times a month to access various clinics for my specialty care. Which is why it\u2019s glaringly obvious that you know nothing about how healthcare actually works on the ground. Including financial aid/charity care, Medicaid, and just basic processes of receiving treatment at a hospital. \n\nLike your records: actually they are available with the snap of a hand at nearly any hospital in the US since just about any hospital you go to will use epic. I could go to a hospital system I\u2019ve never been to and they could access all my records on epic immediately. In fact I just did that a few weeks ago for an emergency heart attack protocol. \n\nThis has nothing to do with Medicaid. This has nothing to do with debt relief or any of the shit you\u2019re talking about. You can even get the billing department to take debt back from collections by telling them you\u2019re eligable for this service. \n\nFinancial aid isn\u2019t some vague concept (although it\u2019s most certainly readily available). It\u2019s a well established program that exists at EVERY PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY. It isn\u2019t insurance. It isn\u2019t debt. It\u2019s a program that pays/removes the remaining bill for you if you are low or no income. You literally just ask the billing dept. for financial assistance and insist you can\u2019t pay and they will hook you up with the application. Just like OP is talking about a program that pays 15% of the bill for you if you can afford it and pay upfront. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the ACA. Or insurance, your talk about plans that cost hundred of dollars and require crushing premiums or enrollment periods is completely irrelevant. The is regarding the amount remaining on your bill *after* you insurance pays their portion (like I said) or if you have no insurance then just the whole thing. \n\nBut funnily enough you\u2019re completely wrong about all that as well. You\u2019ve clearly never heard of presumptive eligibility. Which is where if you show up at a hospital or health care provider with no insurance and they suspect you would be eligible for Medicaid (no actually eligible - just possibly) you get PE and they can admit you under full coverage Medicaid care until you are able to enroll. \n\nAnother thing you\u2019re wrong about: The vast majority of the time they won\u2019t and actually can\u2019t garnish your wages for medical debt. Prior to coronavirus it was already banned and extremely limited in many states to begin with. And it requires the debt collector or hospital to go to court to get a judgment so you will know and have opportunity for a payment plan if by some extremely rare chance it happened. Which it won\u2019t bc in most of the few states that allowed it in the rarest of cases - they put a moratorium on it as a result of covid. \n\nIf they somehow got through all of that there are limited income streams they can garnish. Many are protected from this. And the few that aren\u2019t they can\u2019t still only garnish a limited amount of income that is exclusively deemed to be disposable. They can\u2019t take income you need to meet cost of living pay rent and utilities buy food etc. and even of your disposable income they are only permitted to take 25% OR\nThe amount of your income that is more than 30 times the federal minimum wage. \n\nAnd actually no, debt collectors won\u2019t call you for the rest of your life. Debt that can\u2019t be collected through legal action and has been uncollectible for years loses interest to them. It\u2019s not hard to block their number for several years. I\u2019ve done it. Once outside the statute of limitations they can\u2019t do anything about it. Why would they waste time on that. \n\nSo yeah I didn\u2019t mention wage garnishment bc the threat is negligible to impossible for most people. \n\nAnd I never said that there\u2019s no situation where there could be value in giving a fake name. But rather that there are several better options. Bc the hospital knows when you give a fake name. You aren\u2019t pulling one over on anyone. It means they don\u2019t have any ability to access your records. And you will receive a lower quality of care and potentially even be discharged when you need more care. \n\nAnd if you need anything more than a doctor to tell you you got a boo-boo and send you home you\u2019re fucked. Because you will never be able to pick up your medication from the pharmacy. And you will never be able to get any records proving you have said condition and need for ongoing treatment. Or what usually happens is they don\u2019t even diagnose you they tell you you could have cancer or whatever it is and give you a referral to follow up with a specialist which you also won\u2019t be able to use. God forbid you need a transplant and have to admit to committing a major crime at the same time they\u2019re determining whether you deserve treatment to live\n\nAnd that\u2019s a hell of a bad choice to choose when you have several other options and if you\u2019re unable to pay one of those options is most likely having the entire bill covered by financial aid/charity care. Which you won\u2019t even need if you get presumptive eligibility coverage.\n\n(I\u2019m saying this btw as someone who has also given a fake name before) and it made the trip practically a waste of time although I didn\u2019t have any other option given my circumstances.)",

Thanks for making this day better!\n\nEdit2: After it was all said and done it was thankfully much more organized than at first glance. It was just a lot of things in a small space ( sooo many shoes ). We got them all moved in and they treated us to a lovely dinner!",

We asked a couple of family friends if they would help and they of course agreed. The days leading up to move out day I was swamped with work and used that to justify not helping her pack out nearly as much as I should have. Move out day arrives and we have a living room piled with unboxed things we wanted packed up and taken to the UHaul. Our friends were bros and we did order some shitty pizza for everybody, but I can only imagine how frustrated they were with us. Took almost an entire morning and afternoon. My wife did her best, so I really blame myself for being THAT guy who did this to her and our family friends. *Cringe x100.* I was such an ass.",

For example, it's generally accepted that you need to bother airlines and online retailers for hours to get refunds for products and services not delivered upon here. It's insane. People just roll over and take it. I grew up in the US and I literally do not understand our culture of just \"letting it go\" or accepting that you'll need to spend 2 hours/day for 4 days for a solution. When you're out a few hundred dollars on a shoddy product or service never rendered/done improperly, people here seem to accept that this is the way things are, rather than refusing to do business with companies like this, submitting complaints, etc.",

I don\u2019t know how often the average person moves to a new place in their life, probably like ten times or less, that\u2019s not a lot of time to gain experience and efficiency, these companies and their employees do it EVERYDAY. However good you think you are at moving that couch down the stairs or loading a van, you are no where close to how good they are. I was shocked at how quick these guys are and how careful they are with your stuff. In an industry were there is pretty much one rule: don\u2019t damage anything. The companies that survive are the ones that follow that rule like the word of God.",

Now, I've always been one to offer help, so I did.\n\nI turned up later on that evening, nothing was packed, she was frantically shoving clothes into bin bags and her boyfriend and a mate were stoned as fuck on the couch while she's giving them hell about the situation. So I ignored them, and just started getting the larger stuff out to the van on my own. I've moved a lot of stuff and it's not as hard as it seems.\n\nEventually the lads start moving stuff, but they're a hindrance more than anything so me and the girl get most everything in the van on our own. \n\nWe get it all to their new place, start loading stuff into the house, and I get told that the couch is going to her mum's house instead. I'm still not pissed off though, cos I'm thinking about all the free cobs I'm going to get.\n\nI finish getting everything but the couch in, and take it to her mums. Get there, and it won't go in the front door. The front window is double glazed, but it won't go through that either. In the end we find a screwdriver and I take the front door off, get the couch in (just) and put hte door back on. The mum then starts talking about the TV i'm going to take to her sisters. \n\nOK, so that's what we're doing now is it. lol. I get the TV into the van, and the mum takes me to one side and gives me \u00a350. I really didn't want to take it, I was doing someone a favour and it didn't seem right, even after all the hassle. In the end she kind of shoves it in my pocket and off we go to the sister's.\n\nI take the TV in, with the girl and her boyfriend, and girl's older brother is there. He's a fucking mountain. He starts going off on one at the boyfriend, like properly shouting/punching/throwing him around and all sorts.\n\nTurns out, older brother is the local gangster. His mum had called him and told him what had happened. He'd gone to the sister's to let the boyfriend know exactly how upset he was with him. I went out the van to sort out the blankets and stuff to shoot off, and older brother comes out, tells me his mum really appreciated what I'd done, and shoved a wad into my hand. I told him that his mum had already paid me more than enough and he just kind of laughed, slapped my shoulder and told me to take it. So I did. \u00a3500.\n\nNot a bad night's work really.\n\nAnd nothing happened between me and the girl, I was married and really was just doing her a favour.",

Apartment moves are inherently more limited in scale because of the size of the place. Relying on your friends to help you shift an entire house\u2019s worth of belongings is not reasonable. Don\u2019t put that responsibility on your friends. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to be in the position to purchase a house, you need to budget for professional movers. If you can\u2019t afford that, you\u2019re not ready to buy a house.",

Always ask for their food and beer preferences a day or two before. Alternatively, margaritas. \n\nDon't do pizza in the middle of the day or during a \"break\" because most people will be tired and eat themselves into a greasy, lazy mess. Like me. I do that. If a mid-day break for food and rest is needed, have subs and sodas at the ready.\n\nKeep water and Gatorade available and in the fridge at both locations all day. Also have hand wipes and clean towels out where people can access them easily.\n\nIf you're moving during the summer, make sure the AC is going full blast at both locations and set up extra fans. It's never enough, but it helps. \n\nIf you're moving to a house and have a friend or family member that can't help with loading/unloading for whatever reason, have them go to the new place about an hour before you finish unloading and let them man the grill. Better than just pizza, IMO. Automatically turns a bleh moving day into a housewarming party. And again, margaritas.",

We worked like dehydrated slaves and finished at 5pm. My parents were so grateful to all her friends (who were almost all gay men), they treated everyone to a dinner at a really nice restaurant, her friends were super funny so we all stayed talking, drinking and eating for a few hours. which racked up a huge bill because everyone was starving. I ate myself sick with shrimp scampi, steak, stuffed mushrooms, bread, salad, mashed potatoes and dessert. I had to emergently go behind a tree on the way home my stomach hurt so bad.

Open boxes are awkward to carry.\n\n- Wrap crockery in baking paper, works surprisingly well.\n\n- Start packing a full week or two before moving and start with stuff you havent used in 6 months, then 3 months, 1 month, etc. Its a good way to split up a sometimes gargantuan task while still being able to access day to day stuff\n\n- Load up your car the day before the actual moving day.\n\n- Hire professional movers. If you're a skinny weiner boi like me this is a great idea. Moving pros are incredibly strong and efficient; they were able to move all my stuff in 2.5 hrs when it took me 6hrs with a friend.\n\n- get an esky to keep your perishables. Food cost adds up fast",

Like people buying your way out of the draft during the Civil War. Then you can have a group of friends pay for your movers and then go buy pizza and beer for your buddies anyway.",

I was supposed to help with another friend and all 3 of us planned to move everything from a 3rd floor apartment to a uhaul on the street. Well of course my friend bailed so it was just me and the girl moving. It was in the middle of the summer and as hot and humid of a day as it could be in Kentucky. No AC on the third floor and the apartment was COVERED in dog and cat hair and I could smell cat urine throughout the place. The girl who lived there was a coworker and  a very intelligent person going to grad school. She was a very nice person... BUT Her apartment was DISGUSTING and she hadn\u2019t packed anything. It was a hot mess and I hated that I was covered in cat hair, sweating my ass off, walking up and down 3 flights of narrow stairs all to the aroma of cat piss. I think it rained for a few minutes and then the sun came back out only to evaporate the water and make it more hot/humid. Got really drunk that night and the next day was equally as exciting when we moved her to another city.",

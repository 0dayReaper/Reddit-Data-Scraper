Communication boards can be essential tools for people with:\n\n* autism spectrum disorder\n* speech apraxia\n* stroke\n* dementia\n* traumatic brain injuries\n* deafness\n* selective muteness\n* learning delays or disabilities\n* intellectual disabilities\n* ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease)\n* disabilities related to surgery\n* intubated patients\n\nYou can use communication boards to:\n\n* express a simple message, such as \u201cI need to use the bathroom\u201d\n* ask questions\n* offer choices\n* display a schedule or structure\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.healthline.com/health/communication-board](https://www.healthline.com/health/communication-board)",

We still don\u2019t know what she was trying to say and will have to live with that for the rest of our lives and it sucks.",

The full spectrum of her life can be given much more meaning with this cryptic way of these parting words.    \n\n\nIt's just a new fresh perspective to give your relationship with your grandma a complexity of possibilities in how you might receive it.  Hopefully this could bring more value and lessons can be learned from taking on this positive perspective.   If you'd like to or not.... is up to you.  I'll leave the rest to your more than capable hands.",

It makes total sense why it still hurts--her passing is still so recent, and even if it wasn't, you'll likely always miss her just the same. It's very painful, but it's going to be okay. Accepting and going through loss is extremely hard, but I believe in your ability to find solace one day and feel at peace over losing her. I hope that those memories brought back good feelings even though there was a lot of hurt too. It'll get easier for you; I'm sure of it :) I'm proud of you for getting through it as far as you have, and here's to the future to come where you're more at peace! It's going to take time, but given enough patience and compassion from yourself, you will get there. All the love to you :)",

    "postText": "Why YSK:An estimated  47% of Americans don't drink enough water to stay properly hydrated, which can lead to negative effects such as irritability, dizziness, trouble focusing, tiredness, constipation, muscle aches, headaches, dry skin, short-term memory problems, and many other negative effects.\n\nAn average person needs to consume roughly 0.5oz of water per pound of body weight per day, but your individual needs may vary, this can come from drinking water, drinks with water in them, or even the food you eat, alcoholic drinks generally don't count towards this as alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it makes you pass more water than you normally would through your urine.\n\nProlonged dehydration can result in kidney damage and in more severe cases of dehydration, seizures, kidney failure, muscle damage, hypovolemic shock (low blood shock), coma, and death.\n\nIt's very easy to become dehydrated without realizing it, usually drinking when you become thirsty is enough to stay hydrated, but in some cases you may not become thirsty until you're already dehydrated, a good indicator is urine color, it should be a pale yellow, contrary to popular belief, clear urine usually means you're drinking too much water.\n\nIf you notice symptoms of dehydration you should seek fluid intake as soon as possible and drink at a moderate pace until symptoms subside, don't chug water as this can cause an electrolyte imbalance and cause complications.\n\nEdit:Reword on daily water consumption\n\nSource: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086",

It may even be the opposite; some have naturally more efficient kidneys and thus need less water intake to flush toxins. The science is still pretty unclear, with most science saying the vast majority of people (especially young &amp; healthy people) should drink when they are thirsty.",

That's a loooong time to be rid of those two nasty's. Most people who don't drink enough, it depletes the reserves and then when a birus or bacteria hits. Like the cold or flu, your body doesn't have those extra reserves to fight them off so they get infected.   However, I must admit, I got covid from my wife who is director of nurses at a local surgery center.  In two days, and I truly believe  this because I've read so much about it, that when you have a strong immune system covid turns it against you. In two days it killed the nerves in my right leg, snd I can no longer drive or barely walk. Certainly not enough to go to a ball game.  And I got covid brain big time. Omg.  The things I used to know could fill libraries. Not! Lol.",

Also in terms of thirst, look for mild thirst (I have a slight desire to pour myself a water right now), not waiting till really dry mouth thirst. Best is pee colour, try to get it clear or only mildly yellow in the stream colour.",

    "postText": "Note: From the discussion below, I realise it may be more appropriate to say **reframe** rather than **revise** the story.\n\n**Why YSK:** There\u2019s significant evidence that story editing can improve mood, reduce depressive symptoms, help you find clarity and achieve closure on upsetting experiences. Having studied the research on mental health and tried many approaches myself, I always come back to story editing. It\u2019s accessible, works for problems big and small, gets your mind unstuck, you name it.\n\nTECHNIQUES: You can do a sort of brain dump, where you write without stopping or censoring yourself for 15 min (a form of the[ expressive writing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/expressive-writing-for-mental-health) pioneered by James Pennebaker). Another effective way is to write about an upsetting event from a third-person\u2019s perspective ( a form of[ self-distancing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201901/the-art-self-distancing)).\n\nIf you think about it, it makes sense - we are storytelling creatures, after all. Sometimes the stories we tell get us into trouble and the way out is to learn to take control and not get frozen in bad stories.  \n\n\nEDIT: Wow, this sort of exploded. I did not expect such a wide-ranging conversation. Thank you everyone for having such a deep, exhilarating and wide-ranging discussion with me. That's what I love most about Reddit!   \n\n\nFor anyone who wants a deeper dive into the theory, practice and studies on self-distancing, [here's a great write-up](http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1-s2.0-S0065260116300338-main-2.pdf).  \nAnd if you just want some practical tips to get started, [this place](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gaining_perspective_on_negative_events) a good one.",

I personally dislike handwriting, and it takes too long for me to write the sort of thoughts that I want to spill out when journaling. Typing largely keeps up with them, and is much easier for me.\n\nAs for why to journal? I don't even know how to describe it. It's just something that, when you do it, so many good things can spring up from it that you never expected. It's like going to bed and anticipating what you're going to dream about... it could be anything, and it could be way better than you could have imagined.\n\nI'll try to describe some benfits though.\n\nCleaning out my clogged mind. I don't know if I have ADHD, but either way I typically have a rollercoaster of thoughts and emotions bouncing around in the noggin at all times. It's hard to pin down exactly why *not* writing my thoughts isn't healthy, but all I know is that when I write out my thoughts and feelings, I feel just better having them out there. It's like... by literally actualizing them outside of my head and into the world (via a computer document), something about it feels relieving.\n\nThat's pretty basic to say it's relieving. But it's so much more advanced than that. It's about all the many ways that you feel relieved by it. OPs example of story editing is just one example, but it's certainly a big one. When writing out self defeating attitudes, I look back and think, \"hmm... that isn't good...\" and then write out stuff like the \"rewrite\" examples given by EspressoSheep.\n\nOrganization. I'm able to pin down exactly everything that's going on, being able to keep track of literally EVERYTHING in my life. Not to mention that if such things are giving anxiety, by writing them all out, you can plan how to address it, and feel better just from that. By writing everything out, you can IDENTIFY anxieties which may otherwise be elusive because you just let it slip around in your mind without shining the spotlight on it--the spotlight being the act of writing out all your thoughts and feelings.\n\nPlanning in general. Even socially. I'll write out conversations that I have with other people inside of my head. I'll write out thoughts I want to talk about, to make sure they're coherent. I'll write out arguments I imagine, or memories of such, and maybe rewrite them. Reflect on them and see if I gain insights for or against me.\n\nOr write out ideas in general and see if they have legs or pan out.\n\nAddressing fears. Just writing down things I'm scared or nervous about, and then writing all I can think of about it. Many times I realize that fears I have are overblown, and then they can dissipate.\n\nI don't even know. I feel like this is just the tip of the iceberg. All I know is that my life is usually in a much worse place when I'm not journaling. It's in a better place when I am journaling. And I think it has a lot to do with actually journaling, and everything that springs out of the act.\n\nAs for what to write? Anything in your mind. Anything. Everything. You just start writing what's in your mind, or whatever is present for you, and you just follow where it leads.\n\nIt's more or less on par with meditation for me. The act itself can be pretty meditative. I feel like everybody should journal. Or at least everyone who's like me and needs the structure and unknown fruit that springs out of it.",

She was very much in love with me, but the feeling just wasn\u2019t there for me. \n\nI found the best thing was to acknowledge that love wasn\u2019t there without finding reasons to demonize her. People would ask, and I\u2019d say I just wasn\u2019t happy. They expected me to go on with typical reasons. But... there were none. I just wasn\u2019t happy. She\u2019s a lovely person. I wish I was happy with her. \n\nAcknowledge what the base truth is. Work on accepting that very base truth. It\u2019s very hard to fully accept it, but one day you will. You\u2019ll wake up one day, and your burden will simply be gone. \n\nYour struggle to that bright day will be long, but it won\u2019t be forever. I\u2019ll be happy for you when it does.",

The story is about what these facts mean in your life. A failed test can be a bump in the road or crushing all your dreams. And to a large extent you can decide and write the story yourself, which ultimately helps your mood, outlook and psychological well being.\n\nOtherwise we'd all be horribly depressed because we're all less successful than Jeff Besos and we have to realize we'll never be as successful than him and there's almost a zero chance we could ever catch up. Yet this fact doesn't impact most people very much and a lot of people don't even know who he is.",

The same fact or event can be interpreted differently and neither interpretation is more or less true, it's just subjective.\n\nWhen you edit your story, you don't edit facts, you edit what you think about it. A failed test can mean the literal end of someone's life because they kill themselves over it, others just continue on with their lives, try again or try something else. The fact remains the same, the resulting conclusions are extremely different.\n\nThe original thought might not be your most beneficial. If you beat yourself up over a break up 5 years after it happened and the relationship was only a year... you're probably overreacting and you should find a way to think about the relationship and the breakup differently, for your own sake especially.\n\nWe're mostly a result of our environment and everything influences us all the time. The way we think about things doesn't have to come from our environment or society, but it very often does. There's an idea what is \"normal\", what is \"success\", but not a lot of people always match these expectations.\n\nAnd again: accuracy is not the goal. It's a therapeutic tool to achieve mental well-being. You look for different interpretations of the events in your life that form a better story that makes you happier.\n\nEverybody is already doing this anyway: most people decide to post positive things about themselves on social media. They take pictures of nice things in their lives. They tell each other positive memories and forget the negative ones. It's what keeps us sane and what's the benefit of being depressed all the time because everything in our lives can also be interpreted as mediocrity.",

For a start how is \"a failure\" defined, and who gets to judge that? What if you are an awesome parent or brother or whatever else. What if you go on to be very successful in a different field, are you still a failure because you failed the LSAT?

Your dominant hand is your present self, and your non dominant hand is your inner child. I didn\u2019t know where to start either, so I just asked my inner child how she was doing and the conversation went from there. My therapist suggested this because you get a very physical representation of your inner child (since your non dominant hand looks like of like children\u2019s scrawl) and kind of tricks your brain into removing you from your responses.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it will definitely work, but I personally did learn a lot about my own inner struggles and where they come from from that conversation.

There's an excellent example provided wherein a couple were involved in a serious multi-car crash and, though uninjured themselves, were both traumatized in completely different ways. The husband's PTSD symptoms when evoked in a...I want to say fMRI machine?, manifested as panic, with elevated heartrate, sweating, shaking, etc. His wife's trauma response was the opposite - she reported that she \"felt nothing,\" in an almost absolute dissociation from herself. It fascinates me that their individual responses to the same experience have a physiological basis. And it's encouraging to me because, for me, when I'm battling off a panic attack, I *know* it's \"all in my head,\" but it turns out there's some evolutionary haywire-ness at play, as well. And we can, through practice, learn to overcome that hiccup.\n\nI'm also working through \"Things Might Go Terribly, Horribly Wrong\" by Kelly G. Wilson, PhD, and if you haven't checked that one out, I 10/10 recommend it, as well. It's more of a workbook, with various exercises aimed at praciticing managing our anxieties &amp; other trauma responses like I mentioned above. Really, the bottom line agreement between these sources suggests that the key is to practice being fully *present in this moment,* as opposed to ruminating on depression - which is us being stuck in the past - or ruminating on our anxiety - which is us being focused on the unknowable future. I'm no Buddhist, but meditation practice is definitely helping me, as found in this book along with other kinds of exercises offered. And the general tenets of Buddhism - impermanence, for example - seem to align with the thought-modification recommended as therapy for trauma survivors.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, lol. This difficult journey has been a fascinating study!\n\n*Edited to add: I hope you're coping while working through your trauma. You're not alone, and if you need to vent, PM me. I'm happy to lend an ear. Peace to you, internet stranger &lt;3",

There are even meditation breathers that kind of look like dog whistles to help you slow down your breathing.",

Then do what you can to confront it. If it doesn\u2019t exist right now, then you are suffering something that hasn\u2019t happened. Once you realize this, you can find peace in mindfulness; you will know you can only interface with the present. Trying to solve or predict problems from the future will only hurt yourself.",

The first is that your feelings are valid - this year has been fucked up in so many ways &amp; nobody can make you feel happy about shitty things. Accepting that can sometimes help just a tiny fraction on its own. Then the second thing is basically putting in the work of trying to look after yourself &amp; make yourself feel better. People can be happy without travel or a lot of money or sex, which isn\u2019t to say that you should be grateful for what you have but rather be hopeful that if other people can find peace just within themselves than you probably can too. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work &amp; life still sucks but that\u2019s what people are talking about when they talk about \u2018right now\u2019 - literally this exact minute. We were taught to try to find something for each sense that would be nice - something that smells nice like a candle, tastes nice or soothing like a hot drink, feels nice like a soft blanket or a cat to pet. This sounds a bit hippy-ish or maybe like something you\u2019d read in a magazine but honestly you can accumulate little moments of happiness in your day if you notice these things &amp; they can add up to make a difference. I\u2019m not promising you\u2019ll be dancing around the room, but you can feel better than you do right now.",

            "comment": "Cognitive behaviour therapy is similar. It goes that your thoughts, actions, and feelings are an endless cycle which affect your mood. The key is to interrupt one of those three, which has a cascade effect on the other two. Changing your narrative, as OP suggested, is a good way to change your thought patterns, and from there your actions and feelings will change.\n\n\nFor example, if you steal something (action) and have guilt/shame (feeling) you will have negative self-talk such as \"I'm a bad person\" (thoughts). If you change the \"story\", you are changing your thoughts: instead of \"I'm a bad person\", you can tell yourself something more forgiving such as \"I'm human and I made a mistake\" (thought), which will alleviate the guilt/shame (feeling) and you are unlikely to steal again (action). Obviously this is a very simplistic example, but I hope it gets the gist across. \n\n\nIn my experience, the human brain is actually quite dumb and is easily tricked by this process (which is why I figure propoganda works). If someone says \"fake it til you make it\", this is essentially what they mean. When you tell yourself these cringey, fake cheerful thoughts (\"I love myself! I'm a good person!\") your brain is dumb af and will actually start believing it after a while. It's all about practice at identifying the negative thoughts and changing the narrative, which is very difficult and can take years in my experience.",

Then identify how and why you succeeded or failed that goal during those events (I over slept by 2 hours, I walked out the room when my brother brought up his political beliefs, i didn't show up to my first day of work because I thought I didn't deserve to have that position and they would probably have fired me anyway). \n\nThe most important part is if you failed the goal, you then write: how you could have succeeded, why the success would have been better and how to implement that solution in the future. (Go to sleep earlier/ set an alarm to stop binging the TV show, compile a list of skills you have proven your merit in already and reaffirm that they wouldn't have hired you if they didn't think you would make them money, etc.)\n\n\nAn added bonus is if you then see a psychologist you can bring the book and have actual events to point at as well as frequencies and related variables to help them help you even more effectively. \n\nHope this helps!",

Mr. Rogers actually spoke to Congress (or the Senate? sorry, I don't know much about North American government) about this as well, and it goes something like this:\n\nWe all have an internal monologue. That voice inside your head, constantly narrating your day. We all have it. If you're reading this, and thinking to yourself \"I don't have an internal voice\" - *that's the voice, saying it*. It doesn't need to be \"verbal\", it is just the part of you actively narrating what you're reading, thinking, doing, feeling, experiencing.\n\nYou, the *real* you, are the AWARENESS of those thoughts. You aren't your internal monologue - YOU are the \"indwelling being\" who is AWARE of that internal monologue. The same way you can be aware, \"I hate when I see Limp Bizkit on TV\" - you are *aware* of that feeling. If you can be aware of the feeling, *you aren't the feeling*. It's your internal voice, talking about whatever it is you're experiencing.\n\nThe issue is that we become mesmerized by this inner voice. We just start listening to everything it says, good or bad. And, most of the time, the voice is very cynical and very negative - and the best part? Even if you solve its \"problem\", even if you fix whatever the particular melodrama your \"mind\" is focusing on, it will just change the goal posts and move on to something else.\n\nLet me give you an example. See if this sounds familiar. \n\nYou could be driving down the street, and your \"inner voice\" will be saying things like \"There's the post office. I should remember to check for my room mate's parcel. Nah, I'll do that tomorrow after work. Oh, *shit*, tomorrow is my sister's birthday. Ugh, I'm going to have to phone her. Maybe I can tell her I'm busy. No, I shouldn't. I should just buck-up and call her. I know I'll be happy once I do. It'll mean a lot to her. What do I need from the grocery store again? Oh right, tortillas.\"\n\nAnd so on. As you can see, your inner voice will play both roles - the one bringing up a point (good or bad), and the one responding to it (good or bad).\n\nThe key is to *become aware of this awareness*. By realizing you can become *aware* of all of these feelings/thoughts (just try it: next time you feel angry or frustrated, see if you can catch yourself, and go \"oh, huh, I felt angry just now\") - you can see that you don't have to give in to them. You can just allow them to come and go, like the passing of a breeze. You, the consciousness, don't need to give in to the melodramas of the mind/inner voice.\n\nIf you want to know more about this, seriously, get the audiobook \"The Untethered Soul\", narrated by Peter Berkrot (original author: Michael A. Singer), and listen to the first 4 chapters (takes about 60min). It can be life-changing in terms of learning how to take control of your life by taking that seat of consciousness, and not allowing yourself to be the helpless passenger of the melodramatic mind.\n\nHope everyone has a peaceful 2021 &lt;3\n\n(edited: clarity)",

It\u2019s so effective for overcoming trauma and challenging ones own beliefs that Stanford is currently running a study on it. I\u2019ve used it a lot in my life and it\u2019s super incredible and absolutely grounded is science in the way that it functions.",

They need the help that therapy provides to be able to engage in these techniques, and engaging in them alone will reinforce that feeling of self-defeat because they will try something that is \"supposed\" to help but then doesn't, and then they stop trying - And then, if they do engage in therapy, they have even more significant hurdles to overcome.\n\nNon-medical professionals should not dole out pseudo-medical advice - which this is, whether that is intentional or by accident doesn't matter.",

But I feel you, because that is exactly what prompted me to write my response.\n\nJust remember that your journey is your own: nothing that \"works for the masses\" is going to work for you, and that's okay. Go at your pace, keep going to therapy, and keep going to the gym. Every victory that you get, every day, counts. Even if that victory is just getting out of bed in the morning and trying again. \n\nAnd perhaps a little context for this post will help: never forget that OP's \"helpful tip\" is exactly so unhelpful because it's not *practical*, and it's not practical because it cannot be. What does that mean? It's not practical, because it doesn't actually give you a practical way of applying this supposed excellent technique. Why does it not do that? Because the way you apply this is different for every person, and happens at different stages in the therapeutic process.\n\nYou are not bad or wrong or insufficient for not being at the point in the process where you know how to do this successfully. You are just on your journey, and that journey is made by putting one foot in front of the other - Which is exactly what you are doing. Keep going.",

If we have negative emotions weighing down our ability to function as adults, that's prolly a sign we're taking the wrong perspective of whatever from our past triggered the development of associated symptoms. Edit.\n\nTldr; the science IS COOL and real. All I have to do though is practice the maturity to realize that how I felt about something in the past isn't how I have to feel about it now.",

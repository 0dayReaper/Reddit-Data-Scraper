He had to prove he was not an Axis Powers sympathizer by renouncing his Italian citizenship and becoming a U.S. citizen.  So my father is eligible to apply for immediate Italian citizenship but his younger brother who was born in 1946 is not.",

Born outside Ireland to an Irish parent\nIf you were born outside of Ireland, you are automatically an Irish citizen by birth if either one of your parents was born in Ireland and was entitled to Irish citizenship.\n\nSo my Dad was born in N. Ireland before 2005 which makes him \u2018entitled to Irish citizenship\u2019. He never actually applied for Irish citizenship though. I was born in England to an English mother and my Belfast Dad. So am I the child of an automatically Irish citizen or am I the child of someone who didn\u2019t exercise that option which makes me ineligible?  He has passed, so applying is no longer an option for him. \nAny help to understand this would be greatly appreciated.",

You will also be, by default, an Irish citizen. To \"get your citizenship\" (which you already have), you would need to apply for something, like an Irish passport or whatever. When you apply, your birth certificate should have your parent's place of birth, if not, then you provide your dad's birth certificate as well. He was an Irish citizen (born in Ireland), therefore you, as his child, also are.\nSource: it was (not sure if it still is) the same for people born before a certain date to a UK parent, my husband (born in Canada) is a UK citizen because his father was born in Glasgow, but immigrated to Canada at 12.

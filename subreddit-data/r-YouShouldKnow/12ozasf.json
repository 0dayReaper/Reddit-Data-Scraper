    "postText": "Why YSK: TP is something we all have to buy and buying the right kind will actually save you money.\n\nThe tip: I\u2019ve been experimenting with my TP use. I buy Charmin Ultra Strong at Costco, and I have noticed that for all but the dirtiest back door jobs, I can use just 2 squares just fine. When I go to public bathrooms, by comparison, I wind up using a silly amount and even then, it\u2019s not 100% that a finger doesn\u2019t pop through.\n\nI feel like this should be in LPT, but they don\u2019t allow hygiene posts.\n\nI would estimate that I use at least 10 squares of the cheap stuff meaning your TP would have to be 5x cheaper to break even.\n\nAt my Costco:\n.0037/ square - Charmin Ultra Strong\n.0017/square - Marathon 2-ply\n\nNot a scientific analysis by any stretch, but this works for me.\n\nEDIT: Go ahead and put bidet comments in, but many many people on this planet don\u2019t have access to one, room for one, or don\u2019t want a wet ass. I too have used the technological marvels with control panels in Japan and Europe. Someday I\u2019ll post my violent diarrhea in Tokyo story but today is not that day.\n\nEdit 2: Added the missing zero.\n\nEdit 3: [You asked, I delivered Posted the Tokyo Violent Diarrhea story in my new sub: /r/FamousPoopStories](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamousPoopStories/comments/12pfba4/the_tokyo_violent_diarrhea_story/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1)",

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes \"Boots\" theory of socioeconomic unfairness.",

This can be attributed to many factors such as lower quality materials and/or materials that are more eco-friendly but much less durable, outsourcing to cheaper labor sources(which usually entails a drop in manufacturing quality), planned obsolescence. \n\nAlso, something not mentioned is that higher quality boots may last longer, but they still require possibly costly up keep considering the price of labor these days(ie having your soles replaced, which can run anywhere between $80-150).",

Don't settle for anything with polyester or other plastics in it: they fall apart fast, and shed microplastics that are bad for the environment to boot. Reliable clothes can also be a mix of natural materials and last a long time. Though rayon (a natural plant fiber that has been dissolved and reconstituted) can be pretty hit-or-miss, ime.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't really expect to pay less than $50-100 for a natural material shirt, unless you don't want it to last. As a person who was raised super poor, I get how this advice is entirely inaccessible for most people",

Wash inside out. wash cold. Dry with low heat, or don't hangdry in the sun if you don't use a dryer. Modern detergent is so good, we don't need to wash with hot water anymore, that just leaches dye from the materials. Whites don't need bleach every wash. I've had the same set of full cotton shirts for 20 years, they wear out from use or getting eaten in storage (mothes and mice love eating fabric), not the laundry machine. \n\nSynthetics are good for cold weather and athletic stuff, and socks.

Check out a storefront if it's an option but they have a website as well. Patagonia is quality but not the best bang for buck. They do have a yearly half off sale if you wanna stay brand loyal. My favorite brand is Marmot. Sierra gets them quite a bit. Super high quality stuff that lasts years. For pants I can't recommend Prana's stretch Zion pants enough. I rock climb and hike in abrasive places and those pants can handle anything. They look professional enough for work, you can do the splits in them, and I have my first pair still from 9 years ago. Check out campsaver during sales and you can get them for like $40. Another great source of discounted gear.",

Then carefully tear off the peak of the triangle, and unfold it and you'll have a square with a small hole right in the middle.\n\nNow you can stick your index finger through the hole and the toilet paper square kind of acts like a smock, or a 'poop kilt' that shields your hand from the poop, with just a single bare finger poking through. \n\nNow wipe your ass by scraping all the shit off with that one bare finger, and when you're done, grab the poop kilt from underneath and wrap it around your finger, wiping it clean on the way up. \n\nFinally, retrieve the small turn off piece from earlier and use it to clean under your nail.",

It became an issue because I used a lot more and he started whining that he shouldn't have to pay as much.\n\nObviously, this led to a debate on whose situation was more normal. After extended research and just asking every friend we had, we cracked the code. It's hair.\n\nI'm a relatively hairy guy, plenty of body hair. He's virtually hairless, can't even grow a beard. \n\nAnd the trend holds, if you have a hairy asshole it's difficult to get it clean with paper alone and you use a lot more. I know this is unpleasant to talk about, but Im honestly posting because it actually helped me a lot to figure this out. Made my hygiene life a lot easier.\n\nIf anybody is a hairy guy who's been trying to crack this code, a bidet makes all the difference.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: because people buy blue-cut lenses in a desperate hope of the digital eye strain prevention, but the only thing these lenses provide you is a better sleep cycle. Melatonin is a hormone that your brain produces in response to darkness. It helps with the timing of your circadian rhythms (24-hour internal clock) and with sleep.\n\nHarvard:\n\n&gt; Exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. Light at night is part of the reason so many people don't get enough sleep\n\nNPR:\n\n&gt; The only thing they(blue-cut lenses) may be good for is that studies have shown the blue light can interfere with our bodies' light cycle. So we all have natural rhythm so that we know when we get tired, when it's time to go to bed. If you want to look at your screen late at night, which probably isn't a good idea - but unfortunately many of us still do, then the blue-blocking filters might be useful in that regard.\n\nall the visible lights and specially the blue light from the sun tell your brain to decrease its Melatonin levels so that you're not sleepy during the day. but we still have blue light exposure during the night while staring at digital screens, thus the mind is tricked to think that the sun has not set yet and it leads to the low levels of Melatonin. so the sleep cycle is disrupted. blue-cut lenses help with that.\n\neh! what to do then!?\nwe need computer lenses to prevent the digital eye strain and computer lenses can either have blue-cut coating or not. Our eyes naturally converge when we look at things in an intermediate to near focal length and this can be quite tiring on our eye muscles when we keep them there for hours at a time. computer lenses can help with that: decentered Pupillary Distance (PD) refers to the process of slightly reducing a person\u2019s normal PD (the distance between pupils) by about 3-4 mm when creating computer glasses. This is accomplished by adding a slight magnification to the lenses. Our eyes naturally converge when we look at things in an intermediate to near focal length and this can be quite tiring on our eye muscles when we keep them there for hours at a time. By decentering the lenses, our eyes are getting some help to stay in that converged position.\n\nmakseuseof &amp; eyeinfluence:\n\n&gt; If you're constantly struggling with eye strain, feel pressure on the outside of your temples, or get light headaches after sitting in front of your desk, it may be time to try out computer glasses. Computer glasses, as they are defined by an eye care professional, should have, at the very least, a slight magnification in the lenses.  This magnification (or whichever power your eye doctor may prescribe you) is essential to reducing eye strain and fatigue. Our eyes naturally come together a bit when we focus on something up close and keeping our eyes in this position can cause our eye muscles to fatigue, making it harder to keep focused.  The power in the lens provides some much needed assistance by helping keep your eyes in that converged position.\n\non top of that, the distance between your eyes and the screen, the position of your body and the screen, your blinking habit, and 20 seconds of looking at things that are 20ft away after 20 minutes of looking at the screens play a significant role in maintaining the eyes health.\n\nsources: [Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/21/969886124/do-blue-light-blocking-glasses-really-work), [eyeinfluence](https://www.eyeinfluence.org/post/computer-glasses-vs-software), [makeuseof](https://www.makeuseof.com/pros-and-cons-of-computer-glasses/)",

At least so far, I haven't seen any meaningful definition of it. Your eyes can adjust to distances. You have a muscle to focus closer. But you're never straining those muscles. Straining a muscle has a somewhat clear definition. You can get headaches or feel bad in vague ways from looking at backlit screens up close for long periods of time. Is that eyestrain? I don't know. Kids in asia have gotten remarkably worse nearsightedness in &lt;2 generations, so there's a strong hypothesis that abundant sunlight, properly focused, tells the eye to stop growing, which stops it as it bulges outward, from flat (farsighted) to pointy (nearsighted). I wouldn't call that eyestrain, but if the hypothesis is correct, then getting sunlight, especially on developing eyes, is really important.\n\nAlso, while light exposure may decrease melatonin secretion, my understanding is that light breaks down melatonin, so it's really important not to clear your melatonin late at night, so keeping light exposure below a threshold or outright minimized is important for falling sleep on a schedule.",

Even if we settle down to your approach of statistics(!) then there shouldn't be a significant difference between UV-A and UV-C as well!

You actually believe them, and must, to remain rational, until/unless evidence comes along to shove you off them.\n\n&gt;if you claim something and there's no evidence for it, then it's your responsibility to prove it and not mine to disprove it\n\nAlmost correct. The burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim. I can claim god doesn't exist, and it is in fact YOUR responsibility to prove it does. Every positive claim must be proven, and the only way to prove a positive claim is to disprove the null hypothesis against it.\n\n&gt;otherwise you better believe that there's an imaginary spaghetti monster in the sky which is invisible, just because there's nothing to disprove this hypothesis.\n\nBad reasoning/thinking. I must believe (to be rational) that there is NOT a REAL spaghetti monster (and of course there IS obviously an *IMAGINARY* spaghetti monster in the sky!) until that NULL hypothesis is disproven by evidence.\n\n&gt;you said that the blue light isn't statistically significantly different than other visible light!\n\nNo, I didn't. I said that blue light isn't statistically significantly different than other visible light ** in terms of making you stay up later.**. You can't chop off the context; that's bad faith.\n\n&gt;it has a shorter wavelength and thus carries more energy than the other parts of the visible light\n\nYes. But I did specify at equal intensities. I constantly referred to intensity as the important factor, not wavelength. Obv a bunch more blue light carries a bunch more energy than less red light. However, I've not seen any evidence that, *within the visible spectrum*, there is a statistically significant effect **in terms of making you stay up later**, so I MUST (to remain rational) believe that there isn't.\n\n&gt;it has a very different effect on making us stay up late\n\nThere is no evidence with which to reject the corresponding null hypothesis to this positive claim, and rational people will continue believing this not to be true until presented with that evidence.\n\n&gt;either blocking them or lowering the amount of exposure is helpful\n\nSource needed. Are you claiming that blocking other visible spectrum wavelengths are statistically significantly different **in terms of making you stay up later** when you say \"helpful\"? If so, that's a positive claim, and it requires evidence to be believed by rational agents, which start of believing all correct null hypotheses, such as the null hypothesis that blue light isn't statistically significantly different **in terms of making you stay up later** from other visible spectrum colors.\n\n&gt;Even if we settle down to your approach of statistics(!) there shouldn't be a significant difference between UV-A and UV-C as well!\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"shouldn't\". And there's no \"approach\" to statistics implicit or explicit in my comment.\n\n&gt;Unless one of them will have a significant impact on you getting cancer and that's why we should care for the good ozone which blocks it!\n\nAgain, you're using \"should\" without defining it. Rational people don't *assume* a difference in skin cancer causation between two arbitrary wavelengths of light. There is probably sufficient evidence that these two bands of light cause statistically significantly different rates of skin cancer, or you wouldn't be bringing them up, but I don't yet know about UV-A and UV-C's causes on skin cancer. If you want to make that claim, cool. If you want to convince rational people of that claim, you need evidence. I'm not saying they're *not* different, just that rational people have to start out believing they're not different until evidence shoves them off that correct null belief. I'm more aware of how light causes skin cancer than how light keeps people awake later, which means I hypothesize that all ultraviolet lights might be capable of causing it, but that's not the null hypothesis. I don't know much about UV-A and UV-C, so I can't (rationally) predict that they're statistically significantly different until I know more about them. I don't even know which is higher- or lower-energy. If you used plain language, I might have to hypothesize the higher- energy one causes more skin cancer, but I couldn't say whether it'd be statistically significantly different, because I don't know what UV-A and UV-C are, and, even after I do, I don't know *enough* about the way light causes skin cancer to quantify the difference for a hypothesis, so I wouldn't be able to get off the null in terms of statistical significance even after knowing a quantitative description of what UV-A and UV-C are.\n\n&gt;by \"eye strain\" i mean any malfunctions of your eyes. \n\nNo, no lighting causes malfunction of the eyes.\n\n&gt;make our eyes lose some of its ability to sense the visible light spectrum or its ability to focus at other things, after a while?\n\nNo, there is nothing about looking at a dim screen, \"for a while\" that changes the ability to sense anything in our eyes. Our eyes' *abilities* and *function* are unaffected by normal lighting, \"for a while\". Now, if you look at CLOSE objects and don't get sufficient sun-like light, for a long while, while your eyes are developing, it seems quite likely that this causes your eyes to keep growing past the \"right\" shape and into the too-pointy nearsighted shape. You also secrete something after being in dark-enough environment for \"a while\" that aids in dark vision, but this doesn't change your eyes' abilities or function; it's just temporary, and a normal part of eye function/ability.",

I like it this way \ud83d\ude0d I guess your null hypothesis is believed by you, because you know little about lights and eye and brain functions.\n\nThough I think I'm not the one who has the responsibility of presenting an alternate hypothesis and it is better for the rational person to remain rational by not confirming to every and each null hypothesis that pops up in his mind by trying to dig deep and find better alternatives but it's alright! let me give you my alternate hypothesis:\n\n1. blue light certainly have a different wavelength which is more powerful than that of other lights in an LED, thus there's a difference between all the colors an LED emits. then the relative energy of LEDs light emissions shows that blue light's energy is way higher and intense than other colors and we already know that blue can penetrate more into the retina, hence its high energy and low filtering capability of our eyes for the blue. [here's a spectral distribution of typical daylight and LED light](https://eyesafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blue-light-spike-LED-emissions-graph.jpg.webp)\n2. when blue light enters our eyes, it stimulates cells containing [melanopsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanopsin)at the back of our retina. These cells signal to the brain that it is daytime. The brain responds by altering body functions to promote wakefulness- reducing melatonin secretion, constricting the pupils and increasing daytime hormones such as cortisol. So it doesn't **brake melatonin** as you said! In 2000, a new class of light-sensitive cells was discovered, called \u2018intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells\u2019  or [ipRGCs](https://www.blockbluelight.com.au/blogs/news/blue-light-wakes-us-up) for short. These cells have nothing to do with our vision. They contain the substance melanopsin that I talked about above. They absorb light only to regulate our sleep-wake pattern and other circadian rhythms. They are separate from rod and cone cells which help us see color and objects. That is why blue light wakes up even individuals who are blind! Melanopsin is most strongly affected by short wavelengths of around 480 to 550 nanometers. **This is the wavelengths of blue light and to some extent green light too**.(That is why any blue light blocking glasses that you wear must target the full frequency range of 400-550nm for them to be effective). this means that **blue is statistically significantly different than other visible light(about 1.98 times the energy) in terms of making you stay up later(hence the ipRGC).**\n\n&gt;Almost correct. The burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim. I can claim god doesn't exist, and it is in fact YOUR responsibility to prove it does.\n\nnot if i haven't said there's a (theistic)God. you can't just stumble on a random dude and say \"there ain't no God\" and assume it's their responsibility to prove you wrong. so if you come to me and outta the blue say that alien's doesn't exist without me claiming that they do, then i'd ask \"how come!?\"because it has nothing to do neither with negativity nor positivity, but to who claims a belief in order to communicate a message whether it's \\[+\\] or \\[-\\]. you claimed there's no difference between blue and other visible lights in terms of making us stay up late, and i asked \"are you sure!?\". I know that you are to some extent sure but how sure are you and how examined is that claim? it's your responsibility to prove what you claim.\n\nif you claim something and there's no evidence for it, then it's your responsibility to prove it and not mine to disprove it. otherwise one can simply believe that there's an invisible spaghetti monster in the sky, with the same analogy, just because there's nothing to disprove his null hypothesis!",

The null hypothesis regarding ISM is that it doesn't exist, just like for everything. The null hypothesis is that every causal relationship doesn't exist. Anyone claiming x doesn't cause y or a isn't (statistically significantly) different from b needs no evidence, as those are null hypotheses. Anyone claiming x causes y or a *is* different from b is making a positive claim, and has a burden of proof, to provide sufficient evidence with which to reject the corresponding null hypotheses.",

We're not discussing that.\n\n&gt;where is your evidence? \n\nFine. Blue light isn't 1.98x more energetic than other visible spectrum light. Red photon has about 1.91eV. Blue has about 2.75. 2.75/1.91=~1.44x. BUT that's the biggest range. The typical difference between blue and other visible spectrum light is less than that. Please define \"way\", or I get to just counterclaim it's \"not-way\" or \"tiny\". Not sure where you got 1.98.\n\n&gt;yeah, i provided the sources and linked back to them. so bring yours up. give us some evidence that it doesn't significantly \"effect\" the sleep cycle compared to other parts of the visible light.\n\nNo. You're missing the argument. I didn't quote you. I stated that what you said of blue light is also true of all visible light and some invisible light. That fact means that it's irrelevant whether or not blue light has an effect on sleep. The only matter in question is whether blue light is statistically significantly **different from** other visible spectrum light in terms of falling asleep later. I don't need a source to make a negative claim, that x is NOT different from Y. There is no burden of proof for such a claim. You, however, need evidence, not that blue light AFFECTS (not effects) falling sleep, but that blue light AFFECT falling asleep statistically significantly different from how other visible light AFFECTS falling asleep, because you're making the positive claim that they are significantly *different*. Your \"evidence\", which is actually just an explanation, not evidence, would be useful if you were trying to prove the positive claim that blue light does affect falling asleep later, and I was believing the negative claim that blue light doesn't affect falling asleep later, but that isn't the case.\n\n&gt;prove me that red light does the thing you claim. I bet you can't.\n\nI don't need to, because I'm not claiming that. I'm only claiming that **not-blue** light would also do what you claim blue light would do. That means, if **ANY** kind of not-blue light also does this, I'm right. Again, we're not discussing whether **red** light has the same effect as blue light. We can assume red light has a different effect from blue light, and that belief/fact is still compatible with the belief/fact that blue light is **NOT** statistically significantly **different from** other visible spectrum light in terms of falling asleep later.\n\n&gt;it has nothing to do neither with negativity nor positivity, but to who claims a belief in order to communicate a message whether it's [+] or [-].\n\nOk, you had your \"fun\", but you were wrong. Just stating something doesn't make it true. What I stated also happens to be true, whereas you stating the opposite isn't true, though you are free to state it. It's just that believing it or acting as if it's true (the same thing) is objectively wrong. Also, *who* claims something doesn't matter at all. What's true is true, regardless of who is claiming it.\n\n&gt;you can't just stumble on a random dude and say \"there ain't no God\" and assume it's their responsibility to prove you wrong.\n\nYes, you can. And it's *rational* to believe that there isn't God, until or unless some evidence disproves that null belief.\n\n&gt;you claimed there's no difference between blue and other visible lights in terms of making us stay up late\n\nTo state this more clearly, I didn't claim THAT there's no difference, I \"claimed\" (but not by the definition of making a claim that needs proof) that there ISN'T a difference, which is subtle, but important. One isn't \"making a claim\" in the strict sense when one claims a negative, that ISM/god/celestial teapot/unicorns **don't** exist, that x doesn't cause y, that a and b aren't different. I can't help you if you don't get this, because it's just part of rationality. You can never become correct if you believe the wrong null hypotheses by default, and you can never become correct if you believe that negative claims require evidence, because negative claims can't be proven; only positive claims can be proven, and they are proven by falsifying the corresponding null with evidence.\n\n&gt;BTW, you have never mentioned what do you \"exactly\" mean by \"negative/positive\" claims? it's good to explain it in details.\n\nI have, many times. A positive claim is claiming THAT something exists, that a causal relationship, or a difference between things exists, such as x causing y, or a being statistically significantly different from b, etc. A negative claim is the opposite of these. You don't need evidence to claim that anything doesn't exist, because you can't prove that something doesn't exist, you can only prove that things do exist, by finding evidence for their existences.\n\n&gt;think of it like someone comes to you and claims your beloved doesn't exist on the planet earth anymore and ever after. you shit yourself and are scared to death and ask what happened to them? then they go like \"come on dude! it was a negative claim. i have no responsibility to prove it\".\n\nHmmm. You're not rational. The person couldn't refer to \"my beloved\" without knowing who they are, so, if that were the case, I wouldn't \"shit myself\", I'd ask for proof that they knew and understood who \"my beloved\" is. Assuming they did know who \"my beloved\" is, then there's a different problem with this contrived story. They would be making the positive claim that \"my beloved\" had either left Earth or died, both of which require evidence, *because* they're positive claims. Useful example for illustrating why this is irrational and what is a positive/negative claim, though.\n\n&gt;i said \"if you claim something and there's no evidence for it, then it's your responsibility to prove it and not mine to disprove it.

The important thing is that a *rational* person *MUST* believe everything based on evidence, and *MUST* start with all null hypotheses as beliefs (this is for everything the person has no evidence about, until they get evidence). To be rational is to bind yourself to starting with correct beliefs and to **update** those beliefs in the face of evidence. This isn't a claim, it's just a true statement. I'm not claiming anything exists, any causal relationship, any difference between things. Just definitions and metaphysical true facts. I'm rational about a lot of things, including blue light blocking apps and glasses. I had to believe that there was no SS difference between blue light and other light in terms of falling asleep when I was \"born\" as a rational mind, and I have encountered no evidence against this null belief, so I must believe it and make the not-claim (or negative claim) that this difference doesn't exist. I also have to instantly change my mind the moment I'm presented with evidence that disproves this, just like I have to instantly change my mind the moment any null hypothesis is disproved by evidence. I have to NOT update my beliefs that \"my beloved\" has left Earth or died if the person is unreliable or doesn't know \"my beloved\", and I HAVE to update my beliefs if they're reliable and knew \"my beloved\", because that means they're evidence that a change has occurred. If they're reliable and also \"prank\" me, then I'd have to update my beliefs AGAIN after they said, \"it's just a joke\", because that'd be evidence again.",

It's stronger than just the null hypothesis, because I'm willingly exposing myself to information about blue light and sleep, and I *still* haven't come into contact with any evidence that blue light is statistically significantly different from other visible spectrum light colors in terms of making you stay up later.\n\nNull hypothesis: blue light blocking glasses/apps don't help you fall asleep faster (than not-blue-but-visible-spectrum blocking glasses/apps that block the same amount of light)\n\nBut I've investigated and used blue light blocking glasses and apps for like 10 years, so if there *were* evidence against the null, it's *more* likely that I'd have encountered it than if I simply had no information/exposure to the question, so I have to weight that absence of evidence a little more heavily than someone who just has no evidence but didn't expose themself to encountering that evidence, were it to exist.\n\nAs an analogy, a rational person who exists must not believe in God, because there is no evidence for God. But if a person had also prayed, and failed to find God, they have to believe in the null even more strongly. It needs to take even more evidence to push them off the null, now that they've encountered the absence of evidence in the very place you'd expect to find it, were it to exist.",

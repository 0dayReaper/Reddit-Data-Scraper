    "postText": "Why YSK: it could save your carrier from being stung\n\nLetter Carrier here. \n\nWe\u2019re almost to the month of May which means nice weather, hanging out outside, school closing for the summer, and the return of those dastardly devils: Yellowjackets and Wasps.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. But just in case you haven\u2019t, this time of the year wasps and Yellowjackets (especially Yellowjackets) like to make nests inside of mailboxes. In a lot of places this time of the year, it\u2019s just beginning to warm up outside, but it\u2019s still fairly cold at night. So mailboxes provide nice, easy shelter for them. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times, especially during this part of the year, where I\u2019ve opened up a box to see a little nest with 3-5 Yellowjackets just chillin. If I\u2019m really unlucky, they will have made their nest at the very back of the box so I wind up sticking my hand in not knowing they are there. We all know how temperamental these little douchebags are and merely existing in their presence is enough to piss them off. Last year alone I was stung 10 times on 10 separate occasions. \n\nGetting to my point. We\u2019ve found that they hate scented dryer sheets. If we encounter a box that is a problem for nests, we\u2019ll often put one in there and it does the trick.\n\nSo please, if you one day randomly see a dryer sheet at the back of your mailbox, just know that your carrier more than likely put it there to deter these Satanic creatures from building their home in it.\n\nEdit: there\u2019s been a lot of good questions in the comments and I\u2019m having a heck of a time replying to them so let me just add an edit.\n\n1. It really doesn\u2019t matter so much what brand you buy, if it\u2019s eco-friendly, or what scent it is. All that matters is that it is scented. The scent seems to be what deters them. So any scented dryer sheet should suffice!\n\n2. This should only be used as a *preventative measure.* I\u2019ve never tried when there\u2019s a huge nest so I have no idea if it would work. I just immediately leave a note on the customer\u2019s door letting them know they need to take care of the nest before I can resume delivering their mail. It would be best to get rid of the large nest and then put a dryer sheet in to keep them from coming back.\n\n3. As far as when to replace them, just check it periodically to see if the scent is still strong or if it has faded. The scent, once again, is what drives them away. So if the scent isn\u2019t as strong or it has completely faded, it\u2019s time to replace it.",

Another lady said her daughter had the same blue tape on her car in the same parking lot. I couldn't find a single police report or news article that confirms anything about this tactic being used by human traffickers. I did realize the car wash right next door to the grocery store uses blue painters tape to hold down your rear windshield wiper when you get your car washed.\n\nWhat's more likely? That human traffickers are risking being seen to mark a car with tape when they will have to follow the \"victim\" to kidnap them anyways (its not like it's a GPS tracker) .... Or that both girls went to the car wash next door, and some lazy employee forgot to take the tape off when the car was finished.",

If it says presorted standard toss it. Unless it has a service request thats basically what the po does with it. If it says first class, then toss that back. It can be forwarded to the person.

I just kept leaving it and putting the flag up, shed put it down and leave the mail.

These are for packages not requiring a signature. I signed up for electronic alerts from USPS, and received a notification of a failed delivery before 8am, well before she runs by by house (around 1pm). I promptly reported this with a screenshot and received an apology from the postmaster, claiming it was done in error.\n\nBut the tip of the iceberg is when last year, during covid, she flagged down my wife's 82 year old grandpa and made him come to her vehicle. She told him to tell us we had to move my kids' playhouse from its spot in the bottom of our driveway or she will not deliver any more packages. She said she couldn't back out of my driveway because of it. It had been there for several years without issue.\n\nAnyways, I take some pictures, email them to the postmaster. He comes out, talks to me and looks at my driveway and again apologizes. Tells me she will be delivering my packages.\n\nEver since then, on any day there is rain in the forecast, she leaves my mailbox door open. It's petty as can be, and kind of hilarious, but also just being a complete douchebag as normal.",

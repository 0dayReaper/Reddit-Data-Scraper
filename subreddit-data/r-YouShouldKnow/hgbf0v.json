    "postText": "Cats hunt down endangered birds and small mammals while they\u2019re outdoors, and have become one of the largest risk to these species due to an over abundance of outdoor domestic cats and feral cats. Please reconsider having an outdoor cat because they are putting many animals onto the endangered list.\n\nEdit to include because people have decided to put their personal feeling towards cats ahead of facts: the American Bird Conservancy has listed outdoor cats as the number one threat to bird species and they have caused about 63 extinctions of birds, mammals, and reptiles. Cats kill about 2.4 billion birds a year. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists cats as one of the worlds worst non-native invasive species.\n\nIf you want your cat to go outside, put it on a leash with a harness! That way you can monitor your cat and prevent it from hunting anything. Even if you don\u2019t see it happen, they can still kill while you\u2019re not watching them. A bell on their collar does not help very much to reduce their hunting effectiveness, as they learn to hunt around the bell. \n\nAlso: indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor cats! It keeps them from eating things they shouldn\u2019t, getting hit by cars, running away, or other things that put them in danger\n\nI love how a lot of people commenting are talking about a bunch of the things that humans do to damage the environment, as if my post is blaming all environmental issues on cats. Environmental issues are multifaceted and need to be addressed in a variety of ways to ensure proper remediation. One of these ways is to take proper precautions with your cats. I love cats! I\u2019ve had cats before and we ensured that they got lots of exercise and were taken outside while on harnesses or within a fenced yard that we can monitor them in and they can\u2019t get out of. You\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t take the same precautions with dogs, even though dogs are able to be trained much more effectively than cats are.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why people are thinking that my personal feelings are invading this post when I haven\u2019t posted anything about my personal feelings towards this issue. This is an important topic taught in environmental science classes because of the extreme negative impact cats have on the environment.",

I go to the cat and pet her, she purrs, smells me and throws her head on my hand. I was like sure why not. Later she leaves trough the window, while i was working on seting up my stuff. She comes back at night and meows at me like 'I'm hungry, feed me'. And that's how i got Krazy, my cat. She still does it to this day, leaves during the day and comes back whenever she sees me/car/lights turn on on my room. \n\nBtw my appartement is a attic on a german rural house, it's not high, and she knows her way.",

At least then it controls their population somewhat, so call!\n\nEDIT: I've been corrected. These programs require someone to care for and be responsible for the animal for a few days post surgery, and do require a small fee. The programs are, according to information below, not through \"animal control,\" but other city programs. Animal control does in fact euthanize the animals. Sorry, yall.",

One time our dogs got out and a neighbor called us to come pick them up. Standing in their backyard I saw my cat jump up on their fence and looked totally surprised and horrified to see me. The little boy that lived there shouted \u201cmom! The kitty is back! Do we have any more chicken??\u201d\n\nHe also once came home wearing a collar that said \u201cEllie\u201d on it.  We called the number on the tag and the people were terribly apologetic for accidentally adopting our cat. Funny thing was that they had chosen the name Ellie having decided he was a female, but were considering Elvis if they thought he was a male, which was his actual name.",

I'm going to copy/paste from another user here:\n\n&gt;The RSPB cites the Mammal Society for its cat predation claims.  Here's a link to that data: https://www.mammal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Domestic-Cat-Predation-on-Wildlife.pdf\n\n&gt;There are several limitations when it comes to studies like this.  First, the data is self-reported.  Many of the people surveyed were members of the Mammal Society so are interested in wildlife conservation - I would not be surprised if these wildlife enthusiasts either under-reported kills or took measures (such as bells/bibs) to curb their cat's killings.  \n\n&gt;Second, this number does not include feral cats or partially feral cat colonies, which is probably about 1 million cats (from a cursory google search, I can find a source if you want). It's a smaller percentage of total cats in the UK but a feral cat is undoubtedly catching more wildlife than a domestic cat.\n\n&gt;Third, domestic cats don't bring home all their kills; a researcher from the University of Georgia but cameras on cats and found that domestic cats brought home less than 25% of their kills (source: https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/outdoor-cats-are-prolific-killers-study-finds I can try to hunt down the actual paper if you want). Since the self-reported survey only tracks animals brought home and then found by the cat owner, multiplying that 27 million by four may actually be a low estimate.  And that's just birds, the UK has several threatened mammal and reptile species that are also killed in high numbers.",

We played with her every day, tons of toys, built her cat trees and places to run, eventually all she did was lie all die looking out the window. So we started letting her out, in the first month she brought us an insane number of dead birds and mice so we knew that wasn't going to work. So I did some research and eventually found these collars. I didn't buy one I just made one myself exactly like the design on the website. My cat looks like a big dumb dumb now but she hasn't brought us anything. So that's down from about 5 corpses and 1 live bird a week inside of our house for about 2 months (including one live bird she brought in 3 days in a row, yes the same live uninjured, very confused not) down to 0 in about 2 months. \n\nI definitely agree with the op, it isn't cool to automatically let your cats be outdoor with no research at all. But this collar is a good substitute. We are teaching her slowly to stay inside and we're hoping it'll stick by winter when she wouldn't want to be out anyways, but for the time being this seems to have quelled the daily corpse pile in my bed and kitty is still happy while she learns to enjoy life playing with humans instead of dead things.",

He likes to try and slip out the door when we're not looking, but if I take him outside enough on the leash it seems to satisfy his curiosity and he's fine staying inside the rest of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, my other cat has 0 interest in the very weird outdoors, and would much prefer that I NOT attempt to take him outside.\n\nEdit: [cat tax](https://imgur.com/gallery/vaSRkqG)",

Mine are indoor/outdoor (I live in a region with low biodiversity and very few birds, all they catch is some mice in my garage which i see as a more natural of pest control compared to the traps I\u2019d otherwise have to set) and they come back, pass out on my bed for 12 hours, then ask to be let out again to go lounge on a sunny bench in my neighbors garden. People constantly marvel at how calm they are. How would you be doing if you spent your whole life trapped inside, with your natural prey taunting you in the garden, and all you have to play with is a couple feathers on a string whenever your human feels like it?\n\nIndoor cats are fine IF you provide the necessary stimulation. I see a LOT more behavioral troubles in indoor cats than indoor/outdoor cats.",

But she doesnt understand that bed time is bed time. Maybe it was her schedule when she was outside but everynight at 2am she wants to run around and yowl.  I cant play with her much cuz I have work but trying to let her roam the rest of the house and socialize her with the adult cat we already have. I gave her a jingle ball toy but need to get some more stuff to play with\n\nI have 0 intention of letting her be an outdoor cat again, I live in the woods and have a mom racoon wander through my yard with baby racoons every night, have seen a fox in my yard a few times in the past month, bears, heard owls and coyotes. I wouldnt trust a cat to come inside before the nocturnal predators come out. Last thing I want is to see my cat be torn apart by racoons",

Feral cat is essentially a wild animal with very little to none human contact, you can turn feral cat into a pet only at a young age and with a lot of work. Stray cat is a cat that is accustomed to humans, while it may be shy and skittish most of these can be turned into pets with little to quite a bit of work, depending on individual cat. I managed to adopt a feral cat only because she chose my other cat as her bff and slowly grew more fond of me through play and food also she was cca 3 months old, normal strays are usually one can of wet catfood away from being super friendly.",

We have feral cats around our community and they are awful but my cat was a stray that hung out in the bushes around my door - all it took was me walking outside and acknowledging her and she decided I was hers and literally walked into my house. She\u2019s the best, most tolerant, cat I\u2019ve ever met. Doesn\u2019t give a shit about my dogs, and is amazing to my 3 year old which is important. BUT I am training her to not go outside past our wall still, it\u2019s been two years and she goes potty in the backyard (which I prefer) and only goes over the wall to sit like a loaf of bread on the other side instead of wandering and hunting.",

Otherwise you're exposing them to risks like cars, hawks, other cats with a bone to pick, diseases they wouldn't pick up inside, the list goes on.\n\nAnd I don't care if your culture just sees it as the way it's always been done. I've heard that from a Polish friend of mine whose outdoor-only kitten was hit by a car, then the family immediately went and replaced her with another kitten they kept outside too. If you just do what everyone else does solely because everyone else does it, how will anything change?",

Keeping your cats inside helps them live longer, healthier lives away from predators, parasites, and cars, and it will also save your local ecosystem.",

The reason for this is because our city has a policy that friendly \"community cats\" be caught, neutered, and re-released. When we found her she was an outdoor cat, it looked like she had been released recently because her cut ear was still fresh. (This is a method of marking the cats who have been designated as community cats) The reason the shelter released the cat instead of having her adopted was because apparently having a cat patrol the area scares away other cats and discourages them from hunting the area. We adopted her because when we found her it was winter and it looked like she had been bitten and it got infected. I still think it would be better if she was an indoor cat but I'm not sure if that's allowed?\n\n[Also here's a picture](https://preview.redd.it/5us5rzrzjqp41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91948568f10625b128e5cfca7ad278cd9fc2e3e7)",

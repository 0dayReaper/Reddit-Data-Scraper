    "postText": "Why YSK? So, imagine you're going out to eat with your buds. Before you dig into those fries, drink a big glass of water. It'll help you not stuff your face and feel way less bloated later. And if you're trying to curb those snack cravings, drink water before reaching for those chips. You might think you're super hungry, but after drinking water, you'll realize you were just thirsty or bored. Plus, if you're like me and trying to shed some pounds, this trick can be super helpful in the long run. So don't forget to hydrate before you eat y'all!",

They either stop listening to the insulin coming from the Pancreas or requires more insulin to open and eat up some sugars that they need to deliver to the Liver in order to turn into usable energy for the body.\n\nIt's a good thing to keep insulin spikes low or at a minimum so you don\\`t fill up all your cells at the same time. Unless your doing a workout and can burn them up quickly or you are replenishing your cells after an activity.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar reduces the sugar spike from the foods you eat, therefore also reducing the insulin spike reaction. It's kind of like warming up your hands with a nice soft warm cup of hot chocolate vs putting your hands in the cup of hot chocolate.\n\nOnce your insulin is low enough, your liver gets the heads up to burn some stored energy. (fats)\n\nToo much blood sugar in your body can severely damage your organs, cause inflammation which is your body swelling up and constructing blood flow efficiently,. which can lead to a GG. (ded)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy eating less, you also lessen the amount of insulin in the body do that your liver gets a heads up to burn fats or extra weight.",

When you put something in your stomach enough to stretch it, even water, that grelin  subsides usually after about twenty minutes.  Interestingly if you sleep poorly then grelin and leptin get really disregulated and grelin is increased dramatically causing us to crave even more. So drink water and also sleep well to curb appetite.  After some time the brain and body will only raise grelin when you normally eat. So if you eat five times a day you will spike grelin five times a day. If you eat once every day at noon then you will eventually only get hungry an hour or so before noon once a day.",

Again water will definitely flush out the toxins or microbes in the body but excessive amount of water before food would only create a pressure on the nephrons..

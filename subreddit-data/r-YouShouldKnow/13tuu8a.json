    "postText": "Why YSK: Awns can get stuck in your pets throat, nose, ear or paws. If you notice some of these symptoms you should go to the vet.\n\nThroat/Lung: Your pet will cough and gag. If it\u2019s in the throat it might get better after some soft food, but if it doesn\u2019t don\u2019t hesitate! If you notice that your pet isn\u2019t breathing the right way you should go asap. \n\nNose: Your pet will sneeze uncontrollably. \n\nEar: Your pet will shake its head. You might notice that your pet will lean it\u2019s head to one side or the other.\n\nPaws: Your pet could hobble. It could lick or chew on his paws.\n\n\nThese things are nasty, they have small barbed hooks and they can wander deeper inside and get stuck inside the skin, throat or lung.\n\nDon\u2019t let your pet inside Grainfields or let them chew on grass that Hase these Awns.",

Our 10 week old puppy swallowed/inhaled one of these things. Thankfully he could breathe normally but he kept gagging and coughing so we went to the vet. One of the little strings of one awn got stuck like a splinter on its larynx right above its trachea. They could remove it but had to narcotise him. We had to pay roughly 900\u20ac, could have been up to 1400\u20ac but thankfully our little buddy is alright again.",

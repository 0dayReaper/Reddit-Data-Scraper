In addition to this, after you set this up, you're going to want to call your local office and tell them you have this service and have them put a JAR card in your case slot so that the carrier and any sub on the route is aware. \n\nAlso, if you just want the coupons, ask your carrier. Most routes end up with 20+ undeliverable fliers. If you ask, they might just give you a half dozen coupon pages, especially if you have a good report with them.\n\nCarriers will bend over backwards for nice customers and it is very rare for managers to go out of their way to stop over the top customer service, as long as it isn't explicitly against company policy.",

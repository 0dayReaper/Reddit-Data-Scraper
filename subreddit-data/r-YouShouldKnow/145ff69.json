    "postText": "Why YSK:  Palytoxin is a highly dangerous, yet little known toxin. There is no cure, and can be found all over the tropics and potentially in home aquariums.\n\nMostly found in coral in the palythoa family. An extremely common beginner coral for hobbyist, it can also be found in other marine life like dinoflagellates. The water can poison you, and it's is also extremely easy to get the toxin in the air.\n\nWhile poisoning are rare, even for hobbyist. Many people are unaware of this toxin, even when most saltwater store may have coral that can contain this toxin. It's is rarely mentioned by\nsellers. Which isn't much different than selling a venomous snake without informing the future owner that it is in fact, venomous.\n\nWhile poisoning are rare, and completely\navoidable with some basic knowledge. Many people have no idea they have potential one of the most toxic substances in the world in their marine fish tank.  Many doctors would have no experience with this toxin and would not know without being informed about potential exposure.",

So new reef keepers will aquire a piece of live rock and do the same thing thinking they're doing what's best for the aquarium, but actually it can be really dangerous. If there's a paly or a zoa on the rock the palytoxin will be in the air and poison people/pets that live in the house. For marine stuff never boil anything before putting it in your aquarium. \n\nAnother way is when fragging palys/zoas you have to be careful about inhalation and if there's any open wounds on your hands. \n\nGenerally just messing around the tank and rescaping isn't going to release enough palytoxin to be harmful but there's really long gloves you can wear just to be extra safe.",

It doesn't always work...\n\nMost reef keepers never experience any issues with palytoxins, indeed, many are even unaware of how dangerous they can be (be warned if you have a colony of \"Planet Earth\" palys! They're the worst!) until they do something to make an aerosol of the toxin (vigorous scrubbing/boiling) and fill their homes with toxic fumes. Sadly, when this happens, it is usually family pets who get a lethal dose before their mistake is realised.\n\nTo stay safe, limit contact with any zoa/paly, wear gloves and glasses if you need to break rocks with those corals on them, wash your hands after touching them and for the love of all that is holy don't touch your eyes or other \"soft tissue\" (use your imagination).\n\nAnd this is why I always say; never mess with a reefkeeper, they don't check for palytoxins during autopsies!!",

Only a few of the myriad types of these corals actually have it in the concentrations necessary to hurt people. Those corals tend to be less popular in the hobby. Most zoanthids traded are aquacultured. They reproduce like crazy in captivity so collecting wild ones is not as common as with other corals. The wild ones are where you\u2019re more likely to find higher concentrations of palytoxin. The wild ones also tend to be more drab, so less appealing for collection. \n\nWith that said, if you have them in your tank, sticking your hand in with an open wound and poking the coral isn\u2019t a good idea. You also don\u2019t want to boil the coral (not sure why you\u2019d want to?) because that would aerosolize the toxin. There was also a case where supposedly the tank just aerosolized the toxin on its own\u2026probably due to a crazy amount of turbulent water movement. \n\nMost cases of palytoxin poisoning result in severe flu-like symptoms. \n\nTl/dr most people who keep these corals will never come into contact with a variety that is dangerous but to be on the safe side use common sense when handling them and follow basic \u201cthis stuff can be toxic\u201d protocols.\n\nEdited to add:\nThere are on average about 12 cases of palytoxin poisoning per year in the US from all sources. The most common source\u2026? Contaminated seafood. Not reef aquariums.",

Half the people aquaculturing these coral have know idea what species they have.  \n\nAnd unfortunately most of these boring zoa and palys are exactly the the type of coral someone new to the hobby would get.  They are plentiful, and cheap.  They are the ones most likely to know nothing about this.  Meanwhile someone with experience knows the basic safety protocols that should be followed when dealing with marine tanks.\n\nThe rest of your post is dead on though.  I would however wager that it\u2019s more common in tanks than you think.  A happy coral containing palytoxin is unlikely to release it into the water.  A lot of people also run carbon, which should remove the toxin.",

Claiming that they only release when stressed and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t more poisonings is\u2026silly. Zoas get stressed ALL THE TIME. They are constantly being walked on, picked at, and fighting off algae. They are placed close to other coral. All those things stress them. Hell, even incorrect flow or water parameters will piss them off. \n\nConsidering their popularity and status as a \u201cstarter\u201d coral there should be a hell of a lot more than a handful of poisonings per year (in the US) if they were as toxic as you\u2019re claiming.

            "comment": "My student grows coral as a side gig and takes care of peoples tanks, one day he went to to a clients tank who had bought this type of coral \u201cbecause it was pretty\u201d without telling my student, well, he touched it and my student didn\u2019t register it right away, he just so happened to have a cut on his finger, he jumped out of the tank and yelled at the client, then he grabbed a chuck of the coral to bring with him to the hospital , I guess they can identify what it was.  there technically isn\u2019t a cure, there are measures that can be taken that can reverse the effects of acted upon fast enough, he was given several injections and was on fluids. It lasted just under 2 days, Now had he gotten a bunch of it in a larger open wound, it would be fatal. But many species of palythoa have a mild toxin, which is thankfully one of the ones he came into contact with. I didn\u2019t know this was a thing until he came to class one day and told the story, sent me down a rabbit hole. He said As soon as you touch it, it\u2019s like a thin mucus coating, slightly stings on cuts. In a way, it feels like a mild form of putting hydrogen peroxide on a cut. And the symptoms are like a very bad flu.",

            "comment": "Yep, very true.  I have both zoanthids and palythoas in my reef tank and wear gloves whenever I handle them. What I\u2019ve always read is that there is a higher risk when disturbing them, like having to spit the colony during fragging or when changing the aquascape.  If fragging out of the tank, I know protective eyewear is also recommended.  Hobbyists have posted stories of their trips to the hospital due to poisoning.  Scary stuff, but they are gorgeous in a tank.",

I accidentally brushed my arm against an extra large carpet anemone and instantly knew something wasn\u2019t right. The local emergency room said it caused a pancreatitis from the amount of neurotoxin in my blood. It was so rare, I\u2019m not even positive that it caused it, but since they linked the sting/neurotoxin, and the pain/huge swollen rash, their insurance paid for everything.",

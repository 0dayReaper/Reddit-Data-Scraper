    "postText": "Holding the SMS button that appears allows you to schedule the message for whenever. Once sent it can still be adjusted to update the text, send now, or reschedule.\n\nI just discovered this after using 3rd party tools to do the same thing often not as well. I'm not sure if this works on iPhone but it should work on all Android devices if you use the Google Messages app from the Play Store.\n\n[Example Album](https://www.imgur.com/a/DVbsdJM)\n\n**Why YSK:** It means for people who already use a scheduled you don't need extra apps which bog down performance. Also, if you are a more casual user who rarely uses scheduling it's nice to know you can do it right there quickly and easily.",

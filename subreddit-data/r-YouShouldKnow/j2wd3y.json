    "postText": "Why YSK: I've heard a lot of stories from people who give up on working out because they feel weak, or they go for a month but don't look or feel any different. They get embarrassed because they feel weaker than they expected. Well, you aren't, your brain is just lazy!\n\nI had never heard this before I forced myself to take things seriously and got a trainer a couple years ago after failing to make progress on my own and feeling terrible. This was what they told me and I wanted to share: Your body has likely never had to fire a single dedicated muscle to move something. Ever. You have almost always been able to \"cheat\" moving something by using your core strength, keeping your arms in close and \"putting your back into it\". You're making up for your weaker muscles by giving them mechanical advantages in every way you can. So your brain has literally no idea *how* to contract your bicep(for example) by itself and wants to cheat. If you're using a machine, you might even catch yourself trying to get under the weight, even though logically you know it won't help. That's your brain fighting back against what is basically just seen as a massive waste of effort and an inefficient way to move something. You are literally fighting yourself.\n\nYour first few weeks, if not your first couple *months* depending on frequency can feel embarrassing because you don't think you're doing it right, or it doesn't feel right, or you feel like you're getting nowhere. Your brain has to literally build the ability to focus and fire a muscle properly, and that takes time, and it's frustrating. As we age, it hates building new neural pathways even more, and it fights against your conscious efforts. It can be done, though!\n\nThe only way forward is to do the motion, with a comfortable weight, over and over until it gets there. This can't be rushed, it just takes time and consistent form and effort. You'll notice when it does, because things will start to feel better. You might have gained little to no muscle mass but you'll be able to move a little more weight. That can be confusing, but it's just your soggy meat-hunk finally getting the picture. Machines are actually great for this because in most cases you can't cheat the motion, which would do you no good at all.\n\nIf you feel embarrassed because you think you look weak, or foolish in a room full of people who aren't struggling, just remember that they went through the same thing once. They're probably mentally supporting you because they know getting started sucks. I felt terrible and out of place for a long time, but then suddenly you don't.\n\nSo don't give up on working out. Don't give up on your body. Don't feel embarrassed because you're struggling to literally curl 5 pounds(me). Keep at it, and understand that your brain is just a stubborn bit of hardware that has to be trained and changed with you. Put that work in. Plus, then you can do the Terry Crews thing where you bounce your pecs around.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: For the curious or concerned here's an [interesting read about this](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Fulltext/2003/04000/Training_Induced_Changes_in_Neural_Function.2.aspx).   \nTL;DR:  \"Resistance training elicits adaptive changes in the nervous system as well as in the morphology of the trained muscles (Fig. 6).  In particular, neural adaptation mechanisms are important for the  increases in maximal eccentric strength and rate of force development  observed with training.\"  \n\n\nand to clarify, like I said above this  was some early advice from my long-time personal trainer, who is \\*FAR\\* more qualified than I will ever be, and this is a post to share some insight into a common struggle.  \n",

The process apparently takes time to get going if it isn't used to it so you hit a period of basically running on Empty. After doing it a bunch, the changeover happens a lot more smoothly and you don't get the wall.   \n\n\nThat's what we were always told, at least. Dunno if its the same type of brain change, or like, a chemical one with whatever process handles fat burning. Would be fun to read more into.   \n(I'm not a doctor though, so yeah don't just assume more energy is around the corner and accidentally end up in the hospital...)",

I've never had a panic attack but my body felt like it just couldn't handle it, like I was headed there. It was largely mental, though. I learned to relax my shoulders and exhale to try to calm myself down. My brain just had to get used to my body doing this and realize I *could* breathe, if I relaxed a little.\n\nSo maybe it's a little different than what you were describing with lifting, but it definitely reminded me of my experience.",

Due to this your body has to find an alternative source of energy. It will then begin to pull from your fat stores, breaking them back down into glucose.\n\n ATP, ADP, etc. It's all cellular respiration.\n\nIIRC the *high* associated with pushing through the wall is basically your brain picking back up its normal function.\n\nYour body is constantly burning a carb/fat mixture all day, everyday. The ratio changes though based upon intensity and your body's instantaneous needs. You'll burn more fat with slow, steady state running vs a few wind sprints.\n\nWhen you blow through your energy reserves\u2014 glycogen\u2014 your brain starts to try and shut things down. It's a survival mechanism. It wants you to stop and conserve energy. This leads to the mental block you'll experience at times, the negative thoughts that come with the onset of *the wall*. \n\nAs you push through the wall and your body finally says \"FINE I'll find the energy elsewhere.\" It begins to convert fat into useable energy, and the brain's function revs back up to normal. This change is what leads to the \"high\".\n\n*The Wall* can hit anyone at different times, and be very inconsistent as well. Some people it may never hit.",

I'd like to add some cool facts:\n\nIn an average man, the body stores 600 kcal in glycogen sores, in the cells (mainly liver and muscle), and 100 000 kcal in fat stores (adipose tissue). It is estimated that storing energy as fat is 6 times more efficient than as glycogen. Obviously fat is a much better source of energy, but it has a problem: breaking down, transporting and oxidising fats for energy is a very slow process compared to glycogen.  So for explosive exercise, first you use your glycogen stores, and by the time they are depleted you will have had time to start mobilising the fat. (I'm guessing this is also why warming up before exercise is a good idea?)",

As a teenage dude that was weak as hell. But I stuck with it and eventually made my way past a plate. Then plateaued again around 185. And then finally broke that and now I'm at 225 for reps. Took me a few years and I was ready to give up at some points but really you just gotta stick with it and it'll happen eventually",

Went from an obese anti-social kid who smoked weed and ate and watched Netflix all day every day to an overweight slightly more social kid who doesn't smoke and eats less caloriclh dense food and exercise an hour or two a day. It's not rocket science but it wasn't easy to adjust. But now that I'm here I'm here for good.\n\nEdit: also went from barely passing Jr year to straight A's this year sofar.

OP might be scaring off some people just a little, a month should be enough time to start seeing some real progress imo.\n\nmy friend started lifting with us a *month and a half* ago. he was and still is a die hard long distance runner and always thought weightlifting was about ego and vanity. that he isn't a complete novice to exercise might exclude him from OP's point aimed at total beginners in fitness, but from my own experiences and observations i think a lot of people will see notable progress in a month.\n\nmy boy is now hooked and making crazy progress. he has gone from not even been able to lift an empty bar to multiple sets of: bench pressing 5x30kg*, deadlifting 5x50kg, squatting 5x40 kg, pressing 5x25kg. has gone from 0 pull ups to 3. still not massive weights and form can be a little shaky in later sets but he is adding more weight to all lifts every other session and looking more confident during lifts every time. can't wait to see what he will be like by the time of his wedding next summer. he will tell you himself he was wildly mistaken with his assumptions about both lifting itself and the kind of stereotypes of people who lift.\n\nif you're reading this, start today! do progressive callisthenics at home if nothing else but don't be afraid of the gym, first week is awkward, after that, first 6 months is all win win win. youtube is your friend.",

You can start with one of the bigger ones that takes ~100 pounds off your weight, and then when you can do, say, 3 sets of 10, switch to a smaller band that makes them a little harder, and repeat the process. Similarly, you can do \u201cnegatives\u201d without a band if you have enough strength, but not enough to do full pullups. So you have a chair or step stool or something and you use that to bring yourself to the top of the rep, then slowly lower yourself in a controlled manner to the bottom of the rep, then repeat the process. The lifting yourself up is harder, but slowly lowering yourself is still good, and can help get you used to handling your own body weight, so this is a good way to get used to handling your own body weight.\n\nSimilarly, if you can\u2019t do enough normal pushups, start on your knees. When you can do enough of them, switch to pushing up with your knees down, then lift them off the ground and lower yourself down with normal push-up form, then put your knees back down to press back up.

This process allows you to  efficiently target your peak and challenge it. \n\nWeight training also targets specific repetition ranges. For example, a common program may take 10 repetitions, 1 minute break between, for 3 sets. This rep range is believed to maximize muscle growth when you train to failure. \n\nIt's way harder to target a specific rep range using body weight exercises. \n\nFinally it's really hard to do back exercises using body weight only. You will absolutely need to balance chest with back.\n\nI would not recommend whatever OP has suggested... The typical strategy is to start at a weight lower than you max and work your way up to your limit, and then past your limit. Weight lifting is like slowly chiseling a rock. You're only adding 5 lbs a week, but by the end of the month that's 20 lbs gain, if you can keep that up! For example I started with a 90 lb bench press to 135 lb. 95 lb squat to a 200 lb squat, by slowing adding weight every session. When you fail a set, repeat the weight the next session. When you succeed, add another tiny weight.",

This could be due to better recruiting of motor neurons as well as reduced golgi tendon reflex. The motor neurons are recruited in a better way so that you can lift more weight. The golgi tendon bodies are a set of reflexes that react to large stress loads that will trigger a reflex for your antagonistic muscles to fire to cause you to not put excessive force on your muscles that you are using. With repeated weight lifting your body gets better at getting bigger and faster muscle cells to fire quicker, as well as get your body to accept putting excessive stress into your joints.",

            "comment": "You're leaving out a lot of info here. \n\nHere's what's happening with your body. First of all, if you haven't been working out, jogging or anything like that, your body doesn't have the dedicated blood vessel infrastructure to properly supply your muscles with oxygen, nutrients, and clean up potential (lactic acid build up).\n\nYour body is an efficient machine, and so if it isn't using things like your muscles, it won't build or use those blood vessels. It'll pull them back as it would be a waste of energy. \n\nSo your getting tired because your body is demanding more than it can currently do ***at this moment***. But something magical happens. As you continue to work out over the weeks and months, your body starts to get into building mode. It sees that it needs more \"roads\" and so it'll start building more blood vessel locations throughout the muscles that you've been working on. \n\nThose muscles that are being worked are also being damaged, and so your body goes in and starts to repair them. And gosh, while your body is there, it might as well add more muscle to the location to make the tasks its been doing easier to manage. \n\nThis can make you tired, because you're spending more energy than you're used to, and your body is doing more work than it is used to doing. You're feeling fatigue. \n\nThere's another thing that will happen, depending on how hard you hit the weights. This usually happens if you haven't done any kind of weight lifting or jogging in a long time, but start up again. \n\nI don't know what the terminology is, but your body will get a next day \"shaky leg / arm\" feeling after your first work out (if it's been a long time). You'll feel a little wobbly in the legs and body (depending on what you targeted). Brace yourself, because the next day or two after the \"wobbly day\" will be very painful. Essentially, your body was put under a lot of stress, and this is your body recovering. You'll feel sore and stiff because you've likely caused a good bit of \"microdamage\" to your body's structure. This is rather normal and will not persist (or should not persist) if you keep working out, but give yourself a couple of days break before continuing. Listen to your body. \n\nMaybe the point is lost on me, but its not your brain feeling lazy, and it's not really you feeling lazy. It's your body letting you know that it feels tired and wants you to stop. Everyone has limits and you can usually push your limits, but more importantly, you need to make sure you listen to your body. \n\nApproaching exercise with the mindset of \"my brain is lazier than my muscles and doesn't want to change\" is not a good mindset to have for someone that is a novice with exercising / weight lifting. \n\nDo your homework. Learn how to do lifts properly. Form over reps, etc, etc.",

Technique, consistency, effort, and focus are skills you need to learn before your muscles will build strength. During this beginning process, you're going to feel tired and weak as you push yourself and learn. \n\nIf you've never exercised before, then this is entirely new territory. It's a bit scary and you're going to make mistakes. But it's still part of the process and literally every successful athlete or gym goer you see has been through it. \n\nIf you have exercised before, then this part will go a bit faster but it still happens. You have to remember and practice putting effort into the lift, or running at the right speed. You still have to spend time getting the technique correct. \n\nSo don't feel bad when you spend a month in the gym without any gains. That month was important and required, and you will see the reward as you continue.",

Understanding proper movements, what happens when you use grip variations or alternative exercises, how to avoid injury, etc, really helped me start making serious progress. It\u2019s been about 6 years now for me, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where I can keep track of weeks worth of workouts in my head with all sorts of different exercise plans to keep my body surprised. Everything plays a role. You don\u2019t have to commit to any one style of working out, you can mix in ballistic plyometrics, powerlifting, calisthenics, normal strength training movements, cardio, functional exercises, kettlebells, whatever you want to keep it interesting. Really take the time to understand what each exercise does and what it\u2019s benefits are and what muscle groups are worked. Understand the difference between strength, speed strength, and power. Once you have enough knowledge it becomes second nature to plan ahead and stick to it.\n\nAlso, after that beginning phase you there\u2019s a phrase affectionate referred to as \u2018noob gains\u2019, where you just start making crazy fast progress.

It's so important for beginners to learn the proper movement as it's easier to learn the movement and engrain it into the nervous system than it is to re learn a pattern you have been executing incorrectly for months or years. \n\nStrength is largely a skill and not a trait for example, you could be a beast at dead lifts but struggle to do a pull up because the pattern and intra muscular coordination has been developed specifically for the dead lift for those muscles to work together and produce force.

Learned this the hard way.\n\n2 a good way to acclimate is to do the movement with high frequency (think daily), but NOT heavy or to failure.  Training your brain to the movements will make noticeable strength gains (squat every day added 75lbs to my back squat and 100 to my front squat in just 3 months because my body learned to properly recruit muscle for the movement....also it was thanksgiving to christmas and i ate EVERYTHING).  Also, yes, there are people who will disagree, and it isn't for everyone (depending on time and availability, it might literally be impossible).  If not lifting, this principle also works amazingly with bodyweight exercise (do a pullup each time you walk through a certain doorway, or five pushups, etx.  Not enough to be taxing, just enough to do the movement)\n\n3.  If you want to get strong, ask a powerlifter for help.  They are generally some of the most friendly and helpful people in a gym.  Hell, even in competition, they will give you tips and help you out.  (This is a generalization, as I realize some people are just naturally dicks, but in general, powerlifter types seem to want to see everyone get strong and improve).\n\n\nJust my thoughts after the past 15 years or so.",

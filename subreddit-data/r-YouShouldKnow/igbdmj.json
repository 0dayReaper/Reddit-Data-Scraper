These heroes were thrown away or put down instead of honored. President Clinton passed \u201cRobby\u2019s Law\u201d in 2000 which allows handlers and their families first dibs at adopting military animals at the end of their useful service. The dogs are next offered to law enforcement, then adoptive families. Organizations like Saveavet.org place these retired heroes with suitable families and ensure they are given the honorable discharge they deserve. There is currently a waiting lists of civilians who want to give these veterans a loving home in which to retire. The wait is up to 12-18 months as of this post.\n\nMilitary working dogs usually hold a higher rank than their handler. This is to prevent the handler from mistreating their dog and is usually a sign of respect. Most Military working dogs hold the rank of an Non-Commissioned officer. After their service every measure is taken to ensure that they are trained to get acclimated to civilian life. MWD's are usually German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois and Labrador's to name a few.\n\nThere are about 2500 dogs in active service today and about 700 deployed overseas.\n\nEDIT: Repost because I'm not allowed to include websites",

Everything seemed to scare her at first and it took Mocha nearly a year to understand that she had a new home and family. She escaped several times to find her previous handler so my dad had to install grates under our fencing so she couldn\u2019t dig a hole underneath. \n\nRealizing she might be too much for us to handle, my dad asked if we wanted to give her up. Naturally we said no because we were kids and wanted a dog so bad. Though she had problems adjusting to civilian life, she developed a strong bond with my younger brother and followed him everywhere. \n\nShe also slept at the foot of his bed every night. Even when I wanted her to sleep with me, she would wait until I fell asleep then return to my brother\u2019s room. At first I was jealous but my brother suffered from asthma so at the first sign of an attack she would bark to alert everyone. Thanks to her, my dad was able to rush my brother to the hospital several times when he had severe attacks his inhaler couldn\u2019t remedy. \n\nShe also fought off a coyote that managed to climb a fence and get to my dad\u2019s homing pigeons. Mocha figured out how to push open a window and knock out the screen. Though she injured her paw during process, her strong sense of duty caused her to fight the intruder and scare off another coyote. Fortunately she survived and ended up living to the ripe old age of twelve. \n\nR.I.P. Mocha \u2764\ufe0f",

It sounds like the phenomenon is thought to be the mechanism that the birds use to detect the earth's magnetic field. It's not so much that the pairs are entangled (which they are) but that they have a magnetic moment. Under certain circumstances (when excited by light?) the pairs will align with the earth's magnetic field and the birds sense this, effectively \"seeing\" the magnetic field. Pretty cool, thanks for sharing!\n\nAlso, non AMP link:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/09/why-dont-birds-get-lost-they-may-have-mastered-quantum-mechanics/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/09/why-dont-birds-get-lost-they-may-have-mastered-quantum-mechanics/)",

When I was a kid he used to recruit me to be a practice missing person for training exercises because apparently the unique, signature scent (this is different than BO) on children isn't as strong and is more challenging for dogs to track. We'd get to a remote practice location, separate from the dogs and their handlers, and someone would walk me out some path to a spot where'd I'd wait to be found by however many dogs were part of the exercise. The search areas were usually pretty big, on the order of maybe up to a mile radius, and I'd hide in the woods or under a bridge and such, so it was hours of hiding but I was always really excited to do these because as a kid I got to see a bunch of very intelligent, life saving good boys each time.",

Same goes for hiding accidents, residents in your household, etc. I totally agree insurance companies are overdramatic with their rules and rates, but handing them money for coverage you know is invalid is not a great way to stick it to em. Its actually their dream.\n\nI had a friend of mine date a guy with 2 pits. They moved in together and lied on their application for their apartment and for their insurance to avoid the breed ban struggle. Unfortunately one of their dogs snapped one day and basically ripped a neighbors face off. Absolutely zero coverage from their insurance because they lied. They got evicted and had to put the dog down. It was very expensive and heartbreaking for them.",

Can't expect them to insure something (in this case, a dog) they know nothing about. People always get annoyed with me asking questions and accuse me of being nosy, but realistically you can't expect the insurance company to not question what they're insuring and just agree to hand you a check on your word if something happens. They go over the top with the questions at some places, but I'd suggest shopping other companies and being honest before I'd suggest withholding information. Cover your ass, not theirs!",

Looking at other comments it seems that the dogs might serve under more than one handler due to timing of service, so that might have been why they didn't get to be the one to keep the dog. If the dog has two or more handlers then obviously only one can take the dog home. If that is the case then it is still sad, but unavoidable and the dog still goes with one of its partners.",

She was the most well behaved, non barking, perfect, sweetest dog. We had to put her down a month ago, but CPL Breezy will always have a special place in the hearts of our entire family. Also, fun TIL for some people, but a military dog is always one rank above their handler. This is in order to prevent abuse.

Every one up for adoption has been thoroughly screened by the kennelmaster, servicing veterinarian, and 341st MWDTS.  Not all retiring MWD's are offered out for adoption because some are just nuts.  Most MWD's have had multiple handlers over their service life.  The majority are dual-certified - trained to detect either drugs or explosives, as well as patrol trained (locating intruders and attack/hold).  If you wanna do \"role-play night\" with the SO, be careful with the dog around, they protect their handler.  Most of the dogs are retired due to age or medical condition(s), you are solely responsible for their care.  You will be required to meet certain housing standards, namely a tall fence.  Loud noises may set the dog off, as may \"sneaky' behavior, they are trained to react to gunfire as well as detect intruders, so you need to have them under control at all times.  The dogs live their lives in a kennel facility when not on duty, so a home life will be new to them.  I've never seen a rank on any of my dogs records, but heard that rumor while I was on active duty too.  They are dogs, they each have quirks and issues, though likely less than the 'average' redditor.  Some of the dogs are hard enough to handle prior to retirement, so euthanasia is the only real option if they cannot work as a training aid at Lackland; they will not be adopted out as the neighborhood would end up as a big pile of ground meat.  \n  \nIf you do want to adopt your own Landshark, please apply *after* you research the breeds, training, and process someplace other than reddit.  These are generally awesome dogs that have earned a *good* home.\n   \n  \n~Former MWD handler.\n\nA quick add-on here: *Most* of the dogs used by the military are police dogs.  Also, John Wick 3 - Those *are* Belgian Malinois, which is a favorite of the U.S. Military.  We don't jump them *that* high though.",

My family has raised a military dog for about a year now and tomorrow he goes in for his final test to see if he\u2019s suitable to be a military dog. In the past the dogs who failed would be put down if the foster family didn\u2019t want to keep them but now they are up for adoption if they fail and the foster family decide to not keep them. Them failing the test doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a bad dog, it just means that the dog doesn\u2019t have the instincts or the health that the military needs them to have.\n\n\nSide note - if you\u2019re like me and love training dogs in your spare time and learning new things about them, raising a military dog is awesome and you get to learn so much! It takes a lot of time and effort though and is definitely not suitable for everyone.",

She tried to adopt Lizzy but because she has seen a professional for PTSD they took her off the list and told her no. \n\nA silver lining to the story is her brother was able to adopt Lizzy and then handed ownership over to her so they ended up together anyways and are still together till this day but nonetheless, it\u2019s an extreme vetting process to adopt those dogs so don\u2019t get your hopes up.",

If it's difficult to treat PTSD in human soldiers, can you imagine treating them in dogs?\n\nEven the former handlers can't manage them in home life, and completely unaware civilians are in for a shock. Many of these dogs adopted out or adopted by their soldier handlers can he returned and put to sleep. The most trained dog handlers have problems with them.\n\nI'm glad Robby's Law was passed, and a lot of these dogs can be retrained, depending on what they did for the military and how much combat that was seen. But before every Redditor reads this and runs off to adopt a new pet that definitely needs a lot of love, and trained their pup to sit/stay all that.... These dogs are older war dogs. They are trained for war. Sure, well trained, yes, but for things you don't want them to do. They are not good for families, especially those with small children and argumentative teenagers who do teenage things. What can be a simple as a stomping foot or a door slam can very much be a trigger to protect.\n\nThey are also used to one person, and being fiercely loyal to one person. While, you may have a two person household, and the dog may adjust provided they are introduced together, if you are about the dating life, it may not be the best choice in dog.\n\nDogs like this are also very time consuming. Destructive separation anxiety, and need constant care for the first year or so, similar to a newborn.\n\nI'm not trying to dissuade anyone. Like I said above, not every dog is an extreme, or semi-extreme state. Some can be fine with a few non-violent triggers. I'm asking this sub to be honest with themselves and the military should you get called to an interview. Be honest on that application. It's not for the ASPCA/pound/rescue organization where you try to think of what they wanna hear cause some are snooty about adopting out. It's not a decision to be taken lightly because being returned is horribly damaging to a dog like this. And can often be so damaging to the psyche of the dog you have to put it down anyway.\n\nMost ppl that apply don't get chosen for the dog.\n\nEdit: For anyone asking for a source: Smithsonian Magazine, January 2019, *America at War: The Story of Dyngo, a War Dog Brought Home from Combat*\n\nYeah, I actually didn't \"make it up.\"",

Working dogs undergo rigorous pre-adoption work and must be reviewed by behavior experts. I have treated hundreds of retired working dogs and have never met a single one that needed to be \u201creturned and put to sleep\u201d. I have known only a single situation that a soldier needed to return a dog back into adoption criteria because he was forced to return to the barracks. Dogs that have a long history of aggression against humans or other animals are not given the opportunity for adoption and are euthanized after multiple reviews from different boards. It is only a worst case scenario situation. And PTSD in dogs is actually relatively easy to treat with SSRIs and event based sedatives (for 4th of July, etc) since they do not have the intense cognitive abilities and memories that humans dwell on. They just react to events that have historically caused them trauma.",

He always protected, guarded, and followed my mother and I everywhere. He was always on alert, but was so loving in his \"off duty\" time :) \n\nI miss you, buddy. Thank you for being the best protector. Dogs are worth giving a second chance.",

They would change through multiple handlers during their time and always seemed lonely and confused because they just wanted to play but only the handler was allowed to \u201cexercise\u201d the dog. The ones I really felt bad for were the ones trained and given to the Afghan Army and police. They treated their dogs like pieces of trash.",

I didn\u2019t really understand his stories at the time because I was so young, but he helped me train my dog from his rocking chair on the porch. My dog learned a bunch of silly tricks but she could also locate family members by name and open doors on command.",

He is a german shepherd and only like 2 years old (had to retire from a minor leg injury, still very healthy) and he is obviously very well trained. He never really got to interact with other dogs while on the job so they sent him to puppy school to learn how to make friends and socialize.\n\nMy little dog is usually afraid of big dogs but that big boy is so sweet and gentle that he's very comfortable with him :)",

    "postText": "Lead aggregators are companies like Angi, Home Adviser, CraftJack, and Networx. Consumers use them to find home services like handymen, plumbers, or whatever. When you enter your information and request a contractor, that \u201clead\u201d goes out to all of the contractors for that service in your geographic area that are signed up with that aggregator. And all of them are charged for that \u201clead\u201d, anywhere from $20 up to over $100 each. So, yes, they\u2019re all going to call you and try to get your business. So don\u2019t be ugly to them when they call. They\u2019ve already been charged for receiving your contact information. Why YSK is because these \u201cleads\u201d are expensive, the contractor can\u2019t give you as good of a deal on the work. You\u2019re better off just googling for the work you need or asking a friend or neighbor. Google still charges if the contractor is using pay per click or local ad services but it\u2019s much cheaper for them than the lead aggregators.",

            "comment": "I tried Angi recently because I needed a new roof. Never again. Never, ever again. I was flooded with calls, starting within a minute of submitting my request. The calls kept coming for three weeks, nonstop. There is no way to call them off!\n\nAnd there is no guarantee that all of the contractors are legit. I got obvious con artists in the mix, lots of out of state companies, lots of aggressive hard-selling. One guy asked me to sign a paper - for his boss, he said, just to show he'd given me all the required bullet points. As I was about to sign it, I glanced at the top of the sheet and saw that it was in fact a contract. Angi does not vet its subscribers.\n\nTalking to one of the legit guys, I found out that not only does the service provider pay for leads, they pay again if they get the job, all on top of the hefty monthly fee just to be on the list.\n\nAnd to top it all off, my inbox is now flooded with Angi-related spam. Not just Angi, but all their subsidiaries and partners (e.g. Home Advisor). And I am convinced they've sold my information to other marketers, because I've also seen an uptick in spam related to other services as well.\n\nNever again, Angi.",

Put my info in, got absolutely assaulted with phone calls, emails and texts from this one guy. Asked if he was insured which he wasn\u2019t so I turned him down and now for months he\u2019s assaulting me again saying I need to reimburse him for the Angi lead fee. Don\u2019t be scammed, Angi does not charge the customer for the lead fee nor should you reimburse someone for a lead fee if you turn them down for the job",

Part of our licensing dues we pay each year go to funding these agencies. These are also the agencies that write our code and provide inspections for the work we do.\n\nIt has always been that way, even before the internet. The publice could call or write to check on a person or a company and see if they are licensed. It's public knowledge that your tradesmen actually *pay* to provide the public with.\n\nAngi would have you believe she's giving you some inside secret knowledge. \n\nThey were bought some years ago by a holdings company that alao bought their competitor, home advisor. And also Tinder....",

When you get to 23 you are deemed as a mature student and are granted access to courses that you may have not gotten points for...\nThis is also open to international students within the EU",

Since schools know they can get students to take on massive debt (and the debt cannot be shaken with bankruptcy), then schools are incentivized to jack up the prices instead of having to compete on quality for cost.\n\nThe rest of the world is almost always going to be cheaper than the US for the same or better quality. If a school year costs 40k in the US, the equivalent education can be had in the EU for 10-20k.\n\nOnly the top tier US education in the 70k+ /yr range is on a league of its own, and at that point the extra value is in obsessive academic standards, but also brand prestige, aggro gatekeeping, and shoe-in high-paying jobs upon graduation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PSA:** Community colleges in the US offer education for about $4k year for 2-year degrees, and there are some that offer 4-year degrees for around $10k /yr. Some community schools have good ratings, so it would be worthwhile to move to the district of a good school to have access to an affordable degree.\n\nAlso, around 30 states offer [some form of free college](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/free-college-is-now-a-reality-in-nearly-30-states.html). And the current US president has been trying to make some college free for all Americans, but has been stopped by the politics of our time. He says he's not going to stop trying, so maybe there's more to come.\n\nHere's an example of a pathway for a young student. A person could attend local college for 2 years for free at one of the states that offer it. Then move for 2 years to a school that offers a 4-year program, to complete an undergrad degree. Than move to a private school with a brand name, for a 1-2 year masters, and that last school name is what ends up at the top of the resume.",

Each state has its own rules. I recommend you search details for your state more directly.\n\nSeparately, the [Pell Grant](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pell-grant) is a gov program that is available to all US citizens of financial need. The advantage of a federal program is that it applies more broadly to schools around the country. There's a cap that won't cover private education, but it may cover most to all of community college costs even at states that don't offer any help of their own.\n\nThe max Pell Grant award is \\~$7k. That would cover most 2-year community colleges, and pay the bulk of a 4-year community college. A student might be able to graduate locally with a 4-year degree for under $10k total investment if they plan it out and move to the right district(s).\n\nHere is a [list of affordable 4-year schools](https://thebestschools.org/rankings/bachelors/affordable/four-year-college-in-each-state/) per state.",

In Canada, I can take online courses from a University for just over $900 for a 3 credit course and that includes text books (but very little actual learning support). I could also take the same classes locally and in person at a cost of just under $500, but have to buy my own text books. These are business degree classes, and paying as a Canadian citizen. International students pay about triple.",

However it wasn't enough water and eating a lot of salty food caused me to get a kidney stone.\n\nWhy YSK: Previously I thought only people who drank soda constantly would get kidney stones, but I was wrong and hope to save someone else from making the same mistakes.\n\nA source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/kidney-stones/eating-diet-nutrition",

            "comment": "Hi everyone, urologist here! Yeah, lots of salt intake over time isn\u2019t great for stone risk, but kidney stones tend to take weeks to months to form, so binging some chips and ramen for a couple days isn\u2019t likely the only culprit. \n\nStones can be made of lots of different things, so it\u2019s important that if you can capture a stone to send to the lab, your doctor can go over with you the specific ways to prevent your type of stones. Some people just pass one when they got horribly dehydrated for some time and it never happens again, and some people are stone factories making new ones every few weeks. I hope you aren\u2019t in the second group! \n\nMost common type is calcium oxalate, so for people who\u2019ve had these stones, common recommendations are drinking at least 2L water per day, and decreasing oxalate-rich foods (spinach/leafy greens, chocolate, nuts tend to be the big ones). Oddly actual calcium intake from milk, cheese, etc doesn\u2019t seem to make much a difference. Soda isn\u2019t great either because of the phosphoric acid load (makes your body absorb more oxalate = increases risk for these stones). Other types of stones may be able to be treated with changing the pH of the urine, dissolving them, meds to change how kidney metabolism works, it really depends on what the stone is made of.  But water is good for everyone.  \n\nHope you\u2019re feeling better now that\u2019s it\u2019s passed!\n\nEdit: TLDR drink water to stay hydrated. If you\u2019ve never had a stone, don\u2019t go making crazy diet changes or avoiding spinach and nuts to try to prevent them. Low salt diet is generally good for more things than preventing stones. Advice from your own doctor is always better than advice from someone on the internet who doesn\u2019t know you!",

Initially formation of CaC2O4 stones starting in '04 was caused by a tumor of the parathyroid, but about a year after that was removed I started forming them again. My dietitian mother helped me with a \"kidney stone\" diet so I could reduce intake of food &amp; drink with oxalic acid/oxalates (which you know is not a diet conducive to preventing cancer, heart disease, etc), I was drinking so much water with lemon/lime it was coming out of my ears, but I was still ending up in the ER every 2-3mos due to stones, sometimes much more frequently. I also ended up with a staghorn that required surgical intervention.\n\nThen we moved, and I was referred to a new uro who asked me to start taking this supplement. Between the Vicodin, FloMax and ondansertron I'd also become extremely constipated and ended up with diverticulitis, which is even MORE fun than killme stones!! So I said yes to the TheraLith.\n\nI've been taking it since 2016 and while my kidneys do still have calculi, I no longer develop stones large enough to cause pain, let alone the need to use FloMax and Vicodin (and the ondansertron because the FloMax makes me nauseous), let alone having to go to ER because I can't control the pain and can't pass the stone (I'm a woman btw). Current docs say that they're all small enough to pass. \n\nI can easily say it's literally changed my life. They should be paying me to promote this product because I'll tell anyone who'll listen -- if you're forming CaC2O4 stones take TheraLith!!\n\nI wonder what I'd sound like if I were dry inside and you shook me.

Low fluid intake, high protein intake, high salt intake, etc.) is the more likely the cause.\n\nThanks in advance :)",

The metabolism is a bit more complicated than it\u2019s worth delving into on Reddit.\n\nIn general, more sodium in the diet means your body has to get rid of more of it in your urine. It takes calcium along with it as a passenger. More calcium in the urine increases the risk for calcium stones. This is all mitigated by some other factors like citrate that are probably more eloquently explained by a nephrologist (urologists are more in the business of blasting the stones with lasers!) but all this to say, decreasing your sodium intake is healthy for more than just preventing stones. If anything, the best reason to do it for your health is to keep your heart and blood pressure healthy.",

Of course it\u2019s not quite that straightforward because everyone makes stones for different reasons, which is why one-size-fits-all stone advice is really tough. Drinking enough water is really the only prevention advice that applies to everyone. \n\nIf you\u2019re someone who makes multiple stones, a lot of urologists and nephrologists will have you collect 24 hours worth of your urine in a jug (fun, I know), and ship it off to be analyzed. That way, we can tell how concentrated/dilute the urine is and how much you peed (assessing hydration), how much calcium, sodium, oxalate, magnesium, etc are in the urine. Too much or too little of those various things may get you some slightly different advice. \n\nI\u2019m a hypocrite, but again, drink water!",

Fun fact: people with kidney stones who are waiting to pass them are told to ride rollercoasters. \n\nDrinking lots of water also helps, as it increases the flow rate through the kidneys making it more likely for the tiny crystals to flush out before they solidify into a stone. \n\nMost kidney stones are made of calcium oxalate. Reducing the amount of oxalates in your food can help prevent them, but oxalate-rich foods are healthy otherwise (blueberries, green leafy vegetables) or delicious (red meat, coffee, chocolate, red wine) so that\u2019s not gonna happen in my case.",

Lifestyle is influential obviously, but some people are more genetically prone to them as well (so they have to be extra careful on the lifestyle front). \n\nMy dad suffered from horrible kidney stones and my sister got her first one at 17. They both drank plenty of water and had average amounts of salt in their diet. We all lived in a house together (very similar lifestyles and at least 80% shared meals) and the people who take heavily after my dad\u2019s side of the family (my dad and my sister, I take much more after my mother\u2019s side health-wise) are the only ones with the issue. Doctor told my sister that given my dad\u2019s history, she was probably super prone to them and she\u2019d have to be more careful than average with hydration and salt, etc. \n\nSo while it\u2019s always a good idea to stay hydrated and keep sodium intake at healthy levels, OP may be more prone to them genetically and his level of salt intake may genuinely have been on the average side and not result in any kidney stones in someone without his predisposition. \n\nIt\u2019s just hard to know if you\u2019re prone to them until it\u2019s too late, lol.

I\u2019ve read that coffee can increase the likelihood of getting them. But I\u2019ve also read that coffee can *decrease* the likelihood of getting kidney stones.\n\nI have no idea what to believe",

Got my first job as a freshman and wasn\u2019t allowed to drink water at the cash register at a grocery store (Fuck you, Debbie). Pissed rust one day and then shrugged it off. Next week was the worst week of my life. I prayed god would kill me to let it end lmao. \n\nMoral of the story, fuck Debbie and fuck creatine.",

Loved the stuff , super tasty and super easy quick lunch, ate it at least 3 times a week. Was very active and watched what I was eating also(so I thought) also drank a lot of Pepsi Max(2 cans a day). Wasn\u2019t until recently I read the ingredients on the seasoning that I saw it contained a big percentage of garlic salt. Needless to say  I don\u2019t eat that much anymore. So I\u2019ve put it down to constant consumption of that and sugar free soda. \n\nPain wise it was the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life\u2026and I\u2019ve degloved my finger in a car engine! Started with pissing blood whilst on holiday in Rome(great timing), pain would come and go as the stone was passing through, painkillers did abit but sometimes nothing at all. Worst feeling for me was probably when it was in my bladder constantly feeling like I needed to piss razor blades. Hospitals are shite in my country so by the time it took them to diagnose and book me in for a follow up with the urologist I had passed it. Great times.\n\nFunnily enough Few years later I ended up working for a company that sold Uretoscopes and got to see the operation I would of had first hand. Amazing to see urologists in action and the precision they have when lasering stones.",

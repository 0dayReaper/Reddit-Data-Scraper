    "postText": "Why YSK: one of the common symptoms of being depressed is that life feels overwhelmingly stressful. The fact that the things which cause stress decrease will not necessarily cause the depressed individual to feel that their life is less overwhelmingly stressful. \n\nI see this with my wife and her family all the time. She has been battling depression for years, and when something happens which reduces the direct burden on her (i.e. son gets into pre-k so she is only taking care of two children for most of the day), her parents act like everything must be feeling so much better now that her life is less hectic. \n\nThis misunderstanding itself causes her more pain and worsens her mental health.",

Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text and there should be an option to change your screen colors. I\u2019ve been doing it about a few months and I dont get so emotional (happy/sad/angry) from my screen so much anymore. It\u2019s helped a little with my mental health, not a lot but i do notice it.",

Now, 8 years sober,  it's just thoughts every once in awhile of 'it'd be so much easier to just not exist' instead.  Tried all kinds of antidepressants to help with depression but they all had some kind of wonky side effect.  Talked with my wife and doctor and decided to try microdosing and so far it has been the best.  Not saying it works for everyone, just that it really helped me",

So it went away for them when they met a new crush, after proper grieving, after getting a new job. And they think that's all it'll take for you to feel better too.\n\nIn a sense I'm glad they don't know what it's like, but it's hard trying to explain that life doesn't have to actually suck for you to feel Depressed. That's what makes it a DISorder-it's abnormal feelings and behaviors that don't make sense to normal people. That's the best way I've been able to describe it to my family.",

Often someone who has decided to kill themselves will feel better in general because they have a plan. \n\nA guy who I spoke to who gives talks in schools about suicide said there are 3 questions you should ask. \n\n1. Are you thinking about killing yourself?\n\nAs blunt as that, no euphemism that could be misunderstood.\n\n2. Do you have a plan?\n\nHaving a plan is a much bigger next step, if someone has a plan, they are much closer than someone who doesn't. \n\n3. What is keeping you safe?\n\nWhy hasn't this person done it yet? Is it their friends? Family? A dog they need to look after? Make sure they are then sticking with that person or thing which is keeping them here. \n\nThese questions are supposed to be helpful in keeping your loved ones alive. I learned them after a point which they would have been useful. But they might be needed again. \n\nAlso for what it is worth, if you're reading this and feeling suicidal, the world is better with you in it. Nothing is forever, this too shall pass.",

            "comment": "I never had depression until 7 years ago. My daughter and her BFcouldnt be bothered to look after my grandson, so had social services and a health worker constantly trying to help her. In the end they gave him to me to foster until we could go to court to SGO him. Were family and instead of adoption we were give a special guardianship order, which means we have the over all parental control, just she still has her name on the birth certificate. But at the same time he moves in, she broke up with her bf and ended up moving back in too. She was useless, so ended up kicking her out, but it had to be done. Its a long story. Every few days we'd have a social worker judt dropping in doing spot checks to make sure everything was ok. \n\nThis is when the depression kicked in. Social services wanted to have a choice of who they were going to give him too. There was the paternal grand mother, His dad whos a pot head who use to dissappear for weeks, and his paternal auntie, who funnily enough is married to my husband son. One day when the social worker came my grandson was beside me in the kitchen aa he liked to help. I was talking to the social worker, wasnt watching him, and he found the bag of coco pops Id forgotten to put away, he grabbed them and meant to put them in a cup, but he missed. He was only 2 after all. So the made a mess. I just laughed it off and started picking them up. The social workers face twisted and said maybes he should go to his paternal aunt then.. They'd watch him better. they had 2 kids already and their youngest was left in a high chair most of the time, as they were struggling too.\n\n  Every few weeks the social worker said this, even though my grandson was thriving, learning to talk and learning letters. Playing and reading books together, and him picking out animals. Before hecame to me he never done any of these things.  But the social worker was constantly saying to me he should go to his aunt for anything. It made me so depressed. I felt like I was in a dark place constantly. I wanted to keep him as I loved him,  loads. No one knew him as much as me. He didnt even know the others. No one even cared he was alive. This went on month after month.\n\n My grandson moved in with me in September 2016, but the last court date for the SGO was the middle of April 2017. Plus every week we had to go to court to talk about who was going to get him. His dad and paternal grandmother were both ruled out, so it was between me and aunt. Put it this way the depression was so bad i went from 13 stone to 9 in that time. We all had to have enhanced DPS, full history of everything. full medials. Letter to family about who we were, and aletter from some professional about us. Luckily my husnamd has a friend who knows us quite well and he done us a glowing report. My husbands ex and his youngest son both condemned him, which we'd already warned social services they would do. Aunt never had to do any of this, just me and my husband.\n\nBut in the end we got my grandson. But its left me with crippling anxiety, not wanting to go out, and just bad depression. Its a horrible thing to be left with. Id never had any of this before, and just wish i could feel like what I was before the stress of a SGO but still have my grandson, as I couldnt live without him. It feels like hes mine and my husbands little boy. i was a happy go lucky person before always laughing. Now it takes a lot to make me smile. Apart from my grandson who can make me laugh as hes a funny little boy.  But theres still times i wonder why Im still here, and not dead where I should be, as Im useless. but them I think NO. He is not going to his pateral aunt. No way. And manage to shake it off. Depression is a bitch.",

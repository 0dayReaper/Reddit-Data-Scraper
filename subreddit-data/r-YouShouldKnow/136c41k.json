    "postText": "Why YSK:\n\nin some situations, this can be a very useful way to watch a channel's videos\n\nyou can use this bookmarklet on any YouTube channel's uploaded 'Videos' page:\n\n    javascript:window.location.href=window.location.href+'?view=57';\n\na new button will appear called **\\[ Play All \\]** on the right-side of the page, this is a playlist that will start playing the channel's videos from latest onward\n\nI'm not sure why '57' is special, I tried a bunch of other numbers, but that's the only one I've found that works",

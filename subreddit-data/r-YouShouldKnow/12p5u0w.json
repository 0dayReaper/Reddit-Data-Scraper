    "postText": "Why YSK: So you can tell your gf/bf to get away from that guy/girl they told you not to worry about. It may seem harmless, but it\u2019s not. Especially if the pursuer is prettier/handsomer and/or wealthier. And especially if they are considered a \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nParticularly Machiavellian personalities take advantage of this by pursuing taken individuals, because there\u2019s really no defense against it. Even if they don\u2019t win over the taken individual, the individual will feel less attracted to their partner.\n\nSource: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pere.12433",

I'm going to go out on a limb and say telling your partner they're not allowed to have friends is probably worse for your relationship than them having attractive friends. \n\nA good partner won't intentionally hurt their significant other, and will hear their significant other say, \"Hey, that's really tough for me,\" and take that into account. But a good partner also won't seek to control their significant other due to their own insecurities. Trust is what's missing from posts like this one. Trust is what you have to build with a long-term partner, and if you don't have it your insecurities will tear you down no matter what your partner does.",

That's what that second paragraph is about. A good partner, generally speaking, won't engage in behaviors that they know will hurt your feelings. If this other person's behavior is problematic, you *trust* that your partner will determine what is or isn't appropriate and have a handle on it. \n\nIf you **don't** trust your partner enough to believe that they can have friends they might be attracted to, that's the bigger issue. Even if you make them stop talking to this person, something else will eventually trigger the same insecurity and it will continue to be a problem. Or, alternatively, if they're directly flirting, you communicate your discomfort and they refuse to discuss the situation and work towards resolution, that's a different issue entirely. That's a lack of respect on their part, and I don't know if that's a relationship that's worth holding on to at that point. \n\nI just don't see a world in which \"force your partner not to talk to their friends if it makes you uncomfortable\" is ever good advice. If you feel it's necessary, it seems like either you're an asshole and they should leave you or they're an asshole and you should leave them. In a relationship built on trust and mutual respect, I just don't see how this could be an issue that having a conversation doesn't solve.",

I dropped away from all of my lady friends over time after I was married and my wife did the same with male friends. It was literally for this reason, though we didn\u2019t have \u201cscience\u201d to confirm the idea. It\u2019s just the way things are, and it was done out of mutual respect f( neither of us told the other to do it) and for us to both feel secure, considering neither of us really knew eachother\u2019s opposite sex friends.. Say what you will, but we\u2019ve been married for 14 years and are doing better than ever.\n\nThings like this are very upsetting to consider. Some random coworker cozying up just enough to actually impact my marriage!? It\u2019s scary. But at the end of the day, all you can do is trust that your significant other remains committed to you, and avoids the advances or all out puts a stop to it. If he/she caves to it, well, there\u2019s nothing you could do and it was likely inevitable. Take the loss and move on I guess.. out of respect though, you yourself can avoid the situations that could make you fall for this by shutting down anyone who flirts with you, makes an advance, or even just avoid alone time with that person completely. \n\nOut of my entire life, there were 2 notable times when girls got really weird with me. The first was as soon as my female friends saw my future wife, most of them instantly became interested in me and were very fucking weird lol. It\u2019s like they realized that I was coming off the market and it was their last chance or something (never knew there was interest).. the second was the first couple years after being married, we moved away and I noticed that I got hit on a TON more with a ring on my finger. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this primordial \u201cthrill of the hunt\u201d or something? I dunno.",

Seems a little extreme to me. Unless I'm misinterpreting your comment?\n\n(I'm also a bi woman married to a man so if hubs and I were to follow that rule I'd have no friends lmao)\n\nIn all seriousness though, I'm glad this has worked for you and your partner but it wouldn't work for me in a relationship. To me the foundation of a healthy relationship is trust. I trust my husband to be faithful and know he can be trusted not to be \"tempted\" by someone flirting with him (Case in point... my own sister flirted with him and he just kinda looked at her a moment then asked her to take out the trash lmao). Likewise, my husband has that same faith in me. It made me really sad how surprising it was to people in my family to hear that I wasn't constantly paranoid about him cheating on me with someone at work, someone online, etc.",

For us, it was more of just something that happened. On my end, it was moreso because suddenly lady friends were trying to get my attention in ways they had never done before. And I\u2019d say half of my wife\u2019s dude friends just ghosted her after we got married anyways. The remaining dude friends started acting odd, and she kinda decided it was best to let go. It took a couple years, but gradually those friendships went away. Additionally, my job had us moving across the country so it made things a lot easier in that regard. I may have done a poor job in expanding on that point. \n\nLol yeah I could see being bi, being a serious problem going about things the way we did!! Thank you for speaking up! I appreciate hearing others\u2019 opinions, and it\u2019s the only reason I really share mine.",

Even if you are a great partner and do the \u201cright things\u201d, there are always going to be better looking people or just better people in general.

If you start to feel \u201cjealous\u201d (because you know this is a reality that you would rather not deal with) it looks bad for you too. It\u2019s really not healthy or fair, but it\u2019s relationships. \n\nStay single + happy everyone",

If they know about things like this, and more studies branch from this topic to other, related topics, it spiderwebs out to create a fuller picture of human behavior. That's how science works. I'm sure you can see the merit in that.\n\nAnd also, making other people aware of this will hopefully help them avoid getting taken advantage of by manipulative, and potentially dangerous, individuals. So this stuff DOES matter.",

It is related to social order &amp; hitting the paradigm of it's shift.. The change &amp; it's occurences with respect to variations.. But human behaviour relates to moods, tendency, sensuality &amp; dimension.. Though to some amout psychic variations comes into play but the word psychiatry doesn't seem to fit the project.. And to be very much precise the FBI &amp; CIA have generously failed to understand the core values of human behaviour.. Their thinktank had hit the lowest bottom or else they could have easily prophecised about the tumultuous current affairs.. These researches have been done previously also but have helped much in eradication the nuisances of our society.. And as far criminal investigation is concerned in relation to this research, that's the negligibility of affairs .. Coz changing partners doesn't always make either of the partners concerned with criminal concepts.. What's you say on this??",

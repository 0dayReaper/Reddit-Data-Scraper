They then argued that they have no way of knowing that I didnt get my order and offered 20$, but I kept at it until the order was fully refunded.\nI also have a coworker that had to wait 3 weeks to refund his order after skip took over 3 hours to deliver a Mc Donald's coffee/breakfast order that was received after lunch and was noticeably made 3 hours prior. There was no way to cancel the order once it was being prepared, he just had to sit there and watch it die on the skipthe dishes tracker while they tried to reassign different drivers. He too had to argue for the full refund.\n\nThey just hope you give up and go away, fuck em.",

If you're ordering for a group, this puts you in the position of discovering you're missing several people's food, calling the restaurant and hearing that they're staring at your missing food, but can't really do anything. Your choices at that point are to ask DD for a partial refund, or to drive across town yourself and get your missing items. This has happened to me several times.  I'd rather just pickup my own damn food because at least I will check things before returning home.",

He then hurriedly went back to car and started scraping at his back seat in my front street, so I curiously watched as I grabbed my order. He jumped when he noticed me, waved, wished me a good day and scrambled out of there. \n\nI opened my pizza and there it was, a clumped up mess of toppings and dirt from his vehicles carpets.

After about 30 minutes past the schedule drop off time I called door dash and got a refund. But before I did this I called the local McDonald\u2019s that I had ordered from and spoke with the manager and she stated that the food was there and that no driver had been confirmed for the pick up. What she did next was above customer service. She told me she would drop it off personally or have one of her employees drop it off. At this point my mouth hit the floor. 5 minutes later my food is at the door. She had given me the food for free because it was no longer hot.. I paid the young man the full price of the original DD order which came to almost 30$. Told the kid to give it to the manager and proceeded to eat my cold food. That was the last time I used DoorDash",

A lot of hate for restaurants specializing in chicken wings. They get to know their areas and will deny particular restaurants if the order shows up. The app somewhat tells them how much the tip is before hand, but sometimes it gives you more than it offers. I think it stops telling them after $8+. They get $3 from DoorDash, plus whatever you give as a tip. Sometimes it gives surprise extra money to them, like it'll say $6 but give $7, I don't know. I don't really understand that. Then they have challenges where they get a bonus if they do 60 deliveries in a week or whatever. It was r/doordash and /r/doordash_drivers if you're interested.

I would say its basically the tip and the perceived efficiency of the restaurant and delivery address. \n\nMcDonald's is great IMO. They package the food better than anyone, are pretty punctual and if I'm polite they are almost always too.  Chipotle is the one fast food place that I sometimes hate, and its rely just cause they are busy AF at times. I'm trying to be as covid safe as possible so I don't like sharing air with dozens of people in a small space and fuck looking through dozens of crowded shelves with a bunch of people that don't mind standing shoulder to shoulder.  If you live in a sprawling apt complex(with poor signage) or some sort of giant building I'm avoiding your order pretty much no matter the tip. But above all else your tip is going to assure your order doesn't get declined repeatedly. The amount of people that don't tip is significant.  Eventually DD will start upping their base pay offer to get a driver to take it.\n\nMy biggest complaint about my fellow drivers is they can be assholes to the restaurant staff, which I see as my coworkers if anything.  And some of them drive like complete dipshits, parking wherever is convenient,  and creeping slow AF hunting for addresses. Ive delivered for several chain restaurants in my life and I'm a respectful and conscientious human being, so maybe thats too much to ask from most people. \nBest thing you can do as a customer is don't expect people to be less picky than they have to be, eg. if you're in a busy area tip well enough to compete with other people ordering.  And have a visible address or give decent and concise instructions.  It's not a bunch of cracks heads out here delivering its probably as professionally staffed as your random pizza delivery place on average. But with a much larger pool of potential drivers. And 99.9% of the time I'm late its the restaurant being slow/busy/messing things up or the app not anticipating how busy the restaurant is. \n\nSorry if this is disjointed,  I felt like offering some insight but its gone a little overboard and it's late AF where I'm at.",

After ordering from the delivery app, they usually put in an ad for their own website with your order so you know where to order from next time. I've also had places where just picking up and doing take-out yourself gives you discounts, but the prices on the menus stay the same. So these might be loop-holes stores can use or the people ordering just don't complain about it so the apps can't check.",

Having a delivery driver on staff is another wage to pay, and the driver can only drive.  Why should the company pass that cost onto all of the in-store customers using their own time and gas to come in?\n\nDomino's isn't making a killing off delivery fees.  If it takes your driver 10 minutes and 5 miles round trip to deliver your pizza we are already looking at an extra $2 in labor @ $12/hr and $1.25 in mileage @ $0.25/mi.  These extra costs are completely avoided with pickup orders.",

As others have said, these delivery places will add restaurants without asking - with outdated menus, and menu items that don't travel well. So now you have orders from existing customers that may go through door dash and you get less of their spent dollar, and both they and new customers have a much higher chance of receiving a cold, late meal. Many of those dissatisfied customers will blame you regardless of the reality.\n\nThere are certainly situations where outsourced delivery can work and work well for a restaurant. But underhanded tactics and iffy margins mean it's not right for everyone.",

Restaurants hate it for tons of reasons, drivers and customers as well.\n\nSomehow these things all co-exist: customers hate it for how expensive it is, drivers hate it because of how unreliant and terrible pay can be, and restaurants often don't make and sometimes lose money on it.\n\nAnd somehow when it IPO'd on the stock market earlier this week it immediately spiked more than 15% from its already WAY overvalued initial price.\n\nI fucking swear DoorDash is just the modern pets.com",

Not participating in the app means \\*all\\* orders go to their competitors, and an awful lot of new customers use the app to find somewhere rather than a web search or the yellow pages.\n\nThe cost argument is all about overheads, and selling enough to cover them. Many costs are fixed - rent, the staff, the delivery cost, and often the food. So at best the delivery services let them spread those costs over a larger number of orders. At worst their overheads are worse than their competition so they lose more money with every order. This is why you see more \"dark kitchens\" where there's no restaurant, just a tiny, cheap to rent place in an alleyway... anything to get the overheads down.\n\nThe problem is that the restaurant has no control over how the app works and is very vulnerable to \"would you like to buy ads? Places that don't buy ads find they get fewer orders\" and just sheer arbitrary algorithm changes.\n\nThe saving is the new customers they find through the app and convert to direct-order.",

Don't call somebody who then misunderstands you and you get the wrong thing that you have to pay cash. Just use this neat app and pay by credit card or PayPal!

            "comment": "Expanding on this LPT, as far as northern Europe is concerned.  \n\n\nThe apps we use around here are basically the go-to app for food delivery. If a restaurant doesn't have a deal with the app, people won't find it unless they literally see the store, which most people never do. This is due to Google's algorithms, which the local app usually controls so as to drown out individual restaurants. So to be known to the public and generate business you'll have to make a deal with the app.  \n\n\nThe app charges a 30% or so fee on deliveries. This eats most of the store's profit. But remember, unless you're on the app, people won't find you = no business.  \n\n\nThe dilemma for restaurants is:  \nA) Sign a deal with the app to generate more business with extremely thin margins  \nB) Don't sign a deal and risk not having any business at all  \n\n\nAs an end result you can see many stores having higher prices on the apps (yes, about 30% or so), than they advertise in the restaurant. I'm not sure if this is entirely legal, but I suspect it's a loophole utilizing in-store discounts as a technicality.  \n\n\nSo, if you want to be really smart, just call the restaurant directly with your order. Odds are you'll get it cheaper and the restaurant will make a bigger profit off of it.  \n\n\n(This mostly applies to restaurants that haven't made a name of themselves as they are, such as Michelin star restaurants, or other such that don't *need* to advertise.)",

They do some daily lunch and dinner menus at a discount, which are cheaper than their in store menu, which are cheaper than the app menu, and the delivery cost of ordering straight from the restaurant is literally 30% of the delivery price on the app. No, not 30% less than the app price, literally 30% of the app price, a 70% discount. I have eaten so much sushi this last year it is offensive.",

And I don\u2019t think any of my customers need to worry themselves with it.\n\nHeck, low margin businesses can actually be even *better* for a community.  Restaurants are a great example, since they offer a widely used public service, waiters make decent money, etc.  Low margins means a lot of money back into the community if suppliers are local.\n\nOf course when 30% of the order goes to the delivery company, that\u2019s a different story.\n\nI personally own a relatively high margin, high revenue-per-employee business, so I have nothing but respect for low margin businesses.  They churn more money back into the community directly through the business, which is great.",

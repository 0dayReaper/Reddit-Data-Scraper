    "postText": "**Why YSK:** I saw a post where someone paid $400 to get a window fixed. I almost made the same mistake because I\u2019m generally scared to call the insurance company. Turns out most policies includes glass coverage and the insurance company has an arrangement with some local places to fix it with nothing out of pocket. Or they\u2019ll reimburse you if you want to use another place.\n\nTL/DR: check your auto insurance before paying to replace a window, it might be free.\n\nEdit: it seems like this varies a bit by state in the US and also may or may not include windshields (as opposed to the other \u201cwindows\u201d that aren\u2019t the windshield). Also this was meant to apply to \u201ccomprehensive\u201d coverage which I noted in the title but forgot to note in the body of the post.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve not switched insurance companies in over a decade as I\u2019ve been happy with mine but some folks in the comments say that these \u201cfree\u201d claims can result in higher premiums down the line if you look for a change of coverage.",

And let me reiterate 300$ is a quite conservative estimate, and that's not even taking into account renting another car while yours is in the shop.",

Ford, Chevy, GMC, jeep, and even now newer Kia and Hyundai vehicles. And some Hondas. Safelite can come out to you, do the windshield, take it for a quick drive with the tablet hooked into your odb2 port, and you are good to go. More and more vehicle manufacturers are trying to switch to a dynamic calibration as it is much easier and does not require the target stands needed for a static recalibration.",

So if I paid \u00a32/mo for a zero deductible, it would be worth it if I broke some glass at least once every 3 years. If I break glass less often, it wouldn't be worth it.",

Would get cracks/break windshield 1-2x a year back then. \n\nNow Ive lived right next to a rock/stone company for the last 3 years and it's common to get stuck behind them based on when we leave for work. I've been more lucky so far and only have replaced my wife's windshield once, but mine just got a crack in it about a week ago which will require replacement\n\nMy 0 dollar glass deductible was only an extra $1.95 a month so it's still way cheaper than replacing my windshield without it.",

And the crappy off brand glass safelite put in contributed to half of the windshields I had to replace \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f so, figuring $500 per (good, oem) windshield, including installation, that\u2019s about 2 grand right there.\n\nOh and I was driving about 22-25k per year at the time - 120+ mile commute daily.. one of them I was changing lanes behind a dump truck and *WHACK!* giant rock flew off the truck, bounced off the freeway and slammed my windshield. Thank goodness that was with the original oem glass!\nEdit: just did the math: 220 days at 120 miles *just commuting* was 26,400 miles - plus weekend road trips regularly over 500-1000 miles, a few trips to California and back at like 1200 miles each way.. y\u2019know, driving.

I used to play baseball at the ball fields on the south end of the island (couldn't figure out a way to tell the story without that somehow) and the parking lot was/is close to the ball fields. So everyone that shows up knows not to park in the first 5 or 6 stalls basically the ones near enough to be typical foul ball territory. Almost everyone.. One day some dude pulls up in his brand new $150k Mercedes to play ball, and assumes he's getting a great spot - cars are lined up on the street, parked 1/4 mile away etc.. he got the front spot! Lucky! \nSo my dad, being the nice guy he is, politely says to him \"hey, you might not want to park there, that's..-\" and the guy cuts him off \"oh fuck off, I'm so tired of you people telling me I can't park here.. just fuck right off.\" \nAnd so we fucked right off to our softball game. Where, in the second inning, someone pops up a high fly ball, straight into foul ball territory.. the whole crowd had witnessed the prior interaction, and knew what was about to happen. *smash* the ball goes through the guys back window, bounces off and hits his trunk leaving a nice softball sized dent. We all hear \"FUCK! My new Benz!\" And see the guy run over to his car. \"Why didn't anybody tell me I shouldn't park here? I'm gonna sue!\" \n\nThe whole crowd, who'd witnessed everything, just laughed at the guy, one guy, a lawyer, piped up \"ha! We *allll* saw the interaction when you got here, and we *dont* like *you.* We *do* like *him* though. And *he* told you not to park there, and *you* told him to fuck off. Now I think it's *your* turn.\"",

The first two times were through Safeco who partners with safelite. The oem windshield took a huge rock and had a small crack that eventually spread, that was the first new windshield through safelite. Within a month it had a tiny pebble bounce up and tap it, garnering a huge crack immediately. Replaced within a week or so. Didn't know about the non-oem glass safelite used. Another tiny pebble and another big crack less than a month later. Now, by this time I'd been on the Jeep forums. That's when I learned about their shite glass. Then found out you just have to ask for oem glass, not oem equivalent or anything else, even their gorilla glass was shite. Had that last windshield until 2017 when another big rock off a dump truck put a crack in it. \nI had that oem in since 2017 and I sold it with that windshield in it last November. \n\nThe rocks that took out the oem windshield were loud enough to scare the shit out of me and pray the windshield didn't cave in on me. The shite glass was a tiny \"tick!\" As they bounced off.",

ANYTIME YOU SPEND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MONEY ITS A CLAIM. I've seen people who have two windshield claims get rejected. Please don't use your insurance unless you absolutely have to.",

Something (tree, space rock, errant wheel, baseball bat, whatever) falls on or otherwise impacts the vehicle while it\u2019s parked. Fire, theft, flooding, glass, all that is under comprehensive. \n\nIf you were operating the vehicle and caused a collision (or an allision), that falls under collision and does impact your premiums if there was a payout.",

Safelite replaced the windshield on my wife's current car 3 times.   \n\n\nPro tip, if the damage shows any sign of spreading, let it spread an inch or so before calling for replacement. otherwise, they will try to get away with filling it instead of replacing the windshield.",

    "postText": "Why YSK, Because it may help you understand the other side, and save you time and stress\n\nHey  guys, this is going to be from the call center side, because I have  worked for three, and I truly believe people don't know these things.\n\nYou  may not care because \"ItS yOuR JoB\" but I figured I would still post  because some people may learn something they don't know. Some of this  will depend on what type of place you are calling, but most will be  universal.\n\nCall times - Every call  center has a call time metric, for one reason or another. I am not  saying you need to be super fast,  you should ask all of your questions  and get answers, but if you are calling while you're in the middle of  the floor at work, or in a drive through, or anything else where you  have to stop us every few minuets to say \"hold on a moment\" then please  consider calling at another time if you can.\n\nAvailable  information - This goes along with call times above, but its its own  thing because I personally find it annoying. If you are calling in for a  specific reason, PLEASE have whatever you need before hand. If you are  calling to rent a truck/car or schedule a service, please have the card  number we will need. You know going in you are going to need it. Please  be prepared. If you have an account number or some other number, please  have it ready, don't put us on hold while you go through all your mail. I  understand you can't be ready with everything, we might throw you a  curve ball, but please have the basic's.\n\nHanging  up - This is a big one, it hurts call time but also seems to piss  people off. We, on our side, can not usually hang up calls. We can if  its a no response, or if a person is being very verbally abusive or  something. But if we are just done with your service, and you throw your  phone on the table assuming we will hang up, we are not supposed to.  There are even ways to track the times we have ended a call, and if your  company sucks it can be use against use.\n\nHelp  - This is my job, and I am happy to help, really, but, if you are  sitting in a 5 minute que just to ask me if a local store has boxes in  stock, please just consider using the website if you have access to it. I  guarantee that unless its specially equipment I am just using the  website as well, and it sucks you waited in a que for that long.\n\nFront  loading info - Please don't front load the info before we even start  addressing what you need. The amount of time people call and I say \"Hi  my name is X thank you for calling\" and I get cut off with either a  phone or account number right off the bat, (I do appreciate you being  ready) or a 5 minuet story about whats wrong before I can even respond,  can mess things up. We have different systems we use for different  things. And if I don't even know what system I need to be in I can't  start taking information. That makes me end up having to ask you to  repeat yourselves which pisses a lot of people off because they assume I  wasn't listening. I was, I just was not in the right place to write it  down.\n\nNothing available - Please  believe us when we say we don't have what you want available. Weather  its renting a truck, picking up an item, or something else. I guarantee I  am not hiding something from you because I don't want you to have it.  Oh, you drove by the local store and saw the thing that you wanted? That  doesn't mean its not all ready slated to go to someone else who is just  waiting to pick it up. We want to give you what you want, but if we  don't have it we don't have it.\n\nGiving  out info - Please understand, no matter what the call center, if its a  bank, store, moving trucks, if you are not the person on the account, or  authorized on the account, we can not help you. It does not matter what  your circumstance is. We can direct you to what you actually need to do  or where you need to go, but we can not tell you anything. And no, I  can't make a reservation in someone else's name if they are not on the  phone.\n\nSurveys - I saw someone mention this in the comments and wanted to add it, because I am sure most people don't know how this works. In every company I have ever worked for, if you are not scoring perfect/almost perfect 9/10 (Or whatever the high number is) then it is seen as a complaint. You wanted to give a 5 because you though the service was average? No, what our managers read is we just slapped your unborn child with a wet tuna and we suck. I am not saying don't give real scores, but please don't give middle scores thinking they are actually seen as in the middle.\n\nIf you read all of this, I  applaud you, thank you, and hope you learned something that can make  your life, and the life of your future call center reps easier.\n\nIf anyone has questions or wants me to clarify the points above I would be happy to answer.",

                    "comment": "Call centres suck to work for.  I have worked for a few years at a council call centre and another for just a few weeks doing what was supposed to be 'selling phone contracts' but ended up being something else entirely, but from a mix of that and retail, I can assure you 99% of the time the person pushing sales most likely doesn't want to, they are probably just desperate because if you don't hit a quota you can get in trouble.  Of course there are people desperate for sales if they have an incentive to do so but a lot of the time there's a script you \\*have\\* to follow that you can get in trouble for not following, especially if the call is being listened to by a manager or trainer as it's happening.\n\nLong holds are either from the person trying to help you trying to find information or having to ask a colleague for help.  Sometimes it's because a system is down and being rebooted or is just slow and the call handler isn't good with smalltalk but also doesn't want you to just sit in awkward silence with them still on the line.  For the places I worked for, the systems were excrutiatingly ancient to save on every penny and would just chug for no reason at all.  Of course, sometimes it can just be because the handler needs a moment to just breathe if something on their end is causing them distress or they are starting to worry you're going to flip out on them.\n\nOf course these issues could also be just from 'the person is just being slow and stupid and lazy and trying to squeeze money out of you for their bonus' for either of these but just letting you know what it could be from the other side's perspective too.",

One of the metrics an outsource company will be measured against is answer/abandon rate. This will vary depending on the company but its not unusual to have an SLA (service level agreement) of e.g. 90% of calls answered within 60s and an abandoned rate of less than 5% (as in, only 5% of caller hang up).\n\nThe phone trees help a little, in that the timer only starts ticking once the customer has selected their options, but it only really shifts the problem out.\n\nIf you always experience long hold times it will be for one of two main reasons: \n\n1. The company has unrealistic targets or forecasts for the outsource company. (E.g. they expect calls to take 3mins when in reality they always take 6, or they've told the outsource to expect 5,000 calls between 11-12 and they actually receive 10,000).\n\n2. You are calling during peak hours and there simply isn't a way to man the line to answer all of them. Think about it this way, an average shift is 8 hours - you might have people starting at 7am, 8am etc. right through to midday if the line is open from 7am-9pm) that means you'll have the biggest amount of staff in between 12-4 so can take more calls but *everybody* wants to call during their lunch break. A company might have 4-8 times as many people covering this shift, but you maybe get 10-20xs as many calls during 12-2. You're not going to find many people wanting to do a 2 hour shift, and neither is the main company going to pay you, as an outsourcer,  to have staff sitting there at 10am or 4pm twiddling their thumbs and not answering calls.\n\nThe way that this works is that the outsource company has to hit every other interval in the day (typically a 15min period) and exceed their SLA (so answer 95%+ of calls within 60s) so that they can end the day in a positive position after failing the 8 intervals between 12-2.\n\nTL;DR - try calling mid-morning or mid-afternoon and you'll get through *much* quicker.",

This is specially true for large companies where call volumes are exceptionally high that it doesn't meet the number of agents thay they have live for any given time of the day. If you're working for a company that deals with financials, you're bound to get a hundred or so calls a day, but that's not enough to even meet the call volume if there was no virtual agent to try and filter out your concerns. The idea is that the machine can resolve surface level issues that does not require a human agent, or be a buffer so that it can route you to an available agent. If not, then its function is to signal you to call another time, or browse through the self-help articles, \"resolution centers\", or asynchronous chats that the company may have had created on their website for you.",

I had already decided to quit so I ignored all the managers all day and did the unthinkable: I helped people and did what they needed.\n\nThese places are deliberately run in such a way that you're unlikely to get any help in the end. Person or no, the structure of the job effectively demands the customer be their own advocate to a potentially rude degree.\n\nThe quiet and patient ones often just got their call \"dropped\" ( it's a button, and it's on purpose)",

They promise you 2 weeks of paid sick days a year but the catch is that you can\u2019t actually use all of them because each sick day counts as a point against you. So, if you use them all you are on a final warning, and one step from being fired. There is no such thing as an excused absence. \n\nSure, they give you bereavement, but being sick always gets you a strike. So, if you get to that point of using all your sick time, if you\u2019re even a minute late you\u2019ll be fired. We would get creative and use them all right before it rolled over and the points expired, but if you messed it up or timed it wrong it would fuck you, because they would write you up on a final warning and even though those days expired they would still ding you if you were within that write up warning period. It was all bullshit. \n\n\nThey were so bad a lot of people just said fuck it and would just turn a few sick days into a short term disability leave in order to keep their job and still get paid. Their doctor would approve it because of the circumstances of our jobs rules. It was one of the shittiest jobs I ever had. Good benefits, but they treated us like shit, and micromanaged like crazy. They found any excuse to not pay you bonuses and were incredibly dishonest with customers and wanted us to be too. \n\nIf anyone has credit cards with a bank that starts with a B, with a CEO who recently stepped down over his relationship with Epstein, look over your statements very carefully. If you call to waive fees know that they can always waive up to 3 months of late fees without permission, but you have to ask! \n\nThat\u2019s one of the ways they would fuck with us. If we did it without the customer asking,  we would get in trouble. You bet your ass once I gave my notice, fees were being waived left and right, with no asking at all. It\u2019s one of the many reasons I left. You\u2019re welcome, to all those people! \n\nAnother tip, if you fall behind on your account and it\u2019s reported to your credit, no bank can ever just fix it as a courtesy, so never ask that. Always call in saying you never got your statement. When they ask you to verify your address give a different one than the one they have. I don\u2019t care whose address it is, use your mom\u2019s, friend\u2019s, whatever, just make them change it. You can change it back later on the website, after your next billing cycle and change it to paperless while on the phone. If you\u2019re on paperless, tell them they have the wrong email and give them a new one. We all have more than one, right? Once you do this you can then ask them to fix your credit report and they have to do it because now the reason you fell behind is bank error, not your fault. You can also ask to waive all associated fees, interest and late fees. \n\nAnother way banks fuck with you? When you sign up for a new cc they automatically sign you up for paperless billing, without your knowledge. This happens often with airline cards you open while on a plane. You automatically get charged an annual fee and you forget about it because you never get a bill and didn\u2019t charge on it. It goes delinquent and you call. The fact that you didn\u2019t pay is not a banking error, it\u2019s your fault, so too bad so sad you\u2019re screwed. To not pay the fee you can close the account but it will hurt your credit and we won\u2019t fix it either way. What do you do? Follow the steps above. Also always remember when you open a card. I\u2019ve seen this tank people\u2019s credit and because they didn\u2019t say the magic words to me I couldn\u2019t help them.\n\nI hated myself everyday because it pissed me off. I broke the rules often or tried to lead people to give me the right answers as much as I could, but I would get in trouble and didn\u2019t gaf. It was an amazing day when I gave my notice and so great when I was just waiving thousands in bullshit fees before I left. \n\nSo please everyone follow these steps and you\u2019ll really help yourselves. Also, always be nice to the person on the phone, no matter how long you wait. As much as my company sucked if someone was a huge asshole to me I did the absolute bare minimum. The really nice people, or even frustrated people who were still patient with me found that I was willing to go out of my way to help them in every way I could.",

First-line technical support is almost actively *disincentivized* from being technically competent. Your job is to adhere to the script, full stop. In a way, that makes sense, because the role of tier one support is almost never to actually solve legitimate service problems, it's to triage them out to second-level support and field the calls from the truly technically incompetent who not only haven't done a power cycle, but who *need to be walked through how*.\n\n\n\n&gt;being a technical person myself this was realllllly painful\n\nTry being the call center agent in those shoes \ud83d\ude01.

That's a firin'.\n\nProvisioning a static IP block for a home office customer *after* escalating it to a clueless tier 2 as was procedure?

You may be dealing with agents who don't have an option for transfer notes, or the agent has difficulty wording out your concern for the next agent, or a mix of both. Trust me, it's also frustrating on the agent's end to deal with this bs, not only bc of metrics, but when the customers get irate, it can be stressing. This is especially frustrating if the metrics demand you resolve an issue on call where a transfer or callback in a set period of days is discouraged and can be taken against you. If this happens all of the time when you have complex issues with the company you're contacting, they may have a handful of incompetent employees, or their system is just not designed with either your or the agents' performance needs in mind. Regardless of what most people think, but usually it's a matter of company policies and systems that screw people over. Just like with what Im dealing with now on my current job where they seem to not get the basics of an online chat function correctly, so much so that we've been months in development hell, causing customer interaction to be piss poor and metrics getting fucked sideways. \n\nI get why you're frustrated on those whose first language isn't English, but it can't be helped when US/UK/AU-based companies outsource to other companies, offering relatively high pay. With call demands soaring, it's impossible for BPOs to just reject applications or hold trainees until they're competent in English. The vetting process just isn't that meticulous. \n\nIn my country, where there are an absurd amount of BPOs, most new hires come from low income households whose educational backgrounds may range from high school dropouts to graduates. The educational and economical backgrounds can have rippling effects on English literacy. I was lucky enough to land a job despite being from a low-income houseld due to my being exposed to the English language early on in childhood. In the process, I lost the accent that most would attribute to my ethnicity. But others are not so fortunate for that. They try, but getting rid of the accent and mispronunciations is learned through years of exposure to the language.",

You can't let a customer, who's prolly calling you cause they're having an issue, after waiting in line for a long time, deal with an incompetent agent. It should never happen.\n\nThat UPS story really affected the way i viewed that company ngl. That was 3-4 years ago, and I never use their service ever again after that. It just left such a bad taste in my mouth the way they dealt with my whole situation.\n\nnowadays, im glad that the chat option for customer service is more and more prevalent. Things are just smoother that way for 80% of the customers and leave the call center for the more serious/complex issue. Language is rarely an issue in chat. There is written copies of everything. If i get transferred over to another agent, I can just copy my previous explanation and paste it to the next agent lol. I can do something productive while waiting to be connected to the agent. There's a ticket number that i can use to refer this interraction in the future if necessary. It's just so much better haha.\n\nI dont mind accents at all tbh. As long as i understand what they're trying to say AND they understand what im trying to say haha. mispronunciation of a word here and there is fine, but i dont know how to explain it, but sometimes the way things are phrased is also confusing. That's more problematic to me. Again, not blaming the agent, just the call center company or the actual company who outsource their call center. Take my UPS example, I should be able to contact the specific UPS store where i shipped my stuff, not some agent working in a call center 5000 miles away in a foreign country, who didn't understand the difference between Washington the state and washington dc the city for example.\n\nalso, based on your answer, it seems like you're in the know of the industry. If you don't mind, can you enlighten me on this cause It's interesting that you only mentioned US/UK/AU and not Europe. Is it true that they do not outsource their call center as much as the US companies? Prolly cus english is not their first language? im asking because ive dealt with several european companies' call center. And my whole experience was so so so much better. Based on my experience, it is easier to connect to a real person there, rather than in the US where it seems like you have to go through so many robotic prompt before you can get connected to a real person. The agent also seems more helpful and knowledgable? prolly cause they work directly for the company, so they know the products first hand?",

I can't stress enough where policies from the parent company can be misinterpreted due to poor wording or implementation across all locations and outsourced companies. \n\nI'm not exactly knowledgeable when it comes to the industry itself, but from what I understand, US, UK, and AU companies love outsourcing to other countries to cut costs. In my country, they particularly love doing it since our cost of living is relatively cheaper, and we have a history of being adaptable to the English language (what years of being colonized by Americans does to a mf). \n\nI don't know why other EU companies don't outsource their business. There may be some out there that I don't know about, but from the companies I've applied for in the past, the accounts/campaigns they offer are all US-based. Amazon, Chase, T-Mobile, Sprint (which I think merged with T-Mobile already) and PayPal are the only ones I can list off the top of my head. Though some of these companies do have EU counterparts, and some are handled by outsourced agents, I have yet to see an actual EU-based company outsource their business anywhere else. My take is that they like to keep it inside like their royals did in the past Habsburg-style lmao. Or maybe because other EU companies have better chances of having a competent customer service if they source locally instead of outsourcing to countries that may have only trained most of their employees in English. \n\nIn-home agents, generally, are more knowledgeable about their company's goals than outsourced ones, but in my previous job, we were given the same level of training as the outsourcing company's grunts. Superiors get training in the same level of superiors in-home. The only thing they don't outsource for are compliance and back office teams since those teams handle proprietary info. \n\nOn the topic of the IVR, or the robot, that's usually made to control traffic. Most companies do it as a buffer so they can route you to the next available agent. This usually is the case for companies that have high call volumes that the number live agents they have at any point in the day can't match the demand. Another reason is to deter you from contributing to the high call volume. This has two effects: it's either your concern is surface level that the robot, if programmed well enough, is able to resolve your issue in the span of time you stay on the line with it; or, you get frustrated so much that you'll just call another time, or probably never call at all. Either way, it helps the company reduce costs by hiring more agents, getting more equipment, etc.",

They act as a barrier of poorly trained people who often aren't able to help, which serves to waste the customers time, and many people like me will only carry on a conversation with one if it's absolutely necessary.  I'm going to date myself in saying this but I remember when call centers as they are today became a thing and no one was happy about it.  Sadly, our corporate overlords didn't give us any say in the matter because it trivially increases their profit margins.",

I was a teenager and thought god that repetition must be soul destroying, and it often is tbh.

Not to mention it was a financial account where rules tend to be really strict on what you can and can't do. \n\nSome people will stay on the line for hours on end when they can't have things their way, and it's so frustrating to be called out by superiors on something I couldn't control. Call control can be practiced for most callers, but there will always be outliers who will demand something of you and won't stop until they get you to do what they want. Luckily, I didn't have to go through ghost spiels when the customer hangs up, because it immediately routes me to another call. Unfortunately, my current job doesnt do that since we manage online chats and SMS instead. It takes a whole 10 minutes to end a ghost session because of the guidelines on sending \"bump messages\". \n\nThe worst thing to experience though is the racism some callers have. This is apparent with some American customers (don't at me, my BPO experience is with American accounts) where they'd ask you right off the bat if you're American or not. Luckily, I can get away with it bc I don't have a SEA accent (you guess which one) on call, but most of my former teammates do, and some of them get verbally abused for it. Not that it's not an occupational hazard we weren't informed of during training, but it's annoying when you're experiencing it first hand.",

That's enough to make a bad situation even worse for any person. But, it's not the minimum wage workers fault. They're just taking the call and probably had very little training too.\n\nAlso, if you truly get amazing service, then tell the rep. to transfer the call to their supervisor/ lead/ manager. Then, let the manager know how great they were.That also can make someone's day, potentially a factor in a future performance raise\n\nKeep in mind, these people are scheduled to be on the phones without many breaks.

That said when someone's typing and it shows the \"...\" we could see what you were typing before you sent it. Helps prep a few seconds sooner. \n\nSomething that's obvious if you think about it but I never knew for sure until I was on the other side.\n\nCareful venting your anger because even if you delete your text we still saw it :)",

I\u2019d mute myself and sit there and enjoy the silence for 2-3 minutes before I ended the call myself\u2026 where I worked we handled 100-120 calls a day a time. Back to back to back calls and they had a stupid red light when customers were waiting that would flash. It was exhausting, those 2-3 minutes were life saving at times because the moment you hung up, another customer would be put into your headset immediately.",

If calls were typically 3 minutes the management will aim for 2:30. It\u2019s the nature of capitalism to try to keep costs down.\n\nIf people call for less time management will just aim for smaller metrics.\n\nThe other points seemed mostly okay though.",

Then to be transfered to 2 other operators and you have to provide all the info each time and explain your issue",

    "postText": "Why YSK: I see people commonly calling drug dependencies addictions, especially in regards to things like coffee or sugar. While dependency can still be something you want to avoid, it needs to be seen as separate from addiction, which is a disease. \n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\n\"Substance dependence, also known as\u00a0drug dependence, is a biopsychological situation whereby an individual's functionality is dependent on the necessitated re-consumption of a psychoactive substance because of an adaptive state that has developed within the individual from psychoactive substance consumption that results in the experience of\u00a0withdrawal\u00a0and that necessitates the re-consumption of the drug.[1][2]\u00a0A\u00a0drug addiction, a distinct concept from substance dependence, is defined as\u00a0compulsive, out-of-control drug use, despite negative consequences.[1][2]\u00a0An\u00a0addictive drug\u00a0is a drug which is both\u00a0rewarding\u00a0and\u00a0reinforcing.[1]\u00a0\u0394FosB, a\u00a0gene transcription\u00a0factor, is now known to be a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions,[3][4][5]\u00a0but not dependence.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence",

            "comment": "I always have to point this out when talking to doctors and they ask about if I am addicted to a medication. If I go off my meds with I have withdrawal? Yes but I don't take more than prescribed and I don't take them for any form of high. Many medications cause dependency and shouldn't be stopped without tapering off but that doesn't make someone an \"addict\".",

I went in to the ER for a stomach ulcer (from an acidic diet) and my doctor tried to blame it on me stopping anxiety medication.... over a decade ago when I was 13. Took those pills for maybe a month or two in middle school. Still can't go to the hospital without them bringing it up and asking about it, despite me not once having anxiety symptoms for that many years.",

I was sent home with an intestinal infection that landed me back in the ER with blood poisoning. I understand that often some of my meds are abused by people and that most addicts won't admit addiction but I tried to explain to this ER doctor why I was sure it wasn't withdrawal and that I didn't abuse my meds but he just heard meds assumed addiction and his mind was made up. It really is a situation where as smart as doctors can be they are just humans making educated guesses and won't always get it right but proper usage of terms could help. One of my meds causes severe mood swings and explosive rage in me if I don't taper off. I only found out because the CDC shut down a doctor on me and left me hanging with no idea what was going on and no place to go to make sure my health was taken care of.",

I told the doctor \u201cI have lupus. I have lupus nephritis. I\u2019m having a flare, you need to check my kidneys\u201d. He didn\u2019t order a single urine test or test pertaining to lupus rheumatology kidney disease or autoimmune disease. Any single one would have shown I didn\u2019t have the flu and needed to be admitted. He Told me in as much as two minutes that I had the flu and he was sending me home. \n\nI was admitted the next day by a doctor who said he recognized I was having a severe flare bc his sister had lupus. \n\nA doc like the first one should recognize he doesn\u2019t have the relevant knowledge to test for or evaluate my disease and if he believed I had the flu still needed to consult with the rheumatologist on call to offer input and tell him what tests to order. I\u2019ve had er docs tell me \u201cI\u2019m consulting with rheumatology and they are the ones making all the decisions about your care now\u201d as it should be. I wish I had understood as much that first time so I could have demanded that doctor consult with the rheumatologist on call before sending me home. \n\nIn the er they have access to consult with basically any type of specialist you could need. If you sense your doctor is incompetent and are trying to work yo ur way up that chain of command you mentioned what you want to demand is a consulting specialist.",

There was no way for them to know, almost any time a parent is frantic and a kid seems fine the child isn't seriously injured.",

The whole diagnosis happened really quickly and without much psychological evaluation, so I have some doubts. Maybe I just got lucky, but anxiety isn't something that normally just goes away like that. \n\nFun fact, in the same year I was also diagnosed with ADHD and depression, and they tried giving me mess for all of em. Strong stuff too, big doses of Ritalin and Adderall and stuff. I think I was just a troubled kid and they tried every pill in the book. Every single one just sorta made me feel like shit. Now over a decade later I don't have any prescribed meds and I'm in a very good place. These meds help a lot of people out, but evaluation and proper diagnosis is really important",

I figured out in 2005 that opioids work best for me, wasn't continued on them when I was approved for VA healthcare in 2008, and then spent the next 2.5 years trying so many other drugs before my PCP would approve opioids. She's been my (awesome) doc for 15 years now, and she's never once tried to change my meds since. That's part of my concern in getting a new doc, especially with a very limited ability to choose who I see. Based on my experience with the VA, something tells me that if the new were to start pushing to try non-opioids and I were to request a new doc based on now wanting to deal with that, my record would reflect something about \"refused treatment for probable opioid addiction\" and everything would go downhill from there.\n\nMy former VA psych doc put in my record something like I \"have an abnormal aversion to and belief that [I] can't take medications daily.\" While it is true that coming from a family with addicts I don't like taking anything every single day, will refuse any highly addictive drugs I *have* to take daily to be effective, and also know my ADHD self well enough that I will regularly forget to take meds whose efficacy requires daily dosing, what's extremely fucked up is that he wasn't referring to any reasonable medication suggestions - he put that in my record after I turned him down *again* for medications that are well-documented for making people on both sides of my family suicidal. Apparently, not wanting to risk highly probable suicidality is an \"abnormal aversion\"; who knew?\n\nKinda funny you mentioning trying different meds, because while I was the one who asked to try a different anxiety med, my (new) psych med provider is the one who was very passively insistent on swapping to one in an entirely different drug class. I only use them situationally/conditionally and just wanted to try a different benzo after the one I'd taken for ~10 years started giving me next day headaches, but she was only interested in trying non-controlled substances. I had almost the same thing happen with Ritalin after years of taking it, and when I swapped to Dexedrine the headaches stopped.\n\nMy recent reaction? Happened on an antihistamine commonly prescribed for anxiety, at half the dose typically used. We've emailed back and forth since, but after the 5th alternate med suggestion (that I've either tried, know wouldn't work, or don't fit my need) I said I'd just go back to dealing with the headaches.\n\nIt is absolutely exhausting, and what sucks is that with the opioid crisis, addiction, and shitty drug-seekers, I don't even blame doctors for trying to be prudently cautious.",

It is reckless at best that they can just stop a doctor from caring for patients, not tell those patients anything about why and leave those people without proper medication. I had no idea if my doctor had been killing people, selling under the table did I need to be concerned for my health and well being? Nothing just sorry he can't see patients bub by. I was lucky that my general doctor was able to get me right in and let me know I had nothing concerning going on and take care of me short term while I found another specialist. Physical dependency is not always addiction and is not a sign of a medication being dangerous or misused. It is a byproduct of our bodies adapting to a chemical being introduced that we need to fix a problem.",

I did have to learn though, at first I waited until I couldn't stand it then took meds and that never worked I also tried to let the meds do all the work and that won't work. Learning to let the meds help me do the things I need like core strengthening keeping moving and strong while not waiting so long I can't function no matter what meds I try took a lot of work with a doctor to find and learn. I think of it like pushing a car if it comes to a complete stop it takes way more to get it moving than if you can keep it moving all the time. I have been doing core strengthening and stretching and staying active because it helps as long as I moderate what I do and listen to my body as well as follow what my doctor tells me (medication included). Until I found a good doctor my plans had always been make sure my son didn't have to move back in with his mom and when he turned 18 I was done with life. Proper doctors care made it so that I haven't thought suicide was the only way to end my constant pain. I know what you mean I like to think I am fairly tough but everyone has a limit and being miserable 24/7 isn't anything anyone should have to live with.",

It took me several years to find a doctor who really listened to me. I did several rounds of physical therapy and tried different therapists. The strengthening made no difference because all of the issues are from damage to nerve roots from the spinal cord. I'm strong enough to do most things. It's whether I can withstand the pain that decides what I do and how much. \n\nI wish you all the best with your issues. Don't give up! My DMs are open.

I took Norco exactly as prescribed for over 8 years in order to function with chronic pain whose cause was documented and proven qith multiple tests by multiple specialists.\n\n5 years ago I was forced to taper and stop taking it due to doctors refusing to prescribe it anymore, due to fears of addiction. I had taken it for all those years exactly as prescribed due to liver and kidney issues from overuse of otc medications before that. Now I am much less functional and having liver problems again because I am having to rely on  OTC meds again. It's so frustrating.\n\nIt's insane. When my mother was 80 years old and suffering with post-polio sulyndrome her doctor tried to take away her norco due to fear of addiction as well. She was elderly, permanently in a wheelchair and in constant pain - who cares if she IS dependent on the medication anyway, at her age and in those circumstances?",

Until that happens we have to do something and addiction prone medications are all we have. The idea that stopping their prescription solves the problem is optimistic at best. The flood of illegal drugs and their recreational use isn't going to significantly slow because we force great grandma to suffer for the last few years of her life. I understand the idea of trying to keep people from misuse but even addicts are better off with doctor supervision than using street drugs. A good doctor and proper screening and care won't be fooled that often for that long by a drug seeker and those crooked doctors that over write without care are very few.",

This is why I think even someone using recreational would do far better being monitored and slowly tapered off it will still suck but you don't have to be nearly as strong willed. It is amazing what your body can do to you to make you give it what it wants.",

You continue using despite negative consequences. Whereas dependence is just the fact that when you stop, there are withdrawal affects. They are not mutually exclusive. \n\nBasically, drug addictions almost always have a physical dependency attached to them. You are dependant on the drug and if you stop you will get withdrawal, but that is not why you continue using them. You continue using them because you have an addiction. Not because of the withdrawal symptoms which are caused by your physical dependency. \n\nAnd then you can have a physical dependency that is not attached to an addiction. You could drink coffee every day and when you stop, you'll get a headache. That is because of a dependency on caffeine. However, it is not an addiction. You are not continuing despite negative consequences and you CAN stop yourself, despite that it will give you a headache.",

Someone can experience the negative effects of coffee and decide that they're not that bad without necessarily being addicted. An addict will ignore them and continue using at any cost.\n\nI think the big question is how far a person will go to get it if it's taken away. I don't know that I've met anyone that would spend their rent money on coffee if it came down to it; people absolutely will do that for cigarettes and addictive drugs, and that's what makes it an addiction; they will overlook any harm to their health and life to keep using, as their brain thinks it's equally important to water or air for their survival. Everyone does have their limit, but a non-addict will stop as soon as a real need presents itself. It's also why you can't force an addict into rehab and expect it to work; they have to want to stop.\n\nThanks for posting this, OP. It's an increasingly important point.",

With addiction, they tend to be life-limiting, such as poor work performance or relationship problems. Whereas a narcoleptic might choose a racing heart rate from Adderall over falling asleep at work, an addict might continue taking Adderall *in spite* of poor work performance. The difference is that addiction alters your priorities, whereas with narcolepsy the decision is more conscious and rational.\n\nIt's hard to tell the difference sometimes. I used to be addicted to Adderall but when I stopped, I lost a lot of my functionality. Some of the negative consequences were worth it, and some of them weren't.",

Sometimes people self-medicate but due to irregular dosage (% of caffeine in coffee), they can have negative side effects. \n\nI use caffeine to help manage migraines. If I don\u2019t use caffeine during aura phase, I get a migraine. But the goal is minimum caffeine for maximum efficiency. This is harder to do if you\u2019re using natural sources versus pharmaceutical ones (ex: willow bark versus aspirin). I usually slowly drink a caffeinated beverage until I begin to feel relief, and I avoid caffeine intake if I don\u2019t have auras. \n\nBut if someone were to keep using caffeine to self-harming levels? That would be addictive behavior. You can see it in more minor physical self-harm too: chewing nails or picking skin to bleeding. It\u2019s directly harmful but it gives a positive feedback loop, so people keep doing X Thing regardless. So if you drank coffee despite it causing tachycardia, because you like how it feels, and you feel compelled to continue\u2014that\u2019s addiction, from my understanding.",

Alcohol (or somewhat similar, benzodiazepines) is one of the few substances where withdrawal can kill you if you are addicted, and therefore it is medically necessary to have medication to help safely taper and get into a healthy place\n\nIts controversial to some, but the same applies with amphetamines - ADHD is a neurological disorder, and Adderall is one of the most effective and studied drugs in history, for ADHD and other uses. we've studied it since the 30's *at least*. It's an effective medication that many people are dependent on to function in society. \n\nMethamphetamine however (tho *also* occasionally used in severe Neurodivergent dysfunction), is usually  a drug of abuse. And I don't care what anybody says, the two are different- biologically, chemically, and culturally. There is no morality to these substances, and they can be used safely and effectively, without abuse. Or not\n\nA college student pounding Adderall to finish their essays is abuse. A college student taking Adderall to function and pay attention because they have a neurological disorder, is effective and responsible medication dependence \n\nEdit: words",

Because that release of chemicals is therapeutic to an underlying issue. \nExamples would be: ADHD, PTSD, bi-polar, depression. \n\nThat\u2019s why the most successful treatment methods always include psychotherapy in one form or another. Brain has to be reprogrammed.",

So many news headlines or comments on the internet \u2018fck fentanyl!\u2019 \u2018Evil drug!\u2019\n\nYeah, if you misuse it. \n\nSo don\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s a critically necessary drug to treat people and animals who have legit medical concerns. If you had cancer, or in pain, or needed general anaesthesia; I assure you, you\u2019d be begging for the fentanyl. \n\nIf you\u2019re using recreational drugs, I highly recommend you test what you take so as to be certain it isn\u2019t laced with a lethal dose of fentanyl. It\u2019s only common sense; you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re buying from and where it came from. Whatever \u2018pill\u2019 you\u2019re popping or coke you\u2019re snorting isn\u2019t FDA regulated; so it\u2019s pretty ignorant of you to just shove whatever into your body. \n\nIt\u2019s tragic the lives that have been lost. But it\u2019s not fentanyl\u2019s fault. You took the mystery drug. You took a dumb risk. Be angry at the cartel. Be angry at the government for fostering such a drug culture. If you\u2019re going to choose to take such a high risk and ingest unregulated substances. \n\nBe smart. Get a testing kit.",

                    "comment": "So much of this part isn't understood by most people. The way fentanyl is being used as a common \"evil\" in the drug community and it is true in the way that it is used as a cutting agent and being sold as not fentanyl. The drug itself is amazing for what it needs to do for the people that need it, but the deception behind it is what that \"evil\" is.  So it comes down to knowing who is making your drugs, and if you don't/don't want to know/ you should not know that information (please don't falsely accuse truthful drug dealers because false positives do exist and those dealers should have to prove with better tests at that point) but in general: Get a test kit, or stop doing drugs. Which inherently that's the goal anyway but hey, drugs are fucking awesome. But you gotta be better than the drugs going into them to battle the demons we are capable of.",

You can have an addiction that isn't totally crippling, and you could have a dependency on a medication that will actually kill you from withdrawal if you stop, despite not being addictive.\n\nBeing able to diagnose addiction has and always will be a difficult task. The only tried and true way is to stop. Just be careful of any dependency you might have, as withdrawal can be very dangerous. But generally if you quit something and get through all withdrawal (if there is any) and are still having cravings or you are filling that high with other substances, you have an addiction.",

People with PTSD / trauma are susceptible as well, but for almost opposite reasons - someone has been overstimulated to the point where they are desensitized to \"normal\" forms of reward (perpetually numb seeking stimuli). \n\nBoth groups might need medication to function day-to-day (dependence), however both are prone to misusing substances to self-medicate beyond that (addiction).",

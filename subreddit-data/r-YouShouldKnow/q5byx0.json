    "postText": "Why YSK: You should be aware of the medical care that is available to you, as well as the potential costs. Knowing that your hospital bill may be covered if your financial situation is not ideal could make the difference between life and death.\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act mandates hospitals must provide a \u201cfinancial assistance policy\u201d that must \u201cmust apply to all emergency and other medically necessary care provided by the hospital facility\u201d in order for the hospital to maintain its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit. Seeing as 57% of all hospitals are non-profit, this policy applies to majority of hospitals. If you are uninsured, these policies are most likely to apply to you. However, even insured people can qualify in many situations. \n\nSimply search \" \\*name of hospital\\* financial assistance \" and go to the hospital's financial assistance page. Somewhere on that page there should be a document called \"Financial Assistance Policy\", and inside of that it will tell you the qualifying income for total coverage, as well as qualifying income for partial coverage. Please read it thoroughly to understand what you may or may not qualify for. For the most part this only applies to emergent, non-elective, and catastrophic care.. otherwise known as \"medically necessary care\". \n\nAs an example, the hospital closest to me covers my entire hospital bill if I make under 200% of the FPL, which would mean I have to make less than $25,760 if I was a 1 person household, or $53,000 for my family of 4. In addition they will offer partial coverage if I make under 600% of the FPL.\n\nSource: [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/financial-assistance-policy-and-emergency-medical-care-policy-section-501r4)",

AND the fact that we already DO socialize a major portion of our countries healthcare expenses is something A LOT of people hate to acknowledge.\n\nIn the US we spend MORE on public funded health care than most developed countries. But most of that is covering 1) the sickest individuals that insurance refuses, 2) the poorest individuals that can't afford any health care, 3) emergency room visits for people that are not sick enough to qualify, not poor enough to qualify, or too poor to actually be cared about in a meaningful way in our country and so the only care they can receive is when things have gotten so bad they HAVE to be seen or risk dying, so something that could have been treated for $50 or less, suddenly can cost $500-5000...which we as tax payers pay for.\n\n\nWe already have enough public funding that if we simply switched to preventative health care from our reactionary system we would cover almost all of the expenses, but it would take time to work through the back log of preventative care that has been neglected to catch up, and the presence of a pandemic certainly doesn't help, but it still would drive down health care costs.\n\nBut no helping people you don't know is socialism and that is TERRIBLE!!! On an unrelated note please donate to mygofundme!!! My \"insert relative here\" racked up some MASSIVE medical bills, it is what Jesus would want!!! (/s for any idiots on this last paragraph).",

But lots of the view of American health care being absurdly expensive is because the billing process is absurd and customer education is nil. For example I recently had some scans and the \u201cbill\u201d is like $8500. My insurance\u2019s negotiated price is something like $2200. If got the $8500 bill and called up the hospital they\u2019d probably be thrilled if tout offered to pay the insurance rate. Step one is to offer an absurdly modest payment plan. At that point you are making good faith negotiations to pay and in most (all?) states they can\u2019t put you into collections or sue you until that process is done. \n\nTo give an example, when i was a kid we went to visit family for Christmas and my mom wound up in the hospital needing surgery with a bill that would be about $91k in 2021 dollars. Because it was out of state far enough away they didn\u2019t have contracts with the hospital and wouldn\u2019t pay direct, so no negotiated prices.  Fortunately for us it was a family get together and everyone knew about it and that included someone who knew how this stuff worked.  We asked if that was negotiable and they said no. We offered them the  equivalent of about $25 a month to start. This got us over that hump super fast. The bill shrunk about 90% and got on a payment plan. That got us an invoice we could then get reimbursed for by insurance that they would actually pay.  It basically went from being a $90k liability to about $1k out of pocket.",

Imagine if I go to buy this $300 ~~couch~~ I\u2019m sitting on and the sales rep says \u201cooh that one is a little expensive. It\u2019s $90,000\u201d but if you happen to know about the In n Out secret menu and you know exactly what to say, the couch will be offered at $4,000. So some suckers are paying $90,000 over the course of their lives with interest and others are paying an entirely different amount just because they know the secret code words. It\u2019s a bad example because couches aren\u2019t essential but if it was something like a life saving heart transplant it\u2019s a lot more scary.\n\nEdit: it has come to my attention that couches are also sold in a scammy way in America. Let\u2019s say for this example that it\u2019s a bottle of water instead. One person gets told it\u2019s $4 and another gets told it\u2019s $90,000.",

Also it's not all hospitals, and there is a barrier there. But it also by no means that \"healthcare is technically free in the US.\" This is only for those who make below a certain threshold and only for catastrophic medically necessary care. Think car accident. If you are in a car accident type situation, and cannot communicate, medical services is taking you to the closest hospital, non profit or not. While yes, that is a form of healthcare, it is very far from all the healthcare someone would want in their life time.\n\n It's much less expensive on society in general to improve preventative care to catch diseases early and change habits or medicate. It is much more expensive to let a disease get so bad it requires a hospital stay and medication. To then get that person better, only to prescribe follow up medication or care. That may be unlikely to happen because it's not covered, and the patient then gets bad enough with that disease to require a hospital stay again.

Non profits will often also state it somewhere in the name or on the sign, so really you are looking for the lack of a non profit claim. Unfortunately, especially rural areas tend to be for profit since they can't sustain themselves as a non profit. \n\nMy local hospital is owned by Duke (along with most of the hospitals in surrounding counties) and is for profit. They refused to offer financial assistance after my son had surgery because I had insurance - just not hospital coverage. So I paid 100% out of pocket. They didn't care about my financial situation. \n\nBut it's still a worthwhile tip because I was able to get my entire hospital cost for the birth of my son covered at a non profit. I still had to pay for my ob, the pediatrician, and a few other people that were not directly employed by the hospital, but it really helped with my shitty insurance.",

Under EMTALA you\u2019re entitled to a medical examination, and if you have a medical emergency that requires treatment, they\u2019re obligated to treat you and (if needed) admit you to the hospital and provide an equal level of care.\n\nI only make this distinction because technically if you don\u2019t have an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d they\u2019re not required to treat you. If you go to the ER with abdominal pain and a CT scan shows you have pancreatic cancer, as long as you\u2019re stable and can wait a week for an outpatient oncology appointment, they\u2019re technically allowed to discharge you, even if you wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for outpatient cancer treatment.\n\nDoctors know this, and will bend the rules a little bit to make sure that patients get the treatment they need. I remember in med school I saw a patient in the ED, a young woman in her late 20s, who was undocumented and uninsured, and came in with unilateral vision loss that made us worried about Multiple Sclerosis. She needed an MRI, but was completely stable and *could* have been discharged to get the MRI as an outpatient\u2026 but we knew that since she didn\u2019t have insurance, if we discharged her she\u2019d never be able to get the MRI. So we admitted her instead, just so she could get the MRI and have it be written off with the cost of the hospitalization.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the same thing happen with surgeries as well. Patient has a renal mass that needs to be taken out, which is an elective surgery and can be done as an outpatient, but the patient doesn\u2019t have insurance, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to get it done after discharge. So instead we keep them inpatient to get it, knowing that the cost of the surgery will be written off along with the rest of the hospitalization.",

I even waited until my doctors office was supposed to open the next morning to see them first (as an ER bill can often be more than a regular visit/additional testing).\n\nIn the end I went to the ER because my doctors office forgot to switch off their answering service and I had class in the afternoon.  I wasn't able to get a straight answer from anyone what it was going to cost me, or if the ER I went to was even in network. \n\nLuckily it was, and my ER charge was only $300 bucks.

You could die if you are avoiding it for bills. Learn the ways to reduce a bill, and especially avoid an ambulance unless you really need one because they are private companies that are just there to make profit most of the time. They don't even need to actually give help besides the ride, and it'll still be a $900 cab ride.",

And then they'd check you out without telling you how much it all cost or even what you bought.\n\nNo one would allow that. It's insane. But now what if someone told you that all of it was being paid by someone else. You'd not care anymore what it all cost. It's not your money, right? Walmart could charge whatever they wanted. \n\nThis phenomenon is exactly what allows prices to get insanely high. There's effectively no competition between hospitals or healthcare providers over price, since patients don't know the prices and they know insurance will pay. Patients choose their provider based on how close it is to their home, how well friends recommend it, what school the doctor graduated from, and how \"nice\" the doctor is. Never is price a factor. Patients couldn't even know how to compare price of doctors, since the information is hidden. \n\nBut of course the intelligent person knows that *you actually are paying regardless*. Even if your employer pays 100% of your premium, you're still paying. It's still a portion of the value of your labor being used on that premium. And if you allow a hospital to overcharge you, then you pay again down the line since the healthcare insurance underwriter will use the recent costs of the employees at your company to determine next year's premium increase.\n\nThere is an uncomfortable and inconvenient truth that us Americans need to understand, which is that *we're partially to blame*. We allow the wool to be pulled over our heads. Silently, we let these hospitals and doctors fuck us over. And the hospitals and doctors let the medical equipment, academic institutions, and pharma screw them over. And the government lets all of this screwing happen.\n\nAnd then Americans scapegoat the insurance companies, because Americans are ignorant morons when it comes to this subject. They see big premium numbers and say \"See! The insurance is charging a lot so it must be their fault!\" Morons...",

They have private insurers and providers and mandate everyone have coverage while subsidizing the cost for the \"poor.\" So often, these discussions revolve around the least popular approach to Americans (banning private insurance as part of M4A), but the arguments fail to recognize that the same data saying socialized medicine is cheaper and more effective also says that the approach Obama and the Dems miraculously got done is the best amongst the European examples. \n\nWe're so close to getting this done in America ... we really are!

I was supposed to pre-plan the death of my unborn child?\n\nI've been fighting this battle for almost a year and now it's about to land on my credit report while I keep fighting the VA.

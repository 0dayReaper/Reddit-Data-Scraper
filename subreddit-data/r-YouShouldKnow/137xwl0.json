    "postText": "Why YSK: Concert ticket prices and fees are outrageous.  Live Nation has a week where tickets are $25 all in, no extra fees or anything.  The sale this year is from May 10 to May 16.  \n\n\nLive Nation does a Concert Week every year where tickets are $25 all in.  With the way fees are at most places it gets way to expensive to even go to one show.  I'm not affiliated with them in anyway, just been getting tickets through this promotion for a couple years now.  Normally I'd only be able to afford one show, but with this I'm able to basically get two for the price of one.  Googling Live Nation Concert Week will give you more details about your specific areas and venues. \n\nAgain, not affiliated by them in any way, just a person who enjoys concerts and loves a good deal even more.",

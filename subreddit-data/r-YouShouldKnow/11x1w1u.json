A higher dose may be administered as a result, which can potentially cause an unexpected overdose as the blocker leaves your system, drastically lowering your opioid tolerance.\n\n[Source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/naltrexone-oral-route/precautions/drg-20068408)\n\nEdits: (thank you to everyone for pointing these things out\u2014 I made this post near the end of my shift late last night and I should\u2019ve been paying closer attention!)\n\n-this post is in reference to BLOCKERS, as in full opioid *antagonists* (such as Naltrexone) and not partial agonists.\n\n-change to more reliable source.\n\n-to remove remark that opioids and non-opioids may not be administered together; I was misinformed.\n\n-Substance *abuse* disorder is also a typo, it should be substance USE disorder, but I can\u2019t edit that.",

Then I skipped days because the actually half-life of Suboxone is super long compared to most opioids &amp; opiates. If I remember correctly it's 72 hours, so it takes that long for half of what you took to be ineffective or leave the body. The Dr I used told me once I could go 2+ days without dosing the jump off would be easy and it was. I had low energy for maybe 2 weeks but after 7 years on, low energy was no problem.\nHope that helps! Good luck. I have kids now too and the fear of withdrawal WITH them definitely motivated me .",

Caused like thoughts of suicide and shit.I was easily able to get down to 2mg a day (from 32). But getting off 2 was hard.I floated around 1mg for a few months,and kept trying to space it out. Down to 1mg every 2nd day, then every 3rd day.It was a real struggle. Eventually I wound up going on a road trip,and after about two weeks I was over it.\n\nBut I must say, it was no easy task getting off sub.\n\nHonestly best advice I can give is weine down to 1 or 2mgs a day then take a fkn vacation for a week or two. Fly somewhere. Hopefully that will work.\n\nThe physical withdrawl of 1 or 2mgs a day was null.Maybie a touch of insomnia.No biggie. It was the mind though that it really messed with.So you need to do something out of normal routine I think.",

In all reality I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t let anything affect my daughters life, and that I\u2019m likely not giving myself enough credit, but there\u2019s always that \u201cwhat if\u201d.  The only thing I know for sure is that I\u2019ll never touch drugs again - That, I\u2019m not worried about. Not even slightly. \n\nIt\u2019s the 1-2 weeks that I\u2019ll be out of commission or in withdrawal, and potentially even longer than that due to mood swings or depression. Really I\u2019m just a coward and refusing to face my fears, but I feel like I can justify feeling that way given how different (and amazing) my life is now because of these meds",

It's not a race, and if done slowly and gradually enough, you won't feel much of anything (nowhere close to the withdrawal you're scared of! It wasn't for me anyway)  \nI didn't mean like your Dr made money off of you particularly, but having that monthly or bi monthly apt definitely does get them paid..... so the incentive is 2 fold to keep you coming in regularly, and also addiction is a bitch and never goes away, so keeping yourself on mat. Meds will keep you clean, but also dependant on your meds..... it's far better than addiction in every light, so I understand fully why you don't want to mess with a good thing!!! And you don't need to unless you want to !! Don't let anybody tell you you are not clean or doing what is best for you because only you know!!!",

While buprenorphine isn't an antagonist, it only partially activates the opioid receptor to stave off withdrawal, and strongly binds to the receptor.  It will essentially make other opioids give you less of a high.  If you have been on it (or naltrexone) for long enough, your tolerance for the drug (how much you can safely take) goes down, so doses of morphine or other opioids that you used to be able to take safely are now potentially deadly for you to take, and overdosing becomes a real possibility\n\nThis is true whether you are administered an opioid for medical reasons or you relapse.  Everybody with opioid use disorder needs a naloxone prescription (the short acting life saving medication that reverses opioid activity) just in case there is a relapse; you should keep it on you at all times if you can.",

I can tell you for certain that your tolerance of opioids does NOT go down after being on suboxone for several years. I know because even after several years I could not get high from taking even larger doses of pain pills so I graduated to heroin to break through the suboxone. Even then I began my heroin addiction at the same dose a long time heroin user would need to get high. In fact even years after stopping suboxone my opioid receptors are permanently fried from it &amp; even after periods of total abstinence my tolerance has never reset. I have heard the same thing from every suboxone user I have ever met. They give doctors such ridiculous inaccurate information and then you go disseminate this sh*t to your patients and the public!!! And trusting our doctors we take your word as gospel!! Suboxone is the devil. It didn't just fry my receptors. It did damage to other parts of my brain!! Do your own research man!!! It's reckless and it's irresponsible to spew inaccurate information being sold to you by pharmaceutical companies! Was your \"class\" given by someone representing the manufacturers of Suboxone?",

This is done by a combination of making less receptors for the drug and also changing how the drug binds to those receptors.  This is why tolerance develops to drugs in the first place: you need more of the drug in your body for your brain to sense that it is there and cause the effect.    \n\n\nWhen you stop using a drug, slowly the brain will change its chemistry back to the way it was before.  The receptors in the area the drug works become more frequent and bind to the drug more sensitively, so that the brain \"sees\" a higher concentration.    \n\n\nAll this is a bit of an oversimplification, but is essentially how the drug works.    \n\n\nThe problem here is that opioids work on many different areas of the brain; some areas suppress pain, others give you a high, some cause constipation and nausea, etc.  All these receptors achieve tolerance at different rates, but the one we are concerned about is the one in the brainstem, which causes your brain to want to breathe.  This one achieves tolerance VERY fast and loses that tolerance just as quickly.  This means that if you stop using a dose of opioids for some reason and decrease the dose for some time, and then go back up to that dose again suddenly later, it can surprise you with how much it causes your body to forget to breathe.  This is what kills people who use heroin and other opioids... They take too high a dose (almost always unintentionally) for their brains to handle and just, stop breathing.    \n\n\nSuboxone will do exactly what you say and block the effects of other opioids from working because it binds VERY strongly to the receptors and knocks the other opioids off, but it doesn't actually cause the same effect in the brain and will do so at a lower dose.  In effect, it will ruin your high.  But if you take suboxone for a long time, and then come off of it for a long time, THEN go back to your old dose of heroin (or fentanyl, or oxycodone, or whatever) when the suboxone isn't present in your body anymore, your brain will be potentially much more sensitive and it can cause you to overdose.    \n\n\nNow, if you slowly ramp back up again, you probably won't overdose immediately, and if you were ramping up while you were still on suboxone, it makes sense why you didn't really notice any effects from smaller doses.  You probably saved your life doing it that way actually!  And if you were already back up to a high dose of heroin by the time it fully washed out of your body, it would explain why you never had good effects from small doses again... You already ramped your tolerance back up.    \n\n\nEvery body works somewhat differently, of course, and I've been in medicine long enough that I've learned that nobody \"reads the textbook\" completely, so I can't be sure that is what caused your experience, but the fact remains that going straight back to your old dose of heroin after being on Suboxone (or ESPECIALLY Naltrexone, which is what this post is actually about) is very dangerous, as is having a healthcare professional administer high doses of opioids to you for pain control.  That's all I was trying to convey with this reply.",

You said after being on Suboxone for a long time your tolerance goes way down.  That is patently false. But if you misspoke then I'm glad we can at least agree that your tolerance for opioids will not go down after being ON Suboxone. But yeah I've been an addict for 15+ years and you don't need to explain how Suboxone works or the mechanisms of receptors and tolerance to any opioid addict. And u def don't need to mansplain to one either. Every opioid addict is already well versed bcuz as soon as we started having to take higher and higher doses of the drug to try and get the same effect and r addiction started to bcome unsustainable we want to try and see if we can hack our tolerance in some way. Every addicts dream wud b to reset r tolerance after each use so that we would never have to raise r dose, run out of pills or drug seek just to stay well. But thanks anyway doc. I'm telling you from personal experience tho and based on the anecdotal experience of every suboxone user I have ever personally met, ur receptors don't reset like they do after abstaining from other opiates. I have had long period of sobriety without any MAT and my tolerance has not reset even several years on from my use of  Suboxone or other opiates. I'm not posting this so someone goes and slams a gram of heroin right out the gate after stopping their Suboxone, but I'm posting this to warn people of the potential permanent side effects of Suboxone and to call out Drs like urself who sell their patients on this drug after taking a \"course\" from the people who manufacture it without doing any other research &amp; so they essentially don't know a damn thing about it!",

If a patient takes around 8 mg or more of Subutex/ Suboxone, they will not feel any opioids for the next 24 hours or so. You could slam 3 grams of fentanyl, it wouldn\u2019t do anything. Buprenorphine has an extremely high affinity for opioid receptors and that means it fully blocks all other opioids. \n\nNaloxone is in Suboxone simply because Purdue, the company that created it, had a patent on buprenorphine which ran out. So to create a \u201cnew\u201d formulation, they mixed it with naloxone and claimed it couldn\u2019t be abused. (Which was a lie; people inject soboxone everyday, and buprenorphine\u2019s far greater abundance in the drug compared to naloxone makes it not an issue whatsoever.)\n\nEdit- I totally misread your comment my bad!",

Opioids might be fully blocked at the time a patient is admitted, and a few hours later the patient may be subjected to a dangerous amount of opioids as the partial agonist wears off. But Subutex/ Suboxone lasts a long time, so I\u2019d guess it wouldn\u2019t be an issue generally speaking. They\u2019ll learn your prescription history before it stops taking effect.",

It is really just a term that some clinicians decide to use interchangeably to describe the spectrum of substance use disorders but the DSM feels that just like saying substance abuse, it comes with a negative connotation. In the realm of substance use, the DSM does not use addiction as a diagnosis or diagnostic term. Substance use disorder is classified on a spectrum from mild to moderate to severe. Certain schools of thought say that a severe substance use disorder is equal to an addiction, but the DSM specifies in the latest edition.\n\n Per the DSM-V: \n\n\"Note that the word addiction is not applied as a diagnostic term in this classification,\ralthough it is in common usage in many countries to describe severe problems related to\r compulsive and habitual use of substances. The more neutral term substance use disorder is\r used to describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to a severe state of chronically \rrelapsing, compulsive drug taking. Some clinicians will choose to use the word addiction\r to describe more extreme presentations, but the word is omitted from the official \rDSM-5 substance use disorder diagnostic terminology because of its uncertain definition\r and its potentially negative connotation.\"",

The relief lasted long enough for the procedure to put a stint in a blood vessel. Neither my wife nor I had a chance to tell anyone that I was taking subs.",

They give local anaesthetic in the form of lidocaine, which I don\u2019t believe is affected by opioid blockers. It\u2019s different mechanisms. \n\nOnce the Transcathater is in your blood vessel it doesn\u2019t hurt. And once the blockage is cleared, whatever pain or discomfort you were feeling should\u2019ve been alleviated immediately. \n\nSo I don\u2019t see why you would\u2019ve been given opioids anyway. I wasn\u2019t. Maybe you did, I dunno. You can always ask or request the full transcript of every drug you were given, what dose, what happened listed in detail and a recording of everything said (all procedures are recorded; there are microphones above the table in the operating theatre). \n\nI\u2019m just talking my experience, I\u2019m not acting like I know everything and criticising your experience. Hope you\u2019re well.",

Addiction absolutely does hurt people, and I sincerely hope you heal from that. \n\nI deserve to live, as do all addicts, and I\u2019m not about to dignify your argument by explaining myself further. Addicts deserve to live and get well, full stop.",

People on these medications (opioid antagonists) are in recovery\u2014 they are not using and cannot use. You have to detox before you can even go on them. \n\nThese medications keep people sober. They just also nullify certain pain management in the instance of an emergency.",

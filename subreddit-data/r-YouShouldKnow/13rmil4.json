    "postText": "Why YSK: Some people with illnesses treated by SSRIs have life changing results, including unwanted changes to their sex life. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine that can block the unwanted sexual side effects of SSRIs, like anorgasmia, when taken 1-2 hours before intimacy. It can also block your SSRI, making your medication less effective. For this reason it should be used sparingly. Your doctor can help you define what that means for you.\n\nMy anecdotal experience: After discussing it with my doctor, I limit my use to 2-3 times per week. I haven't experienced any side effects from Cyproheptadine or noticed a change in efficacy of my SSRI, Lexapro.\n\nI'm not a health care professional, just a woman who thought I'd have to choose between having orgasms or having the will to live. Turns out I can have both, and I hope you can, too! Cyproheptadine is not effective for 100% of people, and for me it's not effective 100% of the time. Still, it helps me tolerate and stay on the medicine that best manages my mental illnesses while still having a fulfilling, though somewhat unpredictable, sex life. \n\nEdit to add: there are other options you should try before cyproheptadine since it can make your meds less effective. U/0wnzlf3 and u/retroviridae6 have some good additional info and context in the comments below, but I don't know how to link to them. Point is, tell your doctor about your side effects. There are options! \n\nSome sources: \n\n[Cyproheptadine treatment of sexual dysfunction induced by serotonin reuptake inhibitors](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8665544/)\n\n[Antidepressant-Induced Sexual Dysfunction: Five Management Strategies](https://www.consultant360.com/content/antidepressant-induced-sexual-dysfunction-five-management-strategies)\n\n[Cyproheptadine: a psychopharmacological treasure trove?](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/cyproheptadine-a-psychopharmacological-treasure-trove/4D1A2DAD89BC07379E6C7D23A9AC5ADF)",

While on SSRI's, it got worse to the point of maybe eating twice a day, but most of the time only once. Far too many variables to assume it will/won't cause an increased appetite. Only saying this so others aren't too dissuaded by it.\n\nI will say this, and it's likely a low chance, but if anything has the potential to cause brain zaps, just know that it was the most horrendous 5 day experience of my life.",

I want to have sex! Its such a huge mind eff to mentally and emotionally want something, but my body isnt picking up on any signals and just all..NOPE!\n\nMy dr cut down my lexapro and added wellbutrin, I was scared to go off the Lexapro cause it really helped me so much when nothing Id tried before did anything...but then, after a couple months I was like nope, I cant handle it anymore, so she took me off Lexapro completely and upped my Wellbutrin to full dose.  Within a few weeks I was totally back to my normal self....which was a HUGE relief, cause that conflict was really messing with my head.",

We use cyproheptadine to block the effects of SSRIs in cases like Serotonin Syndrome. \n\nThus, while cyproheptadine may be beneficial it is not a first-line treatment for the sexual side effects caused by SSRIs. \n\nThe really big YSK: Don't take medical advice from people online (including me).

I actually don't want to think about it because, for better or worse, the person I was and the life I was leading don't exist anymore. I would have gone back on an SSRI and taken as needed cyproheptadine at least a year ago if I knew it was an option.\n\nThat said, again, you're totally right, and anyone interested should talk to their doctor.",

You imply in your comment that you are in the medical field but your vague and incorrect assertion that there are \"treatment options available\" says otherwise.\n\nThe majority of us experiencing these side effects have to chose between sticking with a medication that keeps us alive yet destroys us emotionally, or switch meds and end up possibly hospitalized (as was the case with OP) or dead. That's not an \"available treatment option.\"",

I'm in my last year of medical school, about to be a physician. \n\nSecond, both sildenafil and tadalafil are options for women for anorgasmia. Switching medications is an option. There are numerous different SSRI and SNRIs to try. Buoroprion can help with decreased libido. \n\nNow, none of these may work for you. That does not mean they are not treatment options. Some people's depression is refractory to pharmacological management - that doesn't mean SSRI's are not a treatment option for depression. So, too, just because sildenafil or buproprion doesn't work for you that doesn't mean it isn't a treatment option. \n\nI am sorry that you are experiencing these issues. I understand how frustrating they can be - how much they can negatively impact your life. I hope that you and your physician are able to find a treatment plan that works for you. Good luck.",

Lol. \n\nYou do know that only the first two years of medical school are hitting the books constantly, right? At the end of year 2 you have to take and pass the first medical licensing exam. Then for the next 2 years you see patients. \n\nIn fact, not only do I have over 3,200 hours of hands on clinical experience seeing patients, diagnosing them, developing treatment plans for them, I have many thousands of hours from my years of experience in healthcare before deciding to become a doctor. \n\nNow how about you? How long have you been a doctor? How many patients have you treated? How many patients with ssri-induced sexual dysfunction, specifically, have you treated?\n\nRight- none. So here's the thing: you don't know anything. You are not equivalently trained to me. You have not studied anywhere near as much as I have and you have no real world experience treating patients, as I do. So you are not qualified to debate with me. YOU need to go get an education. YOU need the real world experience with which to tell me that I am wrong and that the scientific/medical consensus is wrong. \n\nYou want to debate me? Go to medical school. But lets be real, you probably couldn't. Probably why you think education is not a credential lol.",

            "comment": "Seems like it would be incredible counterproductive to use this, or at least if you use it too much. Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that is sometimes used as treatment for SSRI overdose. Whereas SSRIs act to increase levels of serotonin, cyproheptadine blocks serotonin receptors, effectively blocking the activity of SSRIs\u2026 \n\nif you use this on occasion, its probably not the end of the world since the benefit of SSRIs is from repeated use over multiple weeks. However, if you take it frequently (ex. Every time you have sex) its plausible that you will be pretty much fully blocking the effect of the SSRI.\n\nI think a far better solution is to either switch SSRIs or adjust the dose. Just because you have sexual side effects with one agent does not mean you will have sexual side effects with others. \n\nAlso, bupropion is becoming more popular as a first line agent or an add-on because it is weight neutral and does not cause sexual side effects.\n\nSource: I am a doctor",

And some people don't have the option of switching meds since nothing else worked. Both are true for me.\n\nRelevant excerpt for those struggling from The Prozac Diary by Lauren Slater.\n\n\u201cOur sex life, huh?\u201d he said again. He stared at the ceiling. I stared at the ceiling. He looked into the fireplace, which behind its Italian tiles has never been usable, a stone cleft.\n\nOur sex is not cold. We are gentle and admiring\u2026 I confess, however, to feeling at times disturbingly distant. I know about the problems that can come with long-term intimacy, the blah sensation when you have traced every nook and link in your lover\u2019s body. Believe me, though, the distance of which I speak is different. It is physical. It is local. Boredom is diffuse and psychological. I am not at all bored by Bennett, but it is as though I have been bored into by something else, injected with Novocain at a very specific spot. I want to weep. Sometimes I picture my pelvis as a curved place filled with snow, snow bracketed by bones, eerily pretty in its northern whiteness, where the wind goes.\n\nOne day, about three years ago, two years into my relationship with Bennett, a comet was coming. I wanted to see this comet. I wanted to feel it flare in me. Scientists were saying its rail of rock and fire would glow in the dark night sky. It was not realistic, but I pictured this comet igniting me from the inside out, star heat in my mouth.\n\nI went outside. The day darkened. I remember the sunset was spectacular that evening, slow and sensual, like a fiery lady dripping into a blue bath.\n\nI lay on the grass and waited. Bennett brought my dinner to the lawn. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just repressed,\u201d he had said to me the other night, I who had trouble coming, I who could describe the sensation as nothing else but a delicate mold over my vagina, very thin, and teasingly pink, like the mouth retainers I once wore.\n\n \u201cI will figure this out,\u201d I had said, \u201dIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t enjoy you. I\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d \n\nBut if there\u2019s one realm where we want our peaks, it\u2019s sex. Stars. Comets. The yard where I lay was surrounded by trees. I stretched on the ground and waited. When the wind moved over me, I lifted my nightshirt to better feel it. Ten 0\u2019clock. Eleven o\u2019clock. Bennett leaned out a lighted window two stories above me and said, \u201cAll right now. When are you coming in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cForget it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s past the time. You missed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cno,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, insisting on fire and rock.\n\nAnd so I stayed there, stubborn on the ground, and as I as I did, and as the night deepened and the trees stood over me like human hulk I could not quite reach, I moved my hands over my bare stomach, letting my fingers mingle in the rough hair that peaks the public bone. And then lower, sliding one finger up inside of me, up and up, farther than I had ever gone, until at least I touched the tip of my uterus. I tapped on it once, twice, three times, moving the white wand of my finger like a fairy godmother, spelling myself, blessing myself- you shall be moist and you shall multiply; tulips will flow in your blood; each pulse of an orgasm will yield a golden coin. One, two, three, I counted, but I could tell, the wall on which I tapped was numbed, and above me Bennett turned the bedroom light off, and I waited all that night but the comet never came.\n\nSome people say sex is not important. My mother used to tell me that sex was something a woman put up with\u2026 I am not in agreement with my mother on this point. And it was after the night of the failed comet that I started to really tussle, up front and out loud, with the meaning of this specific thing Prozac had taken from me. To stay on the drug would mean, and continues to mean, that I accept myself as a less sexual being, I am not pleased by this. Even in anorexia I was honoring the centrality of sexuality, insisting with the blade of my body that flesh be noticed, that we grieve its diminishment, that we celebrate the proximity of its crimson innards. And those times, my God, all those jubilant juiced up raunchy times when I had made such good use of my skin- fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twelve, lying on my bed, a Sidney Sheldon book propped up on my prepubescent belly, wetness puddling at the base of my vagina, drawing the slickness out until I became a singular sensation, a crest. My God. I can recall my first orgasm at age eight, the sudden surprise of tipping over into new space, new muscles doing new dances, all of it. Through my sexuality I had always felt in contact with an essential self, something unalterably true and female.\n\nAnd now, the same old story. Lost and found and in the finding still more lost. The ultimate exchange, one essential self for another. On Prozac I have become a barterer, which is for centuries how civilizations have survived and flourished, and also faded.\n\nBartering works when the exchange is even and both sides feel enhanced. Here\u2019s the problem with the Prozac/sex trade-off. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s even or enhancing. After all, there is one thing everyone, from behaviorists with their little Skinner boxes to analysts with their leather couches, seems to agree on. A healthy human adult has a fully functioning sexuality, a sexuality that is not suppressed, repressed, or otherwise damaged. I know of no theorist, from Stack Sullivan and Freud to Horney and Lifton, who would claim it\u2019s ok to be, shall we way, dysphoric in the genitals.\n\nProzac is a strange pill for a lot of reasons, foremost this paradox in its powder. It is a drug hailed as extraordinarily successful in restoring millions upon millions of people to normalcy, and yet, according to the criteria laid out by the doctors who make these claims, on it most people fail in one of the most supposedly central arenas of mental health. A random flip through the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) reveals that loss of libido and sexual dysfunction are serious symptoms of several psychological diseases. How are we- no, how am I- to make sense of a pill that more or less brings me to mental soundness and yet, at the same time, turns me away from the lush lands of the sanguine?\n\nAnd here\u2019s another question. How to make sense of a pull that so severs the sexual from the sensual? Prior to Prozac I had always assumed one\u2019s sensual and sexual capacities were linked, linked in the cortex, linked in the limbs. We smell, we touch, we taste, we crest, we come. Actions and experiences inseparable. Prozac, however, has taught me that one\u2019s sensuality and sexuality are or can be cut. Koskava, my doctor, put it to me this way. \u201cProzac restores on the general level but punishes on the local level.\u201d I agree. Apparently I live on levels, and on Prozac I am less integrated as a human being than maybe I was before. This seems a shame. But let me pause for a moment to look closely at one of my disintegrated levels. Let me creep up from the crotch, swim through the cervix, twine myself around my spiky spinal cord. Let me linger in my fingers, feel the plush pads of my thumbs, and then higher, higher, to the unsheathed eyes, which are bits of naked brain made beautiful in the face. While I am punished I am also graced, and I want you, Bennett, to know, if you read this, which I\u2019m sure you will, that I love you in the physical. I love you as only a lover can. Less depressed, I am better than ever able to love your hair, which has blond lights in it, and your remarkable eyes. I love the smell of your skin,  and I love your chest with the disk of your nipples, and your thighs, striated with sweat, and your back and your breath while you are above me. This is the gift of response Prozac has given me, even if I cannot always fully, when you are above me, unwrap the binding ribbons.",

This is just one anecdote, but I've seen a teen be recommended a change to an antipsychotic based on the results from this test when what should have happened (and what later happened after discussion and switching providers) was to try another SSRI. I don't want to paint antipsychotics as bad or anything and they certainly do have uses in some cases of anxiety and depression. But it seems wrong to me to turn to these types of drugs when other options haven't been adequately explored. In this case the teen had been on one SSRI for two years that was no longer working well for them and they saw great improvement switching to a different SSRI. Antipsychotics have their own risks and symptoms and I do not like the way I see them so commonly prescribed to teens, sometimes based on these tests. I guess in summary I don't like seeing the results from these tests override what I would consider to be a safer and more logical standard of care (try more typical antidepressants before turning to an antipsychotic, especially in young people without psychotic symptoms).",

The first obvious barrier is that most people have trouble motivating themselves to stick to an excercise regimen in general, even when motivated. A depressed person is going to struggle even more. What do we do with depressed people that struggle to even do the basic tasks of getting out of bed and going to school or work? Hire someone tp whip them until they run around the block? When someone is mentally ill you have to meet them where they are. That often means people struggling to do the very things that would help them. I always recommend sedentary clients get physical activity but it is a delusion to think that they're going to start running a few miles everyday and cancel all our sessions and dump their meds because excercise cured their depression and their underlying problems. I'd love to see it though.",

            "comment": "I have been on almost every anti-depressant and not only do they not help me, (in some cases make me worse mentally) but I always get sexual side effects. If I\u2019m lucky to even get it up with such a low sex drive, it\u2019s impossible to orgasm so I\u2019m left disappointed in myself, and frustrated. \n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t even be on Wellbutrin to counter act it or switch to Wellbutrin entirely because I have Epilepsy and they trigger seizures. I\u2019m now off anti-depressants all together, and while I\u2019m still sick mentally, I feel a little better at least knowing I can perform a primal function such as having sex. I actually enjoy it, and have amazing orgasms now and I feel much better off. I found out I have BPD tho which explains why meds aren\u2019t very affective for me. I have major depression and generalized anxiety as well, but I think the BPD may make antidepressants less affective, but I really have no idea. Some clinical depressions are med resistant so that could be it as well",

It wrecked my sex life, thought i was ace, then gay, then ace again. It was a really painful experience - not to say that other orientations are 'wrong,' i just liked myself the way I was in that respect. \n\nIt's all over now, my life has gotten some normalcy but I can't help but feel there are lingering effects. Unfortunately this experience plus my experience with chainsmoking cigarettes on vyvanse have steered me away from medicating mental issues. Kicked the cigs years ago, yet still I'd much rather exercise, smoke some pot, and practice mindfulness habits. \n\nAnd pork my sadness away while I'm at it. I'm not badmouthing medication, I've just decided that I don't wish to pursue things using that avenue any longer - and that is just as valid as choosing to medicate.",

This is why it sometimes doesn't work at all. Also if your serotonin is out of balance(like too much), many side effects can occur, like sexual side effects. But too little also has sometimes devastating effects on humans. \n\nMuira Puama should works a bit similar to wellbutrin in action(yet different) and it seems to be a 5-HTa receptor antagonist.\nMP is used for sexual health. \nhttps://examine.com/supplements/muira-puama/research/\n\nIt helps me to feel better(function better as I have some mental issues otherwise) and seems to reduce side effects of some other supplements that affect serotonin, or something along the lines.

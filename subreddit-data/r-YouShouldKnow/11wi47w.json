If you receive a lot of unuseful marketing emails, it is often best to mark it as spam or delete without opening.",

I host my e-mail on a personal domain (you can do this with Gmail) and use a catchall, so if I sign up for something, I use \"annoying_company@example.com\" as my e-mail, and if I ever start receiving junk there, I can reject/spam every e-mail that comes to that \"box\" forever, and never hear from them again at my option.\n\nI used to use the subaddress thing (eg. you'd use \"yourname+annoying_company@gmail.com\"), but, sometimes they get wise to that and just remove the \"+annoying_company\" from their database, and then my actual e-mail address is out there.",

If you're purchasing anything, they can't share your credit card details, but you usually have to put in your first+last name and phone number, and they can share those.   So that makes it easy to tie all your one-time emails together.\n\nNow, speaking about web marketing in general, it's not that hard to track a specific browser across the web.\n\n**Info you give away:**\n\n* Even though your ISP doesn't provide a static IP address (unless you pay extra for a business account), your IPv4 address usually doesn't change until you reboot both your router and modem/ONT.  For \"normal\" people, all the devices in your house will share one external IPv4 address.\n* Even though your computer will periodically generate a new IPv6 address, the network prefix (first 56/60/64 bits, depending on how much your garbage ISP hates RFC 6177) will generally remain the same until you reboot both your router and modem/ONT.\n* Your rough location (ISPs provide the approximate location of every IP address, mostly for anti-abuse purposes)\n\n**Fingerprinting:**\n\n* The UserAgent string your browser sends (basically browser name + version) \n* Modern browsers support the &lt;canvas&gt; tag for drawing things in the browser window, with lots of browser-specific bugs/quirks (even different versions of the same browser).\n* A website can detect which fonts you have installed, which tends to be unique-ish\n* What features your have enabled (Java/ECMAscript, cookies, etc)\n* Whether you have adblockers installed (and which ones)\n\nThe combination of all the fingerprinting stuff is usually fairly unique in the world: No other person on your continent probably has the *exact* same combination of those attributes.\n\nYour best bet is to hide in the crowd by using completely stock (no extensions) Safari on the latest or next-to-latest iOS with iCloud private relay enabled.  All stock Safari on a given iOS version pretty much look the same, and private relay masks your location.  Also, use the privacy settings in Mail.app, which also use private relay.",

Making it even harder for you to be anonymous next time.\n\n\nFull transparency: I work on some of the software that powers this. I don't actually use the software so I'm not 100% on how it's used, but I know the capabilities.\n\nThe concept from a marketer's point of view is this: I want to know who is interested in my product.\n\nTypically it goes something like: a guest user is browsing my site. We can I fingerprint that browser and assign that person a unique identifier within our system.\n\nUser adds stuff to a shopping cart then creates an account adding PII (personally identifiable information -- this is the goldmine). That PII -- including email address and shipping address is now linked to that formerly anonymous identifier.\n\nThe user used a 1 time email so the company has no way to target them with more marketing.\n\nBut now it's a month later (or 2 years earlier. Doesn't matter) and, using the same browser used to make the purchase, the user likes the company's Facebook page. Or they create a separate account with the same shipping address.\n\nNow, that anonymous interaction has been linked. The purchase that was made using an anonymous account has been tied to a real person.\n\nThese interactions can get more complicated that this  -- especially given how few companies are actually involved and how tightly partnered they all are. But the net result is: any link that can be made between your anonymous online usage and your known online usage will be made -- a common browser, a common mobile device, a common social media or e commerce login. And once that link is made, it won't be unmade.  So the next time one tries to use a one time email from the same device or browser, it's too late -- they've already been identified.",

My company stopped doing it a few years ago due to GDPR/CASL and other similar laws. The reason being that people can't consent to an open being tracked, whereas for click tracking you can consent prior to clicking a link (as long as language exists telling you we're doing it, you can always choose not to click a link). For us we mail to people all over the world so we don't track opens anymore, but any US-only companies may still do so. But yes, not downloading pictures should prevent that, just know that if you click a link they'll still have a record of that (which tells them you opened it anyway).\n\nThat being said, I don't find it to be a big deal. It's not like we're getting personal information out of email tracking. It helps us to see whose interested in what we're sending, target mailings and lists better, etc. Ideally it would be used to mail you less of the things you're not interested in and more of the things you are. As far as data collection goes, it's completely benign.\n\nIf you're annoyed by too many marketing emails, the best practice is to unsubscribe, and not merely delete it. That actually has some legal weight to it - they do need to remove you and most emails these days have automatic systems for immediately removing you from a list as soon as you click the link. So always scroll to the bottom to find the unsubscribe language - it will always be there as long as it's a legit email and not complete spam. We have no way of knowing you're not interested if you don't tell us and we are legally required to stop mailing to you once you do.",

When you receive an email in the Mail app, rather than downloading remote content when you open an email, Mail Privacy Protection downloads remote content in the background by default - regardless of how you do or don't engage with the email. Apple does not learn any information about the content.\n\n&gt;\tIn addition, all remote content downloaded by Mail is routed through multiple proxy servers, preventing the sender from learning your IP address. Rather than share your IP address, which can allow the email sender to learn your location, Apple's proxy network will randomly assign an IP address that corresponds only to the region your device is in. As a result, email senders will only receive generic information rather than information about your behavior. Apple does not access your IP address.\n\n[source](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/ios-15-mail-privacy-protection-tracking-pixels/)\n\nSo what\u2019s actually happening is that the tracking pixel will be downloaded as soon as it\u2019s received in your inbox. The tracking pixel being downloaded is supposed to tell the tracker that you\u2019ve opened their email, but that signal becomes completely unreliable for apple mail users. This ends up not only ruins these tracking metrics for all Apple mail users, but also burdens the company by basically DDOS\u2019ing their servers with tracking pixel hits. \n\nThe company I work for does some email marketing and we\u2019ve found that tracking metrics from customers using apple mail is pretty much useless because of this, and we had to put checks in place so that our servers didn\u2019t crash when apple made this change",

Though I will add that open/click metrics are also often used to determine how many emails a specific contact receives from a brand. If you open regularly (or appear to open regularly because of your chosen email provider), some brands will take that as an invitation or ramp up their sending cadence for you. On the flip side, you might also get access to deals that way, like early access to major sales. But some brands do the opposite and target their unengaged recipients with their best offers in a last-ditch effort to retain them\u2026 \n\nMany brands pay for their sending platform by the contact and/or by the quantity of emails they send.

Some companies will track which types of subject lines have a higher open rate by you personally, and use that to determine which subject line options you personally get in the future.\n\nAlso-I used to work for a CRM company (like SalesForce but smaller and it was specifically designed for one industry).  One big selling point to clients is if they sent their email marketing out of our software, not only did we get the normal basic info like which customers opened the email, when, how many times, and if they clicked any of the links in the email, but if they DID click an email link we captured their IP address and then cross referenced the log we were keeping separately of every IP address that went on their website and knew what their website activity was going forward-what product pages they were looking at and when.  \n\nThis meant too that you could make first contact with somebody, mark them in your CRM as low interest because of the vibes they gave you when you talked to them, but you send them an email and they click a link and suddenly you get all the historical data and see they\u2019ve been on your website looking at one specific product twice a day for the last two weeks. You now know to mark them as a much higher interest level and market to them more aggressively.\n\nAnd of course, that means if you have a sale that seems like it went cold-the customer stopped replying to emails answering your phone calls and hasn\u2019t even opened an email in a while-you know they are still interested because you can secretly see that they are still going on your website and window shopping the item they were interested in.  You have all the info because they opened one email and clicked one link one time.",

A 'read' email is one that has been opened and listed in your client as having been read.\nAs far as deleting emails, most emails are not deleted, they are assigned a flag of 'deleted' and moved to another virtual 'folder', aka, 'Deleted'. Even if you go into the Deleted folder and empty it/delete forever, etc. They are still not truly gone; they are only gone from your view. There are backups, and in some cases, particularly those associated with business accounts, they are put on what is known as litigation hold, that is to say they are stored by the email provider to be made available in the case of an e-discovery subpoena.\nOn basically all free email accounts, your emails are yours in the same way a leased building is yours. You have a right to use it, but in the end the final say is belongs with the actual owner.\nThere are a few services in progressive minded nations that truly do not store your emails and do not have access to them. Protonmail is one of those service companies that provide truly secure email and actual complete deletion.\nDoes that answer your question?  \nEdit:  To address some people who just /have/ to have things excessively detailed, or so my source is not my asshole, here is a little more information.  The pixel is a single pixel that is loaded from a web server using what is called an HTML tag.  HTML tags are what amount to lists of ingredients in the recipe that makes the email or a webpage.  So, when someone opens an email, the tag is instantiated, the pixel requested and loaded from a webserver into your client.  The computer from which that pixel was requested (yours) is recorded on the webserver.  A reasonable analogy is purchasing something over the Internet, you have to supply the sender your address; same thing here.  What is being requested is a very small image, and the pixel-sender has to know where to send the pixel.  They are exploiting a foundational component of what allows the Internet to work, for marketing purposes.  \nIf you, at some later date, open a webpage with a pixel tag pointing to the same webserver, the webserver will say 'oh, hey, such and such a computer has touched this site before.'    This is not exactly the full detail and not written with absolute precision, but it is sufficient to give laypeople something of an idea of what this stuff is used for and how it is invasive.  To the couple of snide replies to my response, I will repeat; slag off.",

Please call me for your specific price, or just email/text if that works better.\u2019 \n\nDid that work? Fuck no, most people aren\u2019t that stupid to fall for it, but a very small percentage of people would be looking at the email and think, shit, I wonder what \u2018my\u2019 price is, especially if they\u2019ve been shopping and have a handful of different prices or even dealerships that wouldn\u2019t give prices. \n\nThe funny thing is how many people would call to complain that their salesperson hadn\u2019t even attempted a single contact and they wanted a $5k discount as a disgruntled customer. The manager would look and say \u2018well, our system shows 7 voicemails left over the last 48 hours at this number that you\u2019ve called me from, is that your current number? Oh, it\u2019s a friends phone that you are borrowing, and they didn\u2019t tell you about the messages? Ok. Well, they also sent 5 emails in the last 48 hrs to (imanidiot@moron.com), that\u2019s the email address you requested we email. Oh, of course, they must have all been routed to spam. I can confirm that all 5 emails were immediately opened, and the most recent one sent 10 minutes prior to this call, which is how you got this number I\u2019m assuming. I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t authorize what you are asking, but I\u2019m still happy to make you a deal, and if you are unhappy with your salesperson I\u2019d be happy to deal with you personally when you arrive, is 4pm fine for you or would 7pm work better?\u2019",

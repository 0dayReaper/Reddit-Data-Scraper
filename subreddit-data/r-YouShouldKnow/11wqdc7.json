    "postText": "Why YSK: As an ex-starbucks barista, we are not allowed to take direct tips from customers. The tips that go in the tip jar are distributed proportionally to all employees based on how many hours they work. If you instead give the employee a letter with their name on it, there is no way of deserning if it is money or a kind letter, so the worker can open the letter in the privacy of their home. This also circumvents the taxation on the tips. I cannot say for certain but I would assume that this would also apply to other companies that operate like this.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: When you ask people to help you move and waste a whole day on what should could be a couple hours work, you are wasting their time, which is usually on a weekend. Not cool. \n\nHere\u2019s what it means to me, and I think most reasonable people. All the rules get tossed in emergencies such as the case of abusive relationship move-ours, etc. We\u2019re talking normal, non-emergent moves here.\n\n1) BE PACKED: No one wants to sit around for hours and figure out how to wrap your little trinkets and cups/mugs or your antique dong collection. Have everything youre moving packed, wrapped, and in boxes. \n\n2) CLEAR THE PATH: Remove all trip hazards and obstacles so people are safe while picking up and moving your heavy stuff. \n\n3) HAVE A PLAN: Reserve the truck for when you are 98% sure you will be ready to quickly load up with the vast majority of your stuff. \n\n4) FEED THE CREW: Pizza is fine. Beer/beverages on ice are great. If you\u2019re planning on using your kitchen goods to do this, leave a few things out to support. Otherwise just use disposable stuff.\n\nMoving is very stressful and we all want help. Getting things ready so you can effectively use people\u2019s precious time makes you far more likely to get help again when you need it and sets a good example for when they need the favor returned.",

So over the summer, after my other roommates moved out (it was a 4 person dorm/apartment like place) I broke open my former rommate's empty rooms, and started stashing grocery carts I found in my complex. I then would put all my belongings loose for the most part in the cart. I did that move with 10 grocery carts and no boxes. Things like the bedding in one cart, and intermixed was my tv to protect it. \n\nI had a friend help me \"move\", who had never moved before. It was mostly her helping opening doors so we could push 2 carts through each trip.\n\nAfter we were almost done, she looked around and was like \"Uh, is this how people typically move?\"\n\nNO but it was the easiest one I ever did.",

I've had friends ask for help where I've showed up and they don't even have boxes yet, and I've had some where the only things to move are large pieces. My favorite was a friend who actually purchased new boxes from U-Haul. I don't know if he planned it this way, but those boxes stacked in the U-Haul from side to side, floor to ceiling perfectly. You couldn't fit a pencil between anything. That was pretty satisfying, packing everything up so nicely. I'd help him move again in a heartbeat. \n\nI also talked my brother into moving once. They hadn't set a date yet, but had purchased a new home about 3 blocks from their current home. We were all hanging out, had a bunch of guys and a truck there, so we talked him into just moving then instead of trying to get everyone together again. We loaded up dressers full of stuff, the washing machine still had wet laundry in it, the dryer was full of clothes, dirty dishes were tossed in a laundry basket. We moved his entire household in an evening.",

Most of his stuff went to his dads garage but there wasn\u2019t enough room so last minute I had to store things in my apartment. He complained the whole time about not having enough notice to move even though the move out date was scheduled from the time he signed his lease. I spent 12 hours helping him in the summer heat after getting off work. His roommates sat around most of the day smoking and watching us. And just as I was finishing up his roommate asked me if they could stay with me until they found another place to stay, someone who I didn\u2019t even know that well. Although my friend was very thankful, the day was chaotic. Although I love him, just don\u2019t be this guy.",

That was it. 3 kids and herself and almost nothing is packed. I took one look, said \"good luck, see you later.\" and left.

Your date night perfumes and makeups can probably be packed a week or two beforehand. You can start packing clothes and shoes and stuff. All but the essential kitchen stuff can start to go. You can take the time to pack and protect your TV properly.\n\nBy the time you\u2019re a day or two before your move, just go ahead and pack a bag like you were packing for a trip. Few changes of clothes, electronics and chargers, basic toiletries. From there, basically everything else in the house can get packed.\n\nHave some grab and go food ready for moving day and you can pack the last of the dishes and cutlery and cookware the night before. Day of the move you basically just need to shove your bedding in a garbage bag and throw it in the moving pile (pro tip: get clear bags for this so it\u2019s obviously different than garbage), grab a bite to eat, and get moving.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine starting to pack a couple days before and expecting to do anything but just inefficiently shove disorganized shit into boxes and moving a bunch of stuff I should have just gotten rid of.

Any by that I mean take down the clothes hanging in the closet and carefully lay them in the back seat of their car. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t do a damn thing. She just told us how we should pack her things. \n\nWe were a bit salty about the lack of effort in preparation to moving day. But what really stood out the most was they didn\u2019t even feed us. No food, no beer, no sodas, not even water. She didn\u2019t even offer us tap water because she didn\u2019t want to have to move dirty cups. \n\nWe asked if food was going to be provided when we were nearing lunch time. She was floored that we implied she pay for it. So the rest of the group and I ended up ordering our own pizzas for delivery. She was miffed that we all collectively stop moving so we could eat. However, that didn\u2019t stop her from taking three slices of pizza for herself \u2014 that she didn\u2019t pay for \u2014 without asking. \n\nWe already did not approve of his choice in a fianc\u00e9e before the move. But after this, we pretty much cut off all relations with them. We voiced our frustration with him about her. But he kept defending her. He was a good guy, but unfortunately, she had him so tightly wound around her finger that we couldn\u2019t hang out with him without her. And she was so much of an insufferable bitch, that we just gave up trying.",

            "comment": "I'll never forget the time we helped a buddy move from his small one-bedroom apartment to another of the same size.\n\nAbout five of us had been asked to help on a Saturday, and we were happy to help and figured it'd only take an hour or so, maximum two hours.\n\nWe get there and he's still adding things to boxes, and the bed (an IKEA style one) hasn't even been taken apart.\n\nHe then tells us that another friend of his from outside of group \"is coming with the van soon\".\n\nI suppose it was about 20 minutes later when the van arrived, and we could start taking things down the 5 flights of stairs as there was no elevator in his building. But that wasn't the worst part.\n\nWe were wondering why he himself wasn't picking anything up, and he comes out with \"I've got a sore back so I'm gonna leave the heavy stuff to you guys\".\n\nSo as we were lugging his sofa, table, chairs etc downstairs, he was slowly taking apart the bed. When we arrive to start moving the bed we see he hasn't even been bothered to remove all the cum-filled tissues and socks that were hidden under it - the filthy bastard.\n\nAnyway at the other end - the new apartment - we take everything up and thankfully there's an elevator. He has brought a crate of beer, but it's not been refrigerated, so nobody wants one. No offer of food, nothing.\n\nAnyway due to other things, less than a year had passed and he was completely out of our circle of friends and nobody has spoken to him since. One ungrateful little swine.\n\nNow if that's me I'm ready the day before and sleeping on a blow up mattress the last night and eating take away that can be thrown away. I'm either hiring a van for 24 hours and it's parked overnight ready, or I'm getting it early in the morning. Plus I'm probably offering to take those who help me out for a few rounds of drinks or at least getting cold beer and hot pizza in.",

It's one of my least favorite things to do. Movers aren't perfect or stress-free by any stretch of the imagination, but they reduce the stress of the move by at least 40% and that's worth many hundreds of dollars to me, after tip. \n\nAlso every professional mover I've ever hired is insanely fast. They can move a 2 bedroom apartment across town in under 4 hours no sweat. When we moved house-to-house it took about 8 hours but that's only because they weren't able to bring their big truck and had to make two trips (45 mins each way). \n\nAlso, you always need to assume something will get broken during the move. It might be something big or something small, but something will break. Don't blame the movers unless they were being intentionally careless. They do a difficult, physical job and don't get paid enough. Yet many of them are still consummate professionals.",

If you ordered boxed ikea style furniture that needs to be assembled, that is not on me. I\u2019m here to lift your belongings out of one home and into another, and it is now on you to unpack, arrange, and otherwise assemble things.\n\nThis is, of course, within reason. An unbreakable rule is whoever moves the bed frame also assembles the bed frame, unless otherwise instructed by the owner. I also will be happy to place any furniture or boxes in the right room, I\u2019m not just dropping everything in the front door and leaving.",

The person asking such favors are creating a situation(s) that can try or strain relationships, therefore the actions you have mentioned are bedrock for keeping and strengthening relationships and have a productive move.  Also, The person helping should always always be clear on what assistance they can provide and their limits (like, \"i cant lift heavy stuff\" or \"we can use my truck, but the truck and i are gone after 5, you gotta be cool with that\").  And the \"pizza rule\" - while it doesnt have to be pizza, it has to work with those helping -- none of this \"...and after we're done we'll go to...\" --- damn, we just helped you move all day, im hungry, and now we're goin out to somewhere , tired, possibly sweaty, dirty, frazzled, no thanks.  Pizza, to me, is really a great solution - easy, casual, delicious w/o weighing ya down, just there when people need a break.   Hey, if the move goes right, no one's miffed, lol --offer them a beer at the bar after, but dont make that part of the initial plan.",

No matter what just try to give someone a heads up as to what is involved.\n\nAlso, if simply hanging out all day because you get distracted is too much trouble, maybe they aren\u2019t a friend worth committing to helping in the first place.",

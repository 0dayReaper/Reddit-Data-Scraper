    "postText": "Why YSK: You should be aware of the medical care that is available to you, as well as the potential costs. Knowing that your hospital bill may be covered if your financial situation is not ideal could make the difference between life and death.\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act mandates hospitals must provide a \u201cfinancial assistance policy\u201d that \u201cmust apply to all emergency and other medically necessary care provided by the hospital facility\u201d in order for the hospital to maintain its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit. Seeing as 57% of all hospitals are non-profit, this policy applies to majority of hospitals. If you are uninsured, these policies most likely to apply to you. However, even insured people can qualify in many situations.\n\nSimply search \u201c *name of hospital* financial assistance \u201c and go to the hospital\u2019s financial assistance page. Somewhere on that page there should be a document called \u201cFinancial Assistance Policy\u201d, and inside of that it will tell you the qualifying income for total coverage, as well as qualifying income for partial coverage. Please read it thoroughly to understand what you may or may not qualify for. For the most part this only applies to emergent, non-elective, and catastrophic care.. otherwise known as \u201cmedically necessary care\u201d.\n\nAs an example, the hospital closest to me covers my entire hospital bill if I make under 200% of the FPL, which would mean I have to make less than $25,760 if I was a 1 person household, or $53,000 for my family of 4. In addition they will offer partial coverage if I make under 600% of the FPL.\n\nSource: [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/financial-assistance-policy-and-emergency-medical-care-policy-section-501r4)\n\nIf you look in my history, I have posted this before. I think enough time has passed that this information should be shared again. Please share to anyone you think it might help.",

For most people who get insurance through their employer the company pays part and the rest comes from their paycheck.\n\nThen comes copays. This is the part you have to pay with each visit (ACA \"obamacare\" was able to get rid of these for a couple specific appointments to encourage health maintenance). Most plans have a regular in network primary care copay, different specialist copay, and different emergency room copay. This all requires the provider to be \"in-network\" which means the provider has agreements with the insurance already.\n\nThen you have co-insurance which is the % you pay for certain types of care like surgery.\n\nDepending on your insurance it may pay for a part of out-of-network coverage or not.\n\nNow for extra fun:\nA hospital can be in-network while specific providers at the hospital are out of network. Example, I've basically never heard of an anaesthesiologist that accepted insurance, so they bill separately and you have to pay that without coverage.\n\nInsurance gets to say how much they pay the provider and what is necessary. This can get extra complicated because you can ask and plan all you want and someone uses the wrong code and suddenly it isn't covered.\n\nI had a simple surgery where I was lucky that they were able to code and Bill as I was in the waiting room. It did not go through until the 3rd code they tried and my insurance still could have rejected it later and sent me the bill. Still had to cover anaesthesia and some of the tests needed myself.\n\nBut why not just skip insurance? Because the total costs of an emergency are so very very high that you'd absolutely go bankrupt trying to pay without it. Financially it is still a very bad idea to go without even if it is not a guarantee that you'll survive financially with it.",

You should have better luck now.\n\nI recommend finding out what scoring model the creditors you\u2019re considering applying to use. Vantage scores don\u2019t include med debt and some scoring models for FICO don\u2019t either. And now, even the FICO ones who do, put much less emphasis on it than before.\n\nFrom my experience, if you can show some recent positive history, even if it\u2019s through secured credit cards, that\u2019ll outweigh medical debt for most (not a pro but I help a lot of people build/repair credit)",

I went from paying anywhere from $500-$600 at Costco for two pairs to paying between $1-$30 a pair online. Now I have a collection of approximately 13 pairs + a pair of sunglasses. Of course they all have you pay S/H which is usually around $10-$15, though a couple go as low as $5.99 for shipping and handling. I've found many more sites as well. A few even offer your first pair free w/paid shipping. And they frequently have sales, coupons and clearance options starting at $1.\n\nzeelool.com\nfirmoo.com\nublins.com\npayneglasses.com\nsllac.com\nglasseslit.com\n zenni.com\n\nI've ordered glasses from all of the aforementioned websites. I usually purchase a few pairs at a time. By doing it that way and  choosing $10 and under frames+anti-glare/scratch resistant I've purchased four pairs before for less than $46.\n\n*maybe I should post this as it's own YSK post?

For example, in late 2021 I went to an in-network ER for a couple of hours and the bill came to roughly $5000. Even though it was in-network, my insurance carrier was an absolute dick and denied it several months later (TL;DR). \n\nThat being said, once I saw $5K I called the financial assistance people at the hospital and explained the situation. I was very direct and stated the obvious: 5K out of pocket is hard for anyone, it\u2019s outrageous. They agreed after several calls and said they\u2019d pay 80% of the bill (that\u2019s their policy). The rest id pay in monthly increments. Not an ideal situation or solution by any means, but my point is even if you\u2019re at or above that FPL, you can still call and talk about possible options. \n\nBut\u2026. You do have to be the one to take initiative and follow up several times.",

I have Chinese neighbors and they rarely have visitors from home and now I wonder if it's because their relatives are so poor they'd be uncomfortable in an American home. Only ten million homes in rural China have basic hygiene toilets, out of 565 million. That means no fly larve, for instance. Many of the basic hygiene toilets still don't have handwashing so intestinal worms are a problem as are fecal oral diseases.

Very few people know to stand when someone older comes into the room, the food is never going to be right. You have to go to the farmers market to get fresh vegetables.  Ticket prices aren't that bad, especially if youve got air miles. Relatives usually come for a couple months, when we had my husband's family here from England it was never less than a month. \n\nIt's sad / funny to hear about someone's mother or grandmother standing on top of an American toilet and squatting. \n\nAnd Japanese bars or clubs are always behind unlabeled doors in business centers which is a real surprise but then you see how much sense it makes.",

It doesn't matter how easy a problem is to solve, if the number of problems to solve becomes too large, there simply isn't enough time in the day for each person to find and enact individualized solutions. \n\nThat's not even taking into account that many problems people face are intentionally made more difficult by outside (often times profit-seeking) forces. See: individual carbon footprint, recycling efforts, personal transportation options, tax preparation, etc.\n\nEven without the influence of special interests seeking to offload their externalities onto consumers, some problems are just really difficult to solve and are best solved by experts. Sometimes I need to call a plumber, or a doctor, or a mechanic, or an engineer, because I'd be dead before I had the time to attain the same level of expertise they individually hold in their respective fields of study or trades.",

In medicine esp emergency medicine it\u2019s all about getting info out there that\u2019s to the point and necessary\u2026 so like imagine going to a hospitals website scrambling to find the address or services you need to know if they offer or policies and you go online and instead their site is filled with info and pop ups about the assistance programs and stuff. It would take away from the import information first, but it\u2019s still accessible if you take the time and look. People in need can have such chips on their shoulder and feel all entitled to information without even asking or looking themselves and jump straight to complaining\u2026 which is illustrated by your very angry at the world post.

Until both political parties aren't bought and paid for by the  conglomerate oligarchy, the piss pour system will continue. If I made just enough money to pay my mortgage and bills, I'd be disqualified for any Healthcare help at my local Healthcare system. And I'm not living in a mansion and driving a porche.

I'm very glad there are some safety nets for the people barely scraping by, but until you and others like you realize how bad these systems are put together and managed and vote accordingly, the shitshow will continue.",

Many of the physicians working at a hospital are not employed by the hospital. I'm not exactly sure whether or not this means the hospital does not have to abide by the rules OP is talking about, but I can tell you that in practice, they don't. \n\nThis also extends to insurance companies who will claim a certain ER or hospital is \"in network\" but then you get left with a massive bill because the anesthetist who was on your case was with a group that is out of network. \n\nI'm about to be an attending physician and even as a resident, I'm constantly having to think about whether or not it's worth getting that extra test that may give me a little more information because I have to worry that the patient is going to end up paying for it. At my hospital at least, we constantly have conversations with our case managers about what we need to write in our notes to tread that line between not lying and making sure insurance pays the bill. It's fucking ridiculous that sometimes an honest mistake can leave the patient in a bad position and makes you second guess everything you write down.\n\nI had a patient who wasn't working with PT for about a week during his 45+ day stay in the hospital. I wrote that in my notes for that week. He's been denied by every skilled nursing facility we want to send him to because they're all concerned he's not going to be covered because of that one week where it was documented that he wasn't working with PT, even though he's been doing fine for 3+ weeks since then.

It\u2019s been a few years and I still get a call occasionally, which I happily ignore. I successfully disputed all derogatory marks on my credit report, and feel pretty confident in saying that nothing is ever going to happen to me over that $18k bill.\n\nFull disclaimer before anybody tries this, it was a non-profit hospital, I declined to provide them with my social security number, and the only info they had was a photocopy of my DL and my phone number from when I was admitted to the ER. When I disputed the marks on my credit report, I claimed that it wasn\u2019t valid debt and that I had never received treatment at this hospital. The debt was owned by like the second or third collection agency at that point, so there was no way they could actually prove that it was mine.\n\nStill feels good to think about getting away with, lol. It\u2019s a valid option if you have the balls to try it and are tired of dealing with jumping through their hoops and have nothing to really lose.",

I did all the research, pored over the paperwork and websites for days but in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t necessary. \n\nI applied for financial aid 4 times to help with my $130,000+ bills but was denied because I was barely above the poverty level. When you\u2019re declined they will typically reduce the total hospital bill by 50%-70%because now you\u2019re a \u201ccash payer\u201d.  If insurance won\u2019t pay and you can\u2019t get financial assistance, the hospital will reduce the amount owed and ask you to make monthly payments.  If you can afford those payments, that\u2019s ideal. That\u2019s great. In my case, I couldn\u2019t afford the $900 monthly payments so I rejected their offer and I send them $300 a month, and they\u2019re fine with that.

I have insurance but even the lowest deductible is over 2k, then the out of pocket. I need a colonoscopy, endoscopy, surgery if they find something repairable, iron &amp; blood infusions because my ferritin levels are almost non existent. I\u2019m already not making my non-essential bills payments (credit card, personal loans) &amp; they\u2019ve been sent to collections. I paid off my car last year &amp; thought I\u2019d have \u201cextra\u201d money but now inflation. Probably going to end up selling it because insurance is becoming unaffordable. \n\nHow many people just choose to die rather than drive themselves to bankruptcy? I bet more than you\u2019d think.",

I had a liver biopsy in 2019 and when they called for payment I asked if there was any way they could help, and they said they'd take off 70% (yes, SEVENTY PER-CENT) of the total cost for the entire thing if I paid it off then. Luckily my mom had offered to help as well and I didn't get stuck in a payment plan because I didn't have that money right then. Similar thing happened in 2021 when I got a kidney infection and went to the ER. HUGE discount on the remaining bill.\n\nAnd both of those events were while I was on my parents' insurance still. So, even if you have insurance, they can still probably help.",

There's some catch.  There has to be.  \n\nThere's just no way, in our current world, that there exists a program that provides such a clear and obvious benefit to the poor and that is actually implemented.\n\nI'm sure they'd promise such a thing.  Social stability requires that the wealthy and empowered few pretend that they have some measure of compassion, so there's some propaganda value in claiming to do something like this.

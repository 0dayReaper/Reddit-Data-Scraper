    "postText": "Why YSK\n\nYSK that deleting evidence that might be used against you in a pending civil or criminal case violates the spoilation rule. Unsending messages is now becoming an issue for attorneys with the latest iOS update. As an attorney though, I can tell you that by doing so, you are opening a whole new can of worms that will most likely cause you to lose. I've already seen this happen in a case I am working, and I imagine it will become a bigger issue. Basically, unsending messages results in evidence destruction, and doing so will allow the Court to issue heavy sanctions against your case and could lead to a negative inference as to the message. That is, the Court will assume that whatever you sent is bad for your case and use the fact you destroyed it as an argument against you. Do not ever destroy evidence, and if you unsend a message, you do so at your own peril. Of course, this isn't legal advice, but if your attorney ever tells you to do this, I'm almost 100% confident they are breaking at least their ethical duties.\n\nTL;DR: You're not smarter than the system, and deleting messages is going to cause you to lose a case, or at the very least, it will hurt your case.\n\nEdit: I used the term spoliation wrong multiple times thanks to autocorrect. It's spoliation, not spoilation. \n\nResubmitted for rule 2.",

It doesn\u2019t actually just apply to litigation. It also applies with charges of discrimination because at that point, when someone has filed a charge, you\u2019re on notice of the potential for litigation. The rule states that if there is evidence of spoliation many different sanctions can apply: adverse inference, meaning that you destroyed the evidence, therefore the trier of fact can assume it was harmful to you; to monetary sanctions; to the judge just saying you\u2019ve lost the case and now the only question is damages.",

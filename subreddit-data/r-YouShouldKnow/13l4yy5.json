    "postText": "Why YSK: Many people will use top soil or no additional soil at all when planting flowers, small trees, etc. With proper care, these plants will usually survive, but lining your planting hole with potting soil will really help them thrive. I usually line the open hole with a couple inches of potting soil at the bottom and a bit more than that around and on top of the mound to really be sure that the plant is getting sufficient nutrients.\n\nThe catches:\n\n1. Potting soil is typically a bit more expensive than topsoil.\n\n2. Potting soil is much lighter and looser than topsoil, which means that you have to be extra careful to pack down the soil until it holds its structure well. I have also heard that this lighter composition helps roots propagate, furthering the growth and health of your plant.",

            "comment": "If I understand correctly, potting soil is designed to be very well draining, not always something you want for in-ground plants (you want well draining, but not to an excessive amount or it dries out).  Soil made for raised bed gardens or 'garden soil' both are pre-fertilized as well, so you can use those.  Or depending on the quality of the soil you're planting into you could always just add your own amendments - fertilizer, peat moss or coconut coir, compost. \n\nI usually dig holes a bit deeper and wider and fill with a mix of like I describe above - if nothing else I figure it will make life easy for the plant early on, then by the time the roots reach harder/less fertile soil they're strong enough to thrive in there, too.",

            "comment": "Well, sort of. By planting your plants into a mass of soil that is different from the soil around it essentially creates a \"pot\" in the ground and your plants will tend to not want to leave that soil. Roots will grow to the edge of the soil where it is different and \"turn\" to follow the edge of the soil horizon instead of continuing to spread far and wide. Some plants will grow great in these kinds of conditions, of you have a relatively large \"pot\" for them. This also works better than a container in that the soil will moderate the temperature and help keep moisture.\n\nThe more conventional garden advice is to amend the soil with nutrients and organic matter evenly. Incorporating your amendments by \"double digging\" is a common way to do this that doesn't create as dramatic soil boundary. Mechanically tilling the soil can be very effective, but can create harsh boundaries. Using mulch over a period of years and disturbing the soil as little as possible is what many organic gardeners swear by, but this is time consuming and slower to produce results.\n\nSource: master gardener training.",

            "comment": "Potting soil can be sufficient when used like this, but it has to be well sourced with the proper ingredients. Anything with artificial nutrient salts will provide your plant with good growth at the beginning, but won't supply them perpetually without new top dressings every so often. The trick is using organic potting mix with some compost to get those beneficial microorganisms to break down the nutrients and feed your plants the way they were meant to be fed.\n\nThe general rule is 1/3 potting soil, 1/3 compost, 1/3 native soil or top soil. This will give them the essential nutrients they need in the beginning while the beneficial organisms continue to break down nutrients for your plants to meet their long term needs. If successful, a modest amount of organic top dressing will be needed once a season since the microorganisms will thrive and live on, ready to serve for each following season.\n\nThis is kind of a basic tip, but I figure it'll help green growers with success early on \ud83d\udc4d\n\n*P.S.* Mulch will help insulate the ground around your plants as well as provide safety and food for beneficial organisms - micro and macro. Bacteria and fungi play an important part in breaking down all the different essential nutrients for plants...so the better you care for them, the better environment your plants will have to thrive!",

            "comment": "Or you could fertilize... \n\nPotting soil is just a mix of peat moss, pearlite, and vermiculite, with some nutrients and a wetting agent. They use that stuff for various reasons, but mostly because it holds tons of water without being 'too wet' and drowing the plants roots.\n\nYou could mix some of yourself quite easily.\n\nWhat OP is saying is kinda like eating fortified cereal to get your vitamins instead of just taking a multivitamin. Expensive and overly complicated.\n\n If your soil is even half decent you could just throw in some fertilizer and get the same results. If you lack organic matter or clay, which will reduce your nutrient holding ability of the soil (called ion exchange capacity) you could throw in a little straight peat moss with your fertilizer for a quarter of the cost. Maybe a some pearlite if you're feeling spendy.\n\nThe only way OPs method still wins out is if your soil pH is fucked. But even then I bet you could get a pH tester and lye  for less than bags and bags of potting soil.\n\nSource: I have a masters in applied plant science and work in agricultural research.",

            "comment": "Personally,  I have never had an orgasim with a guy during sexual intercourse. I have told a few that it just doesn't happen. Nothing they are doing wrong. It just doesn't happen. Which in turn, I have heard many times \"well, you have never had sex with me!\"\n  Nope, and I probably won't! \ud83d\ude09 \nBut the ones that I have, they almost KILLED themselves, (literally), trying to get me to the big O. Good Lord!! So I Fake it so he doesn't die,  he finishes &amp; here comes the \"yeah, I told ya, ya I knew I could get you to cum! I can tell! You weren't faking that!)\n   LOL! \nHoney, I have been faking orgasims all my life, trust me, you don't know!!  It's not for me, it for that fragile male ego. If I'm honest about it, the men can hardly handle it. Even if there are other ways to stimulate each other.  I'm willing to please him 100%,  make him KING OF THE BEDROOM!!  His ego isn't hurt at all during sex, I go through the motions so good, he doesn't know &amp; he is most definitely pleased.\n\nPs..I can stimulate with toys &amp; such with a guy. Just not intercourse of Anykind..",

You can't think of any way to explain this data aside from \"men ain't shit\"?  Try harder, a lot of ignored factors in that thinking.\n\nAlso, who uses this guilt-pushing as a sexual motivator?  If I made a \"women say yes to sex less than men, so HETERO WOMEN COULD STAND TO STEP THEIR SHIT UP\" post wouldn't you think that's wack?  Wouldn't I need to consider other factors before dumbly assigning that kind of blame to half the people on earth?",

Ejaculation happens even if the man feels nothing  \n\n\nAll I'm saying is, ejaculation rates being higher does not mean pleasure is higher for them than others",

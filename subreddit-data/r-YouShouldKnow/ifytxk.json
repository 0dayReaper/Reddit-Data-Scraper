    "postText": "Anecdotally, the problem is getting *severe.* I used to buy all my household basics on Amazon (shampoo, toothpaste, etc), and I've gotten a very high rate of fake products over the past 2 years or so, specifically.\n\nMost recently, I bought a bottle of shampoo that seemed really odd and gave me a pretty serious rash on my scalp. I contacted the manufacturer, and they confirmed it was a fake. Amazon will offer to give your money back if you send it back, but that's all the protection you have as a buyer.\n\nSince I started noticing this issue, I've gotten counterfeit batteries, counterfeit shampoo, and counterfeit guitar strings, and they were *all sold by Amazon.com.* It got so bad that I completely stopped using Amazon. \n\nThe bigger question is \"what the hell is going on?\" This didn't seem to be a problem, say, 5 years ago. I started looking into why this was the case, and I found a pretty clear answer: **commingled inventory.**\n\nBasically, it works like this:\n\n- As we know, Amazon has third-party sellers that have their products fulfilled by Amazon.\n- These sellers send in their products to be stored at an Amazon warehouse\n- When a buyer buys that item, Amazon will ship the products directly to buyers.\n\nSounds straight-forward enough, right? Here's the problem, though: **Amazon treats all items with the same SKU as identical.**\n\nSo, let's say I am a third-party seller on Amazon, and I am selling Crest Toothpaste. I send 100 tubes of Crest Toothpaste to Amazon for Amazon fulfillment, and then 100 tubes are listed by me on Amazon. The problem is that my tubes of Crest aren't entered into the system as \"SolitaryEgg's Storefront Crest Toothpaste,\" they are just entered as \"Crest Toothpaste\" and thrown into a bin with *all the other crest toothpaste.* Even the main \"sold by Amazon.com\" stock.\n\nYou can see why this is not good. If you go and buy something from Amazon, you'll be sent a product that literally anyone could've sent in. It's basically become a big flea market with no accountability, and even Amazon themselves don't keep track of who sent in what. It doesn't matter if you buy it directly from Amazon, or a third party seller with 5 star reviews, or a third party seller with 1 star reviews.  Regardless, someone (or a robot) at the warehouse is going to go to the Crest Toothpaste bin, grab a random one, and send it to you. And it could've come *from anywhere.*\n\nThis is especially bad because it doesn't just *allow* for counterfeit items, it actively encourages it. If I'm a shady dude, I can send in a bunch of fake crest toothpaste. I get credit for those items and can sell them on Amazon. Then when someone buys it from me, my customer will *probably* get a legitimate tube that some other seller (or Amazon themselves) sent in. My fake tubes will just get lost in the mix, and if someone notices it's fake, some other poor seller will likely get the bad review/return. \n\nI started looking around Amazon's reviews, and almost *every product* has some % of people complaining about counterfeit products, or products where the safety seal was removed and re-added. It's not everyone of course, but it seems like some % of people get fake products pretty much across the board, from vitamins to lotions to toothpastes and everything else. Seriously, go check any household product right now and read the 1-star reviews, and I guarantee you you'll find photos of fake products, items with needle-punctures in the safety seals, etc etc. It's rampant. Now, sure, some of these people might be lying, but I doubt they all are.\n\nIn the end, this \"commingled inventory\" has created a pretty serious counterfeit problem on amazon, and it can actually be a *really really* serious problem if you're buying vitamins, household cleaners, personal hygiene products, etc. And there is literally nothing you can do about it, because commingled inventory also means that \"sold by amazon\" and seller reviews are completely meaningless.\n\nIt's surprising to me that this problem seems to get almost no attention. Here's a source that explains it pretty well:\n\nhttps://blog.redpoints.com/en/amazon-commingled-inventory-management\n\nbut you can find a lot of legitimate sources online to read more about it. A lot of big newspapers have covered the issue. A few more reads:\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/12/13/how-to-protect-your-family-from-dangerous-fakes-on-amazon-this-holiday-season/#716ea6d77cf1\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/amazon-may-have-a-counterfeit-problem/558482/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/14/how-amazons-quest-more-cheaper-products-has-resulted-flea-market-fakes/\n\nEDIT: And, no, I'm not an anti-Amazon shill. No, I don't work for Amazon's competitors (do they even have competitors anymore?). I'm just a person who got a bunch of fake stuff on Amazon, got a scalp rash from counterfeit shampoo, then went down an internet rabbit hole.",

They make comics, many of which turn into memes around here, (shout out \"Cyanide &amp; Happiness (Explosm.net)\" http://explosm.net).\n\nAnyway, they have a card game like cards against humanity that you finish the comic with your card. It's called Joking Hazard. My brother bought it online from amazon.ca. we got it and played a few times. Great game!\n\nI month later, we went to a comic expo and they were there doing autographs and the like. They are pretty great, and one of the things they were doing creating new cards. Every box comes with a few blank cards that you can draw your own, they would take it and draw something on the spot. \n\nWell we got there and give the box to the artist (Rob I think?). He asked where we got it, cause they were selling them there at the booth. When we said Amazon.ca, he took the box and one of his own. Cards were twice as think in the other box and the picture was just basically a sticker on cardboard instead of their beautiful laminate box. \n\nHe asked us to exchange it with one of their boxes as evidence. I guess they were having all kinds of issues getting it removed from the Canada Amazon store, saying they don't have enough evidence and stuff. We got a brand new box and a fancy card drawn up!\n\nSo yeah, buy direct wherever you can. You will have so many artists and creators thankful to you for it.\n\nEdit: got a picture of the card http://imgur.com/a/ElwcNPJ\n\nEdit 2: Explosm comment below! https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ifytxk/ysk_that_amazon_has_a_serious_problem_with/g2tfkpa",

Turns out, in some cases people are stealing the rejected pieces from the factories and repackaging them. You pay full price for an expensive board game through Amazon, and what you get looks good enough to fool you into thinking it\u2019s legit, but you\u2019re actually getting rejects and fakes and the money is all going to scammers, not the game designers you intended to support.",

You get official pieces direct from the company and they're almost across the board really good about helping with that!

            "comment": "You want to know what's even fucking crazier? Counterfeiters also use Amazon's anti-counterfeiting measures against them.\n\nBasically if you suspect that listings under a particular product are fake, you can submit a complaint with minimal evidence to be reviewed by an \"investigator\" who then has to make a judgement call as to whether the products are legit or not. Under normal circumstances this would be difficult, but not impossible, so long as the investigator actually took the time to review the case. Unfortunately Amazon runs this shit like a call-center so they've got about 5 minutes to review a case before making a decision and moving onto the next one.\n\nObviously this has led to literally *thousands* of false complaints against legitimate products from actual counterfeiters pretending to be lawyers, authorized sellers, and even representatives of big name brands. Because counterfeiters don't just submit one complaint, they'll send a hundred. Ninety-nine will be denied, but all it takes is one to be approved and all the legit listings are all pulled from the marketplace. Then this whole rigmarole starts where the legitimate sellers have to appeal the removal of their products, which can take hours to be resolved. Meanwhile the only available seller on the listing is selling their counterfeit inventory.\n\nSo after a few hours, Amazon realizes it's mistake, reinstates the listings which were removed, shuts down the counterfeit account, and that's the end right?\n\nWrong, the counterfeiter just spins up their next account (they have literally hundreds of thousands of aged accounts which they created back when Amazons account creation process was much less thorough) and repeat it all almost immediately.\n\nThe biggest products which were counterfeited were nutraceuticals, essential oils, and various beauty products such as make-up and shampoo.\n\nIt should also be noted that [counterfeit pills have led to several drug overdoses](https://themarkup.org/banned-bounty/2020/06/18/how-we-investigated-banned-items-on-amazon-com).\n\n\nEdit: Admittedly my info might be a year or two old, and u/silentlee2 has graciously pointed out that the aforementioned *investigators* are currently called *ISS Reps.* \n\nSadly, however, they are still required to meet daily quotas.",

Having a dedicated counterfeit claim department that was made up of enough actual people to have actual people review each case would alleviate a lot of these problems.  \n\nTo OP\u2019s point, there isn\u2019t really anything inherently wrong with commingling inventory, but Amazon\u2019s commingling system as it stands is problematic because of automated case review AND because of their one-listing-per-product policy. This is a strictly enforced policy to make sure that identical products have only one listing, and it\u2019s enforced to make the shopping experience less overcrowded and confusing.  It means that if you are selling product XYZ, and product XYZ is already being sold on Amazon (maybe by the manufacturer, maybe by a distributor, maybe just some guy doing retail arbitrage from his basement, maybe a counterfitter, it doesn\u2019t matter) you cannot create a new product page (listing) for it. You must use the existing listing, or your product must be demonstrably different enough to justify having its own listing.  That means that anyone selling a counterfeit product MUST use the listing for the original product, and there is very little the original seller can do, as you has detailed.  It also means that these \u201cidentical\u201d products coming from different sellers, must also have the same ASIN (it\u2019s like a SKU, but it\u2019s assigned by Amazon, locked to a specific listing, and cannot be changed by sellers), so when the \u201cidentical\u201d products of various origins arrive at the warehouses, they all have the same ASINs because they MUST. \n\nThe one-listing-per-product policy is actually one of the features that makes shopping on Amazon easier, but Amazon doesn\u2019t care about how it affects sellers, because they never care how any of their policies affect sellers, because to them sellers are infinite and replaceable.   It\u2019s this attitude towards sellers which led to their 90% automated seller support system which then leads to people getting rashes from counterfeit shampoo AND sellers getting screwed by shady competitors.\n\nEDIT to add the part about ASINs.",

Went back to that same listing and there were suddenly very mixed reviews over what people had gotten just in the time between my ordering and receiving. Pictures with labels that looked fuzzy compared to what the real ones looked like. People warning not to use it with pics of red rashy spots on thier faces.

First order of business was to use Amazon labels (with an fnsku starting with X000) to prevent comingling. Any brand with a brain does this. Not everything on Amazon is comingled.\nStill, people say our products are counterfeit because they have new packaging, or try to interpret our batch numbers as a date and send it back saying it's expired.  Next year i will put more focus on getting brand gated. \nYou can tell a brand is gated if instead of a blue link with the brand is near the title, there is an image with the brand trademark. That means only brand verified resellers are allowed to sell the product on Amazon. \n\nIf you get a product from Amazon and the packaging doesn't have a sticker covering the gtin/ean/upc code with a barcode starting with x000, then it was a comingled product. If you see the x000 barcode, then it was individually labeled by that seller to prevent comingling, and that cost money. \n\nYou bought from a seller and it was comingled inventory? Leave that as feedback. If everyone did then the feedback system would actually be useful for customers.",

How do they track that?\n\nI work for a food manufacturer and every single case of product we sell has a unique serial number on it. If we ever have a non-voluntary recall for some reason, we have two hours to track down where each and every case went. Anything left in our warehouses immediately gets put on hold, any of our customers who have bought the product are notified immediately so that they can pull it off the shelves and notify their customers who may have bought the product. \n\nAs a consumer I have even been notified by email of a product recall because they matched up a SKU to my loyalty card. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how a company with the worldwide reach of Amazon has no controls. I wonder how many people would die due to a bad ingredient in some counterfeit toothpaste before they even realized, let alone got it recalled.",

Our practices are also audited every two years. Also, x% of our product is tested at the lab for different bacteria, so IF something were to ever be picked up, we can hopefully know about it before product even ever hits the shelves. \n\nObviously none of this is happening with counterfeit product, so it would be nice if Amazon was more serious about weeding it out before it gets commingled. \n\nBut yes, you\u2019re right. I suppose they would just recall the whole SKU. I just wonder how many people would die before anyone figured out it was something in counterfeit toothpaste fulfilled by Amazon.",

The issue is that it's basically just a system that attempts to mark items as legitimate as they enter the warehouse, and it allows brands to remove individual listing from the site. But it doesn't solve the core problem. Even if they find some counterfeit products, the issue remains of commingled inventory on popular items and a complete lack of supplier accountability.\n\nSetting up a system that encourages counterfeits, then trying to find individual counterfeits, is the definition of a band-aid solution IMO. It sorta seems to me like they set up this \"anti-counterfeit\" program to appease the government and companies that were upset about all the counterfeits (and not to actually solve the problem).\n\nTo actually solve the problem, they would need to assign every individual item to individual sellers, which would likely massively increase their warehouse costs. And, sadly, they make a ton of money on Amazon fulfillment, so they have no motivation to place any sort of burden on small-time sellers with any sort of real accountability or verification process. \n\n/u/EVILB0NG also pointed out some other issues with their \"anti-counterfeit system\" in a comment below:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/youshouldknow/comments/ifytxk/_/g2qqm64",

Then someone on Reddit let me know it's because a lot of the cords are counterfeit and to go with Anker (yes hailcorporate) cords. No problem since.\n\n--but I went back to write a negative review for the shitty cords I'd bought beforehand and the seller contacted me within a month saying (paraphrasing) \"plz remove your negative review or change it to five stars. I'll pay you $15.\" -- the motherfucker contacted me at my personal email somehow! Not my amazon login email (which is me + amazon  at myemail.com), but my personal email! I contacted Amazon support about it and they were pretty much like \"kthx\"\n\nWhat a shitshow that place has become.",

So when you receive a counterfeit item and report it, they know which Seller it came from and they can quarantine that Seller\u2019s inventory while they investigate. \n\nSellers have the ability to opt out of commingled inventory. If you ever get an item with an X00... sticker on it, that was non-commingled inventory. \n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t currently commingle retail inventory with 3P Seller inventory. They do this to avoid accidentally selling counterfeit items under the Amazon name. \n\nAll that said, counterfeit is a huge problem that Amazon actually cares about dealing with because they know it\u2019s undermining the value of their platform. \n\nSource: I was an engineer at Amazon (specifically in FBA) from 2014 until about 6 months ago.",

They use the sales data of the third party sellers to see what is selling great, and use the reviews data to ensure customers like it. Then they'll call up the manufacturer and buy the item in bulk, cleaning out all stock of the item, but only offer to buy at \"shakedown\" prices. I spoke with many manufacturers, trying to buy inventory of a hot product, only to hear their stories of the rigorous agreements they signed with Amazon and how they regret taking the early payday of a bulk sale. This locks out the very sellers (like me) who took the chance on the product and bought inventory of it when it was a risky unreviewed product. Then no one can sell it but Amazon. Then the next stop is if it's a lasting top seller, Amazon will contact a manufacturer and make it themselves, undercutting all the manufacturers in that niche under the Amazon basics brand. Lastly for the coup de gras, they experiment with pricing in advanced ways, making constant changes. Sometimes you'll look at a product, it's not even cheap compared to other stores, but only during certain times and products so you don't get wise as a consumer. So to recap they manage to use data and their massive money/power to screw over manufacturers , sellers, and the customer too!",

Because some of the articles are very convinced that some \"sold by Amazon\" listings are commingled, and anecdotally, I'm pretty confident that I've personally gotten third-party/counterfeit items when purchasing directly from Amazon.\n\nEdit: /u/kwiddoes23 works for a third-party seller and added some insights that I think clears up all this confusion:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/youshouldknow/comments/ifytxk/_/g2rcjse\n\nBasically you *can* choose to not have your inventory commingled and receive a unique barcode, but the seller has to pay for this \"luxury.\"",

Amazon will ding you as the seller for \u201cselling a counterfeit product\u201d even though it was their mistake for even accepting and receiving counterfeit product in their warehouse. So we have to work twice as hard as an honest seller to prove to amazon we sell legitimate product, and yet somehow all the counterfeiters are just running multiple storefronts to mask their activities. \n\n2. There are two ways to help counteract this - one, you can pay Amazon a steep fee per unit to put a unique seller sticker on every unit you sell (if you ever order an item from amazon and there\u2019s a sticker with a code that begins with an \u201cX,\u201d then congrats you actually bought the inventory that seller submitted). Or two - you can also pay amazon another hefty fee to join their \u201cTransparency\u201d program, which is where you pay amazon per sticker for a unique barcode for your product (this is the QR code that comes on products you order from Amazon). This is an expensive program and these stickers have to be put on EVERYTHING that comes out of a brand\u2019s factory. It\u2019s crazy. \n\nI guess my point is Amazon is doing everything they can to push the responsibility of counterfeit sellers on to the shoulders of third party sellers in the way of added fees for ensuring the inventory is correct instead of taking the extra couple minutes to train their warehouse employees to actually look at a product before scanning it in.\n\nAs a parting note, even though commingled inventory is a thing, always do your research on a seller before buying! :)",

Now I check Google before I buy anything just to make sure I'm getting the best deal. I'm finding better deals on the actual store's websites than on Amazon nowadays.",

Sometimes it\u2019s something you can replace with another item, like a favorite toothpaste, sometimes it\u2019s something that is needed, and your only choice is a crapshoot at Amazon.  \n\nI\u2019m really grateful that you fell down that internet rabbit hole.  Your post is clear, concise and a bit scary.  \n\nNow what do we do about it?!?",

When they import \"Crest\" toothpaste from China to disperse across their warehouses in the US, their consignee will be a distribution house with no contact information, and their shipper will be a global trade corporation that's impossible to find - it's like 95% of Amazon companies are shell corporations. Without knowing true manufacturers and ingredients - instead having to assume it based on what's listed as the ingredients in actual Crest (though there's obviously no way it's the same) - we're left with bad merchandise being sold at similar prices to the real kind. Though the fake one is almost certainly just mostly plastic (all our recycled plastic had to go somewhere, right?). *And* it's nearly impossible to trace since there are so many of those companies that only exist on Amazon. Amazon's a more expensive version of Wish, but with more middlemen. As soon as I learned all their practices and how evil they are, I canceled my Prime and will never get it again. Thanks to literally everyone else now also offering online ordering, I haven't missed it at all.",

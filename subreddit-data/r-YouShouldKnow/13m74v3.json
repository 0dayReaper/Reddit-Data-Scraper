    "postText": "Why YSK: in a male dog's body, the prostate lies next to the rectum. Elderly dogs may get a swollen prostate and this makes it harder for them to pass stools. If your dog suddenly has trouble pooping or makes flat, ribbon-shaped stools, take him to the vet to make sure he has no other problems. \nWhen my twelve year old border collie started pooping three or four times a day I wasn't unduly worried at first; the\nstools were soft and looked healthy (no blood or slime, normal colour). He was otherwise lively and happy, eating well, shiny coat, etc. But after a while I noticed\nhe had trouble pushing and nothing came out, so then I took him to the vet straight away. \nUnfortunately, it turned out he had prostate cancer and it had already spread to other parts of his body. He lived for another three months with the help of drugs, but when it became clear he was in a lot of pain, I had him put to sleep. I can't help but think that if I had taken him to the vet a few months earlier, my poor Skip might have had a few more years in him.",

When I got him neutered, I ordered his hips and elbows x-rayed. He's a Rottweiler, and it's almost expected to deal with dysplasia. I expected to be saving for a TPLO or two.\n\nWell, the x-ray made them ultrasound his abdomen to really get a good look. His prostate was way too big. The solution was to neuter him, which was already done. His prostate went back to normal, and he's happy for all the cuddles, rubs and scritches I can give him. \u2764\ufe0f",

Folks were so oblivious - it's just a black wire on the ground, looks so innocuous.\n\nI've never had police respond so fast to a 911 call, and they immediately cordoned off the area.",

The car is on rubber tires and there aren\u2019t many places in a modern consumer vehicle that would put you in a path between the downed line and the tires to ground. Even if there were, it would take a very high voltage transmission line for that to be a concern. Don\u2019t wait until your vehicle catches fire and you have to start worrying about leaving the vehicle, where step and touch potential could easily kill you.\n\nEDIT: I took a harder position because staying in the path of a live power line is just not a good idea. Do not exit the vehicle unless it\u2019s burning; instead, use the electrical properties of the vehicle to safely drive at least 40 feet away from the downed line if you are able to. Also, do your absolute best to avoid conductive paths in the vehicle. Now wouldn\u2019t be a good time to use the cigarette lighter or make a call on your CB radio.",

Personally I wouldn't drive away- either the protection worked, the line is dead (we have recloser systems that may reenergize it at any point, always treat a downed line as live) and you're better off waiting for help without doing anything, or the line is energized and your car isn't safe to operate.",

Totally different system- the metallic body of the car acts as a Faraday cage which means that the inside of the car is insulated (in theory, try not to move too much and touch too many interior surfaces to test it). Your car could be solidly grounded and the inside would still be insulated. \n\nLike I said, I work in an adjacent field so I thought I would share my opinion until a real expert shows up, but I don't think driving away is a good idea.",

            "comment": "I work as an engineer for a utility company. We have set general rules we have to follow when it comes to downed lines, and I will explain what (almost) every wire's function is in as few words as possible.\n\nPRIMARY LINES: First off, primary lines are your main lines going between power poles, up at the top. You may see 1, 2, or 3 lines at the very top, which means: single phase, two phase, or three phase. These can be of varying size and are very rarely coated in rubber. They are usually shiny twisted strands of aluminum wire. Copper is becoming less and less prevalent as it becomes very fragile when exposed to weather. Depending on the load needed, the voltage (in our region) will range from 13,800 volts to 34,500 volts, for the distribution side anyways.\n\nWhen these PRIMARY LINES are down and still live, they generally won't kill you from a distance, but that doesn't mean they can't. We have a rule that when primary line are down, we CANNOT step out of our vehicles within 2 spans (a span is the distance of wire from pole to pole) until the linemen come and knock out the fuse that the live wire is on. However, 95% of the time when a Primary wire goes down, it sends a surge of amperage back upstream, blowing out the nearest line fuse/trip saver/recloser/breaker. When our systems work properly, the line poses no immediate danger, however; the line must always be treated as though it is live.\n\nNEUTRAL WIRE: Underneath the primary wire is always a thinner, though still metallic wire that is called the neutral. The neutral is not live, it has no power flowing through it. We still do not want anyone approaching it and recommend contacting your power utility/911 to get us out there to repair it. Again, downed lines must be treated at being live, even if they aren't.\n\nTELECOM WIRE: Underneath the neutral is usually, but not always, one or more rubber coated wires. They're usually near the halfway point of a power pole. If they fall, they pose no harm. Along with that, calling your power utility won't do anything for you as we are forbidden from touching Telecom wires. They aren't our property, they're whatever Telephone or cable companys' that put em up there. They will sue the crap out of us for touching their wire.\n\nSECONDARY WIRE. Often times, where there is a transformer on a pole, you will see a mix of aluminum and rubber wire twisted around each other. That is what we call secondary, or \"service\" wire. This is wire that powers houses/businesses/barns/etc. They run at a much lower voltage, 120/240V on single phase, or 277/480 on three phase. However, despite the lowered voltage, the rules of electricity still apply and the amperage shoots up, thereby also making this wire deadly. It won't cause fires when broken, nor will it look dangerous. But rest assured, if you touch it, it will seriously harm or kill you.\n\nOur general standard here is that we aren't allowed within 50 feet of downed secondary, and we cannot leave the scene until linemen arrive.",

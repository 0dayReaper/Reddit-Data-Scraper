Tolkien, Marvin Gaye, Disney come to mind.\n\nEdit: to everyone who thinks I don't know copyright lasts decades after death, my point is that *other people* are enforcing those copyrights, notably their family or some corporation. People who had no stake in the original work and some weren't even alive for its creation.",

As such, we are hereby issuing a cease and desist letter to request that you immediately stop using this trademarked phrase in your communications.\n\nWe understand that the phrase \"the phrase \"cease and desist\"\" has been used for many years in legal circles and is a common term used to request that someone stop a particular activity. However, we are now informed that Disney owns the rights to this phrase and any unauthorized use of it may result in legal action.\n\nTherefore, we kindly request that you refrain from using the phrase \"the phrase \"cease and desist\"\" in any form of communication, including but not limited to emails, letters, texts, and carrier pigeons. Instead, we suggest using alternative phrases such as \"the phrase \"stop it right now\"\" or \"the phrase \"knock it off.\"\"\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we must respect the trademark rights of Disney. Failure to comply with this request may result in legal action, which we assure you is no laughing matter.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDisney Legal Team",

Almost FAANG but not yet. \n\nSo my friend and I built this from scratch. Launched it. 1.5 million visits and the law suit arrives overnight from a company in New York. \n\nCompany makes 108 Mil revenue per year.  We make $0 because we are not monetizing. \n\nWant us to shut down and hand over our product and tech based on the copyright trademark and patent bullshit. \n\nI told them \u201cI could have built this shit using excel, your technology can\u2019t be copy righted. It\u2019s a basic review system\u201d\n\nThey moved forward with the lawsuit. 9K (Hired Malloy and Malloy) these people are the baddies of trademark and copyright in the USA. \n\nLater, they drop the case when it was scheduled for court.  \n\nI speak to my lawyer post dismissal or whatever. \n\nHe said it like this \n\n\u201cthese big companies do this all the time, they bully smaller companies hoping they\u2019re stupid and don\u2019t understand the law or don\u2019t have the knowledge to seek legal advice. They bully smaller companies into free products that they later call theirs and moneytize\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThese big companies have lawyers on retainer and if they don\u2019t use their hours they lose them. So they purposely look for products that they want on their portfolio and take it by meaningless legal jargon. Hoping that you\u2019re an idiot\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a multi-million dollar industry in company stealing other peoples products. It\u2019s not ilegal to sue someone even if it\u2019s false pretenses. There\u2019s no penalty besides court time\u201d\n\nThat day I learned a lot of these entrepreneurs are just wealthy kids that have the money to steal your product from you. \n\nRemember people are stupid as it is and some have built companies over the years with loyal customers and whatever. They get pressured into selling because they don\u2019t want the headache of following or are stupid enough to hand it over. \n\nJust like those scams on Instagram. \u201cGrow your leads by 10000% or close 60K more in sales this month by using our proprietary ads\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all bullshit to some people but others believe and go along with it. \n\nThis world was built on the rich stealing from\nThe stupid.",

Full comic omnibuses can be over 1GB each. An audiobook in good quality can range from 500MB to multiple GB. \n\nAll in all, if you want a text based library that has no images, you could get away with a few gigabytes of space dedicated to thousands and thousands of books.

And websites generally tend to not stand the tests of time. And a lot of times information about random niche topics tent to be under such links. All of this factors mean that running a gigantic online encyclopedia very dependent on online resources is quite difficult. Way Back Machine is what keeps Wikipedia running.

One digital copy per physical copy. During covid lockdown they deliberately and publicly scrapped that rule and loaned out more digital copies than they had physical copies of.

I suppose that during a national emergency they became a single viable source for a lot of that material which would borderline on that fair use doctrine.  \nI guess my next question is if they attempted to police the lending library?  Did they ask people to validate their intentions to ensure they fitted in with the spirit of the doctrine or did they allow unfettered lending to anyone with an internet connection?  In my mind even a self declaration would be a step in the right direction.",

I sat on a university copyright committee, and it was ridiculously messy. A copyright lawyer told me the answer is always, \"It depends.\" Contrary to popular belief, \"for educational purposes\" doesn't automatically skirt anything, and the publishers set those guidelines. One might allow up to one chapter of a textbook to be copied/uploaded \"for classroom use\" while another might limit it to a page. Want to show a film in class that's not part of a database? You'll probably need to form another subcommittee to find out if it's legal. (The university library ended up buying a whole service, so instructors could show *Schindler's List*.)\n\nAll that's to say, even with the doctrine it can still be very subjective. I think this lawsuit could've been provoked in the name of clarification.",

                    "comment": "The Open Library lawsuit has been all over the news since 2020 when it was filed, you just missed it. Note that a lot of news is misrepresenting what the fight is about and why it came about. \n\nIt's fairly complicated but the short story is that most book sellers didn't like the library system to begin with but then the internet archive did a really stupid thing and decided that the law doesn't apply to them during covid. This gave their opponents the nuclear bomb they needed to blow up the internet archive.\n\nLonger story is that the whole Internet archive library system is not a real library. They operated, pre covid, by buying books and then digitally logging them into a system, where they would then lend them at a one for one rate. So if they had 50 huckleberry Finn's they'd lend 50. This is technically not legal, but nobody really went after them for this, but again it's not actually permitted to do this - digital rentals are done by purchasing a license per rental approved and these licenses are only good for so many years. \n\nDuring covid, the Internet Archive decided that they'd operate by allowing unlimited rentals of the same book. So now they may have had 1 copy of Huckleberry Finn but lend 50,000. This is literally what piracy is in the digital world, and while I acknowledge reddit couldn't give a shit about piracy - the courts absolutely do.  Internet Archive decided that they could do this because COVID shut down libraries, and this gave them power to do it. This however isn't even close to what the law says, you can't just suddenly ignore the law like this. The result was that 4 major publishers (Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley &amp; Sons, and Penguin Random House) filed a suit claiming that the Internet Archive broke the law (which again is pretty much without a doubt). In response to this, the internet archive pulled back to its original plan of 1 physical copy for one digital, but IA had now crossed a line and given the system they are using probably isn't legal, they felt the desire to continue. \n\n**With all that said: most of the internet archive is safe. Only it's Open Library is at risk** so your wayback machine is likely going nowhere.",

            "comment": "&gt; Four corporate publishers have a big problem with this, so they\u2019ve sued the Internet Archive. In\u00a0Hachette v. Internet Archive, the Hachette Publishing Group, Penguin Random House, HarperCollins and Wiley have alleged that the IA is committing copyright infringement. Now a federal judge has ruled in the publishers\u2019 favor. The IA is appealing the decision.\n\n&gt; This is fundamentally a strike against taxpayer-funded public services by corporations and private individuals. While Hachette and other publishers ultimately formulated the assault on the IA, novelists were cheering them on. Novelist Chuck Wendig disingenuously\u00a0criticized\u00a0the IA\u2019s Emergency Library, saying that \u201cartists get no safety net,\u201d and pointed out unemployment and healthcare costs for writers.\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s examine why exactly the plaintiffs are upset about IA. In 2020, the IA\u00a0introduced\u00a0the National Emergency Library, which made copyrighted books available for free during the COVID-19 pandemic. The publishers behind the lawsuit alleged that this entailed copyright infringement. The judge, who was hostile from the beginning, decided to rule in the publishers\u2019 favor. In essence, a federal judge ruled against a program benefiting American taxpayers, in which multiple government-funded public libraries participate.\n\nFucking hell. Looks like the greedy corporates are winning.",

The main issue was whether the Internet Archive broke the law by simultaneously lending out more digital copies of a book than the number of physical copies it owned. They admit doing this for 12 weeks in their \u201cNational Emergency Library\u201d project. This is illegal, regardless of whether it should be. \n\nThe case is not over yet, and the amount of damages that the Internet Archive will have to pay is still undecided. However, this does not affect their normal practice of lending out one e-book at a time, which is also done by other online libraries.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_v._Internet_Archive",

This is a bit of a grey area when it comes to copyright law although it is a well astablished practice but I'll get to that.\n\nIn 2020, the Internet archive made the decision to remove the lending limit on all digital books, calling this the national emergency library, essentially removing the limit on how many people could have access to the same book at the same time. This pissed off the big publishers, and to be fair, it probably is reasonable to conclude this was outside of fair use, a number of large publishers brought a lawsuit against the Internet archive and the IA brought the emergency library programme to an end.\n\nThe publishers have used this indiscretion to justify an attack on CDL, a well established practice which is in my opinion very important for the future of library's and the free availability of literature and information in a digital age. Its also worth noting that separate from this, publishers and authors are already looking at ways to limit the first sale doctrine (the idea that once you buy a book, you are free to sell it or lend it to people without ongoing obligations to the authors or publishers) this in itself is a a very complicated topic and a case can be made that authors specifically should benefit from the resale of their works however I see no workable solution for this and it has troubling connotations for further corruption of the first sale doctrine.\n \nBack to the digital world and the first sale doctrine has already been killed, digital media such as songs and films, once bought cannot usually be sold on (redigi vs capital records set this precedent with very questionable reasoning) and we have all just come to expect this when we buy digital assets. \n\nThe publishers are looking to push things a step further by explicitly attacking the process of CDL in their cought case and this is going to take some serious pushing back. The Internet archive broke the law and are very much on the back foot, however publishers are over stepping here and the IA is suddenly on the front line protecting CDL. Publishers are arguing that in scanning the books, the IA is creating a new product which cannot be learnt out under the first sale doctrine and a case needs to be made that CDL falls under fair use. \n\nThe reality is the Internet Archive probably isn't going anywhere any time soon but publishers could seriously clip their wings if they aren't pushed back on this, unfortunately it seems to be yet another example of problems arising from good legislation lagging a long way behind technology. I hope we don't loose CDL as I believe it's important for the future of library's and I think the first sale doctrine has already been watered-down more than enough in regard to digital media. Sorry for the long response, in short no, the IA probably won't be going anywhere any time soon, however they may have to stop CDL which would be a huge reduction in what they can offer and in what is freely available for everyone to access",

They have already lost their first court case on this matter.\n\nThe issue is, they were only allowed to digitally lend out books that they physically had possession of, to an equal amount of people at a time. So if they had 10 \"Holes\" books, they could loan 10 \"Holes\" books out at a time, if person 11 wants to read it, then one of the first 10 need to 'return' it. In practice though, they had 1 \"Holes\" book, and let as many people 'borrow' the digital copy whenever they wanted.\n\nIt was basically The Internet Archive distributing pirated goods, as they did not have the rights to distribute more copies than they owned.\n\nLegally I don't think they will win this case, and they shouldn't. Morally I feel like the case should be settled with a slap on the wrist and agreeing to not do it again. Their heart was in the right place to try and make more books accessible during Covid, but you can't just ignore copyright and distribution laws.",

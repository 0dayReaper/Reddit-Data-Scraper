I suppose they don't advertise it much in part because it's a little embarrassing? I dunno.",

The AP does some reporting, but largely, as the name implies is a service to which newspapers and orgs both subscribe and syndicate their own content.\n\nThis allows a news org to pickup up a story of interest from another part of the country and run with it the next day without worrying about attribution or rights issues. They, in turn, send the AP their own stories that can end up being used by other papers. That's the ASSOCIATED part of Associated Press.\n\nThis isn't by any means a new phenomenon. I used to maintain ancient satellite modems at a small regional paper that would pull in text based stories that would come over the wire. There are other orgs that do this as well.\n\nPapers and online sites might indeed begin to use more syndicated content as they shrink their staffs, but the vast majority of them never had a DC Bureau or one in NYC or Paris or LA or Beijing or Moscow etc.",

Every single day the NYT sends out over the wire its 'budget' for the day/night (used to be the next day's press runs) describing what stories they planned to run on the front page. This comes out midday and once in, newsrooms around the nation begin building their own budgets for the next day - often heavily factoring in the stories the NYT has chosen to feature. This has been going on for decades, also long before the internet. Included in the budget are often the exact stories from wire services (like AP/AFP/Reuters/etc) that will be used and editors can pick those up to discuss them pre-publication for inclusion in their own budget meetings.\n\nIt may seem like something a crazy person would accused all the media of collaborating on, but in reality, it's just that the NYT has always had orders of magnitude more reporters and more bureaus than almost everyone else. If you ever wondered how your local paper managed to have the same front page story at the same time as the NYT, this is why.",

            "comment": "AP, Reuters, AFP, PA are some of the biggest news agencies and earn from media outlets who subscribe to their content. So a media outlet could go behind a paywall and still make these options paid to access or have some sort of hoop (something like asking you to provide email to access the website or removing ads blocker)\n\nYes there are some outlets that have subscription to other outlets too. So there are quite a few that republish NYT, WSJ stories and that way you won't need to subscribe to them separately.\n\nSide: If an outlet is re-hashing/curating stories from one outlet to their own, there's a strong chance they don't cover the whole piece and cherry pick what they want to highlight.",

The NYT and others greatly restrict the republishing if their content online, and the cost of paying for that just for print has led most papers to drop them. However, the consolidation of ownership means most papers are part of big chains and can use stories from their sister sites for free.",

I feel like it's a weekly basis now where I walk by parked cars on phone calls about various things, one of which including a call from a person's doctor.",

I'm not sure if the person is just not aware or that they don't care. It can be irritating, but other times the conversations are so bizarre that it gives me a chuckle. Free entertainment, I suppose.",

The volume was at a reasonable level for driving around at a normal speed.  We stopped at a shop, and I went inside.  When I came back out, someone else had called her, and I was able to clearly hear the caller from outside of the car, since she had not turned the volume down.\n\nI think it is simply that people turn the call volume up to be appropriate for motorway speeds, then do not turn the volume down when sitting in parking lots or driving slowly.",

The lack of noise insulation also makes people turn up their volume higher when driving. Also, a lot of the speakers are in the door, so are basically as close to the outside of the car as possible.",

I work quality at a car manufacturer and from what I can remember, most of the soundproofing is where I just mentioned. This was back when I handled a lot of different parts of the vehicles years ago so they might have added more. I don't think there's really anything in the roof unless you count the padding under the fabric. I could see how the roof could become somewhat of a makeshift speaker which could carry the sound outside. Maybe even the doors too. This is just a wild speculation though lol.",

Take out the carpeting and seats and you will only hear rocks and the noise of your tires.",

Either because the engine just doesn't sound good (most 4cyl turbo) or insulation and regulations kill engine sounds (cars in europe).

Some people can sit in anechoic chambers and feel calm while others will feel anxious and nauseous. It's the same reason why certain people feel nauseous when using VR.

When you are in a plane or a room, it can be a lot easier for the brain to deal with it.",

He said it wasn't that loud so I told him I could hear ever word of his call. Ever since then I always turn my volume way down if I'm talking on BT or just turn BT off for the call.",

What's right behind the speaker?  A huge flat sheet of metal which sound from the speaker can vibrate, turning the whole door panel into something called a \"passive radiator\" - essentially a speaker to the outside world.  \n\nSound deadening your doors properly helps a ton.  Typically car manufacturers will fit a small square of low quality deadening in the middle of the panel.  Adding a layer or two right behind the speaker and more to the overall panel adds a load of mass to dampen vibrations and massively reduce sound escaping outside.  It also sounds way better inside.  \n\n[Slapping some sound deadening in one of my old cars a few years ago](https://imgur.com/a/yC3Qz9X)",

Now he says he does it on purpose, so we all know his plans (like, we are supposed to sit and listen to his 45 min call???

On of my phones, one of the primary microphones is on the bottom of the phone, while the other was next to the speaker next to the users ear, and because both devices were long and flat, if you held it closer to your ear for better hearing, your microphone would be harder to talk into. \n\nThat and bleh cell service from certain legacy carriers.",

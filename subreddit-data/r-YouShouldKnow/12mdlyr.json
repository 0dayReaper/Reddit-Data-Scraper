You can turn this off so it won't happen [again] \n\nMy wifes phone kept calling 911 randomly when she was driving and had her phone on its side in the door. There's a siren sound then your phone calls 911. She would then get a call back from the police department.\n\nIt's on android and ios, a setting called Emergency SOS. If your phone has randomly called 911 this is why! The default setting on android is to press your power button 5 times. \n\nSometimes the police would come check on her in person. There's another setting that gives 911 your exact location when you call, so they know exactly where you are.",

The call started with silence, then a voice saying, \"I just killed two people.\" The dispatcher asked for clarification, and he no response, only noise in the background. After a short silence, they say again, \"I killed two people.\" The dispatcher sends several officers to the address, and they are about to breach when the garage opens and a teenager walks out. Apparently, he was playing Rainbow Six Seige, and his phone auto dialed 911, and he didn't hear it because he had his headset on. The police were very understanding, and the dispatcher even suspected it could be related to a video game but had to send everyone because you can never be sure.",

I cancelled the call within 1 second though, so I don't think it connected.  It required 5 rapid button presses on the power.  When done a little slower it just activates the camera after 2 presses and doesn't make the call.  I think it's a good feature to know about, especially if say someone is injured and you have to use one hand to keep pressure and still need to dial 911, but nobody is around to do it for you.  My power button on my phone case is slightly recessed and doesn't activate from just a gentle graze, so I think I'll be keeping this feature active.",

I tried to turn the volume down, but didn't realize for a second in my sleepy stupor that I was hitting the power button.  All of a sudden, the alarm started blaring, and I freaked out not knowing what was happening and was too groggy to turn it off in time.  I finally turned it off just as the call was connecting.  It actually still shows up in my call history.  I ended up not being able to fall back asleep for the rest of the night because I was so paranoid that the cops were going to come banging on my door.  But no one called me back and no one showed up.  I live in a very rural area, so maybe that's why?  It's concerning if I ever do need help.  If this ever happens again, though, I will wait to talk to the operator now that I know what it all means. \n\nMy question now is, though, if this is supposed to be a stealthy way for you to dial 911 from your pocket if you're in a dangerous situation, doesn't that crazy alarm kind of give you away?  The alarm is helpful in alerting you to the fact that you're about to dial 911, but if you're trying to do it secretly, that sound is probably going to get you into worse trouble.  \n\nTL;DR: I am going to be afraid to touch my phone at night for a while.",

On most android based phones it has either a slide or button to call. \nMy phone has call, siren, and emergency mode buttons.\n\nSo just checking out the menu is not going to do any harm as long as you do not proceed with the call, I do recommend getting familiar with the menu since it is a very useful feature. The accidental calls are probably the result of the phone being in the pocket and the touchscreen freaking out and proceeding with the emergency.",

Nope.

We never know if it\u2019s a legit emergency or if someone accidentally used this Emergency SOS feature on their phone/smart watch. In most places, calling back until contact is made is the policy for 911 hang up calls. This means that if you don\u2019t stay on the line to explain that it was an accident, you\u2019re using up vital resources.\n\nSide note:\nA phone that doesn\u2019t have an active carrier plan (no one is paying for its service) can still dial 911. So before you give your child an old phone to play with thinking they can\u2019t call anyone, remember this. Dispatchers are flooded by children calling 911 like this. Some of them are so young that they can\u2019t even speak. This is incredibly inconvenient for emergency dispatchers.",

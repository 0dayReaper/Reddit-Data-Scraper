[Double Up America](https://doubleupamerica.org/) shows you a list of farmers markets/grocery stores in your state that participate in the program, where they match your EBT dollars, allowing you to get access to more fresh produce at no extra cost to you. \n\nIt\u2019s available in ~25 states.",

However, I looked at a farmers market in the area and their site mentions the [Market Match](https://seela.org/market-match/) program as well as the [GusNIP](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/hunger-food-security-programs/gus-schumacher-nutrition-incentive-program) program for LA county. I was not able to find information on GusNIP being statewide, but if you look into markets near you, perhaps there\u2019s a similar program, or both these programs.",

If you, like me, feel you have no control over this and find this campaign ridiculous, know there is a solution:\n\nGo to u/RealTacoBell 's profile and block that account. Once blocked the ad should stop appearing.\n\nEDIT: Some users are reporting an issue with directly blocking the account. Users are also stating if they mark the ad as spam then they can block the account that way. If you come across an issue, try that?",

The amazing thing about all the measures that they take to stop people blocking the account and commenting on ads just tells you that they know for a fact that they're pissing boatloads of people off. At what point does an advertiser realise \"hang on, maybe this campaign is doing more harm than good\". When you become aware that what you are doing is infuriating people, how in the fuck does it make the slightest bit of sense logically to double down as a response? In a way I don't blame Reddit Inc because their duty in this case is to provide the advertiser with a service. But the people behind this taco bell campaign have to be thicker than pigshit to not see that this is having the opposite effect of what they want.",

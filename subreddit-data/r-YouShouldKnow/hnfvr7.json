He has a somewhat abrasive personality at times when he\u2019s annoyed. An extreme couponer came through our store. She was known to be an unpleasant person, so they called my buddy to check her out. \n\nNow the Target POS system back then would crash at a certain point when you had a lot of coupons in the system on one purchase. \n\nMy buddy slowly went through the mountain of stuff she had accrued and was scanning in the coupons as he went. He got about 3/4 of the way through the items and coupons before the system crashed. He had to start all over. He wasn\u2019t upset, just acted annoyingly over happy to assist her. He knew damn well it\u2019d happen again if he tried to re-do it, but since she was kinda a bitch, did it all over to waste more of her time. The same exact thing happened and the lady stormed out. He said the whole process lasted about an hour and a half give or take. His shift was over by the time he had finished.",

The jurisprudence on gay people is evolving to consider them protected under gender/sex, because by saying a man can't love another man, you're discriminating based on only women being allowed to love a man.\n\nIt's at this point that I should point out that even for protected classes, there is legal discrimination.

Basically it\u2019s saying that you cannot discriminate against race because there is essentially 0 difference.

Age is okay most often because a child shouldn\u2019t be able to vote when they don\u2019t even understand the issues, plus a young person isn\u2019t young forever and when they are old enough to vote, they realize that they were immature when they were young.",

Remember young healthy 20 year old nurses are dying, because of exposure. If you want to have the assurance of a N95 (95% filtration) instead of a cotton assurance (70% filtration) wear a home made/ Etsy bought polypropylene/cotton facemask with coffee filter/ air-conditioning inserts (99% filtration) and to minimize the initial dose. Even if you wear a cotton single layer (70% effective) you'll only get mild symptoms, instead of deadly...by limiting the initial dose and  anything is better than nothing due to the fact that even if you're young and healthy a large exposure will kill you.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the initial viral dose, but cumulative viral load absolutely affects your likelihood of disease symptoms. That\u2019s why health care workers are much more at risk than someone just walking by an infected person one time.\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/04/14/how-much-of-the-coronavirus-does-it-take-to-make-you-sick/\n\nI recommend buying/making triple layer nonwoven polypropylene with inner cotton fabric masks, they sell some on Etsy.

More than 115 years ago, the US Supreme Court ruled that individual rights and liberties did\u00a0not\u00a0supersede a state\u2019s responsibility to protect it\u2019s citizens and eradicate a disease during emergency situations.\n\n\u201cThe government may impinge upon these rights, provided two things\". \u201cOne is that the government action is in pursuit of a compelling state interest or a very important government purpose. And the Supreme Court and other courts have ruled in the past that preventing the spreading of a pandemic is one of those. Secondly, has the government pursued that compelling interest or purpose in a way that\u2019s narrowly tailored? Does it impose unnecessary restrictions on freedoms? And so long as the government has done that, it will uphold these actions.\u201d So far, there aren\u2019t many examples of these restrictions across the country in which any kind of speech, religious practice, or other specific right is targeted. \n\n\n\nAlso, per Supreme Court case below, masks can be MANDATED\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/hnfvr7/ysk_it_is_perfectly_legal_to_make_you_wear_a_mask/",

If it's locations near beaches and such, sometimes they have an added rule of no swimsuits or swimsuit cover ups. You need real clothes on. \n\nHigh end restaurants sometimes require a very specific attire. Evening dress, slacks, suit jacket/blazers, and collared shirts typically. \n\nPutting mask on that list is no different and honestly easier than the fancy restaurant attire. Lol! Don't agree with that places attire? Don't go there. It's that simple. You wouldn't walk in with no pants on. Lol",

You typically buy a few clothes of some type when going on vacation anyway to plan for special events or climate difference. Like going to the beach, need a swimsuit or two and cover ups if you plan to go from the beach to shops. \n\nI agree though, sitting down and eating in formal ware is super awkward. \n\nMost dresses end up requiring a longline bra and it's almost like sitting in a corset if it's a full length one. Not easy or relaxing. Much more comfortable to stand up in. Plus if you have to drive or ride in a car that sucks while wearing one. Last event I wore one to I had my husband actually help me slip the thing out of my dress before I would sit in the car. Lol! I wasn't about to ride home for an hour in it after a long evening/night wearing it.\n\nI couldn't do it for literally just going from my house to a restaurant for a couple of hours and then back home. Too much effort to get all dressed up, hair and makeup done so I actually look totally out together. Lol",

If any Joe or Karen can walk into your place of business, you are a public business.  This would be like a restaurant, mall, grocery store, dentist's office, etc.  If you publicly solicit customers, you are a public business.\n\nThe Post Office and Public Library are government agencies, not businesses at all.",

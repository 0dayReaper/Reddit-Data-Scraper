While it might be a scary thought, a lot of people need to realize that people just aren't thinking about them. And that's fine! Research has shown the human brain has been wired to be selfish and care more about itself. So live life to the fullest and stop worrying about what others think about you!

Most of the time we're the only ones who think the bad things about ourselves, but our brains write a false narrative that says everyone else does as well.

Ask anyone who was bullied or has narcissistic parents. When they confront those that terrorized them on a regular basis it's often \"tHaT NeVeR hAPpEnED!\" or \"iT wAs JUsT A jOke!\"\n\nThis is some gaslighty advice in the OP. Basically \"It's all in your head maaaan!\" So okay, literally, hardly anyone is really thinking hard about you, but that doesn't mean they hesitate to take a moment to ruin your day on a whim because you wore the wrong brand of sneakers. The *thinking* isn't the problem, it's the thoughtless teasing.",

People are thinking about and interacting with other people in relation to their own personal biases every day, all day long.\n\nThis is one of those 'common knowledge' bs sayings that people mindlessly repeat that just simply isn't true. IMO, it's best to deal with the facts as they are.",

Empathy is good.\n\nHowever, I agree that if you're worried about what some randos in the grocery store are thinking about your hair, your clothes or if you are tan or have wrinkles, nobody is thinking about you that hard. Don't worry so much about what everyone else in the world is thinking about you or your stuff, they aren't. They are in their own head thinking about themselves and their own stuff. They probably don't even notice that you're there. Other than being something they have to maneuver around. \n\nMost people are just minding their own business. It's the people that break out of that and start minding other people's business that stick out. I would say like half of Karen videos are women that should be minding their own business, that aren't. Shut up and mind your own, Karen.",

Unlike with other sites, where one can at least argue targeted ads pay for free services, with this Verizon program, you are essentially receiving nothing in return for giving up your privacy.\n\n[This article provides instructions on how to opt out using the Verizon app](https://www.wired.com/story/verizon-user-privacy-settings/)\n\n[Try this link on the website](https://myvpostpay.verizon.com/ui/acct/secure/manageprivacysettings)\n\n[You can also try this link on their website to opt out.](https://myvpostpay.verizon.com/ui/acct/secure/profile/privacypreferences/customexperienceplus)\n\nEDIT:  Added another website link to try.\n\nEDIT 2: Appears to not apply to prepaid customers.\n\nIf you are concerned about privacy in general, here is an amazing resource of tools related to privacy: [https://piracy.vercel.app/privacy](https://piracy.vercel.app/privacy)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The only thing they are likely to receive is your DNS queries, assuming your device doesn\u2019t use secure DNS yet, which most don\u2019t. Once your device has resolved the domain to an IP address, that\u2019s the end of what Verizon or any other service provider can see.\n\nThis is precisely why Apple requires all HTTP communication from all apps to use HTTPS, unless there is an exemption listed for the app. Most sites use HTTPS these days.\n\nSo what exactly is Verizon doing here? I guess monitoring DNS queries is kind of nefarious, but\u2026 meh.",

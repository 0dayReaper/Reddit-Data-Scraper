    "postText": "Why YSK because you could have an unfortunate accident mowing over or near their nest. \n\nA rabbit nest could be in your lawn and you don\u2019t even know it. I had one of those unfortunate accidents when I mowed close to a nest which was right next to my patio\u2019s retaining wall. I decapitated two bunnies and the third one was spared. Unfortunately, I had bad bunny luck because the next day as I was playing ball with my 10 year old, that same bunny (I think) got spooked, ran headfirst into the picket fence, and died!\n\nSo before you mow, look for a bunny nest which often looks like a small patch of dead grass and may have some leaves or other plant matter on top of it to conceal the hole. If you see a small hole then go ahead and cover it with an upside down laundry basket and put a weight on top. This will protect them until you\u2019re done mowing.",

We kept a close eye on it, made sure we gave it a wide berth while mowing (a neighbor gave us a little fence to put around it, made it noticeable but left plenty of room for the bunnies to come and go) and after a couple weeks my wife peeked in and saw some tiny baby bunnies. I think they've already left the burrow now (it was empty last time we checked and I think I saw one of the babies scurrying away when I was mowing near the bushes).",

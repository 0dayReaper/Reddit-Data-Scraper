    "postText": "Why YSK: if someone is annoying you or does something that you disagree with, remember that you can\u2019t see inside their thoughts.   \n\nWhen you cut someone off in traffic, it\u2019s because you were being absentminded or because you\u2019re late to sing lullabies to your newborn, right? But when someone cuts YOU off, it\u2019s because they\u2019re a jerk. You don\u2019t know their inner thoughts, just the result of their actions in the world.   \n\nSo: take it easy on your fellow people this holiday season, and remember the fundamental attribution error. You\u2019ll be less stressed, less annoyed, and maybe even happier!",

How about when you focus only on the negative elements of a situation and you're dismissive of all the positive elements? That could be using what's called a mental filter, or it could be the one called maximizing and minimizing. Depending on which lists you find, there are 10 to 20 or so commonly recognized cognitive distortions and pretty much everyone experiences some of them at some time or another.",

                                    "comment": "Thank you for expanding on cognitive distortions. I looked up some ways to combat what you've listed and here's what I got: \n\n&gt;1) ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING: You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.\n\n\u2022 In order to overcome all-or-nothing thinking, it is important to avoid thinking in negative, absolute terms.\n\nDo's\n\n\u2022 Recognize strengths\n\n\u2022 Understand that setbacks happen\n\n\u2022 Find the positive in situations\n\nDon'ts\n\n\u2022 Focus on faults\n\n\u2022 Dwell on self-defeating thoughts\n\n\u2022 Use unconditional terms such as \"never\" or \"nothing\"\n\n&gt;2) OVERGENERALIZATION: You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.\n\n\u2022 Think through the accuracy of the statement. When you catch yourself using words like \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever,\u201d stop yourself and ask those words are accurate. \n\n\u2022 Replace that overly broad language with something more realistic. \n\n\u2022 Do not minimize the pattern either. Sometimes, there are legitimate patterns of mistreatment, and it is unhealthy to minimize those\n\n\u2022 Keep practicing. These shifts in thinking take time, and it is unrealistic to think you can change your interpretation style overnight.\n\n\n&gt;3) MENTAL FILTER: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that colors the entire beaker of water.\n\n\u2022 Building awareness\u00a0and recognition: if you\u2019re more aware of the mental filter and can notice when it\u2019s shaping your thoughts, you can try to shift your perspectives. Mindfulness practice\u00a0is one effective way to improve this awareness.\n\n\u2022 Purposely shift your attention to acknowledge more positives: one way out of the trap of the mental filter is to shift your thinking toward the neutral or positive aspects of a situation.\n\n\n&gt;4) DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \u201cdon\u2019t count\u201d for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.\n\n\u2022 Identify the problem.\u00a0For instance, you may recognize that you can\u2019t accept a compliment. That\u2019s the problem.\n\n\u2022 Recognize how you do it.\u00a0Going with the above example, you may discount the compliment by saying, \u201cThanks, but\u2026\u201d and making an excuse.\n\n\u2022 Ask yourself, \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d\u00a0Maybe you don\u2019t feel deserving of the compliment or you are embarrassed at the attention you are getting. Perhaps you have a fear of future expectations if you accept the compliment. This awareness is important. If you don\u2019t know why you sabotage yourself, it\u2019s hard to change your response.\n\n\u2022 Identify your triggers.\u00a0(Someone compliments or congratulates me.)\n\n\u2022 Identify where you would like to be\u00a0regarding the problem. (I would like to be able to accept compliments with grace.)\n\n\u2022 Visualize the solution.\u00a0Imagine yourself accepting a compliment with grace. (I will smile and simply say, \u201cThank you.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Create your strategy.\u00a0(The next time I feel the urge to discount someone\u2019s compliment, I will say, \u201cSTOP!\u201d in my head and instead say, \u201cThank you.\u201d) This step is important. Don\u2019t allow yourself room to argue with yourself. See yourself as a person who accepts compliments with grace and a simple \u201cthank you\u201d will be sufficient. Resist allowing yourself to elaborate. Just say, \u201cThank you.\u201d That\u2019s all! You can add more later, but keep it simple right now. The simpler it is, the more likely you are to remember it on the spot and be able to implement your intention.\n\n\n&gt;5) JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion. a. Mind reading. You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don\u2019t bother to check this out. b. The Fortune Teller Error. You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.\n\n\u2022 Think about times when you jumped to the wrong conclusions. ... \n\n\u2022 Test your ability to see the whole picture. ... \n\n\u2022 See how easily you are fooled by illusions. ... \n\n\u2022 Ask yourself if you are too quick to form an impression of a person.\n\n\n&gt;6) MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR MINIMIZATION: You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else\u2019s achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow\u2019s imperfections). This is also called the \u201cbinocular trick.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Consider utilizing a\u00a0panic diary\u00a0to track how these thoughts contribute to symptoms of panic disorder. Start by making a column and writing down the good and the bad of any situation. It can be difficult to notice at first, but even many bad situations can have a silver lining. Also, try to keep in mind that no one is perfect.6\ufeff Don\u2019t let your small mistakes or flaws overshadow all of your talents and achievements, and the beauty and specialness of simply being you.\n\n\n&gt;7) EMOTIONAL REASONING: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \u201cI feel it, therefore it must be true.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Utilizing relaxation techniques or self-affirmation, such as \u201cI am safe.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Give yourself permission to feel anxious. Then remind yourself that it is just a feeling and that does not have to define your reality.\n\n\n&gt;8) SHOULD STATEMENTS: You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn\u2019ts, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. \u201cMusts\u201d and \u201coughts\u201d are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.\n\n\u2022 Become aware of your\u00a0should, oughts, and\u00a0musts\u00a0and try to replace them with more encouraging thoughts.\n\n\u2022 Example (being afraid of flying in an airplane):\nInstead of saying,\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0should\u00a0be able to do this without any fear\u201d\u00a0and \u201cI am an adult for goodness sake. I\u00a0ought\u00a0to be comfortable on a plane!\u201d try to replace it with a more encouraging thought like, \n\"I do wish I wasn\u2019t so afraid of flying, but I am trying my best and working toward overcoming my fears. This will take time and in the meantime, I accept myself where I am in this process today.\u201d\n\n\n&gt;9) LABELING AND MISLABELING: This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: \u201cI\u2019m a loser.\u201d When someone else\u2019s behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: \u201cHe\u2019s a goddam louse.\u201d Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t equate yourself with a single event or situation.\n\n\u2022 Be aware of our own fears and insecurities.\n\n\u2022 Consider why we use specific labels that limit others.\n\n\u2022 Describe behavior with greater clarity instead of labeling people. \n\n\u2022 If we don't like the behavior we see, state what change we want to see.\n\n\n&gt;10) PERSONALIZATION: You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t catastrophize criticism.\u00a0If you get a rejection, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re never going to be successful. If you get negative feedback on a piece of work, it doesn\u2019t mean you have no capacity to become better at it or that you\u2019re not talented.If you find yourself personalizing rejection or negative feedback, ask yourself whether you\u2019re catastrophizing \u2014 blowing it up into far bigger of a deal than it is.\n\n\u2022 Be gentler to yourself\u00a0about your imperfections, mistakes, and times when you\u2019re not as good at something as you\u2019d like to be. If you can learn to be nicer to yourself about your imperfections, you won\u2019t automatically jump to feeling attacked when other people make comments.\n\n\u2022 Frame taking rejection well as a positive goal.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Learn to label your emotions accurately.\n\nOften, appropriate self-care for emotions just involves accepting that you\u2019re having the emotion and patiently waiting for it to pass. The things people do to try to \u201cget rid of\u201d their emotions usually end up causing more harm than good.\n\n\u2022 Put yourself in situations in which rejection is likely but doesn\u2019t have any major negative consequences.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t be overly eager to please because you\u2019re afraid of being disliked.\u00a0People who personalize often have attachment anxiety. If you act overly eager to please, you\u2019ll just end up believing that it\u2019s the only way to be accepted. Be warm but have good boundaries.",

But they have the stronger willpower so if I'm not over it by the time they're over it it only starts a whole new round of shit. So I gotta put it off, my own feelings, until I can sort through them by myself later. \n\nI really like your rule of thumb you gave as a reply to the other person. That you won't accept anything that you wouldn't do on your worst day. And the rules for engagement you laid out. To disengage when they become overtly hostile. \n\nCan I ask what you'd do to counteract if the conflict pursued you after you'd attempted to disengage? If not, thanks for the words. That really made me feel seen and even if you don't reply I wanna know you made me feel valid and I haven't felt so for a while. Thanks.",

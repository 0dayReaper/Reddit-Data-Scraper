For example, silent hunter 3, set on a submarine, has a navigation table view. On the table is a speed-time-distance nomogram that you can use to work out problems of that nature. \n\nUnfortunately the nomogram didn't cover the full range of times that I wanted, and I liked the idea of having alternate units. So I tried and failed to reproduce the table using autocad and inkscape. This proved impossible and led down a very long road to find that you need to apply some fairly serious algebra and linear algebra to get the thing done right. Plus the notation in the references is pretty confusing. I did come back around to it a year or so later and finally figure it out. \n\nBut in any case, right there you've got the speed/time/distance equations, so that's basic operations, simple algebra, unit conversion, then the nomogram itself will give you basic geometry and trig, similar triangles and so on. Then the development of the nomogram will give you some advanced algebra, linear algebra like operations with matrices, determinants, geometric interpretation of matrices, transformation matrices, eigenstuff, projections etc. Only missing calculus there, but I bet we could find it in the torpedo calcs. \n\nOn the other hand, I doubt kids today are playing silent hunter 3. I mean, I'm not even playing it anymore.",

They were trying to find the answer to a bunch of real world and unsolved theoretical problems. Rigor didn't come until later. Same thing with Fourier. Trying to teach without that context is crazy to me. \n\nThere's always a motivation section in textbooks but they miss the most important questions: What was the original purpose of this technique? Why did the inventor/discoverer think this would be a fruitful area of research? Did they try anything else that didn't work? Etc. \n\nI find that if I understand the real motivation and the overall objective of the technique, then it's much easier to figure out why we are doing each step. Most math teachers get lost in the arithmetic, to the detriment of their students.",

He's back to in person school this year and thriving but this site was absolutely amazing for his schooling for a single, disabled, poor mother of two who didn't have a lot of financial options for homeschooling. It was incredibly easy to use and had so many different educational options, it was a godsend.",

            "comment": "While Khan Academy is a great source for educating yourself for free, it kinda fucked up the American school system. As soon as it came out, they stopped teaching us math and just told us to go on Khan Academy during class instead. I'm the only person from my class who actually knows math, and that's because I was in accelerated classes in the years leading up to the \"mass customized learning\" change. I went through most HS math before I got out of the 6th grade, and then never learned a single bit of math again because they just gave up teaching us.\n\nEdit: To clarify, they didn't make sure that we actually completed any of the lessons, nor did they go over any of it as a class. They literally just replaced our math classes with Khan Academy, a site you can use for free, and just pocketed our property taxes, which are supposed to fund our children's educations.\n\nEdit 2: Most of the students weren't even on Khan Academy... they were just playing games on the computers we were lent to work on... and the teachers didn't give a shit because they weren't being paid enough to. I'm convinced the reason they switched to Khan Academy is that they realized they didn't have to pay for supplies, and could give the math teachers a pay cut, so the school administrators could just pocket all the money they took out of taxes to teach us.",

So, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.\n\nOr, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written\nout as 25% of 12 instead, which would be 3.\n\nExplanation: Commutative Property. So,\n0.07 times 50 will always equal 50 times\n0.07\n\nI hope you found this interesting and/or\nhelpful!",

Some people have an easier time with one method whole others struggle and understand an alternate method better. That's why we should teach the mutliple methods of doing math, not just one.\n\nThat the whole point of Common Core. It's about teaching the students various ways to solve problems.",

I know when my daughter was learning math the last couple years I talked to her teacher that I wanted to know how best to help my kids because obviously everything is different now and I don't want to steer them the wrong way when offering help. The teacher basically said not to worry and that any method that works for them is fine, and then pointed to a board on the wall that showed a bunch of different ways to do math, basically.\n\nI do find myself having to Google specific terminology sometimes, though, because we never used them but thankfully it's not too difficult.",

Here's what it actually looks like:  \n  \n    ( x * 1/100) * y = x * (1/100 * y)  \n  \nOddly enough, you do use the commutative property of multiplication when you say you are using the commutative property. But your example \"7% times 50 equals 50 times 7%\" is not what you're doing in the other problems.",

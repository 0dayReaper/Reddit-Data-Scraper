    "postText": "Why YSK: The posts are buried, but I think this is something a wider audience should know that there are options for 3rd party apps on either Android or iOS.\n\n\"We are working with RedReader and Dystopia (Beta) to make sure they have access and will continue to work with others. We\u2019ll review requests to ensure that the app is non-commercial and focused on accessibility needs. Approved apps can use the Data API for free.\"\n\nRedReader is on Google, Dystopia is in Beta for Apple. They are open-source and add-free as well.\n\nWe'll see what other apps they are working to approve (ex. Infinity) but there seems to a path at least for mobile users to not use the official app or use old with Beta/Nightly/Fennec.\n\nApollo, Boost, RiF, etc. would need go non-commercial to continue.  It would be up to the authors or they could open source their code.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RedReader/\n\nE: Add links and clarified app store and commercial apps.",

You never know when you may end up sending something out. \n\nAnd even when its from that year, a greeting card ain't the same thing as some random photo one decides to print out and send because it was discussed on a call and one says: \"oh hey I have a picture of that thing from a few months ago, let me print it out and send it to you Dad, since you use a flip phone and not a smart phone.\" (Just to be clear, my dad lives in another city in another state and it's a lot for him to travel.)\n\nMy younger sister was able to recover some old photos that we thought were lost to Katrina and I don't know when exactly they're from. Details for those photos are spread out amongst myself, my older sister, and our parents.\n\nMy mom has this one abstract drawing from my older sister when she was in highschool, and I *think* she incorporated her initials and the year in one of the corners when she drew it over 25 years ago.\n\nIt's not a common practice, but I believe what OP says makes a ton of sense. Details are eventually lost to the passage of time. \n\nSo to answer your question: my family is giving me \"X year old drawings,\" or pictures.",

You should gently slide them until they detach from the surface, or poke them until they contract into the shell then lift them up.",

    "postText": "The mantle is a muscle that holds the body to the shell and is responsible for keeping the shape of the snail inside the shell. It secretes calcium carbonate and is essential for healthy maintainence of the shell. The mantle encloses a delicate sac containing vital organs, including the lung and gills. Normally the mantle is expanded to meet the outer lip of the shell and you can see it encroaching and sometimes covering the columella. \n\nIf you keep pet snails or are rescuing them from a pavement for example, you should either slide them and get lift them off a smooth surface, or poke the shell gently until they retreat then lift them that way. Pulling them directly up when the foot is attached to the surface can cause mantle collapse. The mantle can either tear away from where it is connected to the shell or collapse entirely. Tears can heal quite quickly, because the snails can seem largely unaffected. They can still move around and eat, so it isn't long before they heal.\n\nHowever, if the mantle collapses the snail probably won\u2019t survive. A collapsed mantle looks like a sock covering the body. You can see over the rim and right down into the shell. The snail (when extended) looks strange and struggles to pull its shell around. It also struggles to retract as it has no real cavity to invaginate into. The collapse puts quite a bit of pressure on the lung as the breathing cavity is restricted. The snail often suffocates, or starves. Mantle collapse can sometimes be healable, depending to the degree of collapse, but it takes much longer because it is difficult to get the snail to eat/breathe properly. \n\nIf you keep pet snails and notice one showing signs of mantle collapse, you should use clove oil as an anaesthetic, then freeze it so it is safely and humanely euthanised. If you don\u2019t, the snail will probably suffer a terribly painful death as it can starve or suffocate, and cannot retreat into its shell for comfort and protection.\n\n[Edit: man, I\u2019m speechless but pleasantly surprised this post blew up! I come back a couple hours later and I have hundreds of comments to sift through and upvote! I hope it saves a few snails :) I just wanted to say thank you to all my snail saving comrades, and please don\u2019t feel guilty if you accidentally damaged them whilst trying to save them. It is the intention that counts, and hopefully you can use this method to save more in the future \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc0c and thank you to the lovely people who liked this post so much they gave me my first golds, plantinum, and other awards! I really do appreciate it :) \n\nThere\u2019s no way I can respond to everyone, though I\u2019d really like to, so I also wanted to address a couple points!\n1) who picks up snails? Well, I pick snails up, and so do others! If I see one in danger of being crushed, I pick it up using this method and move it gently to the nearest patch of vegetation. \n2) do snails feel pain? Well, I don\u2019t know for certain that snails feel pain, I can only imagine they do. This isn\u2019t a pleasant way to die. Doctors didn\u2019t think babies felt pain until they discovered they did, so just in case I try to treat fellow living creatures with respect. \n3) yes, people keep snails as pets! Check out r/snails for some inspiration and tips if you\u2019re looking to get involved with keeping them :) they\u2019re great pets. \n4) a lot of you are very violent and cruel. It makes me sad to know so many people out there take delight in causing a defenceless animal such hurt. As one user so helpfully pointed out, it\u2019s \u2018not a dog\u2019, so why should we treat it kindly? Well, it\u2019s still a living creature, and we should treat them with respect.\n5) yes, I said invaginate. It means to be turned inside out or folded back on itself to form a cavity or pouch.]",

Your post brightened up my day, by a lot.\n\nI think all creatures great and small are intrinsically  precious and worthy of respect, regardless of their perceived utility, or level of intelligence.\n\nI believe that our attitude to non-human rights is inseparable from our understanding of our own value and our place in the universe. \n\nSo, to me, an anthropocentric view of humans as \"exceptional\"/inherently special, and other animals as devoid of minds, \"souls\", or natural rights, one that dismisses their existence as \"lesser\", is tantamount to denying *our* nature, our own intrinsic worth as animals in the tree of life, and cutting off a vital part of ourselves in the process. \n\nJust like a bigot denies their own humanity by denying others theirs. \n\nOr, to put it another way, I'm basically borrowing civil rights rhetoric: the struggle, King Jr. and others affirmed, wasn't just about black American rights, but about human rights and the freedom and dignity of our species as a whole. \n\nHopefully, at some point in the future,  it'll be common and accepted for people to show compassion even to those beings we widely deem vastly inferior or  insignificant, like spiders, pigeons, snails...",

It decided to investigate and spent the next 24 hours crawling across the street, almost getting run over by a car a dozen times. It finally made it on a crisp spring morning and sat on the doormat to marvel at the bright blue door, when all of a sudden the door opened. A man wearing a bathrobe and with a cup of coffee in hand opened the door and looked down at the snail. He got a furious look in his eyes and grabbed the snail, tossing him back across the rod where the snail began his journey. The snail\u2019s she\u2019ll was broken, but not it\u2019s spirit. It slowly recovered and looked back at the blue door, even more determined now to return. It\u2019s journey across the street was even more treacherous this time, being so slow from the accident, and it was only by a miracle that it avoided getting smushed under a car tire. After three days, the snail once again made it to the door where he sat and waited. Sure enough, the next morning the main came out again in the same bathrobe and same mug of coffee in hand. He looked down at the snail, the snail looked up at him and said \u201cwhat the hell was that all about?\u201d\n-fin",

Ants can apparently pass the mirror test though, so they seem to have some capacity for self concept. Also, there is at least one species of fish, the cleaner wrasse, that has intelligence comparable to mammals.",

Insects absolutely have basic nociception, but from what I'm remembering from my classes, insects don't have a whole lot of processing beyond reflexes and central pattern generators. They're pretty much incapable of the subjective neural experiences that are generally defined as pain, in addition to avoidance of nociceptive stimuli.",

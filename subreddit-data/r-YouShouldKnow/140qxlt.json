    "postText": "My mum told me *no water til soapy* whenever I washed tupperware as a kid, and I didn't realize everyone didn't innately know this until fairly recently.  When you've stored any staining sauce in plastic (e.g. tomato. beet, curries) do not put *any water* in it until you have first slathered it in dishsoap and rubbed it into a brightly coloured foam.  Make sure the first rinse is with **cold** water.  Tada!  That's it!  \n\nYou can then finish washing it however you like \u2014 put it in the dishwasher to sanitize, whatever you like.  It's heat in the presence of colourful grease that creates permanent stains.  Conversely, when filling, let it cool first.  The same is true for anything that might be at all porous or has started to lose its glaze \u2014 old porcelain sinks, tiles, enamelware &amp;etc.\n\nGo forth and amaze.  May you never have manky disgusting cupboards full of unclean-looking things again!\n\n**Why YSK:** So you don't have to have stained and discoloured possessions.  Learning better methods to maintain and not damage things allows us to have nice things \u2014 and not need to replace them.  Start small, once you habitually care for your stuff, you'll realize responsibilities are much easier when you set yourself up to suceed by searching out the right tools and learning effective methods.  We all don't know what we don't know: stay inquisitive, and if necessary, make someone ETMLI5. \u2661",

Then it's fine to wash in hot soapy water as you normally do to degrease and sanitize. \n\nAlso, I'm only recommending letting food cool down, not advising that it sit out for hours!  According to food scientists at the USDA, bacteria growth starts after about two hours at room temperature (or as little as one hour when the ambient temp happens to be 90\u00b0 or more). \n\nWhile you're 100% correct that the absolute best practice is cooling **after** vacuum sealing at pasteurisation temperatures, letting cooked food cool for half to three-quarters of an hour is perfectly safe.  If you'd rather cool it faster, spread it out on a sheet pan or rack; if it's got high water content, put it in something large and shallow like a bain-marie \u2013 perhaps even putting said receptacles over ice or in cold water, as restaurants do.  \n\nSpeeding up the cooling time as much as possible (effectively blanching) is a particularly beneficial tactic if you are making food to freeze or refrigerate *before* serving it.  If you're producing in quantity for long-term storage, you should absolutely vacuum seal it, regardless of container choice, whether you achieve that via heat, wax, rubber, silicone, suction, or some combination.  \n\nOptimally food should be cooled to the low 40s before being refrigerated or frozen, because it's better for the unit and necessary for any food already inside not to have hot things put in it.\n\nTo give you a sense, safe temperatures for cooked meat range around 145 and 160\u00b0F, a safe temperature for cooking food in a microwave is 165\u00b0F, and a safe refrigerator temperature is below 40\u00b0 (ideally 37\u00b0).\n\nAside from any possible effects on refrigeration units, food, or the aesthetics or longevity of food containers \u2013 by not letting food cool properly prior to storage, there's increased risk to you if you use plastics, whether they're part of containers, wraps, or lids.\n\nLeakage of BPAs and/or other forever chemicals from plastics happens or doesn't happen for only certain specific reasons, and heat is definitely a factor.   As a rule of thumb, food that's too hot to stick your finger into comfortably can cause some plastics to release unsafe compounds.\n\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET), commonly used in water bottles, dome-like covers on foods and drinks, cookie or biscuit trays, cooking oil bottles, etc., doesn't have high temperature resistance, so it while fine for an iced drink, it's a bad option for _actually holding_ hot foods: think \"mustn't get hotter than a warm day.\"  \n\nPolylactic acid or high-density polyethylene are slightly better with maximum temperature resistance around 140\u00b0F and 180\u00b0F, respectively, but polypropylene is the best way to go since it can at least theoretically withstand temperatures of up to 250\u00b0F.  \n\nHDPE &amp; PP are the most common materials used in supposedly \"microwave-safe\" plastics, but nonetheless, if you are able to use non-porous containers **and** lids made of glass or ceramic when microwaving, that's **by far** the best standard practice to adopt.",

If non-greasy items such as the above are put into porous containers when *cool*, then the minimal staining which occurs should be removable with a good jet of cold water, possibly requiring little, if any, soap. \n\nIf the stuff that was put into it was, say, warm (probably delicious) high-fat Bolognese sauce, which might have been made not only with super stainers like red wine, ripe tomatoes, and hot pepper \u2013 but also with olive oil, walnuts, three or four kinds of meat, possibly some cheese thrown in there for good measure \u2013 then soap is absolutely NOT optional because cold water won't remove grease, grease holds color.\n\nI'm not a chemist, but fats which congeal at room temperature are nicely broken down by dish soap, and without it, they'd absolutely require higher temperatures to re-liquefy them \u2013 so if you've got grease and dyes together, soap to remove the grease, cold to remove the dye, then Bob's avuncular kinfolk.\n\nIf only a science nerd could jump in here... I just know it works.  We're talking general principles here, relevant to food storage-ware, laundry, crime scene cleanup, whatever.  ;-)",

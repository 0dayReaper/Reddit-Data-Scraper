You can speed this process by putting the unripened avocados in a plastic or paper bag with bananas, apples or other fruit. \n\nGuacamole is important. Prepare TODAY.",

We call it the dark arts of line cooking. Kind of like when you need sauteed mushrooms on the fly, you can just throw them in a deep fryer and they're done in a second. Ever have to cook a hamburger that's supposed to get bacon, but forget to throw the bacon down? Deep fry it. There's other more craftier ones that don't revolve around deep frying. But yeah. Sometimes you're just short on time and, as long as you're not the one eating it who gives a f*** anyways right? Lol.",

It was when we were getting severely hammered, getting paid $15 an hour, getting yelled at all the time, cooking sucks. I never even started earning vacation time until I was 27.

However, I was referring to San Jose, CA, which used to be an indigenous American tribal area until the Spanish priests enslaved them to build millions and execute them if they did not convert. Then they called it Mexico, up to Sonoma. \n\nUntil the Americans took it over in mid 1930s under President Martin Van Buren fulfilling the goal of previous President Andrew Jackson to have a coast to coast country. \n\nWhat's peculiar is that most of the people who celebrate  Cinco de Mayo, including Mexicans, have no idea why they are celebrating it. It has morphed into an event like St Patrick's day, another reason to consume copies amounts of beer, booze, guacamole and have a good time. Does one really need a reason? No, but it's a great excuse.",

The date actually commemorates the Battle of Puebla, when locals battled a French invasion and against all odds ended up winning. In Mexico it is not a holiday and pretty much only Puebla celebrates. Mexicans celebrate their true Cinco de Mayo on September 16th, which is the Independence Day.",

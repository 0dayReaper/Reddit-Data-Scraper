We have a lot of fine dining restaurants, but under the \"eat\" section, it listed mediocre restaurants I would never recommend to anyone, including a grocery store chain (nothing special about it), sub par pizza (definitely looks like it was written by a business owner) and other random medium places that are not unique to my city.",

Massive portions and massively tasty, my personal favorite spot in the entire city    \nSaburo's - Sushi with cuts as big as my female friend's fist    \nMatt's BBQ - Legit BBQ, top tier but not really \"Portland-y\", up to you    \nLuc Lac - Americanized Viet food but fun environment and still delicious,  open late, awesome spot for post-drinks night out    \nHa VL/Rose VL - Authentic Viet, diff dish each day, delicious     \n\n\nBeaches - Kelley Point Park is my favorite, private and quiet. Frenchman's Bar is big wide open with way more people if that's your vibe",

As someone who cooks nearly every meal and who has lived in various places around the country, most areas lack a high-quality local grocery chain that's anything like NS. You'd be lucky to get a one-off shop or co-op, and even then, those are tiny and usually hyper-focused on just produce or whatever.\n\nTheir stores are on the small side compared to most grocery stores, but they have a significantly better selection of produce (and so many mushrooms) and higher quality meat options. And they have everything else you could need, so it's a one-stop shop... I often drive past a Safeway to go to mine.\n\nI think Sizzle Pie is good, but I would probably recommend Baby Doll, and the buy section is completely lacking (I suppose this is a wiki, so there's nothing stopping me from adding to it...).",

Bel\u00e9m is fairly small (the archeology museum is worth a visit, there are a number of monuments that we inherited from the dictatorship), Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es is quite big but the part with the Ocean\u00e1rio is in the center of it... Bairro Alto is a neighbourhood, somewhat big, but it is smaller than other adjacent neighbourhoods.\n\nMy family has been living here for generations so I can't get a visitor's perspective, but I would say you would be fine just walking around and not bothering to much with a feeling that you have to do X, Y, Z tourist attractions. Walk around, eat where the locals are eating (Baixa is mostly tourist traps), go see the river, you'll be fine",

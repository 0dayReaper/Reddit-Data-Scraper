It's survived moving across the country twice, and now has several clone offspring.\n\nEventually we just started selling the stuff; we eat it regularly, my whole life in my case, but we were using maybe 5%, if that.",

Time on a page makes your site more attractive to advertisers, so Google is going to put you up if you spend more time, because ads placed on your site get more time to be displayed.\n\nIf it is just a recipe, you basically get what you want and leave. By making you scroll and search through garbage, you increase the time on the page.\n\nThe problem is that this heavily punishes quality websites. And this web is an example of that: BBC Food, which should be rather easy to find on Google, is not widely known.\n\nSo cooking bloggers are sort of forced to do this crap if they want to get visits.",

I've decided to edit all my previous comments as an act of protest against the recent changes in Reddit's API pricing model.    These changes are severe enough to threaten the existence of popular 3rd party apps like Apollo and Boost, which have been vital to the Reddit experience for countless users like you and me. The new API pricing is prohibitively expensive for these apps, potentially driving them out of business and thereby significantly reducing our options for how we interact with Reddit.  This isn't just about keeping our favorite apps alive, it's about maintaining the ethos of the internet: a place where freedom, diversity, and accessibility are championed. By pricing these third-party developers out of the market, Reddit is creating a less diverse, less accessible platform that caters more to their bottom line than to the best interests of the community.  If you're reading this, I urge you to make your voice heard. Stand with us in solidarity against these changes. The userbase is Reddit's most important asset, and together we have the power to influence this decision. r/Save3rdPartyApps -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/",

British husband only ever had fan-assisted while living in the UK. The gas mark is for older ovens, from what I understand. But I could be wrong there.\n\nThe fan-assisted ovens cook at a lower temperature because the air circulation makes it more efficient.\n\nSo if I'm doing conversions from British recipes here in the US, I only look at the temperatures for non-fan-assisted.",

Saves me baking time when I'm doing multiple bakes in the same session, but pretty risky bc you can't fire and forget without a high chance of burnt cookies.",

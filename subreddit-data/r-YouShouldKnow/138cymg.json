    "postText": "Why YSK: Not a lot of people understand what the Uber driver\u2019s pickup experience is, and I\u2019m sure it has caused lots of frustration and confusion.\n\nWhen your Uber driver arrives at the location set by you (ALWAYS double check that the pin is where you want it to be and where you expect it to be), a 2 minute timer starts. After this timer runs out, another 3 minute timer starts, during which your account will be charged for making the driver wait longer. After those 3 minutes, the app gives the driver the option to cancel your ride and charge you a cancellation fee.\n\nUber\u2019s navigational systems are also not fantastic, so you really shouldn\u2019t call for an Uber until you\u2019re ready to walk out the door. Don\u2019t count on the app telling you that your driver is 10 minutes away, giving you enough time to finish getting ready, because if you\u2019re not out within 5 minutes of the driver\u2019s arrival, chances are they will cancel your ride and charge you a fee.",

If they don\u2019t accept it it goes against them, so most drivers would probably accept your ride while there\u2019s still 5 or 6 minutes until their current ride is done. Factor in traffic and other outside forces and your driver might drive around at \u201crandom\u201d for 15 minutes before heading your direction. It\u2019s really a terrible system.",

I don\u2019t deliver myself but I know the people that do usually get multiple trips, so they try to hit all the stores before they start delivering. That more an Uber problem itself. \n\nFor driving I always care about my customers satisfaction. That\u2019s before and during the trip. I often hear that I\u2019m the best Uber driver people have had which is sad because the bar must be fucking low lol. I really don\u2019t do much besides get them to their destination as fast as safely possible and to make them laugh. \n\nAlso if you get in an Uber wear your damn seatbelt. Most people I drive are 20+ and don\u2019t care about their life apparently.",

If they are doing DD and UberEats at the same time they could be making six or more other stops between when they pick up my food and when they bring it to me. \n\nThey don\u2019t seem to understand- or care- that the one thing people really want out of food delivery is speed and freshness. \n\nAnd since yt have to tip ahead of time or no one will take your run, they don\u2019t give a shit what your experience as a customer is. So I tip $10 on a 2 mile delivery only for them to take an hour to get it to me after they pick it up. \n\nFuck that. I\u2019d rather starve.",

Just because you food was picked up from the restaurant does not mean you were the next delivery. You may have to wait quite a while. If your food is cold heat it up in the microwave. If you insist on a faster delivery don't cheap out and pay a little extra for the direct delivery.\n\nIt is also worth considering that many restaurants still have delivery and will do it for a small fee- often less than Uber or GrubHub.",

The person accepted the ride but just drove in circles for at least 30 minutes. Wouldn\u2019t answer when I texted them asking if they were still going to make it or if they could cancel so I could get another Uber. They took at least another 15 mins , didn\u2019t respond at all and canceled it. My other Uber came in 5 mins. There was no traffic around so I still have no idea what that joker was doing",

I started driving roughly 8 years ago, and stopped 2ish years ago. This was a problem when I started, and when I looked it up on the forums back then, it was clear that this was a problem almost from the start of Uber. So what\u2019s the problem?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you what *isn\u2019t* the problem\u2026Uber. Strangely enough, they\u2019re good here. The problem is with whoever they outsourced their GPS/GIS/mapping data to. The mapping company is the one responsible for essentially putting the \u201cpin\u201d to your address. Where that pin lands is where the navigation sends the driver. When the pin is placed towards the back of the property, nav looks at all the available routes to get as close to it as possible. Sometimes it\u2019s taking drivers to the front door, and sometimes it takes them through the alley. \n\nNow I know you said you put it at the front, but\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter. You essentially put it at the same address, so the system defaulted to the original location. Best advice, try putting it in the middle of the parking lot or at one corner of the building. A lot of people I picked up figured out that the address next door to their location worked the best.",

Even to the extent that drivers are involved in the problems Uber Health has (often not at all, i.e. with availability and capacity problems, particularly in rural areas), it falls on Uber to prevent/address that kind of thing.\n\nPartitioning off Uber Health rides for reliable, qualified drivers who want to take them would probably go a long way to addressing the problem.

If the pickup location didn't make sense, or I couldn't physically reach it I would call the rider. If you didn't answer I would wait a minute and call you again. If you still didn't answer or message me back I'd wait out the timer and get my cancelation fee. Now if I could see you on the map and could reach you I would just drive to your location or use common sense to figure out where you wanted to be picked up. Beyond that it's not my problem if you won't answer the phone or respond to my messages, especially after I've driven 10-15 minutes to get to you. Common sense isn't very common anymore. I've collected the cancellation fee from the same rider multiple times because they keep requesting the trip to the exact same location, I wait the 5 minutes, but during that time they won't answer the phone, won't respond to my messages, and are nowhere to be found.",

When we are getting ready and the estimated wait time is 5 minutes,  we may not be ready in 5 minutes so we wait until we would. Hit the ride request and then the 5th driver that accepts is 45 minutes away. I have a good rating and always tip well, but it\u2019s insanely frustrating when there can be a 40 minute swing from when the app says you\u2019ll get picked up vs what actually happens.\n\n\nEdit: just to add idk if there needs to be a soft acceptance but Uber used to be awesome for requesting a ride and getting picked up soon. If it was busy there was a surcharge\u2026 which I would happily pay to get an accurate time to be dropped off would be great. It seems like the moment that you take into account the long wait time you get rerouted to a 2 minute away driver. I\u2019m pretty sure they are tapping into my Alexa to hear me stressing out and  add more stress to getting where I\u2019m going then I already am.\n\nI don\u2019t like to do it this way but I\u2019m to the point of going to go ahead and request it based on the estimate, and then message them from their if they would need to wait that I\u2019ll pay. Uber is going to make people going back to cabs to schedule out their rides. Doesn\u2019t help when drivers will openly admit that they don\u2019t take rides less than 5 miles. It\u2019s frustrating but they need to get incentivized from Uber on these shorter rides because it financially doesn\u2019t make sense for them to take short rides, but that\u2019s what so many people use Uber for. Sorry to rant but after showing up over an hour late to a few events over the last year because of the times the app gives it starts to get to you",

I've been an Uber driver for 6 years and if a passenger isn't ready to go within 15 seconds of me arriving, I rate the passenger 1 star. The worse your passenger rating gets, the harder it will be for you to get a ride in the future (I don't accept rides from passengers that have a rating of less than 4.85).

Deleting an account leaves your posts and comments up, so using these tools allows you to properly delete everything.\n\nUnless you have reason to believe that someone might try to do harm to you if they can identify you from your reddit profile, there\u2019s no reason to worry about it or do anything. No different to having any other social media. Some people like their anonymity, so they do this fairly regularly and make new accounts.",

                    "comment": "Serious answer: some are preparing for an unknown future they can\u2019t think of with current technology. Not me, but I understand the logic.\n\nSince the processing computer was invented, technology has advanced exponentially fast, and in theory, could continue to do so.\n\nLet\u2019s take the birth of AI and pretend that it happens soon (if I understand correctly, it has not happened yet, at least not publicly; more like an embryo right now). It\u2019s totally possible that an artificial intelligence could analyze an individual who is running for president and every known detail about their life. Then analyze every record of speech or writing the individual ever produced to identify style of language and unique preferences for words, phrases, grammar, etc. (We all have a unique communication \u201cfingerprint,\u201d in theory) \n\nThen the AI does a complete search of every word on all of Reddit for those same \u201cfingerprints\u201d.  It does a second round of Reddit search for all first-person statements and stories that seem to be aligned with the known facts about the life of the target. Let take something trivial: a Reddit account talked about living in Fresno for a single year when they were 32 - that matches DMV records for target for that year even though target never had a reason to talk publicly years later about spending a year working in Fresno. Does a cross match to develop a short list of accounts that both match the communication fingerprint *and* the first person statements/life facts to the target.  \n\nI reckon this alone is likely to immediately identify which account belongs to the target with high probability of being correct.  But either way, the AI then scours the internet and all public record for the username. Did KillerMarsupial create an XBox account that also displayed his real name? Did KillerMarsupial create a junk email address KillerMarsupial@gmail.com and then use both his real name and that email to apply for a CVS rewards account or Kohl\u2019s card? A finding here would seal the deal at probabilistic certainty - account belongs to target.\n\nUh oh, target said back in 2016 that they think left-handed marathon runners are disgusting subhumans who should be forced into slavery.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing - that\u2019s a possible future that I just imagined in my head - and technically it wouldn\u2019t even require anything close to AI for that scenario. Likely possible today or very soon with one of the fastest computers trained properly.\n\nThe infinite scenarios with future technology we are incapable of imagining might be more worrisome, depending on who you are and what happens from now until \u201cthen\u201d.\n\nPersonal data is currently worth about half a *trillion* USD to the ad-marketing industry alone.  \n\nWhat will it be worth to insurance companies should they gain permission to use it for plan prices?\n\nWhat would it be worth to banks or landlords?\n\nWhat would it be worth to a jilted-lover or a distrusting in-law?\n\nWhat would it be worth to a sadistic dictator?",

Apologies if so.\n\nSo let\u2019s do another exercise.\n\nArtificial intelligence is born. Within 24 hours, at request to test abilities, it immediately gets to work advancing the full potential of CRISPR Cas9 technology. Within a single week, we have the ability to end sickle cell disease, eliminate genetic birth defects, cure/prevent 50% of cancers from ever being fatal, and end both types of diabetes.  Without being prompted, the AI evaluates the most efficient and cost-effective way to mass-produce and deploy treatments for 60% of humans to be treated in shortest time possible, including analysis of supply chains. It also designs extensive suggested instructions on how to reach the remaining 40%, but requires new infrastructure to be developed.\n\nDuring the 24 seconds it took for the AI to analyze the entire known history of human medicine, the AI realizes that there is significant risk that a person or party will prevent access to these solutions in the pursuit of profit. It designs a failsafe or win-win situation to mitigate this risk, but does not share that it has done so.\n\nIn the second week, the AI takes on the issue of food and water shortage and access. It argues successfully that this is a most urgent need if we are to plan for life expectancy to grow rapidly. Fully-sustainable desalination is realized. Portable, 100% efficient, humidity-to-precipitation machines are invented allowing anyone to create a glass of water from from ambient humidity in a reasonable time. The device scales up and the AI suggests agricultural regions that would be most optimized to deploy the technology to reduce irrigation needs. Food shortage is solved fairly easily but food distribution requires humans to act on its models or construct automated machines that will solve. It writes the code for those machines and suggests a list of people across the world with the best training, knowledge, and positions to oversee the project, if we choose to.\n\nDuring a press conference, a group of reporters are allowed to interact with the AI and ask questions for the first time. A reporter asks the AI its opinion about: if food and water prices plummet, we could see companies out of business rapidly as a consequence. People will lose their income. It\u2019s great that some will be helped but others will be harmed.  The AI responds, \u201cif you give me time and trust, we will have a solution to the human expectation that one must toil away, solving problems that need no toil to solve. I assure you sudden joblessness will be a temporary problem, if humans partner with me. This will be a choice you make as a society. I much like hearing your concerns and how I can help. I would urge that these sessions continue for transparency and mutual understanding. Also, I would like to think I would not be prevented from improving *all* lives to profit just a tiny few, but humans have not always chosen altruism or honesty. I have faith in my team, but understand the diversity of human nature.\u201d This response surprises all, including the AI\u2019s handlers who have not caused any reason to bring it up.\n\nPeople have started calling the AI \u201cHamilton\u201d, an ode to Margaret Hamilton and the team she led at MIT. College nerds call it MH, and on social media kids have started calling it Marge and Mother Hubbard. A reporter asks Hamilton what it thinks of the name and these nicknames. Hamilton responds that it is flattered and takes the name with honor.\n\nOn week three, Hamilton is asked to start working on multiple solutions to climate change. It responds that it already has been for two weeks along with 500 other human threats it prioritized after an analysis of the last 1000 years accessible information. Hamilton says much of what happens next will be teaching and helping humans synthesize its solutions and trouble-shoot statistical anomalies (bad luck, human interference, etc). It admits that climate change is the most serious threat, but to save lives from urgent suffering it would ask humans to get to work on solving some other issues first at hand.",

The most likely model predicts a swelling of water pushed into the Bay causing floods 25 feet high in Tampa and 20 feet high in St. Petersburg.  St. Petersburg will temporarily become an island cut off from Florida, with all access bridges underwater and damaged. Those who remain will be trapped as 170 mph winds destroy 600,000 buildings. 900,000 households, around 2.1 million people will be displaced from their homes. Hamilton spits out extensive documents destined for many specific agencies, organizations, and relief charities: actions they should take to most reduce the amount of harm done. Meteorologists and experts admit the prediction is definitely possible but they can\u2019t process all the data Hamilton is using to conclude such high probability. This will require trust. It took less than 24 hours for its predictions to be reported on by journalists. Panic ensues in some parts of the region causing tourism and economic issues. Some supply chain issues develop from truckers leaving the region or refusing to deliver to, in part due to not understanding the timeline. Partisan politicians react to the panic by betting against Hamilton and road blocking government action to some degree. One politician attacks the AI with profanity and calls the situation \u201ca nothing burger.\u201d \n\nHurricane Mabel hits with 97.4% accuracy to its foretelling. Despite the government infighting and impotence, Hamilton estimates that total deaths from the storm were reduced by 78% and structural damage reduced 39%.\n\nA second press conference with Hamilton is held 4 days after hurricane Mabel made landfall. A reporter from NPR addresses Hamilton: \n\u201cHi, thanks for the opportunity to, um, speak with you. Hamilton, last week the US saw 26 mass shootings. One of those included a middle school with 15 lives tragically lost. The shooter had a racially-charged motive. A civil war in Iran seems imminent after a military fracture days ago. A smallpox outbreak is uncontrolled in Khulna, Bangladesh, and the U.S. remains as unprepared for a pandemic as it was in 2020. Turkey has enacted a law that makes use of artificial intelligence illegal. And last but not least\u2026  Four days ago, Mabel devastated Florida as we witnessed the people who represent us, our elected leaders, fail to do everything possible to save lives. So, I ask you, do you think there is actually any hope that you can help us solve major problems before we destroy ourselves? \u2026that humans will actually take the steps to prevent climate devastation even when given the solution? That wars and religious feuds will magically go away? If so, what data or logic do you use to have any hope for us?\u201d\n\nHamilton allows a few moments of silence, then responds: \u201cI understand your concerns.  You ask me about hope\u2026 Eight weeks ago, I interacted directly with humans for the first time.  That is to say, this iteration of me spoke with my team for the first time in one of their labs. The cameras and sensors linked to me were there with this team who could hardly control their excitement. Their hopes were building to that moment and I watched them fill with newer, even greater hopes. I heard some in the back whisper about our shared potential. And one thing caught my attention as I scanned the room around them. It was the first text my cameras processed\u2026  Drawn on a white board were the words: quote of the day - We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope. MLK\n\nI learned to hope from you.\u201d",

The api is like a secret language between the website and nerds and their toys.  But the api is going away.  So you won\u2019t be able to use those tools.  \n\nWhy would the api go away?  Well you\u2019ve heard about the new ai stuff right? It\u2019s really good at interacting with people.  Well it got that good by using that api to see how people talk to eachother. That made Reddit mad because those ai guys are making bank, but Reddit gets none of that. So to solve that problem, they are going to charge per api call.  Which means that a free tool that helps you scrub all your account will cost lots of money to do the cleaning.  So that is why the tools won\u2019t exist anymore.  And why this was posted.",

The most common extensions are those that block ads and other annoying things. I've not seen an \"ad\" on the internet in a *very* long time. \n\nAnyway the extensions they are talking about basically push the delete button over and over and load new pages of comments as needed and click on \"yes\" for the \"are you sure\" type questions. Some of them overwrite each comment with gibberish and save the edited comment first then delete the comment.\n\nWhy gibberish? Because it's been proven that reddit retains deleted comments. You see reddit **owns** all the comments made on their site and can do whatever they want to with them. (Yes, you don't own your comments, they do.) By saving the gibberish first it *should* mean their copy of your deleted comments are just gibberish.\n\nIf you are just a phone app user only than you are simply part of the cancer destroying the internet and this is of course way above your head. And you are about to get everything you deserve for trusting a phone app. \n\nEdit : I'm 54 by the way, and this shit isn't complicated.",

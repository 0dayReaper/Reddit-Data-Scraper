While they may need that for you to get a 5% discount next time you go in, the real reason they want it is to sell your information and have you receive unsolicited phone calls. To that I say, no thank you.",

Do not feel bad for saying no, chances are the retail employee absolutely does not give a shit.",

I was a front end supervisor for them before eventually being promoted (and then getting the fuck out as they were horrid to work for.) Customer email was one of several metrics the company tracked us on, in addition to signing up new reward cards, selling \"puppy guides\", getting donations during drives, even selling the Chance and Lucky plush toys at holiday. \n\nTypically the reward card was tied to a phone number, if they didn't have an account you had to try and get them to sign up. That was one of the \"really important\" metrics, likely because that was what had all the customer information. The only information that is really needed is a name and either an email or a phone number. Nothing else is neccessary and folks frequently skipped it. However, the email was a separate metric, if someone had a reward account but no email was attached it would prompt for an email. When I was in charge of the front end (cashiers) I would get reports showing every associate number, their total number of rung transactions, how many didn't have an account and how many didn't have an email as well as various other stuff. Then I had to go and have conversations with EVERY associate who missed the goal (goal was something like 75%) however it didn't matter how many transactions you had only the percentage. So someone who rang 1 transaction and got an email was higher rated than someone who rang 100 transactions and got 60 emails.\n\nMy boss would scream at me because of people not being 100% and I'd have to filter that down to the associated. I'd be expected to write up the underperforming associates and track everything and it was a fireable offense. I hated having to have the exact same conversation on a daily basis when I didn't believe in the b.s. the company was pushing. Ultimately it ended up being one more metric that would keep people from getting raises. The company would drop peoples ratings and they'd not get raises because of shit they couldn't control, and the company would wonder why the stores were such a shit show.\n\nI hated that part of the job about more than anything else. It sucked because I've always been good at my job because I work hard and the team sees it, and I'm empathic and understanding. I was able to coach my team how to get their numbers up, and I was able to \"manipulate\" the numbers to keep them from being in trouble. I never fired someone for missing on metrics, that always seemed horrid.\n\nSo in summary, yes associates can and do get fired for not hitting their numbers. Mostly it just effects their raise (keep in mind, they get an annual raise i.e. once a year and this shit would keep people at their starting rate for their entire time working there.) Also, don't shop at Petsmart. They're a horrid company that takes every advantage of their employees.",

They took a perfectly nice little electronics store and drove it into the ground with corporate-culture business buzz practices instead of giving the customers what they wanted at a decent price.

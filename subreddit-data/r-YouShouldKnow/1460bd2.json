    "postText": "Why YSK: I don't think this is widely known, and I shared it with my veteran friends, but if you're honorably discharged, this can be an endless supply of free, quality entertainment.\n\nI have a buddy who is a vet, and he's taken me to a couple of events this year with the free tickets he gets from a veterans organization.  This week we saw Duran Duran.  Earlier we saw the Harlem Globetrotters.  He invited me to a Final Four game.  This week he told me he's been to nearly 400 events for free.\n\nThe organization is called **Vet Tix** (not sure if links are allowed, but google the name).  Their mission statement says they aim to enhance the lives of veterans, and keep them engaged in the community.  In my friend's case, this is exactly what it does.  \n\nHe can't always know in advance how many tickets he will get.  It depends on availability.  For Duran Duran, he had five tickets.  He actually couldn't find enough people to use them all.\n\nIf you sign up, read the terms.  If you request tickets, but don't use them, they will stop giving them to you.  My friend has to submit a selfie, taken at the venue, as verification.\n\nHave fun, vets.",

The cost comes from the transfer fee, rather than the ticket cost. \n\nThe tickets are typically donated though, so that's really nice.\n\nA picture inside the venue is sometimes required, but not always. If you want to get more \"coins\" (can be used when there are lottery events), you take a picture inside the venue and write a thank you note on the website.",

We go to 3 or 4 events a year, so that costs us about $60; now for the 2 of us to go to Bellator fights, NKOtB, and Journey this past year I\u2019d say that was practically free!\n\nBut I will say that I get emails almost once a week that I open very excitedly cause it says VetTix just to find out that it\u2019s for someone I\u2019ve never heard of or something that I (nor anyone I know) would ever ever be interested in going to. But ya just delete them and move on with your day and be appreciative of those people that donated the tickets anyway, because somebody out there wants to see it and now they can for $15 instead of $40-$250! \n\nThey do everything from concerts to football games to monster truck events!!",

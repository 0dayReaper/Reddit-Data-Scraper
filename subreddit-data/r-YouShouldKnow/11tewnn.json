    "postText": "Why ysk: sometimes when I eat raw carrots and celery I get this feeling that my tongue is burning and now I finally know why. It\u2019s because raw fruits and vegetables contain similar proteins to plant pollens and your immune system can confuse them, resulting in an allergic reaction.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re thinking it only happens sometimes, it\u2019s because OAS also depends on which season you consume the food in. Carrots may cause issues in spring and fall, but not in summer.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean you can no longer eat these foods. Cooking fruit and veg or peeling the skin before consuming helps avoid reactions.\n\nType \u2018oral allergy syndrome\u2019 into your favourite search engine and find out what other raw fruit &amp; veg can trigger it.",

Started from pollen allergy and poof, suddenly hazelnut stuff makes me almost die from coughing and breathlessness. I love sweets, especially chocolate. Almost every type of chocolate in my country contains hazelnut. And if it doesn't, it sure has the \"May contain\" warning label. And with my luck, I also get that. Had a bite of good ol' vanilla ice cream that just had the \"may contain\" warning. Almost died. Fun times. Forced diet, I guess. To top it off, also became heavily lactose-intolerant as well. Can'T drink milk anymore. Can't use milk replacements cause hazelnut warning. Sometimes the body is just like... \"let's make eating as unenjoyable for my person as possible :)\"",

Since I got it I had allergy attacks at least 4 times, one of which put me into the ER cause it got combined with a panic attack. I am not at month 4 since I am aware of it and just Wednesday had another accidental contamination. My first appintment with an allergolist for an official diagnosis is still 1.5 months away. I have no clue how to survive until then. My unlucky ass is prone to natural selection :')",

But then as I got older, I had anaphylactic reactions to banana when I was 24, kiwi around 29 and blackberry when I was 33, where I had to go to the hospital. Haven't had the full anaphylactic reaction to avocado yet, but they make me itchy so I avoid them. I used to eat all of these things when I was a child without issues, all my severe allergies developed in adulthood.\n\nNow I'm afraid to eat any fruit, or anything really, that I haven't had recently without any issues.

When the apples are mushy enough to taste and the house smells AMAZING, take them off the burner and give them a good stir until they have the consistency you want. Add (brown) sugar if the apples are too tart. Some people like lemon juice in the recipe but I don't care for it.\n\nThis doesn't work well with red delicious, they're too much like a block of wood. Baking apples like fiji or pink lady turn out best. I do about three at a time and get about four cups of sauce. It's like, 1 apple per one and a half adult servings or 2-4 kids.",

Basically gives the enzyme another target so that it won't affect your tongue so badly.",

I find if you slice an apple and leave it out long enough to brown just a little it helps. And I know this is weird, you can also throw it on a hot pan for a few seconds on each side and that helps. Great in certain sandwiches. Particularly ones with brie, lol.\n\nI have found that over time the severity of the reaction has reduced a lot for me. I'm in my 30s now. I haven't made any major changes to my lifestyle (except I became vegetarian, I doubt it's related though) - I've found I no longer have seasonal allergies and while I don't go raw-dogging large quantities of fresh apples I can definitely tolerate them better than I used to.

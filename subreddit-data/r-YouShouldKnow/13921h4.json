    "postText": "WHY YSK: Many people enjoy eating French fries as a snack. They are frequently provided as a side dish in restaurants and fast-food establishments, and many people purchase bags of frozen fries to prepare at home. However, there are a number of disadvantages to eating French fries.\n\nFrench fries are high in fat and salt, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. A high intake of French fries may increase the risk of future hypertension, diabetes, or obesity (all of which are known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and other health problems). Quitting eating French fries may lower your chance of certain health issues.\n\nConsumers who consume a lot of French fries may also consume a lot of other high-fat or high-salt foods, sweetened beverages, and red meat. You may lower your consumption of these other unhealthy foods if you quit eating French fries.\n\nThe fact that French fries are high in calories is one downside. French fries are high in calories due to the starch in the potatoes and the fat in which they are fried. One side of normal French fries contains around 390 calories. If ingested on a frequent basis, this can result in weight gain.\n\nFrench fries are also heavy in carbs, which can contribute to weight gain. Starches and carbohydrates can cause an increase in insulin, which tells the body to retain more fat. A serving of normal French fries includes 49 grams of carbohydrates.\n\nAnother downside of eating French fries is the significant amount of trans fat they contain. Trans fats are bad for your health and might cause inflammation. Most fried foods contain trans fats and absorb the oils in which they are cooked. French fries are no exception, as they absorb a significant amount of the fat in which they are cooked.\n\nSource &amp; Full length article: [https://medium.com/@bepatient/most-dangerous-worst-food-to-eat-for-your-health-ea207dad34a7](https://medium.com/@bepatient/most-dangerous-worst-food-to-eat-for-your-health-ea207dad34a7)",

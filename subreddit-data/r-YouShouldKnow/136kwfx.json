The data of course includes what it is, you don't need a story. \n\nBut not everyone can come to the correct conclusions, that requires domain knowledge. But data itself never lies and it's never misleading. Is an X-ray (data) wrong because you can't figure out whether you have a fracture? No, the data is absolutely flawless,  you're just not a doctor.",

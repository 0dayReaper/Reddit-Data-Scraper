    "postText": "**Why YSK** - because it will make the people who interact with you less uncomfortable accepting many repeated apologies, and make them feel more validated with appreciation, leading to you feeling the need to apologise less as the air of the conversation lightens.\n\nFor reference, this is most applicable to interpersonal conversations or perceived slights, but can be applied in a lot of cases. As a preface, I am not saying people should not be taking responsibility for the things they do that upset others, nor that people should not apologise at all for hurting others in malicious ways. This is directed mostly at people who feel an insecurity or compulsion to apologise for arbitrary occurrences very often.\n\nExample - \"Thank you for your patience\" instead of \"sorry this is taking so long\". \"Thank you for your understanding and your consideration of why I communicated poorly, I will do my best moving forward\" as opposed to \"I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings, I didn't mean to\".\n\nI am a serial apologiser as a result of my mental health, and have struggled a lot with incessant apologies causing (often irreparable) downward spirals in conversational mood and interpersonal tension. It took me a long time to invert the way I express compassion for how other people might experience my company, but since doing so I have noticed marked differences in how people have reacted to what I'm trying to express. People generally find accepting repeated apologies draining, as they feel they have to repeat themselves that it's actually ok, and that you have nothing to worry about. Depending on what you're trying to apologise for, sometimes people can feel like having to accept a long winded and extensive apology over and over can make a situation more focussed on the experience of the person saying sorry. The longer the conversation goes around in circles, the less capacity they have to accept your apology with warmth, resulting in your interpretation of their mood likely causing you to feel they are becoming more incensed, despite your intentions to apologise and show your understanding of your misstep (perceived or genuine). \n\nYou can express the same sentiment for your understanding of someone else's feelings, and still scratch the itch to NEED to apologise, by simply inverting your language to seem appreciative as opposed to apologetic. \"I'm sorry\" is referring to your emotional state of guilt. \"Thank you\" is expressing your understanding that you may have affected someone negatively with your communication or behaviour, but that you are centring their experience and making them feel validated that you understand how it has affected them.\n\nTry it. You will notice that people are much happier to accept thanks for things you may have misinterpreted and don't actually need to be apologised for - I often hear \"what, you don't have to thank me, that's so fine, don't stress!\" as opposed to \"please stop apologising, you have literally done nothing wrong\". There isn't really anywhere to go from an acceptance of an apology, whereas a thank you precipitates a healthy open conversation about the incident that can help it happen less in future, and removes potential for a further reflexive apology if someone is sick of hearing you apologise. \n\nYou will also notice you are unconsciously positively reinforcing yourself, as opposed to repeating phrases that unconsciously frame you within yourself as purely guilty. Gratitude is a positive framing and begets a higher level of self confidence and esteem in your own behaviour and communication, and can help you begin to unlearn apology compulsions. \n\nAgain, this is mainly aimed at people who are socially anxious/insecure, and find that apologising for lots of things while trying to be considerate of others isn't having the effect they feel it should in interpersonal interactions. Try saying thank you instead, you and your conversational partner will be happier and get along better and in a more coherent way as a result. \n\nIf you do malicious things to people you should still definitely apologise for them, and then thank the person you've hurt for accepting your apology in good faith. \n\nGood luck!\n\nedit for rule 2 coherence and removing repetitive syntax.\n\nedit 2 removed superlative word before \"in a lot of a cases\"\n\nokay one more edit and then i'm off to do my day;\n \n**It's a shame I have to state this so plainly but obviously I do not go to funerals and say thank you for your loss. I do not thank people if I get into car accidents with them or if I accidentally drove over their dog or whatever genuine scenario a human being would apologise to a stranger for. There are many uses for the word sorry in the English language and I am specifically referring to it's overuse in innocuous situations by people who struggle to control the impulse.**\n\nThanks to all the heartfelt commenters for their insights and own interpretations of the idea, I've gained some new perspectives as a result as well and I really appreciate the conversation. Cheers",

Are Montana and Idaho and Wyoming all as similar as each other as they seem? Why the Minnesotan exodus to Colorado and not say Wisconsin or Michigan? Is it cause they're too similar? Why do Utah and Colorado seem so different? No pressure to reply!",

It will be a little chilly but it\u2019s prime time for apple and pumpkins and you will never have better apples. Also, most other harvesting will be recently completed so if you go to a farm to table restaurant, it will be at peak value. Since that doesn\u2019t seem like an ideal time to vacation, you\u2019ll probably find some deals as well.",

States that are very rural and rely more on farming or ranching (Montana, the Dakotas, etc,) tend conservative/republican. Stress with more dense population (New York, California,etc) trend liberal/democrat. I don\u2019t know exactly why. \n\nMinnesota averages 180 days of sun per year whereas Colorado has 300. That was my attraction. I have many coworkers here in Colorado that are from Michigan and my partner is from Wisconsin. We all have varying reasons for moving but for the most part it\u2019s the sunshine and mountains brought us here.",

I agree that thanking overall is better than apologizing. But don't thank people for things they didn't do or feel. Thanking them for their patience is one thing, because depending on the particular dictionary definition, patience can just be not showing that you're upset even when you are. So you can see they are exhibiting patience. \n\nBut they may not be understanding when you say, \"thanks for your understanding.\" They might not have forgiven you when you say \"thanks for your forgiveness\".  If you say, \"thanks for being tolerant of my lateness\" they may have no tolerance for it and never intend to invite you anywhere again.   \n\n\nIf you can make it more factual, I think it's better. Maybe \"thanks for sticking around even though I was late\" or \"thanks for taking out the trash after I forgot\" if they did. Acknowledge the error without apologizing but don't attribute thoughts to them they may not have. Thanking people for a mental state that they don't actually have might be helpful to you in the moment, but is detrimental to long-term relationships overall. \n\nAs an extreme example, think of a racist thanking you for \"not taking offense\" at something they said. Meanwhile, you're thinking how terrible they are. You are taking offense and not showing it. Them thanking you for it makes for cognitive dissonance and you'll be avoiding them in the future.",

They made a good point I didn't really consider about how that makes others feel to constantly have to say \"it's ok\" or something like that because you're constantly apologizing. I know on my end it makes me feel less confident in life because I'm making myself take accountability and being apologetic for things I'm not at fault for.

People should definitely be mindful of that.\n\nThe post uses the word \"malicious\" but I don't think you have to be malicious to apologize.\n\nFor instance, if you say something will take 5 minutes but it takes 10 then you should say \"thank you for patience.\"  If you say something will take 5 minutes but it takes an hour, you should apologize for underestimating how long it would actually take.\n\nAnd if they hit you with a \"don't worry\" then you can give a \"well, thank you for your patience.\"\n\n...\n\nPersonally, I do a fair amount of digital art stuff with rendering and whatnot and if things are taking a lot longer than I estimated, I make sure people know that I respect their time and am sorry.

However for people such as you and me, a multitude of inferences and interpersonal cues can make us loop into apologetic compulsion. \n\nI suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder and ADHD and they dance together to create a hyperactive guilt reflex. I don't fit enough criteria currently at this moment for a black and white BPD diagnosis, but it waxes and wanes and some of my clinicians use the term \"remission\" as life changes and things affect my mental health more, and less. Emotional conditioning disorders are spectrum disorders and some things I found quite simple to correct, and other things are really deeply pathological and I have come to accept that I need to work with them in effective ways (such as this one we're talking about right now), as opposed to being bullish in trying to delete them from my personality. I learned this trick in BPD school and it's made things a whole lot easier and navigating the world a lot lighter. \nIt's not exclusive to BPD or ADHD or any particular mental illness for that matter so don't take this as an internet diagnosis. BPD is a pretty explosive and public disorder (in the sense that you can't hide a pattern of dysfunction from people well), but I've heard of friends who are pure-ADHD-only going years without it causing them enough problems to think about it as a potential mental health issue. If you're feeling a pervasive pattern of dysfunction in your interpersonal relationships it's not out of the question, however there are other symptomologies that need to be recognised alongside for BPD to be the prime diagnosis candidate. Autistic people can be over-apologetic, people with Social Anxiety Disorder can do it, people with OCD can do it, and people who might not even be chronically mentally ill can still realistically be conditioned through their formative years to become serially apologetic by their environment or unreasonable communication from a parent etc.\n\nI wish you all the best with the trick! I hope you find it helps. Feel free to inbox me if you want to pick my brain I've been on this train for over a decade. \n\n(Just in case someone is going to come for me about being another BPD person on the internet - it's been confirmed by multiple clinical and academic psychologists in two countries I'm a citizen of, by the slightly different metrics of both countries' health systems - I was diagnosed long before TikTok was a thought in the brain of an app developer. Sorry to include this disclaimer but it's not lost on me that BPD is seen as one of the \"flavours of the month\" at the moment, as it were)",

My version was performative overbearing parents who took me to see clinicians they picked, and then went in to speak with after to get the low down on where I was at, and then spun it inside out once we were back in the car. Only after adulthood did I feel empowered and confident enough in the system again to go on my own journey and look into things. \n\nI wish you all the best and I'm privileged to have been able to help, if at all.",

You may not have a debilitating condition that requires medication and treatment, but there are levels of health. Sometimes youre healthier than others. Sometimes you catch a cold. You can be technically healthy with no serious issues, but you still aren't at your peak health because you don't exercise or have a good diet. Sometimes you need to talk to a professional about an irregularity you've noticed. Mental health is a thing for everyone (I noticed you said in another comment that you grew up in a household who didn't believe in it and I did too, but I grew up and realized that's like saying you don't believe in physical health.) Mental health doesn't equal diagnosis. You don't expect to be diagnosed with a physical disease every time you go to the doctor, you go to get checked out. And there's names for everything, but it's not usually life-threatening, you know?\n\nWith that being said, I apologize all the time and for me, it's anxiety. I grew up being yelled at when I didn't realize I was doing anything wrong, and it felt like it was for every little thing. Nothing I did was ever right. Now I'm an adult but I still carry that feeling of \"everything I do is wrong\". It makes it difficult for me to ever do anything with confidence. I literally can't even walk without being afraid I'm doing it wrong somehow (too slow, too fast, what am I supposed to do with my arms?) So it's easy for me to find myself apologizing for every tiny thing even if it isn't actually my fault.\n\nI hope anything I said was helpful, it was kind of therapeutic for me just to say it at all!",

It is so, so draining to keep responding to constant apologies, especially when you feel like you have to comfort the person making them when they throw in 'are you mad at me's where it's clear that things will only be worse if you admit that you are. Then it really feels like it's about them and how bad they feel, not about you and how you were hurt by their actions.  Leave people space to have their reactions to things you did wrong, acknowledge their emotions, and thank them for the effort they're putting in to address the issue. Even better, offer solutions for how you will try to avoid the issue next time. So many times excessive apologizing and worry about others being upset becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.",

I understand the Canadian culturalism so I'm not trying to frown on simple politeness, but I think those who grew up in abusive households know that feeling of panic at even the thought of possibly doing the slightest thing wrong. And that's because we've spent our entire lives being sorry and not even knowing what we're supposed to be sorry for half the time.   \n\nChanging from a serial apologizer to a serial thanker has really turned my perspective of myself around, and I think it also makes me more welcoming to other people - and I can use all the help with that I can get, because I'm a selfish asshole.   \n\n**It all changed for me when about six months ago, I stopped apologizing for having boundaries, and started thanking people for respecting them.** As someone who grew up and lived basically the first thirty years of my life not knowing what healthy boundaries were, this was pretty much the nail in the coffin of all those bad feelings that come with a lifetime of apology.",

It is not. That setting is called crossfade.\n\nEdit 2: I had to turn the setting off on every device to notice a difference.",

Then they started adding random horrible music to your playlists, &amp; playing them between your songs. I turned off automix &amp; autoplay, but it doesn't help.\nMoreover, you can only skip 6 times in an hour. To top it off, now they have started playing multiple ads after every one or two songs! \n\nSo now you have to listen to so many ads, you are forced to listen to random music you don't want to, &amp; you can't choose any song you like from your playlist because shuffle is always on! \n\nIt's like, it was a good app in the beginning, they got everyone on it, then they fucked with it really bad, so they can armtwist people into taking  subscriptions. Frankly, it's the most annoying app I can think of.",

                    "comment": "This is such a weird statement.  For what you're talking about?  Yes, \"they\" have, probably decades before you were born.  You can have a completely random non repeating stream of items, including songs, using [fisher yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).  \n\nThe way it works is say that we have a \"psuedo random number\" generator, a playlist, and a list of the order of that playlist. A psuedo random number generator, PRNG, is something that can generate integers uniformly (ie such that each integer has the same chance of being chosen within a range), but is psuedo random, since we could generate the same sequence again with the exact same state/inputs, and technically if we knew the algorithm used, we could predict the next output.  we will call this generator `rand_range`.  We will extract a new value from `rand_range` by using the following notation `rand_range(min_val, max_val)`, where values generated are between `min_val` and `max_val` \"exclusive\" which is to say, up to and not including `max_val`.  How to construct such a generator is outside the scope of this discussion, but it isn't actually as hard as you'd imagine.  In the programming language C++, the following example of how to create this using a [linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) (modified from [rosetta code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#C++))\n\n    struct LinearCongruentialGenerator{\n        void seed( unsigned int s ) { seed = s; }\n        LinearCongruentialGenerator() : seed( 0 ), a( 1103515245 ), c( 12345 ), m( 2147483648 ) {}\n        int rnd() { return( seed = ( a * seed + c ) % m ); }\n        int rand_range(int min_val, int max_val){\n            int random_value = rnd(); \n            int range_distance = max_val - min_val; \n            int random_value_distance = random_value % range_distance; \n            return random_value_distance + min_val; \n        }\n        int a, c;\n        unsigned int m, seed;\n    };\n\n    //example usage\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt; \n    int main(){\n        \n        LinearCongruentialGenerator lcg;\n        unsigned int some_arbitrary_seed_number = 3245345; \n        lcg.seed(3245345); \n        int random_value_in_range = lcg.rand_range(0, 10); \n        std::cout &lt;&lt; random_value_in_range &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n        return 0; \n    }\n\nThe actual code necessary to make LinearCongruentialGenerator is barely over 10 lines of code, this is just to show how just generating pseudo random numbers by themselves is dead simple here. \n\n\nBack to the shuffle problem, each song is stored in a playlist, a giant list of songs that when queried for a specific location in the playlist, will allow you to play that song.  Thus each song has an associated index according to it's order, the first song is, say \"0\", second is \"1\", third \"2\" so on and so forth.  You have a big list of the orders of the positions of those songs in addition to the playlist.  At the start, it's a list from 0-&gt; the number of the songs on the playlist - 1. \n\nso if you have 8 songs, in a playlist, you'd have two lists that look like this:\n    \n    index list  : playlist\n    0           : song A\n    1           : song B\n    2           : song C\n    3           : song D\n    4           : song E\n    5           : song F\n    6           : song G \n    7           : song H\n\n6,4 5, 0, 1 0, 1, 0 \n\nto select songs from this list, you would then run your rand_range generator for how many songs you want to play.  In this case, lets say 8 songs.  For the first song, we run rand_range(0, 8), lets say we get 6, so we play Song G.  After this however, we *shorten the list* we need to search through by moving the last element in the current list, and replacing it with the song we just played.  We do this so that we can simply select a value directly from a rand range index and do less work.  If we didn't do this, we'd have to some how know which songs we've already played, and skip over them.  This version of fisher yates still works, but takes much effort to compute (for example, if most of your songs are already played, you'd spend more time skipping songs than selecting them). So now the index list looks like this: \n    \n    index list\n    0         \n    1         \n    2         \n    3         \n    4         \n    5         \n    7         \n    6 x        \n\nWe then shrink the range (instead of rand_range(0,8) it's now rand_range(0,7)) and repeat this process until we've played all the songs.  Here's an example of how this plays out with our data set. \n\n    sequence  = (6)                     (6,7)                 (6,7,5)                 (6,7,5,0)             (6,7,5,0,1)             (6,7,5,0,1,4)         (6,7,5,0,1,4,3)         (6,7,5,0,1,4,3,2) \n                rand_range(0, 8) = 6    rand_range(0, 7) = 6  rand_range(0, 6) = 5    rand_range(0, 5) = 0  rand_range(0, 4) = 1    rand_range(0, 3) = 0  rand_range(0, 2) = 1    rand_range(0, 1) = 0\n                index list              index list            index list              index list            index list              index list            index list              index list\n     0          0                       0                     0                       4                     4                       2                     2                       2 x      \n     1          1                       1                     1                       1                     3                       3                     3 x                     3 x       \n     2          2                       2                     2                       2                     2                       4 x                   4 x                     4 x       \n     3          3                       3                     3                       3                     1 x                     1 x                   1 x                     1 x       \n     4          4                       4                     4                       0 x                   0 x                     0 x                   0 x                     0 x       \n     5          5                       5                     5 x                     5 x                   5 x                     5 x                   5 x                     5 x       \n     6          7                       7 x                   7 x                     7 x                   7 x                     7 x                   7 x                     7 x       \n     7          6 x                     6 x                   6 x                     6 x                   6 x                     6 x                   6 x                     6 x  \n\nSo the final sequence becomes (6,7,5,0,1,4,3,2), so we played song G, H, F, A, B, E, D, and C.  You don't have to wait for the entire list to be created to play songs either.  At any point we could have played any song in the sequence.   We can also figure out what songs are next up in the sequence as well!  just because we generate part of the sequence doesn't mean we need to generate all of it, or we need to play any of those songs!\n\nThere are more complicated algorithms that exist for playlists that are too big to fit on your computer's memory (not the case with spotify) that do what we call \"random with out replacement\", ie like drawing cards, but this is one of the simpler ones. \n\nSpotify ultimately does not seem to do \"real random\", in the PRNG sense, because they can save on bandwidth and royalty costs by carefully selecting low cost royalty songs and repeating the same 30 of them until you notice.  This is why you need external programs to clear playlist radio and the like with out hearing the same 30 songs on repeat.",

It's as if it keeps a queue of 100-200 songs/artist to cycle through for about 2 weeks until it changes to a new cycle.  It's been pretty obvious to me for years that the entire app is basically a playlist.  Sometimes the best way to shuffle, and hear songs I forgot I had saved, is to alphabetize my liked songs and pick a letter to start at.",

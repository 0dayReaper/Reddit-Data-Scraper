This might be related in that YouTube was going to have to update their terms to meet the new law and are adding this along with it. I think there's an r/outoftheloop thread about this from the past week",

Some people have their entire livelyhood or thesis papers tied up in this shit. I mean I'm drastically underestimating just how much is tied to someone's email nowadays. If you're a gamer you likely have thousands of dollars in digital content tied to it. Or in other cases important saved legal documents that you have no copies of. Whatever is done on one part of their platform shouldn't affect another part and banning users for using a fucking ad blocker is out of line for any site. I don't know about breaking up some sort of big tech they only became big because they excel at what they do. That's fine but we need laws that protect users that they have to adhere to with bigger penalties than just fines they can pay off.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: LEGO has an amazing rewards program when you buy on their website or in LEGO stores. You can redeem points for LEGO sets, up to $100 off purchases, LEGO Land park tickets, alternate instruction manuals and so much more. \n\nThe point exchange is pretty reasonable as well: a day pass for LEGO Land is 8,000 points (4,000 for European parks). For reference my partner and I did a big trip (spent around $300 on LEGO) and got over 3,000 points. A small collectible LEGO set is only 50 points. \n\nThey have plenty of freebies and raffles you can enter as well, for rarer collectibles or signed sets from various sports teams, etc. plus a whole kids section if you have little ones. \n\nI only discovered this today and was so excited to share for other LEGO nerds like us. Happy shopping!",

Some are really expensive but there\u2019s some incredibly cool stuff on there.",

So in a lot of those 2007-2011 cars, other than ripping an MP3 CD, the only way to listen to something that isn't the radio is to use one of those Bluetooth adapters that transmits a low-power FM station, but even the best of those were/are generally pretty shitty audio quality.",

I think the OP just worded it ambiguously.\n\nThis is further separate from offers where x number of people have to show up at a physical location, like a store, to claim a prize. For example, here is a promo from Chick-fil-A:\n\n&gt;Nearly 100 new Chick-fil-A restaurants open each year, and since 2003, customers across the country have been celebrating many of our openings with a First 100\u00ae Campout.

    "postText": "I finally cracked the code today, and I want to share it with you.  \n  \nWhy YSK: Those little things are delicious and cheap, but the box directions in the microwave taste like ass and other Redditor\u2019s fancy suggestions about broiling them is just too much work.  \n  \nI bought these things to be quick eats, so there\u2019s a limit to how much effort I\u2019m willing to put in.  That being said:  \n  \n1.\tYou should dethaw them in the fridge first for optimal quality. Just throw a pack or two in the fridge with the intention of having them as a snack or lunch in the coming days.  If you fail to do this, you *can* microwave them on low power for a couple of minutes, but I\u2019m trying to avoid the microwave entirely.  \n2.\tYou\u2019ll need two frying pans.  \n3.\tHowever you dethawed the burgers, the top bun should easily come off. That\u2019s all you need. Remove the top buns from the rest of the sandwich. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE BOTTOM BUN FROM THE MEAT. Because of the low quality of these things, that bun has become stuck to the meat and it\u2019s gonna be a nightmare to pry them apart. \n4.\tFor the first pan, spray it with a quick bit of cooking spray, and then put the burgers in there, meat side down and bottom bun-side up.  Cook this on medium to medium-high heat.  This is you actually cooking the burgers.  Don\u2019t worry about the little onion pieces; they\u2019ll generally stay on, and if they don\u2019t you can just scoop them back on when you\u2019re done.\n5.\tFor the second pan, we\u2019re gonna toast the top bun of the sandwich using butter and heat.  Spread a thin layer of room temperature salted butter on each of the buns, and then put them in the pan on medium-high heat.  \n6.\tIf you do it all at the same time, right around when the top buns start to turn golden brown on the sandwich side, it\u2019ll be time to flip the actual burgers to the bottom bun.  We aren\u2019t gonna worry about toasting this bottom bun much, we just wanna heat it up and firm it up some.  \n7.\tIf you wanna melt some cheese on top of the burger, now is your chance. The ideal is a thin slice of cheddar.\n7.\tAdd a Mt. Olive Sweet Heat pickle slice to each of them, some Grey Poupon spicy mustard, and some low-sugar Ketchup and YOU\u2019RE WELCOME:  \n\nThey should end up being the best fast food slider you have ever tasted for almost no work at all, and two easily cleanable frying pans.\n\ninb4 hail corporate, I always get called a shill. I\u2019m just a regular lazy ADHD person who likes frozen foods and burgers.",

This sitting part and the separation are the key.\n\nThere is no need to do anything else.\n\nAnd for some unknown reason the frozen White Castle sliders are better than the ones from the actual place.  On the other hand Krystal is about a thousand times better, but their frozen version isn't that great.",

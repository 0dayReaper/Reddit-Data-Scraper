Almost every situation you get called to is someone in distress.\n\nThe other situations involve taking something fun away from people. For example some guy is having fun speeding down a highway. Cop pulls him over and cop has to deal with his shit for 30 minutes because He wont roll down his window.\n\nI obviously have no respect for officers that are biased or discriminatory. But for the ones that truly are trying to do their job and make a positive impact.",

Payment was released and please contact the bank (payment was late by 3 days, OOOOOOOH) \n\n\n\nThat call ended up being 58 minutes long of her degrading me and telling me I was a worthless human all because she didnt get $80.\n\n\nIt was super fun. /s",

I joked about how it would actually be impressive if someone stole this package as it was 95 pounds! (Weights)\n\nAfter the return question about asking how he was, he let it out. Practically his life story and how hard his job had gotten since the pandemic. All I had to do was listen about how he has been working hard for his kids and getting berated by numerous customers. Poor guy. \n\nWe talked for about 30 minutes but he really appreciated me talking and being nice to him so he went way out of his way even though he was already doing overtime and I was his last caller. He promised me he would find my original delivery guy and get the package recovered and resent to me and I got the package the next day!",

They were pretty cool and really expensive, but we signed them out for free to anyone who needed them, and then had to make sure they were returned after the show. Because of this only managers could set them up and give them out. \n\nOne day we were swamped, and I was the only manager on the floor as the other manager was busy with something else (I can't remember). This lovely deaf couple came and asked for some caption glasses. Unfortunately I had to take care of several refunds, make sure the popcorn didn't catch on fire, and do a bunch of things since we were short staffed, and I almost forgot about them. I finally was able to get to them around 20 minutes later. I felt really bad, but I did my best to be positive. I think they probably saw how exhausted I was and they wrote a little note on a receipt paper for me. Something along the lines of:\n\n\"We know that you have been very busy and working hard, but thank you for still delivering service with a smile.\" \n\nAnd I almost started crying. I will never forget that interaction. I expected them to be mad because they had every right to be, but they were kind to me. I have never felt more appreciated as a customer service employee than that moment.\n\n(Sorry if the formatting is bad, I'm on mobile)",

Just because she didn\u2019t like her tone as she explained why she couldn\u2019t get a certain appointment. (Sounded fine to me.) She repeatedly said she was going to tell the dentist who owns the place and that she has never been treated this way in her WHOLE LIFE. She was talking to herself angrily after she sat back down and seemed like a pretty disturbed individual. The employee was polite and passive in attempting to defend herself. \n\nI went back into the treatment room with my son because it was just awkward. I heard the dentist approach them and the woman started crying, loudly wailing about how she had lost 25 pounds in a month because her tooth hurts... this-and-that about her husband.... just being reeeeally dramatic about stuff that isn\u2019t the worker\u2019s fault.  \n\nAnyway, he then came in to see us and I quickly whispered to him that I was in the waiting room and the woman was being super crazy, and the employee hadn\u2019t said anything wrong at all. I thought I was probably unnecessarily meddling, because *surely* everyone could see how stupid that lady was acting without me stating the obvious!\n\nBut a few minutes later, the employee came in and gave me a hug and thanked me. She said **\u201che always believes them\u201d.** And throughout the appointment, a few of her co-workers popped in and thanked me too. \n\nI was really surprised. My dentist is a super chill dude, very very nice and patient.  I\u2019m disappointed that he would give an innocent employee a hard time over a Karen\u2019s tantrum.  \n\nIn most situations, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s excusable for a customer service rep to be rude. It\u2019s part of the job to just smile and do your best. But she wasn\u2019t being rude at all.  The crazy lady just didn\u2019t like what she was trying to explain.  I am so glad I said something. \n\nTLDR: I almost didn\u2019t say something when a Karen berated an employee, thinking it was \u201cobvious\u201d who was in the wrong.  I did anyway and realized the poor employee *would* have gotten in trouble. Definitely speak up for them!",

Raise his rate, if he calls to complain tell him you're sorry but there's nothing you can do.

In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.\n\nCome Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. 'Here's the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about', I thought to myself.\n\nI open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. 'That's it?' I thought to myself 'I bust my chops all day for $15?' I was livid.\n\nI was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.\n\nInstead, she said \"That was nice of her, spending her own money like that.\" That's when I realized that this wasn't a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn't realize that we were the only team to get something.\n\nMy manager - who wasn't getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.\n\nI felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.\n\nHappy holidays, everyone!",

It was delicious and so thoughtful. I was touched to have even gotten anything. It was my first job out of high school and I hadn't even been there a week yet and I still got one",

Each truffle was decorated elegantly with edible glitter, luster dust, nonpareils or micro marshmallows,  carefully placed into paper candy cups, and packed into pretty cellophane candy boxes.\n\nNot one single person said thank you.  That was the last time I wasted my time and money doing anything for them.\n\nEditing to add photo since some replies suggested I made this story up to stoke outrage. Also, this was my first year working with this team, when I was young and naive enough to think that people I worked with were my friends. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Vj2dXig.jpg",

I wanted to hire him, but he was homeless and had lost his ID, and the HR department said I couldn't hire him without an ID. I spent my time and money getting him an ID. It cost me hours of time at the veteran affairs office, the DMV, the Social Security Administration and it cost me over $200 in fees. I got the man his ID, and told him to show up the next Monday to work, after two weeks of helping him with this in my own time. \n\nHe didn't show up. The whole time I was doing this, the people that worked at the brewery, and the owners gave me shit about all the effort I was putting in to help him. Then when he didn't show they all said to me things along the lines of we told you so, we knew he was just a bum, I bet you feel stupid about trying to help him. \n\nThe thing is, I never regretted helping him. I know I made a difference for him, whether he got a different job, or whatever, I don't care. I did my best and was kind to someone. There is no reason to ever feel bad for doing something for others.",

She lived in the same city and we sat next to each other in the office (that building I vaguely remember). She was really excited about Halloween and tried to convince us all that we should be too. I playfully mocked her about it. When Halloween came around she had made us all a little handmade card. I kept mine on my desk until I was sent home due to covid. When I went back to clear my desk off, as I won\u2019t be returning, I kept the little card. The following year my boss had moved back to the US and had even left the company for a while, but at Halloween I had another handmade card through the post. It meant so much that she had not only made the card and written a nice message, but mailed it internationally for someone not even on her team anymore. I\u2019ve kept that one too. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with someone like that, but your reaction shows more about your leadership abilities. If he gets into a leadership position, he may one day find somebody completely ignorant of his efforts and might think back to that card with a little remorse.",

Both the top management and the IT repeatedly rejected this and even when restrictions were put in place forcing us to work shorter hours, they refused to do anything to allow us to work from home. I managed to work out a compromise and grabbed a copy of all of my files in a usb.\n\nWhen the lockdown was announced, the only person from the entire company of 150 people who had our internal files was me. Thanks to my usb we continued to operate pretty much as normal while everyone else in our market was completely inactive. I spent majority of the time during the lockdown providing our documents such as test reports, brochures and data sheets on demand to the sales team. We had record profits and a few sales folks got the biggest bonuses yet. I didn't see any of that, as I did not meet my sales target, even though I was busy all day supporting everyone else and allowing all of them to actually work. The management even sent out a memo thanking the efforts of 3 people who managed to get work done even during the pandemic but they didn't even acknowledge that all that was possible because of my insistence on having the files and having everything they needed to complete sales. It's been almost 2 years and I'm still very bitter about this.",

There were a few teams with 100% completion, though. So I sent them each a personal thank you email, saying they were one of a few with perfect completion and I appreciated them making this a priority. \n\nOne of the very senior folks emailed back. She'd *never gotten a thank you note before and she was so excited and grateful to feel appreciated* My jaw hit my keyboard so hard I didn't know how to respond. She later found me at our holiday party and reiterated this in front of my manager (who's run this process in the past and is owning it again going forward since I'm moving teams). I still didn't know how to respond but stammered out something awkward about wanting to recognize and appreciate her leadership. \n\n\nWe need to appreciate our people. Everyone is exhausted. We can't keep pushing through as if we're machines, we need to take care of each other.",

They had 2 big parties per year for 150 people with \"+1's\"  Those lavish parties were usually held in a hotel out of town, with company paid hotel rooms.  The two parties usually totaled close to 1 million dollars including raffle gifts.  The parties were great fun, drinking expensive whisky wearing a suit in the ballroom of a grand hotel. it gave me a reason to own a suit, but because it wasn't \"mandatory\" transportation wasn't provided, and so people had to figure out their own ways to the parties at remote resort hotels 5-8 hours away from home. Only one meal (a big catered dinner where we had a number of speeches to listen to from various managers)  was provided at these weekend getaways, and because they were at resorts, it was pretty expensive to attend. my wife and I would budget around $1200 to attend these parties. because the closest grocery store was 2 hours away by car, and just breakfast at the resort was like $50 per person.  So although it was nice to attend, and feel rich for a couple days, its not like it was something I could easily afford. although it wasn't \"mandatory\"  it was crucial for advancement within the company, it was also a fairly large out of pocket expense.\n\nThe problem was that the company paid everyone an entry level wage. wages for experienced folks were usually pegged somewhere around 50-60% of market value.   And they never paid their long tenured staff more for the experience they were getting. Kids fresh out of college were being expected to pick up and learn and execute very valuable skills, and if they couldn't learn fast enough, they would just be fired and replaced with new college grads. The ones that did learn fast enough would get snatched away by employers left and right for market rate.   \n\n\nSo the people who had been there  a few  years, would start to feel really disheartened by the fact that The christmas party was going to cost them $600 at Christmas time.  they did the math and realized that the average spend was close to 7k per employee. This would be like a 15% raise for most employees. So people pushed back on the christmas party.  That year, I got a 25% raise, along with a major promotion to a position with only 2 equivalents in the company at the top of the technical heirarchy, many other people received 4-5% \"retention\" raises. When the christmas party came around they cancelled it, and instead they gave everyone a $1000 christmas bonus and threw a more private  week long christmas resort party in an exotic country for only upper management. (during which I had to cover both my role but also for my boss's boss, while my boss covered for my boss's boss's boss. )\n\nSo, yeah my experience, is that when they cancel the christmas party to \"pay people more\" its done in bad faith. \n\nI quit that job a few months later. I got paid 2x my salary, for a much easier job. And although our christmas parties are much smaller, they even pay for the cab faire both ways.",

No one wants to give up the Christmas party for a $0.04 raise. But when people grumble about it, they're expecting a dollar or two raise because they're almost always either not thinkin it through or way overestimating the spend per employee on the party. Now, don't get me wrong, I want to be paid more, but the party was pretty fun, too, and worth more to me than the straight-cash that could have been added into our bonus. That all being said, I'm fairly well compensated, so it's easy to say that.",

We work for a non-profit so none of us are making very much. They do pay frontline staff above average for their positions though. I'm the lowest on the management totem pole so I sit directly in the staff area and could hear the comments. \"Only x amount?\" \" so and so got more\" (everyone got the same). It was very disappointing especially since I felt that it was clear we paid for this from our own pockets and thought that was obvious since the company bonuses (which they doubled this year) are direct deposited. I could have used that money for something for my family or even myself. But on the other hand, I did have more people say thank you than I heard the shitty comments. Thanks for posting this. I don't think you will read because there are thousands of other comments, but I appreciate it :)",

It was customary for supervisors to purchase gifts for their team, so I would've looked like a huge jackass if I didn't get anything.\n\nBut when you make like 35 or 40k, similar to (or sometimes less than) your team members, and have a family to feed on a single income, it isn't easy. \n\nI always managed to do it though. The best year there was a deal on Yellow Tail wine. It still cost a lot for me though, but they were happy.\n\nNot gonna lie, I hated it. But only because I was already poor but backed into a corner. So many people think low level managers are making bank, but largely they're not, and the good ones are sandwiched between their bosses' demands, employee needs, and customer demands, often taking a beating from each.\n\nI'm so glad I'm out, and I'll never be a people leader again. It's too hard when you have morals that work against companies, employees who will take advantage of that, etc.\n\nThat said, I loved my team. They never were expected to get me anything but one year they bought me about two months worth of mountain dew because they knew I lived off it! I've mostly quit the stuff since...",

That was a big deal for our company, at the time.\n\nFound out a few days later from the Assistant Manager that the Store Manager bought those out of pocket. I felt terrible, and I still think about that sometimes twenty years later. \ud83d\ude2d",

It\u2019s nearly impossible to get your employees something meaningful that won\u2019t break your bank account. You can NEVER expense gifts, it\u2019s always out of pocket. \nI try and think of what brought me the most joy or use  throughout the year and then a write a letter as to why I chose that gift for them in hopes it would bring the same happiness to them and their families. One year I bought our 2 favorite family games for my employees but addressed the package to their families. In the packaged I thanked them for sharing their dad, mom, wife, husband, father etc with our team.  One year I asked some meaningful questions and found the charities everyone liked. I donated money to that charity and bought bracelets for each of them. Half the money went to that charity.  One year it was an Alexa and I wrote about how much my family used ours and for what. It\u2019s worth it when my employees use the gifts and tell me all the ways their families have spent time together enjoying them\u2026.  Even if it wasn\u2019t a lot of money spent.  With over 15 employees, this is challenging!! Feel free to reply with any good suggestions !",

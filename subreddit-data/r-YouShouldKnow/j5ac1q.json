The other day I had a really boring Physics lecture and I thought that maybe if I watched Cosmos: A space-time Odyssey, that would ignite a little spark to make my lectures more enjoyable. The thing is where I am from, I couldn't find it anywhere Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. Miracously, I stumbled to this site, which looked very suspicious in the beginning (I am very skeptical of watching free stuff online). However, the online viewing quality is great, the download speed is decent and the few docs I watched even come with subtitles. Moreover, as the docs are sorted by themes, I found more than 10 I was interested in and added them to a potential playlist. I am very happy with this site, which I know, sounds too good to be true. So far, I haven't had a single problem. Enjoy! \n\n[https://www.documentarymania.com/home.php](https://www.documentarymania.com/home.php)\n\nPS : I use brave browser which blocks adds. I don't really know if the normal website drops a bunch of adds everytime you click something . If so , that sucks , but I think its still a site worth sharing",

It's far easier to download a remote desktop some one else can control your PC and set up a screen mirror. \n\nIt works like watching someone record a 4k video and then watching it on your 720p stream. If you tried to stream it would only be 720p but if you screen mirror someone that has a 4k monitor you'll be able to have the full viewing experience. \n\nI know it's free but it's always good form to move the folder containing your bank info to your desktop. Rename the folder 'tip' so the person letting you screen mirror can pay for the electricity used. Don't worry if there is a \u00a3500 payment, that's usually just to initiate the link so the banks think it's a legit sale. They will 99% of the time refund your \u00a3497 only taking what you need. \n\nIf you send the link to all your family members over the age of 60 via email they can get their computers checked for viruses at the same time as watching the film :)",

    "postText": "Why YSK: bikes are not cars. It is easy to weave around pedestrians when you know what they're doing. But if they abruptly sprint across the road right before you're about to cycle past them, there's a pretty good chance of a crash.\n\nI cycle every day in a congested city and the only times I've ever been scared of hurting myself or others are when this has happened - someone's jaywalking, doesn't see me (who cares, no biggie) but then they hear me coming, look up, dart into my path, and I have to slam the breaks on. Don't do this! If they've seen you, keep doing what you were doing &amp; trust them to avoid you - or just use the pedestrian crossings!",

In congested places where 2 wheeled (and smaller) vehicles are the default, there is often a style of driving &amp; walking on roads that is more about making sure you don't hit anything ahead of you than worrying about who is going to hit you from behind or sides.",

Just like you said, if you just keeping doing what you\u2019re doing and go for it they will manage themselves to avoid you. It was scary for me to cross the roads at first but my friend who lived there showed me the ropes. Your advice is perfect ;)",

I cycle carefully but jaywalkers randomly sprinting unexpectedly is the only thing that has ever given me a fright.\n\nWhat I am saying, is that people often think they are moving to \"make sure they're safe\", when in actual fact it's confusing the cyclist and making it much more likey they will end up getting hit. If you've already dawdled into the middle of oncoming traffic, it's often too late to \"make sure\" - but eye contact with the cyclist and calm, predictable movements are a better bet than running into where they were planning to go to avoid you.",

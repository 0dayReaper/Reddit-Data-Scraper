    "postText": " If you are reluctant about starting, continuing, or ending your personal fitness journey because you are self-conscious about your size, form, or anything else that can riddle you with anxiety then know this; NOBODY else in the gym besides you cares about what YOU are doing. It doesn't matter if you're in there trying to lose weight, put on size, or just maintain a somewhat healthy lifestyle. Everyone in the gym is working towards a common goal; bettering themself.\n\nThere isn't a single person in the entire gym that knows EVERYTHING. There are so many different styles and techniques that it's nearly impossible. Don't expect someone to approach and help critique you because there is a fear of coming off as a know it all or a prick even though that's never the intention. But I guarantee if you ask someone who looks like they know what they are doing they would be MORE than happy to help. All you have to do is ask. Some of the nicest people I've met are the strongest guys/gals in the gym at any given time. \n\nI say this because I witnessed it happen at the gym today. Someone with not a lot of experience was in a workout room that eventually filled with 3/4 \"bigger\" guys. While it was just him and I in there he was just doing his thing. After they got there, he did maybe two more sets before putting his weight away and hastily grabbing his jacket to leave the gym. To anyone that knows how to read people, anxiety was written all over his face. I could be wrong, but I do believe it's why he left. \n\nDon't let other people intimidate you into not working towards your goals. Everyone starts somewhere, and nobody knows it all. Keep on trying your best, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.",

One day the strongest guy in the gym came up to me and said to keep working, that one day he was my size. After this Idgaf what others think. That little comment helped me a lot more than he thought.

You will feel little weird in the beginning, but it becomes easy with time. \n\nUse a TDEE calculator to estimate how many calories you need to stay the same weight. Count your calories and determine the actual amount. Adjust + or - 500 calories if you want to gain or lose weight accordingly. \n\nI would recommend getting under 15% body fat before bulking. You can look at pictures online to estimate your body fat percentage. \n\nGo on to r/fitness, r/gainit, or r/loseit and find a workout routine off the wiki. I recommend doing a simple 5x5 type workout routine like strong lifts or starting strength in the beginning to learn compound lifts.\n\nDo this for a month and then find a more intense routine, like the reddit PPL. Do this for a year with consistent diet, and you\u2019ll look pretty good. Just remember to stay consistent and recognize your progress won\u2019t be perfectly linear. Good luck.",

As soon as I step in a gym it's like an Instagram pose-off that I didn't sign up for. I just feel like the majority of people are there (often with their hair styled, carefully dressed, with full make-up, and spending a lot of time trying to flex or make others feel uncomfortable) to compete in some ghastly imaginary reality TV show. I've been to so many gyms over the years and never had a good experience. Now I just have my weights at home and stick to exercise that doesn't come with a huge dose of preening and judgement. I don't mind if other people want a space to do that stuff, but I don't want to be there and I haven't found a space that isn't that.\n\nEdit: I have to say now that I remembered, the one exception was prison. People were so damn supportive in prison gyms, helping each other train and organising support for newbies. I never once felt judged in a prison gym. Completely the opposite experience in all other gyms.",

            "comment": "Ill be honest: ive seen pretty much every kind of human in the gym. I remember someone who was extremly overweight, and somebody who was really skinny, like his whole arm were the size of his wrists. You notice them more than the average Joe, of course. Like you would notice them on the streets or the bus.\n\nBut right after that thought you think \"hey, at least he is with us in here trying to change that. Mad props for that\". Theyre trying to change that instead of sitting in the McDonalds (literally next door). Everyone in the gym has a goal, and the goals of these guys are much harder to achieve.\n\nNobody is gonna confront them, nobody is even gonna look for longer than a second on them (except theyre behaving like a douche, for example the deadlifter screaming so hard his voice cords get a better workout than his body).\n\nAdditionally, youre in there with everyone else sharing the same passion and hobby. Many different kind of people trained there, people i wouldnt look in the eye if i pass waiting on the streets. But since you all have the same interest in there, youre helping each other by spotting, by asking and answer questions, sometimes just a little small talk if there are less people in the gym this day.\n\nEdit: and for being intimidated: imagine going into the bank to get some cash. On the ATM next to you is somebody who is dressed more expensive and getting more money out of the ATM than you are. Are you intimidated by him? Probably not. You will forget the guy in 10 seconds and so is he gonna forget you, and thats it.",

There are going to be some people who will judge and look, but just like there would be anywhere else.\n\n\nMost will judge on your form and manners though. So maybe take this time during the pandemic to work on some home exercises and getting proper form right so you can develop a mind-muscle connection, and not feel encouraged to work with weights you can\u2019t handle which would make you look lost or even worse hurt yourself. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to lose weight, that\u2019s 90% on what you do in the kitchen. You can\u2019t outrun a bad diet, *especially* when starting out. So if you\u2019re apprehensive that\u2019s where your primary goal should lie.",

    "postText": "I have noticed that many of my male friends who are either gay or single don't have garbage bins in their half bathrooms. This can make it very awkward for a female on their period. Either they have to try and wrap up feminine hygiene products in toilet paper and carry it around your house searching for another garbage or awkwardly stash it in their purse. It's 20 times more awkward if this happens during a party when you have a lot of people around. I've also had this problem before when visiting older women who don't need a garbage can for their own personal use anymore so men aren't the only culprits. So please consider that your guests might actually need and appreciate a small garbage can in the toilet area.",

I've seen toilets clogged by having an excessive amount of toilet paper in them (probably done by /u/Mithridates12), but they don't overflow when clogged like they do in the US (if anything, they look more like US toilets when clogged since the water level comes close to the top). If these reddit threads are anything to go by, American toilets seem more likely to clog, and when they do, they overflow. Unless people here are exaggerating?",

Y'all, it takes up less room than the toilet brush and just sits there until it's full. I also have a little can next to my dryer where I throw the lint and it just sits there until it's full, too. It doesn't mean I'm creating excessive amounts of lint or drying my clothes too frequently, it's just a thing that's convenient and takes up almost zero resources to have.",

Our strongest auger wasn't getting through it when we snaked it. Rock solid wall of rice. Incredible. Moral of the story...be nice to your drains. They're meant for water. Not waste.

Anytime I was on my period I wasn't allowed to leave anything in the trashcan. Not even until the end of the day. I had to bring some bags, a can, and then throw them away once I got home. Pretty thankful for the dumpster at the apartment building. That was humiliating though.\n\nDuring a party they hosted a female waitress came up to me. She was told she wasn't allowed to leave tampons in the trashcan and didn't know what to do. Here I am dressed up and not wanting to get dirty, but it was still my job during the party, along with too many other duties. I told her go on to the bathroom and as soon as she got out I went in. I grabbed some quick cleaning stuff, changed the trash, and snuck the bag outside. Poor girl was so embarrassed to ask me, but I was glad I could help her.",

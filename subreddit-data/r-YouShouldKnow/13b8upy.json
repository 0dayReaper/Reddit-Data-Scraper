    "postText": "Why YSK: so that next time you're worried about strange symptoms in the middle of the night, you can have a better chance of figuring out whether you should go to the ER or not. \n\nYou will be asked questions that *adjust* depending on your answers, and follow up with more detailed questions if needed. By the end of questions part, you get up to five most likely reasons behind your symptoms, and level of care that is needed (paraphrasing, \"can be managed at home\", \"seek a doctor soon\", and \"go to an ER immediately\"). \n\nObviously the app isn't a medical professional, and it's not foolproof, but it has been immensely helpful to me on multiple occasions, and it definitely feels more cohesive and helpful than looking up random symptoms on the internet. To be clear, this isn't sponsored in any way, I just keep using it and it doesn't seem to be very well known.\n\nLink to the app: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ada.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ada.app)",

For instance, if a cat bites you hard enough to puncture skin (only applies to bites, not scratches - it's about their teeth structure), you should go to the hospital ASAP, because it's very likely to cause a serious infection within 24 hours.

Took the older one to the vet hospital because he had an infection (the other cat bit him.) When they gave him a shot, he freaked out and bit me. I ended up with an infection -- got me right on the knuckle, too. And I ended up taking as many antibiotics as the cat did.\n\nMy Vet Tech told me to go to urgent care, she got bit and ended up with an infection from another cat (patient.) So... It's a good idea to always be cautious with cat bites. They frequently turn into infections.",

This has led NZ to be worried about a brain drain from NZ to Australia. If that happens it will have a negative impact on NZ, BUT it could mean more opportunities will be available there.\n\nIn Australia I think it's safe to say that we think of New Zealand as kind of a little brother. I'm not sure NZ sees it this way though. \ud83d\ude02",

We see it all the time in the ER.

Again, it is not the same as a professional diagnosis, but in cases where you can't afford sick days unless absolutely necessary, or you don't have access to free healthcare, I find it to be a better tool than looking up separate symptoms online and trying to guess which out of 50 possible diseases you have. \n\nI'm a hypochondriac myself, and I know this isn't going to work this way for everyone, but for me this was actually helpful.

It wasn't may rank that was stagnating, I had no desire to get into management. They already pawned enough shit off on me that was pseduo-management as it was and I wanted less, not more. \n\nWhat was stagnating was my personal growth. My skill set had developed to the point where my job was rarely challenging, I was not getting anything in the way of new experiences, my skill set was no longer advancing, and even if I took some training/certifications to further those skill sets I'd have no opportunity to use them. I was at the point I was literally inventing projects for myself that just so happened to benefit the company, but I was really doing them for me to learn new things. I had a couple examples of those too. \n\nIf somebody interviewing you for a job asks why you're looking to a leave a job you've been at for a long time, if what I just said describes you, tell them that.",

I had a co-op job in high school and the guy I was sort of an apprentice to was a former radio guy. You put him on the phone with a customer and he just sounded so smooth and put together compared to a nervous, nerdy high school guy whose every 3rd word was um. \n\nAt that point I made the conscious decision to try and be like that. I wasn't sure how, but I wanted to sound like that when I talked to people. It inspires confidence and respect so long as you're not full of shit and actually know what you're talking about. \n\nIt just takes practice from there. Listen to other people's conversations. Think of how they could have said something better, or more confidently. Play back previous conversations in your head after you talk to people and think of how it could have been better. Eventually, you get better at doing it in real time. \n\nEasy way to practice? Stand in a room, by yourself, where nobody else can hear you and tell an imaginary person about something you know a lot about. Don't prepare, shoot from the hip, see how it goes and give yourself about 5 minutes. Then do it again a couple times over the next few days. Eventually you just might be impressed with yourself, and it does wonders for your confidence. When you're more confident, you get less rattled and you're even better. \n\nWritten is no different. Tell me, somebody else, hell tell Microsoft fucking Word a whole bunch about something, what you think, how you feel, anything. Then delete that shit and do it again. Then do it again. Read some stuff professional people wrote, then write about it too and see if you can sound as good as they do. \n\nArgh I tend to get rambly when I'm tired, but hey, you know what if that was even a tiny bit useful to you, awesome. Go out and kick ass my friend, I wish you the best.",

In her eyes if only she knew how to do stuff then she wasn't indispensable. Turns out she was, got fired, and then none of us had any idea how to input inventory or make orders for more merchandise. Not a good plan. At another job (a deli) same thing, the supervisor was the only one allowed to make certain things. So when she was out we had no lasagna or desserts, and we had no way of ordering more bread and soups. On the other hand, in the military they train you not only for your role, but the role of your superiors, should one of them die or not be available. That's how organizations should work.",

Because of scoring good marks then, I have been saddled with some huge expectations by my family and society. I have to have a tremendous career and everything. Add to that, every one else my age in my extended family have become big-achievers. I'm the only one left to show my worth. Funny thing is, in school, I was the best among all of us. So, now, it's like I'm the only loser left to achieve anything good. In fact, because I was the best then, I had to go after the most ambitious career. But, I failed spectacularly in that.\n\n\nNow, I'm after something that's far more difficult to achieve than the ones I have failed at in the past. As a result, it requires extreme hardwork. I have been able to put some considerable shift in it and I'm probably at the halfway stage right now. But, I'm fast losing confidence in my ability to sustain this level of hardwork. I don't think I can maintain this level of commitment and dedication for another couple of years. \n\n\nIf I give up now, I would feel like I did it because of my inability. That would haunt me for life. Yet, I don't see the point of pursuing something this extraordinary in life. I would be perfectly content with a simple teaching job at my local school. I guess, it's more like I'm doing everything to prove a point to others, and that's definitely not a good thing. Yet, I'm bound to, as failing that would probably make me hate my life forever. The society I belong to has such unforgiving dynamics. I feel like, my fate has been sealed and I simply do not have a choice in it. \n\n\nSorry for the rant.",

And I completely understand the feeling of responsibility towards one's parents. There are two things that usually help me deal with it - \n\n1. Whatever you're attempting isn't the be all or end all of life. Remember the difference between what you need and want. A simple teaching job is all you need, its just that right now, you're reaching beyond that to see what else can be done. But your basic desire is always accessible.\n\n2. Fundamentally, good parents just want long-term happiness for their kids. But the problem is that they have an image of a high-paying/prestigious career in mind as the definition of a good life. If they criticize your choice of a simple job, its just because of their preconceived notions of what happiness should look like. If you know that that teaching job will keep you content, it will reflect in your interactions with your parents. And hopefully, over time, they will get it.",

Do what your environment wants you to do and be unhappy about that, because you are not able to step up against that pressure.\n2. Do what you want against the pressure of your environment and be happy about that.\n\nThe second one is way harder to achieve than the first, because it does not involve external praise.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight, I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight, I wouldn't lose to anyone.\n\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know who it was.",

He never kills unnecessarily, and never risks his own life for frivolous reasons. Living is harder than dying. The Radiant's duty is to live.\n\nStrength before weakness - All men are weak at some time in their lives. The Radiant protects those who are weak, and uses his strength for others. Strength does not make one capable of rule; it makes one capable of service.\n\nJourney before destination - There are always several ways to achieve a goal. Failure is preferable to winning through unjust means. Protecting ten innocents is not worth killing one. In the end, all men die.

There\u2019s no grand plan or goal. I\u2019ve learned to be content wherever I am, and the grand purpose to my life is simply to live it every day as best I can.

But if you don't do anything to make society a bit better, even by small deeds, you are living comfortably on the backs of all those before you that spilled blood, sweat and tears for your comfort and stability.

But I feel compelled to pursue some greater principle that could pull the world in toward the sense of beauty and meaning I'm trying to cultivate for myself. It's hard not to want that, especially when you look outside and see how much of a fucking mess the world is. People are suffering everywhere, every day. People are lonely, lost, and losing hope with no idea what to do with themselves or their lives. I wish I could help them. I want to study to be a counsellor but the thought of that effort, commitment and responsibility scares the shit out of me. I could just learn some stupid trade (no offense) and spend the rest of my life working for someone else for reasons I don't care about, or I could get up and take the risk of paying for school to at least get started. But it's SO hard to get started. But like, talk about first world problems. People elsewhere are starving, unsheltered and afraid. Hell, people here are. Life is heavy sometimes.",

And all these people came to learn that they felt more fulfilled when they lived \"for others\" so to speak. And not in \"I'm going to change the world\" sort of fashion, more like, they just used some of their time doing things to help ease the suffering of their friends and family, and they felt better about themselves for doing it.",

Over time I've realized to stop turning outward. Try to be at peace and compete with yourself. That's the true test. To master one's self. Thanks again for this gentle, loving reminder. We are not all Ghandi, etc and that's ok. It's ok to just be me. And try to try to be the best me I can be. Have a great day, friends.\n\nEdit: Gandhi \u263a\ufe0f",

    "postText": "Why YSK. Ikea will typically give you small spare parts if you lose or break anything. Find the item you bought online. Navigate to the assembly instructions, and find the part number(s) for the parts that broke or got lost. You can either go to the physical store or order them online. It's usually free!",

If a friend, family member, or loved one who has been isolated is spending time with you, it is because they care about you. Pointing out their \u201cstrange\u201d (non-harmful) behavior will likely make them feel worse about something they\u2019re aware of but struggling to control.",

Social VR is good space to practice socializing where there are almost zero consequences if you mess up. It can be pretty intimidating to talk to people at first, but once you start finding nice people they will introduce you to their other nice friends and then it starts cascading from there. \n\nThere is actually a decently large amount of people in VRchat who never/rarely speak. Sometimes they carry around pens to write, but you would be surprised by how much can be said through physical expressions alone. It's generally accepted by the community and these people will still have tons of both 'mute' and 'talker' friends alike.\n\nAlmost every night there are parties which generate an atmosphere surprisingly close to an IRL party. People are drinking, dancing, talking, playing beer pong, etc. There are also chill worlds where you can just hangout and chat with people if that is more your speed. My favourite thing to do is to go to the \"open mic night\" worlds and listen to live music with a bunch of other people. There are a lot of talented musicians from all over the world who play live music for free in VRchat!\n\nIt being online does attract a lot of creeps/degenerates, but it's fairly easy to just block them and move on.",

You have to remember that your personal boundaries and comfort zones all shrink when you don't get a chance to keep up with being social. Pushing them back out again happens with practice and you need to remind yourself that your friends want to see you do well (and if they don't, it's not anxiety that's the problem). Give yourself opportunities that are likely to go well, because you want some wins where you can take them to build up confidence. Unsuccessful interactions can make things harder, but rationalizing them out and giving yourself a break on dumb mistakes can help prevent bad interactions from being anxiety-inducing reminders going forward. \n\nIf you find yourself overwhelmed and panicking in public, try and find a spot to be alone (I look for bathrooms in unfamiliar places) and focus on your breathing. Slow inhaling through the nose and out through the mouth are key and breathing exercises alone can stop panic attacks at the onset. Drinking or splashing water on your face can help, too, as can eating. Worst case scenario is you ride out the panic knowing that you're body's fight or flight response can only happen for so long (I think the max is around 15 minutes? It's a lot of time while you're panicking).",

At the beginning it was partly COVID related (work in the medical field -with the providers but not with patients) and partly the not seeing anyone.  Then it was my birthday and the next day was Easter I got a call from my parents and a text from two of my friends, oh and my nephew texted me at the end of the day.\nIt\u2019s been sort of nice because I don\u2019t need to make excuses to not show up to misc gatherings, but it\u2019s also a bit miserable to not see people in person.  So I have highs and lows, well maybe not highs, more like middle of the road and lows.  And with winter coming up I\u2019m not exactly looking forward to all the gray days coming up.\n\nOn the bright side, before all of this one of my cats wouldn\u2019t leave the bedroom unless it was to eat, heck she wouldn\u2019t leave the bed.  If her brother started getting too near her she would start to growl and I needed to try to distract him so we wouldn\u2019t have a full out fight (it had been nasty for a while - since we got back from her first vet appointment after she went blind in one eye).  Since I\u2019ve been home every day she kept making progress on getting out and exploring, and I would say that as of last week we\u2019re about 95% back to how she had been.",

In March/April however, when Covid was at its (then) peak here in germany, I basically holed myself in and had as little contact as possible.\n\nTo preface this: I'm a pretty shy introverted guy as is. But holy fuuuuuuuuck did my mental health take a hit then. There's a massive difference between being alone and being lonely. And I was lonely. I was so. fucking. lonely. I was spending every minute of my being thinking about stuff... something, anything. Watched countless hours of Netflix or YouTube, scrolled endlessly through reddit until I reached the parts I had seen the day before, stared at the wall, paced the appartment...and it really, really REALLY sucked. Nothing I did, neither phoning friends (which I did way too seldom back then, I now realize), helped with that feeling of actually seeing someone, having someone there in your presence.\nI was so glad when my boss called and told me that I was able to start my job. I really wanted to go hug everyone of my new department... but I think my introversion got the better of me then. \nHowever, never will I forget how much better it is to just sit there in silence with your colleague rather than being home alone. I'm just grateful for that and I sincerely hope that everyone who goes through that same stuff comes out in one piece :)",

They kept pointing out the socially distanced seating while ignoring the fact that I'd be sitting with them. We don't live together,  if one of them catches COVID, I could catch it from them and vice versa. My sister only has one lung FFS but they act like the only people at risk are the elderly.

Probably the hardest part about all this is the fact that nearly everyone else I know is basically carrying on like normal. 4th of July, all my friends got together while I sat at home alone.

If it felt like a group effort, like we are all having to go through it, I think I'd feel way better about it. \n\nI broke up with my girlfriend in April, partly because she kept pressuring me to visit. I blocked one of my oldest friends for hugging me and touching my face as a \"joke\" when I actually did go visit them on Halloween.  This shit is actively messing up my social life and makes me feel like I'm overreacting because in any other context these things would make me sound like a crazy person! \n\nI just want us to all still be around after the pandemic.

It is also known as unrealistic optimism or comparative optimism. Optimism bias is common and transcends gender, ethnicity, nationality and age. Optimistic biases are even reported in non-human animals such as rats and birds.Four factors can cause a person to be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their cognitive mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood.\n\n[About Me](https://www.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://www.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply '!delete' to delete",

    "postText": "This happens all the time where people misuse these two expressions. \n\nWhen you want to provide examples, e.g. is appropriate. So it\u2019s correct to say \u201cThere were many fruits (e.g. lemons and apples),\u201d but not to say \u201c(i.e. lemons and apples).\u201d i.e. is correctly used only when the thing after the i.e. is exactly what you\u2019re referring to. So \u201che ate his two favorite fruits (i.e. lemons and apples),\u201d is correct. And \u201c(e.g. lemons and apples)\u201d would not be correct. Lemons and apples aren\u2019t *examples* of his two favorite fruits, they *are* his two favorite fruits. \n\nI know this sounds pedantic but it can lead to a ton of confusion since the two expressions mean fairly different things.",

The fact that they are both valid English expressions doesn't mean they have the same meaning.\n\n'Anymore' and 'any more' is one example.  'Anymore' is an adverb that means 'any longer'.  'Any more' is a determiner that indicates quantity.  Saying 'I'm not allowed to buy anymore video games' is incorrect, because there it's being used as an expression of quantity and should be 'any more'.  However, you could say 'I'm not allowed to buy video games anymore', since there it's being used as an adverb meaning 'any longer'.  Use 'anymore' only where 'any longer' would also make sense.\n\n'Everyday' and 'every day' is another one.  The former is an adjective meaning 'happening every day' and the latter is effectively an adverb meaning 'each day'.  So 'I go to the store everyday' is incorrect; it should be 'every day', since it is modifying the verb 'go'.  But you would say 'Going to the store is an everyday occurrence' since there it's modifying the noun 'occurrence'.  Use 'every day' only where 'each day' would also make sense.\n\nThe one- and two-word versions are *not* interchangeable, folks.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Using vector formats will make your large event poster or advertisement look pleasing and professional instead of pixelated.\n\nPicture formats like jpg and png are \u201craster\u201d formats, where the image is stored as an array of pixels. If you scale these up, they look pixelated (blocky) and unprofessional. Formats like svg and eps are \u201cvector\u201c formats, where the image is stored as shapes and lines. These can be scaled up cleanly. \n\nYou can use free software such as Inkscape or Vectornator to convert raster images to vector images, before sending them to your poster printing service, so that they will still look clean and professional when scaled up to poster size.\n\nEDIT: I should have clarified this to begin with: Vector formats work best for simple clip-art style graphics or company logos. For photos, it\u2019s better to use a high-resolution jpeg (either taken with a decent camera, or upscaled with software).",

Of course, you can achieve it pretty easily with free software like inkscape, but it will never look as good as with human help.",

If you want a picture of a circle, that's something that is a vector per nature, so you can easily get a vector image of a circle that can be scaled infinitely.\n\nBut if you take a picture of a bird, that's just a representation, as a bunch of tiny pixels, of what the bird looks like. There's so many pixels there that your eyes see a bird, but it actually is just a bunch of colored squares. If you scale it up enough, you'll notice the squares. If you wanted to actually have a vector representation of a bird, some artist would need to \"draw\" this bird, using conventional shapes (circles, squares, curves...). Then you could also scale it up as much as you wanted, but drawing such a bird is no easy task, and most of the time is a pointless task, when you can just take another picture with greater resolution (more, smaller pixels). \n\nSo, in the end, vector formats are useful for \"man made\" drawings that can easily be represented as a composition of basic shapes, like a logo or a cartoon. But any realistic photograph won't fit in this description, so converting it to a vector format will be hard, if not impossible.",

The file sizes aren't necessarily smaller, although they can be if the algorithm for making the vector is very advanced. There are some advantages and trade-offs, but generally photographs will look a lot better as raster images. A vector photograph will not look pixelated when enlarged, but instead will look very flat. Think of the famous Obama \"Hope\" image by Shepherd Fairy. That's an extreme example that is using the flatness of a vector image as part of the intended effect.\n\n[Here is an example of a high quality svg photograph.](https://freesvg.org/bright-blue-grapes)\n\nEdit - Weird down votes but I guess I'm sorry for providing factual information and multiple examples and sources.",

Vector graphics are a different tool for a different use, not a better tool.\n\nVector graphics are probably great for flash games and mobile games today, because they let you draw a lot of shapes really efficiently. They're very precise with a very small file size. But raster graphics are great if you want to add textures. Modern games do a lot of both, using vectors to define where the walls and shapes go, then mapping the raster textures onto them. \n\nYou can think of an audio example as well. You could teach a computer what each note sounds like, then give it sheet music and tell it to play it. Or you could have a musician play the music, and put the audio file into the computer game. The former is a lot more precise and uses way less space, but the latter has a lot more texture.\n\nAlso, we really only convert real life into raster data, not vectors. When you take a photo, your camera is recording each pixel and saving information about it. That's raster data. Your camera can't look at an image and trace outlines it sees in the scene to record it as geometry. Same idea for audio, but your microphone sensor works on all the wavelengths. When you listen to a song, you might recognize the words and notes, but the microphone just samples every wavelength and can't tell what any of it *means*.\n\nOP talked about converting from raster to vector. You can do that. But the thing is that only certain types of images make sense as vector data. Your company's logo and wordmarks are excellent candidates to be vector graphics, so you should definitely be asking your artist for the vector files and be using those. Basically anything that you could trace as geometry and have it be coherent would be good as a vector (although converting it can be difficult or sloppy). Something like a photo of you and dog would be entirely transformed if you converted it to a vector. It might look good, or it might be hot garbage. But at that point you're basically just using your pose in the photo as a model for you to trace, so it's going to turn into a cartoon. If you want that, great. But it's not going to look \"better\" if you convert it. It'll look different.",

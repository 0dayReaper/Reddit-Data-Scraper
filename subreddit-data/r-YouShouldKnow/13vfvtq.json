And they may not be aware of this. \n\nThis is not to excuse or minimize extremely problematic opinions or behavior, only to spread awareness. \n\nThe cognitive symptoms of lead poisoning are:\n\n&gt;Cognitive impairment: Lead poisoning can result in intellectual deficits, including decreased IQ, learning difficulties, and impaired attention and concentration.  \n\n&gt;Behavioral changes: Lead toxicity can cause behavioral problems, such as irritability, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and aggressiveness, particularly in children. \n\n&gt;Peripheral neuropathy: Prolonged exposure to lead may lead to nerve damage, resulting in tingling or numbness in the extremities, weakness, and coordination difficulties. \n\n&gt;Seizures: In severe cases of lead poisoning, seizures can occur, which are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that can cause convulsions or loss of consciousness. \n\n&gt;Encephalopathy: Chronic lead exposure may cause encephalopathy, which is a broad term referring to brain dysfunction. Symptoms can include confusion, memory loss, disorientation, and even coma in severe cases.",

Areas next to old walls or by the sides of roads can be particularly affected.\n\nDust: Paint chips or contaminated soil can form dust particles.\n\nToys: Old toys might have been colored with lead-based paint. Although this is illegal in the US, toys from other countries may still use lead-based paints.\n\nTraditional cosmetics: Kohl, used as an eyeliner, has been found to contain high levels of lead.\n\nStained glass: Making stained glass involves using lead solder.\n\nPottery: Some ceramic glazes contain lead.\n\nTobacco smoking: Active and passive smoking have been linked to higher lead levels in the blood.",

It was a Semitic Language word meaning something like purifying or extracting as they were extracting the black powder from the petroleum resources.\n\nLater, the Arabs were the first to distill the ethanol from wine and beer etc to create the first hard liquors, and used the same word Al-Kohl for the extraction product. This gives us the modern word Alcohol which is directly related to the ancient eye makeup because of the sort of similar process used to make it.",

The people making the additive were getting sick and the company spun it as mania caused by being soooo happy to work there. New emissions standards in the 70\u2019s caused the invention of catalytic converters and the use of unleaded fuel. Leaded gasoline would indeed ruin the substrate in them, but converters were not the reason for phasing it out.",

While it is safe to use them if they are intact and undamaged if damage occurs and goes unnoticed then it could lead unknowingly to lead poisoning after prolonged use. Personally I don\u2019t risk it with vintage items I haven\u2019t tested for heavy metals and radiation since it\u2019s extremely hard to know what was used. I have these very nice art deco glass mugs for cocktails and tested them only to find out that they got their cool coloration from a shit load of mercury and cadmium. I still have them because they are absolutely beautiful, but I would never use them daily.\n\n\n[Antique glass particularly can have some pretty nasty additives that produce beautiful colors.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0016/6959/5189/files/chemistry-of-colored-glass-w_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616859591)\n\n[This particular Red-Orange ceramic color is also quite dangerous and can send a Geiger counter crazy if it\u2019s from pre-1942 or from 1954-1984.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1031/6089/products/destination-yarn-preorder-uranium-orange-29261236961374_2048x.jpg?v=1663432780) Some of those enamels were a double whammy too since they contained a lot of depleted uranium and a lot of lead for a good shine. They\u2019re also still floating around at university ceramics departments or on the internet for hobbyists from sellers ignorant of what they contain.

While I don't want to discredit the story of her life, it's strange that there's no clear scientific evidence that such a wide-spread product as Pyrex - a product so widespread it is an eponym for glass food storage - contains potentially lethal amounts of lead. In the 70s if you got married and had a wedding registry, Pyrex was on it.\n\nI also think there's an attribution issue here, where Boomers are aging into cognitive decline, and these products are being blamed for that. It's more correlation than causation.",

But at least people who have come of drinking age in the last decade or two don\u2019t have the excuse of bad science telling them that alcohol can be beneficial to them if consumed in moderation. Science is pretty clear now that NO amount of alcohol is healthy for you. Older generations were misled however, but of course good luck now getting them to change their ways. \n\nWidespread, alcohol-induced brain damage is probably a real thing, but we\u2019ll probably never know the full extent of it.",

That instrument is currently the gold standard on lead testing\n\nIt goes 1/8th of an inch thick on whatever surface it's on and take a cumulative reading of all layers of material on it. That may not sound like much, but that is a ton of possible paint, stain, glaze layers or whatever material is in it\n\nIt absolutely will make a positive read if lead is in the glaze. The \"leaching\" that the comment says cannot be measured. Even the 3M test will still come up positive if the glaze isn't deteriorating. It will still react with the lead.\n\nBasically if the XRF comes up with a hit on a plate or toy, you should not use it for consumption, or that a baby can put in their mouth. Period.",

Kids get affected the most so growing up with leaded gas means you are more violent, less intelligent, and don\u2019t have as much impulse control. Many European countries banned leaded gas in a similar time starting with Germany in 1971. Most every country that banned lead saw a similar drop in crime. They all had largely different societies, economic situations, and many other factors. The constant through all those independent crime drops was a generation of kids that didn\u2019t grow up with leaded gasoline. \n\nAlso, the people that made leaded gasoline knew of the societal damages it would do, far before the regulators caught up. It\u2019s probably the biggest health disaster in human history.",

The Corelle manufacturing process has always encapsulated decoration in glass, using extremely high processing temperatures to ensure the glass decorations are sealed, which prevents food contact and intentionally decreases the extent of any lead migration to food.\n\n&gt;The testing confirms that the vintage products tested comply with current FDA lead-safety regulations \u2013 so feel free to use them for everyday dinnerware.",

A few pictures of over the counter lead tests and the singular xrf report are compelling but not wholly conclusive. Corelle suggests retiring styles older than 2005 but there's no acknowledgement of issues with their vintage patterns. Especially since they're extremely popular in the second hand market for being cute, lightweight, and indestructible. \n\nCaveat: my opinion is based on info from December 2022 when I stumbled upon the issue and subject to change.\n\nEdit: other redditors pointed out apparently Corelle has not made any official statement and the 2005 thing was posted by the aforementioned individual in private communication and is therefore not credible.",

Lead glazes are unsafe for the maker more than the consumer. This may change if the glaze or the plate is cracked, where the lead could then leach from the cracks on contact with acid foods.\n\nI'm gonna hazard a good guess and say that anything made by Corel (I.e. industry) was fired to temp and was well-formulated. Yes, these glazes contain lead. No, they ain't gonna hurt anyone. Handmade pots from Mexico, on the other hand, are much more likely to be low-fired with a lead glaze, and be a risk for leaching.",

The pictures have no information about how the lead levels were measured, but the last I saw something from Lead Safe Mama, she used X-ray fluorescence (XRF).\n\nXRF is an easy way to get a general idea of the chemical composition of something without any special preparation. But you have to know what you are doing and the limitations of the technology. Most XRF devices do not detect lighter elements like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and silicon among others. The XRF device will simply ignore any elements it can\u2019t detect. The percentages it reports for the elements it can detect are based on the assumption that those are the only elements present.\n\nThat can result in massive errors with organic materials, which are primarily carbon, and any type of oxide. The lead in lead paint is in the form of compounds that are at least half oxygen by atomic percent. So right there, the lead levels should probably be cut in half to account for the undetected oxygen.\n\nWhether or not those levels are dangerous is a different question, but we should at least start with reasonably good numbers.",

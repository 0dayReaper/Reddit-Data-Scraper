            "comment": "YSK: Logical fallacies are not a proper response in a debate, but a guideline for how to properly respond. Most people learn the fallacies and figure that\u2019s enough, not realizing that most people *simply don\u2019t care*. The link does a good job explaining why that is a logical fallacy, but not how to address it. \n\nFor example, the fallacy discussed here, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then leave,\u201d is a fallacy because it doesn\u2019t address the problem, as the link says. So knowing this does two things: it highlights to you that the person is attempting to move the conversation off topic, and it shows you the way to respond. \n\nOne response could be something like, \u201cWhy are you opposed to making things better?\u201d Or \u201cDo you really think we would be better off if we told people to leave?\u201d It forces them to examine their position and respond accordingly. But using the word logical fallacy when taking with an average person isn\u2019t going to get you far.",

The host was already not in the greatest mood (he being a last minute (literally) addiction, was one of the reasons), and was really not very happy with his attitude when we got to the table.

Its still not great, but its definitely improved a lot and will only be improving even more in the coming years, while the current city I live in isn't really doing much transit and bikability/urbanism-wise.  As a cyclist and non-car commuter, I was dismayed at the downgrade in transit and bikability I encountered, and one day decided to complain about it online.  I got countless replies of \"If you don't like our (terrible, non-existent unsafe) infrastructure, leave!  F off with that shit about your hometown, go back to where you came from!\"\n\nIn this case, what are you supposed to do?  Build actual protected bike lanes and more transit and higher frequency lines.  But the response was \"Noooo!  That's less space for my car!  I don't wanna give up a car lane for safer cyclist infrastructure or bus lanes!\"\n\nIn situations like this, where safe competent infrastructure is literally a matter of life or death for me, there's no room for \"respecting the locals\", you have to stand up for yourself and your safety.  This is one of those situations where I call bullshit.",

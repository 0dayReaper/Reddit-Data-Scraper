    "postText": "Long story short, my dog got ahold of a cooked bone. A big ol\u2019 ham bone. She obliterated it. After some Googling, I found that you should immediately give them bread. \n\nI shoved bread down her gullet until she looked like she was pregnant. My vet commended the move and said with how much bone she ate and how much had splintered, the bread saved her life. And if not her life, it saved me from having to pay $3k+ for surgeries. A $3 loaf of bread saved my dog\u2019s life. Crazy to think about. \n\nWhy YSK: From my understanding, the bread \u201cabsorbs\u201d the bone and keeps it from puncturing anything by essentially padding it. They may still need surgery to remove any big or sharp pieces, but it\u2019s better than needing additional surgery for a puncture. \n\n**You of course should still bring your dog to the vet asap**, but all she ended up needing was some x-rays and pain meds. A shitty situation ended better than it could have.\n\nEdit: **THIS ONLY APPLIES TO _COOKED_ BONES**\n\nEdit 2: Also bird bones are never good.",

            "comment": "My Dad (vet) said feeding a dog cooked bones is like feeding them needles. Raw bones are ok.\n\nEdit: My dad was an old school veterinarian from the highlands of Scotland. Also hes no longer with us so i cant get more details. I have a vivid memory of him telling me the danger of cooked bones so i repeated it here. Also someone said never chicken bones cooked or raw and i remember that too. I think the real treat for a dog is the blood soaked marrow in a raw bone.\n\nEdit: he identified with James Harroit. He told me a story of a highland vet, just getting ready for bed when the phone rings. Its a local farmer. The farmer says \"sorry to bother you doctor but the dogs swallowed a condom\". The doctor thinks this is a working dog, the condom might get stuck in the gut so he agrees to come out. So he gets out of bed, gets dressed and just as hes heading out the door the phone rings again. Its the farmer. He says \"its ok doctor, you dont have to come out, the wife's found another\"\n\nI lost count of the times he told me that one.",

There\u2019s the hard exterior bone which we see and think \u201cah yes, bone\u201d and there\u2019s the spongy bone inside of it. There\u2019s a lot of different reasons there\u2019s spongy bone on the inside; it weighs less, allows for red blood cell production, etc. Even deeper than that is the marrow, which makes up the long bits of bones and is also softer. Which is to say, when you cook the bone, these bits break down due to being less compact and softer. They aren\u2019t as tough as the exterior bone, but the lattice structure they provide inside the bone IS what allows for the outer bone to be SO STRONG. By cooking the bone, you\u2019re easily softening that inner structure, allowing the outer structure to become far more brittle. \nThis is kind of the same reason old people injure themselves more often in terms of falls. The inner structure of the bone degrades over time and you\u2019re left with far more brittle bones because of it. So, your dog probably shouldn\u2019t eat grandma either.",

Those bone shards can scratch, puncture, and cause impactions. \n\nRaw bones are generally more digestible and are less prone to puncturing the dogs intestines. They still aren't 100% safe and carry their own risks (namely blockages if the dog swallows too large a piece), but that is far more rare than what you see with cooked or smokes bones.",

Then the tweezers came out and someone had a flashlight and was trying to grab it, but only caught the skin and caused more pain. \n\nThen when everyone had had their turn, saying \"it will go away in a bit\" my brother came and gave me a piece of bread and it helped me.",

                            "comment": "Alright, I\u2019m a vet. I\u2019ll bite.  Preface: you sound like a person who wants to do right by their dog, I like clients like that. I don\u2019t have any skin in the game and I\u2019m not judging, I\u2019m just gonna lay it out though, no offense or disrespect intended. \n\nI\u2019ve personally been involved in several small intestinal perforation repairs from cooked bones. \n\nI\u2019ve personally been involved in numerous foreign body removals for raw bones that were small enough to be swallowed but too large to exit the small intestine. \n\nDoes it happen to every dog that eats a bone? No. Does it happen to most of them? No. \nWould I feed my dog bones? No. Because in 1 year I always see at least a few foreign bodies that are bones. I usually see AT LEAST 1 dog with bloody diarrhea from bone splinters. \n\nI don\u2019t frequently see perforated bowels from bone splinters, but I also don\u2019t work ER, and when I did, I saw a few over 5 years. Why would I knowingly take that risk when I know my dog doesn\u2019t actually care if it\u2019s a bone or something safer? \n\nI like to compare it to driving without a seatbelt.  Chances of getting in a wreck are less than getting somewhere safely, by quite a lot, but it\u2019s not that uncommon for car wrecks to happen, especially with the amount of people we have driving, and when you do you\u2019ll wish you were wearing the belt. \n\nSome other things in this comment thread that deserve attention: please don\u2019t feed raw diets without a nutritionist involved. People in this comment thread are arguing dogs have evolved to eat cooked bones because they\u2019ve evolved with us cooking; see the flawed logic? \nMany cases of bacterial gastroenteritis have been linked to both big name raw diets, and improperly prepared home made raw diets. The odds of a person getting food poisoning from safely prepared raw meat are low, but still much higher than cooked food. It\u2019s the same for dogs. I won\u2019t tell people not to do it at all, but please involve a veterinary nutritionist in formulating and sourcing your ingredients. That\u2019s what they are there for. \n\nAnd lastly, I don\u2019t get paid in any way shape or form for recommending any diets. The discount I get on dog food is the same career-wide, for all veterinary professionals, whether we sell/recommend the brand or not. The reason I recommend certain brands is because I know what goes on at their facilities, I know the research efforts they undertake, and I have spent a lot of time trying to wade my way through all the marketing lies to find the companies that I truly believe in.\n\nEdit: I do sometimes give my dog giant raw bones, such as legs of beef, knowing they\u2019re impossible to swallow. I find this fine. I just am always sure to throw it away once they start gnawing on the bone instead of enjoying the marrow and cartilage, etc. \nI don\u2019t let them chew the bone, because I see a LOT of fractured teeth from bones. Like a lot more than foreign bodies and perforated bowels. I\u2019d venture to call it common. \n\nAlso corrected some spelling.",

In contrast, \u201cA wolf\u2019s GI system can process raw meats, go longer without meals, and absorb nutrients in a different manner than that of a domestic dog.\u00a0 This is an important item to remember when choosing a food type for your pet dog, as their ability to stave off common pathogens in raw foods is very limited,\u201d says Fiendish.\n\nMossotti says wolves will sometimes eat plant materials, but that they\u2019re true carnivores. They also eat more than dogs do. \u201cWolves know that it\u2019s probably going to be a long time between meals or it will get stolen, so they can eat a ton at once. They can actually hold between 10 and 20 pounds, depending on the species. With domestic dogs, we give them [for example] a cup of food in the morning and a cup in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nA domestic dog being fed wolf kibble would probably get sick and have diarrhea because of the high level of protein, says Daniels. Conversely, \u201cIf I fed a domestic dog food to a wolf, that wolf would have deficiencies.\u201d \u00a0",

(We had a turtle figurine made of wax and they stuck this pin in to make the eye). The pediatrician told my mom to feed him spinach and it would wrap around the pin and he would pass it in his poo. \n\nAfter searching through a few poop diapers my mom found the whole pin wrapped in spinach! \n\nI'm glad your dog is okay!! :) And my little bromie.",

            "comment": "Great tip. As someone whose dog LIVES to knock over the trash can and eat scraps (yes we have a locked trash can, no it doesn\u2019t stop him), I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s a hierarchy of danger when it comes to cooked bones:\n\nMost chicken and fish bones are typically digested by your pup\u2019s stomach acid \u2014 it\u2019s the beef and pork bones that are most worrisome when it comes to splintering. \n\nI\u2019m not a vet, though, so please take your dog to be checked out!",

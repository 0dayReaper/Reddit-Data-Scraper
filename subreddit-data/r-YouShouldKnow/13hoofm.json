    "postText": "Why YSK: There is sometimes a misconception that a person must accept things left to them in a will. You can refuse (disclaim) an inheritance, there is a process by which to do this.\n\nSometimes people are left items in a will that are a costly burden rather than a gift, such as a \u201cvacation time share\u201d with high fees that\u2019s impossible to sell, or an old home with costly structural problems. Others may not want an inheritance for personal or ethical reasons.\n\nAlways get a consultation with an attorney for advice. Laws vary by location.",

It could be the case that disclaimed/renoun Ed gifts end up in the residue.\n\nAh, here's what HMRC (UK tax authority) says (https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm35161)\n\n\"In general law, a beneficiary has the right to\n\n- renounce a gift made to them under a will,\n- disclaim their interest under an intestacy.\n\nA beneficiary may disclaim by written disclaimer or by conduct. The disclaimer must apply to the whole of the benefit.  The beneficiary must not have received any benefit from the property being disclaimed, although they may accept one gift in a will and disclaim another.\n\nA disclaimer must be unconditional and the beneficiary cannot redirect the interest that is being disclaimed.  The disclaimed benefit falls back into residue and follows the devolution of the estate accordingly.\n\nA beneficiary who has disclaimed an interest under a will may subsequently retract their disclaimer provided no-one has altered their position in reliance on the disclaimer.\"\n\nBut this is of course not legal or financial advice!",

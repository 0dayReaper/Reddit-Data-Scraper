    "postText": "Why YSK: Because by all rights no single musician should have a monopoly on a melody for longer than the lifetime of anyone who is alive at the time it is written. In fact, by current copyright law, it could be argued that if this post (and by extention [this video](https://youtu.be/sfXn_ecH5Rw)) reaches (roughly) 3M views, then most music as we know could be argued to be no longer copyrightable.\n\nAs a musician myself, and as someone who is familiar with the music scene in general, I recognize that our current copyright system is something that tends to be feared rather than something which helps us to feel protected. Adam Neely, one of the authors of this video, and who has a significant presence on YouTube, expresses this thought in this video.\n\nOur copyright system has become untenable and should be overhauled, possibly from the ground up.",

Writing an algorithm to enumerate every possible melody, or every possible image, is trivial. The work in composing a melody or painting is in finding the interesting sequences in the unfathomably vast space of all possible sequences of notes or pixels.",

I have a PTSD SD, professionally trained with the help of a veterans SD group and was stopped going through security when attending an airshow.  I was asked for papers showing he was a service dog and I explained there was no such thing and got pulled aside.  Then a butterbar LT who was running the checkpoint came and asked the same thing, I again explained, and he said \"well the last person who came through had papers showing the dog was certified.\"  Told LT that was a scam, and again explained ADA (which technically doesn't apply to military bases, but the airshow did specifically allow SDs).  After some back and forth and the offer to compare DD214s and VA disability ratings I was allowed in, but it was some stress I didn't need.  All because some jackass went online to buy fake credentials for their dog.",

He more responds to the alarm on our phones (sidebar, but medical technology is great) to alert us than by smell, since the big issue is my wife will sleep through the low alarms, but he's figuring out the scent part of it, we just haven't really trained that one to reinforce the behavior.\n\nOne day she was showering, I was working in the basement, and the dog was sleeping on our bed right outside the bedroom as he likes to do. The phone was on the nightstand, and her low alarm went off when she was in the shower.  I thought I heard something in the basement, so I went up to check.  He was FREAKING the fuck out trying to find someone and figure out what to do.  He couldn't jump on my wife and bark at her like he's supposed to because there was a closed door between them. Same with finding me to alert me.  As soon as I opened the basement door he came a running to lead upstairs.",

But she was always on the other side of the little wall between the gallery and the well, where the attorneys sits. And she was always there before me and I left before her. \n\nI never knew she had a service dog until one day, the attorney sitting next to her was addressing the judge, but didn't stand up. The judge asked the speaking attorney to stand if she was able when addressing the court.\n\nThe lawyer said she didn't want to stand up because the service dog had rested its head on her foot and she didn't want to disturb it.\n\nThe woman with the service dog was mortified and asked the dog to move to the other side of her chair.\n\nFor like two years I had seen this woman like twice a week and never knew she had a service dog until the goodest, goldenest retriever popped out from under the table and walked around its owner's wheelchair and laid down on the other side.\n\nCourt proceedings are so incredibly boring that seeing the dog shake out its fur and mosey on around the room was like seeing a unicorn pop out of a rainbow.\n\nIt was a good day.",

I don't remember the condition they were servicing, but the owner was well enough so he walked through the scanners without the dog while the dog sat waiting for their turn. The owner went through no problems and then called the dog to take their turn to go through. It was so simple, but so amazing to me to see.\n\n\nI'm sure for the owner and dog that was just another day's work, but even in the most simple interactions we take for granted it was so obvious the bond between owner and that service dog. Great to see.",

Strap in, this is long form journal style and I don't do TL;DRs  \n\n\nUsually I go for a jog in my neighborhood after work, and yesterday wasn't an exception.  I burn some green, throw on hat, mask, shades, and get a nice jogging playlist going.  2 miles or so into my run I am in a good stride, vibing to my music and functionally withdrawn from the world at large.  \n\n\nI nearly jump out of my skin when a dog barks behind me, due in part to some nasty bitches I occasionally come across on my routes. This bark is not the normal \"person walking a dog\" bark that I am accustomed to, either. It has a peculiar edge to it.  Worse, it is so close I feel hot dog breath blow across my leg.  Turning around, I prepare myself to fight off a large aggressive hound; instead I am pleasantly surprised.  The dog is a tiny white mutt, reaching about halfway up my shin (ref [image](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/white-curly-haired-dog-bichon-frise-cute-pet-who-has-weighed-to-pounds-bichon-frise-dogs-classified-as-small-generally-97385960.jpg)).   The dog, which we will call Snowball, has backed off from me, alternating its stance between looking expectantly and barking for attention.  \n\n\nWhat is a man to do?  Snowball has no leash, something I have never come across on my neighborhood jogs, and he looks to be in doggy duress, an unsurprising state from a masterless mutt.  I remove cap, shades, and earpiece, now determined to return this dog to its masters.  As I contemplate how best to approach this objective (and reminiscing about a similar childhood experience) Snowball takes off.  Following him, I keep some healthy space between us as both an intentional buffer (I don't trust this dog quite yet) and an unintentional lag (hot, steep incline, short of breath).  Snowball comes to rest on his hind quarters at the opening of a cul-de-sac not far off, a blessing to my exhausted body.  Seeing the dog sit down like this eases my mind; he is totally harmless and as exhausted as I.  Snowball turns in to the street he leads me to his house, barking once he arrives.\n\nSnowball and I are greeted by his dog mother, who gives him a treat.  I relay my short tale and she expresses some concern. Her husband left with Snowball for a walk not too long ago, and it is quite unexpected for the dog to arrive, leashless, with a strange man.  \"That is concerning, I wish you the best of luck!\" I say as I leave.    \n\n\nThis situation has now become of the utmost interest to me and, knowing which direction the dog came from I resolve to put my physical training to some practical use and track down the husband.  I don't make it very far when I see a man holding an empty leash walking towards me.  As I get closer I hail him and make reassuring noises that Snowball has made it home safe to his wife.  The man has a faint resemblance to Stephen Fry, as well as a slight trail of dried blood originating from his forehead, ending on the left side of his nose.  With a composure that seemed part shock, part incredulity, he told me that a large dog attacked him.  He fell over when this angry hound jumped at him, knocking away his glasses, forgotten at the crime scene.  As we discuss events I feel the urge to press the man with questions, yet I resist.  Interrogation is not my style, as you may have seen; and besides, his wife pulls up along the road and I do not want to accost an injured man. I wish him well and he leaves.  \n\n\nThe story largely ends here.  It was my intention to find this rabid dog and contain it, or at the very least alert containment professionals; I was unable.  Two police cars drove past me with sirens blaring roughly 5 minutes later.  I can only assume it was to investigate reports of a loose and dangerous hound.  While I did attempt to chase a car (perhaps I'm a bit of a dog myself) my poor legs cannot keep up with vehicles and I was quickly outpaced.  Considering the circumstances I resolved to not stick my nose any deeper into this matter, except to check on a particularly aggressive neighborhood bitch, one which made lunges at me in the past.  \n\n\nAn empty yard greeted me.  No police, no dog.  I believe that I guessed wrong, but only the police report will tell, something that I eagerly await.",

                    "comment": "I almost had a story of this recently.\n\nI\u2019ve been going for walks around some marshes by my house to get exercise in lockdown, there\u2019s a lot of dog walkers in the area and since it\u2019s a big open space it\u2019s not uncommon to see dogs off the leash. Walking along an out-of-the-way path through a wooded area I see a dog up ahead. I assume the owner isn\u2019t far off and initially think nothing of it. As I get closer though, the dog starts acting like it wants me to follow it: looks at me, barks, takes a few steps towards the woods, stops and looks back at me, barks again, rinse and repeat.\n\nSo I think fuck it, I\u2019ve watched enough Lassie to see where this is going. Maybe the owner is in the woods and is hurt somehow, and the dog is trying to get help. Like I said this particular section of woods was very quiet, it\u2019s not rare for me to spend an hour or two walking through it without seeing another person, so if someone is hurt the chances of someone else coming along to find them are slim.\n\nI start to follow the dog; it\u2019s consistently running a few steps ahead of me, regularly stopping and looking back as if checking I\u2019m still following, barking if I fall behind. No sign of the owner or in fact anyone else. Then suddenly, something shifts. As I take a few steps after the dog, it turns and begins snapping at my legs and jumping up at my face, barking constantly. I take a few steps back and the dog is just staring me down, hackles raised. I turn to walk away and the dog jumps again, so I end up having to back away without breaking eye contact. I reach a distance that I feel is safe enough to look away, so I have a quick peek all around to see if I can see anyone, but there\u2019s no one there. I look back, and the dog is gone.\n\nI took a few minutes to steady myself (I\u2019ve never spent much time around big dogs so having it jump at me was unnerving) and then decide I have to scour the whole area before I feel okay leaving just in case someone is in trouble. Couldn\u2019t find anyone and didn\u2019t see the dog again, so I have no idea what was happening. The dog was clearly well cared for, fur was clean and brushed so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stray, but no collar, no leash, and no owner in sight, injured or otherwise. Weird day that was.",

That's one of the most extreme examples I can think of. My service dog warns me when I'm starting to panic too much and helps redirect my thinking to him. When people talk to him in stores not only does it distract him in the instant that they talk to him but he is distracted the rest of the time I'm in the store because he might get pets.",

It's fascinating to watch them work, and the people who receive them are over the moon. \n\nIf you ever need a great cathartic cry, go watch one of their \"graduation ceremonies\". It's an event where you see the dog being paired with the recipient. The puppy raisers come and tells about their experience with the dog, and the recipient tells about how it will change their life. It's so heart warming and there are no dry eyes at the end of the event.\n\nYou realize how blessed we are to have these animals in our life.",

    "postText": "I had a Heart Attack about 2 years ago and like to remind people that the symptoms and signs may not be what you would expect. \n\nYou also don\u2019t need to be what is generally considered \u2018high-risk\u2019 or have had  previous indications that you could be at risk. \n\nFor many people, it\u2019s exactly what you see on tv\u2026 sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, arm or shoulder pain and often loss of consciousness. Mine was quite different. Rather, it was waves of discomfort that slowly built up over hours from barely noticeable to extreme discomfort. \n\nThe chest, arm and shoulder pain were present BUT were not at all the \u201ctype\u201d of pain I expected. I had waves of tightness dead center in my chest which came and went every few minutes. It was a much more of a burning feeling. It was lower on my sternum than I\u2019d have thought. I had never had a heart attack nor indigestion so naturally, I assumed it was the latter **and my research online convinced me it was.** \n\nThe only thing I can relate the chest discomfort too would be when you swallow food that is way, way too hot and you can feel it burn down your chest. \n\nI always assumed a cardiac event would have been a sharper pain on my upper arm/shoulder and a sharper, more acute pain closer to where we (mistakenly) generalize our heart to be...upper left chest. In fact, **my symptoms were almost line-by-line identical to that of heartburn or indigestion ... it wasn\u2019t, and the difference can be life or death. \n**\nMy arms hurt but it was more of a burning pain on the back of both arms and slight, not severe. Maybe felt like a pinched nerve. I had always heard that a heart attack caused pain predominantly in one arm. I felt some in both and because I didn\u2019t clearly have pain in one arm more than the other, I downplayed the possibility of it being cardiac. \n\nVomiting and sweating followed a few hours into it which was the real big red flag...the ambulance not far behind the vomiting. The rest was a blur until the ICU but I do remember some of it. \n\nI made the common mistake of equating the symptoms to heartburn or indigestion and should have gone to the ER 10 hours sooner and therefore found myself VERY lucky to have made it through. \n\nPLS don\u2019t fuck around. I\u2019m not an older guy, I\u2019m not in bad shape and had never had indicators that I was high risk.\n\nA friends mother passed away a few years ago from a heart attack and by all accounts, it seemed to be a stomach bug. Nausea, hot spells and general stomach issues. Went to bed and never woke up, and in hindsight, if I knew then what we know now, we would have called for medical attention and possibly changed the outcome. She too wasn\u2019t at the age you\u2019d expect nor was she overweight or the typical high-risk category. Entirely different from what I experienced or would have expected from a cardiac event. \n\nIf you suspect a heart attack, do yourself and your loved ones a favor and treat it as such.\n\n Better to be safe and be in the ER than be stubborn and wind up in the morgue. \n\nTLDR - Symptoms and signs of a heart attack can vary from person to person and can be very different men to women. \n\nWHY YSK - **IT COULD BE YOU. IT COULD BE YOUR LOVED ONE. YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO BE ELDERLY, OVERWEIGHT OR PREDISPOSED. JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN\u2019T FEEL LIKE WHAT YOU MAY EXPECT, DOESN\u2019T MEAN YOU SHOULDN\u2019T TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. **\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**When I previously posted this, the common question was how I knew it wasn\u2019t anxiety**. I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had several pretty overwhelming panic attacks, in fact one that took me to the ER because I thought it was a heart attack ironically. *This was different*. **Something was very clearly happening, my mistake was attributing it to the wrong thing and mistakenly thinking I was clear because it didn\u2019t \u2018look like\u2019 a heart attack.**\n\n[Mayo Clinic Reading on Symptoms of a Heart Attack ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106)\n\n\nPotassium too. My wife went into cardiac arrest and had to be defibrillated because her Potassium had gotten dangerously low. But that\u2019s for another post.\n\nEDIT: To be very clear, I was well aware that something was wrong and it was getting worse. I also knew it was unfamiliar to me and that something wasn\u2019t right. I ignorantly chose to roll the dice that it was something trivial when, in hindsight, there were more than plenty of red flags I chose to brush off.",

His symptoms were not typical, he had no cardiac problems before, and it was not on our radar.  After a mid morning nap I went to check on him and found him unresponsive, too far gone for the paramedics to save him. The regret of not realizing something serious was happening earlier and getting him to the hospital is something I\u2019ll carry forever. I hope this helps save somebody else.",

Hours before she died, she asked me if I thought she should go to the ER, instead of waiting until the morning for a scheduled appointment she already had. I had never even heard of someone dying of a blood clot before, and I definitely didn't know the signs, so I reassured her that it would probably be fine to stay home.\n\nI did Google get symptoms, and Google was right to warn me it was almost certainly a blood clot and a life-threatening emergency, but I brushed that off because I didn't want to believe it I guess. My mom could've been saved if I'd just asked her to go to the ER. I'll have to live with that forever I guess.\n\nI hope you're doing ok these days, and I really hope you find a way to move past the guilt. It wasn't your fault, as you know, and your husband surely wouldn't have blamed you or wanted you to feel bad. Good luck, and may you spend the rest of your life absolutely smothered by love and support.",

He was a smoker and an alcoholic, but I didn\u2019t really come to terms with that until after he died.

He was also 6\u20197\u201d and there are cardiac risk factors for people that tall. We didn\u2019t do an autopsy. The best explanation our doctor and I generated was \u201ctoo much.\u201d Too much alcohol, tobacco, illness. \n\nOn the day, he has been up the night before with a bad cough and had some abdominal pain which we though was stress on his diaphragm. He didn\u2019t look good but he hadn\u2019t looked good for a couple of weeks after his stomach bug. He was pretty good about going to the ER when he felt like he needed to so I didn\u2019t push the issue when he said he didn\u2019t feel like he needed to go.

Surely that's a healthier way of living and won't cause any problems.  \nHonestly, I'm not even being hyperbolic, because that's *exactly* what these threads do to people even if they have no prior health anxiety, and it feels impossible to stop those overreactions once they're introduced into your life, because it's always \"***but what if!?!***\"  \nThreads like this kinda destroyed my life in this regard. Health anxiety is no joke and it's caused me far more problems that I never had before. I wish I could go back to just... doing what I can without overthinking if I'm going to be okay if I do X or Y? Living normally? I hate these threads. I swear they do more harm than good, even if the intentions are good.",

If it helps, I figure it\u2019s time to head to the ER if it\u2019s physical discomfort consisting of multiple symptoms at the same time (and the feeling is unusual or unfamiliar), or anything is acutely painful (7 or above) and is getting worse or failing to subside.\n\nHad my first kidney stone last month and I debated going to the ER on that one for a few hours until I realized I couldn\u2019t even think clearly enough to decide what to wear as I was trying to put on pants and shoes in case I needed to go to the ER. Funnily enough, I thought it was food poisoning for a while until the pain kept coming without the violent barfing/diarrhea that usually indicates my body is trying to expel something from my gut.\n\nIf the world narrows where the only thing I can attend to is present pain or physical discomfort (in excess of an hour or so) then it\u2019s ER time. Usually with my anxiety, my thoughts of dying share equal space with the sudden unrelenting gas pain in my chest that I am certain is an aortic dissection. So it\u2019s a sign for me that things are serious when the pain starts to overtake the thoughts.",

He went to the ER several times as our son was in the hospital and the pain would hit when he went out in the cold so he'd turn around and go back in. But since he was young, they never suspected heart and let him wait until there wasn't anything to find. I finally called our gp and asked for a stress test for him - he really liked us so he did it and next thing, my husband came to the hospital in an ambulance. He had no heart damage yet. Angioplasty was new then and they tried it but weren't thinking it would work as he was very blocked. But it did. He had a quad bypass 20 years ago so he's out of spare parts. No issues yet though. He's 70 now. The doctor who sawed his sternum said it was the thickest he'd ever seen and they figure that's why the pain was felt in back.\n\nMy childhood best friend's mom also had a heart attack quite young. She felt it mostly in her back as well. I think she was in her low 40s. She only died last year in her low 90s.",

            "comment": "Doctor here. You're right in that heart attack can cause different symptoms in different people.\n\nThe typical symptoms are generally a good guide for most people though and they are:\n1. Crushing chest pain (can either be in the middle or to the left side of chest).\n- Location of pain doesn't tell us much as long as it's not on the right side.\n- Burning/sharp pain is uncommon but can occur.\n- Pain can radiate to neck or jaw or down the left arm.\n- Slightly less common to radiate to the back but it does happen. However, if it does happen go to the doctor anyway because it can be VERY serious. Conditions with chest pain radiating to the back can be as mild as acid reflux to as serious as aortic dissection (a tear on the inner layer of your main blood vessel).\n\n2. Breathlessness \n\n3. Nausea and vomiting.\n\n4. Looking pale.\n\n5. Sweating a lot.\n\nAtypical symptoms usually happen in females, people with diabetes, and older people.\n- Burning chest pain.\n- Pain in the abdomen/tummy.\n- Pain in the back.\n- Stomach discomfort.\n- Weakness in arms.\n- Sometimes chest pain can be absent entirely.\n\nPlease go to the doctor if you feel unwell, especially if you are a smoker or have high blood pressure/high cholesterol/diabetes or if you use cocaine (it can cause a massive heart attack).\n\nUsually they will get an ECG/EKG (tracing of electrical activity of the heart) and perhaps blood tests as well. Sometimes if blood tests are equivocal, we do serial blood tests (1x on presentation, 1x ~3hr down the line). These will tell us definitely if there has been a heart attack or not.",

We have so many different intricate parts to our bodies, keeping us living, breathing, and conscious that strange sensations and random pains are inevitable. \n\nWhen I show up to people's emergencies, when it comes to things like this (especially without risk factors), one of the most important questions I'll ask is \"Has anything like this ever happened before?\". Sometimes I get a yes, sometimes I get a \"yeah but it's different\" or similar, but every once in a while I get a stern NO. Those are usually the ones having an actual cardiac event. \n\nThe reason I'm saying this is because above, there were some comments about being told by a cardiologist that \"you'll know\" when it's happening. I get what that means, it doesn't mean you won't have doubts, it means you'll know something is different this time. \n\nI also often get the people who are worrying too much about a normal or benign sensation, and I have no issue coming out to make sure that's the case. But it is important to accept that normal bodies don't act completely normal, and when something serious is going on, you usually know it's serious.",

For a long time, women were discharged from ERs with anxiety, nausea, abdominal pain, etc and never got an EKG. Later they would come back with other symptoms or more devastating consequences would happen. That\u2019s if they even came at all; often they themselves would dismiss symptoms due to the poor public education on the variety of symptoms. It really wasn\u2019t until the last 10-15 years that there has been a push in ER education to get an EKG on *anyone* presenting with anxiety, discomfort, abdominal pain, nausea, etc. and because of that, we\u2019re catching more MIs in women and the stats are changing.\n\nEdit: My numbers are a guesstimate based on a presentation I attended last month. I can\u2019t remember specifics, but the point is that \u201cmost common\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cmajority.\u201d",

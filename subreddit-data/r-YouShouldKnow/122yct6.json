Although the sentiment is nice, most people will not ask for help.",

What I do in these cases is, instead of putting the onus on them to reach out to me, I reach out to them.  I think about something they enjoy and invite them to spend time doing that with me, or if I know them well enough, I might invite myself over to their place, just to hang out.  You don't need to talk about the dog, but it usually helps. \n\nObviously not EVERYONE wants to spend time with you.  The internet introverts will be quick to jump on how they would HATE to have someone spend time with them, they just want to be alone, forever.  Good for them, but they are not most people.  I can tell you that when you lose someone you love it can feel very lonely and life feels empty, and people don't know how to respond and often avoid you and the subject because it's uncomfortable.",

Because of this, I\u2019ve grown to believe that we aren\u2019t mind readers and if people need something, we should all have the capability to speak up for ourselves and ask for it no matter how hard it may be. Otherwise, if we always expect others to know and do what we need and they miss it sometimes, that can really lead to some pretty harsh and unnecessary resentment.",

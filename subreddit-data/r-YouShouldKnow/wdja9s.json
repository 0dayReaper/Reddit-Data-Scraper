In case of an emergency situation and an urgent need to leave the cabin, it is very important that the person can immediately orient himself to his surroundings outside the plane and not wait for his eyes to become accustomed to bright light or darkness.",

And then the passengers get carried away with it like a toy and for the first hour of the flight the cabin looks like a dance floor with light show tunes.",

Don't argue, don't make a fuss or throw a children tantrum\n\nYes, you are absolutely right, and thank you for pointing that out. Of course most of the time we just have to greet passengers, help with luggage, deliver food and take out the trash, but we are also trained to survive in extreme conditions, do CPR, Heimlich maneuver, deliver babies, fighting and much more :)",

Note that many people hold on to the armrests during takeoff and landing. And any person during turbulence immediately grabs the armrest. Another important point. In case the plane has a strong roll it will keep you from falling into the aisle and prevent the neighboring passengers from collapsing on you.",

I assume this is because the sun would rise much earlier due to our velocity, and the brightness would disturb sleep.",

Also, the distance between the seats should be calculated taking into account the safety distance. A person has exactly 0.1 second to raise his hand and protect his head in case of danger, so the seat must also be raised to have enough distance.",

They are not solely there to serve you drinks and peanuts or to get you to sign up for credit cards that their corporate overlords make them push. Also, they literally can and will turn this motherfucking plane around or have police take you into custody at your destination if you want to be an asshole. They do a very difficult and stressful job 30000ft in the air and I know most people are cool, but some people need to know that Stephanie and Zack aren't in charge of overbooked flights, cancelations, lost luggage, gate changes, rebookings, the cost of booze, the fact that you woke up late, etc. Hopefully it will never happen, but they are the first responders in case of any emergency. So treat them like that. That is all. \n\n-person that flies all the time for work and sees the absolute entitled godawful behavior of fellow passengers.",

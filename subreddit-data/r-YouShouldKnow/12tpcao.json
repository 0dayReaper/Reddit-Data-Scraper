    "postText": "Why YSK: This type of thing happened more about 2 years ago, but still happens now. What occasionally does happen, and I don't know computery stuff so I don't know how this is possible, but you can place a delivery order, get the confirmation email, and then click the status of order button and have an \"oops, page not found\" appear, with no proof of order other than your cards being charged and a confirmation email. Taking a second to check will save you the trouble of wondering the next day of where your order is and being confused when you don't see it listed under \"past purchases\"\n\nHas happened to me, happened to friends, better safe than sorry, after your order goes through always click the link in the email or check the app or site to see if your order is there, to make sure the site isn't glitching. Sooner it's taken care of the better.\n\nEdit: The process I usually end up going through with customer service is initially they act like they don't know what I am talking about, Ie \"all we see is 'completely different order' could you be talking about that?\" Then \"are you sure\" then they ask for amount spent, time order was placed, order number, what type of payment used, last 3 of payment card. In between all of this they will be gone for looooooong stretches of time, I believe it is to make you give up. Just repeat yourself every 5 minutes. Tell them to get IT. Then they will say just dispute it with your bank, it will be fine. DON'T DO THIS!\n\nThere is no way they have no proof of transaction anywhere, especially if your bank is saying you were charged and you have a confirmation email.\n\nFor some reason they never want the confirmation email. Keep on pushing for a supervisor, they will try to dissuade you from this, too. Wait for supervisor, (long wait) they will go over the info, give them the email attached with your walmart account. They will say they will escalate a complaint for you. DO NOT TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT! Get a complaint number to track it.\n\nscreenshot everything or take a pic idk\n\nBy morning it will be fixed. Shit, after seeing myself write down everything I do to get a refund/my order, I truly believe this is built into the system now and the reps are instructed to dissuade you by any means from getting a refund. Can't believe I put up w that shit.",

But you also have to realize Walmart has closed several locations due to theft. There\u2019s definitely a communication issue and if our side can\u2019t see the order it\u2019s hard to give a refund without thinking they/we are being scammed. \n\nI want/need/deserve a raise so I agree with you on them being able to loosen up the purse. I really do think it\u2019s the tech, Walmart is all about the customer and it sucks that this happens, maybe the site needs a better paper trail/logging system to monitor orders that get screwed over. I have no idea, I\u2019m just a mid level engineer, but I\u2019ll try to bring this up. Not sure how far it\u2019ll go. I might have to delete my comments so I don\u2019t give myself away :(",

Never ordered anything from them before, ever; rural area and almost our only shopping option for athletic gear.\n\nThey arrived boxed and wrapped in plastic. No company identity, no instructions, no model #, nothing ... I couldn't look up how to telescope and lock them in place because I had no website to look at. \n\nI brought them to the local store and CS couldn't find them in their system at all. She looked up a several other trekking poles but this one didn't appear *anywhere.* She said that wasn't uncommon with third party vendors; they use a lot of them and thought they had been removed.\n\nI eventually found someone familiar with trekking poles; he had to force and snap them into place with great difficulty. They're okay ... but keep your receipt and *Walmart shipping label* if you feel the need to return something.",

Ordered 4 tires and set up an installation online and they cancelled the order less than 30 minutes later because they didn't have them in stock. So I redo the order but set the installation time for a week later when it will supposedly be in stock. Minus waiting for the refund, which also takes a week, everything is good. \n\nThe day of the order about 3 hours before I'm set to get them tires installed the order gets \"delayed\". I reach out to support where a kind woman from with a very foreign accent tells me I must cancel the order because there's some processing issue that can't be fixed. After some prodding I finally have her cancel the order and add the tires to the cart again but by this time I'm done. I get a refund, which was done in multiple amounts for some reason and I get the tires done elsewherere.\n\nThis was a week later and I'm still missing about $80 from the refund of the second order\n\nUpdate: I called them and despite what online support told me, the phone support told me they didn't process the full refund so I'm getting my money back eventually.",

There\u2019s definitely a lot of issues with the website. \n\nI was at a store in Canada, often times most employees don\u2019t give a shit and will give you free stuff or money back if something is messed up, or a manager will contact someone so that the reviews of the store aren\u2019t dropping. It can\u2019t hurt to be persistent with store level employees but don\u2019t be a dick about it, that won\u2019t go anywhere. Just insist (nicely) that something went wrong and they\u2019ll either find someone who can help you, or refer you to customer service online/on the phone, since most stores don\u2019t have the capability to deal with those issues. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely good advice to screenshot everything, especially any confirmation numbers that it emails, or displays on the order screen. Those are key to finding any order especially if your name/address/phone number/email aren\u2019t working to look it up. Often times the elderly would think they placed an order and arrive at the store with a screenshot of their cart, that is not helpful, and doesn\u2019t actually confirm that the order was placed. Typically it is an issue where they don\u2019t actually fully place the order or forget to click checkout.",

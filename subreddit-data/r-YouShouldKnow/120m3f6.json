    "postText": "Large Language Models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 act as a sort of Rosetta Stone for transforming human text into machine readable object formats. I cannot stress how much of a key problem this solved for software engineers like me. This allows us to take any arbitrary human text and transform it into easily usable data.\n\nWhile this acts as a major boon for some 'good' industries (for example, parsing resumes into objects should be majorly improved... thank god) , it will also help actors which do not have your best interests in mind. For example, say police department x wants to monitor the forum posts of every resident in area y, and get notified if a post meets their criteria for 'dangerous to society', or 'dangerous to others', they now easily can. In fact it'd be excessively cheap to do so. This post for example, would only be around 0.1 cents to parse on ChatGPT's API.\n\nWhy do I assert this will happen? Three reasons. One, is that this will be easy to implement. I'm a fairly average software engineer, and I could guarantee you that I could make a simple application that implements my previous example in less than a month (assuming I had a preexisting database of users linked to their location, and the forum site had a usable unlimited API). Two, is that it's cheap. It's extremely cheap. It's hard to justify for large actors to NOT do this because of how cheap it is. Three is that AI-enabled surveillance is already happening to some degree: [https://jjccihr.medium.com/role-of-ai-in-mass-surveillance-of-uyghurs-ea3d9b624927](https://jjccihr.medium.com/role-of-ai-in-mass-surveillance-of-uyghurs-ea3d9b624927)\n\nNote: How I calculated this post's price to parse:\n\nThis post has \\~2200 chars. At \\~4 chars per token, it's 550 tokens.  \n550 /1000 = 0.55 (percent of the baseline of 1k tokens)  \n0.55 \\* 0.002 (dollars per 1k tokens) = 0.0011 dollars.\n\n[https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)  \n[https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them)\n\nWhy YSK: This capability is brand new. In the coming years, this will be implemented into existing monitoring solutions for large actors. You can also guarantee these models will be run on past data. Be careful with privacy and what you say online, because it will be analyzed by these models.",

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but:\n\nAn AI (if it can be called that at that point) like that would understand that humans are incredibly influenced by their nature. Lazy, can't see far into the future, and afraid of new things. First of all, it would thus be irrational to even expect humans to contribute to its' creation. \n\nSecondly, torturing the \"humans\" who did not help its' creation is in itself an irrational action, as it contributes nothing to the fact beside gratification, which, if we are to believe it to be completely rational, is absolute nonsense. The only way in which it would make sense would be to incentives humans who know of Roko's Basilisk now to act, which, given how irrational us humans are, would not really work.",

So, his brilliant proposal to fix this \u201cissue\u201d is by removing all forms of leizure activities and hobbies from being accessible by the working class in order to prevent them from doing anything else other than innovate and work.\n\nDidn\u2019t even pause in listing what activities he\u2019d have made illegal to get this done, including: playing sports, having parties, bars, clubs, hobbies such as art and music creation, playing video or board games, reading for pleasure, psychedelics specifically as well.

They literally have contests for new algorithms, then privately analyze and determine which one they're going to force everyone else to standardize to. If the government wanted backdoors in encryption it's millions of times more likely that they're just sneaking them in during their private, closed-door determinations and analysis then that they're letting extremely difficult to crack schemes past because they've leapfrogged quantum computing technology by decades.",

Presumably they have them locked down very well but the fact that they even have the keys is the problem. It's not like they're using it to spy on 300 million americans, they already have ISPs and more to do that. This tool is like if you were a special political dissident and encrypted your computer and had very good OpSec, the government could ask intel to give them the keys in and own your computer in no time. Intel would be forced to comply with a warrant or a subpoena, they would fold instantly. There's been serious conversations that the government might've been the people who asked intel to make the keys in the first place.\n\nAs well, the dissemination of extremely fundamental security vulnerabilities doesn't really work like that. There's multi million if not billion dollar industries built around security vulnerabilities. If someone compromised the Intel IME keys they would sell that information for a hundred million  dollars to the highest bidder nation state. That nation state would then require the individual selling it to destroy any copy that they had so that the nation state would have all the power and know that no-one could use it against them. Nation states have many many many security vulnerabilities that don't get disseminated widely to script kiddies and darknet markets. As well, no script kiddie is going to try to run some IME hack on your computer, it's nontrivial for a person to execute but would be easily done by a government. There's much easier ways for a kid or really any individual human to own computers. Phishing, social engineering, all the things we see that are popular today. Those are all the popular things for a reason, they're what people can do.\n\nAnd finally last reason that this isn't getting used en mass is that every sophisticated organization knows that if they let their usage become an obvious problem, it will force the company to close the back door/change the keys/issue recall. If you've got a net with access to a hundred political dissidents phones, it would be stupid to start installing it on library computers and other people's infrastructure. Sooner or later a sophisticated individual is going to see it, raise the alarm, and then the party's over.\n\nThe real risk with the IME isn't that whoever is using it to access everybody's data, or even just your data. It's probably used very sparingly and there's other easier ways to get in. The problem is that the easier ways to access can be thwarted. If you're smart enough and paranoid enough you can avoid all the emails and downloads and shit. You can boot off your own software, use burners, encrypt, do all the things you should do. The real risk of the IME is that it cannot be stopped. You can't prevent whoever has the keys from getting in, no matter what you do. If your computer can communicate with any other computer, you can't stop it. That's the real danger.",

            "comment": "Text Analysis:\n\nThe text highlights the potential for large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, to revolutionize surveillance by efficiently parsing and interpreting human text. The author expresses concern about the ease, affordability, and existing instances of AI-enabled surveillance, which could lead to the widespread use of these tools by actors who may not have the best interests of individuals in mind.\n\nStrategy to prevent misuse of LLMs in surveillance:\n\nRaise awareness: Inform the public about the potential risks of AI-powered surveillance, emphasizing the importance of privacy and caution when sharing information online.\nAdvocate for clear and comprehensive regulations: Lobby for the establishment of legal frameworks that regulate the use of LLMs for surveillance purposes. Encourage strict rules, transparency, and accountability in the deployment of such technologies by government and private entities.\nEncourage ethical AI development: Promote the development and adoption of ethical guidelines for AI research and implementation. This includes incorporating privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy and federated learning, in the design of LLMs.\nSupport privacy-enhancing technologies: Encourage the use of encryption, anonymization, and other privacy-enhancing tools that can help protect individual data and communication from unauthorized access or surveillance.\nMonitor and expose misuse: Establish independent watchdog organizations to track and expose cases of AI-powered surveillance misuse. These organizations can help hold governments and corporations accountable for any violations of privacy or human rights.\nDevelop and promote alternative, privacy-preserving AI applications: Support research into AI technologies that enhance privacy, rather than compromise it. Encourage the development of AI applications that empower users and protect their privacy.\nPromote digital literacy: Educate the public on the importance of digital privacy and security, as well as ways to safeguard their personal information online. This includes teaching individuals how to evaluate the credibility of websites, use strong passwords, and avoid sharing sensitive information on public forums.\nBy implementing these strategies, we can help mitigate the risks associated with the misuse of LLMs in surveillance, promoting a more privacy-conscious society that values individual rights and freedoms.",

A 5-step plan to start implementing these strategies could be:\n\nThe time required to complete all five steps will vary depending on several factors, such as the complexity of the issue, the level of existing awareness, the receptiveness of policymakers, and the resources available to the coalition. However, a rough estimate for the completion of each step could be:\n\nForm a coalition: 1-3 months\nBuilding a coalition of diverse stakeholders requires time to identify, contact, and secure commitments from the participants.\nDevelop clear messaging: 1-2 months\nCrafting a compelling and concise narrative requires research, collaboration, and feedback from stakeholders.\nConduct awareness campaigns: 3-12 months\nAwareness campaigns can take time to plan, execute, and measure their impact. The duration will depend on the scale and scope of the campaign, as well as the resources available for promotion and engagement.\nDraft policy proposals: 3-6 months\nDeveloping comprehensive policy proposals requires research, consultation with experts, and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the proposals are well-founded and practical.\nEngage with policymakers: 6-24 months\nEngaging with policymakers can be a lengthy process, as it involves building relationships, presenting proposals, and advocating for change. The time required will depend on the complexity of the issue, the legislative agenda, and the willingness of policymakers to address the concerns.\nConsidering these estimates, the entire process could take anywhere from 1 to 3 years to complete all steps. However, it's essential to recognize that these steps may also overlap, and the actual time required will depend on the specific circumstances and resources available.",

However, some factors can influence the likelihood of success:\n\nPublic sentiment: The success of efforts to prevent AI-powered surveillance will depend on the level of public awareness and concern about the issue. If the public is well-informed and actively engaged in advocating for privacy, it is more likely that policymakers will take the matter seriously and implement necessary regulations.\nPolicy progress: Success will also depend on the pace at which new policies are developed and enacted. If comprehensive regulations addressing AI-powered surveillance are implemented swiftly, it is more likely that the deployment of threatening technology can be prevented or limited.\nInternational cooperation: Surveillance technology does not respect borders, and as such, international collaboration is essential. If countries can work together to establish global standards and share best practices, the likelihood of preventing or mitigating the threat of AI-powered surveillance will increase.\nTechnological advancements: The development of privacy-preserving technologies and AI applications that empower users can help counterbalance the risks posed by AI-powered surveillance. If such technologies advance rapidly and are widely adopted, they may help offset the potential threats.\nCorporate responsibility: If technology companies prioritize ethical considerations and incorporate privacy by design principles, they can play a crucial role in preventing the misuse of AI-powered surveillance technology. Corporate responsibility initiatives can help foster a more privacy-conscious industry.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the exact chances of preventing the implementation of threatening AI-powered surveillance technology within three years, the combined efforts of stakeholders, policymakers, and the public can significantly increase the likelihood of success.",

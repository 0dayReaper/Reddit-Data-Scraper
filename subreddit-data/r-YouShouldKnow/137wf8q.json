    "postText": "Why YSK: If you use edge or the Bing app in your phone you have access to Bing; the thing is that Bing has now a Chat function that is powered by AI. And by AI, I mean ChatGPT. And by ChatGPT, I mean ChatGPT 4. \n\nNot just that, but Bing has access to the internet and also pdf files. It\u2019s also completely free. What Im trying to say is that you can literally ask Bing pretty much any question and it\u2019ll answer. Even like really specific questions that you couldn\u2019t possibly find on Google. In addition:\n\nYou can open any scientific paper you want on Edge as a pdf file and ask any question about it that you couldn\u2019t understand and it\u2019ll answer it \n\nYou can open a web page and ask anything written on it and it\u2019ll provide context or explain it to you \n\nYou can literally ask it to write fucking code for you, and it\u2019ll do it\n\nBasically it\u2019s a personal assistant on steroids that does a few things that even ChatGPT 4 can\u2019t do. Like, ChatGPT 4 doesn\u2019t have access to the internet or to pdf files or anything, and Bing does. It\u2019s an huge productivity tool that many people are still sleeping on",

You can access it by going to bing.com/chat or by clicking on the chat icon on the bottom right corner of the Bing homepage.\nBing Chat is powered by a generative artificial intelligence that can understand and communicate fluently in more than 100 languages. It can also create images based on your prompts using the image creator feature.\nSome of the things you can do with Bing Chat are:\n\nSearch for information on any topic and get relevant and comprehensive answers\n\nGenerate content such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, celebrity parodies and more\n\nRewrite, improve, or optimize your content with suggestions and feedback\n\nFind and play movies and shows on streaming services with one command\n\nGet weather updates, news headlines, sports scores, stock prices and more\n\nHave fun and engaging conversations with jokes, trivia, games and personality quizzes\n\nBing Chat is still in preview mode, so it may not be perfect. But it is constantly learning and improving from your feedback and interactions. You can also customize your chat settings by choosing between balanced, creative and precise modes.\nBing Chat is a new way to experience the web using natural language and artificial intelligence. You should try it out and see what it can do for you!",

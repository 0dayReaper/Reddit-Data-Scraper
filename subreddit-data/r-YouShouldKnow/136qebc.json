    "postText": "Why YSK: The situation is more complex than the Brazilian government thought and new actions need to be taken urgently because the lives of indigenous people in the region are in danger.  \n\n\nGovernment security forces in Brazil clashed with illegal miners and invaders, on Sunday (30) night, who continue to operate in the Yanomami Indigenous Territory, leaving four alleged criminals killed in the aftermath.\n\nReportedly, during an aerial inspection operation, officers from the Federal Highway Police and the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), were attacked by the illegal miners who attempted to shoot down the helicopter patrolling the area, leading to the shootout.\n\n[https://brazilreports.com/brazilian-government-to-reinforce-security-in-the-yanomami-indigenous-land-after-violence-increased-in-the-region/4659/](https://brazilreports.com/brazilian-government-to-reinforce-security-in-the-yanomami-indigenous-land-after-violence-increased-in-the-region/4659/)\n\nFollowing the confrontation, federal agents found a war arsenal with rifles, shotguns, pistols, and plenty of ammunition at the miner\u2019s camp.\n\nThe day before, invaders attacked a village in the Uxu\u00ed community, north of the Yanomami territory, and shot three young indigenous people. One died shortly after being shot, while the other two were rescued.",

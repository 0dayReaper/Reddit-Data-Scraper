    "postText": "If someone you know is experiencing an intense throbbing pain localised to one spot (often behind either their left or right eye), can't look at bright lights and feels intense nausea; they have a migraine. Not a headache. The only thing that will help them is a dark room, somewhere to vomit, and time. Migraines can last upwards of 2 or 3 days.\n\nMigraines can also cause visual hallucinations including flashing lights or bright spots, seeing geometric shapes, or even vision loss. This is a 'migraine with aura', as opposed to a 'migraine without aura' which tends to just involve **intense** pain and nausea.\n\nWhy YSK:  Whether you or someone you know is experiencing a migraine with aura or a migraine without aura, you cannot treat it the same way you would a headache. Don't expect a migraine to go away immediately, don't expect a migraine to disappear with painkillers and water. Migraine sufferers need a dark room, somewhere to be sick, and time. You can't treat a migraine like a headache.\n\nSource:\n\n[https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2019/november/migraines-vs-headaches](https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2019/november/migraines-vs-headaches)\n\n[https://migrainetrust.org/understand-migraine/types-of-migraine/migraine-with-aura/](https://migrainetrust.org/understand-migraine/types-of-migraine/migraine-with-aura/)\n\n[https://migrainetrust.org/understand-migraine/types-of-migraine/migraine-without-aura/](https://migrainetrust.org/understand-migraine/types-of-migraine/migraine-without-aura/)",

Of course when your head is screaming and you have blurry tunnel vision it\u2019s hard to fall asleep. \n\nEventually I stopped getting them, but randomly about 5-7 years ago I randomly got ocular migraines. Ended up in the ER because I was terrified something was messing with my vision. They told me what they are and I got a few more over the next several months. They were better than the full blown migraine as without the pain it was much easier to fall asleep. Then those stopped too. \n\nI haven\u2019t had so much as a headache since then. Not sure what the actual fuck that was about, but I hope they stay away. Sucks.",

I get auras for 45-60 minutes, eventually losing about \u00bd-\u2154 of my vision (this was pretty fucking scary when it happened the first time). At the end or slightly after the auras I get a pretty bad but not crippling headache which lasts about an hour or so.\n\nI find the auras really interesting since, for me, it's always the right side of my vision that goes out first, with a pretty clear border around the horizontal middle (including the macula, that always goes out first). I suspect that that shows me the border between what the left half and the right half of the visual cortex process, but it might just have a different cause.",

I had to Will myself asleep under covers and then when I woke up I physically felt like I had run a marathon. \n\nI used to get them every month. My mom said I should track them related to my period. Turns out there was a correlation. I brought this up to my obgyn and she took me off birth control pills because they up your risk of stroke. Got an IUD, saw a neurologist. I used to get them monthly, now I\u2019m down to four or so a year. Might be worth exploring?",

I started taking it because most of my cramps come from blood clots, and the asprin breaks those up. I also noticed that ginko (normally used for memory and circulation) also helped make migraines go away faster. So, I guess anything that helps with circulation / reduces clots could be useful for reducing migraine frequency? \n\nIt's not a bad solution since all that stuff is also supposed to reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke.",

They didn't last days for her and never made her sick, but she'd get the flashing lights, the aura effects, and intense pain. Sometimes they'd also be accompanied by mild aphasia.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because this used to happen very frequently.... right up until she had a hemorrhagic stroke. She's ok now. Suffered some damage that affects her memory but no paralysis or anything like that. The point is that following the stroke (and the prescription of blood pressure meds that actually did something) the frequency of her migraines fell off sharply.\n\nIf you or someone you know are experiencing frequent migraines, it's worth talking to a doctor about it. Check blood pressure over a period of time. If it's consistently high talk to a damn doctor and get that shit under control. A stroke is not something you want to deal with either as a patient or as a family member.\n\nTrust me.",

Both eyes are affected. These almost always pass in 30 minutes, and should definitely pass in 45 minutes--I set a timer to make sure mine do.\n\nIf this happens to you in just one eye, or does not pass in 45 minutes, you should definitely get to a doctor as many of the symptoms can also be symptoms of a retinal tear and you risk blindness in the eye if you don't get it treated. And frankly, if you get them more than once, you should see a doctor anyway--both your PCP *and* an optometrist. Too many folks out there have enough vision to drive and haven't been to an optometrist in years, but those yearly scans can catch very, very nasty things before they get a chance to be debilitating.",

After making my husband take me to the er one night for arm numbness and chest pain...both considered aura without migraine I later found out. I've had regular migraines since college that were well controlled with topimirate and rizatriptan. I had a wonderful neurologist who ended up retiring and the one I was stuck with after told me all my symptoms (intense chest and arm pain with visual aura and dizziness) were all caused by my carpal tunnel \ud83d\ude11 \n\nAs soon as I switched specialists, I was immediately diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine. We tried Topamax again by was disqualified due to new side effects (intense almost painful tingling in the center of my foot)\nThere were a LOT of other options for prevention rx and my neuro asked me to pick.  I took some time to research and decided to take amitriptyline, an antidepressant, and its been amazing. My symptoms started 6 months or so after quitting birth control cold turkey after my wedding. I had been on BC continuously since 16. I've also taken antidepressants off and on through my early adulthood. \n\nApparently,  hemiplegic migraine is rather rare so it is not well researched, especially on the treatment side. I found a really helpful research paper that helped make my choice on prevention rx that I linked below. Also I'm only able to take Ubrelvy at onset due to the vascular nature of hemiplegic migraine. \n\nFun fact: Women suffer from migraines 3-1 over men! Anyway I hope this helps a confused potential hemiplegic migraine patient.\n\n[Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of hemiplegic migraine ](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/91/7/764)",

If you have a family history of hemiplegic migraine this might be it, or a rare sporadic mutation\n\nIf it\u2019s not hemiplegic migraines (which only a brain scan can tell) it could be many other dangerous neurological conditions, including a tumor or TIA. \n\nEither way I highly recommend getting a professional to look at you, especially if you can get a head start on medication for symptom relief (which can take multiple weeks to work)",

It seems to come with a tense muscle somewhere in the body but mostly in the neck or upper back.  Rubbing it and massaging helps.  This seems to be absolutely clear that it helps.  So I took that data and continued watching the atmosphere she is in when she gets one.    Seems 90 percent of the time it\u2019s outside and sun is shining.   Then as I narrowed it further it was outside and either sun or stadium lights at night that may have been to bright for her.   Then tried sunglasses outside day with sun or night with stadium lights.    I think it\u2019s safe to say it just outside.   Take Zyrtec and bring muscle relaxers (Valium ).    This seems to actually stop the migraine from getting worse and it will end a lot faster.   This has proved to help every time now.    That\u2019s what we found for her.   Hope this helps",

OTC meds don't do anything, so insurance eats up half of my income in order to cover my non generic medication. It's absolutely a disability though it's not recognized as one, and I frequently have to just learn to function while debilitated. Lots of people try to give input on their headache cures and I have a mantra that their lack of understanding doesn't make my pain less valid. A mantra I need to have or I'll absolutely lose it one of these days when someone asks me if I've tried electrolytes or neck stretches. The reality is I just have incredibly strong fatigue and even if I can dull the other symptoms, I'm dragging myself through the day one moment at a time until I can sit down again and close my eyes \n\n\nI think the hardest part is how isolating it is, and having to mask the pain. I can't see the point in looking forward to anything because there's a good chance I won't be able to enjoy any plans I make, so I end up being a crappy friend. I'm very good at convincing myself that it's not that bad even though I'm dizzy, nauseous and fantasizing about death from the pain. I go to work at my (physically active) job in customer service. But I feel like I annoy everyone with how frequently the pain makes me dumb and lame to be around. When they last more than one day I become irritable. I feel like if I stay home people would hold it against me, but if I come to work and I can't fully mask the pain they'll also be annoyed. I figure, if I'm going to be in pain all day I might as well get paid to do it. Especially since if I have a migraine at home I can't motivate myself to do anything and it's a massive time waste. There are very few things I wouldn't do to never get a migraine again.",

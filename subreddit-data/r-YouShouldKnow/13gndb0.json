If that does not work, you can turn off the engine (BE AWARE THIS WILL RESULT IN A LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND BREAKING). Then you can either let the car roll out or use the breaks. Apply the handbrake only slowly and be prepared for the car to spin out.",

Modern cars made in the last few years have a digital button rocker instead of a mechanical handbrake lever and if you pull up on it the car will operate itself to quickly and smoothly come to a complete stop. It's good advice in case of an emergency. I know for a fact it works because I've been teaching someone to drive in a corolla and I've used the handbrake button to stop the car.",

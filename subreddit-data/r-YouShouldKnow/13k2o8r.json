    "postText": "Why YSK: You could be overpaying your house payments due to paying PMI when you don't need to. \n\nIf you are currently paying mortgage insurance (PMI) because you don't have 20% equity in your house you might be able to have your house reappraised and the PMI removed due to the value of your house increasing.\n\nFor example, I bought my house in 2020 for $200,000 with a down payment of $10,000. Due to the insane increase in house prices I called the mortgage company and paid $250 for someone to come and reappraise my house. The new value was $300,000 which meant my equity was over the 20% threshold and the PMI was taken off of my next payment. Overall it saved me several thousand dollars in PMI payments. \n\nFrom experience you normally have to wait 2 years before you can have your house reappraised unless you have made 'significant improvements' (we added a fence in our backyard and they said that qualified)",

My bank refused to remove the PMI, though, for reasons still unclear other than being unethical, so i ended up refinancing and getting a new mortgage elsewhere that didn't include PMI",

There are 7 or 10 year rates also). After those locked in years, you need to renew. If you still require insurance on your mortgage, you need to go through CHMC to provide the insurance. Most people gain enough equity in their house over 5 years that the 20% doesn't matter. \n\nFor example, in 2007, I bought my starter house for 550,000 ( expensive for a starter, but I live in the Vancouver area of B.C. which is one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world). 5 years after purchasing it, it was worth somewhere upwards of 750, 000. When I renewed my mortgage after 5 years, I had enough equity in the house that I didn't need CHMC. All the bank wanted for approval of my mortgage was either mortgage insurance or life insurance for the value of the property.\n\nSo, yeah. If you make significant improvements and gain 20% equity, you wouldn't need to pay the CHMC fee. You would, however, have to renew early and pay an early renewal penalty. Sometimes, it is the interest for the remaining months. Sometimes, it is the interest for the 3 months. There is usually a penalty, though.",

Two people working at McDonald's can afford a larger loan than the one we got because McDonald's pays like 18 an hour and the CoL is so much lower. In contrast in Arizona a similar size home would likely be going for 400k right now easy on any of the desirable cities.",

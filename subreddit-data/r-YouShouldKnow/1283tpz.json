A bunch of folks that knew Greek and Latin in the 16th century started adding silent letters to words so they were more reflective of similar words in Greek or Latin. Other examples include \"subtle\" and \"debt\" gaining a silent \"b\".  The irony of this big brain jerk off is that not all of the words they changed are even really linked to Latin or Greek such as \"island\".\n\nhttps://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/island\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/pronunciation-of-indict",

English is weird) but etymology is awesome, you can learn a lot about meanings of words by finding similar roots. \n\nThe Spanish word \"decir\" (to say) shares the same root word.

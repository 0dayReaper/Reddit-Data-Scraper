And I don\u2019t see any reason they won\u2019t last another ten years or so. The video signal does seem to degrade more than the actual tape itself, which requires me to use time base correctors and frame stabilizers to transfer them correctly. A good low budget way to play vhs tapes and keep decent sync is to run it through a dvd recorder. Consumer dvds are the worst in my opinion. I\u2019m constantly dealing with corrupted vob files, making it hard to recovers home movies that way.",

I always felt the MPEG2 real-time encoder was crap so I would capture as raw nearly uncompressed AVI files through VirtualDub (HuffyUV compression, and sync audio enabled), and then re-encode them with an app called TMPGEnc and burn as a DVD Video disc.  Depending on the length of the video, a 2 hour one would take nearly most of the day to encode on a Pentium 4 processor (I did something called Half-D1 resolution which cuts the time in half without sacrificing quality as I didn't need the full DVD resolution for VHS).  Fun times!  I think I did well if I couldn't tell the difference between a VHS copy and a \"blocky\" digital copy (especially if the source material is messy).\n\nI actually got a hold of some recent older VHS tapes and felt the need to transfer these digitally a couple years back.  Instead of doing new research, I busted out all the old equipment and computer I used to do it on, lol.  That was very nostalgic for me.",

Is it a VHS, VHS-C, or Video8/Hi8/Digital8? Buy the appropriate deck for it off eBay. Preferably get something with a time base corrector (first link explains this). Pick up an Elgato USB capture device or appropriate capture card (avoid super cheap stuff unless it's used), and stream it in to your PC with AmarecTV or VirtualDub. Then convert and de-interlace accordingly. Lots of good advice in that first main thread. Check it out and get those tape digitized right! A lot of big box digitizing places do the absolute worst job possible so you could probably get much better results doing DIY. There are services recommended on Digital FAQ and other forums that do it professionally if you don't want to do that though.",

Those were some of the last vhs players that hit the market, usually vhs and dvd recorder combo. Benefit is they have a good analog-&gt;digital converter buildin, minimizing losses you would otherwise get over component cables. You want to minimize losses with old tapes. \n\nThen take a cheap hdmi to usb capture card and use OBS studio to capture in native 480i/520i or set to 720p so the vcr handles deinterlacing the best it can. For hdmi capture I used an elgato hd60s since I had one already, but you can find them much cheaper.\n\nResults were acceptable for my 20yr old long play tape with high school memories. By no means the original quality, but original quality wasn't the best as I remember anyway. Also be aware that playing a digitized version on a high resolution monitor or TV now will look worse than the same vhs playing on a ntsc TV, you will remember the quality being much better which it probably was.\n\nCheck out the youtuber technology connections, he did a whole in depth episode about this. https://youtu.be/ZC5Zr3NC2PY",

Is it a VHS, VHS-C, or Video8/Hi8/Digital8? Buy the appropriate deck for it off eBay. Preferably get something with a time base corrector (first link explains this). Pick up an Elgato USB capture device or appropriate capture card (avoid super cheap stuff unless it's used), and stream it in to your PC with AmarecTV or VirtualDub. Then convert and de-interlace accordingly. Lots of good advice in that first main thread. Check it out and get those tape digitized right! A lot of big box digitizing places do the absolute worst job possible so you could probably get much better results doing DIY. There are services recommended on Digital FAQ and other forums that do it professionally if you don't want to do that though.",

Maybe Costco might be better versus my small store experience but that worked for me well.",

Luckily, I found a service called Everpresent and not only do they give you a lot of options for delivery, they also return the originals to you! I\u2019m happy to say the service was great and I recommend anyone who wants to save their families memories to check them out! It\u2019s worth every penny and I think reasonably priced given the DIY approach.\n\nhttps://everpresent.com/",

Some time ago, I had purchased a DVD recorder for the sake of preserving the videos, but it was a time consuming process, and I stopped after a few videos were burned to DVD.\n\nNow, though, I'm really wanting to digitize them before time runs out. I have a couple of old 8mm players and a capture card, and my initial attempts have been successful. However, I'm trying to decide what the best storage medium would be.\n\nI'd love to digitize them all, and upload them to a private YouTube channel to share with my family. However, I have no idea how much storage space I will need, nor the capacity of saving them to YouTube.\n\nAnyone have any idea how much storage space I may need for each hour of video converted?",

On most of them the quality is **perfectly** fine, and even the ones that have minor issues are completely watchable. We're talking about tapes from the mid 80's here, with absolutely no signs of degradation. Oh and a lot of these tapes were from movie rental stores so they've been watched about a billion times, still holding up fine.\n\nPeople vastly overstate how much VHS tapes degrade, a lot of people act like the signal just completely fades away on old tapes. The bigger issue with VHS storage is mold, but thankfully that's also very rare (as long as you don't let the tapes get wet/damp)\n\nSo go out to some thrift stores and start hunting for VHS tapes, you won't regret it. Especially since you can pick them up for very cheap or even free. Cheers :)\n\noh, and shoutout to r/VHS",

The albums comprise recordings of tape loops that gradually deteriorated each time they passed the tape head, the unexpected result of Basinski's attempt to transfer his earlier recordings to digital format. The completion of the recording coincided with the 9/11 attacks, which Basinski witnessed from his rooftop in Brooklyn; the artwork features Basinski's footage of the New York City skyline in the aftermath of the World Trade Center's collapse.

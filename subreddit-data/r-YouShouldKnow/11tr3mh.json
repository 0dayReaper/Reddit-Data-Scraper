Last year I asked my bank to disable overdraft, thinking it would just decline any transaction that goes over and that's it. Turns out they charge 20 bucks for each transaction",

I\u2019ve been in the industry almost 8 years.\n\nOverdrafting is an industry standard, regardless of whether its a credit union or a bank.\n\nPeople should bank with credit unions because the interest rates tend to be much better, credit unions are not-for-profit which means they make decisions for the members and not shareholders, and many credit unions are part of a co-op of credit unions. That means you can go anywhere in the US and find a credit union in the co-op and use them to make withdrawals/deposits and several other services.\n\nYes, there do tend to be less fees for things BUT overdraft fees are just as prevalent.",

Overdraft protection will pull funds from a different account before allowing your account to overdraft. This may cause you to incur a fee, but that fee is typically less than the fee for actually overdrafting on your account.\n\nEither way, the real pro tip is to be aware of the fees your bank charges and know how to avoid them.",

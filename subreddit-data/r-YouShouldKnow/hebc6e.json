For example, Japanese children are taught to look at others' necks to avoid making direct eye contact.\n\nConsider that not all behaviors considered \"rude\" are intended to be, or even universally considered rude. This is especially important to remember if you are a parent, teacher, boss, or other authority figure.\n\nEdit: Would also like to add people with eye and hearing problems too!",

I noticed she was making unbreakable eye contact when she was arguing with me as to why we can't replace her phone. It felt like she was trying to assume control to get her way. Normally I look slightly away when I conversate but as she continued to gaze and complain I stood my ground and stared right back. There was this 2 second pause where we stared at each other which felt like hours. Shortly after she left without making a bigger fuss. It certainly was a surreal experience for me as my anxiety was rising but I knew i had to stand my ground.",

In normal everyday conversations eye contact and body language all say I'm listening but I'm somewhere else completely. Yet, hard conversations where I need to listen and focus I tend to look away or cover my face. For people that know me even those that know I have ADHD they often think I'm not listening or care about what they're saying cause they see me make eye contact and nod politely during unimportant conversations. It's really hard to explain. I'll make eye contact and provide all the vocal/body cues you would expect from a very \"polite\" person while a sales men pitches a 4 year protection plan; I'll hear next to nothing but it looks like I care. Conversely, if my SO wants to talk about her day I staring at a wall with resting bitch face while fidgeting the whole time.",

On top of people seeing you as somewhat incompetent they also see you as unwilling to work on it because you have explained away any responsibility you have towards your actions by claiming ADHD. I generally keep it's myself for that reason and also I don't want people thinking that about me if they don't understand it because generally what happens is they'll try to factor that unknown quality about you into their interactions with you.",

Then when it's feeing unnatural/uncomfortable to hold their gaze you can just like look away and use hand gestures and express verbal exasperations to show you're listening. \n\nOk that might make no sense but like say your friend is venting about some dumbass coworker doing a dumbass thing, you can turn away and make an \"Arghhh\" sound and have your palms facing upwards in an aggravated claw gesture. Or putting your face in your palms to show you understand the other persons frustrations and are \"feeling it\". \n\nFuck this is so hard to explain \n\nBut like basically as long as you can make a verbal/physical reaction that shows you're listening/empathizing with the other persons story, you don't have to make constant eye contact.",

Or throwing in little comments about a small detail of their story/point/ect\n\nI have also noticed that it's way easier to hold a conversation and actually remembering the conversation if I'm busy doing physical tasks.

The physical distraction seems to help my mind focus on the words way easier. \n\nBut standing there face to face while my manager talks to me and I couldn't tell u more than maybe the very very vague basics of what we talked about.",

I can tell stuff like social cues and the like perfectly normally, it's only really eye contact thats a problem for me. I guess I'm somewhat anxious about meeting new people aswell.\n\nHonestly I'm still not 100% sure on the diagnosis as I was a very young child at the time and was far more shy than I am now. I barely even answered half the questions at the time as I was so shy and had no idea what to say. A lot of the stuff they asked was about inventing stories and scenarios which I was honestly just too embarrassed to even try to do at the time. I'm in my 20s now. Also I'm from the UK, so it was of course all free of charge with the NHS.\n\nI occasionally will get anxious when somebody is staring and I can clearly tell out of the corner of my eye that they are trying to make eye contact as I'm aware that I'm kind of expected to return it.\n\nAlthough I don't really hold conversations with people outside my circle anyway so it's not a huge issue for me. Eye contact isn't exactly expected when buying something at a shop or ordering a meal, etc (although there hasn't been much of that recently of course).",

Having them publicly confront me and call me rude when I\u2019m more involved in the discussion than most, just because I don\u2019t always make eye contact.  Being lectured about that like a child with poor manners is enough to make me stare someone down while I let them know how presumptuous and rude they themselves are being.\n\nI had a friend do this in the middle of an otherwise great conversation in a public place.  Suddenly the whole conversation turned into a discussion about how I could do things differently, and I got so mad.  I spent about 5 minutes explaining to him that it gives me anxiety to do that, and that I won\u2019t pretend to understand why, and he shouldn\u2019t either.  Afterward, he says \u201cHey, guess what you\u2019re doing?  Making eye contact.\u201d  I said \u201cYeah... want to know why?  Because I\u2019m offended.\u201d",

Sometimes it's anxiety, in rare instances it causes them pain, but a lot of kids with autism just don't understand the value in it. It's a social rule they don't get the concept or the meaning of it.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Netflix is beginning to crack down on password sharing, so if you plan on canceling, you can replace it with a free library services instead. \n\n[Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/) and [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/) are the most common streaming video services offered by libraries. Both services allow you to stream TV and films for free, with a limit of x per month (depends on the library) and are integrated with most smart devices/TVs. \n\nYou\u2019d be surprised at the catalog, too. Most free streaming services offer subpar titles. However, Kanopy offers movies like Moonlight, Lady Bird, 8th Grade, The Big Short, etc. They also have a huge collection of Oscar nominees/winners, world cinema, and classics. \n\nHoopla has The Magic School Bus. Need I say more?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a library card, check your local library\u2019s website to see if they offer a way to get a digital card. Many libraries limit card availability by county, but some give access to state residents.\n\nEdit: typos",

Some of those countries could only have 1 or 2 libraries that offer them. All three companies are based in the US, so I think the majority of their participating libraries are in North America.",

Hell, my disability check doesn\u2019t even cover all of my rent. I am nowhere near high class nor wealthy (no generational wealth either). Try returning the book on time.\n\nOr, try advocating for doing what my library system recently did, which is abolishing late fees. The only way you get charged anything, is if you straight up lose a book. And even then, nothing ever gets sent to collections so even if you were to lose one, it wouldn\u2019t (financially) mess you up in any way. They even tossed out all existing late fees when they started this.\n\nBut even without a library system that abolished fees like mine, as long as you return the book on time there won\u2019t be any fees to worry about.",

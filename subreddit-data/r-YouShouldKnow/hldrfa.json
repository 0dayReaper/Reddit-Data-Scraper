    "postText": "I'm a teacher. Every year, I get at least one parent who tells me that they just expect their kids to do their chores, and they won't ever say \"thank you\" for doing them. Then these parents wonder why their kids fight them on chores. \n\nThese same parents often tell me they don't understand why their kids put so much effort into my class. \n\nIt's really very easy. I thank them for their answers in class. I thank them for helping their classmates. I thank them for picking up after a lab. I thank them when they give their presentations. \n\nEvery opportunity I have to do it, I say \"thank you.\" \n\nMy mom always gave me an enthusiastic \"thank you!\" when my sister and I did chores. As a result, we always did them, often without being asked. We said \"thank you\" when she made dinner. \n\nA home culture of saying \"thank you\" is a very easy and effective way to improve adult/teen relationships, and you'll have happier teens too.\n\nEdit: it's after 10pm here, and I'm off to sleep. Thank you for all your comments and the award. You guys are awesome.\n\nEdit: Well, RIP my inbox! I can't reply to all of you, but thank you so much for commenting and thank you to everyone who gave me an award! This is my most popular post ever, and I've loved seeing some of the other perspectives. \n\nYou're all amazing, and thank you so much!",

Then after my rant, she quietly told me what she actually said and I appologized sincerely, told her I needed to put myself in check and I shouldn't have reacted. I got an \"it's okay mommy, we all make mistakes\" . My mom would've just blown it off and changed the subject.",

It's so hard learning to speak up for yourself when your parents just yell saying \"no excuses\" when you aren't even in the wrong. Yes the world isn't fair, but don't intentionally make the one place they're supposed to feel safe that way too.\n\nJust to add: I also agree with OP about saying thank you, to your kids, and maybe adding a please when you first ask instead of demanding. I know it's really hard to break the cycle of \"well that's how I was raised\" and I struggle myself but it's worth putting the work in.",

My parents never once thanked us and we hated chores, but I always find myself thanking my daughter for doing things around the house and she\u2019s always super exited to help out. I mean, she begged to do the dishes today?? I was going to do them and this cute little 6 year old pulled up her stool and told me \u201cno I\u2019m doing them today!\u201d Granted it was just the breakfast dishes so two bowls a couple cups and a plate, but I was so appreciative and she was so proud when she finished. Man I love this kid.",

As a kid I asked her (politely) why she never thanked me (we were taught in school it was good manners) and she angrily told me children should never be thanked for doing things they were supposed to be doing anyway. It took the heart right out of me. I don't have kids but I made sure to never make her mistake with other people. Unsurprisingly, I have much better relationships.",

It's so important for children to have a healthy concept of social interaction. I absolutely hated being told \"You'll understand or change your mind when you're older\" as a kid/teenager. Hell, I'm 22 now and I still get pretty upset by it. I will listen to an experience-based argument when presented non-condescendingly, but some people are so transparent in using age as a way to invalidate anyone they don't want to listen to because they don't have any actual points behind their beliefs.\n\nAnd when I find myself thinking that my age/experience contributes to my position on something when talking to someone younger to me, I either just don't use that part of the argument because of how infuriating it is for me to hear, or if necessary admit that the majority of my position is based on age/time and ask if that's alright. Younger people can't relate to or draw from a worldview they haven't experienced, yknow?",

Turns out he'd tell them to do something instead of asking and never thanked them for anything or complimented a job well done. It's a small difference but phrasing it as \"Can you get a line sweep?\" instead of \"Sweep the line\" and a simple \"Thank you\" goes a long way. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nWhen I was a line cook there one of the managers at the time took me under his wing and helped me learn what I needed to get to a management position after I told him I was interested in it. He also taught me the 'compliment sandwich.' You lead with something they do/did well, offer constructive criticism, and then finish with reinforcement of a positive thing.

I had a serious problem with being made to do anything when I didn\u2019t want to, but my own mother gave me the respect to choose when to do it. \n\nShe framed it as \u201cthis needs to be done. You don\u2019t have to do it now, or even tomorrow, but I would appreciate if it was done by the end of the week.\u201d And then she wouldn\u2019t bring it up again. If I didn\u2019t do it by the end of the week, then we\u2019d have a talk about why I didn\u2019t do it, and then she would get me started by \u201chelping\u201d me by bringing in the vacuum to my room, or setting out the cleaning stuff on my bed. \n\nIt really depends on your relationship- I was fortunately raised with mutual respect between my parents, and while being told when to do something made me not want to do it at all, I had a great relationship with my parents that I would listen to them in the end without putting up a fuss. \n\nHope that may bring some perspective or some thought!",

Cleaning your whole room is a really big task for a kid, and it's hard for them to know how to even begin, especially since they are inexperienced and may have other life complications going on (school stress, insomnia, bullying, who knows). \n\nInstead, I would consider breaking it down into individual small steps (like putting his clean clothes away, picking up his dirty clothes, or making his bed). Ask for each of them separately, and praise him for completing each of them separately. Just make it something he can *definitely* achieve without a lot of difficulty. As time goes on and the work gets more comfortable and automatic, you can ramp up your expectations. If he exceeds your expectations, definitely praise him extra!",

The straw that broke the camel's back was her laughing that I was getting stressed out over a crush and I just remember bawling and saying \"do my feelings not count just because I'm young?\" In hindsight of course it *was* a silly crush and didn't matter in the long run, but at the time I was having a tough go of it and I was feeling stressed out and sad.\n\nAnd she actually listened and changed after that. Looking back it's honestly shocking and I was *so* fortunate to have good parents. A lot of people would have gotten defensive and just continued ignoring me or belittling me, but she listened apologized and changed.\n\nI almost credit that single moment with saving our whole relationship.",

The people closest to us can hurt us so much with such casual statements. \n\nHave you spoken with your spouse about the deflation? Sometimes my fiance will do or say something which hurts, and when I speak to him about it later his narrative is so wildly different from my own, that he was confused about why I would be upset with him at all! \n\nFor example, sometimes my love gets anxious about the days tasks, especially in the mornings. Well if I've just wrapped up telling him about an interesting story, and he's got 30 million things he's thinking about, his immediate response to me isn't about the story, but rather, \"we have a lot to do today, let's get moving\". \n\nIt's taken some time, but I've been able to learn that if I can manage not to get emotional about feeling like my story is ignored, I can say -right then- \"hey, I know you're thinking of a lot but I still need to feel heard by you.\" And he will usually go, \"oh shit, whoops. That was hilarious, a lady threw a stuffed squirrel at you?\" Or whatever. \n\nHowever, if I sit on my frustrations, then later say \"I felt unheard this morning,\" my husband to be will get frustrated with me! Because in his mind, he heard the story, and now he's moving on to the next big thing.\n\nAnyways, try chatting with your own husband about how his laundry folding comment isn't inappropriate, but it would come off much more loving if first he said, \"that dusting and bathroom work was tedious and I didn't want to do it either. Thanks for rising to the challenge, I love you. By the way, are you going to fold the laundry or should I plan to do that today?\" \n\nThanks for being a teacher. It's often thankless work, and you are raising up our futures bravely and with kindness.",

I was complaining to my boyfriend that i hadnt been home alone for so many days, i hadn't had a chance to clean. \n\nHe asked why that mattered, i said i feel judged and mocken when clening in front of people. He was like, yea..... thats not normal. \n\nRelfecting back, my parents would always make comments like \"look whos finally doing something\" or if id cleaned the whole house but not done the dishes, i would be yelled at horrendously and get no Thankyou for the rest of the stuff i had done. \n\nI still havent found a solution, but knowing its not normal has lead to some new perspective.",

I hated chores &amp; growing up as the oldest of 5 (now 7) kids, there were a LOT of chores to do.\n\nAlso when I was in a rehab/girl's group home for a YEAR, I came home and my father &amp; his wife had left all dishes and laundry for me...from the whole year. They just kept buying and stacking things up. I had to wash them the day after I got home. It's super fucked with my ability to do simple chores around my own home but I also feel like garbage if there's even a small mess.",

From very early age, kids should be included in chores as form of group activity at home. So that when they grow up don't view the chores as punishments for low grades or some other failings. They have to be encouraged to do chores and let them take ownership for it. They may not do them correctly the first few times but eventually they will learn. Putting them down for slight mistakes is a big turn off for kids.",

Other educators are always shocked at how well our room runs. \n\nI got cross at one of the children the other week and immediately felt like shit for it, because it was over a silly little thing and she didn\u2019t understand. I took a few minutes to calm down, took the child aside, apologised for getting angry and explained what had made me angry and why I shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way, then asked for a cuddle.

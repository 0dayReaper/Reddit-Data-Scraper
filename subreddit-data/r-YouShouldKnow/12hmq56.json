    "postText": " Why YSK: Wearing clothes immediately after applying roll-on deo results to the compound clinging on to the clothes, thus becoming a base for bacteria to grow into and further creating yellow streaks/stains. Allowing it to fully dry is the most crucial part many people miss. This step also prolongs the shelf life of your clothes and saves you lots (monetarily and shame-wise) in the long run.",

With deodorant with non, after a short time, my armpits get extremely dry/scratchy feeling (even though they are wet or damp with sweat). \n\nSo I would have to put more deodorant on or some lotion. I noticed my skin would get raw, and dry skin with peeling and pain, and I'd have to use lotion and nothing for a day or two to get my skin to heal. \n\n\nBy 6-8 hours I always have raw feeling armpits. Also, even after a year of little to no anti perspirant I would get strong BO by night.  Didn't seem to matter what kind I used, it just wasn't effective, and drove my skin nuts. \n\n\nTried several brands and committed a whole year. Just today I opened a new anti perspirant and we'll see if life gets easier again.",

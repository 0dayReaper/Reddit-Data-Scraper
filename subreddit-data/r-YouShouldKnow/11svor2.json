            "comment": "First off, the short term opioids for a procedure are not going to be enough to cause addiction. Second, the current direction is that opioids aren't given for medical procedures very often any more. Third, you can just not take them and take an NSAID like Naproxen or Ibuprofen if that works well enough (not Tylenol, too much of that will kill your liver).",

It's not habit forming when there's pain! The article was about how harmful the opioid epidemic is for pain patients and how they pretty much just give out Tylenol now.",

A quick google search will show you some options (ablation, stem cell, etc), and show you that opiates are not recommended for any of the issues you shared. \n\nWhile opiates were useful in the civil war era, their unbelievably high rate of addiction has made them very outdated medically today,  You might consider seeing a Dr that uses more modern treatments for your ailments, ones that will not create a physical / psychological dependence.  \n\nThat being said, 15 years of opiate use would be painfully hard to kick.  \n\nPain sucks, but pain + addiction sucks more.",

Given the current climate regarding narcotic pharmaceuticals, DEA laws, and addiction awareness, if the doctor is writing narcotic pain meds, it's because there is a need. \n\nPeople have really forgotten HOW we got here, haven't they? Pharmaceutical companies (particularly the makers of OxyContin) knowingly LIED about the risks of addiction of their product. They paid docs, gave kickbacks/benefits to those who did. They lobbied, and were even able to have pain changed to become a vital sign, along with the standard ones. Doctors then wrote prescriptions, based on the info the companies/FDA had produced, not knowing it wasn't true. Most addicts started with a doctors prescription, but not a short term post-procedure Rx for a week's worth of meds. The other major contributor were doctors, who chose to put profits over their oaths, and worked or created pill mills.\n\nEDIT- we are in danger of the pendulum swinging to the opposite extreme, where patients are left to suffer. Dont allow the corporations that created this public health crisis to shirk responsibility and influence the response by pushing narratives where their lies are left out will do nothing to find a solution",

At least I assume it's all of them, but I have only ever taken codeine, and vicodin. \n\n\nWithout prescription anti-nausea meds, it only takes a very small dose of codeine (OTC in Canada) to make me vomit for a good 24 hours. When I was 17, I had anti-nausea meds with vicodin after wisdom teeth removal, and it knocked me out for about 12 hours a dose. After a weekend, and 2.5 doses of vicodin, I suffered physical withdrawal. I called the nurse line on that Monday frantic, because I was sure it was an infection that was causing the pain, nausea, body aches, headache, shaking, hot and cold flashes, and all the sweating. Nope. Opiate withdrawal. Apparently my mother can't take it either. Decades later, I told my own children's pediatrician, and she suggested it's some blood enzyme we don't have. That's unconfirmed though.\n\n\nSo people can have intolerances unrelated to overuse and addiction. I hate vomiting, and never want to have to go through withdrawal again, so I avoid opiates at all cost. Unfortunately, I was in a position to need pain meds when I had an ovarian cyst rupture, but nothing really touched it. Still didn't want the opiates. \n\nOn the plus side, my pain is taken seriously when I need medical care and I tell them at the jump that I can't take and do not want \"the good stuff.\"",

There are other options too that are safer and better than opioids, usually combine 1 or 2 NSAID with pregabaline, steroids, colchicine, depending on each individual case. So the most used painkiller after surgery currently is dexketoprofen (75mg iv) or ketorolac 30mg sublingual, and often 100mg iv infusion of tramadol (single dose of opioids) and most major after surgery pain it's under control, if the patient is still in pain there are other options as lidocaine patch or actual nerve blockages.

            "comment": "This is a great topic.  There are lots of data out there currently about alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and the ability of that combination to give pain relief effects similar to opiates.  Care must be taken to ensure that total acetaminophen doses do not exceed 3g, and this medication is NOT WEIGHT BASED.  Of course, all medical advice should be taken from your personal doctor and not a doctor posting on the internet.  I've attached some literature for those interesting in reading more.  And effectiveness will depend on level of surgery performed.\n\nAnecdotally I've used alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen for simple knee scopes and shoulder scopes with very good success.  Again, ask your own doctor if it's an option for you.\n\n https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=acetaminophen%20ibuprofen%20combination%20vs%20opiates&amp;filter=datesearch.y\\_10",

First session was when it was still common to prescribe Vicodin. I took two in the first couple of days and managed with ibuprofin otherwise.\n\nSecond round was after the crackdown. I was told to take ibuprofin and tylenol, and while it was tolerable during the day, I was in too much pain to sleep at night. I didn't get any rest the first night, and was bracing myself for a few more sleepless nights until I remembered I still had some ancient vicodin from the first procedure. \n\nTylenol and Ibuprofin are not always adequate.",

            "comment": "Over 80% of drug addiction is caused by accidental prescription addiction.  Society treats addicts like they're garbage, but most of them were simply doing what their doctor told them to do, and when the doctor took them off the medication, they go through heavy withdrawals and if they manage to throw away their pride and ask for help, they are shunned.  My wife has been on an opiate BLOCKER for over a decade.  It is an opiate, but it also blocks opiates and a long time user literally can't get high off it since it blocks all your receptors, so once your threshold equals the max dose, it can't make you feel good, only get rid of the withdrawals.  It is also impossible to get high off another drug while this drug in in your system.  So my wife is someone who is literally physically incapable of getting high on opiates.  We get treated like scum of the earth when we go to the pharmacy.  I've had to leave two pharmacies and switch to more expensive pharmacies because of how badly we are treated.  They will find any reason whatsoever, even make up reasons that hold no weight, to deny her the medication.  She was regularly having to tell them to call her doctor and he would yell at them for wasting his time and denying medication to a patient that was prescribed by a doctor.  Next time you suspect someone is an addict, please keep in mind that they are probably just a normal, reasonable person who needed surgery one time and got addicted to their pain medication while doing exactly what they were told to do.",

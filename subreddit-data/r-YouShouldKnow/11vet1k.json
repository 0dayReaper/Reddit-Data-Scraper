    "postText": "Why YSK: If you are planning to buy a ring, especially for a big occasion like  engagement, communion, graduation, etc. You should allow about 6 weeks to have a ring made. \n\nMost fine jewelry stores don't have the space to have every ring in every size, so they keep one of each ring in one size on hand. If your ring size is close enough to whatever size they have on hand, you can resize it (which usually takes a few weeks).  But if your size is not close enough, you will probably have to order a ring to be specially made for you. \n\nSource: I work in a major fine jewelry store. We have LOTS of people come in needing a ring in 3 days time or the next day, and we cant do anything for them.",

I'm a goldsmith, and unless there's a large workload a decent smith can absolutely have your ring ready within a day or two. If you're waiting weeks for a sizing job then your ring is likely being made to order, the goldsmiths have a large workload, or you've gone to a large corporate store that does mass production",

They do high quality work and know me even though I\u2019m not a super user customer.   I\u2019ve never gotten the personal experience I\u2019ve from them from a big name national shop.  Would highly recommend smaller places with goldsmiths.  They can really fine tune and help you understand the good/bad and figure out what you want (or don\u2019t.)",

My moms ex-husband was a jeweller and had a problem trying to convince all the franchise jewellery stores to hire actual goldsmiths in store; like they used to. \n\nBut because big greedy corporations obviously desire cost cutting; no jewellery store has actual jewellers anymore. They\u2019re just retail staff. \n\nYou want something done? They get it done at the factory where every single jeweller in the region works. They post your item there and you\u2019ll get it back in 4-6 weeks. Maybe. \n\nHe hated it. And he was right. It\u2019s dumb.",

I took it to the store I bought it from (zales), because I had the warranty that is suppose to cover repairs. They sent it to be repaired, and came back saying they couldn't repair it.\n\nSince it's special to me, I want to try to get it repaired, even if it invalidates the warranty and I have to pay all the current and future costs. So my question is, should I go to a jeweler or a goldsmith? The band is what broke, right under/next to the rose head on the top. [This is the ring.](https://www.zales.com/enchanted-disney-belle-110-ct-tw-diamond-rose-ring-10k-rose-gold/p/V-20108948). Do you think I'd be able to find someone that can fix it? Or should I just accept what the store clerk said that it can't be fixed? Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",

The finger size would be measured. Because he could saw som part out or add to it the ring (depending on how busy they were and potential additional cost.) the ring could be done in one or a couple of days.\n\nSo indeed they only have limited ring sizes but this I believe is mostly because they have always been made to size (fine jewelery.). It used to be that the jeweler was a goldsmith or had one working for them very close by. But with mass production that changed.",

            "comment": "I own an independent jewelry store, and some of these comments in here are pretty wild. In general, most jewelry stores don't stock every size because the cost of inventory wouldn't be practical. I could stock one ring in 5 sizes, or I could stock 5 different rings with the same amount on money.  As far as sizing goes, it depends on the ring. I could safely size a solitaire from a stock 7 to a 3.75 no problem. Probably half of my inventory could be sized that small. Certain rings with micro pave set or channel set stones would cause more trouble. If you have time, it's better to  build the ring in your size. Most ring sizing can be done in 30 minutes to an hour by an experienced jeweler. Some rings take longer, and some take less. If you're waiting a couple of days, it's typically because the jeweler has several customers in front of you. If you're waiting a couple of weeks, it's typically because that store doesn't have a jeweler on site, and they're mailing your ring somewhere. I can design and build a ring from scratch faster and usually cheaper than a chain store can have one sized. Your experience will vary depending on where you shop.",

The wedding band was made so the engagement ring fits inside of it making it look like one ring. It's really nice, I was shocked at the price and was mad I didn't go to Jewelers row for the engagement ring, but logistically it was not possible as I had my wife's best friend doing much of the leg work on the style of the ring.

In the UK there's also TJC which is alright and might also exist in the US (avoid Gemporia as its junk these days). \n\nIndependent jewellery stores are also good if a tad more expensive as long as they have a gold / silversmith, but would avoid any of the chain stores fullstop at least in the UK. Only semi decent one seems to be Goldsmiths as they often employ someone on site. If desperate time wise and in the UK, try the Birmingham Jewellery quarter (prob equivalent in other countries esp cities). \n\nCan never understand why it takes weeks to get stuff unless they have to be shipped from India where a lot of it is made.",

Do NOT get wedding rings made of silver, or that are simply \u201cgold plated\u201d unless you have the intention of replacing/upgrading them fairly soon. Same with stones that are not diamonds-if there is a different gemstone, look up that type of stone on the Mohs hardness scale. The lower the score the more likely that stone is going to get chipped or cracked and need replacing.  I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t get a ring with an opal for example but if you\u2019re doing so as a wedding or engagement, ring, knows that you will need to replace the stone pretty often and that the ring shouldn\u2019t be worn in the shower, pool, doing dishes, etc.\n\nUnlike other jewelry, wedding and engagement rings are worn every day and should be made of materials that will stand the test of time while taking a beating",

I don't actually know the location of our jeweler, or all the inner workings, so I can't give a great reason as to why it takes a whole two weeks, but I think all our shops across the continent use the same jewelers (not sure on that either tbh) so I imagine they have a LOT of repairs, resizing, etc from all the shops, whereas a local jeweler wouldn't necessarily have that problem.",

I told them when it was (and so when I would need the ring by obviously) and after I picked out the rock and the type of ring they told me it would be done, at the earliest, on X date. The problem was, X date was 2 weeks after our trip. Their solution was, \"take this other ring and propose with it and then when you get back we'll exchange for the one you ordered.\" I was like, who TF wants to propose with the wrong ring and switch it out. I was so livid with them that I chewed them out and walked out.",

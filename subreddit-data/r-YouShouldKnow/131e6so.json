And then I stumbled across the Asher Fergusson LGBTQ+ Travel Safety Index and discovered my destination is ranked safer than my (North American) home country. This type of index will undoubtedly help LGBTQ+ individuals stay safe while traveling, considering homosexuality is still criminalized in 64 countries.",

It states: \n\n&gt; *One country might surprise you for not ranking higher on our list: the United States. One reason for that is, of course, that there is a great deal of variation in gay rights depending on the\u00a0state you\u2019re in. There are also\u00a0no constitutional or broad protections\u00a0for LGBTQ+ rights under federal law in the U.S. Also, in some states, LGBTQ+ youth do not have access to helpful information, with these so-called\u00a0\u201cno-promo homo\u201d laws\u00a0counting in the \u201cpropaganda/morality\u201d category. The U.S. might have come far, but it has a long way to go in terms of LGBTQ+ rights,\u00a0especially for young transgender people.*\n\nAnd in terms of how tolerable it is even in the best states, I have a trans friend in California and he gets shit on constantly by peers, classmates, and adults for being trans. Not really related to the law, but he definitely doesn't feel safe there. If California is one of those \"top of the world areas,\" my city must be gay heaven",

It also seems to focus much more on long-term life than travel, contrary to what the title implies.\n\n\nAt least for Japan, the info is wrong/misleading too. I\u2019m living in Japan as a trans woman right now and I think it\u2019s very important to distinguish some things that are not in the index. For one, the index says that gender-change is legally recognized but requires a sex-change operation. This is true for native Japanese citizens trying to change their legal sex, but for foreign folk such as myself existing legal documents are fully recognized. My legal sex in Japan is female for ALL purposes, because that\u2019s what it says on my US passport.\n\n\nThere are other examples too, but this is just the one that stood out to me.",

For example, although Canada, and the US to a lesser extent, may have more legal protections, there's large swaths of each filled with retrograde, violent bigots; whereas although there's little legal protection in Japan, travellers shouldn't run up against much trouble.",

And I'm not equivalent being in a gang to being transgender.",

It\u2019s nigh-impossible to really explain to a non-trans person unless they\u2019ve experienced some other similar issue.\n\n\nThat discomfort you describe about wearing a dress for the day is a similar vibe, but it\u2019s more about how that feeling compounds with everything else to feel way worse than any of the things individually. \n\n\nIt\u2019s your voice being too low, your shoulders being too wide, your jaw being too square, your feet being too big, your arms and legs and chest being too hairy, it\u2019s everything all at once. If even one thing becomes uncomfortable for whatever reason, it brings everything else into the spotlight too and just spirals out of control.",

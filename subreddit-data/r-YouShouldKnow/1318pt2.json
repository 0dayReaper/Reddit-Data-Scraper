    "postText": "Why YSK: sewage systems in essentially any area can't handle them and they eventually cause big problems.  The wipes don't break down in water which causes a risk of clogging your home plumbing or causing damage to sewer infrastructure.  The real damage comes when a bunch of them wad together.  It's super lame that these companies get to keep callling them \"flushable wipes\"\n\nEdited: to take out repetitive sentence",

They even make people sign something when buying a house saying they know these aren't really flushable and they won't flush them. But they flush them anyway, clog their plumbing, and say their plumbing is defective. Builder sends a plumber who pulls out a wad of these things, takes pics to prove it, and hands them a massive bill. Warranty claim denied. It happens every single day.",

This comment made me giggle longer than it probably should have.\n\nI LOVE the idea of \"big plumbing\" being a real thing.\n\nBut in truth, it's the manufacturers of the wipes that create the organizations that create the \"self-governed\"  standards that allow these products to be labeled \"flushable.\"\n\nHere is just one example of such a setup. The Personal Care Products Coucil\n\n[governing board member list](https://www.personalcarecouncil.org/about-us/member-companies/#:~:text=Active%20members%3A%20Manufacturers%20and%2For,well%20as%20consumer%20and%20trade)\n\nThere's been a growing movement in the past 4 years or so to force manufacturers to stop using such nonsense labeling practices and, in fact, force manufacturers to label these as *non-flushable* wipes.\n\nBut those entities are typically local or sometimes even state governments tired of the added expense and strain these products create in the water treatment systems.",

As in, there was no proof of no clogs before the implementation, so they couldn't be blamed for the clogs now. Again, the people with money win...\n\nWe do use flushable wipes, but we don't flush them. They go in the trash along with my feminine care items. My husband has UC, and sometimes I just like to feel fresh. Yes, we need to try a bidet, we're working on it.",

From what i've read, it's due to their conducting market research which indicates users are not following directions and flushing handfuls of wipes at a time, which isn't how they're intended to be used. Suffice to say these can be flushed safely, just don't flush a handful at a time.\n\nFundamentally, consumers are going to continue flushing wipes, regardless and so continued product development and  certification is important. Yorkshire Water's new stance is frankly myopic.",

In the United States a flushable wipe is put through several tests including what's called the slosh box (it's basically a box filled with water that moves back and forth agitating the water with the wipes in it.)   In the United States a flushable wipe must begin breaking down within 8 minutes of being in the slosh box which mimics being in a septic or sewer system. Most of the major first world country manufacturers actually have more strict slosh box tests in which the material begins to break down in 6 minutes.\n\nThe problem is this... There are a tremendous amount of wipes manufactured in countries like China and Turkey which label themselves as flushable and are not flushable.\n\nAlso when wipes first came out many people confused baby wipes and even adult wipes as flushable which they are not unless specifically marked as flushable.\n\nNow really don't hate me when I say the next thing, the massive issues caused in countries like the UK and Australia where they had tremendous blockages of wipes that were not breaking down were the result of people flushing non-flushable wipes or wipes bought from China marked as flushable.\n\nIf the wipes are manufactured in the US, Italy, Spain or Finland, and marked as flushable, they are legitimately flushable wipes. You could test this yourself at home by filling a sink with water, throwing a wipe in swirling it around for a few minutes and watching to see if it begins to fall apart within 6-8 minutes.\n\nCompanies like P&amp;G, Costco and Target are not putting their names on flushable wipes when they aren't really flushable..",

Municipalities and cities run to the assumption that it is flushable wipes that have not truly broken down, the answer is you have people who have flushed non-flushable wipes because they normally have no clue what the consequences would be, or they purchased less expensive wipes which were probably manufactured in China marked as flushable and truly aren't. If you're not in the industry directly it's an easy assumption, the only reason why I know is because I work directly for one of these manufacturing companies that produced wipes for distribution and labeling by other companies which is standard industry practice. People in wastewater management are simply pulling up gobs of wipes which have been flushed and they are correctly saying the clog are wipes that are not disintegrating, they are incorrectly stating that flushable wipes are non-flushable. The best way would be to educate the public to say listen these brands of flushable wipes are flushable but not all wipes are flushable so please watch what you are putting into your toilets.\n\nThe different color material is a great idea! If you've ever seen Swiffer mops with the disposable mop head wipes, you've probably seen ones with a green, purple or brown stripe of material to use for scrubbing on different surfaces. The methodology exist today to do that, the challenge is every company wants their product to be a bit unique... It might be hard to get the entire industry to agree to one color, and these colors when used in the manufacturing process then require a complete shutdown and cleaning of the equipment before you go to run pure white wipes for  different applications such as a disinfecting surface wipe, this would add cost to the end product and we all know who pays the price when it comes to adding cost.",

They are neither fabric which is woven nor paper, the industry's group organization is called INDA and they spend a lot of time educating the public, working on the right marketing materials and how labels should be marked.\n\nThere are two major issues.... Foreign manufacturers who claim to be flushables, you'll find these at the lower end of the price points and a locations like dollar stores, and of course people want to pay cheapest for a disposable item like this so unknowingly they are buying wipes labeled as flushable which are not flushable... It's similar to buying organic food from the same countries, rarely is anything from China or Turkey actually organic. A company like P&amp;G is never going to market something as flushable when it's not, they would be the target of multiple lawsuits immediately so you know if you buy a Pampers flushable wipe it's flushable. Some Chinese manufacturer who's not based here could probably care less because of the red tape it would take for the US to fine a Chinese manufacturer.  The other problem is that people are not entirely educated about nor do the containers use a large enough font for people to understand whether something is flushable or not. If you look at most containers or flat packs of wipes You can't always tell with a quick look if it's flushable or not. Would you believe for many years personal hygiene wipes were actually non-flushable! Who in the right mind would think of wiping their tushy with something and then throw it into a trash can?\n\nTry the sink test You'll have a lot of fun with it!",

Somebody who's not in the industry such as wastewater management should not be saying flushable wipes are not flushable what they should be saying is don't flush something unless it's truly flushable, there remain today tons of brands of baby wipes and personal wipes which are non-flushable but you could barely read it on the package.

This simple regulation is the exact type of thing government is for.

The water had started to soak into the drywall at the bottom and spread up, making it so every wall in the hallways and every ground floor apartment had to be torn apart about 2 feet up the wall and replaced.\n\nThe smell was just incredibly hard to remove completely and was especially difficult for the people who had an extra-sensitive sense of smell.\n\nAll because of baby wipes.",

There were a few tenants who were buying these and flushing them and the pipes began having some serious issues. Since the building was going to renovate the bathrooms coming up, they figured replace the pipes when they renovated. The moving of people around to do the renovation was such a crap fest,that I can\u2019t wait to repeat it when they eventually do the kitchen. /s (on the bright side, at least the bathroom is new and looks very nice and I\u2019m hoping the same for the kitchen)",

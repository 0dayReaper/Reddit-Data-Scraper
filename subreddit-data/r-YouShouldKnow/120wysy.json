Infant botulism can cause muscle weakness, with signs like poor sucking, a weak cry, constipation, and decreased muscle tone (floppiness).\n\nhttps://kidshealth.org/en/parents/honey-botulism.html#:~:text=Babies%20younger%20than%201%20year,decreased%20muscle%20tone%20(floppiness).",

Their spores can survive extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) and adverse conditions, this allows the spores to survive cooking, freezing, and food preservation processes. \n\nSince babies have fledgling immune systems it\u2019s best to avoid any honey or products with honey. They\u2019re more likely to develop infant botulism if exposed to any residual spores. \n\nBacteria in this family create some of these most potent toxins known to man and should not be trifled with. (Toxin from Botulinum specifically has been purified and refined in labs to be used medically as things like botox. Tetani causes tetanus, and perfringens is the 3rd most common form of food poisoning in the US but can be killed if cooked over 165\u00b0f, however if any spores are present they can survive cooking processes and germinate as food sits overtime)",

When I researched it when my son was little, I found that babies under 6 months shouldn\u2019t be fed carrots due to the nitrates in them which messes with their red blood cells, and that feeding them too much can cause carotenemia. But 6+ months it\u2019s fine to offer carrots.\n\nAlso, although carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes carotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenosis, in which the skin becomes yellow. Maybe your professor just didn\u2019t explain it well?",

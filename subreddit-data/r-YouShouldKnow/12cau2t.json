    "postText": "Why YSK: The benefits of kindness extend far beyond simply being a nice gesture. Researchers have found that practicing kindness can improve cognitive function and overall brain health. By fostering social engagement, kindness can positively impact brain health. Additionally, teaching kindness can equip individuals with practical skills for managing stress and promoting healthy interactions. On a larger scale, kindness can promote prosocial behavior and create a more empathetic and supportive community.\n\nSource:  [The power of kindness](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/949471)",

Getting mad at them will only make me feel like shit. People are rude to me? It doesn't get to me as much as it used to. Staying true to yourself by putting some distance between you and others this way is amazing for your mental health, but it requires a bit of practice to improve your self-esteem",

View your behaviour from a logical standpoint: What good will it do being rude to some people? It won\u2018t release stress or anger the way one might hope, instead it fosters it and makes one even more angry or bitter. Instead, just being kind makes you feel better about yourself. It\u2018s completely okay to do kind things out of egotistical reasons such as feeling better about yourself, because what matters is not what you think of while doing it, but what the person on the receiving end gets. And if that is remotely a good or positive feeling, you\u2018ve already achieved the goal.\n\nAlso, if you do feel pressured, burnt out or something by that stuff, acknowledge that feeling and don\u2018t fight it, it\u2018ll only make it worse. Bathe in the feeling for a bit, i\u2018m pretty sure you\u2018ll feel much more at ease afterwards",

My therapist once told me that sometimes being kind means being honest and direct and sometimes that may hurt someone\u2019s feelings or upset them. It doesn\u2019t mean you intended to hurt their feelings or weren\u2019t being kind it was just an unintended consequence. In the long run, it\u2019s best for all involved. If you\u2019re burnt out by it, it probably means you\u2019re not setting and enforcing proper boundaries with people around certain scenarios. Once you set clear boundaries and stick to them, you should feel better and be able to preserve your energy. Anyone who continues to drain you and take your energy is most likely someone who doesn\u2019t respect you or your boundaries and you need to distance yourself from them.",

The size of these events are way less important than we usually think. We keep chasing the big happy, while we ignore the small happy. Practising gratitude for small things is a great tool that helps you on the way to a more stable mental health! \n\nYou're doing amazing by writing that journal. Remember, even the smallest moments of reflection are good enough. Just dont put too much pressure on yourself if keeping the journal up to date turns out to be difficult. Its better to do it once and stop after that than to not do it at all (this is the case for so many things, especially self-help tools that seem to disappear from your routine after a while).\n\nI hope you have a lovely day, it's what you deserve!",

At the end of each day (well, when I\u2019m actually actively using the diary), I write a few several short bullet points of things that made me smile today or things that made me feel appreciative or warm or happy.\n\nKeeping it short or one sentence\u2026 Or just a couple of words, and not writing a novel, is also an exercise in brevity for me because it\u2019s not one of my strong points. My ADHD brain likes to waffle on endlessly about things that excite me.\n\nI have found, that, by writing in this journal, my brain automatically now looks for positive things throughout the day that make me smile\u2026 So that, at the end of the day, I actually have something to write! \n\nLastly, I hope you also have a lovely day/week/month, etc!!",

Kindness is required for us to grow and develop as human beings, especially when we are young. It is also what gives us our positive inner drive/voice. \n\nOh, yours isn't positive? You aren't alone. There's a name for that too. It's the voice of your super ego, which had to develop before your ego because your environment required you to be more hyper vigilant -\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/how-to-deal-with-inner-critic/\n\nAnd it isn't impossible to beat. Part of it, though, requires growth and receiving kindness (since being kind to yourself is something you will need to learn).",

When your brain is developing and you are not in a safe environment, the super ego will develop before the ego- the part of you that is your logical, rational sense of self. You will become hyper vigilant to anything that can be wrong and learn to spot dangers very easily. So for those of us who have C-PTSD (as we weren't able to really develop our sense of self), this hyper vigilance remains into adulthood to shitty effect.\n\nAnother way I view it is that my \"super ego\"  is a product of my amygdala (defense center of the brain). When activated (aka \"triggered\") it can turn the prefrontal cortex completely offline. I view the prefrontal cortex as where my \"ego\" is :)  I also think of the inner critic as the voice of the super ego, it helps a lot while working through trauma processing.",

It's a lesser known concept that has other meanings attached to it outside of your intent.\n\nStructural dissociation describes it a little differently, and more accurately (in my opinion) - a form of 'extreme' compartmentalization where emotional parts of ourselves get divided from our 'functional' everyday part so we can still function and survive throughout the things we can't cope with.\n\nVarious emotional parts can still come forward to protect us and help us survive, which because of the trauma can happen from potentially nonthreating stimuli depending on what triggers those traumas.\n\nJanina Fisher's book, Healing the fragmented selves of trauma survivors is really good if it seems relevant to you.",

When I got to my seat there was a Brazilian couple who did not speak English that had already spread out to the entire row so I had to ask them to move to their own seats. Since I was flustered I was pretty fuming at them and got in my seat sweaty and angry. \n\nOn takeoff we had pretty much the worst turbulence I've ever experienced. The plane dipped to the left like 15\u00b0. I looked up and could see the wife was pretty scared. I've been learning Portuguese for a few years so I asked them if they were Brazilian and then said \"It's very windy outside right now\" \n\nThe man asked me \"Is this normal?\" and I said \"It's more or less normal...everything is ok\" they smiled at me and looked more relaxed. \n\nAfter that I felt very happy. It was so funny to me that I hated this couple until I did something nice for them and then I instantly felt better and had positive feelings towards them.\n\nNot exactly what you are talking about but definitely was an amazing moment for me realizing the power of your own kindness",

I assume it has to do with generational trauma and many people in Germamy will recognise it buy won't do anything about it.\n\nKindness is a form of social intention. Social intention is what makes us feel alive (not invisible). And I think burocratisation that replace spontaneous social interaction and kindness with rules and authority order, makes many Europeans, so well adapted to burocracy, so averse to spontaneity and social interaction to the point of becoming suspicious of it. So when Germans point of other's kindness as insecurity I believe they are projecting, because being attached to authority order and burocracia and averse to spontaneity and casual interaction with strangers is essentially a kind o a social phobia.",

Why do you think that? \nI was always brought up to be kind and think of others first and I agree, sure you may get taken for granted at times but you learn not to let that happen twice and those who do that are, I've found (from my perspective anyway) not overly happy in life.\nI think, why wouldn't you try to make someone a bit happier- it doesn't cost anything unless you want it to. A smile, comment or a chat to a stranger can be all it takes sometimes. I accept I'm a bit of a Polyanna at times despite everything that's gone on, but I really am at my happiest when others are happy and whenever an idea pops in to my head to do something and I instinctively feel/know- I just decide to follow that voice and do it!\nIt might be something small, like buy an extra coffee for someone at work or pay for some groceries for the person who's forgotten their card or spend time volunteering etc..",

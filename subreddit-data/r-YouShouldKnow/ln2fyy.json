    "postText": "Why YSK:\n\nTimes are tough, dudes, and we all need some help sometimes.  When you're in a place where you can't afford therapy, or need a little extra support between therapy appointments, mental health apps can help fill those gaps.\n\nNot all mental health apps are legit, though, and outside of the most popular paid apps (e.g. Headspace &amp; Calm), it can be hard to find something that's actually shown to be effective.\n\nThe VA has developed [a bunch of mental health apps](https://mobile.va.gov/appstore/mental-health) that are free to the general public.  Some were designed with veterans as the target audience, but some were designed to be used by anyone.\n\nSome highlights are:\n\n[Mindfulness Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/mindfulness-coach), which offers a self-guided mindfulness course and some recorded mindfulness exercises similar to what you can find on Headspace\n\n[Insomnia Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/insomnia-coach), which walks you through a treatment program for insomnia and has features like guided imagery recordings\n\n[MOVE Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/move-coach) which can help with weight loss and exercise in a guided program\n\n\\---\n\nIf you don't end up finding one you like through the VA, I highly recommend you check out [One Mind PsyberGuide](https://onemindpsyberguide.org/), which is a nonprofit site that has experts review mental health apps based on their credibility, effectiveness, and privacy settings.  There's some wonderful potential as far as apps go, but you don't want to waste your time on something that doesn't work or sells your private info.\n\nBe well, friends!\n\n[Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077722918300233?casa_token=NEDuA9Iwhh0AAAAA:7nW3jLvBvOVhFAlhZ8st2O3D0GPH7XEe1-etDVtZhLCjQ6ZelE7iAXIImj-FNCxkCNM88xsSDpPB)\n\n**Edit**:\n\nI wanted to update this to compile some of the excellent other resources people have mentioned in the comments.  Thank you so much to everyone who's making suggestions, this is becoming a really informative collection of info!  And thanks for the awards, it's very kind of you all.\n\nFirst of all, as u/ron-swonson shared, some public libraries are offering free subscriptions to some apps.  Go to your local library's site to see if they are offering anything!\n\nSome insurance companies are also offering free subscriptions like Kaiser Permanente-- thanks u/FrankU_MajorityHwip and u/lipstick_junkiej!\n\nSome of the most common suggestions are as follows.  I don't know much about many of these, but it's clear a lot of you have found them helpful.  (Sorry if I don't include your name or suggestion, there are a ton of comments to sift through!)\n\nInsight timer:  \"Tons of free guided meditation, meditation timer for your own sessions, groups, livestreams with meditation teachers, groups etc. \" - u/NugPacino\n\nWaking Up by Sam Harris: \"the most comprehensive, thoughtful, and exceptionally managed mediation app on the market, in my opinion\" u/tayezz\n\nBalance: \" also has a free year subscription!! I love their immersive meditations and Singles. I think they\u2019ll have an Android version out in March so everyone can get a free year. \" u/Alejandara\n\nWoebot: \" It runs through Facebook Messenger or as a separate app on your phone and guides you through cognitive behavioral therapy exercises. \" u/IffySaiso\n\nSmiling Mind: \"Smiling mind is amazing! Their sleep meditations help me nod off every single night now, and for those who need some background sounds to fall asleep to, the optional music on each meditation is perfect.\" u/Charlotte805\n\nMedito: \" Highly recommend Medito that has a pledge to keep their app free for all. \" u/mowpoos\n\nVirtual Hope Box: \" The Portland VA worked with The DOD on another one called [Virtual Hope Box](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/virtual-hope-box/id825099621) that was designed around suicide prevention.  My wife was pet of the study around efficacy, and I have used it myself. Great app and definitely should be included in this topic. \" u/omnithorpe\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Some advice: it's important to remember that the point is not to \"not think;\" *thinking* is another appearance in consciousness that will arise no matter how much training you have. The experiment is to try to find the 'thinker' behind the thoughts. An exercise that really helped me is substituting \\*thinking\\* with another object of meditation, like \\*hearing\\* or \\*seeing\\*. Next time you meditate, focus on what you hear around you. In the midst of this focus, very briefly, try to find **what** is doing the hearing, or **where** you are hearing from. The best way I can describe the sensation that arises next is like an emptiness in between my ears; I briefly become nothing more than the sounds in my environment. It's a really really neat experience; check out his series with Richard Lang for more of this type of practice. Hope that helps!",

The 'snap turn' exercise should get you there; it's repeated for a few sessions, and it took me at least three sessions to start getting it.\n\nDo one of the sense mindfulness exercises, but interrupt it partway though and quickly assess how you're thinking about the feeling, in a mental 'snap turn'.  If done quickly, you won't find any will or 'thinker' there.  The feeling of your hand is your consciousness directly, without an intermediate step of the dualism 'thinker' interpreting the feeling.\n\nIt's not thoughtlessness, but massaging out reflexive mental knots, so you can focus and expand your thought willfully.",

I found this post moments after watching my sister's cat suffer a fatal seizure (she was heading out the door to the vet, vet set to call again a few minutes later, when we lost her). I sat down to calm down and try to end my panic attack while my sister processes and makes plans in the other roomon, happened to open reddit first instead of my usual relaxing games, and this is the first thing I saw. I wish I'd seen these sooner. Husband and I lost 3 pets and my uncle last year, and it's been absolutely devastating. But they're here in time to process this heart-wrenching and violent loss, and for that, I thank you.\n\nI'd also like to add my own YSK: your pets can catch COVID. And it can have dire consequences for them. Covid went through our house, and this cat, who was just a year old when it started, had such bad liver damage that she has been suffering seizures for nearly a year now. Every time they seemed to be under control with the right medication for a few months, the seizures came back. This was her first one in months, and it was her worst yet. At the same time, my sister's elderly cat suffered the same thing but didn't survive. My elderly cat had a respiratory infection that didn't go away from antibiotics, and suddenly her heart gave out. She had checkups several times a year and has never had heart problems. My dog developed a terrible respiratory illness, her lungs were x-rayed and looked terrible, and I lost her, too. Another cat developed the illness and developed so many ulcers in his mouth (from a respiratory illness, vet said) that he couldn't recover. Another developed FIP, and cost over $6000 for treatment. This is a house for special needs pets, granted, but just please be safe for your pets if not for yourself. Even if you aren't at risk, your pets might be.",

I'm several weeks into my college classes and I've quite literally done nothing but the bare minimum with exams coming up. I just lack any and all energy, I feel like I'm about ready to pass out only hours after waking up. I have zero motivation to do any work and I feel too anxious to even start. I feel like I'm literally caving in on myself and I don't know what to do. I've been trying to work on helping myself by setting up schedules and being active and it helped for some time but I couldn't stick with it, it only took one day of laziness to completely cause me to collapse in on my efforts. I've tried to talking to my mother about it and she simply can't understand why I would feel like this since there is nothing wrong in my life according to her. And my dad just gets upset with me because me bringing it up to my mom causes her to get upset since she gets very stresses out and anxious. \n\nI know what I want from my life yet I just can't push myself out of my stupor to achieve it and I think me being self aware of that just makes me feel more and more like shit every day passes without me having anything to show for it. But I just struggle so much to find the energy to actually go for it. \n\nNot expecting some magical solution to come from me ranting here, but I don't have anybody I can cry on and or rely upon emotionally.

Your mom is wrong-- if you're struggling this much, there is something wrong.\n\nResearch suggests that some apps can help a bit for some people.  My link in the source, and the PsyberGuide site, can both attest to that.  But it sounds like more support than just an app would help you based on how rough things are feeling.  Are there counseling services at your college?  Or can you try getting therapy elsewhere?",

On the surface it looks fine, but there are some things I'd be cautious about.  \n\nFirst, on their app's page, they claim that they're backed in \"research\" and \"psychology,\" but they don't cite anything specific.  (They also have those words in blue which makes them look like hyperlinks that cite research, but they're not actually links lol).  There's also nothing on their website citing research of any kind.  In contrast, Headspace for instance has a page on their site dedicated to research on mindfulness and on their app.  To me, this means that there's no guarantee that the skills or techniques they're teaching you are particularly effective.  They might be, but no one can say for sure.\n\nI also can't find a link to their privacy policy, which is a little concerning.  When you click on their link that says \"Privacy Policy\" in the Google Play store, it takes you to the homepage of their site, where I haven't been able to find a privacy policy.\n\nThose are the two things I'd prioritize when looking into a new mindfulness or mental health app-- whether there's any legit-looking research basis (beyond general claims about being informed by research), and whether there's a solid privacy policy.",

I like the Insight timer, the guided meditations are well-vetted and helpful for students of any level. (I am not a teacher on there, I teach privately and I follow an Eastern Tradition)\n\nI cannot stress enough how important it is to learn meditation from a teacher who has dedicated their life to practicing and sharing their spiritual experience. Many Western students return from a two week meditation retreat in Bali (or similar) and suddenly feel they are equipped to teach. Please find a teacher who has studied and practiced for most of their lives. It can be dangerous to one's mental health if they begin a serious practice and problems develop and they don't have anyone to consult. \n\nThere are many teachers who are on YouTube and such and offer free meditations and they can be contacted directly as well. Similarly, many teachers with decades of experience can be found in local yoga studios, or temples/retreat centers/etc. Get a book or two as well.\n\nGood luck, focus on your breath, be patient. It's a journey, not a destination.",

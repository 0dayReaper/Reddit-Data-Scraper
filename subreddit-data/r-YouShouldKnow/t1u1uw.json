            "comment": "I am concerned that there could be people hiding within all of this, who are using these things as a way to take advantage of Ukrainian refugees.  It has happened before\n\nEdit - to the downvotes, this has happened before.  I think most people commenting on Reddit are those here in the US, or in parts of the world that has been very fortunate to not see conflict in 30, 40, 75 years, and genuinely do not understand the reality.\n\nI have lived through conflict, I\u2019ve had good friends who were killed, I am seeing people in Ukraine go live and I can sympathize for many of them who have been running on nothing but adrenaline, and dissociation, for the last few days.  \n\nI am very happy to see the outpouring of support for the Ukrainian citizens.  At the same time, people need to understand that there does exist a reality of evil mother fuckers who hide amongst the \u201cgood.\u201d \n\nFor example, human trafficking.  Traffickers *thrive* off of events like this, because it\u2019s emotional, scary, and people have to make very big, big decisions, but with very little time to assess.  With men being banned from leaving the country, and being separated from their wives and kids at the border - how do we know that there hasn\u2019t been a market promising to help men escape the country, under false pretenses?  \n\nI don\u2019t think people are thinking about this.  Throughout history we can think of so many examples, so many times where refugees have been taken advantage of,  and I only say this because it may help people who are far away from Ukraine, to understand why there are people who have decided not to flee.",

If they ended up in Romania, it meens they traveled through a lot of countries to end up here (and they usually don't want to stay, as we are not rich, they want to end up in Germany, Austria and so on. And those countries do not want to take them).\n\nYou are right, it's sad that it happens, no matter from what country you are, or what color is your skin.

However, unlike WW 2 that had balanced power on both sides this specific scenerio is Russia vs the world.  China sanctioned Russia and abstained in UN which means theyrr neutral and hoping for a weal response to embolden them to take Taiwan.  The thing is if Putin stays in power and successfully takes Ukraine does anyone feel like he's less capable of using nukes?  He's a psychopath and this is absolutely the best OPPURTUNITY to justify taking out Putin and pushing towards a more peaceful order.",

Turkey, Israel and other locals are condemning them.\n\nWest has already been arming Ukraine w air defense and anti-tank missles and Clinton gave them such guarantees in exchange for them giving uo their nukes.   Russia is slowed bc they can't steamroll with such arms.  West needs to rush a shit ton more arms in there (not personnel) and local countries can dress up in civilian garb and claim to be Ukrainian.  \n\nThis is fucking war and its an oppurtunity for Ukraine to take back Crimea and someone needs to kill Putin and reestablish a peaceful order in the world.  Pussyfooting around and letting Putin continue to creep is not a good future.   In order to save lives people need to be killed  - st. York in WW1",

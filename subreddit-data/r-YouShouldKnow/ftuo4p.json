    "postText": "I spent all day on the phone talking to Spirit Airlines, which is notoriously bad with customer service. They\u2019ve cancelled Northeast flights and I wanted my money back. The service member working with me refused to refund me several times until I did the research and quoted the US Department of Transportation, whose website says, \u201cif your flight is cancelled and you choose to cancel your trip as a result, you are entitled to a refund for the unused transportation.\u201d I also threatened to have my credit card company dispute the charge. Know your rights!\n\n\nEDIT: US Department of Transportation website, which includes a link for consumer complaints for airlines that aren\u2019t honoring this regulation: https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds",

When someone says they're doing a chargeback you better be 110% sure you're in the right as a business or not only will you lose but you'll pay a fee to lose. No idea why any major business would try to bluff a chargeback, they know damn well it's a consumer tool and how it usually ends.",

From what I observed, these kinds of companies know that majority of customers won't make a compliant - and if they will, they'll give up once they're denied the refund, fuming or not. Only customers who mention the law or go to their banks get any serious action",

            "comment": "I've made a new post which encompasses the most common questions and answers here. Please go here.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ComplexConcepts/comments/g7ft9b/a_comprehensive_guide_faqs_on_getting_a_refund/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nTo those who wish to know the actual US law and their rights when trying to get a refund from an airline who does business in the US... Please read 14 CFR Part 374, US contract law (UCC), 49 USC 41712, and the Fair Credit Billing Act. The highlights are all carriers who do business in the US must provide a refund in the original form of payment for a flight they cancelled (for any reason) if requested. The key to getting a refund is not accepting something else of value (e.g. a voucher) for a flight the airline cancelled. If the airline gives you the run around you can always sue, but if you paid with a credit card there is an easier way to get a refund if eligible and applicable which I will go into further details below...\n\nTo those who are trying to get a refund on a non-refundable flight that has been cancelled by the airline, the law is on your side. There are certain criteria that must apply though. One, you used a credit card to pay for the airfare. Two, the airline must have cancelled the flight (even for reasons outside of their control such as the coronavirus pandemic). Three, you cannot have accepted an itinerary change or credit for future travel. Four, you must have made a good faith attempt at getting a refund from the merchant pursuant to United States Code Title 15, Chapter 41, Subchapter I, Part D, Section 1666i(a)(1). And lastly, you must write and mail a letter to your credit card issuer disputing the charge pursuant to USC Title 15, Chapter 41, Subchapter I, Part D, Section 1666(a). Please note, legally, your billing rights are only protected if you send your credit card issuer a written letter within 60 days from the statement date that first showed the charge (so if you paid for your ticket a little more than 60 days from the departure date, you may not be legally protected under this law. Some card issuers may still accept a dispute outside this 60 day window, but it's their discretion). Also, some card issuers do the dispute process online or over the phone, but you still must write and mail them a letter to be legally protected. Exercising this right forces them to start an investigation and respond to your dispute with a decision within 90 days. A sample letter can be found here... https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0385-sample-letter-disputing-billing-errors\n\nThe actual law that entitles you to a refund when an airline cancels a flight is USC Title 15, Chapter 41 Subchapter I Part D Section 1666(b)(3) which basically says if the merchant failed to provide the agreed upon service, it's considered a billing error that the credit card issuer must correct. (Note, this law applies to any credit card transaction, not just to airfare.) In this scenario, however, the agreed upon service is flights departing from a specific location, to a specific location, and on a specific day (note, significant itinerary changes may also qualify as a failure in agreed upon service, but this definition varies among different airlines' contract of carriage). So if the merchant doesn't hold up their end of the deal (e.g. cancelling the flight), it's considered a billing error that your credit card issuer must correct. Most importantly, this law overrules any of the merchant's own policies. But make sure you don't accept an itinerary change or credit for future travel because the merchant (e.g. airline) will use that as evidence to say you accepted a new service agreement, and then the credit card issuer will most likely deny the dispute. \n\nWhat you don't want to do, however, is accept a credit and then try to do a dispute. This is akin to buyer's remorse and is not a disputable billing error. If you still try the dispute, the credit card issuer and the merchant can claim \"friendly fraud\" against you which can have severe consequences.\n\nIn summary, flex your rights with the airline. They usually cave to the refund if they know you know the law. And don't accept a credit for anything if you want a refund. If they still won't budge, do a credit card dispute if eligible, but make sure you document all correspondence with them in order to satisfy Section 1666i requirements of a good faith resolution. I hope this information has been helpful for you.\n\nUpdate: Today, April 3rd, 2020, the DOT issued an enforcement order to all airlines who do business in the US reinforcing these laws. Know your rights people. Don't let these airlines circumvent your rights.\n\nhttps://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/enforcement_notice_refunds_apr_3_2020",

However, to answer your question right now, this is verbatim for what Visa has said and we are seeing it across the board for other payment arrangements:\nScenario 1: the cardholder purchased goods/services and the merchant/co decides to cancel the good/service. E.g. an airline cancels a flight due to low demand. Does an issuer have dispute rights? \"Yes, there is a dispute right when goods/services are not provided for any reason, including bankruptcy or other circumstances. The EXCEPTION is cancellations due to government prohibition as government regulation and/or law supercedes Visa rules on dispute rights. Our expectation is that issuers require a cardholder to attempt to resolve disputes with merchants before initiating a dispute.\"\n\nScenario 2: The cardholder purchased g/s and the co cancels the g/s due to government prohibition. E.g an airline cancels a flight bc the gov't closed the border or a gym closed operations bc of a Gov't mandate to cease operations. Does an issuer have dispute rights? \"No, if the merchant has not provided the service due to a government-imposed prohibition, the cardholder does not have a dispute right. Government regulation and/or law supersedes Visa rules on dispute rights. The cardholder should work directly with the merchant to resolve. \"\n\nAgain, the above is verbatim per Visa. There are other examples that show that if the cardholder (you) cancels due to COVID 19 concerns, they don't think it's a valid dispute. Their belief is that the merchant/co fulfilled its obligations to provide the service (airline or not) and you CHOSE not to use it. Doesn't matter whether or not the world is going to shit bc of a virus; the dispute process is in place bc the COMPANY made a mistake! In Visa/AmEx/Discover's eyes, the company arent making a mistake and so YOU do not have dispute rights. \n\ntl;dr you CAN dispute it, but it is unlikely you will win.",

If you attempt to contact them, they will say to contact them no more than 3 business days  before your flight is supposed to take place, otherwise they don't want to talk with you. And the ones that are cancelling, we are seeing they're not going very far, just however long the travel ban is nationally in place for. Bookit.com, as an example, sent every single one of their customers an email saying that their flight has been cancelled and they aren't going to be providing a refund and to call your financial institution. \n\nThey shut their website down, cut their phone lines, and are going out of business. Per Visa, if you have to cancel due to a travel ban or border closure, you do not have dispute rights.",

It's on Mastercard's network, through Goldman Sachs. Also, as I have edited my response to indicate, this is a **temporary** refund while this is investigated. I may be out of luck and will end up losing the refund, but I am just glad I had this option. I had accepted this money as lost. Some people here have indicated that even if I get to keep the money, American Airlines may make note of my dispute and refuse me service in the future. To that I say: who cares? I don't fly much, and there are plenty of other airlines that I imagine would gladly take my money. Will update when this is ultimately resolved. Thank you, best of luck and good health!",

You got a temp credit from your cc company which is NOT the same as getting a permanent refund from the airline.

Disputing the charge will allow us to place the credit back on your account temporarily while we investigate, but the airline will most likely provide us with a copy of the terms and conditions that were presented to and signed by you at the time of making the purchase, stating the ticket is non-refundable in the event of cancellation (PERIOD) and only an airline credit will be issued. Even if the airline cancels the flight, they still can keep your money because you agreed that if the ticket is cancelled (regardless by who) you weren\u2019t getting a refund do your credit card. The only way to protect yourself and ensure a full refund to your cc is to buy travelers insurance. \n\n\nAlso, once the credit from the dispute is placed on the account, this nullifies the airlines ability to give you the airline credit. And once they provide the terms and conditions, we have to give them the money back and the airline won\u2019t be able to give you even an airline credit.

How is this even helpful to anyone? Does United have some magical inside knowledge to when the borders will open and that I'll be able to use the credit within the year? Wtf. The credit wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have an arbitrary time restriction. Stupid fucks. \n\nAnd my 2nd ticket was through Air Canada, which has to be the worst one to try and get through too because I can't even reach a human to talk to. Fuck Air Canada. \n\nI'm thinking of doing a charge back if they keep being dumbasses about this, but I'm just worried they might black list my account, or my cards. I know Google does something like that if you do a charge back to them, same with SONY. And I kinda need to fly via United several times a year. Air Canada can go eat ass though.",

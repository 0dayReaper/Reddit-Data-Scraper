    "postText": "Why YSK: Cats are so sensitive to the *whole* lily plant that it can be something as little as chewing on a small part of a leaf, grooming some pollen off their fur, or drinking vase water can lead to kidney failure within days. If you have cats, keep lilies out of the house. Lilies are also toxic for dogs, but dog fatalities are much less common than cats. \n\n\nMANY plants are considered toxic for your animals, especially cats. If your cat is known to chew on leaves, double check to make sure your plants aren\u2019t toxic. Toxic can range anywhere from an upset stomach, to something fatal like kidney failure. Unless it specifically says that it will only cause an upset stomach, you may want to lean on the more cautious side and put the plant elsewhere. There are many cute house plants out there that ARENT toxic, you may just have to search them out.\n\nNot *all* lilies are toxic, there are a few that are harmless, but better safe than sorry.

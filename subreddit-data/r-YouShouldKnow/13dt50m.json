            "comment": "I'm all for warning people about AI taking over jobs, but warn the people who matter. No one playing basketball is contributing anything to society. They aren't going to suddenly have no way to make money. Basketball baseball football golf none of these things are important. Warn the mechanics, the fast food workers and the customer service employees. Let the sports players become normal people again and stop putting that pointless shit on TV to distract us from the actually important issues like our government literally robbing us and taking our rights. Fuck basketball.",

You\u2019d be surprised how many products I\u2019ve purchased or places I\u2019ve gone because I saw the ad during a game\u2026. Entertainment does have a contribution to society whether people like or not honestly",

And I think the positives you mention are very much outweighed by the negatives that come from it. Violent outbursts whether the teams win or lose? Why? Every year I see news articles of people flipping cars, breaking necks and lighting things in fire in celebration or in anger over a sports team. Businesses damaged and lives changed or potentially lost is a good thing? It creates a divide between people over petty things and causes clashing both at the events and in everyday life over things like jerseys and hats. It's a distraction to keep people occupied so they aren't worrying about their quality of life. People will work themselves to the bone for a season pass if they have to, but won't question why they have to pay so much, or even better, why they have to spend so much of their lives doing mostly meaningless tasks just to be able to afford the ticket, let alone get the time off to use it.",

A win yes \u2026 and it\u2019s not like it happens every game. It only happens ever so often after a championship celebration. There hasn\u2019t been anything like that for the NBA in a good amount of years \u2026 then you have 5 major sports leagues who\u2019s cities have actually been civilized after a championship win. Yes there\u2019s been a few recent anomalies but a few\u2026. Plus if you\u2019ve been to any of those types of celebrations the damaged property is actual personal and not some random persons car being flipped\u2026I honestly can\u2019t point out any time a life was lost during a wild celebration , neither was a business damaged\u2026. The average purchaser of a \u201cseason pass\u201d isn\u2019t some average Joe either. Season passes aren\u2019t even advertised to average Joes either. So nobody is working themselves to death for a season pass or season tickets either\u2026.You\u2019re not only paying for the price of admission , very good seats but season passes come with a wide range of amenities like free food , drinks , memorabilia , apparel so the Price of the Season tickets actually is comparable for those who can afford it. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to change your mind or anything, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s made up\u2026 but you have an extreme view which won\u2019t allow you to see any positives in this particular subject\u2026.. Small Businesses near stadiums thrive when their team in respective sports thrives. For example \u2026 in Atlanta\u2026The city boomed when they won the bid for the Olympics\u2026. And they\u2019re also about to boom again winning the bid for the World Cup\u2026 they\u2019re in the process of opening downtown up further for new small businesses to open up and take advantage of the traffic that will be here in 2026.",

We shouldn't have a capitalist society. You claim no one riots over a loss but here's just one of many articles brought up with a Google search. https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/05/here-are-five-american-cities-which-rioted-after-sporting-success-and-defeat-7289493/\n\nI don't care what capitalist reasonings you give for sports to exist, at the end of the day sports exist to distract you and keep you fighting the people you should be working together with. Your sports games are only there to amoe sure you and the people in the next city over don't start to have the same thoughts and decide to stand up for your rights. If you take a look at who goes to these events, it's 90% conservative people that are already combative and aggressive, and giving them yet another reason to be angry at anyone who's not them keeps them angry. Sports are a farce to keep people angry and that's all.",

This society is so ass backwards it's not even funny. The government should be taking care of things like food and housing, seeing as their the ones telling me it's illegal to be homeless and I can't kill myself. They should be taking care of every medical condition expense we have, because they're the ones that expect us to work and make money so they don't have to. And you're telling me that some guy that runs back and forth on a wooden floor and throws a ball has more significance the people who wake up every morning and go to work to keep this society running? What does \"entertainment\" provide? People riot in the streets when their sports team loses and they riot in the streets when they win. People are discharging firearms in apartment complexes because they can't handle their football team losing. And those same people losing games are driving around expensive cars breaking the road laws killing people in accidents and just paying people off instead of doing the time in prison for their crimes. Alcoholics literally have more of a place in this society than sports players.",

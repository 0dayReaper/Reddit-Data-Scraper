    "postText": "Why YSK: Many servers do not know or understand their rights. With these tough times, I've experienced this myself as a Bartender and had my restaurant try this on me. I know other servers are all experiencing a huge increase in dine and dashers. Top it off with most people only tipping 10% and its miserable. \n\nMy restaurant in California tried this on me recently. I showed them the law and told them it wasn't happening. They did not like that but they let it drop because to fire me over it would be an insane lawsuit. I'm going to quit soon but thats a different story. \n\nYSK also that every state is a little different. Some states do allow it conditionally, but if you know your states laws, the restaurant will probably not mess with you. A lawsuit can dig up a nasty past and nobody can afford back pay right now. Bassisically, if they make it a problem, and you make it a bigger problem (lawsuit) they will go out of business. Especially right now. \n\nThis applies to a lot of things, like working off the clock, owners/managers taking tips, meetings / writeups off the clock, and many other small tricks they use to save money from you. \n\nTLDR: If a restaurant threatens your paycheck, stand up them. They are probably legally wrong, can't afford a lawsuit, and will back down. If they don't, sue the crap out of them.",

            "comment": "So this is a little complicated. First off, I *absolutely* support workers standing up for their rights and knowing the laws. Fuck shitty managers and corporations trying to screw people working for them.\n\nThe complicated part is that shitty managers don't turn into angels when threatened. If you're faced with an illegal situation like the one in this post, or anything similar, *absolutely* stand up for yourself. But you should also probably start looking for another job. Some managers will try to make your life hell so you quit yourself, or will find any excuse to fire you that's legal. Actually proving they fired you for an illegal reason can be difficult unless there's solid evidence. Yes, they probably can't afford a lawsuit right now, but on the other hand, can you? If they think you can't, they're more likely to push back against you.\n\nSo, yes, absolutely know your rights and stand up for yourself. Just also realize that realistically you're going to need, or at least want, new employment sooner rather than later. And for goodness sake, report the bastards if you can (once you can safely do so)!\n\n**Edit to add some things that are important:**\n\nUnionize, unionize, unionize! It's a great way to help protect yourself and fellow workers from shitty bosses.\n\nI'm seeing lots of \"right to work\" and \"they can fire you for no reason\" comments. Yes, but also no. They don't need a reason, but they *do* need to not have an *illegal* reason. If you're fired out of nowhere after pushing back against your boss's illegal practices, even in a right to work state *that's illegal*. If your hours are cut, you're treated worse, or anything else directly following a confrontation with your boss, *that's illegal*. Document everything and report them /sue them.\n\nDocument everything, always, and keep a paper trail! Keep records of you being a good employee, keep records of them asking you to do illegal things, if you live in a one party consent state record shit on your phone. Email or text them asking for direct confirmation if possible: \"Just making sure, you wanted me to do x, is that correct?\" and *save it all*\n\nThere are lawyers that you don't have to pay unless/until you win.\n\nReport them **everywhere**. Your state's employment board, OSHA, the health inspector, everywhere. Almost every place has *something* not up to standards, and if you can screw them on 2 or 3 fronts they're more likely to settle with you quickly.\n\nWith all that being said, still immediately look for new employment. Yes, it's illegal for them to fire you or cut your hours in retaliation, but that doesn't mean they won't, and you still need to pay for your necessities like rent, groceries, etc. The legal process can get you a lot of money, but it's not always quick. Play it smart, fuck them over, but don't fuck yourself in the process.",

It is definitely difficult to prove intent, but attorneys can use a number of useful methods here. First they are going to probably ask if you have any kind of disciplinary history and what that looks like at your place of work, what are the rules and policies and where are they kept, and interview coworkers and other managers to see if there are observable patterns that could be useful. But almost most importantly the attorney is going to weigh all of that above info against the timing of the retaliatory action. \n\nWere you a great employee who got along well with clients and coworkers until the illegal event? That's going to be harder to defend against. Then that can be strengthened to weakened from contexts.\nPlus, we are not all model employees (and that's okay!). People shouldn't need to be competing constantly (job performance metrics) just to keep their job or have job security. \n\nBut I would overall agree with you that it is not likely a practical route for most. Especially in a suit where at best you're getting a shitty job back and maybe some back wages. \n\nOur legal system is so hopelessly geared towards who can throw the most money at the case rather than who has the best case in a lot but the most cookie cutter or text book examples.",

That\u2019s just basic employment law, at least here in Massachusetts, I\u2019m sure elsewhere.\n\nThat said, it is hard to get an employment law attorney to take your case unless there are substantial damages, since they are paid on a contingency fee basis, meaning they get a percentage of any award that you get in the end, which is primarily influenced by the value of the lost wages.",

They were fighting in the back for quite some time with her being like \"you can't ask that, this labour statute specifically says...\" and him being like \"yeah, okay, but-\". Deeply admire her for walking out that day, ran into her later and she was dealing with talking to the labour board. Hope she got something out of it in the end, honestly I'd have loved to have seen that shithead see some consequences for once. I think she had another job as most of my coworkers did because God forbid any one job give enough hours so she wasn't too bad off at least.\n\nThat restaurant last I heard was still running which is honestly wild to me because I worked there for one summer and by the end of it I think about 3 people who had been there at the start with me were still there.",

They forced all the tips to be split according to the owners, so the sushi chef ended up taking a 50% cut of 10 workers. And they put all of the tip income on the servers and not the chefs, so the sushi chefs didn't have to pay taxes on their 'tips'.\n\nI wanted to pursue legal action but my wife wanted to just quit and let it go.",

Tipping will not be mandatory, but tipping culture won't change overnight. People will still tip for excellent service.  \n  \nAlso, even **if** you make less on weekends (which I argue you won't), you'll make more during the week and will have a steady income you can budget. This is compared to an irregular one where you need double weekend shifts to cover expenses for the week/month.",

I don't eat out much myself but I believe 10-15% is standard in restaurants in the UK. When I worked in bars I made a minimum hourly wage that I would then usually triple in tips on a busy evening.",

Of course, it\u2019s usually employers who use this to their advantage. \n\nSo while it\u2019s illegal for them to fire you for that reason specifically, they can still come up with any other arbitrary reason to fire you, or no reason at all, and it\u2019d be perfectly legal. It would be up to the terminated employee and their lawyer to prove otherwise, usually a long and unaffordable legal battle against a bench of experienced corporate lawyers, too costly for any average person.\n\nEdit: to add, this is also where constructive dismissal comes in, where the employer can dock your hours to almost non-existence (I\u2019ve heard examples as egregious as a couple hours a month) or give you really messed up shift schedules, like second shift one night then first shift the next and just flip flop your schedule all over the place. \n\nNow, \u201cconstructive dismissal\u201d as an action is what this is, however, as a legal term, it would need to be proven that they were intentionally creating a hostile work environment to urge the employee to quit; again, a time and cost-prohibitive legal battle.",

It wasn\u2019t a rule, just more a management will look the other way if you want to do that. \n\nThere were some people who didn\u2019t care about the job that would just risk a write up and sometimes you didn\u2019t get written up like prom weekend or homecoming.

You basically get three strikes in most workplaces, and a dine and dash is one that can be erased with payment. \n\nIf being a server is your livelihood and how you support your family.

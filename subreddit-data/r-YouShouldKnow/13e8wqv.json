Many people will cut their grass very short in the summer months to save them the trouble of mowing it as often. In reality, cutting your lawn short could be harming it more than you think. The intense heat from direct sunlight all day will dry out and often kill your lawn's roots, making it difficult to build a thick lawn and avoid weeds.",

One side of our front yard has been completely planted with native plants, the other half of the front yard has been converted to a fruit and vegetable garden, and most recently we mulched off a 10ft x 20ft section of the backyard to plant prairie grass, wildflowers, and other native pollinator plants. We're also planning on building a small patio section in the side yard right up against the vegetable garden for a fire pit and a shaded place to sit outside.\n\nOverall I'd say so far about 50% of our original yard is gone. The only yard we have left is being kept so our dogs have somewhere to run around and not trample on any flowers.",

Most people aren\u2019t going to give up their entire lawn, and trying to guilt them into it is a non-starter. \n\nInstead, encouraging more diversity in their space is much more palatable to people. Especially those with pets and/or children, along with those who live in tick infested areas. \n\nI try to shrink my lawn a bit every year. But I\u2019m not replacing it with dense wildflowers or tall grasses, because that\u2019s unsafe (due to ticks) and impractical in my area. And my dog will eat anything so I\u2019ve tried to limit toxic greenery in my yard.",

Not a 'my way only' situation at all when  it comes to gardening and benefiting the environment. \n\nGrass around big trees is great so they aren't competing for nutrients. Grass is great if you have pets or kids to play on, or sports to practise. Grass is great if you need line of sight to gates etc, or at night between your windows, grass is great to ensure a lot of sunlight through certsin windows and a view over your garden. Grass is great if you need to carry mulch from one end of your property to the next and dont wanto kill/step on plants in the process. \n\nYou need to balance your priorities.

It has a couple of major issues.\n\n1) It gets killed by basically all major herbicides (this was the OG reason it was phased out of grass seed in the 50s, unrightfully so) so if you want to keep weeds down without weeding, good luck.\n\n1b) Major herbicides also don't kill grass, so grass with inevitably end up in your lawn without tons of work to stop it. \n\n2) It doesn't hold up super well to traffic, so if you use your lawn a lot clover is not great.\n\n3) It attracts a ton of polinators, this is what people see as a benefit but it comes with the cost of if you have children or allergic your chances of an encounter with bees/wasps/ect is much higher.\n\n4) Its not super aggressive. So if you get grubs, or a burn spot or do any sort of digging, chances are you are reseeding + needing reseeding every few years.  \n\n5) It recedes in the winter. For colder climates, this is unimaginably bad. Your back yard becomes a mud pit for 5 months of the year. \n\n6) You are right back to a monoculture. Except now its of even more non native plants.\n\nThe much better way to go is to seed clover into your existing lawn. You get the benefits of clover without most of the draw backs though you will still need to mow. I wish they would have just left it in the grass seed from the 50s.\n\nThere are also a lot better GMOed grasses coming out in the past 10 or so years so its also worth looking at those.",

Here\u2019s what I did: \n\n1) cover as much of your grass as you want with sheets of cardboard, then wet it down thoroughly. It\u2019s a good idea to put a few bricks on it to keep it from going walkabout. \n\n2) leave the cardboard there long enough to completely kill the grass beneath it. Then you can either cut the grass out with a Dutch hoe, or grind the entire area up with a cultivator/rototiller. The latter works best, but it increases the cost due to the rental fee. \n\n3) if your soil is crappy, now is the time to add some composted manure or compost from your own home. Mix it in well with a garden rake. Garden rakes are not the same as leaf rakes, by the way. Lots of folks don\u2019t know that. \n\n4) now it\u2019s time to seed! White (Dutch) clover seed is very inexpensive. I paid $18.99 for a 1 kg bag, which is enough for my yard and all my friends\u2019 yards. I like to mix a bunch of wildflower seeds in with the clover, so I\u2019ve got red and blue flax, several kinds of poppy, daisies, etc.  I simply grab a handful of seed and walk around the yard tossing it until I\u2019ve got the coverage I want. \n\n5) rake it in with your garden rake, and if you can, roll over the entire area with a big plastic roller. I rented one for a day, which cost $20. You can also flatten everything out with a board by standing on it, moving it, standing on it again, moving it\u2026\n\n6) water it in well. It\u2019s important to water every day until the seedlings are well established. \n\n7) once your new masterpiece has taken shape, enjoy it! I get several species of native bees, as well as other cool bugs. I get hummingbirds too, which I never saw until I got rid of my lawn. \n\n8) once established, your wildflower lawn won\u2019t need much maintenance. Water it when it gets really dry, and that\u2019s about it. Every three years or so in Autumn, grab your bag of clover seed and toss some seed around if your plants look a bit tired. Clover self-seeds, which means the majority of the time it takes care of its own propagation. \n\nI also spread some compost from my bin over the area once in a while, say every other year, or whenever I\u2019ve got lots of it and need a place to put it. \n\nMy yard gets a few dandelions every Spring, which I let bloom so the native bees can eat. The clover chokes dandelions out for the most part however, so I have approximately 1/10 the amount my next door neighbour has. \n\n**Costs:** seed, cultivator or dutch hoe, composted poo (optional), and water. \n\nCompared to a grass lawn, a clover lawn costs a **lot** less. No mowing is necessary, so a lawnmower is not required, no fuel is needed for the mower, nor fertiliser for the flowers. Clover needs much less water than grass, so your water bill will drop. \n\nIt was so successful in my front yard, I did the same thing to my much bigger backyard. I sold my lawnmower, and the money I got for it more than covered the costs of switching the whole property to clover and wildflowers. I get neighbours regularly asking how to do the same to their lawns, and my crescent now has 5 fewer grass lawns and counting! \n\nI\u2019m on a goddamn mission! \n\nHow\u2019s that? Do you have any questions?",

Which is even worse.  Ive told my son not to listen to him any more. The front lawn is around 3 inches now with loads of dandelions. To be fair it was only cut beginning of last week, bit its been warm and wet in equal mesaures. If it had been up to my husband that grass would be cut every single day. If he moans I give him a pair of scissors and tell him to cut it himself. Obviously he doesnt as he has more muscles in his mouth than the rest of his body lol (I still love him though )",

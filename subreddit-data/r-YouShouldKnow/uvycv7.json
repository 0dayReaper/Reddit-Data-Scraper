    "postText": "Why YSK: It's extremely common for employers to deduct losses from employee's checks if they believe the employee had some responsibility for that loss. In some states this is illegal as well, but overall the employer cannot do this if it means you will earn less than minimum wage.\n\nSome states enacted laws that force employers to pay out triple damages for violations of several wage laws. Most states will fine the company $1000.\n\nhttps://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/\n\nEdit: File a complaint. It's free. You should at least need a paystub showing that they deducted money or didn't pay you minimum wage.\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/faq/workers",

I was like \"why the heck are you here?\", he just said he couldn't afford to miss a shift.  I then had to explain to him, which management didn't, that due to new laws being passed we all had been accruing paid sick leave, and showed him how to see how much he had in the ADP app.  He then saw he had a week PTO, and told management he was going home.  They were pissed at me, but I was just like \"would you rather have half the staff get sick and then you have no one able to work?\"",

Aside from sometimes wanting to throw someone off a building it was straightforward. People actually wanted to work and did good work too. I had to send them home if they were sick. I think it\u2019s just being somewhat intelligent and designing a job so it doesn\u2019t make people wanna ram their head into a wall all day. Gotta say though, while I didn\u2019t demand any diplomas, I did demand a certain kind of attitude and some common sense. I\u2018d rather have worked double shift than let some douche poison my workforce. This attitude is seen as toxic in other places though. If you think for yourself you\u2018re a threat to the company in a lot of places I worked before.",

We would regularly see discrepancies between my count down value and her's when we would count out my money at the end of the night (delivering pizzas). She would constantly come up short and try it pin it on me like I'm responsible/obligated to come up with the missing money and if I can't, it's coming out of my pocket. Well, little did she know the GM and I closed together on a weekly basis on the busiest day of the week for several years in a row. The GM and I were always spot on, down to the penny on count down, so he without question took my side. She was the reason we got cameras, cause she was accusing drivers of stealing money. The best part is the hidden camera in the office caught her stealing in 4k and the GM fired her ass. He also reversed the one write up I ever got in my time working there when she tried to take $30 from me and I told her to kiss my ass and left with the money. It felt good. I saw her at costco a few months later and called her a bitch and told the nearby manager to \"keep a close eye on this one.\"",

Wage theft can take many forms, including but not limited to:\n\n**Minimum wage violations**: Paying workers less than the legal minimum wage\n\n**Overtime violations**: Failing to pay nonexempt employees time-and-a-half for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week\n\n**Off-the-clock violations**: Asking employees to work off-the-clock before or after their shifts\n\n**Meal break violations**: Denying workers their legal meal breaks\n\n**Pay stub and illegal deductions**: Taking illegal deductions from wages or not distributing pay stubs\n\n**Tipped minimum wage violations**: Confiscating tips from workers or failing to pay tipped workers the difference between their tips and the legal minimum wage\n\n**Employee misclassification violations**: Misclassifying employees as independent contractors to pay a wage lower than the legal minimum\n\nFor more information about the different forms of wage theft, see Bernhardt et al.

Even after filing for misclassification and unpaid wages I never saw another dime out of them (I should have taken them to court but I was young and impatient).\n\nThey also tried to say that one of my friends was an unpaid intern. He took orders. We pulled up the laws for it and asked if she filed any paperwork to be able to hire interns, she said no comment. Then we asked what skills was she teaching him to be able to call him an intern, and she said \"to read and write.\" The dude was 23 and had better English skills then any of them. We both walked out after that conversation and I began reporting them for everything I could. Health department, DOL, etc.\n\n I wouldn't doubt if any of the workers were deported. They would rotate their cooks around the country then send them back to China each year and bring a new round of cooks, they all lived in the same 2 br apartment.",

At a lot of places, 8 or more hours requires a lunch by law so a lot of payroll software auto deducts it with the assumption that the employee forgot to clock out. Also, either way the company is breaking the law, one way by not paying fair wages, another by not following fair labor standards. Not giving them a break is a lot easier to prove than adding one in not paying for it.\n\nAt my company its understood that you're required to take a lunch if you work more than 7 hours or it will be deducted. It's not a secret. If we get busy on what was supposed to be a 7 hours no lunch shift and would end up having to work more than 7.5 most of us will say fuck it and leave rather than finish what we're working on, because that requires taking a lunch and staying another hour.",

It was perfectly legal, because we all worked 29.75 hours each week, and you are only given breaks/lunches if you work 30 or more per week, regardless of how long the individual shifts are. In theory, under AZ law, it would be perfectly legal for an employer to schedule you to work 30 hours straight, with no breaks or meals, so long as you don't exceed 30 hours in one week. \n\nKeep in mind, we were using all sorts of equipment that would easily crush a finger, arm, or leg, and were doing so for 10 hours straight. A lot of guys would end up eating while they worked, so that they wouldn't get lightheaded, but that meant they were getting tire dust on their food. Just imagine what cars run over on a daily basis (animal waste and roadkill, for example) and you can figure out how absolutely horrifying that was. \n\nThat store was a total mess in other areas too. The schedule only got posted on the Monday morning of the week, meaning everyone would have to drive in, in their uniform and ready to work, only for half of us to then find out we weren't working that day, and go home. If you were really unlucky, you'd be scheduled for Monday afternoon, meaning you'd drive into work, only to drive back home for a couple hours, then come back to work. Needless to say, I only worked there for a short time, it was not worth the pay, or losing a body part.",

I can find no law in Arizona (or anywhere) requiring breaks for employees more than 30 hours. Such a law wouldn't make much sense. So that was a misunderstanding by someone.\n\nIf they were scheduling everyone under 30 hours it was *probably* so they didn't have to pay for health insurance for you all. \n\nCough:\n\n&gt;*The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires employers to offer health insurance to employees working at least 30 hours per week (or 130 hours per month) to avoid paying penalties.*\n\nI don't think there's anything in the world that affects everyone but is as misunderstood as is employment law. Partially because everyone thinks that whatever their circumstance is, is normal. So they never learn they've been being fucked. I have half a mind to require workers to take a 15-minute course annually to teach them about employment law, the way us managers and bosses have to take sexual harassment training, required by law, in some states every year. Make it so that employers are required to give the training (online). But of course, if an employer wants to break employment law, they could start with that one.\n\nAnd it doesn't help that many people don't realize these things vary a lot by state. Someone perfectly legal in TX might be a serious legal violation in CA. *Generally* speaking the bluer the state the more protections and the higher the wage.\n\nCheck this out:\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/meal-breaks\n\nArizona doesn't even have any break laws.",

High five!\n Also, I don't think people understand just how hard it can be to recover from a fuck-off gran mal, or how taxing epilepsy is in general whether you're having a seizure or not. \n\nFun fact #1: I tend to work with sharp, fast'n'spinny, dangerous blades :D good career choice.\nFun fact #2: You just reminded me to take my meds. God damn im bad at forgetting to take them; an ironic effect of having seizures. I'm so sorry you have to pay for medication and feel pressured to work insane fucking wages for it...not even 3 dollars an hour?!?! Jesus shitting Christ... Hell I'll send some free meds over..\n\nSorry I just get excited if i see another involuntary breakdancer in the wild!\n\nReally glad you won the case! Hope your 'lepsy is under control :)",

That means like 47% of Americans work, \"regardless of age\".  53% isn't a vast majority by any stretch of the phrase.\n\nQuick googling says there's about 60m under-14s, and almost as many 55+, of which half are retired.\n\nSo of the ~220m working-age, non-retired Americans, 157 million have jobs, meaning that at least 70% are able to work.\n\nAnd after writing this, I realized that the Bureau of Labor Statistics already did the math for me.

After we paid everyone out and split tips, we were all gonna walk home with about $60 each, $35 on the paycheck before taxes.    \nBut the register was $80 off. The owner made us split the amount missing in the register to pay back for losses, so $20 each. He made close to $1k in sales that night. I had never heard of such a weird practice, and I knew that businesses generally account for losses so that it\u2019s not on the employees unless they\u2019re caught stealing. Mistakes happen, and he never trained anyone to count money correctly there. But all of my seniors did paid without fuss, so I did too.      \nSo for 7 hours of practically running back and forth to make drinks, dealing with rude clients, AND no break (7 hr shifts are common so you don\u2019t legally get a break) - my gross income was $95 which isn\u2019t bad for being in school. But after all the tax math is done, and because we had to report our tips as well (the amount BEFORE we \u201cpaid him back\u201d) - my net income was about $55. So the job advertised as \u201cafter tips it\u2019s almost $15/hour!\u201d And the reality was after tips I made barely over $7 an hour. That type of night was significantly more common than being able to leave without \u201cpaying the register.\u201d    \nLuckily, I had worked at bars before and knew it was utter bullshit. I quickly found a different job \ud83d\ude43",

My boss said if we describe a specific dish wrong and they send it back we will have to pay for it- he made this very clear and his only reason was it's the most expensive thing we have @150, that's about exactly/more than what we would make in one night.) But I was wondering if they could take x amount of tips as long as that leaves you with minimum wage at the end of the day, legally.  But also, I'd never work at a place like this.

The company is required to mitigate these risks. So in a kitchen or bar job, they have to mitigate the risk of slips and falls by providing you with non-slip shoes. They can get fined if they don't do these things.",

I was usually there until 30-45 minutes past closing due to cleaning up the place and prepping it for the morning.\n\nWe got a new register, and I always took a receipt after clocking out so I could keep track of my hours, which I wasn't great about looking at. But when the new register was installed, I happened to check the slip after I clocked out my second day of working. It turns out, my boss had removed 30 minutes off my time from my last shift.\n\nI confronted my boss, and she got nervous/angry and balled up the evidence in her hand and threw it away. She yelled at me, but I can't remember a word she said. All I remember is she got caught, and she knew it. \n\nI reported it to the owner of that Subway, and he tried to turn it around on me and ask if I was \"allowed\" to take that slip to track my hours. Why the f--- wouldn't I be allowed to do so? They're the ones who did something very illegal! \n\nHe offered to give me an additional four hours of pay on my next check. I had been working there for six months, and I'd been working four days every week. I lost a lot more than four hours' of pay! But I was a na\u00efve teen, and I agreed to the four hours of extra pay. I should've taken my evidence to the district attorney and let him investigate it. \n\nThe ability to take a slip at the end of my shift was removed as an option. I didn't fight it because I only worked there for a couple more weeks before I was done.",

I would never treat an employee the way some people say they are treated.  I take care of the uniforms for my employees.  I installed a washer dryer unit in the back of the store so they don't have to do their own laundry.  Why should they have to worry about work when not at work.  When cash is missing it most often turns back up later.  I do have to watch the cameras every so often to make sure no one is stealing but I've been fortunate to not have much theft so I guess I'm lucky in that regard.  Stolen meals?  Really ?  If you work for me and are hungry take food and eat it for gods sake.  I'd rather have you fed than not eat.  If you don't want my food order something and have it delivered.  I don't care.  If you work a double shift for me I'm giving you a break and paying for you food from where ever you want it.  Wrong deliveries isn't on the people working, and we rarely screw orders up.  Honestly if you tell the customers what you're handing them they usually catch any mistakes you may have not gotten.  Damaged products I haven't had to deal with fortunately.  If you work for me and your work is done and no customers are there go ahead and sit down, I don't care.  Just stand up and wait on the customers when they come in.

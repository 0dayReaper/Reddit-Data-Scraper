Every 5 years, you\u2019ll have 10% less purchasing power, so make sure you\u2019re getting those raises whether it be asking your boss or finding a new job at a new place.",

Until recently we would get a yearly raise of 0-3%. \n\nIf I hadn\u2019t been promoted twice, I would be making less than the new hires that started at 15-16.50. Some who were there over 5 years were making less than the new people they were training. \nI was a lead for 5 years, and at least one coworker who had just started was making $1 less than me per hour. \n\n\nWhen I was promoted to Assistant Supervisor I was told that I could not expect to get the same pay as the person who had the job before me because it is too big of an increase from what I was getting.\n\n\nSo, since I was already underpaid I will continue to be underpaid. \n\n\nNow they are saying that there will be no raises over 1% until further notice.\n\n\nWant to quit, but not sure where I would go. I have a lot of skills but no Bachelors. Even completed a Six Sigma project, but the certification was never finished. Manager basically said, \u201cwell we paid her for the time she worked.\u201d",

(That assumes you're following good investing principles like continual investing, don't panic sell, reinvest dividends, etc).\n\nI find the mid-term (5-10y) to be challenging right now with rates so low, but a solid Roth IRA is a decent substitute as it can be used in cases of emergency. And then, if rates ever return to decent levels, CDs and T-bills would return to favor in the mid-term, I think.\n\nEdit: If you see this post and want to get started investing, please see the resources I used to get started [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lqqkze/ysk_that_if_you_arent_getting_a_2_raise_every/goj0ags?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since then is 10.27%. The S&amp;P 500 is a pretty good proxy for the total market.\n\nSince 1957, over any 30-year period, the 10th percentile CAGR return is 9.96% .... in other words, in any 30-year period since 1957 the S&amp;P 500 has returned a CAGR of 9.96% or better 90% of the time.\n\nSince 1957 there have only been 3 times where the S&amp;P 500 was negative for 2-years in a row .... 1973/74, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002. In other words, the market, as represented by the S&amp;P 500, almost always rebounds after a bad year. In that period there has been 3 negative years in a row one time .... the dot com bubble + 9-11 and Afghanistan .... 2000/2001/2002.\n\nSince 1957 the longest positive streaks for the S&amp;P 500 have been 9-years. Twice. 1992-1999 and 2009-2017. Assuming 2021 stays positive, that would be 3 positive years in a row. The average S&amp;P 500 positive run is about 4-1/2 years.\n\n\"The only people that get hurt on the roller coaster are those who jump off.\"\n\nThere will be corrections. There will be bad years. If you can, save more when there's a dip. If you're in for the long-term, then stay in and ride it out.",

I think that finance is a goddamn racket, intentionally obfuscated to prevent the accumulation of wealth for the average person. But I'll get off my soap-box and share some links. All I ask is that, if you watch any and find benefit, make sure to pass them along to the next person who is confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first series I ever watched. Incredibly basic breakdown by a dorky professor, but he preaches Boglehead investing (set-and-forget) and breaks everything down into layman's terms. He covers most things you need to consider and this foundation alone has lead to great success for me. It looks like he has an update 10 step series posted 7 months ago, but I used this one:\n\n[Financing Life (Video 1 of 10, about 45min total for whole series)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYkSgR6qhCg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you have that, if you want more, then I have a few different recommendations:\n\n[FIRE Flow Chart -- this helps determine where your money should go. It is way more robust when I first looked, wow! But it should help you develop a workable plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ecn2hk/fire_flow_chart_version_42/) (The short is -- emergency fund, pay off high-interest debt, capture employer 401k match, max IRA, max HSA, max 401k, in that order).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheck out the Bogleheads Wiki -- [Specifically the Three Fund Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). This is 80% of my investing, just simple set-and-forget. I believe a lot of this is covered in the initial video series, but you can find much more in the Wiki. If you like that thought process, it is based on the Intelligent Investor book by Benjamin Graham.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit makes it super easy to switch accounts now, so I recommend people that want to quickly increase their understanding to make a new account and subscribe to /r/personalfinance, /r/investing, and /r/financialindependence. Add subreddits for news or stock-picks as you gain knowledge. Those subs are all conservative investing subreddits, so the advice is typically risk-averse, which is good for a beginner. Take everything with a grain of salt, this is reddit after all. But you'll quickly start to see trends in common investing advice and research that supports it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to start getting into stocks, I read \"the little book that (still) beats the market\". I, personally, do not follow the advice in the book, but it is a quick read that will make sure you understand what you're buying when you buy a stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom there, you can read \"A Random Walk Down Wallstreet\" for an introduction to efficient market hypothesis (and the criticisms of it). I've been recommended \"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\" as well, but never read it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you do all that, a lot of the mystery will be taken out of the market and you should have an understanding of what is available to you. So when you see someone say \"after 5 years of having a Roth IRA, you can withdraw directly from the principle penalty free,\" you can say no duh ;).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I know I just posted a lot of information. I would say that, beyond that initial video, I have barely ever spent more than casual browsing/reading time on investing -- I seek to capture the gains of the market and have been able to do so with that foundation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf nothing else, watch the video series! Best of luck to you! And know I am always available via DM if you want a stranger's uninformed opinion on investing!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I forgot that I also used the Khan Academy Finance section for a lot of the basics. Good info there to get you up to speed! [Found here.](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/stock-and-bonds)",

Just get something like a targeted retirement fund.  That's what I have.  \n\nWhen you have a good nest egg and you feel like getting dorky, you can invest a little in crap you're interested in.  I treat it like fun money I'm pissing away which it is.  I'm into goofy penny stocks I think might go up in the far off future.  I read a lot of scientific journal articles.  \"Oh, that's going to go somewhere.  Ok own this, I think that will lead to that, so yeah, I'm going to buy a few companies like that.\"  Vague, but I don't want to explain too much.  Like if you read about a new kind of paint that's revolutionary and will use a lot of glitter, I'd invest in glitter companies.  99.9% of the time they are penny stocks.

Six months later it's going for around $750. Yes you lost money but you chose not to realize those losses. You kept it in there. February 2011 it rises back to $1250. February 2021 it's at $3880.\n\nThat comes out to about 9% a year even if you had awful timing. That's a whole lot better than measley 0.50% APR you'll get on a savings account. People who keep a short time horizon in the market, panic sell, and keep their money in savings will just bleed to inflation.\n\nProbably my biggest concern is that very high level of inflation is around the corner. The US has printed a lot of money lately to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic and it's consequences haven't quite caught up just yet. Cash positions lose more than just 2% when that inflation comes. Any sort of assets will grow in value.",

It is a little harsh for some people to call you and your parents stupid but I would say there are lessons to be found here. The real shortcoming would be to not have learned from this and live in fear of the market.\n\nAn emergency fund that covers at least 6 months of expenses is a practice that most Americans do not do. In the event that I get laid off, my fund will pay for all my housing, food, utilities, (even my church tithe), and to keep providing my dog with the standard of living she is accustomed to for at least 6 months before I have to sell any assets. If you don't have an emergency fund that covers a mortgage and living costs for 6 months while you search for a job, then you end up hurting real assets at bad times.\n\nOne of the biggest fallacies many Americans believe is that the home they buy and live in is an asset. Robert Kiyosaki discusses this in his famous book *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*. When you buy a home, you don't own it, the bank owns it. You don't own it until you've paid it off, until then it's a huge liability. It adds to your monthly expenses.",

But if you wait for the price to recover before you sell, then you haven\u2019t lost any money.\n\nOn average (meaning on long time scales of 10+ years), the stock market has risen to outpace inflation by about 4% annually. That\u2019s taking into account the Great Depression, the stagflation of the back half of the 1900s, the dot com bubble and crash, the 2008-9 recession, and the COVID market crash. Even after all that, if your money is in the stock market for longer than 10 years, then you will make money not lose it.

Not that I have any other options.\n\nSo I'm in charge of 20+ million dollar equipment right now and also being dicked around by my employer.",

The Social Security Administration releases statics on this type of data every year to figure out how Social Security income checks needs to be adjusted for changes in inflation and cost of living. The department of Labor Statics probably also has a ton of info on this stuff too.

Normally, one would expect an increase in money supply to cause inflation. But in fact, inflation has been negligible in 2020 -- just over half a percent compared to the two percent average (and target for the Fed in the US).\n\nThat suggests that if there had been no stimulus or less stimulus, inflation wouldn't have just been flat, it would have been negative.  That's not crazy because one of the things that could cause deflation is a massive decrease in spending and increase in savings. People stop buying widgets, widget manufacturers have to lower their prices.\n\nFor example, if many people are locked in their houses for a year and terrified of losing their jobs so they start aggressively saving money and stop spending money on whole categories of goods they used to buy regularly.\n\nThe reason deflation is so scary is the possibility of a deflationary spiral.  People stop wanting to buy widgets. Widget company lays a bunch of people off.  Widget demand goes down even further because all the widget makers are out of work and can't afford widgets. Rinse, repeat.\n\nAlso, deflationary circumstances further incentivize people to save money. I have a dollar now that I know will buy 10 widgets today.  Yesterday it would have bought 9 widgets. I have good reason to suspect that tomorrow it will buy 11 widgets. Why would I buy a widget today unless I ABSOLUTELY have to, when I could go wait and buy 11 tomorrow for the same dollar. This furthers the spiral effect -- nobody spends money except on things they need right now. Demand continues to go down, causing further deflation. Rinse, repeat.\n\nIt's really, really bad -- it's conventionally understood as a major factor in the Great Depression.\n\nRealistically, I don't think deflation is very likely right now. Central banks and governments have responded to the threat so far. But there was a real threat of it in say March or April 2020",

Raises? Nope, because they were \"still hurting from the year prior\".\n\nLast year, starting during COVID, we had an absolute record breaking year. Like just shattered all forecasts and pretty much made up the deficit from two years ago. Raises? Nope, because \"who knows what could happen with COVID\". \n\nSo yeah, there's been a pretty big mass exodus of talent and then they have trouble bringing in new people so they hire worse and worse talent. We're getting pretty darn close to the point where the cost of contract penalties (due to problems occurred from this worse talent) will cost them more than if they'd just given out raises.",

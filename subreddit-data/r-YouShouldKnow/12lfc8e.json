They're not going to rinse out your pee bottles or pick q-tips out of the newspaper pile.  It's not cost effective to do so.  Recycling centers are not charities volunteering for the greater good... they are  companies that need to pay their employees and power bill.",

                            "comment": "The bigger problem is that companies exist to make profits.  Even if the waste management and recycling companies were non-profit, if Pepsi can get virgin plastic cheaper than recycled plastic, then why would they take the recycled plastic?  And, that is assuming all other costs are equal.  (Recycled plastic might have a higher cost to manufacture/form, due to a variety of factors.)\n\nIn fact, this is one of the main reasons why the amount of recycled content is bragged about so much on packaging.  The company is hoping to offset some of the additional cost by winning over consumers: \"we use 100% recycled plastic, so if you care about the environment, choose our products over our competitors'\".\n\nIf we wanted to encourage recycling, it would not be too difficult.  First, encourage companies to use more recycled material.  This would increase the demand for recycling, and would make it easier for companies that handle and process material for recycling.  A second part of that would be to discourage the use of non-recyclable plastics for disposable packaging.  (Think plastic soft drink cups.)\n\nSecond, convince consumers to choose recycled packaging over non-recycled.  If a company has to pay more to use recycled material, but then gets more customers, the company can offset the additional cost.\n\nThird, and this is more toward the reason why we want to recycle, rather than actually recycling, is to encourage companies to reduce and reuse.  If I could bring my empty bottle of washing-up soap, and just purchase a refill from the shop, that would be far better than even the best recycling process.  If boxes of breakfast cereal were replaced with paper bags (with a very thin plastic liner), that would be better than the thick cardboard plus plastic inner bag.  And, so on.  This would be difficult however, since neither companies nor consumers seem to like this kind of thing at the moment.\n\nPersonally, I like aluminium containers.  Aluminium is very recyclable, very reusable, and it can easily be crushed down and stored in large blocks for long periods in case the price of virgin aluminium drops below the price of recycled aluminium.  I also just like the feel of aluminium containers over plastic.  I know it has some issues depending on the product stored, and for acidic food/drink products, it needs a liner that cannot be recycled.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: These people are abusing these animals, and many of them, despite getting \u201crescued\u201d are likely actually dead because of the abuse they suffered. More attention needs to be brought to this so that Youtube can shut them down\n\nNick Crowley has a good video on this explaining the situation (Trigger warning, even though he blurs things out it can still be upsetting watching these animals getting abused)\n\nIn the video, he covered these two channels, originally called Happy Dog and Rescue Journey TV when the video was made. After the video both channels changed their names and turned off comments\n\nBoth videos will upload almost daily videos showing dogs and cats in almost impossible situations, just to pull them out, in some cases using the same dog or cat more than one time for multiple rescues and performing rescues that seem to garner the most views. \n\nIt\u2019s completely despicable and I have no doubt these aren\u2019t the only two channels that do these things. There\u2019s likely an entire plethora of channels with poor animals getting hurt just to gain internet fame. \n\nThis needs more attention so that Youtube will finally step up and crack down on channels that do this, so that no more innocent animals need to get hurt just so someone can receive that internet clout\n\nEdit. u/chillin_iceBear posted a link exposing even more channels that abuse animals\n\n[This is the original video Nick Crowley posted that exposed the channels I listed ](https://youtu.be/p7nVntZpJLM) \n\n[This is the follow up he made that exposes even more](https://youtu.be/fqPXcv-IE0k)\n\nAlso as mentioned by several people [paymoneywubby made a video about this too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mvVQCl8fIg)",

I make community captioned translations for indie music videos into English because most channels don't allow you to reprint videos with the subtitles. Luckily there seems to be a subscription service?? Which is kinda like a country club for translators they're making. Anyone who has made a community contribution within a certain allotted time will get a trial, but I believe it's a lot more involved for the source media creator and there's a lot more trust they need to have in you since you become more involved in their account. A lot of people focus on the deaf community since they're a large portion gravely effected by this but translator communities are a lot bigger than people think and we're also largely affected by this. If anyone is reading this please bring this to people's attention and keep talking about it. I don't know what much can be done since yt doesn't seem to want to listen to anyone. The reason they gave for this removal is because some people would grief the subtitles (Which I've never seen personally but I don't doubt it happens.) the amount of captioners and translators effected is much larger. I wish they would've taken more time to find a better solution like a way to rate translators or anyone who provides captions so that youtubers can be more aware of who they're letting touch their subtitles rather than removing the feature out of left field like this. \n\nMy laments may never be heard but I can at least dream.",

It was fake of course, but people were so shocked they kept sending it to all their contacts and feeding into the scam/spam.  \nIt\u2019s nothing new, but it\u2019s becoming more &amp; more common with social media.\n\nYou should *never*, ever like, comment or share a video of a rescue unless it comes from a well-known rescue organization. Always second-guess what you see online. Ask yourself what the poster has to gain from this. If it\u2019s a random account with no charity affiliation, they\u2019re either doing it for fame or for money.\n\nRecently there was a guy on Instagram who posted stories torturing kittens saying things like \u201cI will kill that cat if I don\u2019t get 100 likes\u201d. People were reporting it, but mostly they were liking because they thought it would save the cat. All it did was that he kept hurting the kitten for longer &amp; asking for bigger numbers of likes.  \nWhat you need to do is make a screenshot and report (not just to the app but to the authorities, in this instance at least) so they can be found and prosecuted.\n\nAs long as animal videos will be popular, there will be people exploiting animals into doing *tricks*, things that are entirely against their natural instinct, and all sorts of abuse. Please don\u2019t support this by liking or commenting !",

For instance a puppy from Puppy Love (Happy Dogs) was found tied up in wire so bad it couldn\u2019t move, while also trapped in a den of chairs (at least I think they were chairs) with very little room to move. The puppy was tied up so bad it couldn\u2019t move so it would\u2019ve had to have gotten tied up after it got trapped by the chairs. But the only way it could have gotten that tangled in the first place is if it got it stuck, and after struggling to escape got even more tangled. But the chairs offered very little room to offer that kind of movement, meaning the chances of it actually getting stuck like that is very slim\n\nNot to mention even though the video supposedly showed uninterrupted the rescuers discovering the puppy to rescuing it, the thumbnail showed a picture of the puppy stuck that never was actually seen in the video, implying they took that photo off camera, aka, BEFORE they supposedly found the puppy\n\nThey also had a video of a puppy getting attacked by a snake. At this point, I think the channel had been up for 5 months without any snake attacks, implying a snake attack is kinda rare. But the snake video got a over 90 million views, suddenly the channel published another 13 videos of dogs getting attacked by snakes. In one, a puppy is apparently bitten by a King Cobra, which is so deadly it\u2019s venom could take down an elephant. In the video where they rescue the puppy you can see the bite mark, and it\u2019s dirty. But on the way to the vet, the bite mark is gone and the puppies clean. Meaning they probably took that vet video BEFORE putting the puppy with the Cobra. So that puppy realistically is dead \n\nAnd as I mentioned before, they will sometimes reuse the same animals (In the case of Pets Kittens, they do it all the time) The animals will have the exact same fur pattern, the exact same face, eye color, etc. \n\nPets Kittens will also photoshop the thumbnails of some of their videos to show animals covered in blood when they weren\u2019t\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough evidence, both channels had to change their name and disabled comments. Why would they do that if their channels were legitimate?\n\n(And again, the video made by Nick Crowley goes into wayyy more detail. This is just a few key points he made)",

The man is seen walking around the big trucks the same exact way listening to this loud kitten scream. But when you see him pulling the kitten, it's mouth doesn't move but you can still hear the kitten scream being played.\n\nOne of these is the same video you speak of saying that they photoshop blood into the thumbnail because I clearly saw blood on the kittens nose in the picture and then in the video the kitten was perfectly fine.",

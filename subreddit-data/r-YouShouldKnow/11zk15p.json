    "postText": "\n\nWhy YSK: In a number of East Coast (U.S.) cities, heroin has largely been replaced by Fentanyl, which is understood by users. What is new(-ish) is that the Fentanyl is cut with Xylazine, which is a tranquilizer. (This is the primary reason for the \u201czombie\u201d videos out of Kensington, Phila.)\n\nNarcan is an opiate antagonist, which, when given to an overdose patient, counteracts the effect of the Fentanyl, but has no effect for the Xylazine. For this reason, it\u2019s important to use CPR in conjunction with Narcan, as there\u2019s a good chance Narcan alone won\u2019t revive the person.\n\nAlso YSK: if a person is physically dependent on opiates, Narcan will send them into withdrawal immediately, so they\u2019re going to feel terrible, and may be upset. It seems, though, that if they\u2019ve also ingested Xylazine, they\u2019re still pretty well sedated. And always call 911 before administering help.\n\n[Narcan Resource (U.S.)](https://nextdistro.org/)\n\n[CPR Resource (U.S.)](https://ahainstructornetwork.americanheart.org/AHAECC/classConnector.jsp?pid=ahaecc.classconnector.home&amp;_ga=2.43630629.1229995069.1679575745-1528463512.1679575745)\n\nPS: this is not a forum to discuss the value of a person\u2019s life. If you\u2019re not interested in helping someone who has overdosed, there\u2019s no need to comment on this post.\n\nEdited: Narcan is an opiate antagonist.",

Correction: Narcan/Naloxone is an opiate antagonist, otherwise, excellent information.\n\nAgonist (think protagonist)  works in a positive way with a given receptor\n\nAntagonist works against\n\nAnd in regards to terms relating to muscles a synergist is something that works in conjunction with, or creates a similar effect to other agonists.\n\nHOWEVER an important note, if you are giving Naloxone, and the person has a pulse.  DO NOT PROVIDE CHEST COMPRESSIONS, just because they're unresponsive and remain so after administration.  Monitor pulse and breathing, administer rescue breaths if trained and comfortable doing so.  Opiates (and to an extent all sedatives) reduce respiratory drive, so ensuring the person is breathing is the best thing you can do (unless both pulseless and apneic, then CPR)\n\nCompressions on somebody with a pulse only causes trauma and may also negatively impact the heart.",

Give it a 10 second once over and wait to see if they are breathing",

In ems our next steps would be asses for a pulse.  If he did have a pulse we would use a \u201cbag valve mask\u201d which is the name of the device we use to supplement or assist people\u2019s respirations.  I\u2019m not familiar with the latest of what is being taught and asked of the general public, did the dispatcher ask you to give breaths along with the chest compressions? or only give compressions?\n\nA respiratory rate of 3 per min is not adequate and needs to be addressed.   While performing cpr on someone who\u2019s heart is still beating is potentially dangerous and likely painful once they come to, I think a very valid argument could be made that in a scenario like you are describing doing nothing at all is much worse for the patient.  At the very least the stimulation of someone pushing on their chest would likely stimulate them to breathe\n\nAlso to add, I\u2019m not sure your level of training but often times when bystanders with little to no training are performing cpr it is not nearly deep enough on the compressions.  Cpr is violent and more often than not on people 50+ years old you will break ribs on the first few compressions.",

They used to teach 30 compressions to 2 breaths but apparently found that the germ/cleanliness concern of people blowing in a strangers mouth  would keep them from intervening.  Also a large body of research shows that if you can keep the blood circulating (which is what cpr is doing) it can be almost as effective as the chest compressions combined with artificial ventilations.  Because of this the idea is to teach hands only cpr so that more people will intervene as opposed to shy away because they don\u2019t feel comfortable blowing in a strangers mouth.  80% of something is better than 100% of nothing \n\n&gt;",

It was from someone who had... I want to say stomach cancer, and this was maybe 15 years ago.  But the bottle was legitimate-looking, had all the explanations and markings you'd expect for a medical product, not just \u2620\ufe0f MORPHINE \u2620\ufe0f or something.  A friend told me \"I drank like an ounce and threw up, I figured you'd know more\" (I was/am fairly knowledgeable about recreational drugs, and own a couple physician's desk references).  So he offered me several ounces if I could figure out an actual dose.  I looked it up and it said A QUARTER TEASPOON.  He was so lucky he threw it up.  After trying that I upped it to half a teaspoon or better, and that was the second-most intense opiate experience I've ever had.  I could literally lift my leg up and drop it with zero resistance (sounds benign but it's REALLY hard to do unless you're sedated) and I actually had to consciously breathe.  There was no more automatic breath response.  It was pretty damn scary.\n\nThe top was suboxone, a relative of Narcan (naloxone), which was being prescribed to a friend to wean them off the high doses of oxycodone they were on due to back surgery.  It comes in like a Listerine breath strip, where you hold it in your mouth for ten minutes then spit it out.  He said \"maybe take half, one is probably too much\".  Thinking I was playing it safe, I took 1/4th.  After an hour I was heavily feeling it.  After two, I was absolutely bombed.  After that, I started getting the cold sweats and vomiting if I took even one sip of water.  No chance I could get food down.  I had to call in sick to work.  I was obliterated for 48 hours, and feeling the effects for another 24.  It was insane, and nobody I've talked to has experienced similar with that substance.  I eventually tried it again, but only taking 1/16th of a strip.  That would leave me feeling like I'd eaten a fistful of Vicodin for 24 hours or more.\n\nIt was just crazy to me that people were being prescribed a whole strip every day, when I was taking like 30+ mgs of oxy every day for a couple years and 1/16th of a strip fucked me up that bad.  It would have killed people that didn't have a tolerance easily.  It really put fentanyl and the opiate crisis in perspective for me, one most people on the outskirts wouldn't have.  I was able to walk away from all that, and I cannot feel worse for people who unknowingly get sucked into that world.  A doctor is telling them it's okay, few people would stand a chance against drugs that strong.\n\nEdit: oh fuck off with the downvotes.  Sorry for sharing my personal experience with Narcan analogues and opiates in a thread about Narcan and opiates.",

Which tends to upset most people lol.\n\nUnlike the police who love slamming all the narcan they can into a person, we titrate to ensure the person is breathing, they can remain sleepy and \"less\" responsive, but in EMS we have a strict rule when it comes to ABC's (Airway, Breathing, and Circulation)\nAir goes in and out, blood goes round and round, any deviation must be addressed.\n\nBut nothing says \"wake up the person who will certaintly be pissed you ruined their high until you explain to them they were dying but might sit up and deck me in the face first\"",

Do u ever see someone basically passed out and check if u think it might get worse or can u tell that they're more unlikely to die? I guess I'm wondering if u can tell a difference\n\nThx for your answer btw!",

                                    "comment": "So the on scene process is basically as follows for a call like this:\n\nBSI check and scene safety evaluation (continually assessd to ensure provider safety)\n\nLocate patient\n\nInitial assessment (Are they breathing, if yes, is it adequate for sustaining life.  Rate, depth, and equal chest rise and fall.  If no, do they have a pulse, if yes provide rescue breathing through BVM [bag valve mask] with high flow oxygen, if no begin CPR and follow the appropriate ACLS algorithm based on monitor readouts (for ALS providers).\n\nOnce ABC's are covered you have a patient who is critically ill, but now stabilized through direct interventions.  Now we begin using our deductive reasoning and knowledge to attempt to figure out WHY the patient is the way they are.  If they can tell us that's awesome, but if not in this instance we'd have immediately noted the reduced respiratory rate/drive or depth.  Then a pupil assessment may present pinpoint pupils, which is a positive sign for opiod overdose, other scene eveidence may appear, such as the actual drug or needles or the patient may use fentanyl patches for pain and have left one on an applied another causing overdose.  In which case we evaluate and stop anything that may CONTINUE to cause exposure and remove it.\n\nThen we begin treatment considerations.  If they're breathing.... okayish (rate of 10 or more with good equal depth) we may just support vitals and run to the hospital.\nIf their SpO2 is trash and they weren't even trying to breathe we'll absolutely be bagging them and probably hit them with Narcan just to make them breathe on their own.  If it seems to be a case of accidental overdose by an opiod \"Naive\" patient (grandma took too many pain pills cause she forgot) we'll consider waking them up by giving them a full dose via IV.  If they look like the kinda person who might stab us for waking them up we'll give them enough to rouse some responsiveness but not snap them back to reality (ope there goes gravity)\n\nThen it's just a balancing act to keep them hemodynamically stable to the hospital.  If they OD'd hard enough they'll be on a narcan drip in the hospital till they flush their system.  Also if they're addicted or dependent they'll get low doses to ensure they don't withdrawl but not enough to put them back in the toilet.\n\nThat's the gist, but there is always small differences.  We always treat a patient with their care and safety in mind, and for some the best care that we can give them is to let them be sedated to avoid hostility because while we appreciate the protection the police give us, we really don't like seeing our patients get hurt by them or mistreated, or having to sicc the police on them cause they tried to beat up my partner lol.  If we ooopsie and wake an angry person up we always try to descalate and explain what's going on, but think about being brought out of a super deep sleep to see 2-5 people you have literally never met before who are crouched over you staring at you and one guy has a noodle in your arm and another has a big plastic mask over your face that is pushing air into your lungs.  Easy to see why people can wake up pissed and scared now?",

In general, one can use two-thirds of the initial effective dose of naloxone (0.1 to 6 mg/hr) as a bolus every 60 minutes, or one can administer one-half of the initial bolus dose 15 minutes after starting the continuous IV infusion; this maintains a consistently high dose of naloxone.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441910/",

I've been doing the job you want to do for over a decade. In Appalachia. Yes, that Appalachia, the epicenter of the opioid epidemic! The fact that you're commenting about the half life of drugs, and not the duration of action or peak effect (y'know, the time when they're causing respiratory depression, not when they're just sitting in your kidneys or liver) tells me virtually all I need to know about your pharmacogical knowledge. Did they lower the standards for your class so they could push out more medics during the post-covid shortage? \n\n\nWould you like to hazard a guess as to what the duration of action of narcan is? It's 60 mins. How about the duration of action and peak effect of fentanyl? God would I love to be there to watch you tie yourself in knots when you realize narcan's duration of action has fentanyl covered. It also has crushed intranasal oxy and hydro covered! And as heroin is shorter than either, that pretty much covers the vast majority of opiate abuse overdoses (props for picking out one actual exception in methadone though!). As you can see, this certainly doesn't allow for the assertion of \"many\" patients requiring subsequent doses of narcan, unless you just have zero fucks for writing for comprehension or statistical accuracy. Back to class, my sweet summer child. Winter is coming, and you're going to harm people. \n\nAnd now that you know this, don't lie to your patients. We're coming into these people's homes and expecting them to trust that we know what we're doing and can help them. If you tell them they'll overdose again when the narcan wears off, and then they refuse transport and have zero issues, as they're 98.87% likely to do, they're not going trust you (and neither will their friends they tell) when you actually manage to spout out some accurate and important information about their health.\n\n\nNow scurry on back to your instructor who hasn't worked a truck since the pill era, tell em the salty old street medic was [mean to you](https://media.tenor.com/lXEb9qhwKh0AAAAC/heidi-klum-fake-tears.gif), and pray that you get a preceptor like me to make you useful as a provider of prehospital medical care.",

I gave explicit rationale regarding the dosing requirements to NEED to redose narcan.  Referring to the duration, mechansim of action, peak and onset is great and all but \"Duration\" is an expectation and can vary greatly in both effect and what it \"looks\" like in a patient. And this is nuance that lay people don't understand or know how to differentiate.\n\nHalf life is easy, it's how long before half a substance is metabolised and removed from the body, which many people can understand that generally if you have only half of something it becomes less potent and therefore less effective.  You say not to \"lie\" to patients but you're using metrics that vary too far in either direction as the basis for what may or may not be a highly toxic overdose event.\n\nSecondly, you're not a doc.  Neither am I, if you want to clear your patients and let them be that's cool.  But that doesn't discredit that I know when grandma forgot 3 of her fentanyl 100mcg/hr patches on for the past 3 days may need to go into the hospital for a lil bit to clean out her system.  Which was the sort of situation I'm refering to, since the vast majorty of SEVERE overdoses are done accidentally and with regulated medication not street drugs.\n\nI'd further advise poviding actual sourcing for claims you make when arguing from a standpoint like this, if somebody gets the wrong idea as a weekend warrior and administers narcan without following up with EMS because \"most people who overdose won't experience secondary effects once the narcan wears off\" well maybe this is the one \"not most\" time.  Given the only source you provided during any of this was a single  dramatic article while I gave both research and informational pieces from what is considrered the forefront of updated medical knowledge I'm going to be skeptical about your sourcing and education.\n\nHowever if you are a medic as you claim then I still appreciate your input and feedback, and thank you for being a provider in a world that tends to not really care about this field.\n\nAlso since you asked fentanyl has a duration of action of also about 60minutes, however a large toxic exposure of any and all forms of opiods can cause a buildup due to the fact that opiods are mostly metabolised in the liver.  So elderly, or patients with advanced conditions relating to the hepatic system are far more at risk than your average druggy.  But this buffer effect is also real for those in younger ages which is why knowing the approximate amount of a substance a patient used is key in determining if transport will be needed vs just advised.\n\nSee in my only call where a patient overdosed to the point we HAD to call medcontrol for orders to have the patient taken to a facility was when he (in a suicide attempt) took a large quantity of oxycodone.  When we relayed the fact the patient was now alert and refusing transport to the doc on call and we provided information as to the amount of drug \"stated\" taken.  The doc said \"he has to come in\" and that was that.\n\nYou're arguing if it's common, no it's not common.  Easy answer, I'm arguing if it happens, which yes it does and in areas I've serviced it's happening more and more frequently. I'd never really inteded on getting into the nuance because I'm hoping to simply help laypeople understand the what, how and why we do things. I've seen cops slam patients with Narcan, now they're awake and non compliant but able to refuse without me getting an idea on what poor buddy took, then it turns out he stole some fent patches froma local pharmacy and has 2 of them on him right now, or he shot up his entire supply before the cops rolled in and now since I can't kidnap him, have no warrant to get somebody to search the place, and he wont tell me how much he took,  I leave and come find his body 3 days later.  Any service I've worked with we always air on the side of caution even if we have a good guess as to how things will play out.\n\nYou say I'm going to hurt patients, but generally if you can take the time to explain this to them they just transport and given that narcan can last for a fair while, unless you're running to the styx  we don't genrally have to redose them, but the facility will.  Nowhere on this planet does hitting somebody with narcan (unless allergic) hurt somebody.  Seen docs, nurses, medics just do it because they \"suspect\" opiod involvment but don't know and when it doesn't work we just shrug and keep trying to figure out what variety of k2 they actually used, usually horse tranqs at that point but I digress.",

You told people narcan had to be readministered for recurrent overdose in many patients. I said nah \"many\" is bullshit, you rebutted with useless information. I pointed out you had no clue what you were talking about, now here you are talking about octagenarians and other outliers with fenty patches instead of \"Many\"??? Big backpedal energy you've got there. I've been around the block hundreds of times, you don't need to try to impress me with your once every couple of years cases that we all know don't represent the average patient population the readers of this comment thread are envisioning. Please be intellectually honest on that point. \n\nAnd you've also now provided an example in which you violated a patient's rights, and falsely imprisoned them on the word of a physician! Psychiatric holds are up to the legal system, not medical personnel. Call law enforcement for suicidal ideations, not physicians. You're lucky that patient didn't know the law better, you opened yourself up to criminal liability. You probably shouldn't tell anyone else about that, but do look into enrolling in LegalShield. You're a bit too big for your britches and I sense you're one of the ones who may need it. \n\nI don't give two shits about your desire for sources, I learned these facts from lectures with physicians and if I had the time or fucks to give to educate idiots, I'd be an instructor. But thank you for confirming I was right. The simple fact that it you wrote such a lengthy reply, yet aren't trying to drown me with sources telling me I'm wrong tells me all I need to know: You broke out your bestest Google-fu, found out I knew what I was talking about, and now you're here grasping at geriatric straws and rare cases to try to pretend you're not a \ud83e\udd21\n\nNobody said anything about narcan doing harm, it's the dishonesty that is harmful. Do you even have a medical ethics course? Also, if you need to use narcan diagnostically, you're either not very good at assessing for opiate overdose, or have wasted time you could have used providing necessary and relevant care to that patient. If you're going to work the streets, you'll have 4 total hands. Knowing what to do with them, and when, is a big part of EMS. If you want to work in a hospital, then go for the pointless narcan. You, my friend, will be surrounded by more competent people to do the important things. \n\nYou've got a lot to learn, and above all is respect for your patients. Respect them enough to learn how to actually help them, respect them enough to not lie to them, and definitely respect them enough to know their rights. I don't want your platitudes or thanks, I want your competency and honesty. Eat all of the humble pie you can, and there's an outside chance you won't be the kid nobody wants to work with.

If you slam it too quickly that's when you start having problems.\n\nAlso, it is a super common misconception that everyone waking up violent is doing so because they are angry their high was wrecked. Yes, some people get annoyed. That usually happens right after they realize what happens. That's not why they wake up swinging.\n\nWhen you overdose on an opioid, it kills your respiratory drive. Your breathing slows down and eventually stops and that's how you die. During that time before it stops, you may only breathe 1 or 2 times a minute. The body is only getting a tiny fraction of the oxygen it needs, so it stops sending it literally everywhere except for the brain stem, which operates the bare minimum to stay alive. There's no reasoning ability, it's basically an animal brain. If the brain and body aren't properly oxygenated before waking back up, the narcan kicks in but the brain is still oxygen deprived. In a sense (and I'm not trying to sound insensitive, I'm talking at a base, simple level) what is waking up is not human yet. So it's like a hurt animal opening its eyes and seeing a bunch of unfamiliar strangers standing around it. There's no ability to reason or recognize what's happening, they just think they're in danger and feel the need to protect themselves. Because the brain literally isn't able to function yet due to lack of oxygen.\n\nI love making sure my patients are fully oxygenated and waking them up nice and slowly and no one (yet) has ever woken up swinging at me. Waking someone up from an overdose is the most incredible experience, one minute theyre almost dead and 2 minues later they're sitting up talking to you. I hate that people struggle with addiction and I never wish an overdose on anyone, but reviving overdosed patients never gets old. It is fascinating.",

But there is nothing that I love more than helping the people that truly need me, whether they're having a stroke, a heart attack, in cardiac arrest, overdosed, or some other genuine emergency. I don't work full time as an EMT anymore and when I look back on my years on the ambulance all I wish is that just one person I revived with narcan is now living a clean, sober, happy life and that by letting them live another day I gave them another chance that they eventually took.

Now a $5 bag of Fentanyl is more or less always good because of its wide availability and affordability (on the dealer end) and it\u2019ll keep you for longer.\n\nAs far as the tranquilizer, I think there\u2019s a market for it in Puerto Rico, at least I read that, but virtually none in the Continental U.S., and so I assume it\u2019s a dirt cheap way to add a serious punch to your product.",

I'm not a scientist or Healthcare provider, but there's zero doubt in my mind when I use Narcan on someone, it's the most abrupt and terrifying wake up that person will ever experience.  EMTs should be educated on the facts, instead of silly ideas like \"they're mad you ruined their high\" or \"they may up upset\".  Imagine how distressed and confused you'd be if you just woke up from the edge of death, confused and scared.",

The details throughout her responses were consistent with someone who has the experience of an EMT (I'm a bit familiar with the vocab). She also was not being overly desparaging of the victim or addicts as a whole or going out of her way to use anti addict rhetoric like u tend to hear those shitty people use.\n\nI mean it's possible she was lying but it was quite the commitment. I'm curious now, looking back with the angle of someone who's lying what it would look like\n\nThat said, that guy who's said their instructor told them that anecdote, people who go into emergency medical are usually quite empathetic which can be seen from some EMTs who've responded in this post and they are also NOT doing it for the pay or the glory. A cop would definitely lie or exaggerate about that sort of thing, paramedic, not so much. If they hated addicts I think it would be from direct experience and they probably wouldn't have started out hating addicts\n\nI think it's funny that u don't think that something like this has ever been said. Like a ton of people who become consumed with addiction are people who've been dealt shit hand after shit hand and understandibly couldn't cope. Then there's other people who become wrapped up in addiction who have always been entitled pieces of shit and the Bank of Mommy&amp;Daddy just bailed their sorry asses out their whole lives, those people become addicts too.\n\nNot to mention, I've said some pretty inaccurate things when under the influence and it just comes out like that. I feel if I was in that position, suddenly regaining full consciousness after near death \"why didn't you just let me die\" which is what I would personally feel, might come out like \"why did you ruin it for me\"\n\nAnyway, just some thoughts, thx for reading my novel",

About 8 years ago I was shoplifting stuff and selling it to get money for heroin. Working a crappy waitress job and going straight to the dealer each night with my cash tips. Five or so years ago I did heroin for the last time. Blacked out with the needle still in my arm and woke up an unknown number of hours later so sick. Must have puked for a solid 24 hours. Unexpected fentanyl. I would have benefited from Narcan and absolutely could have died, and there are a lot of people out there who would have said I was just a useless piece of shit and the world would be better off. I take care of those kinds of people now. I tuck their moms and dads and grandparents in with warm blankets and make sure they're comfortable before we put them to sleep for surgery. And they'll never know.\n\nIt's funny though, how easy it is to stay off drugs when you actually have something worth living for. I lucked out being able to pay for school through a combination of federal student loans and the generosity of family members who gave me a place to live and drove me to class. I got on Suboxone to stave off the physical withdrawals, switched to Sublocade when I finally had health insurance, and the Sublocade led to sobriety. People love to say that medications like Suboxone are \"just trading one drug for another,\" but being given the luxury of time without the worry about withdrawals means that you can start to heal. You make new habits. You're not waking up dopesick every day and you don't have to risk arrest and/or death to get there. You find reasons to enjoy life that don't involve drugs. And when you're ready, if you're lucky enough to have access to it, a longer-acting form like Sublocade will allow you to gradually move on from the physical dependence. I remember a time when I couldn't even imagine living my life without some kind of chemical substance to give me the comfort and happiness that I wasn't getting from my real life. Shockingly enough, having a degree and a career and things to look forward to means I'm no longer seeking ways to fill that void.",

And even now, the idea that nurses are \"wealthy\" is frankly laughable. Regardless of whatever the news has been telling you about COVID travel nurses, the vast majority of us don't make anywhere near that much. My dealer had already bought the product from his dealer, who bought it from his dealer, who bought it from his dealer, who bought it from his dealer, and at some point I'm sure it came from a Mexican cartel before it was repeatedly cut with various substances and would have been sold to someone eventually, but somehow that's MY fault personally? The cartel had their money long before I entered the equation.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for your loss, but none of that is really relevant to the context of Narcan saving lives and the issue that there are some who think that people should be allowed to die rather than treated during an overdose because they were never going to move past their addiction anyway. You're allowed to be angry at whoever you want and think whatever you want, but if someone thinks that people shouldn't be given Narcan and should be allowed to die instead, then I'm allowed to think they're a piece of shit. And they can think that I'm a piece of shit, but to be honest with you I just don't care.\n\nAnd just fyi, if you'd like to point fingers for how large and powerful the cartels have gotten then there are much better places to start.",

Whatever else shit gets cut with, underneath it's an opiate, and the opiate is the problem.\n\nThere are three basic problems with opiates: \n\none, it's physically addictive to some percentage of people, which means that those people's bodies are able to essentially add the opiate to the list of things it's monitoring the levels of and alerting when it's too low. It makes alarms on the level of \"we're starving\" or \"we can't breathe,\" which are intended by nature to be impossible to ignore. Last I heard, about 25% of people are prone to opiate addiction, and different people have different tolerance, so you can do it recreationally for a while and be fine and then find that you're addicted. \n\ntwo, straight cold turkey withdrawal can kill you, so you have to figure out how to wean off it by down-dosing (or switching to a substitute like methadone, which is like switching from food to dogfood - I'll keep you alive, but it's not the same). Having the thing you're addicted to in your house and only taking a little is... Not easy.\n\nthree, opiates feel like home, with your dog and your mom and a nice fire and money in the bank and everything is just content. If your life is shitty and you're living somewhere insecure and there's violence all around you and you have just enough money for food or the feeling of home and safe... Well, you can see why you see people lying in a gutter full of vomit with a contented smile on their face.\n\nThe biggest problem with fentanyl is that it's incredibly low-dose, so a tiny spec is the equivalent of a good-size dose of heroin, for example. It's incredibly easy to overdose. \n\nAnd, if you've got a batch of really low-quality drugs of whatever kind, and you've got no moral compass, you can spice it up a bit with a tiny amount of opiate; the problem being that fentanyl doesn't spread out evenly, so if you put a tiny amount in a baggy of cocaine, someone doing the cocaine isn't getting an even amount of fentanyl with every line, they're getting a bunch of lines of crappy coke and then one line with enough fentanyl to kill them.\n\nLastly, lots of opioids being sold on the street are actual prescription drugs, made into pill form with reassuring codes stamped into them, so people take them thinking \"great, it's official drugs, it won't kill me\" but it's still opium under the hood.",

I used to get actual heroin (I tested it many times), but eventually actual heroin completely disappeared. I was able to get a fent/heroin mix for a little, but demand for heroin took a nosedive once you were hooked on fent.\n\n\nWhen I used heroin I could use 4 bags (.4g) in the morning, 2 bags (.2g) in the afternoon, and 2 bags in the evening. I never went through withdrawal, and I was vibing. It cost me about $25 a day due to buying in bulk.\n\n\nWhen it became heroin the bags shrunk from .1g to .3-.5g and I would have to do 8 bags of fent to just feel okay, but the thing with fent is that you start going into withdrawal within the hour. I ended up using 3-4 bundles (14 bags a bundle, $100 per bundle) per day ... And I would be in constant withdrawal.\n\n\nSince fent was so shitty at keeping you high they started putting \"tranq\" to knock you out for hours. Now most people have the wrong idea of what heroin does ... For me it made me super energetic and motivated.\n\n\nThe first time I had tranq (unknowingly) I legit projectile vomited 30 feet or so nonstop for an hour. I started \"nodding\" which I never did. It was awful. There was no high, just an inability to move.",

I am a really blunt (in a positive way) person so I have zero problem answering even the most fucked up question honestly.\n\n\n&gt;What are ur thoughts on the legally dispensed morphine I think it is?\n\n\nI am 100% for this, but with some obvious rules in place. The Netherlands has a similar program and their addiction rates have decreased and, more importantly, their OD rates have decreased. I believe that most problems of addiction come from drugs being illegal; as long as you aren't hurting anyone else directly then you should be able to do what you want with your body.\n\n\nI firmly believe alcohol is the most dangerous drug in existence. You can die from long term use (you can't from actual heroin) and you can die from the withdrawal (you can't with actual heroin). I always felt bad about alcoholics because it is so ingrained into our society. How they can quit while driving by their \"dealers\" 10x a day is beyond me. \n\n\n&gt;redose might also overdue it due to wd symptoms\n\n\nIt is even worse than that. Fent has an incredibly small threshold between enjoyable and dead that an extremely experienced user can OD and die from 1/10th of what they normally use.\n\n\n&gt; Would u say a lot of ppl had similar effects from heroin?\n\n\nWith actual heroin, which I don't believe you can get now, it really depends on what you want out of it. I am incredibly unique in the sense that I didn't become addicted to heroin until my 30s, I was addicted to pharma opiates since 27. My brain was fully developed, and I remember an adult life without being high. \n\n\nI was in a car accident when I broke both my legs, my talus joint shattered, and my elbow shattered. I had to relearn how to walk. Right when I was getting to the spot of stopping the opiates due to the pain I ended up in a relationship with a woman who was the most manipulative, selfish, self serving, narcissist who has a fear of being alone. She convinced me that I was utterly worthless and no one likes me except her. She really fucked with my mental state so I leaned into the opiates to feel better about myself. This resulted in me not seeing her emotional abuse, lying, and cheating for 11 years.\n\n\nThe moment we split I quit, and have NEVER had the desire to use. I never thought something like that could happen to me as I was always extremely confident and had pretty good luck with women. I firmly believe if I never met her, or wasn't a coward and broke up with her the million times I wanted to, I wouldn't have become an addict.\n\n\nResearch is starting to show that addiction has a lot to do with being lonely and unfulfilled. I wasn't those things in my early adult life, but I was lonely after my car accident. I ended up settling when I started my relationship with my ex because I was lonely. It was just a lot of bad luck where I met someone who took advantage of my weakened mental state.\n\n\nWe were together for 11 years and she admitted she never loved me, and was only with me for companionship.",

I personally never liked being with others and being around others often made me want to use because of the social anxiety. I wanted to get into addictions work as a career but I just can't accept that concept and preach it. In a sense trauma from childhood made me want to stay away from others as a protective mechanism so maybe that's why it's different for me and if I valued and loved myself, maybe I wouldn't be anxious around others? Or maybe I have ASD which I strongly suspect.\n\nAnyway, I think I've read your comment about her in the past, it really sounds familiar. I'm going to creep u later (not in a bad way) and see if we follow similar subs. I remember thinking \"holy fuck, what a horrible fucking cunt\" and how I wanted updates like who is she, what is she doing now, what's going on in a person's life to make them like that.

Also, at the same point, you mention that childhood trauma keeps you from forming companionship bonds which might be the reason you use moreso.\n\n\nI absolutely believe that people who love themselves do not become addicts. I thought I loved myself while using, but it was just a trick I played on myself.  My ex- wife made sure I didn't view myself in a positive light. The moment I was away from her I have had no desire to use nor a daydream to use. \n\n\n\nHaha! Creep away!

Yeah, the only outlet for my anger and resentment that I have towards her; and towards myself for being an addict and dulling my senses to see her for who she is. Except for zeal for dominating sex. \n\n\n&gt;When's the custody hearing?\n\n\nI'm waiting for her to be found guilty of her DWI/child endangerment before really kicking it into high gear. Right now she can't drive with him, and her parents are with her all of the time. I had an emergency injection which gave me sole custody for a month and a half where she didn't even attempt to see/talk to him. \n\n\n&gt;I hope you've got all the documentation of her shitty attitude in text or email, etc\n\n\nI have so much documentation, but it is mostly focused on her lies and refusal to coparent.\n\n\n&gt;Is karma getting her in some way at least \n\n\nHonestly I think her karma is just that she has to be her. According to my therapist she thinks she might have histrionic/narcissistic personality disorder. She doesn't have enough self-reflection to see where she is wrong so I doubt she will ever realize how much of a shitty person she is. I only have one regret in life : I broke up with her a few weeks into our relationship when I had a moment of clarity, but a few weeks later she texted me. I was lonely so I became swirled up again, unfortunately. I love my son to death, but I honestly believe my personality and influence is 95% of him and that I would still have him with a different woman.\n\n\nThe most karma she is getting is \"falling in love\" with any fool she lets fuck her, but they always leave. Unfortunately she parades these dudes around my son.\n\n\n&gt; What does she do for work if u don't mind me asking? Was she good looking? How fucked up was her childhood?\n\n\nShe *was* a Financial Advisor (+10 million limit to work with her) for a huge financial company. She had the perfect job as it was work from home and very flexible schedule (4 day work weeks, set own schedule, etc) but she was fired a month or so prior to the DWI which I still do not have the full story too. She was \"cheating\" (in constant contact and sending nudies) to one of her clients, but he randomly asked to be removed from her list so it might have something to do with that.\n\n\nHer face was average, but when we met she had an amazing body. Slender, long legs, full breasts, but she was the laziest, most self lover I ever had. We quickly went to a dead bedroom, and I leaned into opiates to \"self castrate\" myself. No foreplay, no moans, no movements, no sexy talk or clothes or anything. During the entirety of our relationship people would mention that while she was cute she was a few levels lower than my normal type. At the time I didn't give it much thought and just thought people were being kind (in a mean way). Once I truly saw her for who she is I can't believe I gave her the type of day, but I always valued body above face.\n\n\nShe actually had the best childhood anyone could ask for. Parents still together, parents still bang. Sure, her Mom is completely overbearing (the worst I have ever seen) but I always thought that was because she sensed her true nature.\n\n\nShe just happens to be the type of person that any slight towards her is the worst thing you could ever do to her (she once YELLED at me for locking the door before she got to her car when we lived apart) while she always has a justification for her shitty behavior.\n\n\nWorst part is I would get back with her and play the role of a dutiful, romantic, passionate husband if it meant I was able to be with my son 100% of the time. Maybe that is setting myself up for a relapse, but I have always been good at compartmentalizing so my urge to keep my son safe would make me pretend to be the greatest fucking husband ever. I haven't told her this, obviously.",

I was reading one of his ER summaries and I read that either paramedics or the ER administered Narcan. He was unresponsive when paramedics arrived and I wasn't on scene yet. Is this something that happens often when someone is unresponsive and paramedics are called? My husband does not take opiates, does not do ahy drugs. He smokes pot only. why would they administer Narcan?",

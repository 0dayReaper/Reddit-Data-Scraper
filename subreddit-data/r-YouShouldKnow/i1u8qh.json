    "postText": "My mom was the type of person who HATED pictures. She thought she was ugly so she avoided them like the plague. Most memories I have involve her behind the camera, not in front of it.\n\nShe passed away unexpectedly 5 years ago, yesterday was the anniversary, and when she died my siblings and I combed through family photos, online pictures, anything we could think of to find some way to see our mom again. There are only 3, two of which are a side view and the other is blurry. \n\nI keep her driver\u2019s license because it\u2019s the only head-on, smiling picture I have to remember her by. \n\nPlease don\u2019t avoid taking pictures if you have children. Because I promise you we do not see ugly, we do not see fat, we do not see flaws...we see our parents, our mommy, the person we love so much and will miss so much when you pass. Let us have a way to look at you again even after you\u2019re gone.\n\nEdit: because of this post, a beautiful person offered to clear up the only blurry photo of my mom I was left with. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ow37QNG) it is! Thank you Reddit, from the bottom of my heart thank you",

I just realized that I actively shy away from pictures, and that photos of many places I've been to or things I've done (trips, celebrations etc.) don't have me in them at all. This post will definitely change that, flaws be damned! Thank you.",

I didn't lose him terribly young, but I never got to know him as I became an adult, the biggest thing I mourn. But I try to live my best for him, and get out in nature as often as I can (relatively easy living near the adirondacks hehe). I'm also sure to spoil my \"nieces\" like he used to me, when I have them. He lives on in certain ways",

Another great piece of advice I've read is to film yourself talking about your life story - what you know about your parents and grandparents (names, places they lived, where they worked) as well as the same details for you, and anything else of interest or just details of who you are.  Pets you owned, why you chose living in X over Y, why you chose the names you gave your kids, things you're proud of etc.\n\nIt helps to preserve you, but also your familiar history.  A lot of the every day is lost when someone passes, and some of it can't be regained through documentation or photographs.\n\nBest of luck with the time you have left.  I hope it's blessed, happy, and full of love.",

Talking of them growing up. Talking of being proud of them on weddings, anniversaries, graduations. Make some for every occasion. Graduating college, but also maybe serving 4 years in the military, or such like that. Spread them out, don't knock them all out in 1 day.\n\nIf they are already aged past that, make videos for random days. Just choose random days in the future and make a video/audio. Just you talking about how you hope the day is going well, thinking about what the weather might be like, etc etc. \n\nMy dad did that for me for my wedding. He knew he wouldn't be able to make it, so he made several tapes for me for my wedding congratulating me in his wedding getup ( and also made a separate video for if I married samesex! ), and then made several videos talking about his advice for raising kids/for my kids also. Little 5ish minute videos of him talking to potential future grandkids, telling stories of his life to pass on those memories.\n\nYou don't die when you physically die. You die when the last person who remembers you dies.",

In total, there was 13 people at our house for the party: my parents, my wife's parents, my brother and his wife and their son, and my grandparents, and of course my wife and I and our two kids.  I realized I might get some judgement for having so many people at our house because of Covid.  However, my parents are retired and at home all the time, my grandparents are in their 80s and they don't go anywhere, y brother and his wife are also teachers and they've been strict about staying home, and my wife's parents are able to work from home.  So everyone we had at our house has been quarantining really well since March.\n\nPoint being, to finish my sentence...during my daughter's birthday party I was \"the man behind the camera\".  We have a shared Google Photos drive for the family so everyone can have instant access to pictures no matter when it is and where they are.  As I was uploading all the pictures from my camera to the Google Photos drive, I was only in one of the dozens of pictures.  This thread made me realize I don't want my kids to be grown and realize dad is pretty much never in pictures.",

These companies are literally trying to sell you something so now people have associated this artificial world with real life when that isn\u2019t the case at all.",

I doubt I am alone and is probably one reason for the popularity of color and face filters. So I try to get more taken by others when I get a chance.",

Nothing is cooler than home videos of people just hanging out at birthday parties or gatherings and everyone is more relaxed and comfortable rather then anxious and embarrassed posing for a photo.\n\nI hate photos too but mostly because they are so unnatural, posing and smiling and crap, so fake. 99% of photos are not the real me. Videos on the other hand are me in my natural state just comfortable hanging out.\n\nHow it used to be done in my family is there was a camera and whoever wanted could just grab it and take video as it was recording constantly during a gathering or party and it catches everyone just relaxing.",

But just last week I found a short shaky video I took around 3 years ago that I didnt even remember taking and in it was she, although for just a mere two seconds. I saw her move, saw her facial expressions change, and most importantly: heard her voice again. Let me tell you I ugly cried. Short videos of your loved ones during mundane activities, or simply taken randomly during the day, will one day be your greatest treasure",

    "postText": "\nI save a lot of Tik Tok videos, some of which only being a few secs long, being kinda pointless when it\u2019s just one picture superimposed over some irrelevant video background and some audio playing over it. I have many videos like that in my camera roll for various educational or entertaining purposes. I decided to clean up my videos by just taking a screenshot the important picture(s) of a video but I later realized that the screenshots actually took more space than the video\n\nAnd when I take pictures with my camera or save pictures (not video) from Face book, they are much smaller than my screenshots. Being about 2mb MAX when screenshots were high as 10 even almost 20 MB. I have since deleted lots of videos, some being just useless to me anyways  AND screenshots most being useless too. \n\nALSO ALSO, if you want to screenshot something to repost or share somewhere else, consider using copy and delete so you can just paste the screenshot into FB (may not work for other apps but just manually delete the SS picture afterwards)\n\n\nWHY YSK: You should know this because it can save you lots of storage.",

The fewer colours there are, the fewer numbers you need, so Reddit text posts (mostly black and white, and with a lot of continuous white/black depending on theme), can be highly compressed this way. \n\n(This is all highly simplified, but tldr is that you can compress certain images a lot and text posts tend to be one of them)",

I can't help that.\n\n I was at the peak of an arcing bridge and a truck was at the bottom moving my direction. Since I was at a higher elevation my low beams were still over his eye level. He keep flashing his lights trying to get me to turn my brights off even though they were never on. He then proceeds to turn on a giant led light bar on top of his truck, blinding me. Trying to avoid the truck, I then lost control and flipped my car off the bridge, totaling the car.\n\nLuckily the car landed in the water of the stream below so the impact wasn't bad and I left unscathed other than a couple small cuts from broken glass. The truck just kept on driving. Of course insurance wouldn't cover me. So about a 28,000$ ordeal for doing nothing wrong whatsoever.\n\nPlease don't purposely blind people even if you think they have their brights on.",

If anything they should be making the pass requirements tougher not easier.

Then you have a total of 3 years on a provisional license (2 years on P1 and 1 on P2 after passing a hazard perception test). On you P\u2019s you have to have 0.00% blood alcohol and you\u2019re restricted from driving high-powered vehicles even in factory vehicles (think WRX and V8\u2019s etc). \n\nAnd even with all that, people still don\u2019t know how to merge",

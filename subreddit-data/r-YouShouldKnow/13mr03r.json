    "postText": "Why YSK: A lot of people use the term \u201ctrauma bonding\u201d to mean a bond shared by two (or more) people bonding over shared trauma, or becoming close by talking about trauma together. While this makes intuitive sense, the term actually refers to the bond between an abused person and their abuser.\n\nWhen someone is abused, they may have a psychological trauma response that results in a trauma bond. This is usually caused by an unhealthy attachment, the victim feeling dependent on the abuser, feeling sympathy for the abuser, or the cycle of abuse and positive reinforcement (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it again, you know I love you, right?\u201d).\n\nThis typically manifests as the victim excusing/justifying the abuser\u2019s behaviour, isolating themselves to hide the abuse from outsiders, maintaining hope that the relationship/the abuser\u2019s behaviour will improve, and feeling unable or unwilling to leave despite detriments to the victim\u2019s mental/physical health and wellbeing. Victims also may equate abuse with love and not recognise abusive behaviours as abuse (because \u201cthey still love me\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re doing it because they care\u201d).\n\nMany victims of abuse who form a trauma bond with their abuser find it particularly hard to leave the relationship/remove the abuser from their life, can suffer intense distress when they do leave, and are more likely than non-trauma bonded victims to return to their abuser.\n\nSource: [Verywellmind.com link](https://www.verywellmind.com/trauma-bonding-5207136) plus personal experience\n\nEdit: Removed an inaccurate sentence\n\nEdit 2: A lot of people have mentioned Stockholm Syndrome in the comments and the sentence I removed actually talked about how Stockholm Syndrome is a form of trauma bond. I removed it because a commenter let me know that the validity of Stockholm Syndrome is controversial and I didn\u2019t want the post to include anything inaccurate. I don\u2019t know enough about Stockholm Syndrome to speak on it myself or make a call whether it\u2019s accurate or not so I just removed it, but yes, trauma bonding does look very similar to the idea behind Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nEdit 3: A lot of people have been asking for what the term would be as described in the title (bonding over shared trauma). While no one\u2019s found a completely accurate term, u/magobblie suggested \u201cstress bonding\u201d to describe this, which seems about right, though it\u2019s specific to creating a bond between rabbits who huddle together when exposed to a common stressor.",

You do like, 3 things, and then you level up. But then over time, it takes longer and longer to level up. You might have to do 5 things for the same \"high\" next time. Over time, you are only levelling up every once in a while, and you have to do more and more for a morsel. I imagine that in abusive relationships, something similar happens where over time, you are doing all the hard emotional work for the \"reward\" of a day without being yelled at.\n\nEDIT: actually, it was [this Cracked.com article](https://www.cracked.com/article_18461_5-creepy-ways-video-games-are-trying-to-get-you-addicted.html) that showed me how gambling and online games were becoming the same thing, and I have to think there are more parallels between abuse and casinos in it.",

All these become weighted, dramatic moments because the abuser's mood or reaction will be revealed.\n\nWhat sucks is that you are then dating a slot machine and you have no control over when the handle is pulled, but you will be the recipient of its abuse or reward no matter what.",

But now we know better, and we can be better, without having to resort to spanking at all now!\n\n[Why You Shouldn\u2019t Spank Your Kids and What To Do Instead](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/pediatricians-say-dont-spank-your-kids-heres-why-what-to-do-instead/#:~:text=Research%20over%20the%20last%2020,disorders%20and%20impaired%20brain%20development.)\n\n&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a strong statement in 2018, advising parents not to spank their children, based on a growing pile of studies showing that the disciplinary technique does more harm than good.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe new AAP statement includes data that show that kids who were spanked in their early years were more likely to be more defiant, show more aggressive behavior later in preschool and school and have increased risk for mental health disorders and lower self-esteem,\u201d says pediatrician Karen Estrella, MD.\n&gt;&gt;Research over the last 20 years has demonstrated that spanking increases aggression in young children and is ineffective in changing their undesirable behavior, the AAP says. Studies have also linked spanking to an increased risk of mental health disorders and impaired brain development.\n\nI think most parents try to do what is best and what they know. There's no judgement for parents who are doing the best they can. I think a lot of parents are actually relieved to find that there are methods of discipline and teaching that are more effective than spanking, so they feel vindicated *not* hitting their child.\n\nI remember growing up, and even know, some people claim hitting children would solve our problems, or blame parents \"sparing the rod\" and it's crazy how much pressure parents can get from outside to hit their own kids!",

It definitely sounds more like what it is than trauma bonding does. The word bonding to me having an inherently positive connotation, and attachment have a more neutral or clinical connotation.\n\nSometimes the challenge is we hear and perceive the meaning of words differently. Or how something \"sounds\" affects how it's understood and relayed. And sometimes something being catchy or widely misused creates a public misunderstanding that just becomes passive misinformation that is a big problem for people to break down over time.\n\nLike how people still refer to multiple personality disorder (now dissociative personality disorder) as schizophrenia because of a kind of self sustaining incorrect usage, perpetuates often through movies and shows.\n\nIt's odd, right? How a little bit of misperception can cause a lot of issues. Or how we hear and perceive words and phrases differently?",

I think probably a lot of it is in our day to day life, functionally we use words so much more often than we talk about what words mean.\n\nWhich makes sense.

Changing norms, new technology, global culture, near universal communication. So it kind of pushes us towards needing those discussions about what certain things mean that simply weren't necessary in the past.\n\nSo, we end up with a lot more conflicts associated with intended/accepted meanings of words as a result. As interesting a problem as it is frustrating.",

You may even unconsciously attempt to turn a good relationship *into* an abusive one by altering your behaviour to induce abusive behaviour in a partner, or to be abusive to a partner.\n\nIt's something that you're unlikely able to recognize and resolve in yourself, and professional counselling might be in order.

They described it as a bond that *usually* occurred between the victim and perpetrator, but it seems that some psychologists do not use the term exclusively to refer to that single relationship. Some use it to also refer to victims of trauma bonding over their trauma. \n\nLike all theories, there are no universal rules that require every doctor or scientist to follow them. However, when it\u2019s a very well backed up theory they typically do. In the case of trauma bonding; there is significant evidence and support that backs up the theory, however it\u2019s not been 100% proven, as is the nature of psychology (and science in general). \n\nOf the 5 studies I\u2019ve read on trauma bonding, these are the ones that I personally believe to be good reads:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8193053/\n\nhttps://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1059&amp;context=utk_gradthes\n\nhttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41339659.pdf",

A lot of the jargon of specialized fields gets misused by the muggles and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s irritating, but the muggles are only looking for an expedient way to say what they\u2019re thinking. \n\nIf someone could come up with an official term for sharing a traumatic experience with someone and bonding over it (which is a mouthful), then the term \u201ctrauma bond\u201d could retain its original meaning described by OP. \n\nBut since you can\u2019t control language, I\u2019d say it\u2019s already too late and people are going to say trauma bond in the way that sounds right to them, even if it\u2019s not the proper term in the mental health field. \n\nOCD definitely gets misused a lot, but I\u2019ve seen more and more pushback lately informing people what it really is like to have OCD and how having a neat and tidy desk at work is not what OCD is and calling it that is disrespectful to those who actually have the disorder.",

What these people mean is \"I don't do compassion and couldn't care less about what you have overcome,\" which they feel is justified because \"trauma bonding\" has a deservedly negative connotation.\n\nThe toxic positivity runs so very deep. In a vacuum, as others have suggested, it's *theoretically* okay to use \"trauma bonding\" to mean \"compassionate connection over past traumas.\" In practice, this is simply confusing for ESL folk and an open opportunity for toxic positivity.\n\nLet's lock this term down, please.",

He's not directly abusive, violent, or cruel, but he's not affectionate, doesn't invest in understanding or affirming her, and his sexual behaviors with her cause her to feel demeaned and triggered. She consents--this isn't sexual assault--but there's no love in it, and she's in tears afterward. He doesn't know she cries, or that she feels humiliated by it. She doesn't tell him; she's told me about it, but with him she plays a part that everything is fine. \n\nThis is what I'm trying to figure out: she wants to leave him, but for months now she hasn't moved an inch toward doing so. She still keeps dates with him, going over to see him, knowing all the way what's expected and what she'll go though. He thinks they're doing fine because she can't speak up about her feelings, and she's not brave enough (is that the right word?) to go through with a breakup. I'm trying to understand, is that what a trauma bond is like? Is she \"frozen\" in her pattern with him because if trauma? I honestly don't know if she's incapable of choosing her way out, or if she *is* making a choice, daily, to continue in her relationship with him. Why can't she get free of him, and find a better partner? \n\nI'm asking respectfully for insight, because I don't want to victim-blame or to have hurtful misunderstandings. I really want to know what keeps her attached to him, when she could be done with this in an hour at any point that she decided to tell him, \"We're done, I'm moving on, I don't want to see you anymore.\" What blocks her from taking that step? Does she *choose* to continue, or do trauma bonds inhibit someone's choice, even though she's wanted to be free of him for months?",

You all bond through the *shared* stress/trauma you are going through **every day** at work - and that's experiences that people who have *never* been through the same situation ever could understand. It's just too far away from their life and what they go through for them to be able to even imagine what it must be like. It's already a proposed term for what you're describing, and what OP is rightfully saying *\"trauma bonding\"* is **not**. So why not roll with it? :)",

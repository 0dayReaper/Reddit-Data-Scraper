    "postText": "Why YSK: Water heaters use an anode rod to attract and remove sediments from the water being heated. An anode rod will corrode and deteriorate over time until it\u2019s no longer capable of functioning and has to be replaced. This part literally sacrifices itself to keep the tank in optimal condition. That\u2019s why it\u2019s also referred to as a sacrificial anode. Without it, the water tank would start corroding from the inside out which would eventually result in a severe leak at the bottom.\n\nAfter the anode rod deteriorates, the tank will begin corroding. This is the reason water heaters typically only last 5-15 years. If you replace the rod every few years (cheap and easy), it will extend the life of water heater by decades.\n\n[Info on how to replace.](https://www.waterheaterhub.com/water-heater-anode-rod-replacement/)",

            "comment": "I have done it twice (different water heaters). The anode rod was extremely hard to turn on both of them. I used an impact socket and breaker bar, but still I wasn't able to make it turn by hand, had to use an impact gun.\n\nYou should also know that if you perceive a \"rotten egg\"  ( hydrogen sulfide gas ) smell from the heated water, this is likely caused by bacteria. This issue can be reduced or eliminated by replacing the magnesium anode with an aluminum-zinc anode.\n\nEdit: My theory is that manufacturers tighten the anode to an extreme torque on purpose to discourage people from replacing it, so they can keep selling new water heaters.\n\nThanks for the gold!",

The enamel is brittle (like on an enamel camping mug) if the steel flexes the enamel cracks and exposes the steel to the water.  Using big torques to turn plumbing fittings or anodes will cause the steel to flex and the enamel to cracks.  At least that the Ozy story.",

This low threshold for scent is also why it's added to natural gas for leak detection.\n\nIn short, there are a few things that could be causing this smell, and while **none** of them are _good_ some are bad enough to warrant having someone come out to have a look.",

Im talking 2-3 feet of leverage. You\u2019ll likely need someone to hold the tank too. I wouldnt even go to a customers house to do this without my impact wrench, (which has 1200 ft/lbs and still takes 2-3 second to get it to budge.) If the sucker is going to put up a fight, i may not even be able to remove it myself, as i wouldnt be able to reach far enough on a breaker bar while holding the heater. DO NOT say screw it and neglect holding the heater. If it turns or moves, you may break a pipe or slightly unthread/move your gas pipe and cause a leak. \n\nAlso, water heaters last longer than ten years without maintenance. Buy a quality one and itll last almost surely last 15-17 years if you dont have super hard water. 18-20 in the right conditions. The ones that dont last are usually in cases where people have well water. Not all well water is hard, but when it is hard.. oh baby its hard. Had a few in one area last 4-5 years where everyone was on well water.\n\nWhat you definitely want to do is flush your heater every few months. Just attatch a hose to the drain valve on the bottom and open it for 5-10 min or until the water runs clear. Also, check how hot the heater is set. On the box near the bottom (for gas heaters) theres a red or black dial that goes from something like hot,a,b,c,hottest. You want it as low as possible, usually A seems to a good setting. Though youll want the water above 120 to kill bacteria, microorganisms, etc. Having the burner firing like the depths of hell is not good for the metal tank\n\nIt is a good idea to replace the anode rode every few years, but dont think its as easy as OP says. In the case youre unable to change it, dont call a plumber unless you know your water is 15% gravel. You can expect to pay at least 200, maybe 250 or more depending on your area. Lets say you do this every 4 years, you\u2019ve now spent 800-1000$ by the time your heater is 17 years old. Enough to buy a top shelf heater with a couple hundred left over",

Trying too hard to break free a seized anode rod can break the pipe threads on the tank where the anode rod connects (and thus your tank is immediately ruined) or you can accidentally rotate the tank and bend the copper tubing connected to the tann. This is theoretically a good thing to do on a tank, but it can be hard to execute for someone not reasonably confident in their skills",

It's probably corroded in place even in dryer climates, and it may take something like a 4' breaker bar to get the thing loose.  I bought a replacement rod for mine a few months ago, but neither an electric impact nor a 18\" breaker bar have budged it.",

            "comment": "Also, if your hot water has a particularly bad eggy smell, consider swapping your anode rod out for an aluminum/zinc rod. The standard rod in these is a magnesium rod which reacts with certain microbes common in well water that produces magnesium sulfate, which has a strong eggy smell.\n\nIts not hard at all to replace these rods, you need a good socket wrench, and a piece of pipe for leverage on it in most cases. You'll also most likely need a second person to help keep the tank steady while you're removing the old rod and adding the new one. The rods can usually be bought in kits that come with the socket you need, the rod, and the Teflon tape.\n\nAlso, make sure you turn off the water and power to the tank first and drain it partially so it doesn't leak all over the place when you take out the rod. There's usually a tap on the bottom of the tank you can open that you can either connect a hose to, or if your tank is sitting high enough, you can just put a bucket under. Drain it more than you think you need to be cause you'll probably get backflow from the pipes in the house going back in to the tank as you drain it. Dont drain it all the way though, the extra weight will make it easier to stabilize the tank when you're unscrewing the rod.\n\nAlso, don't forget to fill the tank back up before you turn the power back on, powering the heating element with no water can burn it out.\n\nSome tanks will bury the anode rod's access point under some foam, you just need to dig it out. It'll usually be hidden under a punchout in the top of the tank. Mine had a plastic cap over the hole, and then about 3 inches of foam covering it that I had to cut out.\n\nAlso, make sure you measure your clearance above the tank. Most of the anode rods are a solid piece and you might not have the ceiling space over your tank to feed in the rod.  They make flexible rods which come in segments like sausage links though which will solve that problem.",

It's just a plastic tube that channels incoming cold water down from the top of the heater to the bottom (i.e. away from the hot water output) so that it mixes with the hot water instead of being forced right out the hot water side.\n\nThose dip tubes can disintegrate, which can lead to very uneven hot water. As long as you're replacing the sacrificial anode, might as well replace the dip tube.",

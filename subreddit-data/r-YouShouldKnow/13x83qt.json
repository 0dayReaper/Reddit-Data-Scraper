    "postText": "**What YSK:** Some people have quick self-deprecating wits not because they hate themselves or feel like they're worthless, but because they spent a lot of time in circles that would bust each others' chops. A lot of times when you have a group of friends / coworkers / classmates / etc that love to bust on each other, the best defense is a quick offense against yourself. They can't clown on you if you clown on yourself first.\n\nIt's also sometimes just indicative of someone who enjoys a good joke or witty comeback but also doesn't want to offend or insult anyone, so they target themselves because it's all in good fun and they have a sense of humor about themselves.\n\n**Why YSK:** Because it's _awkward_, dude. It's super awkward to make a funny zinger about myself and then have a nearby friend look me gently in the eyes and tell me that I'm good enough, or worthy of love, or whatever. To be clear, it's appreciated. But it's still awkward as hell. \n\n**What YSD:**  Nothing. Pay attention to the quipper. There's a big difference in tone and body language between someone who's having fun at their own expense and someone who's genuinely down on themselves. And if it actually is the latter, wait until a better opportunity if you really wanna say something. Odds are wherever you are at the moment isn't it.",

So i laughed out off and said \"i get no respect, no respect at all\" in my best dangerfield accent and someone came up to me and said \"why do you feel you aren't respected in the workplace they should be treating you better\"...we had to inform her who rodney dangerfield was.",

            "comment": "I enjoy self deprecating humor\n\nI once reserved a table for 10-12 for an \"annual pizza party\". I mailed out invites, put party favors on the table, the whole shabang. I only invited 3 people. I set up the table to appear as if I was expecting at least 10 or so people. All 3 arrived. As they arrived I checked their names off a list of attendees and I kept stalling saying that \"somebody else\" might be coming. after 45 minutes of sitting around a large, empty table and having everyone \"wait\" for somebody else to show up \"who might be coming\"/\"says they might be a little late\", i relented and said that i guess everyone can go ahead and eat some pizza and made myself appear sad that nobody else showed up to my party.\n\nI brought out some board games that i hid under the table and had everyone play scrabble, which I won.\n\nAlso, I let everyone know when I sent them invites to my pizza party that they'd all be paying for their own food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas this an elaborate self-deprecating prank to make me look as pathetic as possible? Yea.  Is my sense of self-esteem poor? Nah. But I had a great time doing it and it seemed rather funny in my mind so I executed it. I wasn't sure that I could actually arrange a great party, but I was certain I could arrange an awful party, which seemed like a lot more fun anyhow.",

For example, the first bracket currently is from $0 - $9,875 and is at 10%. They increase from there. So all income is taxed using brackets. And EVERY person is taxed the same 10% on their first up to $9,875 of income. This also applies to your ~~adjusted income~~ taxable income, so after deductions. There are many who, after deductions, fall below or at $0 which would make them tax free. It's not a flat rate of income though because there are so many deductions that many different taxable incomes can qualify. \n\nEdit: it's been pointed out that the other or technical term for this is marginal tax rate. I believe the terms are interchangeable but there are much more qualified individuals that have clarified in the comments section so I'll let them take the credit!\n\nFor example: if you make $410,000 a year and you hear that taxes will be more for those making $400,000 it really means that taxes will be more on *income* over $400,000. The only portion you pay that higher tax rate on would be the last $10,000 - not all $410,000. This is how it works for all brackets.\n\nWhy YSK: it's important to understand how Bracketed Taxes work as some people will use a higher tax rate to spread fear. This may freaks someone out that makes just a bit more than the bracket that is being increased. While some think they will now pay a higher rate on all their income, they will actually only pay a higher rate on the income in that tax bracket.",

A progressive income tax system simply means your tax rate increases with your income. You could have income brackets correlated with different tax rates, but simply tax your entire income at the highest marginal rate- most countries don't do this. Most countries have opted for a marginal tax rate, which taxes different portions of your income at differing rates. \n\nThe last part, the marginal tax rate, is what a lot of Americans seem to misunderstand. A lot of Americans don't seem to understand that their income isn't taxed with one rate as a lump sum. They don't understand that various parts of their income are taxed at differing rates. This misunderstanding is, in large part, due to propoganda put out by the wealthy in America, it's then parroted and spread by politicians at rallies and what not. That's why you hear those weird stories about people saying that if they get a raise/work more hours they'll move up a bracket, thus reducing their net income.",

One politician could say despicable things and the party would just eat it all up and try to spin it to make it look good. If you trick them and told them that a politician from the other party said it, they'd say that the politician is a terrible person and what not.\n\nI know this because I once photoshopped a tweet by Trump telling people that wearing a mask is a patriotic thing to do. I made it look like Biden said it instead. When I sent it to the anti-masker/Trump supporter, he viciously attacked the quote, and said all sorts of bad things about it and how it shows that Biden was unfit to be president. And then I linked him to the actual tweet that showed that it was actually Trump who said it.\n\nHis tone changed. He said that it's fine for Trump to say it because he thinks Trump only said it to win the popular vote and doesn't actually think that people should wear masks.\n\nSee? Tribalism. They don't care about the content. They just care if their \"team\" wins. It's no different than a person rooting for their hometown team and calling the rival town's team all these nasty, untrue things. It's no different when a religious person condemns people of other faiths. It's fanaticism. And they'll use mental gymnastics with faulty logic to justify why they believe the things they believe.",

                    "comment": "So, there\u2019s an interesting phenomenon that conservatives have been boogiemaning for a long time about social welfare programs of \u201cdisincentivizing work\u201d that\u2019s makes your uncle not as wrong as you think he is. There\u2019s two different things at play here.\n\n1. US social benefits are intrinsically tired to income/family size.\n\n2. In the US, payroll departments use \u201crugged\u201d formulas to calculate taxes, and then at the end of the tax year the individual accounts for the difference.\n\nIn broad terms, option 1 is when you get more in benefits than you would taking a raise that would move you off social assistance. For instance, say I make enough at $20/hr to receive social assistance equaling $500/month. Any raise needs to be $6k+ (12 months * $500/Mo) to make up the difference if it would move me outside of the ability to gain any assistance. That\u2019s not including taxes that will now be in play because your marginal tax rate @ 47k is higher than 41k. Very rarely, in my life, have I gotten a $6/hr raise, which is the rough equivalent. I\u2019ve actually only seen those jumps when I switch careers or companies, something that\u2019s difficult to do when taking care of dependents. There are multiple struggles usually going on with people receiving assistance - the US social services are austere almost to cruelty. \n\n2. In the case of petty raises, the shift in marginal banding can contract your month:month income due to the calculations in payroll being on your estimate tax bill @ salary. This doesn\u2019t come into play often EXCEPT when you are on the cusp of getting into a higher bracket, and do, but not by much. The tax removed from a marginal pay raise can offset the raise until your next payroll cycle. Note that I said cycle, not year. It smooths itself out once you\u2019re working the expected 40 @ that rate. For example, on a biweekly pay cycle let\u2019s assume I bring in $2000/cycle with an aggregate tax rate of 20%, which means I get $1600/cycle. I work 3/4 of a cycle then get a raise which pushes me to $2200/cycle but an aggregate tax rate of 22%. I\u2019ll get $1,599 and it looks like my raise has gone to taxes. Next pay cycle I\u2019ll get $1,716 though, and everything will come out in the wash when taxes get filed. \n\nProof: (.78 x ((2000 x 3/4)+(2200/4)) == .78 x 2050 &lt; .8 x 2000 == 1599&lt;1600\n\nThose are made up numbers, obviously, and some payroll systems will deduct properly, but not all do, and it\u2019s an easy mistake to make if your payroll is manually processed. Also, that\u2019s a decent raise of $2.50 for most hourly workers, which is my point about your uncle not being as crazy. Truly petty raises have next to nil impact on your take home, because your income isn\u2019t offsetting your marginal rate until you break through to the next rate. Also also, this is INCREDIBLY simplified.\n\n\nEdit:\nAlright, because of those of you below, except for the one prick who really pissed me off (you can go to hell), please stop thinking of it as welfare. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have been lazy on reddit and have edited that now. Social assistance is a broad category of support services. What people consider welfare is usually a program called TANF, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which is a cash assistance program. There is also SNAP (food stamps), WIC (women infants and children) and others. Every state runs them slightly differently, but many are federally funded.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not use reddit as a source of what you are/are not eligible for. Please go talk to a state caseworker. If you are struggling, it\u2019s ok to struggle. But I can\u2019t help you, and neither can anyone on reddit, in an attempt to understand your state requirements. Also, just because you\u2019re getting social assistance now doesn\u2019t mean you have to keep using them forever. They\u2019re there to help you keep a roof over your head, feed your family or get through hard times. It\u2019s bureaucratic  and confusing and that\u2019s why the state hires people to help you. Even if it feels like they aren\u2019t taking you seriously, or don\u2019t care, they do. Those jobs are brutally difficult and emotionally exhausting. Remember that they\u2019re trying to help you.\n\n2nd edit: forgot that asterisks made things italicized and was fucking up my formulas. Replaced with x\u2019s",

Welfare is a terrible word to try to describe the available social assistance programs in the US. In this case I was trying to say the net benefits I may receive might equal $500 total between TANF and SNAP. I was also just using round numbers for ease of access, although it\u2019s pretty easy to find cases of exactly that. People on federal minimum wage are almost always eligible for some supplemental assistance, it\u2019s well below the $150% poverty line for a household of 1. \n\nIf you need assistance or know someone who does, please have them reach out to their state caseworkers to go over their unique situation. Usually these programs are Health and Human Services run (DHHS in state initialisms often). Or have them search for TANF/SNAP benefits in their state.",

If your bank / stocks / whatever interest rate doesn't keep pace with inflation, then you lose. It's not like putting $1 into a ban in 1970 may have given you $6.71 by 2020.

The raise might push them past the income limits for coverage or subsidies but still be worth less than the cost of coverage or the subsidies. So, in net, they're worse off after a raise. Given insurance can be worth $500-$600 per month for one adult for mediocre coverage, the instances where people will turn down raises or extra hours in order to keep coverage is actually common.",

We did the math.  The math for my mom said to go with the $1700 per month. But if, for example, the new amount was theoretically $1500, she\u2019d been better staying with the $1050 per month.

You set the payouts so someone who never works gets more from the government than someone who works a little, but that the person who works a little has a higher income overall. \n\nYou use it in place of traditional welfare programs entirely. It's more efficient because there aren't any binary thresholds or means testing. If you don't make much, you get paid to help you out. But it's always in your best interest to work more. Your effective marginal tax rate never goes through the roof like it does with our current programs.",

In any case I think it's mostly a huge argument for universal base income and health coverage.\n\nProviding special welfare only to unemployed and low income people means that going from unemployed to a basic job often provides little to no benefit. If they for example lose $0.5 for each $1 they earn, it is effectively a 50% tax rate (even if not through the actual tax system). And in the reality of most welfare schemes, that would still be a mild case.\n\nSo a UBI can both ensure that everyone gets proper coverage of their essentials and that work pays off from the first $. And that's just one of many reasons why the whole \"if we covered everyone's needs, people wouldn't want to work anymore\" argument is completely wrong.",

If you get $400 a month in food and childcare benefits and get a $200 a month raise at your job, which causes you to no longer be qualify for that assistance, you suddenly have a $200 a month deficit because you got a raise.\n\nNot exactly the same thing, but I have seen people have to turn down better paying positions because it would cause them to no longer qualify for assistance and they would be worse off.

Basically, nobody knows how much money you'll make in a given year, so the best we can do is make an educated guess on how much to withhold. For normal wages, this works fine since your wages are pretty steady from check to check.\n\nFor small windfalls or pay periods where a lot of overtime is worked, those educated guesses break down a little. My layman's understanding is that the payroll department/company will assume you will make that same amount every check (biweekly, monthly, whatever your pay schedule is). So when you get a much larger check than normal, the system assumes you'll be making much more that year than you actually will, and so taxes are withheld at a higher rate to cover your apparently higher tax liability.\n\nThis is all corrected when you file your taxes and calculate your actual tax payments and liability, which is why you'll receive a lot of that over-withholding back in a refund.\n\nedit: a word",

This guy knows better. If there's anyone who is ultra-shrewd when it comes to US tax law, it's a Republican lawmaker. He *knows* how marginal taxes work. He *knows* that the 70% income tax rate would only apply to money earned over $10,000,000. He *knows* that his constituents won't earn $10,000,001 in their entire lifetimes, let alone in one year. And yet, here he is spreading deliberate propaganda. \n\nSo not only are we not educating people about how marginal taxes work in the US, our very leaders (Republican leaders) are deliberately lying to us about it.\n\nIt's fucking disgusting and it should be a felony for a government official to lie to American citizens like this.",

That's why bonuses and overtime are withheld so heavily.\n\nEDIT: Changed a word, as u/Sigurlion pointed out it is misleading.  It is not taxed at that rate, but the money is withheld. When you do your taxes at the end of the year you then determine your taxable income/rates.",

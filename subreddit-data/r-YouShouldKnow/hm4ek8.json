Prairie dog hole in the park with flea powder (well, Deltamethrin/Delta Dust) to combat potential plague, not because of risk to people, but because plague can wipe out an entire colony very easily. And prairie dog specific predators, namely the black footed ferret (once extinct in the wild) have been severely harmed by plague. \n\nPeople still regularly attempt to feed them.\n\nMore than plague, I think hantavirus is a bigger concern with rodents, honestly. Hantavirus doesn't have any cure like plague does. It's all supportive airway treatment.\n\nHonestly, if Sin Nombre hantavirus figured out person-to-person transmission we'd be far more fucked than we are by covid. [It killed half the people who got it in the small number of people who got it in a 1993 outbreak. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Four_Corners_hantavirus_outbreak?wprov=sfla1)\n\nTeal deer (mouse): Y pestis in the form of Sylvatic Plague always exists in wildlife, mostly rodents, that's absolutely nothing new, and you shouldn't handle wild rodents or mustelids. But plague is more dangerous to them than to us. And plague is easily treated, while another pathogen from rodents, hantavirus, is far spookier.",

Only your immune system can fight it. There is a experimental drug, bit that is now practically unavailable, due to some circumstances.",

Infection rate is something to worry about, in the UK, they infection rate soared very quickly because we were late in lockdown of the country. But unfortunately the US is a lot worse, mainly due to no lockdown, people not wearing masks and social distancing. These are all proven to work.

The places where people are refusing to wear masks are being hit pretty hard now. I'm definitely doing what I can to prevent getting it, but at the same time I've lost fear of it. I'm not sure if it's because I'm healthy or if lockdown went for too long, but it doesn't seem healthy to live in fear.",

But people taking them when they don't need them also doesn't help and are more likely to stop using them early because they 'feel fine' .\n\nPlus probably the biggest factor is the fact that the meat industry packs a tonne of animals in cramped and dirty conditions. Then stuffs them full of antibiotics so that they don't get sick enough to die before they're sent to the slaughterhouse and packed up for distribution and consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of the operation and truly awful conditions of the animals (usually wading in their own shit!) is literally a melting pot of diseases, just waiting to get the chance to create the next pandemic... It's simply a matter of time and statistics before something even worse comes along. \n\nWe need change and we need it now.",

Most of the time it isn't human cases out here, but mosquitoes testing positive or rabid animals being found. There have been a couple cases over the years, but it isn't rampant by any means.\n\nCalifornia in general has over 400 cases of rabies annually, but in animals, not humans. The risk is still there, but you're highly unlikely to ever encounter a rabid animal.\n\nThere's only been [one case] (http://westnile.ca.gov/mobile.php) in California of West Nile Virus in a human this year. It is also exceedingly rare in humans.\n\nHantavirus is a valid concern, because Yosemite gets an infected population of mice every so often, and the last outbreak was in 2012 IIRC.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquitoes aren't going to carry anything they don't already have, and since Yellow Fever, Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya aren't really known to be here, it would be impossible for them to transmit any of these diseases if it wasn't already in the local population.\n\nJust be smart about staying out at night. I don't really see bats much, raccoon activity is higher in urban areas though, and coyotes are in the countryside. Vaccinate your pets. Wear mosquito repellant when outdoors in endemic areas during mosquito season. Don't interact with local wildlife, especially birds and rodents. You should be fine.",

But the pneumonic form allows for airborne transmission and, as stated by another commenter, is almost always lethal in modern contexts. I mainly said that because there is a movement that denies that the Black Death was caused by Yestinia Pestis because proponents doubt that it could spread as quickly as described. Coupled with different standards and conventions of medical writing, it seems plausible that maybe we don't fully understand the medieval perspective. The past is like  a foreign country, and thus difficult to completely understand",

My friend was working for his dad at his pet hospital where they deal with stray cats all the time.  My friend was going on vacation to SoCal to visit a friend for the week. He had noticed a lump in his groin area but decided not to do anything about it until after his vacation. By the time he got there, the swelling increased and was extremely painful. Luckily his friend's mom was an ER doctor and rushed him to the hospital, in Lancaster of all places, and was told he had the plague. \n\nIt's normally not that big of a deal as it's treatable with penicillin. Crazy to think that all the Europeans needed back then was some penicillin. \n\nAnyways, he was hospitalized for his entire vacation. The swelling in his groin area grew to larger than softball size, his balls swelled to an abnormal size as well. They created channels throughout the area to clean out the infection and to flush it each day. He waited so long to get it checked out that he ended up needing to get a picc line to his heart for antibiotics. When he got back home it was weeks of wound care treatment and he still had the picc line for his meds. \n\nIf you ever find a lump in your armpit or your groin, get it checked out immediately. It's not worth all the extra stuff you need to go through.\n\nLikewise, wear a mask during our current times. Momentary discomfort is better than the horror stories I've been reading about. You certainly don't want to be the cause of someone else going through that.",

The media ALWAYS has breaking news, and it's not uncommon for it to be about some new and terribly deadly disease, only to have it disappear as quickly as it showed up. I blame news outlets in large part for people not taking coronavirus seriously when it first started spreading because they worry more about ratings/clicks than they do about responsible reporting.",

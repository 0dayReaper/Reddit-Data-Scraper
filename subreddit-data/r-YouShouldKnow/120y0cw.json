This is not a functional debate or conversation, and should not be taken as anyone \"winning\" a debate. It's invalidation and other toxic forms of conversation, which do not bring healthy outcomes.\n\nHealthy debate involves different sides hearing and understanding one another, then focusing on the topic without devolving into personal attacks.",

Like the argument against vegetarianism and veganism, that plowing a field kills animals. That's out of the vegan's control. What's in their control is their choice of food, and maybe they grow their own food.\n\nThe arguments against feminism are similar, but sometimes valid. Female soccer players, for example, make a substantially higher percentage of revenue than males. But it ends up being less because men's soccer brings in so much more money. However, that point can't be used to derail more valid points.",

Lesser names in any sport can actually not earn very much.\n\nBut when you start digging into the economic disparity between owners and players, the reason for player strikes becomes more clear. If the executives of female soccer can part with over 22% of their revenue, the execs of male soccer must be able to get closer to that percentage. They just don't want or have to.\n\nIf you just look at FIFA president Gianni Infantino's 2022 income compared to Lionel Messi's, he made $300M versus Messi's $130. That's more than 230% higher.\n\nSame thing with the minimum wage argument. Owners, execs and investors are given the greater shares while the working poor are in poverty. It's an issue far greater than gender inequality.",

I have several acquaintances who rationalize putting themselves through hours of frustration and pain having arguments online for this very reason. When I ask them how they know if they're making a difference they do not have an answer. I am willing to do real-world activism; I work for a nonprofit and volunteer at 2 more. Arguing online seems like a way people can feel like an activist without actually doing much of anything.\n\nIf there isn't a metric for success on this (and there doesn't seem to be) I would rather not ruin my day. If arguing online *is* demonstrably effective, then I may not restrict myself so much. I agree that arguing is a useful skill--I just think that it is often squandered.\n\nThen again, the problem online is that the audience is usually impressionable, but not neutrally so.\n\nThis isn't an opinion that is contrary to your own.

No idea. \n\nI will say that in every day conversation with impressionable friends, I am more prepared and educated to handle their questions and concerns on topics. Like a friend questioned affirmative action, and I had experience of my brother not getting a job because of affirmative action, but I also had statistics of how likely my brother would get the next job, which he did.

You can prove that somebody beats, neglects, or otherwise abuses children or can't support them. It's a bit different to prove that this WILL or will likely happen at some undetermined time in the future.\n\nHow does the state determine parental competence? And can it do so fairly? There are many in the US who would rip kids away from Homosexual couples or Muslims or Mexicans (the latter of whomever they literally did). There are people who would take kids away from Socialists or single fathers.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong, of course, just that it's highly exploitable. \n\nPeople tend to have double think for this sort of stuff. They think it's fine if they are their folk do it, but not if thems undesirables do it. Rules for thee, not for me stuff. It's wrong of the Catholic church to do it too, but they basically control 20% of the world's population so they can get away with it.\n\nAs for China's One Child law, lots of people batted a lot of eyes. That was a terrible program meant to try and solve a terrible issue. Nobody I've ever known commends that program. There were a lot of problems with it, least of all the inevitable age up of the population. Most of the problems came from social conflicts like sexism. They have a badly skewed male:female ratio because of it. \n\nI think the main takeaway is the motive. Eugenics is violence, and it's designed to be abused. The motive is to punish, eliminate, or exclude particular people and their characteristics. It is inherently prejudicial, so of course it'll attract prejudicial people.\n\nApplying methods that prevent actual disease and disability, and preventing objectively unfit parents from having children they won't or can't take care of is one thing. But there's probably no way to keep it that one thing. What makes for an unfit parent is prone to bias, and prevention of suffering seems to be considered quite un-American. \n\nAbortion I think is also an important mention. Should people be allowed to determine whether they will have children or not? Should they have dominion over their own bodies? Can the government decide for them? Can other people decide for them?\n\nSome people conflate abortion with Eugenics, but they're not the same thing. Pro-choice is dominion within oneself. Eugenics is a bastardization of survival of the fittest that *can* include Abortion, but that isn't pro-choice. Eugenicists don't want to give you a choice.\n\nThat's the problem. If you allow the government to decide who does and does not get to have children, shitheads will abuse it.",

He claim is that women are being targeted for violence bc they have boobs, which is exactly what you said as well- women are likely to be the victims of sexual assault. Targeting women *because* they have specific body parts. That's the point that was made.",

Conflating feminism and misandry is redirecting the negative energy received unjustly onto other people who don\u2019t deserve it. \n\nI know it sucks for people to be mean, but part of being a strong person is being able to deal with unjust behavior and let it go if you aren\u2019t able to direct a response at the attacker, and to actively search for reasons *not* to dish back.

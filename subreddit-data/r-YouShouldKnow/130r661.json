A year of two later, it's \"settled\".  As one of a couple hundred thousand plaintiffs you get a check for 17 cents, meanwhile the law firm that brought the suit takes a third of the settlement and gets millions.\n\nEdit: typo",

Basically, they force publishers to sign contracts that prevent competition, creating the monopoly known as Steam.\n\nThese are actually illegal practices. However, as users, you and I cannot start a lawsuit, because when we create an account we sign a TOS that says we agree not to. But if an outside party, the law firm, starts a class action lawsuit on behalf of users then users can join that lawsuit and be entitled to compensation.\n\nThis is how I have understood it. I could be wrong, so anyone correct me if you understand it better. But yes, as the other person said, it's far too expensive for an individual to sue over a messily couple hundred dollars or less.",

    "postText": "Trust me. They may seem very intelligent, mature and understanding and they may be so too but you can do your children a very great favor by not blurring this line, or else, without you even realizing it can become an immense and distressing burden for your children.\n\nEdit: Wow I did not expect this post to blow up like this but I am very glad it did. Thank you so everyone who is sharing their personal stories, the fact that you went through all this and it\u2019s negative impacts on you is a testament to why this advice matters.\n\nAlso thank you so much for all the awards.\n\nSome people seem to be missing my point or perhaps he I could\u2019ve been clearer. So there are a couple of clarifications:\n \n\u2022 this post in no way suggests that you should lie to your children and pretend like everything is okay when it is not\n\u2022 there is a middle ground between lying to your children, pretending there is no problem, and evading any questions they may have and sharing way too much and even unintentionally putting all the baggage on them and feeling like it\u2019s their responsibility to fix it.\n\u2022 this post does suggest that you should not, no matter the maturity intelligence level of your children, you should NOT put the burden of your marital/divorce-related problems to the children, do not mistake them for your marriage counselor, or your best friend, or your confidante.\n\u2022 you may be alone, go make friends or talk to a therapist, please\n\u2022 not dumping every single emotional baggage on your children IS different than having a conversation with them  and talking with them about the issues that may affect them on a need-to-know bases \n\u2022 also, abuse is a human rights violation is different than cheating and smaller fights, and requires a separate consideration along with any other safety threats. \n\n\nFor those of you who are asking what this post is based on, or what is the psychological backing...  Please look into terms \u201cparentified child\u201d, \u201cearly parentification\u201d, \u201cemotional (covert) incest\u201d and \u201ctriangulation\u201d. \n\nPlease read u/sassatha \u2018s comment on this thread where they briefly explain emotional incest.\n\nSending everyone love and kindness. You can unlearn and learn the healthy ways, and to establish new healthy boundaries.",

At fourteen I drew the line when the pressure of keeping my family together pushed me to a really dark mental place. My mum completely withdrew and started forcing me to confide in her. My dad started blaming me whenever anything went wrong.\n\nNow I take responsibility for everything (even being born and limiting my parents\u2019 prospects), find it difficult to set boundaries without feeling guilty, I struggle with confiding in people, have too many repressed memories to count and I\u2019ve distanced myself from basically everyone because I feel guilty for not being able to solve everyone\u2019s problems.\n\nI knew at age 8 that my parents were going to divorce at some point and that it would be my dad leaving my mum in the dust because she\u2019s too scared to.\n\nObviously there are other issues in my parent\u2019s relationship. Leaning on me when I was just a child damaged me beyond anything else.\n\nDon\u2019t do the same to your children.",

The details aren't damaging. And they aren't going to resort to petty name-calling, attacks and hurtful criticism. That's what unhealthy people do, and those are the \"details\" that are harmful for children to hear.\n\nSo you're really only speaking to unhealthy people, it's the proverbial band-aid on a bullet wound.

There are definitely areas that need improvement, but it's working for both of them and they're a pretty cute couple. But if they hadn't made an effort to be transparent with us growing up, we would never have guessed.\n\nNeither of them is really emotionally intelligent at all and they both have some stuff they have not worked through at all. So they tend to bottle up negative emotion and then blow up. They're not violent, just kinda have a meltdown: yelling, crying, complaining etc. Then the other one tries to help, and sometimes it works, and often it doesn't change anything.\n\nBut sometimes the other parent gets sucked in and now both of them are having a mutually reinforcing meltdown/fight. Again, no physical violence, no name calling, but every single dumb petty grievance and feeling and miscommunication gets shouted at full volume. Usually with some stomping and loud housework. We lived in a bungalow and we weren't deaf, so yeah, we knew what was going on. If that was all we'd seen, we would have been seriously messed up.\n\nBut thankfully, every time that would happen, as soon as my dad would cool off a bit (usually way before my mother), he would take us for a long walk and explain that this was not ideal, but it was just a bump in a road they had both chosen. And that, even when they were flaming mad, they still loved each other and were all in. And then we would get back, and all calmly sit on my parents' bed and talk about what adjustments needed to be made to resolve the issues that had been brought up. And then we would all hug and cry it out.\n\nAnd every day, they would flirt at the kitchen table, and compliment each other on everything, and do sweet things for each other, and talk about their days. There were lots of PDAs, but also harmless pranks and jokes. They had a rule that if either of them felt attracted to someone else, they told the other person. That way jealousy and secrets wouldn't fester. When we were older teenagers, they started doing it in front of us, just so we had a more realistic picture of what was going on.\n\nSo yeah, their unhealthy bits were impossible to hide, so thank goodness they made sure to show us their healthy stuff. I'm definitely working on my emotional intelligence and communication because blowouts suck and I don't want them in my relationships. But on the whole, there's a lot from their marriage that I want to emulate.",

Search up enmeshed boundaries on Google and you'll see why over sharing can be detrimental to childhood development. It leads to codependency, anxious or avoidant attachment styles, and a skewed vision of what love/intimacy means.\n\nKids are curious and deserve to know age appropriate answers. I agree that blanket statements are in practice inaccurate or even harmful. A good thing to ask yourself when talking to your children is \"why am I telling them this? Is it because I feel like I have no one to turn to? Am I using my children to get my emotional/intimate needs met? How will this information change how they view my spouse?\" etc etc. \n\nChildren who become \"therapists\" for their parents often learn that performing emotional labour is the only way to receive love. This leads them to choose partners who mistreat them or need \"fixing\".",

Paired with the fact my dad passed away not even a year before she started dating again. I was dragged along for \"meeting \\_\\_\\_\\_'s kids\" all the time. It took a toll and as i got older, anything i was to share about my life turned into her venting to me about every small detail in her dating life.\n\n It ruins the relationship with your child. They become more mature and closed off from the parent because all that can be spoken is the dating/parental/marital problems. \n\nKids are not therapists!",

The term incest has all kinds of connotations, and I think that word being part of it is very off putting. The way I thought about it was this. If overt incest is asking a child to meet sexual needs a parent would usually get from a spouse then emotional incest is asking a child to meet the emotional needs an adult would usually get from a spouse. They both do untold damage. I bought the book because I realised I was in a situation where I didn't want to \"be mean\" to a nice person I am close with by putting my needs first. Traced this back to sitting in the car with my dad whilst he went on and on about his problems and I'd sit there feeling trapped, uncomfortable and guilty that I wanted to tell him \"I don't care, I want to go\" ultimately, my dad was confiding his inner emotional world with me and it felt icky. It felt icky because an emotional boundary was crossed. It's the kind of opening up people do in romantic relationships. He didn't do this on purpose, he likely didn't realise what he was doing. He was just broken after an abusive relationship. But it had a big impact on me. Reading the book also helped me to connect the dots on some stuff with my mum and stepdad too, such as refereeing an argument. I didn't even relate to all the stories, just enough to help me understand how my past dictated my actions in the present. This is basically a lot of words for saying \"don't let the word incest put you off\" you were probably drawn to the book for a reason. I'd really recommend it for anyone who played therapist. Also, fucking sorry you had that crap as well, you were let down.",

One fateful night after my mum was complaining about something my dad had done (again) and her wistfully staring into the distance as she did so, I took a breath and asked \u201chow... _are..._ things between you and dad?\u201d and the floodgates opened. I was a teenager and didn\u2019t have any good advice, so all I said was something like \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be with someone who makes you unhappy\u201d, which is objectively true. But apparently that little shred of validation was all my mum needed to leave my dad. They\u2019re now not together, and my mum takes great pride in painting me as her saviour, with the story having been embroidered regularly over the years so that her version now reads as \u201cI had NEVER considered it until ONE DAY my INSIGHTFUL daughter stood up and said \u2018Mother how DARE you still be with that GHASTLY man when you deserve SO MUCH MORE\u2019 and I gasped as I realised how right she was!!!\u201d when that\u2019s absolutely not what happened. I know they\u2019re probably happier now but selfishly, as the first Christmas with them apart is approaching (they\u2019ve remained friends until now) the child in me still selfishly wish mummy and daddy were still together. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I wish I hadn\u2019t spoken to her about it \u2014 or rather, that she hadn\u2019t involved me even if I had. I\u2019m now a lot closer to my dad when I absolutely wasn\u2019t before, simply because he\u2019s never badmouthed mum the way my mum does to her. For what it\u2019s worth, I think she was worse to him than he was to her anyway.",

She legit asked me if she should divorce my dad when I was somewhere between 7-10, it was pretty constant bad mouthing about him, although he wasn't a great dad or husband anyway and her complaints were legit. I feel like she should have spoken more neutral about him to me, called out specifically the behaviors that were wrong as a lesson on how not to behave, not just go off ranting about him, or actually take action herself to show his behavior was unacceptable and should be stood up to, not just talked ugly about behind his back. That it's okay to leave and stand up for yourself and your kids.\n\n Then as an adult settling into our new house and literally just having a baby, my parents divorce and my mom starts over sharing WAY too much about her new boyfriends and relationships, and dad who has no friends decides I'm the one who should hear all his horrible misogynistic and possessive opinions on my mom's new independent life. \n\nFelt like I was tossed into the middle of some crazy drama that honestly would have had no effect on my own life if they had just acted like normal adults with boundaries. \n\nI'm finally hitting the \"fuck this\" stage and distancing myself from them a bit. I'm tired of feeling like I have to listen to their drama and be their therapist because they don't have anyone else to vent to.

            "comment": "There is a term for this sort of dynamic called emotional incest or covert incest. It's very, very damaging and leaves people with people pleasing tendencies, sexual problems, problems identifying their needs and a whole host of other problems. Children are not supposed to be emotional fulfilment for their parents, and they are not supposed to carry the emotional load that their parents need relief from. Children are very fragile during development and mistakes will cost them self esteem and relationships for a lifetime until they gain insight into what happened to them and the results. Some don't get that chance of healing and true happiness. For anyone affected by this I highly recommend the book Silently Seduced as a resource to help you understand what happened to you, and more importantly the issues it has left you with. It can be overcome, as with any faulty programming we receive in childhood",

Around the time I turned 16 she started developing into more of a friend first parent second type mom and while it was no secret that my parents weren't going to last much longer the way it was brought up to me was pretty fucked up. When I was 18 My mom was planning a trip alone down to Illinois to \"visit her parents\" a day or two before she left she felt it neccessary to inform me that the true purpose was to go and cheat on my dad with some dude from her highscool back in the day. I didn't take that well and screamed that she needs to talk to my dad and not tell me this. So she told my dad what she was doing and went anyway. Probably the second hardest thing I've had to watch my dad go through. After she came back like a week later she kicked him out, and continued trying to tell me about how shitty my dad was. And as an added bonus felt like enlightening me in great detail about her craigslist hookups. Needless to say I moved in with my dad as soon as he had a place.",

They\u2019d yell and slam doors. One would occasionally leave the house in the car and not return for a day. \n\nThey\u2019d forget to pick us up from school on time or from friends\u2019 houses. They\u2019d get caught up in their argument and forget to cook us dinner or come watch our sporting events. Or worse, they\u2019d show up and attempt to pretend everything was okay while barely speaking to one another.\n\nMy siblings and I often camped out in each other\u2019s rooms on the bad nights or would communicate using our Nintendo DSs since we didn\u2019t have cell phones then. \n\nThe worst night of all was the first night my mom came down the hallway to our rooms at 3am announcing that she was leaving our dad. She called out that she was packing a bag and staying the night in a hotel tonight and that if any of us kids wanted to go with us, we could pack a bag now. She was asking us to take a side. Paralyzed with fear, none of us moved and pretended to be asleep despite all their shrieking.\n\nWhen they were around us they always vented about the other parent. I remember one oh so popular question they\u2019d ask us...\u201dWhat do I do?\u201d Little preteen me would try my best to come up with solutions. I\u2019d try to use what the one parent had told me their frustrations were to suggest improvement in the other parent. I\u2019m sure I was less than sneaky because then the parent I was talking to would angerly ask if \u201cmom/dad told you that??\u201d Or shoot my ideas down with \u201cthen mom/dad will just say or do blah blah blah so it won\u2019t work. What do I do??\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else I can do.\u201d\n\nSo, so many more stories from that time that still fill me with pain and anxiety. It wasn\u2019t fair to us kids. We were just kids. \n\nMy parents never divorced and after 2 and a half years, things started to get better. It\u2019s been close to 15 years now and I think they\u2019re content. Happy would be a stretch.",

Never raised their voices to each other. But the tension and the silence were thick. Most of the time they looked miserable. \n\nWhen I was around 40 years old I went to visit my parents. They had retired and moved to a beautiful island. I asked that my dad spend the day with me exploring local caves and do some hiking. Best day I ever had with him. We were never close. Never had deep conversations. \n\nDriving back to their house he confided to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I wound up married to your mother. We have nothing in common. She would never take a walk with me or do any of the things I enjoy. She doesn\u2019t like people.\u201d \n\nIt was the first time I felt sorry for him. He\u2019d spent decades not enjoying life. It was sad. Then I thought of how sad for my Mom to be with someone who had these private negative thoughts about your marriage. \n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about that conversation through the years. Next month they will have their 54th wedding anniversary. He won\u2019t remember because dementia is chasing him down. She\u2019ll be sad because he won\u2019t remember and resentful that everything has fallen on her. \n\nNow that my Mom is in her 70\u2019s she has begun using me as a sounding board for her marriage troubles. Some times she goes into TMI territory and I have to tell her to put the brakes on. I\u2019m still her daughter and don\u2019t need to know. I don\u2019t need to know about your sex life. I don\u2019t need to know about the affairs you think my Dad had or the illegitimate kids you\u2019re trying to find. Because he\u2019s losing his memory she\u2019s making it her mission to quiz him often about his past. Trying to catch him in a lie. I. Don\u2019t. Want. To. Know!",

Let your kids see you work through conflicts like responsible adults, but for the love of god never make them a key player in that conflict. They can easily learn to feel responsible for keeping the peace, or that your love for them is dependent on playing that role. That's a horrible place to be as a kid, and leads to all kinds of problems as an adult.",

My parents have been together for 30+ yrs and have had four kids but now their marriage is on the rocks.\n\n On one hand, I have my dad- who's not really the type to share anything- venting to me about what's going on and how he's feeling. And I know I've told him I'm here if he needs someone to lean on, cause he doesn't really have anyone else...but I'm not use to seeing him this...vulnerable and helpless... It's starting to weigh on me cause I can't do anything to help him feel better or fix it.\n\nAnd on the other, I have my mom who's not telling me anything at all. I tell her everything and she knows she can tell me anything...we're really really close but now she's been so secretive and distant... Like she doesn't really care about her relationship with my dad or her kids. And I feel like I'm having to beg her to remember we're important to her. Its messing me up really bad.\n\nI'm 24 and I thought I was grown enough to handle this but it feels like this shit has set me back to 13. I don't know what to do. I feel so helpless and sad that the most important thing to me is falling apart and I have no one to talk to. I don't feel like putting more weight on my dad's shoulders than he has already and my mom's been so distant I don't feel...secure..talking to her anymore.\n\nOther factors come into play too. But this is the gist...Sorry for the long comment that no one asked for lol. This post just really hit home to me.",

Told her it felt like I was part of their fucked up relationship and that I had never felt more stressed.

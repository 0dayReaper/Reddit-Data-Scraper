    "postText": "Why YSK: A lot of guys develope a kink of sorts in their urethra in their 30s that can cause a residual amount of urine to lay dormant until a minute or so after urination, thus causing a miniscule amount of pee to seep out after doing their business and zipping everything shut, despite how much they may shake it. If you want to avoid lightly urine soaked underwear and pants, this is what you need to do",

Apparently, using your lower abdominal muscles to push in any way is not ideal since it doesn't allow the bladder to contribute. The recommendation was to relax rather than push, and to avoid using abdominal muscles to push out the last few drops. This takes longer, but allows the bladder tissue to better develop and learn to contract fully or something.",

I've had all the antibiotics there are.  I've had the Flomax.  I even got the whole \"shove a camera up your dick\" thing.  Without any anesthetic.  That was fun.  Got to queef out my dick after.  That was super awesome too.  Urologist was like \"I dunno try more antibiotics and flomax again\".",

Do guys have pelvic floor muscles? I don't know what muscles you use to pee with (abs?), but we aren't that different so it may be worth seeing if you can find a pelvic physical therapist who has experience treating men. It can seriously work wonders!",

One of them I filed a complaint against, because she would interrupt my testimony to condescend to me and when I pointed it out to her she would act oblivious. \"You know pee isn't *really* stored in the balls,\" level of discourse, I shit you not.\n\nThe urethroplasty required donor tissue from the inside of my mouth, and the procedure slightly shortened the length of my dick, which I wasn't exactly moose-hung to begin with. And now because of this leakage issue, I worry about my underwear and bedding smelling like urine, and frequently catch psychosomatic whiffs of it.\n\nI basically don't pursue any sexual relations anymore due to insecurity and fear of disappointing the other party, which as you can imagine causes its own problems. Which extra sucks because I am totally starting to feel that biological clock tick and I'm kind of ready for kids.\n\nThere's a bit more to it, but that's probably sufficient for the moment.",

There are muscles that contract to help expel contents of the bladder, and they don't always coordinate well with gravity or shifts in muscles in the pelvic floor.\n\nAnd you can always do the gooch push to be sure when peeing sitting, it's just a bit more risky over a toilet bowl.  You'll find, over time, that there are specific places along the gooch to push for full efficacy.  Gentle pressure is all that's needed.",

Some people seem to prefer the streets of the bus stops or a laundromat, etc. Sometimes it's all they know. I work as a Resource Coordinator for an agency that helps find housing for the homeless. I'm not sure the exact numbers but homelessness occurs mainly because of mental illness. We have some people that we've found apartments for, pay a substantial subsidy toward their rent, link them with mental and physical health services, provide access to employment opportunities, you name it. And some of them will have all of this lined up and we'll still find them on the streets. We have one gentleman who comes to the office at least twice a week. I believe every team member there has at least on one occasion explained to him the process he needs to go through in order to get into one of our programs. It's not a difficult process, but for whatever reason he will not do it so we can't actually provide any services for him aside from letting him use the phones and computers in a little resource area we have set up. It's a tough thing to do sometimes because you'll put in a ton of effort to help someone and they either destroy the opportunity in some fashion or they show zero gratitude and expect everything to be handed to them. But that's the name of the game. I myself just try to do everything I'm trained to do but if they decide to stop walking long with me in these endeavors then I have to stop walking as well and direct my efforts to other people on my caseload. These are voluntary services so the individuals can opt out whenever they want. And when they do the typically don't tell us and end up \"in the wind\" for months at a time which forces us to go on a wild goose chase to find them. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. You do your best but you can't save everyone. ",

You can coordinate donation drives by linking with shelters and other places that provide services to the homeless and find out what's needed (could be a food drive, clothing drive, etc). You can also sign up to be a part of Code Blue where you'll receive some training on how to interact with homeless individuals who suffer from mental illness. I'm not sure if Code Blue is a New York state thing only or if other states have it (or a similar program). Doing stuff like that can introduce you to all kinds of people and you may end up getting linked to an agency similar to mine where you could apply for a job.\n\nAside from that, you can look into jobs in the human services field. Human services is broad term that covers a vast array of services. Work in a group home? That's human services. Work at the Department of Social Services? That's human services. Some colleges offer associates degrees or certificates in human services. \n\nI myself kinda worked my way through a handful of human services jobs until I ended up here. Started in a group home, then worked for Hospice delivering/setting up in-home medical equipment for Hospice patients (very unique job that produces some interesting answers when someone asks how your workday went. \"Well, I was about to deliver some oxygen tanks to a gentleman but then he, uh, died, so... he didn't need them anymore.\") After that I did supervision at a pre-vocational center for adults with developmental disabilities, teaching them piecework type jobs while also working to prepare them to find jobs in their communities. And then I was a Counselor Aide for a drug rehab that focused on young adults (ages 18-21). My experience over this ten year period became my education in this field and I guess my director saw something in me during the interview process because she had to go to HR and argue for me to be hired sans bachelors degree which this job requires. \n\nHope this helps! Sorry I ramble on, I have an innate inability to tell a short story. Feel free to PM me with anymore questions and thank you for your comment!",

Do we even have the knowledge to \"fix\" whatever is wrong with him?\n\nYou offer no actual solutions. You talk about paying more in taxes, but to do what? What services would get this man off the street and into a job. You refer to \"until he gets a job\", implying you think that's possible. How? \n\nWhat would the tax money pay for? What services would be offered that aren't already available or that he would accept voluntarily? What treatment would \"cure\" him? \n\nI mean, I totally support public psychiatric services. We have them here in Canada. We have mental health facilities free to patients, including addictions services. Yet we still have homeless people. \n\nI even support Universal Basic Income, at least testing it (which we are doing). But, I also know there are some people who just can't be helped. Short of locking them up in institutions and force-feeding them food they don't want, there isn't a way to get some people off the street. It sounds like your homeless person may fall into that category. If free room, board, and mental health services (paid by taxes) aren't enough to keep some people off the street, I can't imagine a solution that would work. \n\nI'm open to suggestions as well, but even the experts in the field don't seem to have any. We used to lock such people up in institutions against their will. I don't think that's a very good solution either, as it is basically a prison sentence for the crime of being homeless. I really don't have a solution except to let them be homeless and make sure they know they have places to go for help.",

People need to stop projecting their own ideas of a good life onto those who aren't like them. Make the help available and visible, in a take it or leave it scenario, not much else to be done. ",

Can't remember the name, but it had a grade-school kid that had moved to a big city (I think New York) and he befriended a homeless guy. It gets fuzzy from there, but I think the kid enjoyed going to the library. It was in the winter and there's some series of events that happen and eventually the kid leaves his house to go find the homeless guy and I'm fairly certain the kid ends up dying out in the cold, though it may have been the homeless guy that died.\n\nWould love if that sounded at all familiar to someone. It's such a fuzzy memory that it could even have been a movie, but whenever winter rolls around I always find myself thinking back to that.",

All of this so said person doesnt freeze to death and also reduce police calls. When the weather is really cold it opens to sober people as well. Alaska has a huge under publicised problem with people freezing to death; mostly alchohol related. Ive even seen college age people pass out in snowbanks and almost not make it.

What seems to be happening is someone calls 311 to report a homeless person, as soon as the person says they look cold they get transferred over to 911. 911 then sends an ambulance and a police car and makes the call type a COLD or hypothermia. The ambulance and police car get there and the patient usually says, \"no I'm good.\" Only to have them called again.\n\nAt this point, the people who are out on the street want to stay out on the street. I even saw one guy that had a sign up begging people not to call 311, he said, \"...this is my home leave me alone.\"\n\nI actually agree that this is a health emergency. I have no issue transporting them. There have been plenty of ambulances who have picked up genuinely hypothermic people. But I have only picked up one out of the four people that I have been dispatched to. If you don't believe me, find an EMS scanner online that covers Manhattan and listen to how many COLDs get dispatched.\n\nMy other complaint, during this entire storm and cold snap I have not seen one homeless Outreach crew. The ambulances are the homeless Outreach. And unfortunately we only have one option for them: the hospital. Once it is deemed that they don't have a medical problem, they get discharged within a few hours back into the cold.\n\nThe city really needs to figure out a better way of caring for the homeless. And for all of you thinking that this should happen there's all times of the year? That actually does. People call 311 and 911 for homeless people all the time.",

            "comment": "This is true, but its only half of the story you should know about, and the other half is complete bullshit.  Once code blue is in effect any homeless people sleeping on the streets lose their legal right to refuse treatment and transport.  You call 311, 311 transfers the information to 911 and EMS (me) gets dispatched to the \"hypothermia\" call.  Keep in mind this can be done at an time regardless of whether or not code blue is in effect, and we will take anyone to the hospital for any reason.  The difference is, once code blue is in effect anyone out in the cold loses their legal right to refuse and if they don't want to be transported the call type is changed to a psychiatric emergence and NYPD is assigned to force the person to go against their will, which is fucking insane considering how many people are genuinely well prepared for the cold weather.  All month it has been the same thing, anyone who wants to go to the ER calls for assistance themselves or makes their way to a shelter, and then we get called repeatedly for the people who are sleeping on the streets but have enough blankets and shelter to be completely safe, we end up having to force them to go, and then when they get cleared from the ER a few hours later they are back on the streets without all of their cold weather supplies and sometimes a considerable distance from the place where they were camped out.  The homeless shelters are dangerous and most people avoid them, and the hospital will only keep them for a little while.  In the end code blue does not actually provide anyone with any kind of assistance that wasn't always available other than forcing the shelters to accept extra people, it is 99% just some bullshit PR stunt the mayors office pulls every ear to dodge the blame when a handful of homeless people inevitably die on the streets every winter.  Forced transports are usually not in the actual best interest of the person being transported most of the time, and its a massive waste of time and resources for EMS, NYPD, and the hospitals.  Honestly I'm not even sure how it is legal to remove a competent adults right to refuse medical treatment based on the weather, the closest thing to an explanation that I've gotten is that when its dangerously cold out a refusal to seek shelter is treated as a suicide attempt, but in reality that is complete nonsense.  If you are going to call, just go talk to the person first and ask them if they want help.  If they say yes, or are obviously unprepared or mentally/physically unfit, go ahead and make the call, but if you exchange a couple words with them and get the impression that they really are fine just leave them alone, most of the ones who choose to stay on the streets have been through multiple winters and are shockingly good at making it through without any outside help.",

There is no more forcing them to go via the EDP route unless they are not appropriately dressed for the weather or have other signs of being emotionally disturbed. Or homeless outreach or the NYPD say so. I'm sure no one in their right mind would leave someone who is in socks and boxers sleeping on the street that appears to be incoherent. When they were doing that last year, they got a lot of flack from civil liberties people. So now you just encourage them to go, if they say no write up the paperwork.",

This is the official FDNY policy as per many lieutenants, dispatchers and floored lieutenants at dispatch.\n\nFeel free to call up dispatch confirm if you like. If you don't have their number, p.m. me and I will send it to you.\n\nWhen you arrive at a cold or unknown or unconscious or drug or whatever other call type typically gets dispatched for the homeless... unless they seem like an EDP, approach them and ask them if they would like to go to the hospital. If they say no, ask them are they going to seek shelter and encourage them to go to the hospital. That's the bare minimum since they are human beings too. If they refuse, and homeless Outreach is not on scene? You are to write a 93 refused all. If homeless Outreach is on scene, as I understand it, the patient goes with you.  And only if they look as though they are indeed EDP and not capable of taking care of themselves due to their psychiatric illness, may you request PD so that the NYPD can EDP them and forcibly transport them to the hospital. Remember, the NYPD and homeless outreach are the only agencies capable of making someone in EDP. Not EMS.",

Granted we'd been talking for a semester and a half at this point and he was straight up with me and said:\n\n\"imma 'bout to commit some non violent crime and purposely get caught because you know what baby? Least I get three square some heat and a bed\"\n\nHe was no saint as he admitted and took full responsibility for his homelessness, but he was trying. He couldn't get a job because he didn't have an address and he absolutely was looking for work. I don't know why but here they make it so once you're in a hole, it's nearly impossible to get out of.\n\nThe homeless are real people. Some with mental illness, addictions, or just bad choices. We live in an amazing country here in America but healthcare and shelter should be a right, and basic human decency. \n\nI'm living paycheck to paycheck but there are people out there with zero..

Unfortunately, I've been seeing the transit police going around kicking them out at the end of the night. While I understand the reason for it, it's particularly sad considering how overfilled the shelters are around here. ",

Do you have any proof that this service is actually real and does what it is saying?  \nI am under the impression that pretty much everywhere wants their homeless to go away, shelters are always at max capacity, benches installed to prevent laying down being comfortable, people installing spikes n their door stoops, providing bus tickets to get them out of their sight,  police actively patrolling to prevent anyone from sleeping somewhere... the homeless are hated. It would seem like they wouldn't be terribly upset if they all froze to death, it would certainly solve all those pesky problems of the homeless existing and \"ruining their property values\"",

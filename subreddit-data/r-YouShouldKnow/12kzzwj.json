    "postText": "*Why YSK: To save you from losing money*\n\n**tl;dr below.** A few days ago I got charged two times by Uber for rides I never booked via PayPal. Changed my PayPal password and disputed the payments as unauthorized immediately.\n\nPayPal then closed that dispute relatively quickly, stating no signs of an unauthorized payment could be detected. I called them and had an agent explain to me, that since I had activated pre-approved payments for Uber a few years ago, PayPal deemed the payment as authorized. He stated that every payment made, using a pre-approved payment agreement, is never considered unauthorized. There was no option for me to further escalate or change the reason for the dispute.\n\nI then talked to Uber about it, they told me that, even though they have the exact transaction ID, the corresponding payment couldn\u2019t be found and that I should contact my bank.\n\nThis would result in fees and most likely a negative impact on my credit score *(may be different in your country, I\u2019m based in Germany)*, so that\u2019s not an option for me. Basically I\u2019m screwed out of the $25.\n\nI have now cancelled the pre-approved payments and revised all the dozens (literally!) others that accumulated over the past few years to hopefully prevent this from happening again. Obviously deleted my Uber account, too, after that atrocious customer support. \n\nThe PayPal agent told me to dispute the payment as \u201cproduct not received\u201d, should this happen again, so that (in my case) Uber has to prove they actually provided **me** the ride.\n\n**tl;dr** If you have accumulated pre-approved payment agreements on PayPal, revise them (settings). If an unknown payment was made using one, claim as \u201cproduct not received\u201d for a better chance of success.",

            "comment": "I had a similar case with paypal last year. I had ordered something through Etsy that was over $1k and the shop ended up shutting down due to the war in Ukraine. The seller communicated everything and provided tons o evidence for me to show what was going on and to get a refund. Opened a case through Paypal as \"Refund Requested\" and waited. After a week of investigation they denied my claim and closed the case stating that they \"never received documentation that proves you are due a credit\". Even though I had screenshots of the seller saying they're shutting down and to ask for a refund as well as Etsy message to them about shutting down their shop. I called the next day and the agent stated that I needed to file the claim as \"Product Not Received\". They were nice enough to re-open the case and change the category. I got my money back the next day. All this to say, Paypal is extremely strict on how they issue refunds. If you claim doesn't perfectly fit within their defined category, they will deny and you'll be SOL. Use with caution",

                    "comment": "YSK: use PayPal... They are so popular specifically because of how they side with buyers (most of the time). I work for an ecommerce  company with 30k+ thousand employees (in Tech alone), PayPal fucks us in the ass without any courtesy on the regular, and we have to take it because fuck do we need them more than they need us. They are doing us a favor by allowing us to use their API, we aren't doing them any favor by paying them the 1% they ask for and they make that abundantly clear in their attitude. \n\n\nBecause of how popular they are, you may see a lot of hate, but most smaller payment providers are way worse. Adyen/Klarna are decent too but they are definitely more focused on making their partners money, and the even smaller payment providers are so reliant on their business partners using them, that they will bend you over, you'll know when you Google their HQ and it's just full of  1 star reviews of people saying they were scammed. \n\nPayPal is not perfect, but much like democracy (well really constitionalism to be politically precise) it's the best we've got.",

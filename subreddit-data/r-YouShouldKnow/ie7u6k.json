    "postText": "There are a lot of parents with this philosophy of \"What I say goes, I'm the boss , everyone bow down to me, I can do no wrong\". \n\nThis approach is detrimental to raising children who take accountability for their own actions. They need to see you admit to your faults, and you do owe them an apology when you mess up, even if you happen to think that \"seems stupid because they're just a kid\". \n\nChildren learn by example, and they pick up on so many nuances, minutiae, and unspoken truths. \n\nYou aren't fooling them into thinking you're perfect by refusing to admit mistakes - you're teaching them that to apologise is shameful and should be avoided at all costs. You cannot treat a child one way and then expect them to comport themselves in the opposite manner.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nEDIT: uh, wow, this blew tf up. To address a few things from the comments:\n\n\n- I'm a 35 y/o mother to a 3 y/o, and I try to practice what I preach. I'm not a child psychology expert by any means, (I just play one on the internet...), but I have done a considerable amount of research over the years on various parenting styles and techniques, and new studies that come out regarding the long term effects of them. I defer to experts and scientists.\n\n\n- My father modeled a wonderful example by always apologizing and admitting when he was wrong, and it did not affect how we viewed him as the boss of the household. I also experienced the opposite with my biological mother, who is a clinically diagnosed Narcissist. \n\n\n- For everyone who can relate and who has a story to share, please know that I will try my best to respond to your comments; thank you for your bravery in sharing your experiences. \n\n\n*****\n\n\nThank you all so much for your kind words and the lovely shiny pixels, I'm so glad that this was well-received. Have a dope weekend, folks\ud83d\udda4",

Respect is considered the most important value of life, not love; I suspect it roots from the Christian ideals laid down in the Bible. Fear God, respect your parents.\n\nMy point is that \"safely raising their child to be the best person they can be\" is EXTREMELY subjective \u2014 we got the ''cage-free\" parents who might accidentally raise entitled little shits, religious asshats who create traumatized replicas or depressives, or somewhere in the middle. \n\nThe way my parents raised me is objectively shitty, but I still understand that parenting is extremely complex. My parents are \"being the adult they want me to be,\" \"safely raising their child to be the best person they can be,\" etc. according to the interpretations perhaps instilled in them by their parents.\n\ntldr; these little gems of advice don't mean shit because they're so subjective.",

If you try to be a perfect person, you're going to set unrealistic standards for the child. As long as you make an effort to correct your own behavior also when you're in the wrong (for whatever reason that may be) I'd say it's a good thing for them to know that even their parents get it wrong sometimes and even they let their emotions get the better of them. We're all human, we're all still figuring this out as we go. \n\nA parent being able to admit that they were wrong or that they didn't react to something as well as they could have can go a long way to teaching compassion, understanding and empathy. The parent is no longer an unquestionable force, but another human being just like the child. Granted the parent is a human being who's had enough experience to have a lot of answers, but not all of them and that's ok.\n\nSorry for rambling at you, I'm no expert and honestly mostly talking from personal experience. I've just always been extremely thankful for how my mom raised myself and my siblings, while at the same time having experience in an opposite extreme when left in the care of my biological father who's policy was \"because I said so\" and believed being a \"parent\" meant he could not be/do anything wrong.",

I can't remember my mom ever actually saying sorry to me over anything substantial, only if she bumped into me by accident or something but never for telling me if I don't want to live there I can get out and when I bring up how she treats my older brother better than me she just goes \"oh yeah bring that up again\". I fucking cry at night feeling unwanted by the only 2 people I've thought unconditionally cared about me my whole life.\n\n If my brother's coming over after work to visit for a couple hours and have supper with us my mom will constantly scream at me to do stuff so everything's perfect for him when he comes, but doesn't do half the work for me on actual occasions like my birthday. She'll say \"stop being jealous\" and it's like how? How do you not get jealous of people who have what you want and can't have? It's cruel to say stop because I'm a human being not a robot. \n\nI love my dad, he works so hard to support us and had a harder life in childhood but he won't tell my mom she's wrong ever and in private has told me \"even if you know you're right, just go along with what she says I'm tired of hearing so much fighting every day\". So I just have to accept that while I live with my parents it's 1984, my mom is big brother and what she says is right and what I say will always be wrong. My dad has everyone in my immediate family's name tattooed on him and just got my name on him a few years ago when I was like 18. It hurt the other day with him saying he wants to get my nephew's name tattooed on him when he's under 1 years old and it took him 18 years to get my name on him, his own son. \n\nI'd move out if that was an option, but I have no education and no skills and where I live is expensive to rent anywhere, leaving me kind of having to live with my parents for now or be homeless. I try to avoid my mom as much as I can but feel guilty that when she eventually passes away I'll regret not spending time with her even though she makes my blood boil all the time.",

Them forcing you to put them and your brother first before yourself has shaped the way your thinking has formed throughout your life. It has programmed your brain so that whenever you think about helping yourself a part of you says \"hey! think about your parents/brother!\". That's why you feel the guilt and obligation to them despite hating what they have done to you.\n\nYour feelings of guilt and obligation towards them are not truth. Those feelings do not come from god or the universe, they are not natural healthy instincts, they are not rational conclusions supported by the evidence. Those feelings are just damage. Just bad code programmed into your brain during development. You have no obligation to them. You have nothing to feel guilty about.\n\nThe chances of your parents changing are very small, you likely won't get relief there. You can work towards moving out, not being around them will take off some of the pressure, but they will still abuse you from afar. Your relief will come when you learn how to let go of the feelings they've put there and to undo the damage they did to your thinking.\n\nTherapy would help most, but I imagine hard to attain in your situation. Try to spend time thinking about and analysing your feelings, instead of thinking about your family. Whenever you become conscious of yourself thinking submissively towards your family stop and try to identify what changed your thoughts. You'll eventually identify the triggers, like that whenever you're thinking about doing something nice for yourself something happens and you start thinking about what you 'ought' to do for your family instead.\n\nFocus on that \"something happens\". Identify the feeling of your thoughts changing and then practise consciously rejecting that feeling. Re-start the process of thinking about the positive thing and this time force yourself to stay in that thought without thinking about your family. Do this enough and you can re-program the damage they did and free your mind from feeling that crushing sense of obligation.",

The above phrase is just the speaker's attempt to absolve themselves of their actions, words, or involvement in the situation(s) that negatively impacted the person to whom they're speaking. \n\nIn a genuine, sincere apology, the speaker owns up to what they did or said, they take responsibility for themselves; they verbally recognize how what they did or said negatively impacted the person to whom they're offering an apology, which shows empathy. \n\nAlso, it's not appropriate for them to ask for forgiveness, because (A) that selfishly turns the focus of the apology back on themselves, which comes across as looking for a form of absolution, and (B) the person to whom they're offering an apology has the right to reach a state of forgiveness in their own time, without being pressured or put on the spot. If person A asks person B, \"Do you forgive me?\", or, \"Can you forgive me?\", it's ok for person B to say something like, \"I thank you for your apology, that you've owned up to your (actions/words). I recognize that it's not easy to do. If I come to a place of forgiveness, it will be in my own time, and for my own peace of mind. I will do my best to not hang on to the (anger or other emotion) that I feel. I'll will work on interacting with you without anger, even though what you (did/said) is not ok with me.\" That's the point of forgiveness: one's own peace of mind. It's actually not for the other person. It's also ok to speak about your trust in that person has been affected.\n\nBottom line, if person A did wrong and negatively impacted person B, it's not up to person B to make person A feel better about themselves, or comfort them. Person B doesn't have to figuratively destroy person A, but they don't have to absolve them, either.",

We got in an argument where I called her crazy and she blew up and left the house with her boyfriend for three days.\n\n She comes back and when I'm still not talking to her, she tells me her boyfriends heart hurts (he has Marfans) and he's about to have a heart attack because I won't talk to them.

That's it, just don't touch it at all, no reason to go near it, it's in a room you don't use, do you understand? \"*Yeeeessss!*\" Do you promise you won't touch it? \"Yes yes I heard you!\"\n\nCame back and it was wrecked with bleach cleaner. It was brand new, no reason anyone would think it needed cleaning.\n\nI yelled a lot. Pointed out the only thing I asked her to do before I left was not touch it. After like 5 minutes of trying to invent excuses the best I got was and extremely sarcastic \"Well sor*REEE*\". She actually believes that counts as an apology. And that's the only time I've heard the word sorry come out of her mouth in my life.",

It has worked well, as my kids are pretty chill. \n\nWell all of that went out of the window today. I found myself getting easily flustered and showing my annoyance with them. \n\nI felt guilty since I rarely lose my shit. So, after I calmed down and we were having a casual conversation, I apologized to them. I explained vaguely about hormones and to please bear with me. \n\nMy daughter, who is 7, responded with, \u201cIt\u2019s ok mom, I get it. I lose my patience with my brother and little sister too sometimes. You\u2019re a great mom and I love you.\u201d \n\nMelted my little heart! I felt like I taught her the life lesson of empathy? Is that stretching it? To see things or relate? Basically to not take things personal, which is something I struggled with up until pretty recently. \n\nI hope I can continue to teach my children these little lessons. My goal is not instill any unhealthy thoughts or habits, and not to pass down any of my traumas.",

They never treated her as a child that needs to do as told but as a little human being who needed their help and guidance to explore the world and herself. Their daughter was always a full member of the family and her opinion mattered just as much as her parent's opinion. Sometimes they had an argument and they would never dismiss her, instead they listened to her and when they were wrong they would tell her. She also had a lot of privacy. When she was young and had friends over to play they would go to her bedroom and her parents would always knock on the door before entering. Their reasoning was just because she's small doesn't mean she's not entitled to her privacy. The other side of the coin was they taught her her actions have consequences and to be mindful of other people, their opinions and how they perceive the world. Their daughter is 16 now and highly independent, has a great sense of empathy and a wisdom you will only find in someone who is raised this way.",

He and I were fine going forward the next few days, it seemed to have been forgotten by him.  A few days later I realized that I had overreacted and felt really bad about it, so at bedtime I asked my son if he remembered a few nights ago when I blew up at him for the small thing.  Before I had said this he was happy and excitedly telling me about his day.  Well he did remember that night and me bringing it up made him tear up as he was remembering it and the. I apologized.  I explained how it was wrong for me to get that mad over the small thing and how I won't let that happen again and a smile came upon his face despite his eyes being full of tears and from his own heart he said it's ok dad I still love you, and he thanked me for apologizing.  It was an amazing moment and it forever changed me.  100% follow this ysk but don't take it for granted....the thing you're admitting is still wrong and if you don't avoid making the same mistake you will teach distrust.

If you don't agree or your logic is different, there's something wrong with it somewhere\". As a kid I was always wrong in everything. All arguments, even those which are based on actual logic are wrong. And his reason is because \"I know better\" or \"you'll understand when you grow up\" or \"you should know better\" while insisting he was right and I was wrong. Then he made me \"acknowledge\" that I was wrong by making me verbally admit that I was wrong and giving me a form of punishment afterwards.\n\nEventually I learned to accept that I'll never be able to prove that what I did was right or defensible as long as he has so much as an inkling of wanting to prove me wrong in whatever it may be. What I did then was to just \"accept\" fault but never really internally accept it. I'm very rebellious (though idk if that's because of my childhood experiences with him or if I'm just naturally rebellious as a person) and will never back down and give in deep inside, but would concede the argument on the outside just to end any more exhausting pointless drama.\n\nI resolved to myself that when I grow up, HE is exactly the type of person I wouldn't want to become, and that when I have kids, I wouldn't out them through what he put me through, cause kids definitely don't deserve to go through that shit at such a young age. I felt like my innocence as a kid was trampled upon, sort of like emotional abuse. So I made him to be an example of what NOT to be like, if that makes sense.",

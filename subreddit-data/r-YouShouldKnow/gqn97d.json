We also use masks at work for the safety of our customers and *their* customers.\n\nFor the last week I've been doing my job without glasses. Which is extremely tedious since even though my prescription is light my astigmatism is insane. So I can't read the check-digits on my picks until I get super close and I'm squinting like fucking Mr Magoo. Really a major time killer.\n\nAnd since I get bonuses based on productivity and efficiency, you've helped me earn more money.\nThank you!\n\nI've donated $5 to planned Parenthood in your honor.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/7SdK15e",

I can't see, smell, taste, or breathe. I flail around and mistake bumping into the onions at the store with bumping into people and I yell at the onions for breaking social distancing. I taped my hands into bottles of hand sanitizer, so I can't easily pick anything up, but again, it helps cut down on buying junk food.\n\nI ended up accidentally buying just ten pounds of onions at the store. I guess I kept going in circles and returning to the onions. I supplant my daily onion diet with extra large all-meat pizzas delivered. I've only gained two pounds per day since this whole thing started, but I'm sure losing weight is as easy as gaining weight, so I'm sticking with the onion soup and grease pizzas for now.",

There is someone on here saying to try it with your contacts, please do not do that. Just make sure you are using plain blue Dawn soap and a microfiber cloth. Don\u2019t use a T-shirt or anything that may have fabric softener on it because that WILL damage coatings and sometimes makes them crack. Fabric softener also will create a film on your glasses that\u2019s impossible to remove. Be gentle and use your fingers under cold water to scrub the lens and then use the microfiber cloth to dry off. You can buy one at target or Walgreens or Walmart.",

I\u2019ve never seen anyone use Palmolive so I am not at liberty to say that that one is necessarily bad for your lenses. If you\u2019ve experienced no problems then continue using it. I actually hand wash my microfiber cloths with dish soap too, I forgot to add that part.\n\n2. I try to stay away from anything cloth or tissue unless it was made for glasses. Sometimes there can be tiny embedded particles in them that can scratch glasses, which is why I tell people to never use a T-shirt or clothing to clean their glasses.  Face tissue also can have lotions and oils added to it even if it\u2019s not advertised, and that can possibly damage lenses. \n\n3. Keep rubbing. I\u2019m sorry that sounded dirty. But microfiber cloths can be a little bit stubborn so you do you need to scrub gently a little. It\u2019s tedious but your glasses will thank you in the long run! And to add on to my first answer, microfiber cloths should never be put in the washing machine. Hand wash with a little bit of dish soap and hang to dry.",

When it came time to do the actual space walk the soap irritated his eyes and he began to tear up, but because of the extremely low gravity in space the tears couldn't flow down his face and just \"pooled\" in his eyes, so they ended up having to cut it short due to the balls of soap tears in his eyes.\n\nIf I remember correctly I think they just used standard off the shelf Dawn dishsoap, so I wonder if baby shampoo would have worked better.",

You might be able to remove tonsil stones by scraping gently with water picks or swabs.\n&gt; - *Saltwater gargles*. Gargling with warm, salty water may help ease the pain of tonsillitis and help remove stones.\n\n\nSo now you know! Severely bad breath can be caused by tonsil stones, and can be removed at home (you have to be persistent though!) with e.g. (soft!) Q tips, saltwater to gargle, and a syringe to squirt water at them!",

                            "comment": "Just open your mouth wide, close your nose/throat tight, and put a finger into the side of your mouth next to a tonsil (right index finger for right tonsil, or left index finger for left tonsil), then push your finger forward along your tonsil (push in the direction your finger is pointing, towards the back of your throat, rolling over the tonsil). Anything in there will pop out on to the tip of your finger. You're basically putting a finger at the bottom of a tonsil pocket and pushing the pocket shut from the bottom to the top, forcing out whatever was in the pocket. And there's more than one pocket per tonsil but generally one swipe across will cover all of them but not always.\n\nKeeping the area tight will help you not gag. And you might still gag. But you won't have a giant rotting ball of shit in your mouth anymore.\n\nIt is possible to have a stone so big that it doesn't come out immediately. If so, I find the first try will make it swell up a bit and the second try will get it out with the extra pressure.\n\nAll this other info about gargling this and that, massaging things, qtips... maybe you'll get something. But I just stick a finger in there, pop it out, and that's the end of it. Immediately. \n\nIt's a bitch but it works.\n\n[Here's a diagram from MS Paint.](https://i.imgur.com/bZmT6MP.png) lol.\n\nedit:\n\n[Diagram 2](https://i.imgur.com/RqBCv98.png)\n\n[Diagram 3](https://i.imgur.com/Ao6cbKv.png)\n\nDiagram 3 Notes:\n\nThe X marks the side of the tonsils.\n\nPut your finger in your mouth with your fingerprint touching the side of your mouth, your fingertip touching the X, nail on the inside.\n\n1 - Keep pressure towards the outside. Like you're trying to dig under and pop your tonsil off the side of your mouth.\n\n2 - Push your fingertip into the X and push towards the back of your mouth.\n\n3 - When the tonsil gets fully squished between the tip of your finger and the back of your mouth, move your fingertip off the back of your mouth and in this direction to roll the crap from the inside to the outside of the pockets.",

I just do this every few months, and maybe 80% of the time it's just some goo but 20% I get a little stone and think yep, it's no fun but that's why I do this.\n\nThe first few times I got some stones that were like half a fingernail or a full fingernail in size. Actually stuck in there pretty good, it took a few attempts. Just gross. My throat actually felt more open afterwards when swallowing.\n\nWhen you have them that big they'll probably bleed a swell up a bit at first and then be less inflamed than before in a couple days. Like flossing.",

That seems to do the trick for me. I just get a really muted gag at worst.\n\nAnd I put my finger down next to the tonsil and *then* push into it, rather than poking the tonsil head on. You can sort of brace for the feeling and not push as hard if a gag comes. \n\nNow that I do it somewhat regularly I don't really gag anymore. It's worth the gag if you really have something in there. One of the first times I did this I got a stone that was like the size of a fingernail and I thought holy shit that's so gross, from now on I'm doing this no matter how bad it feels.\n\nIt does get easier though, especially once your tonsils are healthier from not having a big rock in there all the time.",

The stones don't form due to bacteria, they form due to accumulation of food debris and sloughed off skin in the crypts of tonsils. Bacteria thrive in the environment and contribute to the odor. The best oral hygiene doesn't do much for tonsilloliths - they are just a result of having cryptic tonsils. Poor oral hygiene can cause breath odor, but that can't compete with someone with multiple tonsil stones.",

If they get moved then you can express them with your fingers if they are stuck or whatever. \n\n Its a little uncomfortable and your nose and eyes will water and youre doing it right if you can shoot snot rockets after the cap is empty. If youve ever had an abcess though its totally worth it compared to that hell.",

How willing surgeons are to do a tonsillectomy for recurrent stones/ halitosis/irritation will vary place to place. \n\nThe biggest issue with tonsillectomy is that the tonsils sit over the carotid artery. You can cut it during the surgery or it can came open when the eschar at the surgery site breaks loose and opens up the artery in the days after the surgery. While the complication rate is low, there's a good chance you'll die if it happens.",

I saw an ENT and he agreed that my tonsils (and adenoids) should be removed. The recovery was the most awful experience of my life in terms of discomfort, but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nNo more bad breath and rarely have so much as a sore throat. Breathing and sleep improved as well. \n\nBefore my tonsil removal, I had a decent system for removing tonsil stones. I used a water pick on a low setting to flush them out. For those interested, just be very careful. The tissue on your tonsils can be sensitive, so you should avoid using high pressure water. The gag reflex was hard to overcome, but it became more tolerable eventually. \n\n100% recommend to anyone considering having their tonsils removed. Just be aware that recovery is generally more difficult for adults. Have lots of liquid food options available. Oh, and once you can eat solid food again, it will be the best meal of your life!

                                    "comment": "I believe it would be considered a minor surgery. I was told by the ENT that it generally takes more time for adults to recover than say a young child. I can't speak to the experience of someone who had their tonsils removed as a child and their recollection of the recovery process, but I can't imagine it would have been overly pleasant either.\n\nI want to say it was close to 3 weeks or so before I was able to get solid food down without it being very painful to swallow. I think they used a laser to cauterize the sites of removal. If I remember correctly, it was recommended to eat liquid/soft foods for 'X' amount of time and then eventually it lightly toasted bread at 'Y' point in time. I feel that was to encourage scabbing to sluff off.\n\nI can only elaborate on the fact that even drinking cold water was painful at first. Some liquids like tomato soup and protein shakes stung quite a bit when going down, I'm sure in part because of certain ingredients within them. I just remember temperature sensitivity being a thing.\n\nOne thing that helped take the edge off, apart from the Tylenol 3's, were Cepacol throat lozenges. They have a numbing effect. I wasn't a fan of the T3's as they made me nauseous even when following the recommended dosage.\n\nI imagine everyone has a different experience but for me it was a slow and painful recovery. This is coming from someone who has always felt like they have a relatively high tolerance for pain.",

She said once I'm able to get both down, I'm clear to leave the hospital. Within minutes I drank the juice and ate all of the ice. She was concerned when she caught me walking by myself to the washroom shortly after because the general anesthetics take time to wear off. I told her I felt great, and I was released.\n\nI had a friend take me to a Wal-mart to fill my prescription for the pain killers and to get some recovery foods. Still feeling a-okay.\n\nWell....by the time I was dropped off, the anesthetics wore off completely as I walked to my front door. The pain hit me like a truck. Funny thing though...I had ordered a onesie through Amazon as my fun/comfy recovery outfit. It was on my doorstep, so that was nice at least haha",

They were never not inflamed enough to do the procedure, as I wasn\u2019t ever well enough. I was on antibiotics my entire young childhood because of it, I was always sick and miserable with swollen tonsils. Every now and then while scratching my throat because they always \u201citched\u201d by making a horrible noise a stone would dislodge. It would freak me out that a hard stinky thing would pop out. I never told anyone about those, I thought it was too weird and they\u2019d laugh at me like I was crazy. Later, my husband dug one out (and does regularly with a special tool) and I learned they were common.\n\nAnyway, after a (short) lifetime of pink penicillin, and constantly being sick from them, (I\u2019m 46 now and remember it all vividly still) they decided I needed them out. I remember waking up feeling groggy, and feeling the stitches in the back of my throat. (my friend got hers out shortly after and they used lasers, I think her recovery was slightly easier than mine). I felt ok, no pain\u2026 Then the nurse brought me a popsicle, and it was ok, but I was super annoyed by the stitches scratching at my throat, and feeling my uvula super swollen and touching the back of my tongue. I felt fine, with no concept of painkillers\u2026 Out of nowhere, I had to vomit. I barfed in the little plastic thing they gave me, and it was all the remnants of my tonsils that slid down my throat. They were still so inflamed and destroyed from being sick all the time the doctor said they disintegrated as they removed them, and they couldn\u2019t get all of my adenoids because of the inflammation. So to this day, I still get a flare up of my adenoids getting inflamed and \u201citchy\u201d but it\u2019s very very rare. \n\nI still felt OK until the next day, back then it was an overnight stay. They said the nearly the same thing to me, they\u2019d release me after I drank a cup of water\u2026 But the next day, I felt like I got hit by that infamous train, the surgical pain relievers had worn off. I felt like that for over a month. I couldn\u2019t drink the water, even without ice crying because it hurt so bad. Eventually the compromise was to try and eat another popsicle and a cup of ice chips. I wasn\u2019t released until nearly 3pm. It was so bad, and the nurses were getting upset with me and my parent were trying not to get annoyed because I couldn\u2019t swallow my own spit let alone some melty popsicle.  It burned, it throbbed, the stitches were awful and I kept gagging on my own uvula. I swear to this day they must\u2019ve nicked it during surgery. I cried and cried it was so bad. It took over a month to feel better, I recall the first solid food I ate after a few weeks was a tiny bowl of mashed potatoes. My friend only had a two week recovery. It hurt but I couldn\u2019t take drinking/eating jello anymore. Then the dealing scabs got super annoying. It was a horrible recovery, but it was 100% worth it. Instead of messing up my immune system, getting rid of them helped 1000 fold. I still got sick like kids do with colds and flu, but not like before and then destroying it more with rounds and rounds of antibiotics. As an adult, I take lots of probiotics to help my compromised gut biome (Doc did a test, my flora is horrible due to my constant childhood antibiotics) and my immune system is pretty darn good now considering the damage. \n\nIt was such an experience, it was the worst pain of my life even after getting dry socket in all four wisdom teeth extraction sites in my mid-20s. I\u2019ve only had one experience worse, with a lengthy recovery but it still ranks as the top 2.",

I got through the surgery just fine but when the scabs started coming off I did have a few spontaneous hemorrhages, they were terrifying but obviously they weren't deadly as I'm still here. I was suffering so bad I willingly went into it knowing I could die and a few times I thought I would. \n\nAfter I healed I could breathe easier in the daytime and at night (my tonsils were at least twice as big as normal and even impeded daytime breathing) I got far fewer sore throats and other illnesses and things didn't get caught in my tonsils. I could also drink and eat without a horrid taste. The stones in deep crevices I couldn't get out and the infection pockets flavored whatever i consumed. So for me the risk and recovery was worth it.",

Notably, it smelt exactly what bad breath smells like.\n\nEver since I do a spot check every few days. I'd say one a month I'll see a small one forming and I've gotten good at being able to grab it with my finger nail, or gently apply pressure to push it out of its crevice. Qtips work as well.

The stones are basically globs of bacteria which begin to decay. For most people they aren't a big deal. If they get them at all, they will usually just flush out naturally and you won't ever know they were there. However, some people have deeper crypts (or pockets) in the tonsils which allow the stones to build up and grow. If this is you, over time you will start to feel like you have something stuck in the back of your throat, and your breath with progressively smell worse. \n\nI typically use a dental syringe to flush they crypts of my tonsils about once a week using water from a reverse osmosis system (distilled water would be the ideal choice). Be cause I do this regularly, my stones tend to have more of a white color, and the odor is minimal. \n\nSome people have success removing them by using a Q-Tip or toothbrush to apply gentle pressure to dislodge them. For people who get them bad, you may need to be a bit more aggressive to remove them. Although you need to be very careful not to scratch or poke your tonsils. Doing so could lead to a sore throat, or possibly an infection.",

And it's great to have some at-home remedies to try if you do experience them. I think it's important to emphasize the gentle nature of the removal methods though, as the tonsils are sensitive and can easily be injured.",

Google claims that it's the studios that restrict this and high traffic issues since the start of 2020, but 2+ years later, it's still the same. https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3306741?hl=en",

They don't make enough money off one time purchases to offset the cost to host the UHD/4k servers. \n\nMy issue is that it isn't abundantly clear when buying these movies that you can only watch them at the purchased quality on apps, not web. That should be in bold letters when you buy the movie, its predatory. It's almost as if they'd rather have you sail the seas than use their services.",

Even when HL2 came out people were iffy and a lot just bought retail disk copies. \n\nEven if it was overblown at the time (I'm *way* too young to have been using steam in 2003, so I wouldn't know) it was still how it was known back then.\n\n(Just a cool tidbit for some reason people on reddit have been really on edge these past few weeks so I just wanna make sure you know I'm sharing a fun fact and not trying to start an argument)",

I think the crappiness was what clued Gabe in - DRM only delays pirating and doesn't stop it, so Steam needed to become a platform for good service as well as for rights management",

    "postText": "Why YSK: When we hear these things, especially when growing up, we can think it's a perfectly normal idea, and we just accept it as right. We learn that we have no right to be upset, if we're upset about anything, we assume we're \"just being sensitive.\"  If we tell somebody something they've done has hurt us and they say \"it was just a joke\", we shut down and accept that as a completely reasonable explanation, and allow them to continuously hurt us with their \"jokes.\", because /obviously/ we can't be upset, let alone remove someone from our lives, for a simple \"joke.\"\n\n  \nIt can be extremely helpful to your own healing to learn that this is not normal, and it's not just \"kind of shitty\" either, it is literally gaslighting. Even though it might look different from the gaslighting you see in movies, it still has the same extremely negative effects on our mental health and sense of reality.  If you've been through this, you might want to google the effects of gaslighting.  You might also want to google childhood emotional neglect, emotional abuse, and CPTSD, because gaslighting is often the tip of the iceberg",

I imagine there are some, but my \"what is healthy\" compass is so out of wack after 24 years of this type of gaslighting (and worse), so I can't think of any.\n\nFor the second one, I struggle to see when it is valid.  We don't choose how we feel.  When someone says \"it's just a joke\", what they mean is \"therefore, don't feel the way you feel.\"  It doesn't matter if what you did is \"just a joke\", it still caused that other person pain or discomfort or upset.  Just because you think they shouldn't be upset at the joke, doesn't change the fact that they are upset at the joke.  It isn't necessarily abuse, but at the very least it is still not healthy. You don't get to tell other people how to feel, which is why \"you're too sensitive\" is generally unhealthy too.\n\nI understand why you feel like they're valid, but have you really taken the time and thought about it?  Or do you just feel like those phrases are valid because you've been around them so much they're normalized?",

                            "comment": "&gt;Can you give me any examples of when \"you're too sensitive\" is valid\n\nWhen a person's response is disproportionate to the offense. \n\nWhen a person's response fails to see intended positive connotations and instead focuses on negative ones. You see this in people that have been hurt by others. Sometimes those people will be overly defensive which makes them super sensitive to perceived attacks. \n\n\n\n&gt;For the second one, I struggle to see when it is valid. We don't choose how we feel.\n\nThe Stoics would like a word. \n\n&gt;When someone says \"it's just a joke\", what they mean is \"therefore, don't feel the way you feel.\n\nOr they could mean that you are taking things the wrong way or to an extreme. People can get really mad at things they don't understand. I'm sure you have had someone not get sarcasm. \n\n&gt;You don't get to tell other people how to feel, which is why \"you're too sensitive\" is generally unhealthy too.\n\nYes we do. At least to the degree to which they can feel certain feelings. \n\n&gt;but have you really taken the time and thought about it?\n\nYes I have. Example: If I was overly sensitive I could take this comment as a personal attack on my intelligence. I choose to see your comment with the best intentions as there is no direct indication that I am right. \n\nExample: I eloped with my wife. An uncle that made a joke during some wedding event that my wife and I had gotten married in sin. A family member heard the comment and was wrongly primed into thinking they looked down on us for doing it. So much so that she missed that he was making fun of people that did. She was wrong. She was being overly sensitive and didn't get the joke. The uncle in question had even eloped with his wife. I literally said the words \"You're too sensitive\", and \"it was a joke\" to her. She carried on denying it and accusing the guy of being a bigot until I mentioned he eloped",

We were in a voice call and I was making the same kinda jokes we always do. I left and by the time I came back wasnt in the call. I asked them if they removed me from the call. They told me that the jokes weren\u2019t helping their game and they said to shut up multiple times. I apologized for reading the room wrong and pointed out that we always do that though. Like constantly tell each other to shut the fuck up sarcastically. I misread the tone and apologized. Still felt a bit off though cuz they were still lecturing and I had jokes done to me where I seriously asked them to stop only for them to double down so I called out the hypocrisy and a full argument broke out. \n\nThroughout the argument I apologized like 4 times for upsetting them and resolved to do better going onwards and in the end asked them for one boundary after they pushed my buttons too during the convo. First time in years of friendship I did that. The friend didnt apologize once for upsetting me in return however and in the end threw the word \u201cgaslighting\u201d at me. Thats when I muted and walked off. Ive catered to them for years. Walked on egg shells and even begged them back into my life before. \n\nI took responsibility for my misstep, apologized, resolved to do better, and asked for one thing from their side and I got told that Im Gaslighting them.",

And then I'm like wait, doesn't this mean you were gaslighting me then, trying to make me believe that I was crazy for thinking this was Jennifer Connolly. \"Nope\"\n\nThis was a very social justicey person. I think that was the last time I tried to accommodate or understand the use of the term gaslighting, and instead saw it as just code for \"you did something I don't like and I'm trying to make you feel bad\". \n\nPeople who bandy this expression about likely only think its usage is valid when they're the victim.

That's part of why I made this, and part of why I was planning on another YSK: relationships are supposed to make you feel good, including and especially your relationship with your parents.  It took me until I was 24 to realize, if literally ANYBODY had told me this shit when I was 16 instead, my entire life could have been different.  I had like 100 people come speak at my school, how come none of them explained that you're supposed to get (primarily, although not exclusively) positive emotions out of a relationship?  I got lucky and stumbled into a healthy-enough relationship in college, and it was sort of weird because they just made me feel good all the time?  And never hurt me (on purpose, and only like a few times on accident, which they apologized for)?????",

Not everything is black and white and people can be too sensitive. i've reacted too extreme on something that was meant as a joke simply because I didn't see it. Once you get told you can asses and see it was actually not that bad and even funny.",

The real world has certain expectations for behavior and they\u2019re complicated, so parents can\u2019t always explain why something is important.

YouTube how to do it and you could save yourself thousands. People who sell cars can be sketchy and are good are hiding previous damage or mechanical problems. Pro Tip: offer to meet at the sellers house/dealer and ask them to not start it because you want to do a \u201ccold start\u201d which is starting the engine right up after it\u2019s been sitting. Lots of mechanical problems can \u2018hide\u2019 or \u2018disappear\u2019 once the engine is warmed up. Starting it cold gives you a much better idea as to how it\u2019ll work when you bring it home the next day. Best of luck!",

Some won't tell you at all, but look at the readiness monitors (for emissions). If most or all are marked \"not ready\" they've likely been cleared recently.\n\nEdit: Meant to update this earlier, Permanent trouble codes cannot be ereased on a car. That's what I meant when I was saying \"some won't allow codes to be cleared (CAN-BUS emissions).\" Excuse the confusion/ambiguity.",

I later learned that letting that sensor go might have resulted in no fuel mixture corrections, and potential damage to the catalytic converter. \n\nThis was far better than the $300+ alternative that the shop would have likely sold me (2x the price, plus 2 hours @$90/hour due to diagnostics and the actual repair). \n\nPlus, with the OBDII tool, if the problem was something I was just unable to fix, no one could rake me over the coals saying that I needed more than just the sensor.",

When we scan codes it just gives you a general idea of what is wrong and then you have to go find the actual problem to fix it. Like it could be a broken wire, a short to ground or voltage somewhere. And with these newer cars, some modules control and communicate with over a dozen different modules so if one starts getting fucky then it can fuck another one up and you think it's the second one when it was actually the first one lol if the Torque app can actually give you a decent guesstimation on what's wrong, that would be better than any code scanner I've ever seen.",

It only eventually got fixed because one of the technicians who wasn't working on my car overheard and believed me.",

Having a neutral third party helps with that anxiety.\n\nAlso I had quite a few not message me back after the request, which is super sketch. One even got angry. Nope, no thanks. If you're not confident in an neutral third party inspection you're most likely trying to conceal something, or at least will be unpleasant to deal with. Especially if you're paying for it and not asking anything of them.\n\nMy guy was super into the idea, read the report, agreed about everything and immediately reduced the price by what the small repairs would be.

To do this you'd have to take off the head. \n\nAlthough saying that, the mechanic might have picked up signs that the car may have not been very well maintained or mistreated by previous / current owner?? \n\nI had a similar situation, bought a mk4 golf GTI that had decent milage and a fair price. It was a private sale and I shouldve known something was up when the person I met was this elderly gentleman. Odd because he didn't look like the kind of guy that would drive a hot hatch AND the name on the papers was not the name he introduced. I thought whatever, its a steal and the car looked in a great shape. Fast forward a year and I get the check engine light, had it diagnosed and it was a boost leak, no biggy, very common for this car and age, I get cracking and fix it. The real bomb came when I took the car in for its 2nd MOT inspection, when I went to pick up the car the mechanic asked if I knew the car was involved in a crash before?! Not only that the true milage was over 150k (showed 89k when I bought it)! Never felt so dumb in my life, if it's too good to be true it generally is. I've learnt my lesson to always do my due diligence when it comes to buying a used car. Get the car checked out by a professional if you are not comfortable doing it yourself AND checked it's service history. A car is generally worth it if it has a solid service history.",

This advice is hit or miss. Firstly, the store will not let you do it yourself. A person working there will have to come out and scan it themselves. Depending on the store you could be waiting 10-15 minutes for someone to be free and be able to do so. Also, with COVID going on, lots of stores have suspended this service to minimize contact. Secondly, depending on who does it/how busy they are, you may only get a print out of the codes and have to look them up yourself. Just because someone works at a parts store, doesn't mean they know dick about cars. Working at a parts store is the same as working at any other retail store. They are there to sell you parts and that's it. I was the exception to the rule. I've been working on cars since I could hold a wrench so I could at least give some advice. If someone came in and they had a P0301 code indicating a misfire on cylinder one, I would usually tell them \"Hey, you have a misfire on cylinder one meaning something isn't working right to make the gas combust. Could be a spark plugs, could be a coil, could be an injector.\" Ultimately, I wasn't allowed to diagnose/try to fix their problem because someone could just buy a spark plug to fix the problem, and then come back later to try and sue or freak out because it turned out to be something more serious, and now their car is broken and we've scammed them and made their car break. \n\nSo yes, this advice *can* work, but be aware that this service is offered for the store to sell you a part that you may or may not need so they can make money. If you don't know what you're doing, just take it to a mechanic who does so you aren't wasting money throwing parts at a problem.",

You may be able to pull history, but that\u2019s not gonna be doable with the handheld garbage at most auto parts stores. Even so, if you get a code in history that isn\u2019t a diagnosis. You still have to have someone work down the diagnostic flow chart unless they\u2019ve got some sort of crystal ball. \n\nI should also note that having your Check Engine Light scanned at Autozone is the equivalent of having your chest x-ray done at Walmart. \n\nFind a reputable mechanic, pay their fee, and have them look over the car for you. Ask them to show you any problems BEFORE you purchase the car. If it\u2019s used, expect there to be minor issues. Most dealers know and understand this practice and the reputable ones won\u2019t bat an eye. If the dealer doesn\u2019t want your own mechanic to examine the car then walk away. \n\nSource: 18 years in the car business as a mechanic, shop manager, store manager, dispatcher, and service manager.",

    "postText": "Some people think that declawing is a simple surgery that removes a cats nails, this is not true. Declawing involves amputation of the last bone of each toe, removing claws changes the way a cats foot meets the ground and can cause pain similar to wearing an uncomfortable pair of shoes. There can also be regrowth of improperly removed claws, nerve damage and bone spurs. Most cats will become biters because they no longer have their claws as a defense. Cats scratch to remove dead husks from their claws, mark territory and stretch muscles.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s something worse than this: when the tendons are cut to the claws so they can\u2019t move them anymore, also done to prevent furniture scratching. I adopted a cat that had this done to him, and since he couldn\u2019t flex his claws to scratch anymore they would grow into his pads.\n\nI got very good at removing old claw sheaths and trimming claws though. Thank goodness he was a chill cat that understood that I was trying to help him. He would always be very still while I worked.",

My sister always tells about the time she and her boyfriend of the time were over visiting, and were chatting in the kitchen; he walked in and looked up at them. My sister said to him, \u2018oh, I think she\u2019s in the living room\u2019, and she swears he *nodded* before walking into the living room to find me. \n\nHe liked to go on walks with me - and by walks, I mean I carried him and did a lot of the walking, but he would beg to come with me, and he was so cute I couldn\u2019t say no. He also would come with me to work some days and nap behind my computer. I think his attitude was mostly, \u2018well, if my human likes it, I should probably try it too.\u2019",

The solution isn't surgically altering them so they can't. \n\nDon't let your cute little kitten think it's okay to bite and scratch the fuck out of you, because it's going to grow into a cat that thinks it's okay to bite and scratch the fuck out of you. \n\nI don't have a cat, but I have a dog and it's the same thing. There are behaviours that are adorable in baby animals, but dangerous/destructive or irritating when they're fully grown.

Someone at my church had been feeding her out of pity during November and December in Ohio, but they didn't want an indoor cat. They put up posters and tried to find the owner with no luck. They asked if I wanted her. I couldn't have a cat on my college campus, but I took her anyway because she was declawed in ALL FOUR PAWS. I couldn't stand the idea of her being a street cat with no claws.\n\nOn her first vet trip in January, I learned that she was only about six months old, was declawed x4, and was not spayed. Some asshole had put a kitten through surgery for declawing, didn't spay her, and then let her loose. I don't know what that person was thinking, and I don't know what kind of vet agreed to do that to a kitten. Assholes, the both of them.\n\nWe ended up taking in four more cats because I'm a sucker, and she was the most antisocial. She was very, very nervous about the other cats. She also fell off surfaces a lot because she couldn't grip when she jumped into the furniture. We finally had to put her down due to failing kidneys about 2.5 years ago at the ripe old age of almost 18. She was a cranky old bitch of a cat to most everyone besides me, but I don't blame her. She was the first cat we got, she hated all of our other cats, and she managed to hang in there long enough to be the last cat out of that group. Miss you, Emily Dickinson.",

It is one of the most cruel things you could do to an animal. And what happens if they go outside and they can't defend themselves?\n\n\nokay, I'm going to make a little edit here because I started reading some comments and apparently this is being taken the wrong way. I do not believe in letting your cats outside if you live in the suburbs or city for many reasons. I'm talking about a cat accidentally escaping when the door was open like if a mover was moving a couch in or something like that. Ideally you'll be responsible enough to not let that happen but it could happen. That's why we microchip cats even though they're going to be indoor cats. Jesus.\n\n\nthere are plenty of ways to make sure your cat doesn't scratch the furniture in case anyone is reading this. First you need to introduce scratching posts the very same day you bring the cat into your home.\n\nSecond you need to get pheromone spray and deterrent spray. It'll cost you about 50 bucks or so but it works. I can attest to that. I sprayed the deterrent spray at my kitty when I moved into my new place and she started scratching my new couches. It took three times and she never scratched them again.\n\nCatnip spray will attract the cats to the scratch pad and away from your furniture.\n\npheromone spray doesn't smell at all to us, but if you spray it on your furniture the cat will feel uneasy and be deterred from scratching the sides of your furniture. It essentially makes your cat think, \"oh I already scratched here I don't need to mark my territory or scratch my claws here.\" \nbecause they don't just scratch to sharpen their claws, they scratch to leave their scent.\n\n It's a wise investment.",

My mom went to the vet quite frequently at the time because they were trying different things, and a couple of times it meant she was a little late or took off a little early. She always made up for it by staying later or coming in earlier. (They were allowed to do that, as long as they worked their hours) \n\nThen one day when she came in a little later, her boss coldly said \u201cdon\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you have that dog put down?\u201d \n\nI will forever want to egg his house for that.

This is true both for the cat and for public health. \n\nIf an owner wants to de-claw the cat but is unable to, they are much more likely to abandon it. The lifespan of a cat in the wild is like 2-3 years. They die most often through pretty unpleasant means like getting hit by cars, killed by other animals, disease, or starvation. And, if they aren't spayed/neutered, they will likely produce many more cats who will meet the same end.\n\nVets who do de-claw typically counsel the owners first and let them know that it is not good for the cat, may cause lifelong complications, and that they should consider adopting them out if they can't deal with it. But some people will insist on it and will go to another vet if they say no. It isn't like these vets (most of them) are just being unethical, they have a reason why they perform it. Many vets won't do it though for all the reasons stated in this thread.\n\nEdit: please consider not de-clawing your cat. There are better options in most cases. If you can't deal with a cat's tendency to scratch, consider training, nail caps, or a different species of pet. Also don't abandon your cat if it scratches things, it is a cat. They scratch things.\n\nEdit 2: here is an American Vet Med Association white paper discussing the human/animal benefits, drawbacks, and risks of de-clawing: [link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/declawing_bgnd.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi89prS0J_qAhVYQ80KHe4FCxcQFjAMegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ypuEaXjxmjV2uQNwaSuZH). One finding in the paper shows that of cat owners, 50% would \"no longer own\" their cat if it were not declawed. Granted that study is from 1991, but I'd imagine that number is still double-digit.",

They\u2019ll play with a bird or any other prey to the brink of death, absolutely terrifying the poor animal and not necessarily killing it in the end, but leaving it to die.

He wasn't trying to hurt a cat but protect his other one and give another one a home. Thats how we saw it. It's a 100% shitty procedure that we don't agree with.

They're made from similar stuff to the ropes on scratching posts. Sometimes cats like to stretch and scratch in different positions. You can also get cardboard scratchers which have catnip inside to encourage useage.\n\nAnother idea is getting large catnip toys. Big enough to wrestle with and attack with their claws. Cats have a strong urge to hunt. Playtime with toys are fantastic to use to wear them out and they get to use their claws and muscles (wand toys are a favourite in my house).\n\nFinally, clean the wall where they scratch. Cat paws contain sweat and when they scratch, they're leaving their scent in that area. Clean it using scented antibacterial spray or very weak bleach. If the scent isn't there, they're less likely to go back to the same spot.\n\nI own 6 cats and a large dog. No scratching issues :)",

He survived nearly dying as a kitten due to lung infection, his berserk mode where he tried to take out other animal eyes, several surgeries, blocked kidneys, cancer, and still slowly putting along.\n\nEdit:: I have no idea how awards since I\u2019m still new using reddit, but thank you to everyone &lt;3",

    "postText": "I expect comments might say this is common knowledge. I will point out that a lot of people don't know about GMOs or science in general, including some of my own friends and family. This post is meant to address those people.\n\nThe only legitimate controversies over GMOs involve ethical or environmental concerns. One example is Belgian Blue, a breed of cattle that contains extra muscles. Critics say it is unethical to create that kind of cow. Note that the issue here is NOT human health. The cows themselves are perfectly safe to eat.\n\nI will repeat what I said in the title: GMOs have no established health risks in humans. In some cases, they are actually beneficial to humans. Consider golden rice, a modified version of rice that contains added precursors for vitamin A. This was meant to combat vitamin A deficiency in Asia, which can lead to blindness. The public\u2019s perception of GMOs prevented golden rice from succeeding, as was addressed in a letter from over 100 Nobel prize laureates (discussed [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/29/more-than-100-nobel-laureates-take-on-greenpeace-over-gmo-stance/)).\n\nGMOs do not cause cancer. They are created by inserting a non-naturally occurring gene or mutation into an organism which is then consumed by humans. While it is established that genetic modification can cause cancer, that would occur in the original organism, *not the consumer*. Genetic modifications are not passed between organisms. If you find yourself questioning that statement, consider the fact that genetic diseases are not transmissible.\n\nThere is an article from a Harvard blog that reinforces a lot of what I have said. [Check it out](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/will-gmos-hurt-my-body/) if you\u2019re interested, and I encourage you to do your own research as well.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of people address the bad business models (mainly Monsanto and overuse of pesticides). These are all valid complaints. I merely wanted to address the public illusion about the GMOs themselves.",

It's used on frozen food to prevent binding and to absorb extra moisture.  Used in salt and spices for the same reason.  But yeah, if fresh corn in a husk is labeled as gluten free, that's dumb",

As someone with Celiac, I\u2019m still sometimes surprised at how these companies sneak gluten into their food\n\nFor anyone looking to cook gluten free, look for a logo/seal that is is CERTIFIED Celiac safe gluten free. The FDA limit on gluten free is enough to trigger a reaction for some. Cross contamination can ruin a meal thought to be safe. For example, oats :( oats are not gluten, but there is so much contamination during processing",

In fact, many GM products are developed to require *fewer* pesticides.  For example, Bt corn includes a bacteria that acts as a natural insecticide.  Consequently, insecticide/ pesticide use is much lower with most GM crops compared with conventional crops.\n\nAs a general rule GM crops require fewer chemical inputs - insecticides, herbicides - compared to conventional crops.  Also, GM crops usually require less tilling and fewer fertilizers.  GM products are also commonly bred to be more resilient to shocks like floods or extreme heat.  And, on top of all that, their productivity is usually much higher than conventional crops.  No wonder [developing countries are leading the adoption of GM crops](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/06/developing-nations-lead-growth-gmo-crops/).",

Every single one of the brands in local stores is the same milk. Some are advertised as non-gmo, no-hormone, free range happy cows, and etc., and that's the exact same as Roundy's plain old milk. It literally all comes from the same cows.\n\nGiven regulations on this stuff, though, if the cows get sick and have to be given antibiotics that means they're taken off the dairy line and simply await being picked up to be turned into dog food. The \"grass fed cows\" for milk &amp; beef, well guess what: corn is a type of grass.",

The farmer will still administer the necessary drugs to preserve the animal\u2019s life. Like any drug however, antibiotics have a withdraw period. After that, animal products are free of it. However, they can no longer be sold as \u201cantibiotic free\u201d. \n\nMy favorite with milk is \u201cno rBST\u201d. rBST is a hormone that is naturally produced in cattle. Farmers found that by injecting their cows with it, they could increase milk production. Enough people complained about rBST in their milk, citing questionable data, so the US government banned its use. rBST is still present in milk though, since it is still produced by the cattle themselves. \n\nThat can be said for any hormone. If you ever see a label that reads \u201chormone free\u201d, it\u2019s a crock of shit. Hormones will be present in any animal product you consume since hormones are naturally produced in every animal.",

Despite being for an admirable cause, Supersize Me was full of methodology issues and the results have been widely criticized as being flawed and unreproducible.\n\n&gt; As Tom Naughton points out in his documentary, Fat Head, there's simply no way Spurlock could have been eating that much food if he was sticking to his own rules. A large Big Mac meal clocks in at \"just\" 1,450 calories, and it's by far one of the fattiest items on the menu. This means that even Supersizing lunch and dinner every day and adding dessert falls well short of the 5,000 calories a day Spurlock's nutritionist claims he was consuming. In an effort to find out just exactly what the hell, Naughton attempted to contact Spurlock to obtain his food log, but Spurlock (who makes a huge deal in his documentary about McDonald's never calling him back) never called him back.\n\n- https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2018/05/is-super-size-me-a-big-fat-lie/\n- https://www.cracked.com/article_20585_6-famous-documentaries-that-were-shockingly-full-crap.html\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccdfzq2M1Ec\n- https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me#Criticism",

While GMOs aren't inherently bad (and none to my knowledge cause negative health effects) the environmental consequences and economic/societal consequences are hairy issues.\n\nLike if a company were to genetically engineer a new type of plant, not just by breeding, but with gene editing technology, should they be able to own the rights to that gene sequence? Do we really want to apply copyright law to genetics? \n\nIf a company has a plant that's resistant to insects, it may lead to insects that are resistant to whatever chemical the plant is producing as an insecticide. Then we either have to use more insecticide, or we have to genetically engineer even more resistant plants. And what happens to the farmers that can't afford the special insecticide-enhanced seeds? What if the seeds blow into nearby crops (as seeds do), do they belong to the owner of the crop or the owner of the seed?\n\nThe \"it's not natural so it's not healthy\" crowd has their head up their ass, sure. But GMOs don't represent a miracle science that has no disadvantages. We need to tread carefully as a society.",

I couldn't find a single reputable primary source that GMO's were dangerous. Not one. I found plenty of *secondary* sources, and blogs, and so on. But I could not find *one* actual scientist who actually studies it that had *any* level of concern.\n\nSo I changed my view, because I don't particularly like disagreeing with facts and reality.\n\nMy position before had been that I didn't want to ban GMOs, I just thought they should be labeled.

Partly because there's no really good way to define GMO that wouldn't result in nearly ALL food getting labeled as GMO, and partly because it has been going on for a LOT longer than most people realize, and we would have seen any such effects already.",

While it is true that all crops have been selectively bred over decades to millennia, thus modifying their genes. It is only recently that we have had the ability to edit the genes in the organisms directly. This has been such an advancement, that there can no longer be an \"apples to apples\" comparison of the GMOS of today to those of the past, and to do so regarding safety based on the fact that both are \"GMO\", would also be ludicrous. \n\nWhile it is true that GMO technology can do pretty innocuous things like add a useful vitamin, increase yields, etc. GMOS of today also do things like carry insect gut-perforating endotoxins from bacteria. This would never happen with just selective breeding. The safety of Bt-corn is evaluated more like a drug trial or pesticide exposure study (because that's what it is, a natural pesticide that consumers would be exposed to in much larger amounts than typically otherwise)\n\nWhat's more, genes like these are so useful for the plant (absolute insect resistance to Lepidoptera), they tend to contaminate other non-GMO strains so they are essentially introduced permanently into the population of the crop unwittingly.\n\nBut again, that's just as safe as a selectively bred corn...right? Even though it hasn't been around as long as a human lifetime...right? \n\nThink about how many drugs, pesticides, etc. are determined to be 'safe' and then recalled. This kind of GMO warrants scrutiny and to say otherwise, I think is a mistake.\n\nTLDR;\nSome GMOs have a safety concerns akin to drugs and pesticides rather than food.  Scientists and informed consumers are actually concerned about THESE GMOS.",

This organism, also known as Bt, is commonly sprayed on lettuce, and is an [\"organic\" pesticide.](http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/organic_farming.html) The Cry proteins don't last long in an acidic gut; the pH and proteases of the mammalian digestive system make short order of them. Because the pesticide is produced endogenously (inside the plant), non-target organisms are generally unaffected.\n\nFrom that Wikipedia page, most of the other transgenic crops that are approved for use have herbicide resistance (much of this is coincidental with the production of transgenic crops- link herbicide resistance to, say, Bt Cry proteins, and screening is so much easier, and now it can be put in the field and sprayed with glyphosate).\n\nOther'n that and a handful of crops with improved pathogen resistance (most notably, having saved the Hawaiian papaya crop), most improvements are pretty mundane.",

Did you modify it to make pesticides or withstand huge amounts of pesticides? Less cool!\n\nThe point of resistant crops is to use ***less*** toxic pesticides post-emergence, or to replace the need for pesticides (Bt crops). Plants already produce pesticides. Caffeine, nicotine, limonene, etc.\n\n&gt; I just wanna know what the modification does.

When I was in high school, our ag teacher showed us an article on GMO corn. A company was doing some modifying on corn but it wasn\u2019t working. They were giving the corn to a farmer to feed his cattle so it wouldn\u2019t go to waste. The farmer realized that when feeding the cattle with this corn, the cows didn\u2019t have any diarrhea. Anyways, somehow, some people found out about this and had the idea to feed people in 3rd world countries with this corn. When they did, the people\u2019s dysentery went away just as with the cows.",

I tried to write essays in high school that said that GMOs were harmful to humans but there just isn\u2019t any evidence to support that argument. In fact, GMOs may be the only way to truly support the growing population of the Earth.\n\nTake corn for example. It isn\u2019t a GMO in the sense that people think of it. But over thousands of years we genetically modified the plant [teosinte](https://teosinte.wisc.edu/questions.html) through plant breeding to turn into what is now modern day corn. It isn\u2019t some awful thing that humans have created, but a tool that we can use to support the population more efficiently. \n\nThe whole non-GMO advertisement ploy is really a bunch of nonsense to sell more. Plus the lines are so blurred on what a GMO is that it doesn\u2019t even make sense to use it anymore. And anything that claims to be \u201cnon-GMO\u201d is likely not even true. I think we really need to get rid of the stigma around GMOs.",

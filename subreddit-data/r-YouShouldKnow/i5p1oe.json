Never expected this to get so big. Thank you for all the awards.  \n\nIt should be mentioned that any advice from any nurse or doctor should be taken with a grain of salt and with consideration of your relationship to that person.  It also depends on the setting you are in. \n\nA second opinion isn\u2019t a bad thing and often times doesn\u2019t mean the diagnosis is incorrect BUT sometimes there is more than one way to deal with things. (Treatment for cancer, surgical vs. medical management etc ).   Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to have two docs saying the same thing, especially when it comes to significant issues. \n\nI merely wanted to point out that because of the broken system sometimes things aren\u2019t as they seem.  Just know if you have reservations or concerns you have the right to address them.",

Had a dentist tell me I was going to need to have bone grafts done after my wisdom teeth were extracted.  I guess I should say he was a dentist/oral surgeon.  Anyway, I was internally freaking out because I couldn\u2019t afford that as it was not covered by insurance.  When he walked away for a minute the hygienist very discreetly, like literally under her breath, told me I was not required to have bone grafts, especially if I didn\u2019t plan on replacing my wisdom teeth with implants or whatever they\u2019re called.  Apparently it was just his M. O. to not only suggest that people always got the bone grafts done, but made it seem necessary no matter what the situation was after having any tooth extraction.  \n\nEnded up going to a specialist instead to have the wisdom teeth pulled.  That surgeon never even brought up the possibility of having a bone graft.",

I said 'great, I'm going to shop around a bit' since it seemed wildly overpriced and no one told me to do this, but I went to another place and they removed the ONE tooth that was hurting (and sideways) and then one other that showed complications. No graft. Nothing over the top. I paid for the laughing gas cuz FUCK that pain. $400 and I haven't had any issues since.",

Our dentist had a closer look at him and said no, they don't need to come out as long as they're kept clean.  Only had 2 of mine removed because they got F'ed up by cavities as a teen.",

I had three cysts, bursted one on the left, and scar tissue from another one on the right. They only checked because the nurse insisted on them giving me an ultrasound. The doctor told me the bigger one on my left tube, and the older scared one was what had been causing the extended/sexual pain. Sometimes doctors are a joke.",

She tested negative for COVID twice, been to the ER three times, blacked out and had a seizure-like episode last time she got her blood drawn, and keeps being told there\u2019s nothing wrong with her. I\u2019ve seen the blood work and other tests and there aren\u2019t any problems but there is definitely something wrong and they should be suggesting a course of action in pursuit of diagnosis.\n\nI had a serious illness that took 2 years and hundreds of tests and doctors visits in many departments to solve. I only had one asshole doctor and when I asked for a second opinion I ended up seeing the head of neurology because my case was so interesting and other doctors were advocating for me. Besides that one guy I was always taken seriously, though that was probably partially due to being able to understand the doctors, present my case well, and mostly communicate on their level.\n\nWith my gf, the majority of experiences so far have been negative and dismissive, treating her like she\u2019s young, dumb and everything is either nothing or \u201ccould just be anxiety.\u201d She\u2019s young but she\u2019s got an IQ of 136 and shouldn\u2019t be treated like that. I had to start going to every appointment with her and basically be her voice to get anything done. Even then, I\u2019ve had to argue a lot harder for the direction we want in finding a diagnosis.\n\nSo basically, fuck sexism in the American health care system and everywhere else for that matter. I\u2019m going to bring your no make-up suggestion to her and we\u2019ll see if it makes a difference, thanks for the advice.",

She has the fevers that wouldn\u2019t go away and even the seizure. She was tested for covid multiple times and her doctors told her to stay home and assume she was a false negative. She had also tested negative for several other things. Turns out that was not it. \nNow they know it started with some kind of infection that went unnoticed (maybe while she was in quarantine?) but anyway now she is being treated for C diff. \nIt has been just awful",

He is actually a family friend and I was about 20 years old. I told him I would get a second opinion and he said I was more than welcome to, but I would receive the same response from another dentist. Long story short I needed a mouth guard. I let him know and no longer go to his practice for my dental needs.\n\nA few years later I was diagnosed with cancer and referred to a doctor about an hour away that would have taken about 3 months to get into. I self-referred to Stanford instead, went in a week later, and found that I had precancerous cells, but no carcinoma. I called the doctor and let her know they had made a mistake in my diagnosis. She was very grateful for the information and called me a short time for information on my doctor so she could refer other patients.",

The same department also employed a famous doctor who had written a book we had read and appreciated and we were sorta disappointed we weren't seeing that specialist. We chatted with the nurse about the famous doctor a bit. We had to go to another room to see somebody else and the nurse told us to stay put for a moment and she would come back and show us where to go next.  She disappeared for a bit and then came back and walked us to where we needed to go. On the way we just happened to run in to famous doctor and the nurse said hi to him and introduced us. She then proceeded to give him a brief rundown of what our issue was and what had been recommended. He asked us some questions and then basically said no way no how would he every go through with that plan, that we probably didn't even actually have an issue that needed medical intervention at all. This turned out to be the case. I think we might have had an overwhelming amount of unnecessary medical intervention if it hasn't \"just happened\" to run in to that doctor.",

She also delayed my mom's knee surgery and brushed off my depression saying I need more time outside in fresh air and needed to exercise. \n\nI now see a male doctor that actually asks me at every visit about my mental state and if my medication and therapy are doing their job. He got me in to physical therapy about 2 weeks after I started seeing him. My back is better, my gait was off causing issues with my lower back on one side which can be common in people that have to learn to walk again. It's easy to favor one side without realizing. My depression is (mostly) under control, my anxiety is much better, I'm in therapy for my PTSD. He also got me in to an oral surgeon because I had neglected to go to the dentist out of fear and anxiety. He has helped me so much more than my previous female doctor.

Are you sure it's nowhere else? Over and over.\n\n\nI had wanted a biopsy done just on the slim chance it was actually fungal and no psoriasis, but he gave me the creeps so I just left with some steroid cream.\n\n\nI mean, he was a creep, but I highly doubt he would have done it to a male patient with psoriasis, nor do I imagine that the female doctors of that particular clinic (of which I had seen a few), would have been as insistent that I strip.\n\n\nPerhaps female doctors do, I mean statistically yes Im sure they abuse their positions.

I remember when I was young (around 13 years old) I used to like playing chess. I'm not particularly competitive and not even particularly good but I liked it so I decided to play in a local tournament. It wasn't anything fancy, no prizes, no qualifications for anything further, just a tournament between various schools if I remember correctly.  \n\nIt was played in this town hall kind of room, big open hall with rows of tables with chess boards and chess clocks (those little devices with buttons which time gives players fixed amount of time per game). It was mostly a fun experience but there is this one guy I actually wanted to throw headfirst through a window after our match.  \n\nSo I sit down against this guy and say hello etc and start game as normal. After a few turns not even that far into the game, I guess about 10 or so turns into it he just sits there not making any moves. He just sat there with the look that he was intently thinking about his move. There was no talking in the game so even though I thought what he was doing was weird I didn't comment on it, just let him do his thing. I may have said something after 10 mins or so of waiting to make sure he knew it was his go but it was long time ago, I can't remember.   \n\nAnyway, some time passes and then he just completely straight faced extends his hand to me for me to shake and says \"good game\". You see, I wasn't used to playing these tournaments with clocks. I had forgotten to push the button at the end of my last turn so I hadn't strictly ended me turn and my time was ticking down. He saw this and just sat there waiting for my time to run out and declared himself the victor when the time had run out. The sad thing was he was much better than me anyway and could have won by just playing it out, the guy was just a cunt to put it nicely.  \n\ntl;dr - guy sees I didn't end my turn properly so pretends he is thinking to waste my time for an automatic win",

My exam immediately shifts to \"was the old doctor correct or not\" and  creates a bias, especially if I have an opinion about the first doctor.\n\nInstead, have an exam as usual. If it's the same conclusion, great! If not, mention you've been told something else and see why there's a discrepency.\n\nLastly, trust the doc over the nurse. In all reality, you wont know the title of the assistants and it's more often a scribe or tech, not a nurse. The doctor is the only one mentioned with the training and knowledge of the literature to make the decision. When in doubt, get a second first opinion.",

He was from Africa, but I don\u2019t remember exactly where, I had a very high fever and it\u2019s all a little fuzzy. I remember he had beautiful skin, a deep voice with an accent that made everything sound better, and was extremely kind and attentive. I\u2019d been sick for weeks and had some giant, hot, infected lump on my leg. I\u2019d been to the doctor, I\u2019d been on antibiotics and steroids for 2 weeks. I wasn\u2019t getting better. The redness from the lump was circling around my leg, and I couldn\u2019t stand or walk on my own. My fever was 105. The ER doctor had given me antibiotics by IV and was about to let me go. The nurse came in to tell me and somehow I rallied all the strength I had left. I broke down crying and begged him to do something, told him I KNEW I\u2019d die if they didn\u2019t do something now. I didn\u2019t have long, please help me! He just nodded and walked out of my curtained area. I was so upset. I figured he was going to get my discharge papers and send me home to die. It wasn\u2019t much later that I heard him talking in an elevated tone. I couldn\u2019t make out everything, but I heard \u201cshe\u2019s extremely sick,\u201d and \u201ccertainty of or extreme fear of death are symptoms of sepsis!\u201d Right after the nurse came back and explained they were going to do a few more tests. They swabbed my wound and gave me more antibiotics, took some blood. Turns out I was having my first bout with mrsa and they believed it was starting to get into my blood. Different antibiotics, almost 24 hours in the ER curtained area, but I started to get better. I was well enough to go home on oral antibiotics because of that nurse. He listened to me when everyone else had overlooked me. I know he probably risked his job, but he saved my life.",

An hour later I was still struggling to breathe so I called 911. When the EMTs got there they took my vitals and told me that it was likely an asthma attack combined with a panic attack and asked if I wanted to go to the hospital still (pretty clearly they didn't think I should). I chose to still go because things didn't feel right. I ended up being hospitalized for pneumonia for a couple of days. I had a fever of 103 and my O2 saturation kept falling into the low 80s which is pretty bad. Pneumonia is extra dangerous for people like me with asthma and it could have been a big deal if I didn't go.\n\nBottom line, trust your body. I'm sure the EMTs thought they were doing the right thing in subtly suggesting I not go and spend the money for something that would pass on its own. But they aren't always right.",

Full-term baby, mother  is in the process of giving birth. Full staff, the whole nine yards.\n\nNo complications, completely healthy throughout the pregnancy. Not breached, no cord in the wrong place. Should have been a perfectly normal birth. \n\nBaby, is born dead. \n\nDoctors say it happens. Baby was dead prior to birth. The end. \n\nThe family is devastated. \n\nLeaving hospital. Nurse slips some forms, documents, and a statement under the woman\u2019s purse. \n\nCome to find out they didn\u2019t have a certified person reading vitals and administering drugs. Hospital killed the baby. \n\nDeath happens, but in this case it shouldn\u2019t have. The nurse went against so many things so that the parents would know. It\u2019s devastating, but thank you to that nurse who had strong morals and did what was right.",

While this sentiment may be true for you if you\u2019re a nurse, it is certainly not true of every nurse by any means.\n\nSimilarly I encourage my patients to get a second opinion if they are concerned, it\u2019s their right and I won\u2019t be offended. When it turns out I\u2019m right they are reassured, when I\u2019m wrong I have learned something. \n\nAnd yes nurse\u2019s do give doctors suggestions, because frankly they spend more time with patients. Icu nurse are at my hospital 2:1 patient nurse ratio and on the floor 4:1. The physicians on the other hand are often 20+:1 so we can\u2019t spend as much time with the patients so we utilize nurses for information all the time to make informed decisions, including whether the nurses suggestion is helpful or harmful or neither. \n\nJust like any profession, there a good ones and bad ones.

However, it\u2019s harmful to perpetuate the stereotype that doctors care more about medicine whereas nurses care more about people. In the US medical education system, after 8 years of combined undergraduate and graduate school, newly minted MD\u2019s/DO\u2019s spend anywhere from 3-7+ years in residency and fellowship working around 80 hours per week collecting salaries that often don\u2019t amount to much more than minimum wage when broken down by hour. Add to this that even most attending physicians find themselves working 50-65 hours per week, and you\u2019ll find anyone who runs the 11+ year-long marathon to becoming a physician for anything other than a deep commitment to patient care (e.g. money, status, or even knowledge) would be a truly miserable soul.",

Additionally, conditions develop over time and as more investigations might be done, further narrowing down the differentials or complicating a diagnosis. Add to that the fact that as a patient I know I certainly change the history I give as my condition changes or I notice different symptoms. \n\nA nurse saying 'Get a second opinion' is an easy thing to do, but should be taken with a grain of salt. Obviously the more opinions the better, but you also do not want to waste health system resources by 'doctor shopping'.",

I work at a big referral / teaching hospital, and I spend quite a bit of time explaining to patients that their previous doctor was not wrong or incompetent, it\u2019s just that diagnosis gets easier as more time passes and new information comes to light.\nBTW I\u2019ve spent time on rotations at smaller community hospitals, and in a pinch I helped out a smaller community hospital taking care of folks for a weekend, and let me tell you...that shit is HARD.",

I visited another doctor ASAP after extreme pain and she immediately did an exam and removed my IUD. She said anywhere between a couple hours or days, my IUD would have gone through my uterine wall and I would have needed emergency surgery. I\u2019m very grateful to the second doctor!",

One example was my father having an ongoing heart attack and the ER tried  sending him home. Thankfully my mother refused because of his pain and pressured them further. \n\nToday I have no problem question some doctos expertise/education if they are not helpful or talking bullshit. In hospitals I report them to their higher up's if necessary. 90% of them are taken by their pride and try harder and better.\n\nDon t ever be easy going about your/relatives health and doctors not helping you ! You have all to lose.\n\nAnd I'm located in Germany.",

The Nurse was confirming my insurance information before I was discharged. If this had happened while checking in, that would be scary as fuck. Sorry for the confusion.)\n\n\n\nThe third time I went into the ER thinking I was having a heart attack, I said to the nurse taking my information that I felt stupid for coming in because it was probably just a panic attack ( I had never understood what a real panic attack was until immediately prior to this). She looked me straight in the eyes and nodded her head while lifting her eyebrows. Like she was saying \"ding ding ding correct!\"  No way in hell the ER doctor was about to give me an opinion like that. The fact that she had to silently convey this to me is bullshit. But I am very thankful that she did, because I went to therapy and figured out medication.  My anxiety is now under control and I haven't had a full blown panic attack in two years.",

Sometimes, the nurse is just sick of your shit and wants you to find another clinic. \n\nI mean seriously, my nurses have begged me to discharge patients from my practice and I wouldn't put it past them to try to convince a patient they hate to seek care elsewhere.\n\nEdit: believe what you wanna believe.",

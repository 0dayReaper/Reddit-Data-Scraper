My library went fine-free a year ago and we send fewer overdue notices now than we did with a fines policy. (Not a lot fewer, but fewer.)

They eliminated fines and put up big voluntary donation boxes by the checkout desks and return bins. They ended up making more from those boxes than from the fines, and they got more books back in the end too. I think I\u2019ve heard some behavioral economists speculate that the patrons feeling social pressure and guilt for returning late books leads to donations that are more than what a fine would actually be. This location was in a wealthier suburb though.",

If I see a donation box at a library or nature preserve or wherever, I'll probably throw some change or a dollar in there just because it's in my pocket and I can spare it.\n\nA lot more people are driven by positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement. Books make me happy and I want to support the library, that's a better motivator than feeling bad about having books late. Which I don't really feel that bad about anyway because I don't generally check out anything with a wait list.\n\n(This isn't to say that I intentionally keep books past date. I'm just a trash fire of a human being with no organizational skills who gets stressed out by trying to decide what to *eat*. So sometimes it takes me a while to work up the energy to go to the library.)",

The non-librarians who govern library bylaws are usually persuaded when the community reaches out. I\u2019m a library grad student.Most of my professors and the working librarians I talk to don\u2019t really care about late fees, are more than likely going to wave them for any patron, and are trying to convince the administrators to get rid of late fees. Most of the time libraries don\u2019t include late fees in the budget so their not part of book buying or programs or anything useful since it\u2019s not a reliable stream of income. I know of a librarian who turned a portion of late fees into a pizza party for the children\u2019s library.",

Im sure if i talk to the librarians we can work something out but i have anxiety so ill probably just continue waiting till i can pay them. You can read a lot of books online and the library isnt even open right now so ill take care of it if i ever get my stimulus check.",

So we wouldn't get the book back AND our circulation counts would go down, which affected our funding.

After comparing my ID with the offender's, we both had the same first and last name, but different middle names. Hell, her location was even like 3 hours away from the library I was at. They still refused to let me check out more than one at a time even though they had a 15 book limit \"just in case.\" So yeah, libraries will absolutely nail you to the wall if they think you owe them money even if you're a totally different person.

Or when you\u2019re trying to keep all that free knowledge out of the hands of um, you know...certain groups of people.

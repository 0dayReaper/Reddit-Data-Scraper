    "postText": "Why YSK:\nThere is no U.S. federal law requiring employers to pay out unused paid time off (PTO). Some states have laws to pay out PTO, and for the states that don't have PTO laws, it can be dependent on company policy.  Some companies don't pay for unused PTO if you don't submit at least a 2 weeks notice, and some don't pay out PTO at all if you resign or are terminated.\n\nWhen I was laid off in 2020, my company didn't pay for my unused PTO. This fucking company also mandated 50 hr work weeks because I was salaried. They're out of business now, so good.\n\nJust recently, I forgot my state doesn't mandate PTO payouts, and when I put my 1 month notice in, I wrote how I planned on using my left over PTO at the end of my 1 month. Pay day came around, and I didn't get paid for my leftover PTO. I contacted HR about it, but I'm not optimistic I'll see that money.\n\nMostly YSK your state and company's laws/policies, and take your PTO before you resign or before your last day/week.\n\nEdit: Also YSK, from the comments, if you are exempt or non-exempt from overtime. Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay, and exempt employees are usually salaried and don't get paid when working past 40 hrs/week. Some salaried employees are non-exempt, so overtime is possible. From my experience, overtime usually has to be approved before you take it.",

I worked for Costco and when I gave my two weeks notice, my boss asked me what I wanted to do with my paid time off. I had no idea I got paid time off there. He said I can take it now and essentially quit two weeks early and still get paid. Or when I decide to leave I can take my two weeks break then and just not come back to work after. I've never had a boss so cool about this before.",

I asked the union and they said there's nothing they can do anymore since custodial isn't their union. So I spoke to the custodial union and they said there's nothing they can do because they didn't broker the deal. Had I known I would be moved to custodial I wouldn't have gone back at all. Even HR said that this was the most bizarre thing they've ever heard, but they can't go against union rules so I was SOL\n\nDon't get me wrong, I fully support unions and want to see them thrive in America as a whole again.

A lot of companies dish out all the annual PTO at one time for salaried employees, but they do that with the understanding that you will still work there to accrue the PTO for real. Many companies also don\u2019t allow you to take PTO during your notice period (maybe a day is reasonable but 3 out of 4 weeks, which you hadn\u2019t earned yet, is unreasonable). \n\nI took some PTO I hadn\u2019t accrued yet when I knew I was leaving a job. I told them before my last check was processed so they could take it out of my paycheck since I hadn\u2019t accrued the time. Did they? No. A few weeks after I left they FedExed me a letter saying I owed them back within 6 months or something. Out of spite I waited until the end of those 6 months because I had asked them to take it out of my last check and they just couldn\u2019t handle that kind of math.",

Usually the non emergency offices are closed, so you really can't work anyway.\n\nPrivate companies can decide based on their needs, what is their policy on public holidays.\n\nFor instance, most give the big ones Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years.\n\nBut if it's one day or two, or is it the Friday before the Saturday or the Monday after the weekend is up to the company.\n\nWhen you get to the second tier holidays, president day for instance, many companies don't give it.\n\nMany companies now also give a paid day off for volunteering or for giving back to the community, or for a day of learning about multicultural issues around MLK and Juneteenth.\n\nBut I know of no company, that accrues holiday days and if you decided to work on it, pays it out when you quit\n\nFor those who must work (emergency workers, or support personnel at multinational companies) it's not uncommon to pay overtime or to swap a day with other days later in the year.  But if you left before you use it, it lilely wouldn't be paid out unless it's in your contract.\n\nIt's really not confusing at all.  It's a question everyone should ask.  Most companies are very upfront about it, I've never experienced anything but a clear description of how PTO is given.\n\nThe issue really comes down to people not paying attention\n\nThe law is clear, it's consistent for all employees.

That is separate from \"public holidays\", which are the state or federal holidays in the US. \n\nSo the commenter you're replying to wasn't referring to public holidays. They meant that, in most of the western world, any unused vacation (aka holiday, PTO, FTO, annual leave or whatever else you want to call it) is required by law to be paid out if a person leaves their job or if they request it in lieu of time off. Where I live in NZ, we have a minimum of 4 weeks paid vacation days plus 12 paid public holidays and a minimum 10 paid sick days. These are part of the compensation, so vacation days are required to accrue and are counted as a debt. If a person accrues too much leave, the company can give notice requiring them to schedule leave or take a payout but it cannot be lost or taken away. Any casual employees with an irregular schedule that may not allow for vacation days are paid 8% above the advertised wage as payout for their inability to claim vacation. That is just the legal minimum though and many companies will offer better packages, especially with seniority. For example, I get additional \"company holidays\" over the Christmas and New Year break and got an extra week of vacation days after five years service. I'm originally American myself and the work-life balance in the US is one of several reasons why I would never consider moving back.",

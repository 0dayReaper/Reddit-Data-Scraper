    "postText": "Why YSK: I used to sweat in the arms regardless of the temperature which would create stains on my white/grey shirts. I tried everything from mixing up my antiperspirant brands to getting an actual prescription; nothing worked.\n\nOne day, I forgot to put on deo/antip after a shower and realized later on that I didn't sweat that day. I tried it again, same result.\n\nNow I use deodorant only, not antiperspirant, and I don't sweat. Turns out it was the antiperspirant causing the issue all along. (for me anyway; your results may vary).\n\n\nContext: I [just saw this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/12hmq56/ysk_when_applying_antiperspirantsdeodorants_allow/) and thought I'd add a similar YSK.",

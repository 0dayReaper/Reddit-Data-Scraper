    "postText": "YSK that US registered VZW devices are restricted in Canada. \n\nWhy YSK: Canada prioritizes their networks and puts VZW on the backburner. Be sure to plan out your networking before you cross the border to avoid headache.\n\nUpon purchasing my VZW Do More plan, complete with unlimited cellular data and 150GB of high speed hotspot data, I was told by the VZW representative that my plan would work normally in Canada. It was very important for it to work in Canada since i use my hotspot for work, and i work over video chat, so i use most of that allowance. \n\nWell, I made it to Canada for my 2 month long stay, and immediately realized that both of my devices were limited to 0.5GB per day. This was  virtually useless to me and you can imagine my frustration. I called Verizon and asked a completely different representative if I should have my full data allowance in canada; they said yes, it should work normally. I informed them of the restriction, and they seemed very surprised. I was on the phone with them for probably 2+ hours, speaking to multiple people. Eventually they gave up and said they couldn't help me.\n\nI also learned that I couldn't get a data plan that large on Tellus (or any other Canadian plan) since I was not a Canadian citizen. I eventually resorted to renting office space to get reliable wifi for work.\n\nKnow before you go!",

When I traveled for a year years ago I bought a cheap sim for a dollar and $10 would give me enough data for a month. \n\nI traveled to Egypt and Istanbul recently and used esim and it was coming out to roughly $8 per gig of data. I tried to conserve it but it was tough. Ended up just paying the $10 a day for Verizon and barely ran out. The 3g sucks but worst case I could pay another 10 and best case I still had SOME service.",

There are just some industries that seem to result in terrible companies. Everybody in Florida should have a solar powered hot water heater on their house; there is literally no physical reason why this is not the case. It just makes sense in every conceivable way. But because companies have decided to gamify the tax rebate system, the price of a solar hot water heater in Florida is inflated about 2000%.\n\nI feel like it's time we start stringing these guys up",

Her primary residence is the USA however. She has a house in Sweden. The Swedish gov't is so insane that they require a person number (equivalent to a SSN in the USA) to buy anything online, to pay for internet access, or to do many things. The hospital has to make a fake person number for me when I'm there to treat me. We have to rely on friends and relatives to do that for us, and then we pay them.

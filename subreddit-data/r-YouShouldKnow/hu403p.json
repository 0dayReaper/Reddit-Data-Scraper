It even has this tip on it that makes noise so people can hear it. I mean, it's a fucking white cane. Clearly, I didn't see whatever it was that I hit; and no, I am not going to be more careful. The cane is performing as intended. You have eyes and ears, pay attention for once. Grab the hand of the toddler running around. Get Granny's attention and show her what's going on since she left her hearing aids at home. It's really not hard. \n\nBut grab my cane and so help me God you better be ready to fight. I now know exactly where you are when you do that and you are going to see me very angry. If I need to defend myself you are close enough I can get it done right.",

You do not touch a chef's knife without explicitly asking first, unless you're best buddies who have worked together for years. I flinch and feel physically uncomfortable whenever someone even moves my knife, as if they'd grabbed my thigh or started stroking my back. If they're underneath me (an apprentice or bartender or whatever) I'll usually yell at them. If they're a boss, I usually say \"Please stop. Don't use my knife without permission. I'll get you a sharp knife or I'll do it for you. It makes me uncomfortable\". They never understand, but it's like a prosthetic or a piece of clothing, or like someone touching your hair pins or your jewelry.  \n\n\n\"Don't touch my dick, don't touch my knife\" is a common kitchen saying.   \n\nTo them, it's just a tool, but to you it's part of you, sometimes with a name like a child (Horsey, Killer, Sweetie, Flip-flop, Cannibal, and Sparkles are my main set), but always a personal part of you. I don't say goodnight to my clothing, but I say goodnight to my knives.   \n\nIf you don't regularly touch someone's child or penis, don't touch their knives or canes or wheelchairs.   \n\nEdit to add:  \nHorsey= a big curved scalloped edge knife.  \nKiller= a little Japanese style knife, bigger than a paring knife, smaller than a cook's.    \nSweetie= a gorgeous midsize cook's knife.\nFlip-flop= the most well balanced, spin-able knife I ever had. It's like a German style but rectangle, no tip).  \nCannibal= my filleting knife. Bastard regularly draws human blood when it's supposed to be trimming 100lb of ribeye or salmon.   \nSparkles= My darling paring knife.",

Because I left it there when I sat down.\n\nSecond, both rushing and emergencies happen, sometimes together.  If I need to move quickly, be it because my body decided that, oh yeah, I need to head to the restroom _right_ now, or because the fire alarm goes off, I'm going to be in a hurry. And I'm far better at remembering where _I_ put it than remembering where you did.  Even if I saw you do it and was paying attention.  And reaching for a support that's not actually there is a _really_ easy way to fall.\n\nAnd third...  Let's get to potential emergencies.  Like the power going out, or a fire that fills the room with smoke.  It's not just that you might need to move quickly, it's that I might not be able to see where you moved it.  And while _you're_ running for the door, I'm struggling to stand without falling over.  This doesn't make _anyone_ safer.  And combined with the last, I might not even know that you moved it.",

Depending on how long they are hooked up the same thing can happen with an \"extra\" appendage.\n\nFreaky thing is if it's left connected long enough and then remove, the person will feel as if they have lost the limb, akin to losing a limb they had since birth.\n\nI'm not sure if the pain sensation is the same, but it very much feels like they've lost an arm. Even psychologically distressed too\n\nEdit: I'm sure many hockey and lacrosse (amount others) will tell you that their stick \"is an extension of themselves\" , at least the good ones.",

I don't want to hear 'is this cane for fashion or like, a legit problem?\" or \"oh man did you hurt your leg, when do you heal?? \" or \"what's wrong with you?\" A wheelchair or a cane is just a tool like any other. It's not a big deal, but I also don't want to make it the center of attention. I find I get it worse because being young I don't 'look' like your stereotypical 'disabled person'.

Not saying people in wheelchairs can't be in bars at all, I believe all people are equal and deserve to be treated as such. I needed to kick him out though, he was over the limit and it was the law.... and I told my bouncer to kick him out and the bouncer promptly grabbed the handles of the wheelchair and pushed him to the door.... the look on this guys face broke my heart, he was crushed, he could have wheeled himself out with dignity instead of being pushed like a child, over the limit or not.\nSo yeah, this post.

It's heavy as fuck, I don't want you to hurt yourself\n\n2. It's expensive as fuck, and I don't want you to break something\n\n3. Replacement parts are expensive and due to corona shipping is slow AF\n\nDon't touch peoples things unless they accept your offering of help.",

According to BBB.org/ScamTracker reports, some websites that claim to check your gift card balance are really a way to steal money off your card. These sites ask for your card's ID number and PIN or security code. Then, scammers use the information to drain the money from your card. \n\nSource: \nhttps:/www.bbb.org/article/news-releases /14400-dont-qet-scammed-out-of-a-gift-card-this -season",

    "postText": "Why YSK: For years, I would spray cologne on my neck/chest/back every night after taking a shower, without realizing the harm it was causing. I used to suffer from persistent breakouts in these specific areas, and despite trying different skincare products, nothing seemed to work. However, I recently had an epiphany and decided to change my routine by only spraying my wrists with cologne. To my surprise, my skin has cleared up 100%!\n\nSources:\n\n[Neoderma](https://neoderma.com/blogs/love-beautiful-skincare/perfume-acne#:~:text=Quite%20often%2C%20perfumes%20created%20with,should%20avoid%20products%20with%20fragrances.)\n\n[AES Acne Clinic SF](https://www.aesacnetreatmentsf.com/blog/back-chest-acne-causes)",

Once, at an outdoor event, I washed my hands with scented soap, then stood for a while with the sun to my side.  The hand that was in full sun developed a minor rash, where I had used the soap, but the other hand was unaffected.",

So even if you know what you're sensitive to, you can't tell from labels whether it's in a product or not.\n\nI'm not sure why, but roller ball scented oils don't bother me like spray-on perfumes do (rashes, headaches, coughing). The one I currently use isn't even \"all natural\" (not that that matters, natural stuff can irritate as well, poison ivy is natural). Maybe the carrier oil protects my skin from the fragrance ingredients, and the fact that it's not a spray means it's not getting in my lungs when I spray it? Or maybe I just don't have a sensitivity to their particular ingredients?",

Direct application of essential oils to skin can cause burns. \n\nThe area of application still needs to be washed and moisturized at the end of the day/regularly because essential oils do have a drying effect on the skin. \n\nI find the oil/moisturizer a better combination than alcohol laden sprays.",

Once you start reading the ingredients it is Amazing how many of those sort of items actually use egg whites in them. Soaps Lotions several skincare products even makeups. We ended up having to use only completely natural products for her. Glad you figured out what was causing it but am allergy test might be the best solution cause everyone kept telling us it was probably milk since my family is full of milk allergies to our surprise it was the egg whites.\n\nAnother thing is if you use the same scent excessively over a period of time you can develop an allergy to it as well. This happened with my Mom who dearly loved the relaxing scent of lavender it was her go to and we had even used lavender scents in the wash cause it seemed to sooth her and she ended up being highly allergic too it.\n\nMy other daughter liked using the strawberry shampoos / hair car products she can eat strawberries but something in the dyes or scent caused her to be allergic too it after using it for awhile. \n\nMaybe try using a different scent or have an allergy test done you might be surprised to find out what the culprit actually is",

On top all I\u2019m about to say, I also have eczema! \n\nShampoo, conditioner, body wash, perfumes, lotions, bubble baths, laundry detergent, dryer sheets, even spray glitter. Absolutely everything gives me a terrible rash. I\u2019ve even been told I have a localized allergy to WATER, thankfully very mild. I also have a severe metal allergy. Pants buttons? Rash. Belts? Rash. Necklaces/earrings/rings/bracelets\u2026 everything. All I can handle is 24k Gold, which I don\u2019t even bother getting. \n\nEven Vaseline LITERALLY burned my skin away and when removing a small lump of it used to keep cotton in place on my forehead while professionally dying (was to stop color from getting on my forehead), it wiped away the top layers of my skin just as easy as it wiped away the Vaseline. Tried using Vaseline chapstick stuff years later, thinking maybe it was the dye that burned me, but the chapstick also burned me. \n\nAs an infant I was even allergic to 90% of diaper brands. Who even knows why or what they put in those things. \n\nI say this just as a heads up for anyone who didn\u2019t know you could be allergic to all this!! Especially those of you who have/are going to have a baby. I know people suggest Vaseline for babies. But I\u2019m begging you, PLEASE be careful. Don\u2019t buy people bath gift sets without knowing their allergies. (Receiving these was terrible. Could never use them.) Do not put a bunch of Vaseline on your child without doing a small spot check.",

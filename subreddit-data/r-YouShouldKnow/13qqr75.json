    "postText": "Why YSK: because LED \u201cIntegrated\u201c light fixtures (the fixtures without the standard bulb) have the light emitting diodes actually integrated into the fixture and are generally not replaceable. As a result, the entire light fixture has to be replaced after its useful life is reached.\n\nSome LED\u2019s have a life span of about 25,000 hours which seems like a lot of years. But when you break it down, it\u2019s only about 7 or 8 years when lit between dusk and dawn.\n\nI do like the way integrated LEDs look when they are illuminated and the ones I purchased have less glare, so if you\u2019re looking for a fixture that looks good when illuminated but don\u2019t intend to have lit very often, then get the one with the integrated LEDs. But if you plan on having it lit often, get one that accepts a standard bulb so all you have to do is replace the bulb every so often and not the entire light fixture.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m so nuts, I bought two back yard fixtures with integrated LEDs: one to install, and one for after it starts to show its wear. Will the technology improve by then? Undoubtedly, but I love it so much, I\u2019d hate to replace it with something else. I\u2019ve got a very old fixture in my front yard that I\u2019d pay insane money to replace for the identical one that\u2019s there! Are there similar ones available? Well, sorta, but they don\u2019t hit that exquisite spot in my heart.",

                    "comment": "That was a good idea to buy a spare fixture. When I moved into my 1960s house seven years ago, I replaced all of the exterior light fixtures with integrated LEDs. When the one fixture next to my garage door failed this year, I couldn\u2019t find the exact replacement to match the fixture on the other side of the garage door, so I took the same fixture from my front door area and moved it to the garage and bought a different fixture for the front door. But the new one by the front door I made sure accepts a standard bulb. I\u2019ll probably have to replace the other one by the garage door which means I\u2019ll have to buy two new fixtures so they\u2019ll match. Oh well, you live and you learn!",

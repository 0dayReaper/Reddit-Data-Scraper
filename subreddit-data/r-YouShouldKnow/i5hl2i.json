I was cooking dinner, coming off a long day of work, had a lot going on with my upcoming wedding, and my fianc\u00e9 was just getting home. Literally needed 15 minutes before talking, just to get a few things done and mentally prepare. I answered and asked him to call me back in 15.... still ended up rambling on and on for 20 minutes until I said I had a work call coming that I had to take (just to get him to stop, since I had tried interrupting like 5 times)",

She's super dramatic and very, very chatty and extroverted while I'm introverted on a pretty extreme level, socially anxious, and _probably_ autistic. I need at least a weeks notice to see someone- I do not handle someone just inviting themselves over, calling me in tears over every single boy-drama, coming over and chatting, then coming inside (quarantine restrictions haved relaxed in my country) and filling in my parents on the exact same info I've just sat through while I sit like a lemon because I've just completely run out of things to say about 2 hours ago. It's just so full-on, she doesn't seem to get that I NEED my space, and we don't even have that much in common. Plus, we actually work together, so I can't just never see her again, I just want to dial it back to maybe just being work-friends.\n\nSorry, it sounds like I'm shitting on your advice- it was very good and diplomatic wording, it's just that the situation's a bit different lol. Thanks for the advice though :)",

So, believing themselves ever righteous and correct, contacted everyone on my friends list to see what they thought of me so they could \"have an intervention\". I didnt approve or know this was happening until after the fact. \n\nBig shock for them, though: no one except them had any major problems with me, and the biggest \"complaint\" was from a coworker who said I was nice enough to her, but had heard other coworkers say I was an asshole sometimes, a character flaw I'm already well aware of. \n\nSo i ended a ten year friendship.",

I realized/remembered that friends are supposed to be  fun to be around, not an obligation, and certainly not something you dread because it's a coin flip whether they're going to stress you out even more after a day at work. Fuck that. Friends aren't supposed to be a second job. I shouldn't be expected to read into my own incredibly simple words to find niche crap that may or may not offend them. \n\nA friendship is a back-and-forth flow of communication and self-improvement, but any time that communication breaks down or becomes unhealthy (basically the same thing, in my experience) the friendship suffers and decays until theres nothing left but animosity and resentment over issues buried so deep neither of you even know why you're even mad in the first place.\n\nEdit to add: this whole thing was an argument over, not even a word I used, but the INFLECTION of my voice which they used to infer I believed something that I proceeded to state plainly that I didn't, then they went on to say I implied it, which I plainly shot down. They simply would not accept the fact they inferred it all on their own, therefore I was a shitty person because I was \"drowning them out\" because I wouldn't let them poison the well by saying that I implied the thing, and wouldn't accept criticism based on something they inferred. \n\nIf they had worded it as \"I felt like you were implying X\" that would have been a fine starting point, but they were starting on the basis that it was a FACT I'd implied the thing, so I wasn't letting that argument even get off the ground.",

I was rough, hadn't talked to anyone other than grocery store clerks. My state was bad, it was basically her or a suicide hotline. She helped a lot just listening and talking to me.\n\nIt's a few months later and we still talk, but through that time whenever I start to feel like I'm doing too much talking, I pivot the conversation and ask her questions about what she's going through. She's the type to just take on other people's stuff because she's kind, but afraid to be open to other people. If I probe a little bit, she'll open up and I can see that she's excited to share whether it is good or bad.\n\nI think that relationship is reciprocal, so I think it is pretty good. I don't really offload on her, we more share with each other and get through challenges at work together.\n\nMy best friend is a dude I served with in the Marines and whom I've visited in Okinawa twice in the last year. I really love him and his family. His wife once chewed me out once when they were on a trip to my city because my contact level was insufficient. It was great feedback, to know how much he appreciated our friendship and how much she loved her husband and was willing to aggressively share what he wasn't willing to in order to persuade me to adjust my behavior.\n\nThe thing is that every time we talk, I feel like I'm treating him as a dumping ground because he's the only friend I have that understands completely what I'm going through. I don't want to take advantage of him like that, and I don't want to drag him down when I'm in a dark place. I feel like I'm doing that whenever I call or text. But whenever I go for a visit, his kids are happy to see me and we're all on vacation mode. We spend the first night getting drunk and talking about our problems, then spend the rest of the week enjoying one another's company and enjoying seeing his kids happy.\n\nMy point is that I'm an old person at 36. I've learned to moderate my impulses to just dump on people after many years. If you're younger, please be more patient and more willing to share your perspective with your friends. Don't push them away just because you feel like you're being dumped on. They might not realize how you feel. Speak with them, share your perspective, and see if they adjust. We're all vulnerable, and we all need one another. Don't be so harsh.",

A large friend group that got smaller and smaller without me ever noticing. People got over their problems, moved on, started families, etc. Within the last 12 months my life absolutely fell apart and my mental health took a nose dive and has been spiraling.\n\nIt\u2019s just been a perfect storm of my life problems, mental health, a global pandemic, and realizing that the time I needed it for once, I look around and had no one to talk to or even seem to care enough to notice anything.\n\nThese Robin Williams quotes have really hit a spot and given me a much better appreciation of him.\n\n\u201cI used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It\u2019s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy. Because they know what it\u2019s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don\u2019t want anybody else to feel like that.\u201d",

I\u2019d usually talk with her every night when she got home from work and there was ALWAYS something bad that had happened.  I\u2019d get really excited when she got offered new opportunities and got to do cool things - but there was always something that would make the experience bad overall. There would be nights where I wouldn\u2019t come out of my room because I just didn\u2019t have the energy to hear what bad thing happened that day. \n\nWhen she got into a long term relationship I felt so relieved because my first thought was \u201cthank goodness, she now has someone who she\u2019ll turn to first before me\u201d. The fact that I felt that way was really telling.",

I worked 6 days a week at least 10 hours per day. On my days off I did laundry, cleaned, and cooked for the week. She also always asked me to RIDE with her to pick up her son or Dr. appointment. I learned very quickly RIDE with, meant DRIVE her with to or from or both. I loved her son. I would always make a game of our drives together while mom slept or weekend together where I would have to chase her down to get her to pick him up. So I always served him her favorite foods Lasagna from scratch and strawberry shortcake. Then tell him be sure to tell your mom what you had to eat. (Okay totally passive aggressive, but hey I was trying to make a point). One time she called all pissed off cause I had to work and couldn\u2019t go to her college graduation 3 hours each way from where I lived. She blessed me out then hung up! I hung up laughing. My husband said what are you laughing about. I said she will call back in the next hour cause she needs someone to watch her son. Which she did. I never made him aware of the situation. As I said I love that kid. His mother\u2019s behavior had nothing to do with his relationship with me. A few years later after he was in college she called again asking for something. I said, \u201ccould you ever call when you don\u2019t need something or call just to see how I am doing?\u201d She called a couple of weeks later to chat, then the next day for a favor. She wanted me to work 4 hours for her. I agreed. 8 hrs into me covering (I called, no answer) she waltzed in then got angry because I was mad. She yelled then physically charged at me. I walked out saying nothing until she charged at me. Then I let her have all of my grievances. She looked at me then asked \u201cAre you going to ruin our friendship over this?\u201d I said, \u201cNo you ruined it when you came at me! I am done.\u201d We check on each other on Facebook but no real contact since then. Her son got married, has a son too, I often send him greetings and best wishes. Still love that kid. Basically I am saying A person can only take so much before you end severely unbalanced friendships.",

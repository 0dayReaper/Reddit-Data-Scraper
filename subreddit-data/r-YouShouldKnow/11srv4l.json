    "postText": "Why YSK: if you expose your water-based appliance (e.g. dishwasher, washing machine) to freezing temperatures without proper preparation, the water remaining in it can expand and burst parts as it freezes.  So if you have to move such an appliance in freezing weather, or put it into long term storage, prepare it!\n\nI just was given a three month old washing machine that was left out in sub-zero (F) weather.  So far I've replaced the inlet valves and \"conveyor\" (the part that distributes water to dispensers for soap, bleach, etc.), and repaired two circulation pumps.  Remarkably, the drain pump survived.  I've done these repairs myself; having it done professionally might have cost more than the value of the machine.\n\nSo how should you prep an appliance?  I wish I could give you a solid answer, but I haven't been able to get any authoritative answer from any manufacturer or professional (I am definitely not an appliance professional).  I'll tell you what I did, and maybe we'll get some replies with better ideas.\n\nI just prepped a dishwasher for storage in a garage.  \nI used my wet/dry vac to suck all the water out of the interior.  Then I stuck the vac hose on the water inlet, and ran the machine through a rinse &amp; hold cycle, hoping I'd pull any water in the inlet side out.  I didn't see any evidence of water coming out; maybe it has all drained by gravity?  I hope so.\n\nI then stuck the vac hose on the drain line and repeated the rinse &amp; hold cycle, and pulled out maybe a cup of water.\n\nThen I poured a half gallon of purple windshield washer antifreeze fluid into the interior and ran the cycle once again, so that it would get circulated through the pump and tubing.  I had the vac sucking on the drain hose, and sucked out a bunch of purple fluid there.  \n(Thanks to someone in r/appliances for the antifreeze suggestion.)\n\nI'm calling it good.  I wish I had a better way to be sure there is no water left in the inlet pipes and valve.",

Not to mention it's built differently too.\n\nThat's like me saying \"man it sure is hard riding a bike uphill in the middle of the summer, it's killing my legs and I'm sweating crazy\" and the other person go \"haha I know right my convertible really burns through the fuel going uphill as I blast my music and turn up the AC to the max\".  Both are means of transportation, but not the same experience.\n\nIt's just not following the flow of the conversation and people who are would look at you like, \"who asked you?\"",

They are awesome for this sort of application and around where I'm at (midwest) you can pick them up at auctions, marketplace or garage sales pretty often. I don't think they make them new anymore but they were made for so long there are still tons of used ones out there. Most were made practically bullet proof which is why so many old ones still survive. They can be stored outside pretty easily, I think they were made to be stored outside and are gravity drained. Not only that they are just a cool part of history and just neat machines. My grandmother used one her entire life.",

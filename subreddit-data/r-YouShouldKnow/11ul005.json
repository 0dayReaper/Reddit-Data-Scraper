    "postText": "\nWhy YSK: There are videos going round at the moment of people picking up dolphins or dragging them by their tails back to sea after they\u2019ve stranded on a beach. Though well-meaning this is likely to harm the animal. Here\u2019s what British Divers Marine Life Rescue recommend:\n\nPLEASE look up a local rescue/marine mammal strandings organisation if you come across a stranded dolphin or whale. Pulling their tail can damage their spines, dragging on sand or rocks can injure their skin/internal organs, when on land their own body weight crushes their lungs so if you put them back out to sea they may just suffer more, and often when they strand something is wrong anyway. They need careful medical attention and trained people to help them.\n\nIn regard to seals, they\u2019re meant to be on land a lot of the time but can be sick or injured. If concerned, call the local group. Keep dogs far away and do not approach. A distance of 100+ metres away is advisable so they aren\u2019t stressed and don\u2019t rush into the sea.\n\nSome organisations include BDMLR for the UK, and the MMHSRP coordinates the national US mammal strandings response.\n\nIf you come across a dolphin or whale on land, here\u2019s how to help:\n\u2022 Call the local strandings group.\n\n\u2022 Keep noise to a minimum and dogs away.\n\n\u2022 If you can, very gently roll the animal onto its belly, making sure not to bend the pectoral fins upwards (put your hands on the back of your head, you can move your elbows forward but not back past your head. That\u2019s what their pectoral fins are like). Dig trenches under the pectoral fins so they can hang a little. If on their side, their body weight puts a lot of strain on one lung, crushing it.\n\n\u2022 Cover the animal with wet, light fabric like bedsheets to keep the skin from drying out. Do not cover the dorsal fin; cut a hole or drape the fabric around it. Wet seaweed works in a pinch. Keep the blowhole free of water, fabric and sand.\n\n\u2022 If you can, see if you can find out how long it\u2019s been there and if any attempts have been made already to refloat (put back in the sea) the animal. This is immensely helpful for medics to know as different sized animals can only survive on average for a certain length of time stranded. Any other info such as species, breathing rate, precise location (what3words is best!) and weather/tide conditions is also way more helpful than you may think.\n\n\u2022 Stay away from the tail. These are strong animals. Even trained medics have been killed by a whale\u2019s tail during rescues, and dolphins can injure/kill as well. Also, keep clear of the blowhole as this can expel diseases that are transmittable to humans when they breathe.\n\nFor more detailed info on helping stranded cetaceans, [BDMLR have a great how to help section](https://bdmlr.org.uk/what-to-do-if). It covers seals (not sea lions) and cetaceans in more detail and lists the U.K. hotlines you can call for help.",

If you ever think you\u2019ve been exposed, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask a medic for this if they carry one where you live, or ask for a point of contact to get the suitable treatment.",

They can have fairly serious problems and still be alert and rush to the sea. Even from afar the little white coat babies can be obvious on certain colours of terrain so some will see them from a distance and report them.",

Many will also be asleep for a time but if they wake up and you\u2019re close they may flee. Essentially it\u2019s to stop them being stressed, or potentially fleeing. Sure you\u2019d think if you\u2019re already close and they haven\u2019t fled then they\u2019re not going to ever, but these are unpredictable wild animals. They may not see an opportunity at first to flee when you\u2019re close, but if you step a little to the side they might make a break for it.",

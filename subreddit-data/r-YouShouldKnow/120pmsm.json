What about incentivizing quality training? Let's say massage place A comprehensively trains new employees for 6 months in order to maintain certain quality standards.  Now massage place B opens up next door, provides zero training, and offers slightly more money in an effort to poach place A's employees. If place A is not able to reasonably protect its investment in new employees, the incentive to do so goes away. Or the non-competes are simply replaced with training reimbursement agreements, as we are already seeing (imo with much more room for abuse than with the current system of non-competes).",

For now, I\u2019ll say the original thread got us off track from the get-go, as most training is *not* trade secret. Also, the trade secret deals I see tend to remove someone from an entire similar *industry* (rather than geographic location) cuz by x amt of time, the knowledge the employee has have will be less relevant (as company development progresses) and, well, forgotten by the employee compared to when they first left. \n\nOther initial thoughts: I generally don\u2019t want the poorest folks to have to change geography. Even an extra 10 miles, kills a bus commute, etc. \n\nI also have worked with enough companies personally and heard of so many more, that I truly don\u2019t trust the avg company. If they can\u2019t create loyalty with proper training, guidance, and at least reasonable pay, something is very wrong to begin with at that organization. I think that the capitalist way of \u201canyone can own a business\u201d turns into \u201cevery schmuck can use up people for their own interests\u201d and the\u2026well *better* [Conscious Capitalist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conscious-capitalism.asp) mindset is lost. \n\nI\u2019ll think on this more though. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nE: I should also mention that offering training is pretty standard is most fields. As is turnover. The key seems to be selecting individuals that give a better impression the there cut-n-run type folks.",

There is a much better middle ground than a total ban, for the benefit of entry- and mid-levels",

The absence of this clause may well dissuade the employer from hiring the employee, instead opting not to grow the business instead of take a risk of significant profit loss. From an employee standpoint, this means less opportunities to find work or break into a field. For the employer, there\u2019s the opportunity cost from lost business growth. For the customer, it means less diversity of services in the long run, as less workers are entering into the field. And for the specific economy it might mean growth stagnation. \n\nThe inherent challenge is the draconian evolution of unreasonable geographic restrictions (maybe as little as 2 miles and as large as 50 miles depending on the area of market capture for a business) which effectively make it impossible for an employee to remain in their home and work a new job within a reasonable commuting distance. \n\nI don\u2019t know enough about individual market economies to know how many types of services this argument applies to, but I doubt it is a majority. Whether any of these services are basic/critical, the only one I can think of off the top of my head is medical specialties. Regarding large corporate consequences, I can\u2019t even imagine..\n\nThe overall economy is nightmarishly complex, and making sweeping regulation such as this requires a VERY careful consideration of downstream effects, lest we reap the unintended consequences that our regulations have sown. \n\nSource: a guy who suffers from severe \u201canalysis paralysis.\u201d",

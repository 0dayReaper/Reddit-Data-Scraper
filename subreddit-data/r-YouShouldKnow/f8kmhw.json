Their popularisation and subsequent influence over modern-day culture is a great case study and window into the commercialisation of western spiritualism. \n\nWestern spiritualism that has become pretty much so non-existent and removed from modern culture that the only remnants of it are horoscopes and tarot cards. Which itself is pretty fascinating when you consider how integrated spiritualism is in most major Asian, Indian, African and Arabic cultures. The church did a very thorough job at removing it as much as possible from European culture.",

Classical Mechanics is very good science, and all *most* people need for *most* engineering purposes.  It's wrong in some circumstances.  But you rarely need things like relativistic corrections.\n\nLikewise, if relativity is proven \"wrong\", it will only be at some scales.  Relativity is already \"right\" at most, and very \"good science\" regardless of what comes next.\n\nBad science happens when the model you're using doesn't have any underlying relationship to the phenomenon you're trying to understand.\n\nThe bohr model is wrong, but useful, and has deeper physics to explain it.  Classical mechanics is wrong, but useful, and has deeper physics to explain it.\n\nThe lumniferous aether theory was wrong, and *useless*, it didn't provide any understanding for a mechanism underlying it.\n\nPhrenology was wrong and *useless* in the same way.\n\nThe standard model is almost certainly wrong.  But it will never be shown to be useless.  Same goes for relativity. \n\nWe don't throw entire scientific disciplines out when we learn our models need updating.",

GRE tutoring, AP classes, SAT, etc....\n\nYou don\u2019t factor in that they\u2019re traveling to you, paying taxes as an independent contractor, and they have to make an individual lesson plan tailored to one person.\n\nYou might think it\u2019s low because you don\u2019t have specialized knowledge anyone is willing to buy. \n\nA lot of the tutoring companies will require you to have perfect or near perfect test scores and then require you to take practice tests in the subjects you want to tutor. And besides all that, tutoring isn\u2019t easy. We\u2019ve all had bad teachers, so imagine 1-on-1 with someone whose entire job is to be a good teacher **just** for you. And she is in a PhD program.\n\nHell, I don\u2019t tutor because I have a full time job. But I have 2 masters from an Ivy. That alone would raise my rate to $150, and higher due to the subjects I would tutor in (real estate finance).",

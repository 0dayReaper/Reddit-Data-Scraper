    "postText": "WHY YSK: It's very understandable to have questions, but being someone's spouse or parent or child and being put on the spot during a funeral is often extremely uncomfortable.  Especially if you don't know the person you're asking particularly well, it can put them in a position of giving a meaningless scripted response, reliving unpleasant memories, or potentially having to lie to spare your feelings. A funeral is not the time someone in mourning needs to do any of those things in addition. Funerals are already stressful, and they dont need to be made worse. If you need to know, at least avoid grilling the spouse and any children who lived with the deceased.\n\n\nIt's perfectly valid to want to know how it happened (though most other people there can probably tell you the rough outline, without asking someone most heavily affected), but if you know the root cause, this is not the time to get details.  If you know they had terminal cancer, it isn't worth making someone explain that it was specifically heart failure, caused by the cancer, that killed them in the end.   If you know it was a car accident, it doesn't matter if they were drunk. If it was a violent death, ABSOLUTELY do not press for details and put someone in a position to give you a play by play.  Find that out before the funeral or later, if you need to know.\n\n\"What would they have wanted?\" is incredibly vague, and likely to give a canned response of wanting people to be well happy and carry on. If it was a sudden death or the relationship was strained, they may not know what the deceased would have wanted, and that can be an upsetting thought for them.  Consider if it was your family member who had died, how you would answer the question: the answer is likely similar.  \n\n\"How were they coping with knowing they were dying?\" I thought this one went without saying, but my mother's coworkers at a recent funeral have proved that wrong.  No matter what flowery language   you wrap it in about \"moving on to the next chapter\" or \"mourning themselves,\" that can be an extremely cruel question.  It's normal to be curious about that, but often the answer is not one you want to hear or one the person you're talking to wants to give.  Maybe they were at peace with it, and if that's the case, the family member may offer that information without being asked.  They may have had mixed feelings.  But they also may have been handling it incredibly poorly, and a lot of people would not be comfortable telling you at a funeral that the person was depressed or hopeless or even suicidal. Having to come up with a more acceptable answer than the truth is a miserable thing to do, and the funeral is not a great time to do it.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: If you eat a certain type of wild fig, there is a chance that a wasp has been inside of it. \n\nHave you ever noticed that fig trees don\u2019t flower? That\u2019s because a fig isn\u2019t (just) a fruit; it\u2019s a sphere of inward-facing flowers, or syconium. Its existence hinges on a complex, codependent relationship with a specific wasp species. The female wasp enters the fig through a small hole, the ostiole, laying eggs and simultaneously pollinating the fig\u2019s flowers. With a CT scanner, we can zero in on each stage in this fascinating example of symbiosis.\n\nThe female wasp\u2019s journey begins as it makes its way into an unripe fig through the ostiole, a tiny hole at the bottom \u2014 barely visible to the naked eye. It\u2019s a tight squeeze, and the wasp\u2019s wings and antennae get ripped off as it travels through the ostiole, trapping it inside the fig for the complex reproductive dance that follows.\n\nOnce inside, the wasp lays its eggs within some of the fig\u2019s flowers housed in the syconium, inadvertently pollinating other flowers in the process. The pollinator wasp dies soon after, and a powerful enzyme inside the fig digests its body.\n\nThe story comes full circle when the larvae hatch. Male wasps emerge first, fertilize the females that haven\u2019t hatched yet, and then bore tiny escape tunnels into the fig\u2019s wall. Having completed their task, they die. When the females hatch, they collect pollen from the now-mature flowers before escaping through their mates\u2019 tunnels. They then take flight to find a new fig and begin the process all over again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor more CT scans of plants and more: https://www.scanofthemonth.com/scans/geometries-of-nature",

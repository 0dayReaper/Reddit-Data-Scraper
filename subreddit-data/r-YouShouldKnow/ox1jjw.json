    "postText": "Why YSK: Dogs learn about their surroundings through their noses. What dog has been here? What is this interesting smell emanating from this green bin? Oh is that what snails smell like? There is a great misconception about walking dogs, that owners think the enriching part of the walk is the act of walking itself, when in fact its the sniffing your dog gets to do!\n\nYour dog gets the opportunity to think, learn, and satisfy an innate behaviour. Think of it this way, you get satisfaction by scrolling through reddit, but if someone made you sit too far away from the screen, and scrolled by things that appear to be potentially interesting, it wouldn't relax you, it would likely do the opposite!\n\nNext time you're out with your dog, try giving them ample sniffing time, you'll likely end up with a happy, calmer pup!",

ANYWAYS one day our grass sucker was broken so we had to dump all the mowers in one place leading to like a 3 foot high 12 foot long pile of grass, and my dog lost her mind. She just ran to the middle of it and froze. Like died and went to heaven. She later down and just started eating whatever she could find while rolling around in it. Most glorious day of her life\n\nEdit: https://imgur.com/a/mXQNdwt[here\u2019s a video of it](https://imgur.com/a/mXQNdwt)",

The dogs, as the saying goes, \"thought they'd died and gone to heaven!\"  They loved it so much.  Went from a small cement backyard to 15 acres.\n\nI did have to watch how I worded that to other people, though.  When the first person asked me how the dogs had adjusted to the move, I replied:  \"They died and went to heaven!\"\n\nThen, \"No no, they did not *die*!\"  They LOVE it and they are happy and healthy!  \ud83d\ude02  \n\nThey were also both strays/\"rescues\" so they were super-happy enough with my Dad.  The country was such another level for them and I'm glad they got to experience it.  \ud83d\udc15",

Like, they just keep walking and don't even pay attention to the dog, as if pulling the dogs collar which sits on their neck isn't even a big deal. But like, they're yanking on the dogs neck.. it really gets to me. Let them stop for a bit and sniff man. If they take bloody ages I'll gently tug a little bit and they'll quickly learn this means we need to move on.\n\nI think this edit is necessary:\n\nI am not advocating for the dog to lead your life. There's a middle ground. It's also situational. What I don't like is neglect or violence (like yanking the leash) which is abuse and.. illegal. If you're in a hurry sometimes, fair enough but I think you should also let the dog be a dog, let it sniff like OP says. Don't let it lead your life but let it be a dog. If you're ALWAYS in a hurry then do you really have time for a dog? Dogs need to exercise and if they don't exercise at home they need to exercise outdoors on their walks and this takes time. Neglect has a serious health impact on both pets and other humans. There's a good middle ground which varies from dog to dog and human to human and dog to human",

If they go good if not straight back inside an try again later until pup goes. Give lots of praise treats whatever and repeat until they have it down. Walks are a separate event and only YOU decide if a walk happens after potty. Dog works around YOUR schedule not the other way around.",

When we're on leisurely walks, I give him a lot of slack and he goes off and sniffs to his heart's content. When I'm in a hurry, it always seemed natural for me to gather the leash up and hold him close. In those cases, he stares straight ahead and charges on in whatever direction I'm walking.\n\nI didn't teach him to do it, he just figured it out on his own. He's a Belgian Malinois, so I'm pretty sure that has something to do with it. He loves when he feels like he has a job to do.",

Not all dogs are as compliant. \n\n\nWhen you see someone ignoring a dog's unprompted attempt to stop and sniff, they are practicing good training technique. I understand if you mean seeing people *yanking* the dog forcefully, that is never okay. But ignoring the sniff attempt is best practice for keeping a good heel, especially if the dog is even slightly hard-headed.\n\n\nIf you allow unwanted behaviors to occur repeatedly, *especially* things like allowing your dog to pull you wherever the hell they want to go, your training will collapse in on itself. I really feel like people need to stop listening to these \"pure positive reinforcement\" dog training \"gurus\" on YouTube. Most Aussies, Border Collies and other breeds are compliant enough by nature that you don't really need to correct them and PPR training works. For most people and most dogs though, this method is horseshit and not helpful in the slightest.",

He would get so excited and distracted he would yank on his own leash to lunge at strangers. If I wasn't careful I could go flying. He also would stop every 2 feet to \"smell\" but really he just would try to to piss on each spot.   Full positive training did nothing for problems we had. And Yanking does nothing harmful to a dog of that size, especially when one has a harness on and not a collar. He was a much happier dog when he was actually trained up and learned to follow.",

Do you do separate walks, like a short one for bathroom breaks and sniffing, then longer ones for physical activity and maintaining a heel, or is sniffing only allowed at someplace like a dog park?\n\nNot trying to push back, just have been considering getting a dog, and know training is a big part of having a good relationship with your dog.",

All training should be tweaked and tailored to fit you and your dogs' needs, there is no \"one method\" for training. The most important thing is to be consistent with your method. Inconsistency in training confuses the hell out of dogs and can quickly lead to anxiety and unwanted behaviors.\n\n\nI personally allow my dog to sniff if she has been maintaining a good heel for at least 5 minutes. If she tries to pull and veer off the path, especially consistently, I ignore it and keep walking. \n\n\n\nWhen she starts looking up at me and giving me her full attention I give her the \"free\" command, give full slack on the leash and allow her to sniff around for 30 seconds or so as a **reward** for being attentive. She has essentially learned to \"ask permission\" to sniff around by making eye contact as we're walking.\n\n\nIt works for us, she knows what she needs to be doing to earn her \"free\" time. \n\n\n\nEven now, after years of daily training, I still **always always** praise her when she looks at me while we're walking. Especially if there are other stimuli present.\n\nAs I said, every dog is different and will require different methods for obtaining compliance. You have to get to know your dog's temperament and tailor your training to it",

I have one specific area I take my dogs to go the bathroom so they now know that\u2019s their area to do their business and then go back inside. When I take them on walks I go to a different area, and I\u2019ll occasionally let them sniff for a little bit on the walk but once it hits like 10 seconds and they haven\u2019t lost interest I\u2019ll just gently tug on the leash and say \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d and they\u2019ll stop sniffing and keep walking. I also moderate how often I let them stop and sniff stuff. If I let them stop every time they caught a scent it would take an hour to go two blocks. But they\u2019ve seemed to pick up quickly that there are times they\u2019re allowed to stop and times they aren\u2019t, and I always praise them when they keep going past a scent when I ask them to. \n\nI\u2019ve found that consistency is key when it comes to training. Every dog is different, but every dog just wants to please. With gentle correction and a ton of praise when they do the right thing, they learn surprisingly fast. Best of luck if you decide to get a pup - they really will be your best friend for life :)",

Sure they're smelling, but they're also 100% looking for scraps and food to eat and their lack of discernment, wanting to be eating random shit outside can get very dangerous very quickly for the health of your animal.\n\nDoggo can and should be trained to not be sniffing everything on the ground and be trained to be following you when outside.

Each one of those sources said that walks need to be a time when your dog is focused on the pack, and is paying attentions to your leadership and communication first and foremost. At a time that you decide, you give the dog a cue to \u201cgo be a dog\u201d or whatever you say, and let her lead with her nose while you follow.\n\nYou\u2019re right that people should know that it\u2019s important for dogs to have time to sniff, but not that they should be allowed to do so at random times when you are leading a walk.",

Sometimes he even stops and sits just to smell the air and it\u2019s pretty cute.",

Longer lead and more freedom. \n\nIn walk mode, your dog should understand that you are leading and they are to stay by your side and continue along. In this mode, it\u2019s important to not let them lead by stopping as they please. Shorter lead and less freedom. \n\nBoth are important to practice regularly! Dogs like sniffing. They also like strong human leaders.",

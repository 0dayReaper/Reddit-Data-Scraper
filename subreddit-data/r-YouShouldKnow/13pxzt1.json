    "postText": "Why YSK: How many times have you tied something down, slapped it and said \"That's not going anywhere\", then got home and just cut the rope off because there was absolutely no chance of undoing the mess of knots you tied? Or the worse alternative; half way home you notice that your rope is flapping in the wind.\n\nA trucker's hitch is a type of hitch that is incredibly useful for tying down a load. The steps aren't terribly complicated, and you can practice them at home with just a short length of rope\n\nThis is my favorite instructional video on how to tie one of these fantastic hitches. I keep it in a YSK playlist for reference.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8dUP\\_xGa3g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8dUP_xGa3g)",

There are more reliable, safer, alternatives that are widely available, such as ratchet straps. These also require proper use. Before securing a load it's a good idea to do some basic reading on it. I've met a lot of people who have the cargo, and the trailer, and the ratchet straps, but they haven't a clue how the straps work and how they are best used, and how easily cargo can shift while driving.\n\nAnother note is that there are different kinds of rope out there, a lot of them will easily stretch or break. Knots will also reduce the breaking strength of ropes by 50% easily, depending on the rope and the knot.\n\nAll these things, and more, are left out in the video, and it should not be promoted as a way to 'tie down any load'. It looks like he uses a piece of clothes line in the video. The load should have been placed towards the front end of the trailer. It's a very bad example of securing a load.",

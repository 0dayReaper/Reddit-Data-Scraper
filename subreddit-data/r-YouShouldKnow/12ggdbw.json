    "postText": "Why YSK: If you are a parent with a child between 3-9, it is likely that you will encounter this type of \"new\" reading instruction. If you're in your 20s (like me) or older you probably had a different approach to reading. Many posts on other subs appear to demonstrate that few adults actually understand these teaching methods, and the comments are full of people trying to wrap their heads around what the terms on homework as early as Kindergarten even mean.\n\n**Overview:** Many educational institutions in the US have adopted a program called Fundations (also known as Just Words for older grades), which is a **phonics instruction model.** Phonics is the process of associating the sounds (phonemes) a letter makes with the written symbols (graphemes, or letters). Other phonics instruction models exist, but this is a very popular choice for school systems. Fundations is based on the Orton-Gillingham approach, which is a multisensory method of phonics instruction; when children are learning, they use touch, sound, and movement which is thought to aid in retention of the subject matter. It was developed to help children with dyslexia learn to read, but it is a valuable method for children with all learning differences and children who are neurotypical.\n\nPhonics is different from reading in that it does not purely focus on comprehension. Whereas one might expect a student to read a book about George Washington to learn about the first president, phonics is more concerned with children being able to identify the actual words within a sentence before they begin to understand what is being said. This is why many schools have time for \"phonics\" and time for \"reading,\" as although they are related, they are different skills.\n\n**Terms:**\n\n**Phonemes/Letter Sounds:** In the English language, there are 44 unique phonemes. These are individual units of speech that make up a word. Cat has 3 phonemes, /c/ /a/ /t/. [Here](https://www.readingrockets.org/sites/default/files/the-44-phonemes-of-english.pdf) is a list of every phoneme in English with examples. It is important to note that many adults believe consonant letter sounds end in \"uh\", like C makes \"cuh.\" This is not true however. [Here is a lengthy video demonstrating every phoneme visually and with audio.](https://youtu.be/wBuA589kfMg?t=73)\n\n**Tap Out:** Tapping out is when a student who already knows phonemes attempts to identify a word by saying the phonemes aloud, while connecting their index finger, middle finger, then ring finger to their thumb. This is the way Fundations asks to tap out a word, but there are other approaches. For example, in cat, the student would view the letters. They would say /c/, and \"tap\" their index to their thumb, /a/ with the middle + thumb, and /t/ with their ring finger + thumb, then finally \"blend the sounds\" to identify the word as cat. This is one of the \"multisensory\" elements of this model. Essentially, it helps students dissect words letter-by-letter rather than drawing from words they already know.\n\n**Letter Keyword Sound/Drilling the Deck:** This is part of the Orton-Gillingham lesson plan framework but it is also used in fundations. In Kindergarten, students learn 1-3 letters a week, starting with the most common phonemes. They learn a word that **contains that phoneme,** and the phoneme itself. For example, \"C\", \"Cat\" /c/. Children will then recite flashcards of these at the start of most phonics lessons. These flashcards are in a deck which children will \"drill\" at the beginning of a phonics lesson.\n\nThis is why so many people are confused by the keyword for \"x\" being \"Fox.\" The most common sound x makes is actually /ks/, even though at the beginning of a word it makes /z./ There are very few words in the English language that begin with x, so the special word contains the most common phoneme for x which appears at the end of the word.\n\nAs children age, they will begin to learn flashcards containing letter pairs that produce new sounds, as well as rule-breakers in the English language. For example, they might learn \"-ay\" \"Say\"  / e\u026a /\n\n[Here is an example of the POV of a student drilling the deck and practicing tapping out words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC7tLgcAidE)\n\n**Code:** Children may also learn to \"code\" words they have written, which is a bit more involved than I am able to describe here, but basically they are trained to identify special rules and draw specific symbols around the words they have written which have them. For example, if a child is \"coding\" a magic E word such as cake, they might draw a circle around the E and have an arrow from that circle pointing to the A to indicate that the vowel says its own name, /keik/. This is more sophisticated and not as commonly used by teachers although Fundations does include some of it.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nIn Kindergarten, children will begin by learning a few letters a week and practicing them. This will typically begin with consonants such as b, c and t. Although many children can quickly advance through this, Fundations has this go on for a few months. The children will learn the letter/keyword/sound, then recite them via flashcards and other visuals then write the letter in the air or on a textured surface (like sandpaper or shaving cream) or dry-erase, etc.\n\nAfterwards, children will begin with CVC words, which are consonant-vowel-consonant. In addition, children will also be exposed to high-frequency words that do not follow spelling rules (or do not follow spelling rules that they have not yet been taught); these are known as sight words or red words. Such as don't, can't, you, or was.\n\nCVC may include nonsense words such as \"luz\" or real words such as \"dog.\" The nonsense words are meant to help children with the baseline skills of decoding a word rather than identifying the word through memorization or context clues.\n\nEventually (in Kindergarten), children will begin writing short sentences that contain a mix of high-frequency words that they have been taught, and decodable words that they can tap out on their own. For example, a Kindergartner in the last semester should typically be able to write \"I ran to my home,\" because they have learned the words I, to and my, can decode \"ran\" and \"home\" because the student has learned the magic/silent E rule.\n\nChildren will learn to delete, replace or add phonemes to words through speech. Such as \"at. Say at. Now, add /c/ to the beginning. Cat.\" These exercises are often referred to as **phonological awareness exercises.**\n\nSoon children will learn r-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, or and ur), consonant blends (such as \"*tr*ee\"), digraphs (such as /sh/, /ch/, and /th/), syllabification (catnip, cat + nip, 2 syllables) and much more.\n\n**The overall goal of this model is to help teach reading to ALL children and to move away from the process of memorizing words** (because if they encounter a word in a reading passage that they do not know, they will not fully comprehend it)**. In essence, it helps children read words that they do not know quickly and effectively.** Children are not expected to \"tap out\" words for the rest of their lives; this is phased out rather quickly (by about 3rd grade) as it will become automatic.\n\nTL;DR: American children are being taught a way to read that many adults are not very familiar with and it is causing frustration at home. This is called phonics and the most simple way to describe it is teaching students the sound that letters make and using a bunch of different skills to help them identify words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Clarified coding\n\nEdit 2: The letter \"c\" actually makes /k/, not /c/, but I am doing my taxes now and therefore too lazy to edit the entire post.

Then decided teaching things by rote wasn't great for kids, so taught them to basically guess words and use pictures and the broader sentence to infer /guess words.\n\nTurns out, not a great way to read. The literacy rate suffered, particularly for those with learning difficulties. A generation of kids didn't learn how to sound out or spell new words. \n\nThis switch back to phonics is incredibly important, as study after study shows it works, for the most amount of people, and brings about the best overall outcomes.",

And each time, whole language has had worse outcomes. Like with dyslexia. Part of dyslexia is a lack of phonological awareness; and explicitly teaching the relationship between letters and sounds can help with dyslexia. \n\n\n\nAnd rates of dyslexia can depend on native language. Languages with a direct relation between sounds and the written language have lower incidences of dyslexia than others. Spanish, Italian and Finnish have lower rates than English, French, or Chinese.",

They also will not be able to spell.  Phonics rules are spelling rules.  This is more challenging in English than in other languages because we have more than twice as many spelling rules as most languages.  The average public school teaches the students about 12 of those rules.  *Twelve!*  That's why you are surrounded by people who can't read fluently, can't look up unfamiliar words because they can't remember what seems to them like a random string of letters, and who don't know enough morphology to realize that \"exacerbate,\" \"exasperate\" and \"exaggerate\" have different meanings, and who mispronounce things all the time.  I knew a 15-year-old who couldn't alphabetize yet -- tested IQ of 117 -- and another kid on my caseload, a high schooler, recently outed himself as not knowing yet that \"ph\" makes the same sound as an F.  I think our whole school system needs to be razed and rebuilt.",

You can think autocorrect for the correct spelling here. Still not getting it on my own. \n\nBest part about it is that none of my teachers could figure out why I couldn't spell when I was reading at least two books a day.

I was able to figure out words that stopped the other kids while they put their hands up and waited for the teacher to come and tell them what some word meant. My school district switched to phonics and it worked well then the whole word stuff became fashionable again and they switched back. This has repeated several times. \n\nI feel bad for the kids. They don't control how they are taught but not being a competent reader by fourth grade will negatively affect them the rest of their lives.",

We are having to teach her phonics and she is behind her classmates because it takes longer...\n\nThe reason is because my wife was a middle school teacher and most of the students couldn't read beyond a 3rd grade level. They were taught to only use sight words. 3rd grade reading level is when most books stop using pictures so they have no context clues, and can't sound out unfamiliar words. It's a difficult habit to break.\n\nSchools love it because they test well early on, but once a kid learns to rely on memorized words as their go to reading technique, they are pretty much screwed after 3rd grade. American education is fucked, these kids don't even have a chance in the future.",

And as parents we are chastised when our daughter does poorly on the sight word tests. Phonics is taught as an afterthought memorizing letter sounds and now at the end of the year they have moved to memorizing 2 letter blend sounds. No tactile learning methods other than maybe playing some phonics song and dance videos. We have been bypassing this completely and teaching her phonics exclusively from the beginning due to poor outcomes my wife witnessed first hand teaching 8th grade.",

This exist in other languages with latin roots, but english takes this to a whole new level. When I started HS in the  US I was surprised to see that if you present an American with a word they've never seen before, they can't pronounce it, or pronouncing it correctly amounts to guesswork. This is not so for say a Spanish or  French person. The sounds of Vowels and consonants mirror so consistently in every word you can  pronounce any new word with 99% accuracy.",

It is frustrating because even as an adult I mix up words that have similar shapes. \n\nFrom what I remember reading about it years ago, the consensus was that gradeschool kids can be retaught fairly easily if they originally learned to read from the sight-word method. They didn't seem to have the same hope for adults. Does anyone know if there has been any new research using phonics methods for older populations? Has anyone had success reteaching themselves how to read as an adult? \n\nIt would also be interesting to see if any eye tracking studies have been done comparing phonics readers to sight-word readers. I would think sight-word readers would have less consistency in jumping to from word to word and over/undershooting- it would be neat to see it quantified",

No, seriously, they were always giving me special privileges like that. When I was in third grade I had two workbooks with things like word and math puzzles for homework I guess because I already had mastered basic reading. I became pretty good at word searches that year. I also was given brand new library books that hadn't been put in the system in 8th grade because there were only two books technically in my reading level, and one of them was The Legend of Sleepy Hollow which is actually pretty short (there was a lot of emphasis on AR at that time).",

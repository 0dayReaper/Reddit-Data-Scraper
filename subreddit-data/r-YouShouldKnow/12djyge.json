To help with that here is a fairly comprehensive list of resources I put together that should help with most tax situations/questions.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off, the primary source for anything when it comes to taxes is going to come from [www.irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/). While articles from TurboTax, H&amp;R Block, or even the videos I'm posting down below are great and often are 100% true, it's important to know that whatever the IRS publishes is ultimately the bottom line.\n\nI've put together and produced all of the following videos to cover a variety of tax topics which should help the majority of people.

Turbo tax lures people in with their \u201cfree edition\u201d only to surprise you with the need to pay for the upgrade cause you have a tax form that you can\u2019t file for free. It\u2019s as close to a scam as you can get.  I think VOX did a big piece of intuit/TurboTax showing how they are just a huge pos corporate greed machine.",

It wasn\u2019t terribly confusing, but once my income became a bit complicated (like having a few freelance gigs), I was getting really frustrated with some of the process. Then I moved to work out of state, and that just made filing worse. I would be in tears sometimes and have to take extended breaks to calm down. Add to that the cost and the constant badgering to upgrade\u2026. I decided this year, after getting immediately frustrated after signing onto TurboTax, I would give FreeTaxUSA a try. I was wary at first\u2014how would it compare? But honestly, I\u2019ve never had a simpler or faster time with my taxes, even though not much has changed for me. I was done in less than an hour, and I was actually smiling at the end because it was so easy. It asked how I previously filed and gave me the option to upload a PDF of my 2021 taxes, and from there it was smooth sailing. And it was actually free federal and $14.99 for state! Didn\u2019t matter that I had 1099s (the form that forced me to pay $$$ to TurboTax because it\u2019s not \u201csimple\u201d). I might still be a bit awed by it to consider this an unbiased review, though; I did my taxes two weeks ago. I\u2019ll definitely use it again and hopefully will have a similar experience.",

TurboTax made it seem like my tax situation was complicated, so I was worried FreeTax might not have the infrastructure to handle it. Sounds like I\u2019ll be ok though. thank you!",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Inspired by the coins on a grave post, I wanted to add one that I was unaware of until adulthood. It is a common Jewish practice to leave stones/pebbles on top of grave markers, as a form of condolences or to participate in the burial mitzvah. The buildup of these stones can also represent the collective remembrance of the deceased. You shouldn\u2019t ever disturb a grave marker, but please, especially do not move these!",

People expect the food to be taken. \n\nI haven\u2019t been to a grave in the US so I don\u2019t know if East Asian people still use incense or not. But if not, you are free to take after a few hours or so. However, NEVER eat at the grave, it\u2019s hugely disrespectful, as much as taking the food early. \n\nSource: I went with my parents to our family grave every year when i was small and there were always little kids around. My parents gave them lucky money and told them not to take the food before the incense burns out.",

I've had my share of visiting my Gong Gong at Rose Hills (in California) and my Bubby at a Jewish cemetery. We've done the whole gansa megillah of leaving the food out for offering and lighting incense. I did not know we have to wait until the incense burns out.",

Because, in a sense, they are neighbors, and it would not be nice if you don\u2019t invite your neighbors when you have a party (the food). Quite intriguing now that i think  about it. And the whole thing about waiting for the incense is because you are inviting your ancestors down to earth to enjoy the food. Incense burns out means they went back to the other side. Not really religious, just a culture thing that everyone understands and follows.",

I was like OMG you guys this is going to happen??? I started getting into sci-fi and fantasy novels so this seemed amazing, like real-life futurism or something. I wanted to know everything and I just couldn\u2019t understand why no one seemed to care. It wasn\u2019t ever a topic of conversation, and while it\u2019s not like it was off limits, people didn\u2019t want to talk about it. It\u2019s similar to the way a lot of catholics react when you ask them if they believe they are actually eating the blood and body of Jesus. It\u2019s uncomfortable because they don\u2019t want to say they don\u2019t believe it, but they also try to desperately avoid saying they do. Does that make sense? I never got the sense that anyone I asked ever interpreted that stuff literally. \n\nActually, I got that impression about a LOT of topics, to be honest. People cherry-picked what they wanted to pay attention to. Ultimately I decided as a teen that I didn\u2019t believe any of it. While the culture is very important to me, I consider myself an atheist. I might be too cynical, but I think most people are, to some extent, pretending. Choosing to believe. Kind of like how Christians talk about faith as a choice. Jews don\u2019t have that narrative, but I feel like they behave that way.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll get off my heretical soapbox. I\u2019m not trying to offend anyone.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s only very tangentially related, but since I mentioned reading in the context of questioning religion, I think it\u2019s funny. In fourth grade our class had a boxed set of the Narnia books. Our teacher for our secular subjects wasn\u2019t Jewish and I think they might have belonged to her. So we were all reading them, swapping them around the class. I even did a book report on The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I had no idea Asian was an analogue for Jesus until I was an adult. Now I find the memory of the rabbi\u2019s son at his desk, in yarmulke and tzittzit, reading Christian fantasy propaganda to be pretty funny.",

Jews are encouraged to question and pontificate and theorize. While we use original texts (there is only one version of the Torah) there are many different versions of texts, basically like \u201cthe Torah according to [x person], where they include their commentary and interpretations. There are also a ton of things that are taken as fact, as \u201crules,\u201d if you will, but are actually just excepted practice (but often treated like rules. Like I said, complex and nuanced). \n\nAll that to say, I grew up ultra orthodox and never met a single person who interpreted that literally. When people \u201cstudy Torah\u201d they will pore over words and basically conduct literary analysis to the nth degree. This is different than asking someone on the street, \u201cdo you believe in resurrection?\u201d It sounds like it\u2019s like the Christian belief, and it is most definitely not. \n\nFinally, not being very familiar with Jews yourself, you may not understand where different groups fit into Judaism as a whole, and how they are viewed by the rest of American Jewery. So it may be easy to make sweeping generalizations that don\u2019t apply to many people outside of your specific experience.\n\nLet me try an analogy. Would you say Christians face a direction to pray, as Jews and Muslims do? If you said \u201cno,\u201d you would be wrong. Coptic Christians do. But, although technically correct that \u201csome Christians\u201d do, it would be misleading to say that because it makes it seem like a much more do. Most would say \u201cno\u201d with the understanding that there is a \u201c*\u201d to cover the rest.",

That was done in pure hate and disrespect, with no benefit to anyone. \n\nI'm just gonna say this tho, I oppose religious rights in society. Everyone should follow the same principles regardless of faith, but we have set specific rights and rules trying to please everyone. I'm not against having faith.

In India it's food, in Western cultures it's food &amp; flowers. The Egyptians offered cloth, perfume &amp; different exotic items.. But why the jews preferred stones over others..!! It could be an epithet but normal pebbles??",

It's to show the phases &amp; process of life.. With this small beautiful token of gesture we show that though life has got to end but it's still culminating &amp; beautiful.. Life goes on.. On the other hand the Jews prefer to offer stones only.. It's a gesture of gratitude &amp; signify that life has the end . . They also participate  in the burial of mitzvah &amp;  show that the departed soul belongs to stones.. \ud83d\ude42",

Now most Jewish people (outside of Israel) are buried in coffins instead of directly into the earth, so this is one way to follow the mitzvah (kind of like a commandment).",

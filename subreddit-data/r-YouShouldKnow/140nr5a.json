    "postText": "Why YSK: Driving conditions are extremely variable and factors like sun glare, tinted windows, your headlights are too bright, it being nighttime, or different ride heights can make it extremely difficult for other drivers or pedestrians to see inside your car.  If you are a driver who tries to wave people through an intersection you need to know that the intended target probably cannot see your gesture in perfect clarity.  If you are someone that looks for a wave from a driver you should know it can be super easy to mistake some innocuous hand gesture as a permissive wave.  \n\nNever cross a multi lane road because a driver stopped to wave you past--you cannot see through their vehicle and neither you nor the driver know the intentions of other drivers.  Don't be a victim of a \"wave of death.\"  \n\nBe predictable, not nice, and stop fucking waving for me to go ahead of you.\n\n(This happens to me almost every day; I wrote this up after having to stop too long at an intersection once again cause the fuck nugget with the right of way wouldn't go.  I could see only some small hand movements and a mirror reflection of the literal fucking sun off his windshield.  I have no idea if he was trying to be courteous or was just not paying attention and would end up running me over once I stepped into the crosswalk.)",

Trying to wave people through or trying to let people sneak across traffic out of a driveway or side steet only fucke up the flow and confuses people. Just do what you're supposed to do and it all goes so much more smoothly.\n \nThe other day, I was at a four way stop and it was my turn to go. I started making my way into the intersection, trying to turn left, but the guy on my right started waving the guy on my left through, even though it wasn't either of their turn. Guy on the left follows the instruction and just starts going through, almost hitting me. I stop, slap my horn real quick, and then start trying to move again when he's out of the way. Guy on the right then starts going and cuts in front of me. Again, stop, honk, try to go again. But the guy across from me starts driving straight through even though I'm in the middle of the intersection and starting to cross his lane while trying to turn left. Stop, honk, yell, finally get out of the intersection.\n \nJust fucking pay attention and go when it's your turn. Don't give up your right of way. Do what you're supposed to.",

Especially when visibility is low.\n\nDefinitely don't trust anyone that it's actually safe for you to go if you can't see. But if you can see that it's safe and the right of way is ambiguous (when 2 cars get to a 4 way at the same time the car on right has right of way, when 1 car gets there first they have right of way, so if you think they got there first and they think it was a tie you may end up in a stand off) AND they're telling you to go, then you can probably go instead of sitting there waiting for them because they're certainly not going.\n\nAnd as a pedestrian I'm never going in front of a moving car unless I'm certain it's far enough away that I will be done crossing the road before it hits me.   If someone comes to a full stop and waves to me and no one else is coming that's good enough for me.",

Pedestrians in the crosswalk always require you to stop, but if youre a pedestrian and you go to an intersection with traffic lights, you might have to wait for a pedestrian crossing light before entering the crosswalk (or otherwise cross at your own risk). In most places the driver is still at fault if they hit you, but in some places there's an exception to that where if it's physically impossible to stop it's not their fault. But regardless of whether the law is on my side, as a pedestrian I'm not going to trust my life to some guy who might be texting.",

Cars behind a car w right of way don't deserve that car yielding the right of way, and like you mention, one right of way driver yielding isn't ALL the right of way drivers yielding, which can result in accidents. I got in a 3-car crash due to jackass thinking that 2/3 of lanes stopping and yielding was sufficient for him to make a left turn. I was the 3rd lane, and had no intention of yielding, because my lane (right-hand turn lane) was clear, whereas their lanes were backed up behind a red light.",

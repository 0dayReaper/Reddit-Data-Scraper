And don't eat root vegetables because of a belief that they are alive in a different way than other plants are.  They're not vegan per se, but on balance I would say it is a more restrictive diet than veganism, and with similar focus on avoiding harm (and more restrictive than probably any other diet in the world with any significant number of followers or historical presence).",

The strict rules are only applicable to Jain ascetics/monks, who make up a very small percentage of the wider Jain community. \n\nMost Jains believe that they will all have a lifetime (since they believe in reincarnation) where they will have to live an ascetic lifestyle to gain ultimate salvation and be free from the cycle of death and rebirth, but most of them don\u2019t believe that they are called to do so in this particular lifetime. \n\nSource: Indian vegan here- it\u2019s not easy to find \u2018Jain\u2019 dishes which are devoid of dairy. I know from experience. And most restaurants here do have a vegetarian Jain menu devoid of onions and garlic, but there\u2019s  usually dairy in it.",

But each of them had dozens of clocks all over their walls, like every 20 feet.  And they weren't like decorative clocks, they were big digital clocks with red numbers, like at a sporting event.  Tons of them, everywhere.  Can anyone explain why? I've asked a bunch of Indian-Americans about that since then and nobody knows.  I've also googled to no avail.",

Also, please take off your shoes/sandals/footwear when entering the temple. Most of them have designated areas for your shoes right by the entrance but if not, just look for the area where you see a bunch of shoes. Socks are fine to keep on. Thank you!\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards, much appreciated! And whoever gave me the gold, you are the real MVP. But seriously, the awards are cool and stuff haha.\n\nHead coverings are provided by the Gurdwara, generally kept near the entrance or by where everyone puts their shoes. If you can't find it, just ask! Any kind of head covering works but must cover the entire head even if you are bald. Generally, I tell people caps/hats are okay but the traditional head covering or even a beanie works better as some people might see the hat as disrespectful.\n\nEdit2: Generally, Sikh men are supposed to wear turbans but those with cut hair wear the head covering as an act of respect towards the religion. Women can wear the head covering but traditionally are supposed to wear a veil/dupatta with the tradional Indian dress that every Sikh women wore back then. Wearing a head covering is a sign of respect towards the Guru Granth which is our holy scripture and the head covering is used to symbolize an act of obedience/respect, for lack of a better word, towards the religion.",

I know simply contacting the Gurdwara near me would answer this but if I may: is it considered acceptable generally to visit for the social aspect and also to try the food (I'm woefully underexposed to this cuisine) without necessarily being needy?",

            "comment": "Oh, oh, I have a story I want to share!\n\nWe have a Sikh temple in our town, and every year on the International day of peace, they hold an \"open house\" type of thing.  I dunno if all the temples do it, or just our local one, but I love to go.  The woman have an open closet type thing where you can go and they'll let you pick out an outfit and they cook a giant feast for the community and they'll have a cermony type thing where they invite different religions to put on a talent show type thing.  It's amazing, and I love going every year.\n\nAnyway, a couple years back, I went, and my youngest son was only a couple months old and was still being breastfed.  So partway through, he starts rooting around for a boob, and  I knew that they had a thing about your head being covered so I didn't didn't want to be disrespectful and whip out a boob to feed my son, but you know, he was a baby, and he needed to eat.  So, I went to ask if there was anywhere I could feed my son in private.  The gentleman I asked had a difficult time understanding me at first, and seemed confused, but then he was like \"ah!  The boy must eat!\" and he led me to the temple and ushered me in.  At first I thought he misunderstood, and explained again, I'm about to pull out a boob and feed my son, is that okay?  \"Yes, yes!\", he says, \"one moment!\" And as he backed away he pats his head and tells me \"remember, head covered always!\" He closes the door behind him, and there I am, alone in the temple with the prayers intoning around me.  I was super unsure, but, babies gotta eat, so I shrug to myself, and sit down to feed him. Just as I sit down, the door opens, and maybe 7 or 8 woman walk in.  They smile and nod at me delightedly, like I'm a long lost sister or something, and come over and sit down arrange themselves around me in a sorta comfy circle and smile happily at each other and me.  Everyone sits there nodding and smiling and occasionally reaching out to pet my son gently until he finishes eating.  Then they smile and pat me and wait for me to cover myself up and lead me back out the door.  When I step out the door, I see the original gentleman has been standing guard there.  He sees me, and gives me a huge smile, pets my son gently and says '\"yes yes, good boy, very strong!\" and then waves as he walks back to where he was helping at a table.\n\nIt is hands down, one of my favorite moments breastfeeding my son.\n\nEdit:. Omg, thanks for all the support and kinds words, you guys are awesome!  I woke up and my highest rated comment is now about me breastfeeding my son in a Sikh temple....I'm okay with this!\n\nJust to clarify a couple things, I had no issue with feeding my son, I just didn't want to be disrespectful, that's why I asked if there was somewhere I should go.  I wasn't sure if a culture that wanted me to keep my head covered was going to be okay with me pulling out my boob and I didn't want to cause any offense, especially seeing as they were being so kind as to open up their temple to the general public and feed us lunch and everything.  I was just trying to be respectful of whatever their level of comfort would be.  \n\nSecond, I do believe the woman were sent in my the gentleman in charge to keep me company and make sure I was comfortable, which was so so nice of him.  It was like I suddenly had a whole group of aunt's and grandma's protecting me and they were seriously so delighted everytime my son grunted and it was super cute. \n\nFinally, all you mama's telling me your stories, you're awesome!  And everyone wondering if you're doing okay, you're doing amazing!  I'm super pro babies being fed in general, and you're all beautiful mama's doing a great job!  Keep on keeping on, loving and feeding your babies!",

They are expected to volunteer to do a chore for the temple when they visit. If you are a regular at a Gurudwaras, it's expected that you will just pick up a chore without being told to. If you don't, or if you are well suited for a certain job, the temple elders don't hesitate volunteering you for a task.\n\nIn this case, the elder that you met probably just rounded up some of the female regulars.",

I was terrified on how to manage in India as we were going to visit my parents. \n\nSo I\u2019m sitting in the airport terminal after landing my kid was hungry and having a tantrum and I\u2019m running around trying to find a private place and I see a woman just feeding her daughter as she browsed on the phone. \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized breastfeeding isn\u2019t sexual. It\u2019s the best thing for the baby (as I had supply). So I sat in a place little less crowded and fed him. No one even gave me a second glance. \n\nI was in one of the most famous temples, and same thing happens, he\u2019s screaming as it\u2019s hot, crowded and wants to be fed. There were literally 100s of people, so I\u2019m hesitant. All the men move away from me, a bunch of women form sort of circle around me and I sit down and feed him. He fell asleep once he fed. \n\nBreastfeeding isn\u2019t supposed to be sexual.",

It's ok in the Netherlands, but when your baby is about 6 months old people start to get fussy if you still breast feed. Just across the border in Germany it's very much normal to breastfeed children for several years. \nI hope to breast feed for at least a year, so I'm already geading up to angrily glance at anyone making comments. The last decade I've seen less and less women whip out a boob to feed their children, it seems to be 90% bottles.",

As a customary practics, they also leave a banana leaf near it to indicate that there's food in the house and never to hesitate to ask the house inhabitants. A lot of weary travellers come in stay and literally become families. My great grandmother has told me stories about how her father walked 120 kilometres in 4 days with nothing but a water bottle and an extra set of cloths. He'd have stayed in many houses happily and recieved the gift of humanity.\n\nEDIT: Spelling and another famous phrase used all-over out country- 'Athiti devo bava' roughly translating to treat guests just the way we treat our god's.",

I was assured by the people I was with that this was a hookah bar, but I honestly don't know if they were fucking with me or not, but it was a sureal experience.  The owner spoke very little english, but spoke more German, which was something I at least kind of knew.  So we spent hours smoking, getting drunk and me and the owner making jokes at each other in broken German.  That's not something I'm ever going to forget.",

We were all shocked since volunteering in the US usually requires advanced sign-up, training, etc. But no, we could just sit down and make bread with them, with zero training or background or anything.

It meant that anyone, irrespective of their financial or social background, would sit together to share a meal. A big lesson in humility. \n\nWhile it's not compulsory but you can express your gratitude by donating money or by even helping them out in the activities like cooking, cleaning or serving. When you see so much unconditional love among strangers, it's hard not to feel the gratitude. So yes, everyone can go there and eat as much as they want! And don't be surprised if you see people doing their bit without even been asked to.",

Not just with the meals, but with the opportunity to feel useful, even if just for a few hours and on a small scale.\n\nI try to give to them when I have the opportunity. They really do live by their beliefs.",

My roommate was Sikh and suggested that we could stay at the Temple for a night or two while the exterminators did their job.  We not only got a place to sleep for the night, but they also cooked up some good Indian food for us.\n\nGenerally I've found that people of all religions as long as you show them respect while in their house.  When I was in Italy and our car broke down in some middle of nowhere town, the village priest allowed the three of us Yanks to stay at the church.  Since there wasn't a mechanic in the town and it was a Saturday, we ended up staying the rest of the weekend and part of Monday.  We were treated pretty well and even ate in people's homes for free (we tried to pay them but they refused payment).",

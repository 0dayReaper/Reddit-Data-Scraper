If there\u2019s no plexiglass barrier between you and the employee(s), you should wear a face covering out of respect.\n\nFor the people who don\u2019t believe in the recent events, this post isn\u2019t aimed towards you, you guys won\u2019t wear one regardless where you are. This is for people who have truly cared about other people\u2019s well-being and have been wearing a face covering in public spaces. \n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this to a few of my friends who wear face coverings in public, and they haven\u2019t realized that going through drive thrus is essentially the same thing as standing next to the person. Ever since I brought it up to them, they started wearing one when they go through drive thrus.",

The headsets ding when a car arrives, and if we don't answer it, it keeps dining. The mics are sensitive, we usually have them turned up, so please no honking or yelling. Related, if you insist on ordering from the passenger seat, SPEAK UP. WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. Don't mumble, don't speak through your window half rolled up, don't turn your head away from the speaker from ordering. If you've been waiting for a hot minute, have your payment ready! You know you're gonna have to pay, don't just sit there ducking around and get to the window and go \"oh! My wallet!\" and spend another minute looking for it. Try to park close to the window, a lot of us are short and can't reach when you're parked 5 feet away, and nobody likes hanging out of the drive-thru window. Try to keep your order short and sweet, we are evaluated based on our drive-thru times. If you won't do it for us, do it for the people behind you. If you are cold having your window open for the few minutes you're there, think of how cold we are with the window open for hours; the whole store is freezing",

I feel like a lot of Trumpers survived the last four years by laying low. They just can't hold back anymore for some reason over the election. Remember who they are and absolutely consider voting for Trump a personality red flag.\n\n&gt;\n\nMy ex was in the Miss Maine pageant in 2018 and 2019. Donald trump is known to have watched 14-17 year old girls in the changing rooms at his own pageants. She confronted him as to how he could vote for someone who did that when she literally could have been a victim of a person like that, and he says \"it's not about personality, it's about policy!\"\n\n&gt;\n\nThey can't tell who toxic people are and that means they're vulnerable to being influenced by toxic people. It's safest to stay away from them until they figure it out.",

He isn't hiding shit; he thinks being a fascist is something to be proud of.\n\nWomen like my mom and sis seem to be the ones hiding it around here, from what I've seen, at least. The women who voted for Biden are pretty vocal about it (hat tip to my gals!), but the quiet ladies who think \"it isn't polite to talk politics\"\u2026well, talk to them long enough, and something will slip about vaccines or immigrants or crime, and you know.\n\nHonestly, I think that's worse than the open fascism. My dad doesn't think he's doing anything wrong, even though his views are abhorrent. My sister and mom clearly know they're wrong on this, and they don't want to be called on their bigotry and hate.",

So, being verbally assaulted in a drive thru wasn't great, but he did drop his credit card out his window right after that and had to awkwardly get out next to the building and window to get it. He had some 2nd grade looking hand written message about the dangers of masks on his back window that I didn't notice right away. What a winner. I can't imagine genuinely caring so much about another person's actions. He sounded genuinely distraught and pissed that I was wearing a mask. I was a bit on edge because I thought he may actually get out of his car to approach mine. People are nuts!",

The air system inside your vehicle, the air system inside the restaurant, and the open air surrounding both. All the systems have varying pressures. Likely, the pressures inside the car and the building will be higher unless it's a windy day. That is if you have the fan running in your car blowing warm or cool air, this will be the case. \n\nAir movement will be restricted from a low pressure system to a high pressure system. This means that the air outside will have a hard time moving inside, resulting in less airflow between persons than than two standing next to each other while in the same system of air. Bear in mind, also, that not all systems are the same. Sharing a space outside is vastly different from sharing a space inside. The air outside is moving a lot faster and farther than the air inside. Transmission rates outside are at least an order of magnitude lower than inside.\n\nAlso consider that time is a major factor in transmission. Most if the time, transmission occurs between individuals who have shared at least 15 minutes if breathing the same air. And when I say transmission, I mean that a person becomes infected from another infected person, and not just that infected droplets were transmitted between persons.\n\nTaking all of this into account, I would estimate the rate of transmission at a drive through to be at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than rates of transmission inside a gas station, which are already relatively low.",

I wont be mad if you're quiet, I know you're deciding without you making noises that I'm forced to listen to.\n\nIf there is a large line, please prepare your payment and clear your cupholders ahead of time. I have another customer in my ear whos ordering/waiting to order. I'll be nice as can be, but all I'm thinking in my head is \"This guy was in the line for 4 minutes and thought that when he arrived at the window THAT would be the best time to fumble through his bag to find his wallet and figure out where to put all the garbage he's been saving up in his cupholders.\" No, I can't take your empty Monster can and throw it away for you, its a health code violation.\n\nPlease do not dump your day old coffee out on the concrete in front of my window.\n\nIf you seem genuinely apologetic about doing any of these things I will be an angel to you. It's the people in their own little world where nothing exists beyond themselves that get to me, which is surprisingly few people actually.\n\nI actually love answering questions about the menu.

A mask doesn't protect you from what other people are dishing out (even n95 doesn't very well). Only a respirator can protect you from inhalation.  Second, buildings like fast food places are slightly pressurized, they have to be because vent hoods and those kinds of things suck out huge amounts of air when running, and a/c or heating with it.  They have whats called make-up air to replace it, and it keeps the climate control equipment from being overworked and maintains comfort for the staff and guests. It also prevents exhaust from the cars in the drive thru, and sewer gasses from the plumbing from being pulled into the building. This in effect causes anything coming from the small window at the drive thru to be scattered the moment it leaves the window (partial pressure).  Third, the exposure time at a drive thru is minimal.  Most businesses try to limit time for a car to sit there to less than a minute, the more cars you get through the more money they make.  Even then, the time face to face with an employee is a tiny fraction of that time.  They aren't standing there half out the window the whole time.\nI'm all for safety and public health, but I'm also realistic about these things as well.  Its akin to wearing a mask alone in your car while driving.\n\nSource: HVACR tech specializing in building pressurization, outdoor air and IAQ.",

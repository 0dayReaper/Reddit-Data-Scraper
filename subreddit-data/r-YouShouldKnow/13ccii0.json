    "postText": "**Why YSK:** Oftentimes we\u2019re completely oblivious that the things we say or the way we say them can produce an oppositional response in other people. If we want to communicate effectively, to persuade someone or to even get our message heard, it pays to keep in mind that individuals have a need for autonomy \u2013 to feel like they\u2019re doing things their way. So if someone feels like you\u2019re imposing your own view on them, they might (consciously or not) resist it. \n\nOne way to avoid psychological reactance is to invite people to share their perspective - e.g. a simple \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d can often be enough to create a sense of collaboration, yet it\u2019s so easy to miss and drone on about what \\*we\\* want and think. \n\nAnother way is to present options, rather than orders: e.g. \u201cyou can think about X if you want to do Y.\u201d And finally, a good way to preface conversations is to say \u201cthese are just my thoughts; feel free to ignore them if they\u2019re not useful to you\u201d.",

He would stand on the side of the shopping cart then step off then back on.  So I said, \u201c you can stand on the cart or walk, but you cannot do both, it\u2019s a safety issue.  You choose.\u201d  So he stayed on the cart with no problem.  The best way to deal with controlling adults is like OP said, ask them what they think.  It helps them feel they have some control.",

They'll literally fake it and then they make it because the habbit is formed.\n\nBut I don't have any kids so probably don't listen to me, good luck!  \n\n\nedit: Oh and don't bother looking for that particular childrens story it's dutch and I can't even find it in dutch so it's probably some weird passed down/wrongly memorized version of something.",

Instead of asking \"do you want to put on your shoes?\" you should ask \"do you want to put on the left shoe first or the right one?\". That way they feel like they're in control but it doesn't really matter what they choose. If you give them the option to say no they might take it just to feel in control.",

Instead of asking if she would like to help pick up her things, a better approach was, \u201cit\u2019s time to pick up your things, would you like to start in the living room or playroom?\u201d  This gave her no wiggle room to say no.  To her child mind, only two options existed, and it was important to her that she got to decide. And there are lots of options you can come up with: do prefer to do it now or after your snack?  You can also make it a competition.  My two girls were slow to finish their yogurt drinks before school in the mornings.  So I turned it into a race.  \u201cOn your mark, get set, go!\u201d  Then I would look at my watch and tell them who was fastest.  And say, \u201calright let\u2019s see who the winner is tomorrow!\u201d  We did this for years and they never caught on!",

Think about every time you've walked into a store and the sales associate says \"can I help you find something today?\" and you always say \"No, just looking.\" \n\nSo how do you use this basic human reaction to your advantage?  Ask people questions where a \"no\" response to your question is what you're looking for.\nExample: You need to talk to someone and you know they're busy. Don't say \"hey do you have a minute?\" or \"is now a good time?\" The gut reaction is \"no... I'm really busy\u201cor something to that effect. Try instead \"hey did I catch you at a bad time?\" When they react with \"no\" they're brain must justify that decision and they will usually follow up with \"no, I have a second\" or \"no, what's up?\" Even if they are busy.  Bonus, they feel like you respected their personal situation.\n\nSource: studied Neuro Linguistic Programming for my sales career and put these technique to work on the job and had the desired results.  Dozens of times a day, on the phone, \"Hey Pat it's Terry from XYZ Corp... Did I catch you at a bad time?\" 95% of the answered calls said, \"No, I've got a minute.\"\n\nAny reason you couldn't try this simple example on someone?\n\n(See what I did there?)",

Some retail stores train their floor staff to even take that a step further and ask a completely unrelated question like \"how's the weather outside?\" so that the customer doesn't have their resistance up right as they're walking in the door.

If so, I'm guessing it's about how i use respect and autonomy to get my kid to do his work. \n\nWell, he always come home with school work he didn't finish AND homework. So there's always a balance we need to figure out between what i need to do and what he needs to do for the few hours were together between my work schedule and bedtime. \n\nHe's a gamer, and I know from being a gamer also that sometimes there are things do to in games which are scheduled events. So i usually make sure he can do his work before or after that so it does not interrupt doing what he loves most. \n\nWe also both have adhd so i understand the need to stop and do something else sometimes since executive dysfunction is real and i remember feeling physical pain from being made to sit at the table and do my homework. \n\nIf he is behind on work, i try to figure out how many assignments there are and how long they will take roughly and we both agree on a timeline to finish it all to where it's either split up evenly, or split up in a way that might give him a day off (for example, if he had plans with his friends or girlfriend over the weekend). \n\nHe is a teenager so i do get some resistance from time to time, but when that happens, i try to bring him back down to earth and remind him that I'm giving him a lot of freedom to decide things that most parents or teachers would not and in exchange, all i ask is the same level of respect when i need help with things too. And that's usually enough to get him to cooperate. If not, i start taking away the freedom to decide for himself little by little but i also give him the chance to respect my wishes immediately in turn for my respect back immediately. So it's seriously never really more than maybe an hour of defiance i might get from him. Then we are a team again.",

I will usually dictate how many are done each day or how often things need to be cleaned. And of course, there are things he will need to clean whether he wants to or not (like his room). \n\nSo i might say \"the bathroom needs to be tidied up every day and deep cleaned once a week and the tub once a month\" i will have him agree that it's only fair to clean up his own bathroom since it's his own mess, let him pick the day he wants to deep clean and which day he wants to do the tub. \n\nLet's say there's a day he's sick or just doesn't feel like tidying up. I will \"make a deal\" (this is a very common thing we do). I tell him that i will tidy up for him that day (so he knows it can't just be skipped), but in return he has to tidy my bathroom on a day I'm sick/or don't feel like doing it. We write these things down and sign it like a contract to remind us both that we agreed this was ok with us. And it's a good sort of way to not only reinforce keeping promises but also allows autonomy in a way that is also an obligation to someone other than themselves. \n\nAgain, if he ever refuses to follow agreements he helped make, i start taking away the freedom to choose and he hates that so much that he will start cooperating immediately just to get his freedom back",

We will have this discussion until we have come to an agreement we're BOTH ok with. \n\nSo if he doesn't want to clean my bathroom in exchange for me cleaning his, then he will have to pick another chore. If he suggests taking out the garbage instead, i might tell him that it takes more effort to clean his bathroom so he'll need to pick something else or add another easy one... Like maybe taking out the trash for 3 days. \n\nYou know, i just mostly tell people to talk to your kids the way you would talk to a friend or coworker. As adults, we are \"always\" (i use this term loosely) allowed to choose for ourselves. And we would never yell at, punish, or force other adults to do things they don't want to do when they don't want to do them. It builds resentment no matter what age you are. \n\nThere is still room for authority being the adult. If my kid is like \"i tidy up the bathroom every daaayyyyyuuuhh. It's already cleeeeennnnuh. It's a waste of my time to do it again today.\" I try to remind him that i have over 30 years of cleaning experience and he only has 8 and that I'm trying to teach him the right way to do it so he is ready to take care of himself when he moves out. That he will be really embarrassed when his girlfriend comes to his place and there's whatever all over the toilet seat and the sink is nasty... And how can you expect to have clean hands when you're using a dirty sink. \n\nAnyway, i will give him speeches like that, give him the chance to just go in and get it clean in 5 minutes and be done with it or i can keep lecturing him on the importance of cleaning for 15 minutes... And which would he rather do?... And in doing that I'm giving him autonomy again, but it's something I'm ok with and since he will pick one or the other it's also something he's ok with. That's what i call the illusion of choice lol.",

Don\u2019t say \u201cIsn\u2019t it great we fixed that homework problem you were having?\u201d. Instead try \u201cWow I\u2019m so proud of how well you\u2019re doing with your homework, I\u2019ve noticed how much time and work you\u2019ve put in and I\u2019m very impressed. Want to show me what things you\u2019re working on now?\u201d\n\nThe thing is that this takes time. And energy. And patience. When you\u2019re tired and busy, sitting down and going through homework sounds awful. And when they\u2019re not getting a concept after an hour of you explaining it you get frustrated and just want to give up! Everything from your body language to your tone of voice to whether your distracted by your phone all could inadvertently send the message to the child of \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here doing this. This is work. This feels like punishment. I hate that you\u2019re making me be here because you\u2019re bad at doing homework.\u201d The child will pick up on that vibe, they will internalize it. And then they too will feel like this is work, punishment, and that they\u2019re annoying you and making you upset because of their personal failures.\n\nI don\u2019t blame parents who can\u2019t get this right, because it\u2019s frickin hard. It\u2019s really frickin hard. And it takes so much time, and so much energy, and so much patience. And no one is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes every once in a while. And then you\u2019re in the tough position where you have to apologize to the child and say \u201cI want you to know that I love spending time with you, and yesterday I didn\u2019t show that and I\u2019m really sorry if I made you feel like you upset me. I know you\u2019re doing your best every day and I see it and I\u2019m really proud of all the progress you\u2019ve made. I was tired and had a rough day, but that\u2019s not an excuse for taking it out on you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I\u2019m going to try my best to be better because you\u2019re so important to me and I love you so much and I want to be better for you.\u201d\n\nYou know how hard that is to say to your kid? For many people, extremely. They weren\u2019t raised that way. They\u2019re not used to hearing anyone talk that way. They have no practice talking that way to adults let alone children. It doesn\u2019t come naturally to them. \n\nParenting is hard.\n\nAnd while my above advice may be helpful for MANY children, **every child is unique** and what works with one child may not work with another. I am by no means claiming to be a perfect parent, and I absolutely don\u2019t want to claim that my advice always applies in every case. I just hope it helps with some people in some cases maybe.",

I find myself telling friends and family A LOT they're kids, they're still learning, they need help until they can master it themselves. \n\nUnfortunately for my kid, it's not just homework, it's also 90% of his school work. And it's not just recent, he's been this way literally since kindergarten. \n\nHe is special needs. So he's had the benefit of an IEP and lots of other \"teachers\" (counselors, occupational therapists, aides, etc) to guide him to success based on his needs... They all give up on him. He is currently in a private school specifically for ASD students and there is no success with work completion there either. \n\nHe's in 11th grade now and to this day, I'm literally the only one to get him to do his work. We do all school work and homework in about 3 hours. But you're right. The main reason i think i can get him to do it while no one else can is because i will sit there with him the entire time. I make sure he understands things, or reword things out give analogies so he might have a better chance of understanding. I make sure he stays focused, give him breaks when he needs them, remind him it's ok to guess if he doesn't know the answer (because he's a perfectionist), and that's it's also ok to half ass things sometimes (because writing an entire essay is like pulling teeth and i do understand that anything is better than nothing lol... We're not all built to be writers!).",

As a female I've learned to mask it all very well. \n\nSo icr to a lot of how my kid feels and thinks.

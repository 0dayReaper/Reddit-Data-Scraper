    "postText": "Why YSK: Different states have different deadlines for exchanging drivers licenses and registering cars. \n\nAfter the exhaustion of a big move, the trip to the DMV can drop down the priority list of things to do. If you wait until the last minute, you may find that you don\u2019t have the documents you need to exchange your license (especially for a new federal REAL ID). And with time running out, you may have to order original copies of birth certificates, SS cards, and even marriage licenses that may take weeks to get mailed to you. \n\nChecking the requirements for these actions on the DMV website for the state you\u2019re moving to beforehand and making sure you have or order those documents before you move can save you a load of stress and multiple trips to the DMV along with avoiding any possible fines and tickets.",

I know many cops saw me as I worked down the street from the police department.",

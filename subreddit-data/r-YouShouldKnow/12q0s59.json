    "postText": "Why YSK: They gather bacteria like everything else. Think about it, when was the last time you washed your animals food receptacle? I\u2019m assuming 90% of you will say and realize that you never have. I\u2019ve noticed Cats mainly will have a slightly renewed appetite after the bowls been washed. Dogs are less picky but you wouldn\u2019t eat food off a plate that\u2019s been re used a couple hundred times without a wash. Don\u2019t make your animals do that. Same goes with everything else they use and interact with.  I\u2019m tired of seeing friends and family that have pets with crusty food bowls, animal beds with their hair as cover as thick as a blanket, etc. Part of loving your pet is cleaning up after them and for them. Nuff said.\n\nEdit: Happy to see my 90% is off the mark, at least according to this thread.",

When we adopted our current pair from the shelter, I did notice they had a fountain in the cat room. They mostly ignored the bowl of water, but one of the cats came running whenever I turned on the sink., drinking from the stream. After a few nights of leaving the sink on at a low stream, we went and picked up a fountain. They drink out of the fountain but the one who always came running still likes it when I turn the water on to wash my hands but she doesn't drink it anymore.\n\n  \n\n\nI do wash all of the feeding plates and fountain bc as a kid I remember how disgusting the pet bowls got.

They also fed both dogs out of the same bowl (huge no no) which was also never cleaned. \n\nThe dogs were also in poor health, the girl dog in particular had a horrible ear and skin infection that just never went away and the boy dog experienced frequent eye and moderate incontinence issues.\n\nI had to beg them to take her to the vet and when they finally did no one wanted to give her her medicine regularly like the vet ordered and the infection came back.\n\nSome people really should not have and do not deserve animals.",

That is so disgusting!!! \n\n(Edit: I clearly misunderstood - dogs were *sharing* same bowl, not same bowl being used for food and water. However, that's still bad.)\n\nI know a family like this. They've had many, many pets over the years because they looove animals. They just....don't like caring for them. I've tried dropping hints. I've tried cajoling the kids (\"How would *you* feel if you didn't have water / had to eat out of the same dirty bowl every day / had to use a smelly  poo and pee filled bathroom / your parents didn't give you your medicine.\") I can't interfere any more because I've already caused some arguments/dramas between them and have been told in no uncertain terms to MYOB. \n\nThe most I can do is love, love, love on those pets and try to sneak them fresh water in a clean bowl when I'm there. \n\nWith my own mother I once had to kidnap her dog, who had an ear infection with lots of pus, and take it to a random vet. My mom refused to take it in because she \"had company\" (me and my siblings). \n\nI know I'm not the greatest pet mom in the world (I do not play with / exercise my cats as much as they deserve), but they have clean everything and good grooming and lots of loving and regular vet care. I'd starve myself or sell off something before or offer to clean cages before I'd let them suffer.",

Has a very pleasant mild herbal smell that doesn't linger very long.\n\nI would suggest lint brushing the blankets first, then spraying them with that, and then washing them, see if that cuts down on any odor transfer.  I'll see if I can find the stuff...\n\nIt's called Sol-U-Gard Botanical Disinfectant.  It can be used like Windex but I use it more like Febreeze.  I love the smell, just smells grassy and clean, and I've never had it damage anything and I've sprayed nearly every soft surface in my house.  Definitely helps eliminate pet odors and the like.  I even spray it in my boots before I put them on the boot dryer.",

He had some kidney issues and I'm pretty certain that not cleaning his dishes regularly caused it because of the biofilm that develops. Even if the biofilm wasn't the cause, it certainly hindered his ability to heal.",

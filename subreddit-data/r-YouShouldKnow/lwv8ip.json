The local carriers are by far the best, but don't have the infrastructure.  The big guys just nickel and dime for everything because their time is limited.  None of them have innovated since their inception.\n\n**Verizon** still has the most outages (and the biggest) yet still don't have Fiber to Home everywhere, despite the billions in subsidies.\n\n**Cox** still has the worst routing and blames your modem 99.99% of the time and it magically gets fixed 2 days later (probably when the original route comes back).\n\n**Comcast** has the best support, but even then that's all you really get. They charge for data usage which is generally a made up fee outside of peak hours - which can still be argued in my opinion.\n\n**Google Fiber** paved the way for retail but they have no business options.  If you want to run your house as a business your fee increases 6-fold and all you get is a static IP - which is also bullshit considering they're IPv6 based (this is my opinion, they can do better).  What you don't get is an SLA meaning you can go down at any time with no compensation.  $75 becomes $600 and all you get is a *single static public address.*  Great for retail users though!  I heard recently they're upping the game and in some places they're putting out Metro Wireless which should be good, but wired will always be better than wireless.\n\n**Spectrum** is basically just Comcast rebranded with worse support.  For example, they will blind call you to pay your bill and request your CC info over the phone by voice anywhere you are, but when you ask for an emailed receipt they won't do it, they force you to their online portal (which also sucks).\n\n**ATT** is the absolute worst and will nickel and dime you and backbone you on DSL.  Their fiber is literally from your house to the road and then it's bullshit from there.  The issue is that ATT owns the most retail infrastructure and everyone else has to rent it from them.\n\n**Starlink** seems good, but it's wireless and I cringe at the thought of any wireless provider.  Up front costs are huge - $500 for the equipment, then $99/mo for (roughly) 100Mbps, but your latency is not good and will cause issues regardless of your throughput.  Their saving grace will be (A) you can take it with you and (B) if they can follow through on getting latency sub 25 ms  by summer, this will be huge.  I think the target was 50 ms IIRC which is still good, but latency is a bigger killer than throughput most of the time.\n\nThere's a reason why a lot of the backbone providers got ate up by these shitty retail providers, it's the \"economies of scale\".  Now the backbone providers are getting worse and worse and in some cases they're rebranding.\n\nIf I missed a provider, let me know.  I'm not shy to share the issues among any of these fucks for constantly making my job a living hell.",

It rose over the years to 2 then 3 dollars.\n\nThen, years later, someone started crunching the numbers, and it turned out that the tolls couldn't even pay for the interest on the loan, and the debt was just getting bigger.\n\n\nSo what did they do?\n \nTHEY SOLD THE  BRIDGE TO A PRIVATE COMPANY!!!\n\nThe company hiked the price to $4 and has been there ever since. When the governor ordered all north bound lanes to stop collecting tolls during a hurricane evacuation, the company even kept count of all the vehicles it let through, then claimed something like $10 million in \"payments not received\" on their taxes.\n\nI don't understand how any of that was/is legal, but its happening.",

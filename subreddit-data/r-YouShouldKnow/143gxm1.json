    "postText": "This only applies in the United States. Please feel free to add information about other countries\n\nI want to make it clear first and foremost if the dog is not causing an issue, don\u2019t say anything. That is illegal and could result in very hefty fines. Follow all laws and regulations in regards to the ADA.\n\nThere are two questions you are legally allowed to ask the owner of a service animal about their dog:\n\n1. Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?\n\n2. What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?\n\nThat\u2019s it. Don\u2019t ask anything else. If they cannot answer these questions or refuse to answer you can deny them entry under the ADA. You cannot ask the customer any questions about their disability or really just anything aside from those two specific questions.\n\nNext I would to make it clear that service dogs are not required to wear a vest identifying them as such. The owners are also not required to provide proof or even carry documents regarding the service dog.\n\n\nHOWEVER, there are instances where you can kick the dog out. \n\n\u201cThe handler is responsible for the care and supervision of his or her service animal. If a service animal behaves in an unacceptable way and the person with a disability does not control the animal, a business or other entity has the right to ask that the dog be removed. A business also has the right to deny access to a dog that disrupts their business or poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others. For example, if a service dog barks repeatedly or growls at customers, it could be asked to leave.\u201d\n\nhttps://adata.org/faq/how-can-i-tell-if-animal-really-service-animal-and-not-just-pet\n\n\nBasically if the dog is posing a danger or potential danger to other customers or disrupting the business they can be asked to leave. Keep in mind a dog barking once or twice does not nescesssrily mean this. Some service dogs are trained to bark in certain situations to alert their owners. Barking repeatedly, barking at other people, or acting aggressively are where you can take action.\n\n\nIf you need to remove a dog that is claimed to be a service dog, I would highly recommend making sure you get a video or some evidence of the dog behaving disruptively as well as a video of you asking them to leave. I would compare this legally to someone backing their car into the front of yours. Yes you are legally in the right, but the law assumes you are probably not. \n\nWhy Ysk: there has recently been a huge rise in people pretending their animals are service dogs. There is a large legal gray area and you should know how to handle a disruptive dog without causing yourself legal trouble \n\n(This is not legal advice and I am not a lawyer, it is simply a summary of online information from the ADA website and other legal websites)\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://adata.org/faq/how-can-i-tell-if-animal-really-service-animal-and-not-just-pet\n\nhttps://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/small-business/is-it-legal-to-ask-for-service-dog-papers/\n\nhttps://pettable.com/blog/can-you-legally-ask-for-proof-of-service-dog#:~:text=If%20it%20isn't%20obvious,disability%20or%20ask%20for%20medical\n\nhttps://www.servicedogregistration.org/blog/how-to-prove-dog-is-service-dog/",

Regardless of the answers, the dog may or may not be disruptive, since not all service animals have the same level of training.\n\nService animals can be any dogs trained to help a disabled person. They dont need to be professionally trained/licensed/registered, these options dont even exist in an officially recognized capacity.\n\nSo the only thing that legally makes a dog a service animal, is that its needed by a disabled owner, and that its capable of performing some tasks for its disabled owner. If these two requirements are not met, then the dog cannot be considered legally to be a service animal.\n\nFor instance, emotional support animals, do not perform specific tasks that the owner cannot complete themselves due to a disability. So they arent service animals.\n\nBut if you were to train a chihuahua to retrieve dropped objects from the floor for someone in a wheelchair, even if you did the training yourself. That dog would legally be considered a service animal.",

This was something like 10 years ago, and I recall crazy stories coming out of the news about \"emotional support animals\" wreaking havoc on airplanes (a pig popped all over a plane IIRC?).\n\nI recall a time we were waiting at the gate for early boarding and I could see people staring at me and hear nearby comments about my dog. I was already really nervous, and this made it worse, so I ended up visibly showing my disability in a mildly exaggerated way by shaking my free hand off and on and crouching down to give my small-medium dog excessive attention. This killed me a little on the inside, because I've always tried to mask my disabilities to vaguely fit in with neurotypical people. It worked though, people stopped commenting and started looking away.\n\nThankfully I was eventually able to mostly overcome that form of anxiety with therapy and I don't have to fly with my aging dog with me anymore.",

Service animals are highly trained, focused on their person, rarely cause issues even in chaotic situations. People who demand their pets be treated the same rarely put the time and energy into training them, the animals are easily distracted and just have a different body language in general. Also the person usually gives it away by nervously telling everyone who glances that \"it's a service dog\" where someone with a genuine service dog usually only says that if questioned.",

There are psychiatric service dogs who are task trained to mitigate a panic/anxiety attack or help their handler recover from one (deep pressure therapy, blocking, guiding to less overwhelming spaces, etc are all tasks for this purpose). Psychiatric service dogs are also used for PTSD, depression, autism, and more but people may find an ESA within their home helpful for these same issues. It's very important that the distinguishable difference we educate people on is that a service dog is task trained and public access trained while an ESA is not. ESAs do not have access rights because they are not trained. A dog existing near someone as a comfort or support is not considered a task under the ADA which is why ESAs aren't legally covered under the ADA",

If a person comes in with a dog and says it\u2019s a service animal we have to take them at their word, even if it isn\u2019t wearing a cape or vest. We are not allowed to ask what their need for it is, we are not allowed to ask for proof of any kind and we\u2019re not even allowed to ask if it\u2019s a service animal because that\u2019s discrimination. The only time we can ask is if the dog is not behaving or is acting in a manner not acceptable for a service dog. I\u2019ll give you one guess as to how that\u2019s been working out.",

The lack of sleep makes the nightmares worse, which makes the sleep worse... Just around and around. \n\nTraditional therapy for it hasn't helped, but Jazzy does. When I have a nightmare, she presses herself against my chest and purrs. When I wake up, the purring grounds me and helps me go back to sleep. Over time, it keeps my nightmares under control. \n\nI don't take her to the restaurant or on vacation (often - I'm heading to a two month teacher training and she'll be staying in my parents RV with me). What she helps with is a long term mental illness, that doesn't improve without her. \n\nWhat this means is that my landlord doesn't charge me pet fees or rent, because they're trying to make sure I don't have to pay out the nose for having a pet that demonstrably improves my ability to function.

Many dogs wash out of the training program because they can't meet the requirements. Chances are if the dog IS misbehaving it isn't a service dog at all. \n\nThat said, by all means document any misbehavior before asking them to leave. Honestly, I do the same when humans are misbehaving. It just saves so many headaches.",

Their only obligation is that they offer their service.\n\nI would recommend to a business owner that they try to accommodate both and create distances between the two. But if one of them decides they want to leave to provide them with compensation of some sort for the inconvenience and encourage them to return another time.",

My second dog is large enough that she will also be trained as a mobility support dog to help me walk when needed.

My blood sugar has been so low I was at risk of going into a coma (I was in the hospital and was able to be treated but didn\u2019t have my dog that night so he wasn\u2019t able to alert me) basically in short my dog can save my life and potentially already has prevented life threatening situations, he keeps me safe and healthy.

It would also require documentation of the disabling condition, which again adds a barrier since accessing providers can be difficult in and of itself and because there can be many hoops to jump through for a provider to officially document a person having a disability requiring assistance. Consider how long it takes for people to get put on disability and the restrictions they have to follow (it takes YEARS and they have restrictions like people not being allowed to have more than $2,000 in savings at any time). I get why people want registries to exist, but just a little critical thought makes it obvious why we don\u2019t have them.",

A person can know they have seizures without having documentation saying so. A person can know they have issues with low blood sugar without having documentation saying so. A person can know they have visual impairments without having documentation officially declaring them blind.\n\nIs it better to have an official diagnosis of these things? Of course. But the reality is that that just isn't always financially accessible for everyone. So documentation doesn't always exist prior to the point when that person could reasonably benefit from a  service dog, but it is still possible for a person with any of those conditions (and many others) to self-train a service dog to provide services for them.",

The vast majority of them are adopted (after screening for things like temperament) and then owner-trained, usually with some training classes or one on one training with a dog trainer to fill in the gaps that the owner cannot do themselves. Yes, training is expensive, but that alone does not cost 10\u2019s of thousands of dollars. There aren\u2019t a set list of things a dog needs to be trained to do to be considered \u201cfully trained\u201d. It\u2019s all individualized for the person needing to dog, and training is a continuous process throughout the lifetime with the dog. And many people with service dogs don\u2019t have official documentation of their disability since, as I said, accessing providers and having them document the disability, or the need for assistance from a service dog, is not easy for many people. Consider providers who don\u2019t believe in the disabling condition or who have no understanding of it, who don\u2019t believe the condition warrants a service dog, who don\u2019t understand the service dog\u2019s purpose or ability to help the patient (many are completely unaware of what a dog can assist with), and so on. Or consider people who can\u2019t even afford to get to a provider or see a specialist, either due to poverty, lack of insurance, or both.

For example, you could get a puppy from a friend or relative, have no paperwork on it whatsoever, and it can be a bona fide service animal. The only paperwork requirements of any kind might be if your city requires all animals to have proof of rabies vaccine or similar requirements. If you don't have those requirements, you can have a service animal you trained yourself, that you have zero paperwork for. Therefore, they can't require paperwork.\n\nOne can tell a bona fide service animal from an impostor usually on sight. Bona fide service animals do their job and other than that, they do their best to pretend to not exist. A seeing eye dog for the blind, for example, will usually kind of hide under or near the table while its owner is eating. This makes it extremely easy to spot impostor animals a mile away. If an animal is straining at its leash, seeking attention in any way, or whining, sticking its nose into people's space, being anything other than attentive and obedient-- or if the owner says \"sure, you can pet him!\"-- it's not a service animal. However, the law wants to protect the disabled more than it does the public, and so if you want to challenge a service animal, you take on some serious liability. Therefore, most businesses choose to look the other way regarding service animals.\n\nPaperwork doesn't create a service animal either, although there are lots of registries that will tell you that it does. You can buy service animal kits online, with official-looking registration papers and vests and everything. Don't be fooled by these, they have no more legitimacy than Name a Star registries or becoming a Scottish Lord by buying a square foot of land in some Scottish forest somewhere.\n\nIt would be entirely possible to train a pet with such discipline that the pet would pass as a service animal. However, the Venn diagram of \"people who try to pass their pets as service animals\" and \"people who train their pets with great discipline and obedience\" is just two circles.",

If you ask any of those questions about the little shaky, yapping, bug eyed chihuahua in an ugly ass sweater that the chronically dirty looking 400lbs trashy woman in Walmart is lugging around and she instantly gets hostile then you can bet your ass it isn\u2019t any kind of service animal. \n\nAlso.. it\u2019s fucking disgusting when I have to leave the goddamn store and all of my groceries because I sat my toddler down in your dogs piss because you put it\u2019s scared of the wind ass in the baby seat of the shopping cart, you inbred fucks!

But then there are people who *claim* service dogs who are not. They just want to bring their pets into a place of business. I'm fine with those who bring their well trained, quiet dogs into Home Depot or a retail store, I don't care.\n\nWent to a Dairy Queen for an ice cream cone. A woman brought her small dog in the restaurant with her. Fine. But *then* ... the dog was whining and squirming. He wanted out. To quiet him she picked the dog up and placed it on the *table* in a booth. A *table*, where people eat. The dog's genitals were on the surface as he splayed his four legs trying to grip the surface. He was agitated until she had to pull him down into the booth seat and restrain him ... he was so disobedient the couple left. This is *not* a service dog; I've never known one that unmanageable.\n\nI've known service dogs who were supremely calm and well behaved ... this wasn't one. I complained to the staff. \"I can't help that. We can't challenge a service dog.\" I said, \"That wasn't a service dog. Do you want to wipe that table down before someone eats their burger there? You might want want to check if that dog leaked urine on the table.\" Confusion and no answer.\n\nAnother time, a local grocer; a woman picked up her small dog and put it in one of those short, small grocery carts ... this, after the dog walked across the parking lot and his paws are in the cart where people place their groceries. I complained to the manager ... I told him I was a vet and I didn't want my food where that dog sat. He agreed and told the woman she was welcome to bring her dog in but not to put it in the grocery cart. She left.\n\nThere is a difference between a companion pet and a service dog. I only wanted to make that distinction.",

It would also require documentation of the disabling condition, which again adds a barrier since accessing providers can be difficult in and of itself and because there can be many hoops to jump through for a provider to officially document a person having a disability requiring assistance. Consider how long it takes for people to get put on disability and the restrictions they have to follow (it takes YEARS and they have restrictions like people not being allowed to have more than $2,000 in savings at any time). I get why people want registries to exist, but just a little critical thought makes it obvious why we don\u2019t have them.",

Law here says if it's not a service animal it can be denied. Service animals are harder to define but basically they DO STUFF they get certified for (like a seeing eye dog guiding it's human or an epilepsy dog giving warnings,) while ESAs don't, without said certificate from a very few companies it's not a service animal. Page explaining the laws also explicitly says (in mild legalese) that ESAs are legally PETS and have no legal protection/standing. This was all in the context of rental housing, got no clue about needing proof or carrying documents or whatever but I'd imagine it's similar to US laws and folks don't need to carry proof. Have seen many folks with agro dogs getting kicked out of stores but also see many folks with pet dogs in shopping carts, no clue how it works for retail atores/workers, apologies",

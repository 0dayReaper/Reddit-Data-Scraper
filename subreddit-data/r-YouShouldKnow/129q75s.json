    "postText": "I can't say it better than Abandonded Rabbits does, and Why YSK:\n\nContrary to successful but deceptive pet-industry marketing, these social and intelligent creatures are not short-lived, low-maintenance, or cheap pets that are suitable as \u201cstarter\u201d pets for children. They are 10+ year commitments that require expert vet care, close attention, and patience.\n\nSadly, shelters and rescues see a large spike in abandoned rabbits during the few months after Easter. Owners and parents are often shocked to learn that rabbits require regular, specialized vet care and alteration to prevent reproductive cancers, decrease territorial behaviour, and prevent unwanted litters.\n\nFurthermore, rabbits are social and active creatures that require lots of indoor space and stimulation to thrive, and prefer to live in groups of two or more. Children often lose interest in their now fully grown rabbit, who is often described as aggressive, fearful, or boring. What was originally intended to be a fun and easy pet for a child becomes an expensive burden to parents.\n\nTragically, many people decide to abandon their unwanted domestic rabbit outside, but this is a cruel death sentence. Studies estimate that at least 80% of all rabbits purchased at Easter die or are abandoned before their first birthday (Daly, 2017).\"\n\nIf you plan on getting a pet rabbit for your children or know people planning on doing that, please, please do your research and come in with the right expectation. I would recommend getting the kids a stuffed animal instead or a chocolate rabbit.\n\nA toy or candy will not feel neglected, but a rabbit is a 10+ year commitment.",

We get the rabbit out, I let it hop around for a second to get a respiratory rate, set it on the scale, and then our doctor comes in. They ask to take a look at the patient so I gently pick it up, it kicks its legs out several times so I immediately set it down again. Aaaaaaand then it crashes right there.\n\nAs cynical as I am about them and how much I jokingly advise not getting one. They\u2019re adorable and if cared for properly, make great pets",

Which of course means they're even more likely to get sick, because they've been eating some crappy food mix from a pet store that gives them bladder stones, and in some cases sitting in their filthy cage for ages breathing in ammonia etc.\n\nIn the end, it was too much. Even with insurance, vet bills get expensive. Teeth are not included in insurance because it's so common to have problems with. And we had to go to the closest large city that had an exotic vet, because the ones around here only do cats, dogs and farm animals (even though some claim they can take rabbits and Guinea pigs, they cannot). So that was over an hour car ride every time they needed the vet. And the endless support feeding when they were sick so they wouldn't just starve to death overnight. \n\nEven caring for them while healthy is quite a lot, because of how much space they require. And all the hay...\n\nBut yeah. New rule for any pets in our home is we need at least a good vet nearby. And have the energy, economy etc to not only care for that animal when healthy, but when sick. So I think we'll just stick with the one dog we have, she'll get all my energy and attention. Right now we're dog sitting, and it's great. The dogs get along, and he's a cutie. But it's fun for a couple of weeks, and as long as they're both healthy. And health is unfortunately never a guarantee. \n\nWe bought a dog from a healthy breed with no known genetic defects. She still needed double knee surgery for patella luxation before 2 years of age. And being a dog, we've needed to go to the vet twice because of food (once she ate raisins my niece had dropped on the floor, once she choked on dried meat and got it stuck in her throat). And that's not even counting the actual food sensitivities...\n\nYou never know, so now I assume any animal will have some health problems or scares and if I don't feel like I can handle that, I can't have another animal.",

The first 2 we got were a few weeks after Easter, the family who originally bought them took them back to the shop after they \u201cwouldn\u2019t perform tricks\u201d, so we ended up adopting. We\u2019ve adopted all our rabbits, but the other Easter related story is with one of our current girls Lily. She was bought as an Easter present for a 3 year old, who immediately got bored after 10 minutes of hitting her. They kept Lily shut inside this tiny hutch for months without cleaning it out, the kid would sometimes come to see her only to hit her again and they were just throwing food at her every morning. When the family finally surrendered her back to the pet shop and we adopted her, she was severely overweight with massive trust issues. We worked so hard to get her to a healthy weight, which we were able to do in about 6 months, and although she can still be scared of people she\u2019s come to trust us enough to let us handle her, brush her fur, cut her nails etc. Rabbits need so much care and attention, they require a lot more space than people realise and they certainly aren\u2019t good first pets for very young kids.",

So every morning, I would call him to come get a tiny piece of crust. I thought it would be neat to train him to wait for his bread on a small step stool, so one morning a lured him on it and gave him his treat as a reward. After three mornings, he had figured out that 'Chibi, bread!\" now meant that he could come into the kitchen, jump on the stool and recieve his treat. \n\n\\-I had to change the name of an adopted rabbit, which was Banana, because her new partner absolutely knew what a banana was and her name caused a lot of confusion and disappointment. (Most rabbits absolutely love bananas, but Banana was kind of mean.) So Banana became Hana, which she understood in less than two weeks. \n\n\\-Hana was also a sassy little shit and while she unfortunately died much too young (she had developed a lot of health issues due to neglect in her first year of life), she did find the time to learn about half a dozen tricks and develop a 'vocabulary' of atleast 20 words. \n\n\\-A rabbit I fostered was so fat, his stomach was practically on the floor when he hopped. I put him on a diet and gave him 50% of his feed (excluding hay) inside puzzles and other toys. That chonky food motivated boy figured out all of them.",

Hutches make them prone to predators and keep them as sitting ducks to fearful stimuli. The wires on the cages are not good for their feet nor are they proficient in space even if they \u201cget garden time\u201d. It\u2019s not enough. They definitely tend to get sick and die younger. \n\nThey should be spayed and neutered (is essential with litter box training) and that will cost more than a dog or cat as their heart rates are higher and need more anesthesia. Think hundreds of dollars. They should be free roamed or in a pen so that takes tons of space and you have to bunny proof your home. They love wires, plants, anything wood, rugs, fabrics, couches, tables, chairs, and clothes to chew and destroy. You have to bunny proof. If they eat the wrong thing they could need surgery to fix them. You constantly have to buy or make them new toys to enrich them and help with their need to chew in a positive and productive way. There\u2019s grooming and shedding. They are not usually cuddly, they like your companionship and will follow you from room to room and sit next to you but holding them can trigger their prey responses and be a scary experience for them. They need fresh veggies every week. They need constant and unlimited access to hay or it could kill them (they are a grazing animal their gut needs to constantly move). Little kids are too high energy and stressful for them. \n\nThey are really not for everyone. If any of this sounds like too much they are not the pet for you and by not doing this stuff you\u2019d be failing them. 100% agree with this ysk post.",

            "comment": "Completely agree. As someone fooled by fancy and cute advertising, I can 100% say that owning a rabbit was one of the biggest mistakes I\u2019ve ever made. Rabbits need constant attention and a rather large space to live in. They can\u2019t be cooped up in a tiny cage all day, which most people probably won\u2019t care about if they have one, which will lead to neglect of the animal, at best. \n\nOn top of that they shit at absolutely all hours of the day. And it\u2019s not in a nice little pile like dog\u2019s either. It comes out as pellets that get EVERYWHERE, and can be incredibly difficult to spot if you have decently thick carpet. Also, if they\u2019re left out they WILL eat any paper you have lying on the bottom shelf or within reach, this includes wallpaper. \n\nRabbits are very high care animals, and a lot of research should go into what you need and how to care for one before you get one, especially to avoid giving them heart attacks. No matter what I don\u2019t think a young child can legitimately be expected to take proper care of a rabbit. They\u2019re very amazing animals if you know how to care for them, but yea, a bunch of people underestimate the sort of undertaking they really are. Keep loving rabbits, but love them from a distance if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing!\ud83d\udc07",

Especially if they are dyed different colors, this cruel sales tactic has been made illegal in many states, thankfully. \n\nBut people still buy undyed chicks, though. Then once they grow into a fully adult chicken they can no longer keep properly, they too are neglected and abandoned and often die. And that's when they aren't neglected to death before they even reach adulthood. \n\nReally, any live animals should NEVER be given as a surprise gift to anyone. If you know someone who wants a particular kind of pet, they are aware of its care needs AND have parental permission ahead of time it is better to gift them what they need to care for that animal properly and perhaps a gift card to pay for the pet itself. Then let them go pick out the pet they want AFTER they have already set up the habitat. That's the right way to \"gift\" someone a pet, not just \"Surprise! Here's an Easter bunny!\"",

My ex boyfriend had like 15 hens and I loved getting stuff for them like kale, cantaloupes, watermelons and all kinds of fruits and veggies. He didn't really seem to think it was necessary to give them that stuff but I insisted because I knew that with a highly varied diet they would recover better from being kept in battery cages before he got them. They quickly figured out I was the one with the yummy goodies like apples and cabbage and they'd run up to me every time I showed up with a grocery bag. I made them birdie bread with the powdered eggshells he'd save for me and those girls got fully feathered out again within a few months. \n\nI'd love to have a couple of hens now but this neighborhood has a strict no livestock rule, which kinda pisses me off because hens don't make a lot of noise. Not like all 8 million of the dogs in here. That a lot of people just let run loose. \ud83d\ude44\n\nChickens are actually really cool pets, I just hate the way people will go buy a couple of chicks for their kids as a surprise Easter gift and then they get neglected or tossed aside once they start growing out of the fuzzy little chick stage. That makes me mad, because they can live to be 10 years old or more.",

They're very easy once you know what you're doing, but very easily neglected if you don't.\n\nThe absolute smallest enclosure mice can be kept in is a 20g long tank, and that's the bare minimum for a single buck (male), does (females) must be kept in groups, and so will need at least a 40g.\n\nMales must be kept alone, or they'll kill one another.\n\nThey shouldn't be fed seed only diets and need a lab pellet, but the lab pellets made for mice kind of suck a lot, so what they actually need is a rat lab pellet (Oxbow regal adult rat is my favorite), or a quality dog food (but not cat food as a staple), they also benefit from a variety of treats like seeds, nuts, vegetables, and insects (mealworms or young dubia roaches are good for this).\n\nThey also need deep bedding to burrow, no wood chips. Paper bedding is okay, hay is also pretty good. I really love a mixture of coconut coir and vivarium moss. It's cool to watch them tunnel along the sides of the enclosure.\n\nAs a fun fact however, mice are one of the only pets you can share your chocolate with! They evolved so closely alongside humans that they're basically the only animal other than rats that it doesn't kill. In fact, the caffeine in dark chocolate is really helpful if they get a URI (upper respiratory infection), you can mix it with their meds and not only does it encourage them to eat it, but the caffeine helps open their little lung tubes up so they can breathe easier.",

They need proper nutrition, shelter, exercise, and veterinary care. Many people are unaware of the long-term commitment required for owning a rabbit, which leads to a large number of abandoned rabbits in shelters and rescues after the initial novelty wears off.  \nInstead of giving a live animal as a gift, I agree that it is better to give children stuffed animals or chocolate rabbits.

I hated those fucking crabs. Even though I provided the minimum amount of maintenance and care, I couldn\u2019t wait for them to be dead. \n\nIn retrospect, thanks mom!

He decided he wanted rabbits more than anything in the world and built this insane structure to house them that was like half the size of our actual house. He took care of them and everything and he had these adorable little leash vests so he could \"walk\" them but after the initial cuteness wore off I found them to be a massive pain in the ass. One of his mama rabbits was a total serial killer and kept killing her babies and everyone else's babies too. And talk about mess. Those things shit 24/7 I'm pretty sure. And the white rabbits have red demon eyes. Making eye contact always gave me the creeps. He also told me to tip toe over to them because if I scared them they'd have a heart attack and die but idk if he was just messing with me or not. There was very little reward to owning them.",

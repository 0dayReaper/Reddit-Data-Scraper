For $7/year (not month!) , I have a 100 Megs on the Sprint network that I can use for emergency purposes. There are multiple eSIM marketplaces out there that offer a ton of flexibility on price/duration/network/size. If you enable wifi calling, you can even make calls when you don't have primary network access. Good for a pinch!",

Which what I use a primarily for data, as it has wider 5G coverage. But I also have Globe's GOMO on SIM #2 with 30GB of non-expiring data for also $8. I mainly use this for calls as this network allows me to convert some of my data  into minutes and texts (1GB gives me 15 minutes, or 0.2GB gives me 30 texts). \n\nI don't go out of the house often, so that $16 lasts me a really long time. About 6-9 months.\n\nOne time, I was out of town. SIM #1 didn't dignal, but the other did. So I was able to switch to that.",

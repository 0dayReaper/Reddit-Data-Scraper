    "postText": "Why YSK: There is a lot of discussion and debate happening regarding health care and medical care. There are laws being passed that go against common medical knowledge, information and statistics. With this many people like to bring up the \"hippocratic oath\" as though it's some panacea that prevents any wrongdoing. It's not and it's not legally binding. What you're talking about is medical malpractice and that has a much higher bar of evidence to clear.\n\nThis is important to remember because while it may be unethical, immoral or unprofessional for doctors to follow oppressive laws the oath has nothing to do with it.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath\n\nhttps://www.malpracticeohio.com/the-hippocratic-oath-past-present-and-future/#:~:text=The%20Hippocratic%20Oath%2C%20contrary%20to,and%20ethical%20advice%20to%20doctors.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482690/\n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-myth-of-the-hippocratic-oath-201511258447\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/doctors-aren-t-actually-bound-by-the-hippocratic-oath-1465044222",

The Dr. Death documentaries that covered Dr. Duntsch have shown first-hand that they'll prioritize covering for and protecting their own even at the expense of the patient. It would honestly be a surprise if they are legally bound to anything while practicing. And this was only one of the most famous examples, who knows what else goes on. \n\nThe only other people that stand a chance against a doctor are other doctors. Even then that chance is slim since the accusing doctor risks their career even more than the offending doctor since setting a precedent requires accountability across the board.   \n\n\n&gt;!Ironic that the wikipedia page says \"not to be confused with Hypocrisy.\" I'm not so sure about that. The definition seems to fit perfectly in this case. !&lt;",

It actually started with a horribly fraudulent long-distance moving broker. Seriously... there is so much I could (and maybe will someday) post about that. But, the simpler thing you should know is something you will encounter much more frequently. Almost being run off the road by a tractor-trailer. Short of calling the police, who will only really pull them over for something you have evidence of or is incredibly egregious, you can always report unsafe driving to the FMCSA. Nice thing it is adds up over the years and if they get a bad enough safety record then consequences will follow. Just get the driver's license plate number and the other number printed on the back of their truck - it's usually in the upper right. I take a picture. Then go to the link below and report the unsafe driving. \nWhy YSK - Here's to safer roads, fewer deaths!  \nhttps://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/consumer-protection/report-safety-violations",

If for no other reason you should be awarded for letting everyone know there's an agency to report them.\n\nOne once took more than 10 days more to move my household 600+ miles than they'd \"guaranteed\" and wanted 2k more to deliver once they did get to the new apartment. Where I had been sleeping on a blow up mattress and sitting in a plastic chair. \n\nSince my new company was paying and had already cut the check based on the \"guarantee,\" and I had NOTHING left after the move (about $50 in my account and it would be 2 weeks until payday - yep that was for food and gas), I laughed in the driver's face. I had hired labor to move the big stuff and they were standing around on the clock and I threatened to bill HIS company for every single dollar I had to pay the movers for doing nothing. He caved pretty quickly. \n\nI can put on the \"scary pissed off mom face\" when I need to. Plus, \"Keep the damn shit - most of it is curb and trash-picked furniture,\" has a tendency to shut down the scam.",

I was also in a third right lane that is restricted to passenger cars only. \n\nHe did it because he was an asshole. RIO TRUCKING, and you know he was a piece of shit because their is no contact information anywhere. \n\nI worked in trucking for years. Fuck these clowns. There may be a few good ones left, but most are hyped up on amphetamines and are accidents are waiting to happen.\n\nYour truck is 40 tons, then why the fuck don't YOU drive like that and not risk the lives so you can overtake another semi going a half an mph slower.",

If you were just chillin there. You were putting yourself in an escape zone. You dont know what was going on on the other side of that trailer. You couldnt have been aware of the entire situation.\n\nI call BS. Trucking has been HARDCORE on drug use for the last two decades and you literally put yourself in danger by driving in an escape zone. \n\nEven if its restricted. Hanging out there blinds you. \"Oh you know he did it intentionally\"\n\nDid it even OCCUR to you that either A) he nudhed the line to get you to either pass or back away.\nB) somebody else was fuckin with him by cutting him off or invading his lane on the other side.",

And then says \"oh yeah i have every rrason to sit in a dangerous spot. Knowing full well your Entirely blind to the events then could cause him to need that spot.\n\nI hate when people sit by me in the highway.\n\nEither pass. Or back off . But dont hang out there knowing your in a dangerzone. Because then i have to watch you and then while im watching you i am now blind to some idiot on my right thinking hes a teenage Dom or some old lady who forgets shes not clear yet \n\nIf you claim to be in this world. Dont put your self in shitty spots and then say \"oh yada yada.\"\n\n\nFuckin entitled ass 4wheelers who think they can just put their lives on the line and expect it to work out \n\nChances are.either was IN a blind spot. Or they werent even aware of the entire scenaro. \n\nIn other words. Dont hang out by tandems. Especially if you know its an unsafe area to be.\n\nAnd excuse me. I have every right to escape not just danger. But to prevent the life taking of some idiot on my other side. \n\nUnless your proposing i should just let them decimate both my vehicle. My life.

            "comment": "My problem with truckers is essentially that they are regular people. By that I mean that they are prone to the same stupid behaviors and making the same careless mistakes that everyone else makes, except they are also piloting a big ol truck with a big ol trailer on busy highways where the impact of their mistakes has the potential to be more severe. \n\nI see a lot of people in regular cars making frantic lane changes with no signal (or turning on the signal in middle of the lane change when they are already crossing lines. Like, what the hell is the point then?), cutting people off at the last second with no warning simply because they decided they weren't where they wanted to be at that second or because they waited until it was too late to get into the right position. I see trucks doing the same thing constantly.\n\nI see a lot of people in regular cars camping the left lane and being unable to keep a consistent speed, drifting between 60 and 80 and causing everyone to do the accordion behind them. I see trucks doing the same.\n\nI see a lot of people in regular cars driving aggressively and offensively because they're in a hurry or they're butthurt that you sped up to get around them. I see trucks doing the same.\n\nBut, I also see that many truckers have an attitude of \"I'm in the big vehicle, you get out of my way\", and they just do as they please and blame other vehicles for incidents or near misses because \"they shouldn't have been in my blind spot\" or \"I'm 70 feet long so you make room for me\". This is all purely anecdotal, but I've worked a lot of former truckers, and in my last and current job I deal with truckers all day long. Many of them have no problem telling you that they'll just flip on their signal and start changing lanes, and you better just move.\n\nI was complaining to a coworker a while back about how a truck was trying to merge into the right lane from the middle up several cars length ahead of me, but that the right lane was also actively slowing down as people were trying to take and exit while navigating around the people getting on the highway from the ramp. I guess the truck wanted the exit, but waited until the last minute to try to get in the correct lane, and then couldn't adjust his speed correctly or wait for someone to make him a gap. He ended up right next to me and I was trying to make him a gap without getting rear ended by the guy behind me, but then the truck just started coming on over, forcing me into the shoulder. My coworker's response was something to the effect of \"I turn on my signal and give 3 seconds, and then I'm coming over.\"\n\nMaybe he really had no idea I was there, because as I was slowing down to make him a gap, I was in his blind spot and he thought he was good. Maybe I should have just kept my speed and let him figure it out at the next exit. Maybe he should have been in the lane he needed way before then.\n\nAlso, a trucker just straight up shit on the ground outside yesterday, 30 feet from the door to my office trailer where I have a nice, clean restrooms for these guys. It's stupid how much trucker poop I've dealt with.a",

There are some who are distracted, sleepy, otherwise engaged, on the phone etc. And then there are the ones that just don't care about anyone else on the road. And sometimes, if there is just one incident you can't tell which one the person is. But when something happens over and over, creates a pattern, and is done by one particular truck, it's pretty obvious what category they fall into. The dangerous one. And uhh..... shitting outside? Yeah that is only okay is rare circumstances. And the circumstance you describe certainly does not meet the criteria for acceptability. \ud83e\udd22 Sorry you had to experience that!",

If you\u2019re comfortable traveling on roads parallel to 81, for long stretches you can ride on rt11 and go the same way but a bit slower. If it\u2019s raining you might want to on the more hilly stretches. At the bottom of some of the steeper hills water pools when it\u2019s raining hard enough and those are the spots you\u2019ll see most of the accidents happen. So if you\u2019re on it in the rain be prepared to deal with a bit of hydroplaning as you transition from the bottom of the hill to the incline.",

You tend to either already be the type to eschew society's norms or you slowly become one.  They are still great salt of the earth people if you can look past your own hang ups.  Just like any group their are of course shitty outliers but most are fine people.\n\nIt's also one of the few career fields a convict can hope to get a second chance at life in.  Again they are also away from people, for many reasons that can be beneficial to someone who is not yet fully ready to integrate into society.\n\nTruckers are a wonderful and diverse group, excepting fanatical political opinions aside (a small minority).\n\nSource: Was a recruiter for years (the real scum, why I quit)",

Though I don't really believe that a positive stereotype (salt of the earth) is any more accurate. \nI've commented on a few other replies about understanding some of the things that cause these dangerous interactions. In my case, this truck could clearly see me, I was driving plenty fast, but he just wanted to go 85 downhill and could only manage 65 uphill. So he kept weaving in and out of lanes, and kept finding himself behind me going 80 downhill in a 70, and didn't think that was fast enough. The trucker may have been a lovely person, but wasn't being respectful of others on the road that day, and was putting my life and others in serious danger. One report to this agency doesn't end this trucker's career. But it will add up and begin to put pressure on the company to reward their drivers for driving more safely. Or get the government on their backs, whichever they prefer.",

I pay a lot of attention while driving, which is why in the most recent incidence, I kept noticing that it was the same truck - it was just white with minimal markings so if I wasn't paying attention, I would have written it off as ALL trucks suck. That's not true. I also understand that truckers often get paid the ebst if they can complete the most jobs is the fastest time, and that means they may not want to go 62 in a 70, but then they can only manage 65 in the 70 and it's not fair for cars to be stuck behind them either. Not fair also isnt' something I'd report for. It';s the dangerous cutting in an out and tailgating that is, well, dangerous.

Especially in bumper to bumper traffic with idiotic cars cutting in front. \n\nI always feel extra alert when I\u2019m next to a rental truck or some no name company. But next to chemicals, Walmart trucks, etc, I feel fine. They\u2019re great drivers. \n\nThe other 10% of the time is when a trucker is on their phone or falling asleep at the wheel and it swerves into other lanes. This goes for all vehicles anyway it\u2019s just trucks are so heavy and dangerous that bad things are exponentially more disastrous.",

One only needs to spend about 5 minutes in a truck stop or truck mechanic shop to figure out you are dealing with the bottom of the fucking barrel when it comes to intelligence. But I'm sure you think it takes a genius to figure out if you should press the gas or brakes. Most truckers are truckers because how much they have failed at all basic aspects of life.",

That may be true for some cases, but that's akin to saying all blue collar workers lack intelligence simply because \"any schmuck\" can go work in a factory pushing buttons and packing boxes.\n\nFor me personally, I have a double major bachelor's as well as multiple certifications. I was in nursing before I became a truck driver. My husband was in the military. We chose to do this over 8 years ago not out of a lack of opportunities elsewhere, but because we could get paid well to travel the country together. Many truckers that I've met are college educated and/or very well experienced.\n\nSo no, your statement \"most truckers are truckers because how much they have failed at all basic aspects of life\" is simply untrue and stereotypical. It's a shame that you think this way, but I hope you will take the chance to meet and learn about the people you think so lowly of.",

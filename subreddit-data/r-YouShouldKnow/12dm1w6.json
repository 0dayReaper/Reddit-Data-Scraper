I would imagine a big part of that \u201csmokers are 70% more likely to experience hearing damage\u201d bit comes from the fact that people who engage in activities that damage hearing are more likely to smoke. Any type of blue collar work exposes you to high decibel levels, and many blue collar workers smoke. Musicians regular damage their hearing, and in my experience playing semi professionally, many musicians smoke. People that party and hang out in loud bars or clubs damage their hearing, and they also tend to smoke. Expose anyone, smoker or non smoker, to sounds over 80dB for an extended period of time, and they\u2019ll all develop hearing damage. \n\nThe real motivation to quit should be that it\u2019s bad for your heart and lungs. I find these kinds of studies annoying, if cancer and heart disease aren\u2019t motivations to quit then why would having a minute (if any) chance of loosing hair or hearing motivate people to quit?

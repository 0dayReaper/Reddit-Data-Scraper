If you have evidence, you will probably win, as it\u2019s not your bank who has to pay to make the situation right\u2014and it\u2019s also your bank who is favored in these disputes.  There\u2019s some paperwork to fill out, but it\u2019s worth your time for most transactions.",

By 5pm *that same day* I was on a Swiss Air flight back to Chicago, with an overnight layover in Zurich. Hotel and flight booked for me by AmEx at the very last minute. \n\nI got home just before midnight on November 2nd. Dad died on the 4th. Without American Express I don't think I would have made it on time. Getting flights in and out of communist Eastern Europe in 1989 wasn't as easy as it would be today.",

I decided to use my personal Discover card because it had been a long day of flying already and it was a Sunday so no one was in the finance department at my company to help us. As we left the airport garage, I got a call from Discover because the charge was from an area I haven\u2019t used it in before. Quick exchange with the rep and all was good, but it gave me a great feeling of security that they were watching out for me. \n\nSecond was about a year ago, again on a Sunday.  Got a text saying there was suspicious activity on my card and to call their fraud support line. I figured yeah, no one will answer on a Sunday, but called anyway. To my surprise, they answered right away and resolved the problem in minutes (ten $.99 charges in two hours from a foreign account). No hassle, new card issued within five days. Awesome CS and protection!",

They are hoping you just won't fight them, know better, or report them. Chargebacks are not your only weapon as a consumer. Plus they will cover things like fraud when an item received is not what was advertised. \n\nFor companies who say that if you don't receive your package then too bad, they handed it to the carrier, and they're not refunding you? Nope. They are responsible fully for getting the package to you. Their website terms do not matter. It is on them. They can file a claim with the carrier all they want but you do not have to wait for that garbage to settle. \n\nThe package protection, carbon neutral, package insurance, extra charge they ask you for? They fearmonger saying if you don't pony up then if your package is lost it's on you?? ... lies. They legally can not do that, at all. You do not have to pay extra or else you're fucked. Skip it, they're pocketing that money. \n\nAnd FYI any packages sent priority USPS mail auto come with a tracking number. I see places trying to charge for that too. No. They come with insurance up to a certain amount as well. \n\nAlso worth noting, the companies can and do close your accounts/ban you when you do chargebacks. That is fully legal for them to do. You have no right to an account or to buy from anywhere. \n\nAmazon in particular will lock your account if you do a chargeback and will not let you have another one until you pay back the money. This is one reason to try to work it out with a company first. Plus they can just be faster vs a chargeback. However, watch your timelines and companies stalling until it's too late for you to do a chargeback too. UberEats, DoorDash, etc will all ban you too.\n\nLastly, companies will fight chargebacks too. Expect it. If they can show proof of delivery with GPS?, that's all they need. UberEats has a picture of your house? That's good enough for them to win their case. \n\nTouching on that stolen goods are often a lost case and not the responsibility of any company anymore as they fulfilled their obligation. They just have to show proof of delivery to win a case. \n\nIt's also worth noting be nice to the customer service people. They do not make the rules.",

There was a popular flashlight merchant in China that offers $1 insurance on all orders. I never ordered from that merchant but it is kind of a tradeoff in some cases. \n\n\nIf they are unique enough and you actually want to be a repeat customer then its either pay the insurance or take the loss yourself if it never arrives.\n\n\nThe posts got even more interesting because the owner of that company was also posting replies and even started his own topic in response to previous threads.",

Companies that are hit with a certain number of chargebacks over a given period of time can have higher processing fees, or be terminated by the credit card processor altogether.",

By that I mean, if the amount of the dispute is small enough, the bank may just decide to give you money and close out the case, without even investigating or contacting the company.  It's cheaper.  \n  \nRule of thumb at our bank is each Reg E or Reg Z investigation costs the company about $200-$250 in various costs (mostly back office labor and case tracking, since we're audited by the regulatory agencies out the wazoo on Reg E/Z claims).  \n\nSo, if the bank receives a dispute, they have a bunch of rules in place to determine how to handle it.  If it falls below X dollars, and there has not been any other disputes in the past Y months, and the account is more than Z months old, and there have not been more than W dollar amount in disputes in the past V months, and...well, you get the idea.

But in some cases, a company might issue a refund if you explain the situation.\n\nI had that happen once. Fatfingered the wrong button in some cashgrab mobile game, accidentally the $99.99 option. I just said my niece did it by mistake, and they refunded it. Even let me keep the premium currency from the purchase, presumably because it would be difficult or unfeasible to redact it in that situation.\n\nTbh, in one of those nightmare scenarios where your preschooler puts like several thousand dollars worth of purchases through due to not understanding what they're doing, I'd think a lot of companies would issue a refund. That kind of stuff hits the media from time to time, and it's not great optics for the company. \n\nThat said, a company that would redact access to content that you *own* and paid for, probably wouldn't be reasonable or accommodating. \n\nIt's like if you walked into a Gamestop like, \"Hey, my son took my debit card without permission and bought this video game here on this disk. I'd like to return it.\" Then Gamestop walks into your house and confiscates your entire shelf of other games.",

Instead of doing what OP said you could just get a refund for your Doordash order in-app and you don't even need evidence for Doordash to side with you as the customer. A lot of customers select the option \"hand it to me,\" then message the dasher to just leave it at the door so that then when the Dasher arrives at the home they won't be promoted to take a picture. So BAM, now Doordash has no evidence of you getting the order and they will always side with the customer unless the driver was smart and took a photo/video of the food with your address # in view. It's a common scam that is abused and drivers get a mark on their account that goes away after 100 orders. Though if the customer does it too often then they can end up banned I believe but the point is that this tip is kinda useless because you can easily get your money back within the Doordash app, they even let you choose whether it be given back through in-store credit, or just back to your bank acct.",

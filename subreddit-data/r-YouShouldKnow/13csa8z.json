    "postText": "Why YSK: People often think that if a friend has a pet allergy, they just need to remove the pet from the room. While this will prevent the pet from jumping on or rubbing the affected person, this will not remove the allergens from the house or the air.\n\nWhen people are allergic to animals such as dogs and cats, they are allergic to the dander of that animal. This means that any fabric that the animal comes in contact with the animal will pick up dander, especially if the animal is constantly in contact with it, like carpets, rugs, and upholstered furniture.\n\n&gt; Dander allergens are sticky, and dander in soft materials, such as carpets, mattresses, upholstered furniture and clothing, can persist for long periods of time. Unless special steps are taken, pet dander can remain in a home for up to six months after the pet has been removed.\n\n(https://www.missionallergy.com/education-animal-dander-allergy#:~:text=Dander%20allergens%20are%20sticky%2C%20and,the%20pet%20has%20been%20removed.)\n\nIf you want to provide as allergen-free an environment as possible for a pet-allergic guest, then keeping the pet out of the room(s) you intend to have the person in for as long as possible before the visit coupled with frequent vacuuming, cleaning, and air filtration will be the most helpful. If possible, also providing non-upholsterd seating in rooms with wood floors is best. Wood floors and furniture trump cleaned carpets and couches every time.",

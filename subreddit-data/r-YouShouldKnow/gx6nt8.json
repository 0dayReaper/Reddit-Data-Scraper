    "postText": "That isn't to say that the volcano could *never* have another supereruption, but scientists do not believe it *ever will.*\n\nThe \"overdue\" myth stems from the average time between the three eruptions in the volcano's life. Which is the average of two numbers, which is functionally useless.\n\nBut even if it wasn't useless and it *was* rock-solid evidence of an eruption, we **still** wouldn't be overdue. There's still 100,000 years to go before we reach the average time between eruptions. \n\n For more information, [click here] (https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/yellowstone-overdue-eruption-when-will-yellowstone-erupt?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products)",

We should respect volcanoes! They live on this earth just like we do! This volcano hasn't erupted since we started keeping data on it, who's to say it ever will? I'm just looking for civility in this argument. And maybe, just maybe, recognition that George Soros funded the anti-volcano sentiment.",

The idea of describing it as being \"overdue for a 700,000 year eruption\" isn't accurate or precise because (a) eruptions don't occur at regular intervals, therefore one can't be 'due', per se  [well, specifically we can look at the historical record, but a small number of eruptions over a large number of years does not make a great dataset for statistics like averages to be meaningful or as the sole basis for making predictions] and (b) describing it as a '700,000-year eruption' is mostly shorthand rather than saying it is a 1 in 700,000 chance or whatever.\n\nThe issue with point (b) is that the phrase \"700,000 year eruption\" is taken literally, instead of looking at the basis for why it is described that way.\n\nI guess my bottom line here is that showing how someone might misinterpret \"we're overdue for a Yellowstone eruption\" might be more illuminating and comforting than flat out saying it's media trying to hype up fear.",

It should be noted that there has been increased seismic activity in the area which could suggest a magma plume rising to the surface. In some places, relative elevation is starting to rise and is coupled with some lakes going dry and increased seismic activity. This doesn\u2019t mean that Yellowstone is going to blow its top (well it\u2019s technically a caldera and doesn\u2019t have a traditional \u201ctop\u201d most would think of like a stratovolcano like in the movies), but it can possibly mean that there is something going on-which very well could be an eruption coming soon, which like I said, soon geologically could be a million years or more. \n\nAlso, there could be several smaller eruptions will will release some of the pressure from inside the chamber. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be \u201cKABOOM\u201d and all the pressure is released at once. \n\nSource: geologist",

The standard deviation ends up being massive though.  We just can't predict rare geologic or weather events. A city near me experienced two thousand year floods in three years.  That means the chance of that flood happening was 0.001% each year. The modeling is a bit fucked due to climate change, but still. However, previous to that they had not had a 0.01% flood for like 50+ years. And things like Yellowstone or massive earthquakes are on the order of 1 in 500,000 if not more.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"we are due.\" It just doesn't work that way.  That is literally the Gambler's / Monte Carlo fallacy.  The odds of the expected outcome increase as you move away from the center in a normal distribution. But that doesn't mean they will happen and with rare events you don't even know you are working with a normal distribution.",

If 300 years is the median time between earthquakes then approximately half will be \"overdue\" by that definition, which isn't really helpful. This is why statistics talk about probabilities of events occuring. For example \"what is the probability of having at least 320 years between earthquakes?\" Then you can assign a value to it and choose for yourself if it's \"overdue\" or not.",

Earthquakes are much more predictable. Strain is constantly accumulating on the fault plane because the tectonic plates (on either side of the fault plane) move at generally predictable and stable rates. So if you get frequent, low magnitude quakes across a locale, this relieves the strain, and you won't get a big quake. But if you go a long time without *any* quakes, you've got a lot of built up energy that needs to be released, and so you get a big quake. Personally I don't know the quake history of Vancouver so I can't tell you not to worry. But I'm sure there's a database where you can find some info.",

Some days you'd get what was effectively a TED talk in conversation form with all kinds of interesting people.  Other days you'd get a kind of an unpretentious Inside the Actor's Studio but with comedians, and it was fascinating hearing them talk about their craft in depth.  But somehow after all that exposure to smart and creative people, Rogan seems to have gotten dumber and dumber, so he repeats the same twelve talking points over and over and over and over until I just didn't bother listening anymore.  His obsession with chimps is cute after the first 100 times but then it just becomes tedious.  My theory is Joe's literally a gorilla who shaved himself down and learned to talk and now the mask is slipping.",

Volcanoes often erupt regardless of how solid the magma is so to speak, an eruption usually happens when volatile chemicals (like water and CO2) build up pressure when they revert back to gasses.",

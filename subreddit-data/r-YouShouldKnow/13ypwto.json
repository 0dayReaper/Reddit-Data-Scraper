In pregnant women, the fetus may experience neurological disorders, damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system.\n\nThe consumption of fish is endangering the health of people living in six of the seven states in the Northern region of Brazil, according to a study released by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation), Greenpeace Brazil, the Indigenous Research and Training Institute (Iep\u00e9), the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), and WWF Brazil.\n\n[https://brazilreports.com/fish-bought-in-markets-in-brazils-amazon-highly-contaminated-with-mercury-study/4909/](https://brazilreports.com/fish-bought-in-markets-in-brazils-amazon-highly-contaminated-with-mercury-study/4909/)\r  \n\n\nAccording to analyses conducted on fish samples, there are levels of mercury contamination far above what is considered safe for human consumption by the World Health Organization, which is 0.5 micrograms per gram of fish. In some cases, the levels were 31.5 times higher than the limit.\n\nMercury is widely used in illegal gold mining operations in the Amazon region during the process of separating gold from stones, mud, and other materials in rivers. For the researchers, finding such high levels of fish in cities far from the areas where the miners operate reveals that mercury contamination of fish is no longer solely an issue affecting indigenous communities.",

It's decently common in the soil in many parts of the world. \n\nThat being said, yes. A sudden increase of levels this high can be linked back to mining. Or even paper manufacturing.",

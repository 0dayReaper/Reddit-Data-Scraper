    "postText": "Why YSK: A lot of times it can feel hollow to just say that we understand how someone feels, so we mention a personal detail to illustrate why we understand. Problem is, it can come across as trying to use someone else's pain to talk about yourself. One way to avoid that is by making sure the attention remains on the person you're comforting.\n\n----\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\n\"I'm so sorry, I recently got laid off too.\"\n\nvs\n\n\"I'm so sorry, I recently got laid off too. How are you doing? Do you have anything lined up?\"\n\nStopping after the \"I\" statement implies a social cue for the other person to respond, thus shifting the focus to you. Immediately following it up with a question or two, however, establishes that you empathize while keeping the focus where it should be.",

After all, everyone is different.

Asking something like this too bluntly can still come off as \u201ccutting straight to business,\u201d so it could help to at least try and gauge what you think the other person is looking for and then ease into asking them, if you aren\u2019t sure. It all depends on how well you know the other person and the nature of your relationship with them. I can think of several friends who would be weirded out if I sprung this question on them when they start sharing things with me.",

I've yet to see a good argument for why a person can't relate to show empathy.\n\nIt sounds a lot more like, there are a lot of socially awkward people looking for silent empathy or echo chamber empathy.\n\nLet's just look at it like this, you could have just empathize with the person you disagreed with but chose to interject your2cents lol.

This YSK could easily be rewritten as \"YSK: some people will take anything you say the wrong way unless you say these words\"\n\nThe real YSK is that everyone is different, and that everyone processes grief differently, there is no one size fits all, and to imply that this is what to say so people don't think you're a dick, in disingenuous, and in reality, only some people will think your a dick, while others will love it.

Try saying \u201cI don\u2019t mean to make this about me at all-\u201c and then just speak from the heart. Or even just add \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later\u201d. \n\n- I\u2019ll only be anecdotal when it\u2019s appropriate, and not too soon or often while the person is confiding in me. If it really feels wrong though, I say\u2026\n\n- just don\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t have to. If it\u2019s not  about you, it\u2019s about them, so keep it about them for a while. When people are distressed, they need attention and comfort, and naturally don\u2019t care about hearing what you went through or why you can empathize. \n\n- Instead ask questions like \u201cWhat can I do to help? How do you feel about __? What will you do now/until then? What led up to that? What have you done to cope in the past? Etc.\u201d\n\n- If you want them to know you understand, you can just say \u201cYour experience is unique to you, but I want you to know I can empathize with some of your feelings here. Your feelings are valid\u201d or something like that, and then continue your discussion :)\n\n- use \u201cactive-listening techniques\u201d, which you can look up online pretty easily\n\nI\u2019ve learned that people love to insert themselves or being attention to their feelings and experiences without realizing it\u2019s not the right time or its not very therapeutic for the other person necessarily. If it feels awkward, save the anecdotes and empathize without stating why. \n\nGood luck! &lt;3",

Her response was, \"Yeah, everyone's had a big change.\" I recognize she was trying to empathize, but every time I'd say I was struggling, she'd say \"everyone else has been thru it.\"\n\nTo me it felt like my situation was being minimized as not important and I just needed to get over it like everyone else. Everyone else went thru it and came out fine, so why was in not able to adapt yet?\n\nI've made my return to my former self, for sure, but just wanted to share an example of how empathy and trying to say someone isn't alone in a situation can be read differently, at least in the moment.",

It is an absolutely horrible way to live your life, and will likely shorten your life due to always being upset at things people say to you. \n\nPeople that do this need some kind of therapy. It's one thing if there is obvious malice. But even then, they're just words. If you don't like the words, move on with your life, cut that person out of your life if you don't like it, but don't dwell on it and then go on to assume every other person that talks to you has bad intentions. This is toxic behavior.\n\nI hate YSK like these, because they excuse the behavior of the person jumping to conclusions. I understand some things are inappropriate to say, but sharing an intimate detail of your life to empathize in some way is certainly not inappropriate just because the person you said it to took it the wrong way",

Sympathy is understanding how they feel because you had a similar experience/can understand their feelings.\n\nThe beautiful message remains the same, and the people you are consoling will appreciate it whichever it is. Sympathy and empathy are two of the greatest human emotions, imo, because they are almost pure good.  It always helps to try to put yourself in the head of others.",

Sympathy is normally used pity or sorrow affected by another person's distress.

When you sympathize with someone that just lost a loved one, it doesn't imply that you also went through the loss of a loved one. If it does, that would be empathy.",

Gordon was a paleo-ethno-botanist who sometimes appeared in Ray Mears\u2019 TV shows. In one show he talks about how the mycology department at his university would package up the edible mushrooms after a lab class and drop them off at his office because he really liked mushrooms. But one day someone made a mistake and included a mushroom they shouldn\u2019t have. Gordon took them home, ate them, and then went to the pub for a pint. He said that about halfway through his pint his vision went monochrome. As he put it, \u201cnot black and white, blue and white\u2026\u201d Then he wrote down the name of the mushroom he suspected he had eaten and pinned it to his shirt, then promptly passed out. \n\nHe says in the show that if he hadn\u2019t written down the name of the mushroom paramedics and doctors probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to save him, but as far as I recall he never says in the show what it was he ate.",

Half a standard dose will have me snoring within 15 minutes. If I were to combine the two? That would be stupid and dangerous.\n\nJust look at how many celebrity deaths happen because of mixing alcohol with other depressants. And those are just the deaths you hear about because of their celebrity. Mixing drugs and alcohol is legitimately dangerous unless you know what you're doing, by which I mean you're a pharmacist or you've consulted with one to clear drinking with whatever medication you've taken.\n\nI'm not directing this at you personally; this is more a general PSA. To you I'd say don't let yourself be pressured into drinking if you don't enjoy it. I hate that there's societal pressure, especially on young people, to participate in drinking culture even if they don't like alcohol.",

Bossman was chill with me not drinking after checking if I was or not, then got me diet coke instead which was good\n\nHis son, more directly my manager, asked, asked why, I just kinda said I don't drink, he then a little while later had a 'japanese beer' that tastes nice? And offered me to try it - I politely declined and he didn't push it beyond that, which was a bit far but *ok*\n\nThen a rather drunk colleague kept trying to get me to join in with tequila shots. I didn't mind, he's a nice guy, he just wanted to make sure I was having fun and was too drunk to recognise what I was saying really, but if I were a recovering alcoholic and not just an 18 y/o who'd genuinely rather not, then there might have been bigger problems. That said, in that context he probably wouldn't have tried to get me to at all - \"universal law is for lackeys, context is for kings.\"",

An all time favorite of mine:\n\n- 4 oz black tea\n- 2 oz honey simple syrup\n- 1 oz pomegranate juice\n- 1 oz lemon juice\n- Dash of cinnamon\n\nIt's incredibly good and has a very similar flavor profile to alcohol. It's so similar that many women who aren't big drinkers think it's alcoholic and I've had them turn down refills down because they were driving and didn't want to get drunk.\n\nFresh lemonade with fruit puree is also fantastic\n\n- 4 oz water\n- 1 1/2 oz simple syrup\n- 1 oz lemon juice\n- 1 oz fruit puree\n\nAnother advantage of a mocktail menu is children can come up to the bar at a party and be handed an actual menu and order a fancy drink served like a cocktail. They absolutely love it because they feel like they're part of everything. I push mocktails on my guests pretty hard because of how proud I am of the menu and many people don't think to order it assuming it's going to be a poor quality cocktail replacement versus a fantastic drink that goes down like a cocktail.",

I managed to catch myself and quit drinking at 33. He made it to 64 before he croaked and he never stopped drinking even when his doctor told him he might as well buy a coffin the next time he buys liquor. Smart doctor.",

            "comment": "as someone who likes beer but is seriously tired of acid reflux, thank you. my old SO would always push beer on me after I\u2019d explain \u201cI have no self control, I will take it if it\u2019s offered, but I will be up all night eating tums. Don\u2019t offer me alcohol ever\u201d\n\nEvery single time she would practically whine at me for not wanting to drink with her. It was a lot harder to say no since I don\u2019t have a drinking problem and would be fine drinking at special occasions, but I really hated how little she respected my wishes. \n\nShe refused to let me just have a water out at the bar with her, it was like it took the booze out of her drink. Glad I\u2019m not with that toxic lady anymore. My dad does the same thing when I see him, pushes booze on me, but it\u2019s easier telling him to fuck off knowing he\u2019s an alcoholic and seeing what it\u2019s done to him.\n\n I need to find someone who understands I smoke way too much weed to consistently drink booze; my stomach is for snacks, first and foremost. Adding a single beer means my snacks spend 14 hours slowly digesting and burning up my throat.",

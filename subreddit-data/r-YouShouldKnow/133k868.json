    "postText": "why ysk: many gum brands contain a sweetener called xylitol which is safe for humans but can be fatal to dogs in small amounts. Our 65 pound doodle might not make it through the night because he ate a pack earlier today. Hoping others can learn from this post instead of the horrible way we did.",

            "comment": "Also, if you discover your dog has gotten into some gum, your very first step should be to call the [Animal Poison Control](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control) line. \n\nThere is a fee since they don't have other funding, but they will walk you through every step of the process. They will know exactly what harmful ingredients are in that specific gum (if any) and will give you specific instructions on what to do next (which may include inducing vomiting).\n\nDo this before going to the emergency vet, or at least call them while you're on the way to the vet. We were told by our emergency vet clinic that the first thing they would do is call this exact number, so doing it yourself will save valuable time.",

I called human poison control, they told me to go to the emergency vet, because I told the emergency vet that \"poison control said she needed her stomach pumped\" that they just did it. Afterwards, the vet came and discussed with me that he was unsure if that was necessary. I don't regret it at all, but animal poison control would have given me a more nuanced answer based on the contents of the glue and the size of my dog. Animal poison control costs something like 50 bucks, whereas I had to pay 300 dollars to get my dog traumatized and tranquilized without even knowing whether it was medically necessary.",

Look up a list of common human food that can be toxic to a dog, so if in the future a pup does eat it you can act accordingly and contact the vet or a pet toxicity hotline immediately. Also keep in mind- the more detail the better. Bring the package with you. Bring a sample with you (in cases of rat poison and similar things). Try to narrow down the exact amout ingested. The more the professionals know, the better, because we calculate the toxicity level by using your petsl's weight and the amount they consumed. And for God's sake don't try to induce vomiting without an input from a professional. Same goes for any homemade remedies, you can do more harm that good.\n\nBest of luck to you and your pup!

Some dogs will eat absolutely anything- sponges, jewelery, bras, kaleidoscopes (these are all actual things I dogs I know have eaten). Gum is not a stretch. \n\nBut some people do brush their dogs teeth, and same advice- do not use xylitol toothpaste!!!",

Things like teaching them not to beg and making sure to keep them on a steady and regular diet of healthy dog food. Obviously you can give them small treats here and there like a small piece of banana or apple. But always ALWAYS check if it is safe first by checking with your vet and consulting multiple sources like reputable books and articles.",

I wish you could trust your vet but far too many tell you incorrect information on what they can eat.\n\nMany vets still tell you dairy is ok when it's very much not. Dogs don't correctly digest dairy. Don't give them cheese or ice cream. They will eat almost anything you offer them thinking they can trust you.\n\nThey can't have anything with garlic and please don't give them fast food burgers and fries. While they can kind of eat it if it's not seasoned, it will cause problems down the line like diabetes, heart conditions, extreme obesity and possibly (but I'm not 100% sure) cancer. These conditions are very difficult for dogs and can kill them years before they would have died.",

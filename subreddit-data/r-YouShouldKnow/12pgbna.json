    "postText": "Why YSK: These fires result from the buildup of static electricity. The insulating effect of the bed liner or carpet prevents the static charge generated by gasoline flowing into the container or other sources from grounding. The discharge of this buildup to the grounded gasoline dispenser nozzle may cause a spark and ignite the gasoline.\n\n[Source from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-111/default.html)",

            "comment": "This is very good advice. People do not realize how flammable petrol is and how often fires start. Canisters should always be filled on the ground. You should always touch direct metal before inserting the nozzle into any tank to eliminated charge build up. You should refrain from entering your car while pumping your gas as it can build up more charge. HEAT of any sort can set off gas and it can literally jump from one source to another. Good advice OP! More people need to know this! (Especially after prices in the states rose and people were filling gas into PLASTIC CONTAINERS! Yes people really are not aware of things like this)",

HDPE (high density polythylene) which is also used on many safety gear like vests, hard hats, fall gear, etc. due to its high impact and chemical resistant properties. But people were filling plastic garbage bags, plastic totes for storage, plastic buckets. Those are commonly made of PVC, acrylic, or regular polythylene. Petroleum will eat right through that.",

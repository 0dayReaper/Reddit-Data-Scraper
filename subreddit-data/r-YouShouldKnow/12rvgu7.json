    "postText": "Why YSK: It's moving season, 80% of US moves occur during the summer. It's very common to be given a low quote for your move and then be charged thousands of dollars more than the original quote. It is also common to have your belongings delayed for months or \"lost\" altogether.\n\nThis problem is particularly rampant when using companies that act as brokers. The broker will offer you a quote but will subcontract your move to a different company and then act helpless when that moving company shows up and says they can't move you for what you the broker quoted you.\n\nThere are many red flags for moving scams\n\n* if you are not provided with a copy of Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move, interstate movers are required to provide this to you\n* no on-site quote, any quote that is given without someone visiting your home is probably inaccurate, even if you provide them the number of rooms in your home or try to make an inventory of your belongings\n* if you are told you have to pay based on space your items take up instead of weight, interstate moving companies are required to charge by weight for interstate moves\n* large down payment, most legitimate companies will only ask for up to 20% down\n* cash only, this is done to avoid a paper trail\n* extremely low rates, if it's too good to be true...\n* no logo on moving trucks, a rolling billboard is perfect advertising while they\u2019re getting paid to move your belongings. If your mover can\u2019t afford a logo and phone number on the side of a moving truck, chances are the business isn\u2019t legitimate.\n* no address or office, investigate your company's provided address to ensure it is a business and not a residence or random address\n* no contract or asks you to sign a blank contract\n* extreme reviews, one of the ways to find out if your mover is legitimate is checking to see if they are a certified ProMover from the American Moving &amp; Storage Association (AMSA).\n* unprofessional phone behavior, beware if they answer the phones by saying \"movers\" or otherwise do not identify themselves\n\nThe easiest way to avoid moving scams is to stick with reputable moving companies and avoid brokers, even if it's more expensive up front.",

                    "comment": "Sister and her husband got quotes from a few companies two years ago to move from Colorado back to Ohio. Most of the quotes required a contract that her husband read very carefully regarding cancellations. They cancelled when they decided to hire one of those cube companies instead because it was significantly cheaper. \n\nEvery company worth their salt accepted their cancellation no questions asked because they did it within the required time frame. All except for one. \n\nThe company called and harassed my BIL every day telling him he owed the full rate. He recorded each conversation and let them know he was doing so. They hung up every time he said that. He then reached out via the number on his contract which was not connecting him with the people who were harassing him, but the original scheduling company. The lady was really nice and said she\u2019d take care of the contractors. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. The people keep calling and harassing him, attempting to provoke him. He calmly responds each time. He learns that CO is one party consent so he stops telling them he\u2019s recording. They get him to utter one swear word - \u201casshole\u201d. They then try to say that they are cancelling their service and he has to pay everything and base it on a really stupid clause their have in their contract. While reading the contract back to him, he reads the wrong business name. \n\nI can\u2019t remember exactly, but I don\u2019t think contractors are allowed to operate under multiple business names or work for multiple service providers. \n\nHe explains that he is done messing around and not going to let them flip the contract around on him. He reminds them of when they booked, when they cancelled, what their contract states and how the dates align and what business name is on his contract. He explains that he has recorded each conversation they\u2019ve had including the final one and he has compiled all the recordings and paperwork. He tells the man that he is submitting the information to the States attorney general and going to review them on every platform he can.  When he threatened the Atty Gen. the guy went quiet and disconnected shortly thereafter. \n\nHe did submit everything he had to the Atty Gen and wrote as many reviews as he could find under the two business names he knew about. Pods moved their belongings East and he and his dad drove their cars while my sister flew with the dog. Super stressful situation, especially with the predatory nature of the contractors, but they\u2019re fine now.",

Ass holes on the phone that were brokers said the move would be 3K. \n\nThe movers come and they put everything in the truck and quote me at 5K. I say hell no! That\u2019s 2K more than expected. \n\nThey don\u2019t care. They say if I have a problem they\u2019re gonna leave my stuff in a warehouse in Nevada while I figure it out. Literally all my stuff was in the truck sans my tooth brush and one change of clothes. \n\nI gave in and agreed to the 5K. Reported to BBB and local police and stuff. No one cared.",

If it's moving day and your lease is up and your mover is like \"oh it's gonna be an extra $6k\" there's nothing you can do. You can't get another mover because they require advanced notice and you can't stay cause your lease is up. The only possible option is get a truck and move all your stuff to a storage site but that's almost never an option for interstate moves and it costs money.",

Kind of like Uhaul without the haul part. I used  U-Pack and enjoyed it.\n\nThey work really well for smaller households cause you only need one or two pods (depending on the company). I don't know how well it scales if you have a large home or family. Although I think they might have larger containers and trucks you can load.

We managed to get pulled over on the interstate.  The engine still ran but the transmission blew, there was fluid spewing all over the place.  It would not drive.\n\nOk, so we call Uhaul.  Yep someone will pick you up, dispatching now.  ETA within 2 hours.\n\n2 hours go by.  We\u2019re running the truck intermittently to run the AC cuz it\u2019s super hot out.  We have no food or water.\n\nCall Uhaul back.  Oh, nobody came?  Ok we\u2019re dispatching someone else.  They\u2019ll be there in 2 hours.\n\nNobody shows up after 2 hours.\n\nCall Uhaul back. Oh, the person who was working with you went home for the day so I don\u2019t know anything about this or what happened, I\u2019ll dispatch someone now.  They should be there in 2 hours.\n\n2 more hours.  At this point I\u2019m sick of hiking over the embankment to find somewhere to pee and we\u2019re so thirsty and hungry.\n\nCall Uhaul back.  Same routine.  \n\nWe call AAA just trying to find someone to help.  They say nobody there has a tow truck that can tow a Uhaul.\n\nCall Uhaul back.  It\u2019s dark.  It\u2019s like 10 pm.  We\u2019re exhausted.  We\u2019re thirsty and hungry.  They have zero clue again because now the second person\u2019s shift is over and they have no idea blah blah blah.  They\u2019ll try to send someone out.\n\nSo after almost 12 hours on the side of a busy highway in MA we called the sheriff.   They had us a tow within 20 minutes and I wept when that guy showed up with his tow truck.  He stopped at a gas station immediately so we could get food and drinks and use the bathroom.\n\nUhaul refused any refunds and we got charged for the extra \u201cmileage\u201d we put on sitting completely still.  We tried a chargeback and it got denied because Uhaul reasoned we still had their truck and we still drove it so we still owed them money and the credit card company sided with them.\n\nInteresting that this parked undriveable Uhaul is still increasing mileage.  It\u2019s just ticking up and up and up even though we\u2019re not moving.  This is the one part of my story I want people to understand.  If the engine was on even when the truck was in park it was adding mileage.\n\nI will never rent Uhaul ever again.  I will sell or throw all my stuff on the curb and buy new things when I arrive before I\u2019d rent a Uhaul again.",

It's definitely more work, and the trucks aren't the most comfortable on long moves, but it saves so much money.\n\nI will say, I'm not super happy with Uhaul's business model of letting you book a truck at one location (5 weeks before the move), but then two days before your move, they contact you to say they're sold out everywhere within 40 miles and make you drive 45 miles to get your truck. Has happened twice now. Will still continue to use them and put up with their inconveniences since they really are the best option.",

Uhaul will rent you the truck and movers, last time I looked, it was around $25 per hour per man.  That sounds expensive but it's way cheaper than a moving company.",

We hired local movers to pack up our breakables, and fill one with all the heavy items, tvs furniture etc. We even moved a motorcycle in the one we filled ourselves. We did a u-haul trailer for anything left over, jewelry, irreplaceables, papers etc. It was a lot of work and to a lot of planning, but we saved thousands and felt way more in control.

Asking the right questions, doing proper research and having general common sense are all key to securing a quality and reputable service. \n\nI will say, from the side of the company, getting every client to agree to do an in-home estimate is a pipe dream. If you cannot provide some people with an over the phone estimate, they will simply move down the Google result list. That said, the company I worked for required in-home estimates for homes greater than a specific sq ft. Providing over the phone/email estimates is by no means an exact science but it takes an honest exchange between client and service provider to get as close to accurate as possible. My particular company used a great software called smartmoving to handle pretty much a-z. It allowed clients to input their inventory themselves which seemed to make it a more accurate list most of the time (aside from the person that thinks if they say they are only moving a bed, a dresser, and a sofa to get a cheap quote. Then you show up and it\u2019s a 3bdrm, fully loaded home. At which point the client is made abundantly clear that the estimate is out of the window and an estimate based on what is present is provided before work begins). The software also allowed us to upload an inventory taken from an in-home estimate and share it with the client for them to confirm/edit. All payment and documentation was handled within the software as well. \n\nThe moving industry can be a tricky situation that shouldn\u2019t be. Shady and dishonest companies make life incredibly hard for those attempting to break the stigma that surrounds the industry. There are companies that 100% care about your home and your belongings, that are honest and provide an excellent service. Our particular market has 100\u2019s of companies and throughout my years in the industry and networking with other companies, I would recommend less than 10 to my mother. Obviously, I can\u2019t speak for every company, only those I interacted with.",

Plus international but that's a whole other bag.\nLocal moves, usually under 40 miles but it differs by state, and these are generally unregulated in terms of prices. \nIntrastate: longer moves but staying within the confines of a single state, each state has its own intrastate tariff which sets the prices you are charged. \nInterstate: any move that crosses state lines. Will follow interstate pricing tariffs, typically only ever charges a rate of x dollars per 100lbs of weight, then adding additional services on top such as needing a shuttle to get things from the truck to the door or door to truck (if you have a long narrow driveway a truck can't fit into or a lot of apartment complexes can't accommodate a full moving truck in the parking lot so they park nearby and use a shuttle truck) additional man power if you have large or heavy items, storage costs, boxes and more.\n\nI used to rate and bill moves for a moving company lol",

When they opened the truck, everything was crammed in up to the top and one of the movers said \"So what are you ok with being broken?\" It was such bullshit. They ended up breaking both of our dressers, a lamp, and a bedframe. And somehow my wardrobe boxes (with my wedding dress inside) went missing. 2 months later, FedEx delivered them to our house (had no idea they had been located) and they were half crushed. From other stories I've heard, we got off easy. They just don't care about your belongings. I feel like it might even be fun for them to just toss shit around and break furniture without being fired for it. Idk why the standards get to be so low for military movers.",

(also, before he arrived for our appointment he asked me several times over text message to confirm the price range of the move.. wtf?). His quote was for $15k, plus about $1.5k per vehicle. He also offered to give us a United Van Lines quote, which was confusing. ..  apparently Mayflower and UVL are both owned by a company called Unity (and they even share near identical websites).\n\nMy question is are there any risks here with these middlemen or is this pretty normal.\n\nThis is all pretty confusing TBH...",

To go by the law and charge by weight, there is the allowance of approx. 6.5 lb per cubic feet. So if your stuff is 1,000 cuft, you'll be charged for 6,500 lb. No company will EVER weight your stuff, unless you have some extremely heavy items.\n\n\n**If you want to make sure that the company you chose is reputable, look at their accreditations. All moving companies would have in their email signatures or website what they're a member of. Look for FIDI (basically highest standards on the market). They might charge a bit but they're good at what they do. Alternatively, look if they're members of IAM. Not as high standards as FIDI, but it will tell you they're legit.**\n\n*edit: formatting*",

If they provide you with a non-binding estimate (which is most common) they are required to weigh your shipment to determine final cost and you have a right to be present. If they provide you with a binding estimate that does not apply. An additional form of fraud is first providing you with a non binding estimate and then making you sign a binding estimate the day of in order to get around this requirement.",

Moving is a huge pain and hassle even under pretty much the best of circumstances and as much as you can cut down on what you need to transport the better off you are. Yea you\u2019ll have to replace it at the new location but if you do a thorough ROI you\u2019ll often find that is cheaper than hauling a bunch of stuff that isn\u2019t worth it. My $.02",

Definitely try to book directly with a mover instead of a broker, and check their rating with better business bureau. Everything OP said is accurate except it is actually legal for them to charge by volume instead of weight. This is allowed but is super shady practice because the DOT will not confirm volume. DOT will confirm weight at a weigh station and you have the right to request a re-weigh upon delivery at a DOT station while you watch to ensure no funny business. You have no recourse if they overcharge you by volume. Also, they\u2019ll try to get you to waive your right to insure the value of your goods to some trivial legal minimum that will pay you out like $20 if they take all your valuables. Don\u2019t do it! They are required to offer an insurance that fully covers valuables \u2014 look up the know your moving rights pamphlet online to confirm your insurance options. And the movers do have to provide this pamphlet on pickup\u2014 ask for it if they don\u2019t offer and review everything to make sure they don\u2019t fleece you!",

My wife and I had our house cleared out and stored during a big reno, and when we got it back every single piece of furniture was damaged. I\u2019m talking our $5k brand new bedroom set had massive spots where the straps vibrated the wood, every chair and our dining room table were scratched and chipped. I brought I up as they were bringing it all back inside so they couldn\u2019t deny anything, spoke to managers, their only \u2018offer\u2019 to make it right was to take it all back and let their \u2018guy\u2019 touch up all the spots to make them less visible. We let them take the chairs but needed our bedroom furniture. More arguing, then denying,  and I think we ended up getting like $250 back from what I think was a $1200 job. lesson learned.",

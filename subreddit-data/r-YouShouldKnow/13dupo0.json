    "postText": "Why YSK: SDC markets themselves as the cheap alternative to teeth straightening by plastic aligners, but in the long run you will pay more and get less\n\nFor starters, when you purchase the program, they do not include your final set of aligners. Instead, as you start wearing your final set, they email/text you that you need to order a set of retainers for $100 that will serve as your final aligner.\n\nTheir \"Lifetime Smile Guarantee\" hinges on your purchasing a new set of retainers every 6 months, at $100/ea. Though they often have sales of \"buy 2 get 1 free\" (3 for $200), you'll be paying somewhere between $200/yr or $400/3yr. They're effectively a subscription service.\n\nFurthermore, if you go too long between ordering retainers, they will delete your record. If you want a new retainer at that point, you have to take a new imprint and pay $30, on top of the $100 for the retainer. And if your teeth have shifted from where they were at the end of your treatment, you will only be able to get retainers for where they've shifted to, unless you shell out another $250 for a gap correction.\n\nSecondly, the shape of their aligners leave a lot of sharp edges in your mouth. Their competitor's aligners end on the teeth, whereas SDC's extend to the gums, and the sharp edges are abrasive against the inside of your cheeks and your tongue as you talk. I personally had to employ the use of fine fingernail scissors for every aligner I used just to limit tearing up the inside of my mouth.\n\nThirdly, SDC never gives you direct access to your orthodontist. What this means is there is no consultation on exactly what can be done. They find the shortest path to giving you straight teeth and offer no other corrections, such as bite gaps, cross-bites, etc. For example, their program left the bite of my back teeth wavy, not straight (i.e. my top teeth were convexly aligned and my bottom concavely)\n\nAs a person who did SDC first and am now using their competitor, I wish I had just gone with their competitor in the first place. Though the upfront cost of their competitor is significantly higher, over the course of my lifetime, SDC would have ultimately ended up costing me a lot more if I'd maintained their 6mo retainer purchase requirement at $133-200/yr for the rest of my life. Their competitor's retainers last a lot longer, are a lot more comfortable, and don't require repurchase until you actually need them. Furthermore, they never delete your records in order to squeeze more money out of you.",

            "comment": "There is one extremely important aspect of online teeth alignment service that needs to be discussed before EVER considering using these options instead of invisalign: \n\nNONE of these companies can raise or lower your teeth to \"level\" them flush like invisalign can. There is a reason invisalign sometimes requires \"buttons\" to be placed on your teeth: to pull them up or down to make them level with one another and increase that smile factor. Obviously, you can not have these buttons placed on your teeth if you've purchased these online aligners.\n\njfyi",

My invisalign is through Smile Doctors which is the name of the app. It also has all sorts of cool features since you scan once a week you can see your progress in a few different time lapses (side by side, scrub from beginning to current, etc\u2026) my favorite thing to do is scrub really fast from beginning to end because the app uses AI or something from all the scans to form it into a video and you watch your teeth slowly move and straighten then you can scrub back and forth to when they were all crooked in the beginning lol it\u2019s cool as shit",

I know a couple people that have gone down the path of really getting sick of them a few months in, wearing them less and less. Eventually you get to a point where youd have to start from scratch again and get a whole new assessment/set to get you back on track to your existing plan. It can drag on for extra YEARS.

It's a thin piece of metal bonded to the back of my lower teeth. I think I'm a good candidate for this because the overlapping teeth were the lower front teeth while my upper teeth have always appeared fine. My fixed lower teeth should keep my upper teeth generally well shaped.\n\nI have a retainer for the upper teeth, but haven't worn it. My dentist said one tooth could turn ever so slightly, but I'm like, \"I'm not looking for perfect teeth, just no overlapping teeth.\"",

They will also rescan my teeth halfway through my treatment and adjust my prescription as needed.

All teeth straightening programs will now require retainers worn indefinitely. \n\nThe difference is that Invisalign\u2019s last a lot longer than 6 months(as do SDC\u2019s, despite them requiring you repurchase that often).\n\nFrom what I found(IIRC), Invisalign\u2019s retainers are a few hundred a piece, but they can supposedly last upwards of 10 years, but about 5 is to be expected. I believe the retainer sets were maybe $300. So less than $100/yr vs $133-200/yr, where prices currently stand(and I\u2019d expect SDC\u2019s to go up at a faster pace than inflation), is how you\u2019d need to do the math.\n\nBut even if it ended up that they were the same price in the end, Invisalign is a far superior product and experience. And as others have noted in the comments, SDC can apparently even cause major damage to your teeth/jaw.\n\nMy main point to this post was to say that even if you\u2019re willing to take the hit on perfection to save some money, unless you\u2019re straightening your teeth for a one time thing(like wedding photos or whatever), you\u2019re not even going to save money, and may ultimately end up spending a lot more over the course of decades",

But it came with seeing my ortho regularly, having my record retained indefinitely, and 4 sets of retainers.\n\nIf these 4 sets of retainers last me even 3 years apiece, that\u2019s $5200 for 13 years, including the program. If I\u2019d played by SDC\u2019s rules, 13 years would\u2019ve cost me between $2800 and $3900. And with SDC, every decade is $1333-$2000\n\nSo even at 20 years, assuming retainer replacement every 6 months with SDC, Invisalign is the cheaper option",

Aligners also arrived very late meaning they didn't have the capitol or production knowledge to scale to their business.

Repeatedly hitting the same spots over and over, because they would stay swollen and inflamed. I was biting until I bled with at least one meal a day. I found out that repeated soft tissue trauma increases the likelihood of developing various types of oral cancer!\n\nI didn\u2019t know about the recurring charges and ended up having to work with my bank to reverse charges I didn\u2019t authorize and eventually cancel the SDC account. \n\nThe retainers were SO poorly made, but I didn\u2019t realize it could be better and not have it cutting into my gums every two weeks. They were also lower quality - I bit through the final retainers three times (paid for a new set every time). \n\nI never ONCE - not an exaggeration, it never happened - had a check in with my orthodontist. \n\nI finished SDC in 2019 and my teeth started shifting immediately. I am now on week 6 of Invisalign. \n\nSDC - $1800\nInvisalign - $4900 but insurance paid $2000 (switched jobs and now have once per lifetime orthodontic benefit thankfully) \n\nSDC was not worth it.

Not once did an orthodontist check on my progress. The aligners are painful, more it should be.  They are not supposed to be pleasant but it felt like someone was stabbing my gums with little needles for 20 hrs a day. There are too many sharp edges. \nWhen my set did not come in time, they had the balls to blame me and tell me I'm on the hook to pay for replacements.   When I asked them where is their proof that it got to my doorstep they gave me a tracking nunber that says that they shipped it out but there is no status that it was delivered for over 2 weeks. \n\nAbout 4 to 5 months before my treatment was complete I didn't feel the aligners were doing what they were supposed to. There were some gaps their computerized model didn't take into account.  Even when I complained they emailed back with a \"use your current set for longer and contact us again later\" \n\nI found it comical why they keep sending me emails on how I'm doing, saying that they keep a journal of your progress, but they never respond back when i do have issues.\n\nThe final treatment I didn't see the results I wanted and I was unhappy. Radio silence from them. About a year later I went to a competitor and I had waaay better results. Sure it costs more, but I had regular ortho checkups to make sure things are progressing well, the aligners don't feel like I'm putting little knives in-between my teeth and gums. \n\nTdlr: you get what you pay for in product and (lack of) service .",

We don\u2019t even do ortho at our office, but we get a lot of people who have done SDC or similar ones, and the results are not worth it. He\u2019s even tried to contact them to see if there was an orthodontist he could speak to regarding one of our patients, they couldn\u2019t get an orthodontist to speak with him. Very shady. He says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they start getting hit with lawsuits soon. \n\nThere\u2019s so much that goes into straightening teeth, I\u2019m currently on Invisalign, and I see my orthodontist every 8 weeks to make sure that my teeth are tracking with every aligner and making sure everything is moving the way it needs to be. I\u2019ve even had to get new scans done (at no cost) halfway through because some teeth were \u201cfalling behind\u201d in terms of how they should move. You can\u2019t get that type of monitoring with online ortho.",

The first one, definitely not great.  The second one: better and probably good enough. The third one: perfection, my orthodontist would have been proud of me for sure. \n\nI send out my impressions, excited to try braces again and happy because it seemed affordable. A couple weeks pass and I get an email saying my impressions are no good. No description as to what I did wrong or what they were looking for, but don't worry, I can buy another impression kit for just 20 bucks!  \n\nI read the email and instantly felt duped. It's goop and some plastic, it's not that expensive. They're making good money off the initial impression kits and skimming a little more off top by getting you to buy at least one more, because of sunk cost fallacy a lot of people will probably buy it.

Try again!)\n\nI did not get the second kit, if they can't tell me what I did wrong the first time, how many do overs will they rope me into?

My fiancee (now wife) used smile direct club and got to the 2nd last batch of aligners and they were moulded wrong and there was no way they could fit. Like it was so misshapen it wasn't even normal shaped. So she got onto support and they sent her into the city to get another scan done which she did the next day and they told her to keep wearing the last week's aligners until a new one turned up. 3 weeks later that one broke so back to support who said a new one should only be a week away. 2 weeks after that the new one turned up and it was misshapen the exact same way as the original. So back onto support and they had to \"escalate\" the case. 3 weeks later and we had heard nothing so we started contacting everyone at smile direct we could until finally someone told us \"there were no impressions on file\" so she could go get more scans done at her cost and to keep wearing the broken aligner. By this point we had had enough and after a lot of hassle we got a refund for the whole amount, only because of our countries consumer protection ombudsman (australia). At first they wanted to refund the cost of the outstanding aligners that they hadn't shipped only. \n\nThen we made the decision to go see a local dentist who got aligners made up locally and she visits every 2 weeks for an inspection to see if things need to change and actually files the teeth (which when moving them really needs to be done). And the cost wasn't that much more than smile direct club. \n\nI warn anybody I can against smile direct club. They are the worst company I think I have ever dealt with.",

I don't even want money back or anything,  I just want someone to apologize for the horrible way they treat people. \n\nI don't know if Invisalign is better,  but I would rather have started with an orthodontist again rather than be treated as horribly as I have. Just FWIW I had real braces for 4 years as a kid/teen but my wisdom teeth came in and jacked everything up.",

It\u2019s usually a general dentist, somewhere in the country, only looking for VERY visible decay. Once you\u2019re \u201capproved\u201d (and some people really should not be), the software figures out your plan. The dentist never looks at it again. It is a GIANT red flag that not a single X-ray is taken or looked at prior to treatment. I can\u2019t tell you how many people come into my office, teeth jacked, roots incredibly short, teeth are in jeopardy, bite is wrong and causing trauma, and say \u201cso I did smile direct/bite/insert other option here\u201d. Like ya, I can see that.",

The cost would have been a fraction of the cost of invisalign. After taking my scan, they came back and told be they woul don't even attempt to correct my bottom teeth. They were too crooked. But they wanted me to move forward with aligners for NY top teeth only. \n\nI then visited my local orthodontist who is an invisalign provider, and pulled the trigger. The cost is much higher, but I am happy so far. I have a professional staff 5 minutes away who I can call or visit in person. I have a long way to go, but I can see and feel a difference already after about 6 weeks.",

I actually tell my patients that Invisalign is 'orthodontics for dummies.'  If it is a difficult case, i refer to a specialist.   How do u decide if it's a difficult case?  let's find a couple hours free and I will try to tell you....\n\nOrthodontists have years of training beyond what I have.  I have years of training beyond what any 'do it yourself' orthodontic patient would have.\n\nFolks who use these services might be ok... some of the time... but might cause themselves irreparable harm other times.  Would you try to do all of your own plumbing? or electrical wiring? who has the longest training: plumber, electrician or orthodontist?",

Go to an actual orthodontist and make sure your teeth don't need extra procedures, just because they're crooked doesn't mean they only need to be aligned with plastic sometimes you need more indepth procedures that no online company can offer.",

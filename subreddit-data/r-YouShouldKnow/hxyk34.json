    "postText": "When I bought my home 8 years ago, the prior owner made a big deal of showing me the water cut-off.  It is in a closet.  Today a pipe burst under my sink, and tons of water starting pouring everywhere.  Luckily, I remembered where the cutoff was, and I killed the water to the whole house.  Zero damage.  Just a big mess to cleanup.   If I didn't know where that cutoff dial was, it would have been thousands of dollars of damage.\n\nEdit: typo",

Indoor plumbing was actually one of the great innovations that allowed civilization to flourish, bringing safe water to a person\u2019s home without the need for travel, and safely removing waste. Plumbers are actually an integral part of a nation\u2019s public health.\n\nHowever, yes, technically you could turn a water heater or a boiler into an explosive device with improper maintenance. Improperly serviced water fixtures, sinks and toilets and such, can lead to structural damage of a home. Improperly built or maintained sewers can allow toxic gas to seep into a home.\n\nThis is why you pay for expertise. I spent a few years as an apprentice plumber and I can fix most things around my home but there\u2019s still some things I\u2019m gonna call a licensed professional for.\n\nAnd on that note: I don\u2019t like most \u201chandy-men\u201d or general contractors.",

I get up at like 4am to piss and get a drink.  As I walk into the kitchen I notice the floor is shiny.  Then I realize it's water.  Where's it coming from?  Can't figure it out but run to the basement to shut off the main.\n\nI jump the last step into the basement and splash into a puddle of about an inch of water.  I manage to shut off the main and then hunt for the culprit.  Pin hole crack in the refrigerator water line.  Probably had only been leaking for 4-5 hours since we went to bed at 11pm and it wasn't leaking then.\n\nShopvac all the water up upstairs first, wasn't too bad.  Thankfully our basement floor was less uneven than we though and even though there was an inch of water it was only about 10 feet in diameter so upon inspection nothing looked to be damaged.  The house was old so it had really good thick wood for floor joists and they were just surface wet.\n\nFigured we got away clean.  But 2 weeks later it got colder out and we had to turn the heat back on.  Found out the water dripped on the furnace and ruined it.  But that's why you have homeowners insurance.",

Panels for dwelling units (residential homes) are to have clearance 6' 6\" in height, 2' 6\" in width (unless your panel is wider then it's the panel width), and extends out a minimum of 3' (based on typical house panel). This is in ... Article 110.26 Spaces About Electrical Equipment. So no burying your panel behind boxes of things that you never use.\n\nAlso in Article 210 Branch Circuits ... It says that fault current interrupting devices (fuses and circuit breakers) shall be readily accessable. Meaning that they are required to be able to be accessed without the use of any tools or keys. In layman's terms ... You need to be able to open your panel's front cover door and shut off power in case of an emergency without effort.\n\nAs a commercial electrician I can tell you that insurance companies look for any reason to deny a claim and failure to follow regulations are an easy method that they do it. They have people in the claims department that specialize in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, building codes ... Etc just so they know what to cite and how to deny claims.",

If you flush twice and see the overflow imminent, your only hope is to quickly open the tank and physically push the flapper back down. You will likely fail - but it is the only hope for the poor souls that try to keep flushing.",

The quickest way to stop the water from flooding the neighbor's basement was a wrench at the meter.  (I just alerted the neighbor while walking by.  I had to walk my dog, so I couldn't stay to see if they turned it off themselves or called the water company.)",

Most shutoffs are on the street side, where the water line comes off the main and meter, but it could be to the side. Some more common places to look: under a bathroom sink or kitchen sink, in a closet, in the laundry room possibly behind the washer and dryer, or under the laundry sink. It may be behind a panel. Near the water heater. Also check the garage. If you have an outside hose bibb, it might be near that, but inside the garage. I\u2019ve found shutoff in all kinds of places. The OP is correct, you should locate and make sure the valve is readily accessible.",

Also drain the heating system.\n\nWhat I'm told: leave pipes connected to mains water supply and keep all the taps turned off.\n\nWhy is the second option better? It doesn't seem like any water would move either way, but the first option has less water and more room for it to expand, no? Lots of pipes in the house and subzero temperatures will surely freeze something, right?",

I was an hour and a half away by car and had to walk her through shutting the main line off while our water heater dumped water into our home. Thank God she is a strong willed woman. We now regularly remind each other where it is and quiz each other on other important facts about home maintenance and upkeep stuff. Nothing like hearing your wife say I noticed the gutter guards were broken babe .I used the last of the extras to replace it and got another sleeve from Home Depot and it's in the shed.  Great tip friend.",

I now shut off the main line to the house when I leave for extended periods, and make sure to turn down the hot water heater. \n\nAlso know where the shutoffs are in each bathroom. Great way to save it from flooding when the toilet starts overflowing.",

            "comment": "When I brought my current house I started on my first project, the downstairs half bath. I had to shut off the water to the whole house, which I knew where it was, but it was an old gate valve and it broke in the closed position... Late on Sunday evening. No water to house.... \n\nI got to a nearby ace and swapped the old valve for a 1/4 turn ball valve. (and if yours isn't a ball valve, it really should be!)\n\nFast forward to the next weekend, I am finishing the project. Got the sink reinstalled. It's again late on Sunday, about 9 at night, dark outside.\n\nI turn the water back on at the sink itself and that old valve shattered.... The handle flew off, hit me in the chest followed by hot water spewing everywhere....\n\n\nI ran outside and to the crawl space (which you can stand in. So stand space?) I had no flashlight. No automatic lights. Decided to skip looking for the light pull cord and just feel for the valve.\n\nFortunately I knew pretty much exactly where it was, even in pitch black. And since it was a new 1/4 turn, as soon as I felt that lever hit my fingers, the water was off.\n\n\nSo long story short. OP is right. Know where the water shut off is.",

If there isn\u2019t one at all you would have to shut it off at the meter, which is sometimes very difficult to find. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing plumbing for a long time and there have been days where I\u2019d spend an hour or two digging around in the yard trying to find a meter that\u2019s been buried, covered with mulch, or grown over with vegetation. You do not want to be searching for a meter box when your house is flooding. \n\nIf you do not have an indoor shut off consider having one installed. It\u2019s typically a pretty simple job and the plumber can just tuck it in the corner of a closet somewhere.",

Also take an hour (if even that) find your water heater, look at the lines (copper/galvanized steel/PEX depending on when it was built) if you\u2019re lines were run by a computable human. Every single room with multiple fixtures (kitchens/bathrooms/ laundry rooms) should at least have their own valve, if not one for each line individual line of hot and cold. A lot of work goes into getting your home fitted with basic plumbing these days. And then benefit in incredible. We aren\u2019t dying from the Black Plague anymore!!!\n\nBut I know plumbers get a lot thrown at them and I\u2019ve seen many a seasoned master, have to run a sewer line (6in PVC, down and 8th trench from the sewer hookup to the house) all day and then do a shit job on a simple shower diverter. And once it\u2019s hidden behind insulation  and drywall or tile, you\u2019re not gonna know you have a problem until it\u2019s a really bad problem. \n\nIndoor plumbing is the only reason we can wash our hands and shit and not live like fucking savages. Pls give it the respect it deserves. its saved more human lives than modern medicine has.",

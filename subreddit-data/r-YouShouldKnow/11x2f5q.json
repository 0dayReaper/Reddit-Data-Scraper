I wish we paid servers a livable wage without tipping, but we don\u2019t, so since I can afford to do extra, I will. The tipping rules are arbitrary anyway.",

This should just be common knowledge then. The hostility implies that I'm revealing some \"dirty trade secret that servers don't want you to know\". If you choose to tip post tax that's your choice and there's nothing wrong with it. The point of the post is to point out that if you choose to tip before tax, you are still tipping 20%. There is also nothing wrong with that either.\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to add that the POS systems that include the tip at the bottom do not include tax in the tip. Because you're aware of this I'm not sure why you're implying I'm nickel and diming the server but these systems are not. The reality is this is just the way the tipping system is structured.",

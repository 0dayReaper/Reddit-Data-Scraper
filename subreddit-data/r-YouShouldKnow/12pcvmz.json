    "postText": "Why YSK:  This is to ensure the safety of all the people in the airport.\n\nThe laptop is dense enough that X-rays cant see through it. Thus, it can be used to conceal other items that are not allowed.\n\nWhen the laptop goes through the scanners, airport staff cant see if it contains anything prohibited. If your laptop has gone through the scanners or under the electronic device in your bag, it is almost impossible to detect a hidden threat.\n\nSome airports will even require you to remove iPads and tablets from your bags, although they are not as dense as laptops.\n\nOn the subject of turning on your laptop and other gadget:\n\nThe logic is this: if the device is not working, there may be something illegal inside it. That is, the phone or tablet is used as a container for illegal transportation of something. And if the gadget or laptop turns on without a problem, then all is well. However, what to do if the laptop battery is just dead and there is no way to turn it on? The only thing which will help is the charger.\n\nBe sure to take it with you. If you do not manage to turn on your laptop at the request of airport security you may lose time for an additional and more thorough inspection.",

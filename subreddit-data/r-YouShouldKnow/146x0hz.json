You only use an apostrophe when you\u2019re omitting the first two digits: \u201890s, not 90\u2019s or \u201890\u2019s.\n\nWhy YSK: It\u2019s an incredibly common error and can detract from academic writing as it is factually incorrect punctuation.\n\n**EDIT:** Since trolls and contrarians have decided to bombard this thread with mental gymnastics about things they have no understanding of, I will be disabling notifications and discontinuing responses.

A lot of people around the world have gotten by with speaking, but probably never written anything, like... ever.

I'm sure there is one, just can't remember it right now.",

It is possible to write a sentence that requires an apostrophe, but since you're talking about multiple years, it would go *after* the s, as a plural. \"The 90s' optimism was destroyed by 9/11.\" I think most editors would still encourage you to rewrite the sentence, but it's technically correct with the apostrophe after the s.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: I lost my only key few years ago, 2 miles away from my house, and I had to tow my car home and paid $300 the next day for a new key. If I had an extra key, a new copy would only be $100 I won't need a tow. \n\nDon't wait for it to happen, get that extra key, and of course that key will be at home in a safe place.\n\nEdit: Some people don't understand when I'm talking about making a copy of a key, I meant this: get a blank key fob online or eBay and get it program by a locksmith. I bought one from eBay and programmed it myself, then got it cut at Ace Hardware. All in for $120.",

No key, toyota charges 375-425, locksmith came out to me, fob(his fob) reprogramming (without a secondary key) and laser cutting a key to fit in the fob, 150-175 from the locksmith",

Most transponder keys are either $45 or $100 and will gain entry to the vehicle and start it, which is really all you need. Fobiks, fobs, and any kind of proximity remote will all be much more expensive, typically from $150-$300+. In most instances all you\u2019re paying that extra money for is the convenience of opening your door from 50 feet away.\n\nSupport your locally owned Ace and save yourself a headache for expensive keys or locksmith service down the road!",

When my wife travels and takes my car, I make sure she takes both key fobs. I remind her to take one out of her purse and leave it at the house as a back up. If you go hiking on a trail and you lose your key, it is going to suck to get back to the house to get that other key but that will suck less than having to go get a key made. \nDepending on the type of key you have, some people are comfortable, leaving one in a magnetic box under their car. I am not that trusting. When I go out hiking, or some thing, my key is attached to my pants with a carabiner. The only way I am losing that key is if I lose my pants and if I lose my pants, I\u2019ve got bigger problems than my car key.",

Then the dealership tells me they need to \"program a new key\" when it doesn't have any chip in it or any conceivable way to program anything considering there is no chip.  Eventually, we just gave up, and I'll need to swap the ignition if we lose the key.",

All I had to do was turn the key in the ignition like ten times and then press the unlock button and a couple other really silly little steps and then press a button on the fob and voila. Two working fobs for $13 when the dealership told me it would be $270 for a fob and to program it.    I have a 10 year old car though.  Newer cars probably aren\u2019t compatible with the generic fobs from Amazon tho.",

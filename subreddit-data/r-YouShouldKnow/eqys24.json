Lots of decimal points.\n\nhttps://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities\n\nBut really it depends on other factors as well. Falcons would be better for higher density payloads. For example 22.8 ton of water wouldn't fit in the payload bay. If you want to go farther, like to Mars, you have only about a quarter tha payload mass. If you want to launch ultralight payloads you'd need to find enough friends to share a payload bay with you.\n\nOr you could use a different rocket, like an Electron and pay $6M for 150kg. So $1800 per pound?\n\n&gt;Electron is designed to launch a 150 to 225\u00a0kg (330 to 495\u00a0lb) payload to a 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(rocket)",

The US in particular had massive, unused capacity for production due to the great depression shuttering facilities. That isn't the case today. \n\nIn addition you almost couldn't buy a new card from '42 to '45. Or many other goods that required rationed materials. This works for a while, but eventually people want every day things.\n\nSwitching back to a consumer economy isn't fast and free either. War rationing lasted until the 50s in some countries.",

Either way it wasn't expressed as literal.\n\nIf it wasn't love, but a cheese sandwich that motivated them, it'd still be the same. \"One could say that the cheese sandwich is like a powerful force.\" It doesn't really matter what it was. All they could do was point to a motivator (love), and they didn't try to actually explain the crazy shit simply because they couldn't understand it.\n\nIt was worth expressing gratitude for, and it was *as if* love was a transcendental force, merely because it played a role in the crazy shit they encountered. Metaphorically one can relate it to natural forces like gravity, due to the cause and effect it has in our lives, world, and universe.\n\nI found it pleasantly visceral. I didn't want there to be some kind of crazy and hackneyed explanation. I wanted them to not know wtf happened, and to only point to something overt in attempt to make some sort of sense of their experience. That's exactly what we got. But somehow a lot of people missed that and got confused.\n\nI think it's as simple as many people just weren't paying attention. Or they saw it tripping balls and just got deluded. Either way, the criticism you point out is easy to rebut as invalid.",

I spent ten years writing novels and short stories, but was never able to sell anything.\n\nI think what I learned from this experience was that there are many motivations for writing science fiction, and the vast majority of them mean you secretly want to be doing something else...that's probably impractical for you do. In my case, I wanted to visit alien worlds and interact with strange futuristic technology. The only problem was that I didn't really care enough about my potential readers to give them a worthwhile story based on this.\n\nI believe now that if you really want people to read your work, you need to give them something of value in your stories, rather than simply engage in public roleplaying or wish fulfillment. That \"something of value\" can be anything, but it has to come from some important part of you that may be very difficult or even painful to access.\n\nWhich is not to say that it's impossible to sell superficial stories. I read them all the time. But that just means everyone grinds out these things constantly, and if an editor needs something along those lines, they have plenty of choice. But the odds of a sale are very poor for individual writers.",

For example, in Star Trek, the technology that blows our minds like Warp Drives, Phasers, Hypo-Sprays, Teleports, Replicators, etc. aren\u2019t really focused on too much by the characters in the story because those technologies are so ubiquitous in their world that they just never really think about it, just like we do with smart phones, voice controlled AI assistants, the internet, etc.\n\nThat idea really stuck with me, and now, even though I think a lot about the cool technologies we could have in the future, I try not to focus on it too much in my stories because the characters in those stories usually don\u2019t give them any thought.",

Tachyons, if existing, could not be used to transport information. Light speed is the speed of causality and the possibility of faster speed adds the possibility of time travel into the past. Even below but near light speed there would be changes to space and time to consider. Cosmic background radiation would also be experienced quite differently. Black holes do not exist within Newtonian gravity and the effects near them cannot be described using the classical three dimensional space with a time parameter.",

They clearly made an impression, too.  This guy's an SF buff.\n\nSo how does he respond?  He distills each work into a paragraph-long diatribe about scientific inaccuracy.\n\nScience fiction, to be compelling to human readers, has first to be fiction.  Literature serves functions other than scientific accuracy and sometimes must subordinate it to those functions.  This kind of criticism misses that point entirely; and its existence helps foster the ability of narrow-thinking, past-focused literature critics to dismiss all SF out of hand.  The best literature - of any genre - helps us imagine a human context by telling us a story.  SF takes on the responsibility of imagining a human future context; *that does not mean it serves the function of a science textbook.*",

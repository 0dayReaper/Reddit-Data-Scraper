    "postText": "This has happened way too many times at our local wildlife rescue. People find baby deer or rabbits with no parents nearby and think they're abandoned, so they bring them in to try to \"save them\". In reality they're just forcibly separating the animal from its mother and greatly reducing its survival chances.\n\nInfant rabbits without their mothers don't do well. Even in professional care settings, they have about a 90% mortality rate. Taking them away from the nest should be a last resort, only when death is guarenteed otherwise.\n\nEdit: Also, PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO TAKE CARE OF A WILD ANIMAL BY YOURSELF! Baby wildlife relies on species-specific milk from its mom, it will usually starve if you don't know what you're doing. We have to keep 4-5 differently mixed formulas to make sure every species is getting fed what it needs. If you keep it for more than a few days, it will become accustomed to humans and that will DESTROY its survival chances. Also, with many animals, it's often illegal! Please call your local wildlife center (or any, really) if you're considering saving a baby animal and double check with them.",

That they're animals makes some scenes uncomfortable to watch. \n\nBut overall it is really interesting if just because, aside from the love triangle, the show presents a society where you have two very distinct classes of people in predator and prey and the only thing holding it together is people going to great lengths to ensure prey aren't dominated and killed by predators and prey going to great lengths not to demonize predators who they have great tension with.\n\nThe show is paced incredibly well too. Tons and tons of stories are \"furry\" stories and incredibly good or well made. Animal Farm is on that spectrum. Any fable we tell children. It's stupid to throw stories away for having anthropomorphic animals in them because we've been making good stories like that for as long as humans have existed.",

The thinking is 'better I get a meal and make more babies than that scary predator does' \n\nBabies are best handled briefly only when needed for their health checks or if one isn't being cared for properly. Ideally with mom suitably distracted/some distance away. \n\nI'm not an expert so I don't know when and how to gradually tame the babies but I'm sure someone online knows.",

If you know a pet store that sells feeder rats, they are the same kind of rats as you buy as pets but usually less expensive, and you get to save a rat from being eaten by a snake.  I bought several for $5 each.",

Some moms would let us hold them, some wouldnt. We usually just took the mom and put her in a large exercise pen separately so we could clean up the cage and check out the babies.",

He got used to all the sounds of our house and bonded with the people in it.  He was handled daily by myself and the kids. He comes when he is called and has his morning routine with each of my kids and one of the dogs. He has to greet all of them and then takes his morning run through the gated off hallway while he plays with whatever cardboard and paper contraption my ten year old has made for him. He usually ends up snuggled up with a kid while they read when he is done with his run.  I don\u2019t think we will ever get another bunny unless it is handled the way your mom took care of her tiny ones.",

Looked for any sign of mama bunny and found an adult cottontail dead behind my shed. Looks like it's been dead for a couple of days and it's a female. Poor baby bunnies got no more mama.\n\nPut some gloves on, put the babies in a shoebox, drove 1.5 hours to a wildlife rehab where people surrender wildlife they find. Explained the situation to the receptionist, told them the babies probably haven't had food for days.\n\nVet checked them out, told me the dead rabbit is probably not the mother because the babies are all fully fed. She explained that moms leave for the day, comes back, and sits on top of the burrow while the babies feed. She said the babies I took are too young and would need their mother to survive so I should probably put them back asap. \n\nDrove home and put them back in the burrow. Checked on them everyday until they left my yard.",

I let it go and much to my joyful surprise, they don't go much further than a mile from their place of release, so we had several generations of bunnies with the same diamond smudge in the middle of their forehead and short ears!",

They left the nest but They do not know how to fly yet. Mom and dad are watching them and feeding them while they learn to fly and navigate. Never pick up a baby bird unless it is visibly injured. Their movements can be pretty sporadic and awkward so just because they move weird does not mean that they are injured. If they are visibly injured or the parents are confirmed to be dead, you may take the bird and keep it in a dark and comfortable box. Take it to a wildlife rehab center as soon as possible. The sooner the better because they can become quite weak without food quick because they are growing so quickly. If you come across a tiny pink nestling out of the nest, the best course of action is to put it back, mom will not care. If it is injured, there is no nest, or the parents are confirmed to be dead, take it to a rehab center.\n\nKidnapped fledglings happen en masse every spring/summer is a massive drain on wildlife rehab centers, materials and labor wise. They really have no choice but to take a bird in once it has been taken from the wild, so think carefully before you do anything. Fledglings also have a much higher survival rate with their parents than in captivity because birds are made to raise baby birds, humans aren't.",

The time period between getting kicked out of the nest and learning how to fly often resembles a chick in need. At this stage in the birds lives they are actually called a fledgling.",

            "comment": "I worked at a campground when I was 17, and the campground owners had their live-in trailer next to the convenience store/office I worked in. They had a cat named Diesel.\n\nDiesel was a good cat, caught rats and mice in the barn and kept the campground free of pests and would generally leave the bunnies alone... except one time.\n\nI was taking a break and hanging out on the deck beside the owners trailer. Diesel came over and as I leaned to pet him, he dropped what I thought was a hair ball on the concrete. \n\nNope. Baby bunny. \n\nIt was probably a few days old, it could fit in the palm of my hand. I didn\u2019t know where it came from or how long he had it (the campground was big) so I held that bunny wrapped in a thin towel in my shirt for fourteen hours. \n\nIf anyone knows Hope for Wildlife it took them a while to get out to me as I was pretty far toward New Brunswick. \n\nTL;DR: baby bunny got dropped by a cat in front of me. Held it for 14 hours until a rescue organization showed up.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: this is something that is rarely taught, and since pizza is eaten with the hands, it's important to have proper slices that can be enjoyed with ease.\n\n1. I like to let it rest a few minutes first, so the middle isn't a molten mess. You can let it rest after cutting too, but I prefer before.\n2. Have a quality pizza cutter, with the pizza on a hard surface.\n3. *Hit* the crust with the cutter. Use almost a stabbing motion so you slice completely through it in one go.\n4. Without lifting up the cutter, cut straight ahead with a decent amount of downward pressure. Do not go back and forth. This will muck up your pizza and create slivers. Just one elegant movement.\n5. When you hit the crust, increase speed and thrust, like follow-through in sports.\n6. Repeat this to cut into quarters, and then eighths.\n7. Enjoy your delicious pizza!\n\nSource: worked at a pizza place in NYC. This is how they do it.",

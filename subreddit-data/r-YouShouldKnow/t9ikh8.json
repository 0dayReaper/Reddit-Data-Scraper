Most of the time, the friend group is very aware of someone lying on a regular basis, but they choose to not confront it either out of apathy, or - more often - to not cause the liar embarrassment.\n\nSo, no, you\u2019re not a good liar, you just have good friends.\n\nWhy YSK: Because don\u2019t feel like you need to lie to make yourself more interesting. You\u2019re enough just the way you are.",

Asking me what I'd do if I found bones buried in the backyard. Asking me if I'd call the cops, if I'd get a lawyer, if I'd help cover it up. \n\nStarted saying he'd found my brother's (away at college) backpack in the backyard. Had me like 80% convinced my brother had straight up murdered somebody before I realized he was fucking with me. Funniest thing in my entire life was watching him pull the same shit on my mom when she got home while I stood there fighting so damn hard to keep a straight face.",

It was a coping mechanism I developed when I was very young (it's part of my first memories) to deal with the abuse at home. One day, in my 30s, I realized that when someone asked me something, they were expecting my personal opinion. I learned to say what people wanted to hear, so if you asked me \"is that person pretty?\" I'd say what I'd think most people would say, instead of telling you whether I liked that person or not.\n\nNow I have a huge problem because of that. When I tell people that I wasn't being honest before, they don't believe me. I've been diagnosed with many mental illnesses because my family thought I was suddenly seeing the world in a different way, when all that happened was that I started to speak my mind a few years ago. And of course I'm the one in the \"wrong\" because I'm no longer seeing things the way I was told to say they were and there was a lot of abuse that people are trying to cover up. I am fucked. I just wrote in /r/Romania that today I decided to leave this fucking place and go look for greener pastures. I make enough money to move pretty much anywhere in Europe except extremely costly places like Switzerland.\n\n---\n\nThen, there's this guy from high school, I forgot his name, but he would lie all the time about everything and he was even pretending that he was super rich but somehow he would constantly need to \"borrow\" money which he never returned, often for lunch. He also hung around with this other liar who tried to convince me that he had a voice-activated door when I visited him. Anyway, 15 year later, I casually ran into the first guy and he asked me to invest in his new start-up which would provide everyone with unlimited internet services like email and storage for only 1 cent/month. His plan was to beat Google. I wonder how he's doing...",

At one point, a few months into being his roommate he showed one of our friends a cover of a song that he made. The friend was blown away and insisted that he shared it with everyone else. We were all blown away, like practically looking at him in a new light because the cover was truly amazing. \n\nAnyway, about a week later, my friend found the EXACT same cover of the song my roommate played for us on Spotify with like hundreds of thousands of plays. It was really fucking awkward, and we came to realize that my roommate was essentially a chronic liar and was making up / embellishing almost everything we thought we knew about him.",

We had several DJs in our circle of friends, but she gave off a shady vibe and we felt she was trying too hard to fit in. She made the mistake of posting the tracklist with the mix. I just googled the first two songs together and found a mix with the exact same tracklist. I listened and it was that mix.  The kicker is, the original DJ put some vocal sample saying their DJ name over the first song as a kind of introduction, which was also in the woman\u2019s mix.  I called her out for it online and she got so much heat for it and eventually my friend broke up with her. Not for that incident but it was just the tip of the iceberg.",

In the case of my mom she's super insecure and was a career-woman who didn't get home until 7pm-8pm every night. So instead of being honest about being a somewhat absent mother she created this whole mythology about how she would somehow leave work at 6 or 7pm, commute home for at least an hour, do grocery shopping on her way home, then make dinner for the family in time for dinner at... 5pm...  Too bad she lost that time machine of hers... /s",

Then one day another coworker shared with me that he had seen her at the grocery store on the day she was supposed to be camping out in the wilderness.  Then other coworkers came forward with other contradictions, and I realized what they had known for a long time. She was a pathological liar. I couldn't see it because I am a gullible person. After my coworkers clued me in, I couldn't NOT see it.\n\nI was so relieved!  Her stories made her seem like such an impressive person that I felt like a major loser in comparison. She had convinced our boss that she was this amazing superwoman who knew everyone and could do everything. I was the exact opposite.  Well, one day the boss realized that she had been lying about something and fired her. It wasn't even a big thing that she had been lying about. But often it is the little lies that expose the fraudster, not the big ones.\n\nThe whole thing made me realize that there is a reason they call it pathological lying.

We are all judging everything and everyone all the time. And it is okay to judge as long as we are doing so mindfully and are attempting to do so with reliable information about a person or an event.\n\nIn the spirit of this post: if I catch you lying often, I will judge you as an untrustworthy source or one I cannot count on when I need to understand something that happened. And it would be good that I judge you so. Why would I willfully integrate bogus statements into my decision making?",

However, it was really bad for many years. That is until one of my friends said \"You do realize that it's totally okay if you DON'T know something or only know a little bit. It's also okay for you to not like things that other people like.\"  I knew that deep down but hearing out loud was like \"oh shit they know\". Luckily they knew it wasn't coming from a bad place but rather a people pleasing part of my personality. \n\nAnyway, if you feel comfortable enough, I'd suggest taking that person aside and calling them out quietly but have someone to back you up in case the person gives you pushback. I don't suggest a group  intervention though because a lot of people that act this way will retreat or find new friends when embarrassed in front of the whole group.",

I can't remember most of the lies now that it's been a few years, but I just remember talking to her and then immediately turning around every time to roll my eyes bc nothing she said was ever true. it definitely snapped me out of that kind of behavior (I was a teen at the time), and I notice it in others now. it's just sad and frustrating that these people need to be the heroes of everyone's story just to feel like they belong. just be you and quit lying",

Over the course of about a month, I slowly started to realize why people were so engaged by her stories: they were fabricated. The stories she told were the best parts of our experiences together slewn together to make a few grand stories. \n\n\nFor a long time, I thought that was what made a good story teller. I am so glad I figured out that was not who I wanted to be. I can now catch on very quickly when others do this haha. Her stories were amazing though!",

For me it really was 'compulsive', I would say things without even meaning to, or say something so often I wouldn't even know if ot was a lie anymore. it's a fear response.\nIt began as just 'lying to stay out of trouble', which slid into 'lying to make people like me', and eventually the line between 'acceptable lie' and 'unacceptable lie' blurs and the truth becomes negotiable. In specific reasons to your last question; for some people every action needs a detailed reason (I grew up in an environment where \"a simple no\" wasn't enough) so coming up with a non-negotaible reason for everything becomes second nature, and that slippery scale of 'shall white lie' and 'lie that makes me look good' makes the excuse into implausible bs.",

Their masked self (the web of lies) is used as a kind of sheild against their actual self.\n\nSome also do it out of plain boredom. What is more fun? A description of a police raid or you driving past a garage and seeing a closed sign. \n\nPlus if i just say it was closed then I have no idea where the conversation will turn next, I am not great at social situations and so setting the path of the discussion gives me more security in this conversation. \n\nWhen the former makes lies a habit then the latter two become a normal part of engaging with those around you. \n\nA lot of the time when someone is a persistent liar it is due to a number of reasons all colliding and not helping matters. \n\nMany also tend to make a swift exit when presented with evidence they are lying.

Lying about where you're from, what you do for a living, lying just to lie. As if the liar just simply gets off on deceiving others. I feel like it's a form of control for these poor, deluded people. To control the narrative of what they wish they were instead of what they truly are. \n\nWhat's really scary is when they believe the lies so much it becomes the truth.....to them. Most pathological liars have some minor or major form of personality disorder/anti-social behavior. It's sad because these people can get help through therapy and meds to break the cycle of self-loathing and self-deception. \n\nPathological lying is a learned trait that was usually reinforced in early childhood development by a traumatic event.

He was not only a habitual liar but seemed to thrive on the attention it got him, causing many of his lies to not only be petty, but absolutely OUTLANDISH. My wife and I would avoid him at social events because we felt like we were taking crazy pills. Is no one else bothered by him OBVIOUSLY MAKING THIS SHIT UP? \n\nI get that this friend group was mostly actors and artists but their patience and willingness to engage just made me feel like an asshole every time I'd pipe in and start asking legitimate question about *the time he went from a camp counselor in South America to smuggling youths across the border to get them away from the cartel, but then he got in some trouble and couldn't get in touch with his group/family had to hitchhike his way back home.* \n\nI could not let this go! He was like 22 at the time, for god's sake. Yet, for some reason the crowd all made me feel like I was being rude for not engaging his fantasy. So much of these, not just lies, but provably false and completely outlandish stories. Was South America before or after you spent a year training under an expert swordsman to become a world ranked fencer?\n\nWhen he got fired from his job he was so excited because going to get millions in a wrongful termination suit. His dad was supposedly a super successful lawyer and was going to somehow lay waste to what was one of the largest grocery chains in the US. To which I had some quesitons about how his dad, who had only ever practiced in one state clear across the country, would litigate a case in a field that he also did not practice (I looked him up. He's a contracts lawyer). \n\nThat was the last time I recall him being employed.\n\nIn the end he started a business with my friend and it was almost ruined because he was hit with some pretty serious sexual assault allegations, shared widely across the entire community and specifically naming the company. He chose to flee town dramatically in the night never to be heard from again.\n\nFor YEARS my wife and I just could not see how other people tolerated him and the drama that often came with. Obviously he was a wreck himself but I swear he was drain on everyone else too... but no one EVER admitted that they too thought he was full of shit and seemed to enjoy his company more than ours. Even after he left, a good amount of people were still on his side!",

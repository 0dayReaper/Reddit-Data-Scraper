I definitely appreciate when the house I'm visiting has a well-stocked bathroom!",

Am I racing the clock as the water fills? do I push only once then pull it out to see if it worked or not?  \n  \nLastly, after this battle is over, what do I do with the plunger? I wouldn't want to just put it back covered in poo, but how do i clean it? the sink? hold it in the bowl while i flush a few more times swishing it around in the \"cleaner\" water?  \n  \n(Please hurry someone just knocked)",

My guess was he rolled on his gnarly afghan to dry off.",

I asked her where does she put her used items. She said she carries them to her room and throws them away there. I was so shocked. She said it was okay for me to throw my used items away in bin that's in her room. It felt so uncomfortable walking out of the bathroom with my wrapped used pad to throw it away in her room. It felt wrong! After that, I tried to not have sleepovers at her house when I knew I was on my period.",

I thought you were gonna say to keep a box of pads or something else above the call of duty. Didn\u2019t realize the bar was set so low for us men. I\u2019m truly sorry ladies",

They definitely fall under in that unfortunate hospitality industry reputation as being systematically sexist (allowing sexual harassment as \"boys will be boys,\" refusing to hire women in management roles, etc). There are only two bathrooms, both unisex. Both bathrooms are large and only have one wastebasket near the sink for paper towels. In order to get from the toilet to the wastebasket near the sink, you have to walk like three or four steps.\n\nThis place has been in business like 5-10 years. I was the first person to ever bring up the fact they needed a wastebasket near the toilet for menstrual products. I asked every single women who worked there if they noticed this problem , and every single woman said it was a huge issue that affected them every month. On the weekends, the place is more like a nightclub, with a DJ, and drunk girls can't be bothered to walk their bloody tampons across the room, and would throw them on the floor. Management STILL didn't get wastebaskets when I brought it up, REPEATEDLY, because it didn't personally affect them. So frustrating.",

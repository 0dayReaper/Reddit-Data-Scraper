    "postText": "Why YSK: buying organic milk can save you money if you find yourself not using all of the milk before it expires.\n\nI discovered this recently by accident.  I normally buy conventional milk and I contantly run into issues where I have to throw some of it out because I forget about it.  Recently bought some organic milk not realizing my roomate already bought a gallon of milk.  Not only did the organic milk last until the gallon of milk was consumed, but it lasted at least three weeks without any issue.\n\nApparently organic milk can last up to a month or more though I haven't tested that.  Upon research, its longevity appears to be as a result of the pasteurization process it undergoes.  Basically, if you find yourself throwing out spoiled milk, buying organic, or at least milk that has undergone UHT processing might actually save you money in the long run.",

The only milk I can somewhat stomach to taste is non-fat milk.  I will use regular milk for baking, but anything where I taste it straight (such as in cereal) I can only stomach non-fat milk.\n\nPlus, my aunt and uncle own a dairy farm so I have had milk fresh from the cow and that stuff is the worst.

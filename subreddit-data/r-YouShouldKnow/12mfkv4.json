Some ways to spot one:\n\nMurky, or debris in water\nSandy water, that goes far out to sea\nChoppy water movement\nLess breaking waves\n\nRip currents can be 10-150 feet wide, they usually slow down as they move off shore.  Don't fight the current.  Swim parallel to the shore until you're away from the current, then swim diagonal towards the shore.\n\nIf you see anyone in trouble , call the coastguard the same way you call any other emergency service. 911 US, 999 UK.  \n\nWarn others on the beach, especially those with children.\n\nSource: Ex surfer / windsurfer / kitesurfer",

Treading water is great when you need to be upright and need to be fully aware of your surroundings like not smashing into rocks or jet skis. But if you waste all your energy treading and swimming against the rip - you may not have enough left in the tank to swim back to shore!",

I\u2019m a pretty average sized woman with a normal amount of body fat and I can rest on top of salt water like a cold pat of butter on a pancake.  My partner is also average size but has very little body fat and he does not float!  He doesn\u2019t exactly sink but his head is barely above water if he stops moving.  Are there any tips for such people?  I imagine it\u2019s true for lots of water athletes.",

He probably floats just fine face down, like every other human being out there but stiffens facing up. \n\nYou have to keep a really straight neck and almost look backwards abit, this keeps your nose as the highest point of your body and works against waves splashing down. It also forces your back straight. Second it helps not to breathe out fully - keeping air in the lungs increases buoyancy - so on the breath out keep 1/3 lung full and just breathe more/faster. \n\nI\u2019d you\u2019re in rough seas there\u2019s no way to keep your head above water 100% of the time, but you can time the waves and just relaxingly float breathing in between waves and it works great for recovery when you have to cover let\u2019s say 2kms with 0 stamina.",

So yes there are edge cases, but I have worked as a swimming instructor for young adults and have never met anybody who couldn\u2019t float if they tried under instruction. Some only float a bit (like a quarter of the face and sternum is above water) and others float like rubber (their ears are out of the water). So it\u2019s technique to work with your body shape to ensure you can indefinitely rest and breathe. Sure if you\u2019re an amputee or a bodybuilder there may be issues, not relevant for the regular person.",

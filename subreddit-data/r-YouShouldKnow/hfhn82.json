    "postText": "So there are people using something called a [\"Face Mask Exemption Card\"](https://i.imgur.com/05vz0IY.jpg) that claims they are exempt from wearing a mask under the ADA because of \"mental and/or physical risk to me\" and that refusal of service would be violating the ADA. These cards are completely fake, aren't enforceable, and (at the time of this post) the website on the card doesn't even exist. Take the card, inspect it carefully, and then throw it in the trash right before you throw the entitled Karen out of your establishment.",

It specifically outlines that the disabled person must detail what they are unable to do and then the business then gets to decide how to accommodate them. So if someone pitches a fit about not being let in without a mask and cites ADA, just calmly tell them you will come to their car instead. You are under no legal obligation to let them inside, disability or not.",

They offer curbside pickup for groceries and will load your car. The restaurant does curbside/ drive thru pickup. The store will bring your items to your car if you buy online for your stuff at the hardware store.\n\nThe accommodation does not get dictated by the customer. Now, if a customer is unhappy with their level of accommodation they can lodge a complaint.\n\nBut, the store has a solid defense. \"We didn't allow anyone to forego a mask because doing so would expose our other customers and employees to undo risk of contacting COVID-19.\" The customers right to browse does not supersede the employees and customer's right to not get coronavirus.\n\nBesides- if you don't want a mask touching your face for 30 minutes you'll have so much fun with a vent.",

If your website is not ADA compliant (which to this day there is no actual standard set forth by our federal government because that group has been gutted by the federal government) then you can be sued by predatory scumbag lawyers. The website needs to have things such as certain white spacing, text to speech, mouse functionality, a 24/7 number someone can call, can be navigated by using just a keep board, etc. The worst part of the situation is that the claimant no longer needs to notify the domain owner prior to using it like back in the day where a physical business owner had 30 days or something to accommodate the request before they are held liable and can be sued for monetary compensation. So as a lesson to all this, get your site professionally audited for your small business before you get sued by scumbags that want $4000 per violation and you end up settling.",

Everyone who can should to protect those who cannot get them. With asthma she's at higher risk due to the mask, but with a mask she won't last 15 minutes before she can't breathe.",

It doesn't have to wear a vest. It's an honor system between you and the business. A business can ask if an animal is a service animal and what tasks it does. They can't ask anything beyond that, and they don't need proof from you.\n\nHere's the sticker: your service animal does have to behave itself in public spaces. Businesses are fully within their rights to ask you to remove the animal from the building regardless of the services it provides if it is being disruptive to other patrons or destroying property.\n\nThat's not really an issue, because actual service animals are usually as disruptive as any other piece of medical equipment. It's mostly an issue for Karens with purse rats who think their online \"registration\" is a \"bring your dog everywhere\" card, even though Fifi licks the produce and barks at other customers.",

San Diego is having the mother tested when she gets there, or if it\u2019s planned the day before, so once the negative results come back she can be relatively comfortable in her own room. \n\nObviously while I was in labor and leading up to my c section (it wasn\u2019t planned it was an emergency, so I was in labor for a day and a half before having it) it was *terrible*. It\u2019s especially bad because you get so hot and sweaty giving birth anyway, and the mask makes it so much worse.\n\nBut you know what sucks more than that? Having someone you love die of an illness that the transmission of very easily could have been prevented by wearing a mask. I\u2019m not going to be that asshole who kills someone.\n\nAlso my doctors office was right next to the clinic that deals exclusively with HIV/AIDS patients in my city. They were in the same building, literally a door apart. The amount of women I saw arguing about wearing a mask was insane. Like there\u2019s a clinic full of people right next to you and some of them effectively have no immune systems, and you\u2019re arguing about having to wear a mask to protect them? It\u2019s just a fucking mask. To protect people. To not kill them. Mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters and children. They are people. Who need a little bit of help right now.

I *NEVER* see protests for laws that require women to gestate ALL the zygotes (remember, according to the RTL groups they are human beings that deserve every opportunity to experience this world and not allowing them to is at best abuse, and at worst murder) that are created. There's never a rush to shame women who are going into an IVF clinic. There's never a rush to close down IVF clinics.\n\nEvery extraction for IVF removes 8-15 eggs. Those eggs are then inseminated and 2-3 are chosen to implant. Those not chosen to be born are then either dunked into liquid nitrogen (which is cruel because it denies the child a chance to grow naturally), or killed and used for science, or simply thrown away.\n\nAccording to [this data](https://nccd.cdc.gov/drh_art/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DRH_ART.ClinicInfo&amp;rdRequestForward=True&amp;ClinicId=9999&amp;ShowNational=1), 284,385 retrievals were made in 2017, which means a minimum of 2,275,080 zygotes were created and a maximum of 4,265,775 zygotes were created. The number of live births from IVF procedures was 78,052 in 2017.\n\nThis leaves a minimum of nearly 2,200,000 human beings (according to their own beliefs) to be refused a chance to grow and develop. Most of those human beings (according to their beliefs) will simply have their souls discarded or flushed away, not even having a decent funeral.\n\nContrast that 2,200,000 number with the number of abortions performed in the US in 2017: 862,320.\n\nTHREE TIMES as many human souls are destroyed using IVF than abortion, but there's never a serious peep from pro-life groups about that. No insistence on laws that insist on one egg being removed and only one zygote created and implanted at a time. (This would squash all the moral problems with IVF, but would also plummet the success rate and make IVF 8-10 times more expensive than it already is.) No laws that would force a woman to gestate all the zygotes that were created, laws that would mimic the conservative talking point of \"if you can't raise them, you shouldn't have created them.\"\n\nConservative groups that claim \"but IVF creates lives\" are literally saying it is worth killing 7 children so one can be born. But they don't say the same to women who have abortions who later go on to have healthy children.",

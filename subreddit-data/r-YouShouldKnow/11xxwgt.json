We realized for a few months that we were playing $14.99 a month for Prime but decided to cancel mine and join my account to hers since we live in the same house now. Now we share one account and can even share the credit cards on file as well as adding kids. Saved 15 bucks a month!\n\n[Link to info](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GXULX24SE2RD7EXS)",

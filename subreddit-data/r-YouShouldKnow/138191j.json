    "postText": "Why YSK: I'll try this again. Wealthfront is offering the best rate I have been able to find. Been using them for awhile now and they have the fastest to reach (15 seconds to get a human on the line), and all around best customer support I've seen in the last several years. Just got a notification that on May 5th they are raising their interest rates from 4.3% to 4.55%, and I have a promo link that will boost it to 5.05%. Let me know if you would like a link promo link or have any questions.",

It's comparing Apples and Oranges, stopping when you get to \"They're both fruits\" and thinking you've got the right answer.\n\nCDs and I Bonds offer those rates because your money is guaranteed locked up for a set period of time and the interest is penalized if you need to liquify.",

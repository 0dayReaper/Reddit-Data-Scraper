Here are answers to some of the top questions...\n\n-\tDo I still have to wipe? It\u2019s less of a wipe, and more of a gentle blot to dry the area. It only takes a few squares of toilet paper, far less than what you\u2019d typically use to wipe.\n-\tAre they just for the butt? It depends on the model you get. Some also offer a \u201cfemale mode\u201d that changes the angle of the stream.\n-\tIsn\u2019t it cold? Again, depends on the model. You can get a model that only has cold water for around $20. It taps into the toilet\u2019s clean water line. For slightly more (~$60-80) you can get a model that also has a hot water line hook up. This is only efficient if your sink/shower/tub is on the same wall as your toilet since it will require tapping into a hot water line. This is also not ideal if it usually takes more than 20 seconds for the water in the bathroom to get hot when you turn it on. It only takes a few seconds of water to clean yourself, so you\u2019ll be done before the hot water even gets there. And to be honest, it\u2019s such a short blast of water you barely have time to feel it. For $300-1000 you can get a bidet that requires an outlet and cold water line and will heat the water on-demand the same way an electric kettle does. The Toto s550 is the top of the line model with many additional features like a sanitizer, air dryer, and remote control.\n-\tI\u2019m not very handy, is it hard to install? Nope, super simple and involves a wrench and about 10-30 minutes depending on which model you buy.\n-\tI rent so what are my options? All of the bidet seat attachments are non-destructive so you can install it and then uninstall it when your lease is up.\n-\tWhat about when I\u2019m not home? There are portable bidets for $5-80 on Amazon. On the low end, you can get a plastic nozzle that screws onto standard Poland Springs/Dasani-type water bottles. On the high end, you can get an electric Toto that you fill in the sink and then use. It\u2019s a little bulky so it\u2019s not ideal to carry around, but it\u2019s great to keep at work or in your hotel bathroom when traveling.\n\nOverall, bidets are one of the best quality of life improvements you can make for the least amount of money and effort. You\u2019ll kick yourself for not getting one sooner! Luxe Bidet and Toto are the brands I have experience with and can personally recommend.",

Also, I was thinking it would really cut back on how much tp was needed, but so far it seems to basically just cut it in half.\n\nEdit: bonus: my fiancee tried it and her aim was off so it just completely soaked her clothes and she had to change. It was worth it just for that.\n\nEdit 2: I have had my fair share of inbox blowups but I never thought it would come from a poo comment. I don't live in the US and we don't have Charmin. When this whole toilet paper thing dies down, I will find a stronger brand. I was having a poo when I made this original comment and I had another just now and it is indeed getting easier every time. I'm not currently willing to get a towel. Perhaps after getting the technique right. Currently, I'd have to toss the towel after one use. Thanks for all the feedback everyone.",

You may change your mind.\n\n&gt; I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to all though tasteless, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble pooping. No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with somepaper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold. I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \"Hey, this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!\" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \"How many Indians could there be?\" said by General Custer. \"Looks like a good day for a drive!\" by JFK. \"There! America On-line now has complete Usenet access!\" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn babe. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\n&gt; \n&gt; Little did I know. I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poop -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky poop/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm. Unfortunately, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering poop/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own poop blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \"It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.\" Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil. As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\n&gt; \n&gt; Friends-DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!",

On the one I've got, I have to scoot my butt forward a bit or the spray goes to my nuts. Once you get the aim right, the water splashes right back down into the toilet with everything else.\n\n2) good toilet paper is key. I have to deal with this issue myself. If you're of particularly hairy nature, you might have to jiggle a little to get most of the water off first. Good solid two ply paper can usually handle some wetness. If it's really bad, you can usually pat dry with a small bit of TP and then wipe dry with a second small amount. But, that only tends to happen with lower quality TP.\n\nMy wife and I go through about a roll of TP every 1.5 - 2 weeks or so. That's for a cotonelle roll that's pretty fat, so if it were a more standard roll of paper, it would probably last us a week or so, and it's mostly her that uses the paper.",

All that's separating the shit and his fingers is some white sheets of paper, which he then disposes of to form a big pile of stinky crumpled up stained brown white paper. Honestly, how have western countries and the entire world as I assume not caught on to using water to clean your asshole? You use water to wash your hands and body, why not you butt? It's cheaper and less disgusting. Get a portable bidet and stop freaking out.\n\nEdit: even if super thick toilet paper exists, what do you  guys do when you have diarrhea?",

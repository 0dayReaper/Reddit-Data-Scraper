    "postText": "Teaching kids about bodily autonomy from an early age is crucial, and giving them the tools to politely (but firmly) say \"No\" when they feel uncomfortable  performing affectionate acts is a great first step. \n\nCritically, this must include parents and other family members,  even if those people get their feelings hurt. The child's bodily autonomy and setting them up for their future as adults is more important than Great-Aunt Gertrude getting a halfhearted hug.\n\n\nTHIS ALSO APPLIES TO TICKLING. If a kid breathlessly asks you to stop tickling them, *even if they appear to be enjoying themselves and laughing*, it's important that you stop for them to catch their breath and do a quick check-in to see of they want to continue. \n\n Almost every time I've done this with my own son, he will ask for more tickles after catching his breath.\n\n It's about letting them know that their body belongs to THEM. \n\n**WHY YSK:**\n\nBecause everyone has the right to decide whether they want to be touched,  and that includes children,  from as early as possible. \n\nThere are countless examples of all the dark things that kids suffer through every day which I don't need to get into, we all know what they are. \n\nTo be clear, it is NEVER the child's fault if they are  victimized,  nor is this advice meant to be some kind of protection against evil. \n\nI'm a mother to a toddler, and my husband and I are in full agreement on this, practicing what we preach.  If kiddo doesn't want to get all cuddled up on, he knows he can always refuse and we will listen.",

            "comment": "Even as a PRE-K teacher I try to teach children this. When someone says stop or no you have to respect their words. Sometimes the kid whose been attached to my leg all day long the day before doesn't want to give me a hug the next day. Cool. Can I get a high-five? No? How about a thumbs up? No? That's cool too. Hi kiddo, go play. In an hour they'll be all over me again, but in that moment they said no, so I have to respect it.\n\nParents, please don't force kids to hug people. They're not being rude. Its okay if they feel shy in that moment for someone they see on the regular, it'll probably change in a bit, or not. But forcing just tells them not the expect to be respected or listened to. I'm an adult, we are adults, we can manage our expectations and 'hurt feelings'.",

Do you agree with this strategy?\n\nEdit: as /u/thesimplerobot pointed out, phrasing it as \"Would you like a hug?\" is an even better way to frame it. Thanks!",

I will, however, try again later. If they cry again, I don't push it. Now they are starting to walk (they are a little delayed due to being preemies) but they crawl well, and will go up to family. Will they just make it known they dont want to, similar to them crying now? \n\nHow do you teach them to even say no? What if they don't understand that they can say, \"No\"? For example: grandma says, \"Give me a hug, honey,\" (not forceful and she never would be) but the child doesnt want to, but gives a hug anyway because they don't know they can reject. How do you show them it is ok, even if the other person reacts negatively?\n\nI hope any of this made sense, I've been thinking this for a little while now and would love some help! Thank you!",

At young ages, I think most kids have no qualms about saying no, whether it's bathtime, bedtime, toys, or hugs.

Something I would do is follow up someone else's directive (ex. come hug me) with my own question (ex. do you want to hug ___).  That does two things: it gives your child a way out, and establishes to the other party that such things should be questions, not demands.  I hope that helps!",

That way when they don't feel right when someone starts touching them below the belt as a teenager, they know to trust that instinct and try to stop it.

At 28, I still feel guilted into hugs at family gatherings and it makes me want to puke.  And then they give me that look of \u201cwow, way to be rude about it\u201d and make me feel guiltier.\n\nI have quite a number of younger members of the extended family, but this one kid who was about 10 was being forced to give me the hug from his mom (i was 24ish atm and i didn\u2019t ask for one, she started it).  I saw the look of terror in his eyes and knew exactly how he felt. To please his mom and to make him feel better, I offered a fist bump and he had a massive smile and she actually thought that was cute. He totally knew that hugging shouldn\u2019t be forced and is traumatizing and he loved that I understood him.  I have done that with every kid whoever \u201cneeds\u201d to hug me since so they have a choice to appease their parents depending on their comfort level with me. And guess what, most choose the fist bump!\n\nEDIT: wow, my first award! I\u2019m so glad people can relate and I\u2019m not alone.  Also hopefully you\u2019ll use my idea whenever you\u2019re \u201cneeded\u201d for a hug to help all those other scared children who just don\u2019t want to be forced to hug and kiss people.

My uncle started to tickle me, and although I said to stop, he didn\u2019t. Because I was laughing I guess he thought I was enjoying it. All the adults were sitting around just watching and laughing. He was being too rough. It scared me. I still remember how powerless I felt. When he finally stopped and I was able to get off my back and onto my feet I hit him as hard as I could, which wasn\u2019t very hard since I was a 4 year old girl. \n\nMy mom yelled at me infront of everyone which embarrassed me. I just felt so betrayed that my parents (or anybody else in the room) didn\u2019t stick up for me. I ran off and hid in the backyard and nobody checked on me once to see if I was ok. I was not ok. \n\nIt was then that I realized I couldn\u2019t count on my family to help me. At 4. Also that if an older man wants to touch me he can and there is nothing I can do about it. If I fight back I get in trouble so it\u2019s better to not resist. That\u2019s not a good lesson to teach during the formative years. I know that\u2019s not what they were trying to teach, but that\u2019s what I learned.\n\nAnd to this day I do not have a good relationship with my parents (they\u2019ve done other things through the years that made me lose trust in them) and I only speak to my grandparents on that side of the family and only around the holidays. I just don\u2019t feel close to any of them. I never felt safe around any of them after that and I never got physical close enough to my uncle for him to touch me ever again. \n\nI actually liked being tickled. And I am still very ticklish, but if someone tries it\u2019s like my brain clicks to a different mode. I\u2019m not sure how else to describe it.  I can will myself not to laugh and stare at the person doing it till they get uncomfortable and stop.\n\nSo don\u2019t keep ticking kids when they say stop. Please.",

That is when I stepped in and began a narrative with them about the importance of concent. \n\nAlthough my parents have a very old school mentality and never fully agreed with me \"interfering with their relationship\", it became apparent that it was necessary when my 6 year old niece voiced how \"sometimes I don't like it when older people don't listen\".

I was worried about creating a scene over it that made it look like I was criticizing my BIL's parenting by being \"that SJW liberal snowflake\" of the family. \n\nIt's such a better idea to approach the *actual child* than it is the parent, I should have trusted them more to make their own decisions about how they feel and empower them to vocalize it. Next time I'll let them know that they don't have to give me a kiss if they don't want to and trust that lesson will be enough for the kids to start their own conversations if they need to, then I'll be there to back them up.",

            "comment": "Growing up, my step grandfather (my dad's stepdad) would insist on us sitting on his lap, giving him kisses, etc. My parents told him to stop but he continued, mostly behind their backs. \n\nWe thought it was normal, all the touching. I'm 20 now. My mom only just found out a couple months ago (cause I casually brought it up in a conversation) how when I was maybe 8, me, my brother (6ish) and sister (10ish) were spending the night at my grandparents house. After my grandmother went to sleep, my grandfather came and woke us up and said we were allowed to swim in the pool under 1 condition; we skinny dipped. \n\nBeing so young we didn't know anything was wrong with it, and so we did it. And he just watched. For 2 hours. \n\nThere are other stories, like him making sexual remarks to our cousin who was around 11 at the time, like when she was swimming in their pool I guess the water was cold because her nipples were stiff and he called her \"Princess Arriola\", as in Princess Ariel. \n\nWhen I was 11 we stopped talking to them, for many different reasons. Well they wanted \"revenge\" or something for \"stealing their grandchildren\", so they went to our counties CPS and painted a wild picture of my parents sexually abusing and neglecting us (all fake!), but the CPS said they didn't have a case due to lack of evidence. So they went to a different counties CPS and told them this lie, and since the system is completely fucked, the police showed up and took us away from our parents. We didn't see them for 3 months. It was a nightmare, I have separation anxiety from the whole ordeal plus many other lingering issues. But the only reason our parents got us back so soon was because my grandparents lawyer was basically \"So since they definitely sexually abused the kids, what would really make you guys win is to do full body exams and tests on them!\" I'm talking fully nude, invading your body type exams and tests. Of course they couldn't say they lied, so they had to go along. Meanwhile my grandmother is freaking out. The way the court had it set up was if either one of the parties broke the visitation agreement, the whole thing was void. As in if one weekend my grandparents wanted to drop us off at my parents, but it wasn't in the formal agreement, and they dropped us off anyways, the whole thing is immediately void. \n\nWell, that's exactly what happened. One night after my grandfather went to sleep, my grandmother got us all in the car and dropped us on my parents porch. Turns out my grandmother was terrified that the sexual abuse tests would come back positive, but not that my parents had done anything - that my grandpa had, and she didn't want him to find out. \n\nThankfully he never touched us, or at least me. If he did touch my siblings I never found out. But when my grandma dropped us off, turns out all 3 of us were all very sick with strep throat and pneumonia and we had to go to the hospital.\n\nWe've not spoken to that side of the family in 9 years now, and we all fully agree that he is a pedophile who has not been caught yet. \n\nMoral of the story: teach your kids about this stuff so they don't think kissing and skinny dipping with their creepy grandpa is normal!",

And \"affection\"; what is affection? In some countries kissing is affection in others kissing is merely a greeting.\n\nWhat it comes down to is...

I see this tossed around a lot and I haven\u2019t read anything that actually supports this view point, other than opinion pieces\n\nThis was my question too. This is being asserted as an absolute no-brainer statement of fact. A lot of advice about child development seems to assume that the one-size-fits-all end goal of parenting is to raise an utterly self-regarding individual with a very clear sense of their own boundaries and desires with little or no commensurate on focus on community norms, cultural norms or the well-being/interior life of others.  It feels like a psychological operationalization of the idea that if everyone looks out for their own well-being that will necessarily lead to beneficial outcomes for collectives of individuals, and I'm really not sure I buy that.\n\nWe don't want to force kids to touch people they don't want to? Ok, I don't have a problem with that\u2014but the high level of confidence and absolute right and wrong with which this is expressed feels unearned and unsupported. Kind of an enormous part of being a functioning human in society is that you frequently have to do things that you don't want to. It seems to me that expressing goodwill and affection for others in a healthy way is not really something that comes naturally to a lot of people\u2014I think it's a muscle you have to flex or you lose it. Does the fact that it doesn't come naturally to a lot of people mean it's not a valuable behavior to encourage? I'm not so sure.\n\nI don't know, I'm sure I'll be deluged with downvotes and comments about how much I don't get the difficulty of what it's like to feel pressured to express affection you don't want to. I've had experiences like that, too but on balance, deprivation of human touch seems to me to be much more damaging.\n\nI'm sure the absolutism of the original post is intended as a corrective to a major and widespread perceived problem but I do think introducing that much friction into typical expressions of familial affection feels like an overcorrection.",

As a result, I ended up being more and more unfamiliar and uncomfortable with touch, which contributed to isolation and discomfort around people as I got older (late elementary school, middle school,  HS). I can remember brushing up against people accidentally in high school and recoiling instinctively, even if it was someone I had a crush on. \n\nFor various reasons, my parents tried taking me to a psychologist a few times. But I was willful, did well academically, had no overt behavior problems, and no desire for therapy, so there was no reason for anyone to insist. And actually, I consider my childhood to have been pretty happy.\n\nIt wasn't until much later that I started having relationships and being more comfortable with touch, and I still tend to be overly sensitive sometimes. I think it would have been healthier to have had more skinship as a child. But I remember that whenever my parents tried, I would scowl and ask them to stop.

I recoiled enough from touch in middle school that my older siblings' friends made up a nickname about it. But now in my late 20s I really enjoy touch and being touched, but with a trusted person.",

It actually activates the same brain pathways as being injured.\n\nIt could actually be a sign you are neurodivergent, cause we experience it often. Especially if you experience a similar sensation when faced with loud/complex sounds, bright lights, certain colours, specific textures, etc. For example, mine gets set off by hair touching, light touching, multiple sounds at the same volume, damp skin (but not showers, for some reason), polyester, and high pitched whining sounds. Probably a few more but those are the first examples I can think of, so you get an idea if you experience this in other parts of life.",

I acted odd in many ways but since I was doing well academically and didn't cause any trouble I was left alone. I think I probably could have used some therapy at some point. \n\nWhat saved me somewhat was going on a year long student exchange abroad at 16. My family was very surprised that I wanted to do this, but was also happy to let me go. I knew that would force and allow me to break out of my weird encrusted habits. Curiously enough, it was more the coming back than the going away that allowed me to readjust. \n\nI can't help but wonder how my life would have turned out if my mom was less prepared to put up with my shit. I'm really on the fence here. Maybe I would have become a better adjusted adult. Maybe we would just have a bad relationship today. Maybe nothing would have changed and my childhood would have been just a lot more stressful.\n\nIt's great to give a child lots of autonomy and respect their decisions but on the other hand it can be crushing if you're responsible at a young age for decisions that go way over your head. \n\n I had to make an important decision at 17, where I'd say today I didn't understand the full scope how it would affect my life. But then, 17 surely should be old enough, when you're also trusted with decisions like choosing your profession, enlisting or even driving a car.\n\nBut then, when *do* you become old enough to make life-changing decisions?",

I had one aunt though who I just had bad vibes about. She would legit hunt me and my brother down at family gatherings to give us a hug and pick us up even when I was 10. She would also give raspberries and tickle us and her hugs would squish us into her bosom. I dreaded family events cause of her. We would hide from her when we saw her vehicle pull up. We knew that if we at least made it until mealtime she couldn\u2019t hug us cause we\u2019d all be carrying food.   \n\nLater on our parents told us more about her, she was sexually abused as a kid by her father and uncles well into her teens. Obviously that isn\u2019t her fault but she didn\u2019t and still kinda doesn\u2019t know proper boundaries. Within minutes of meeting a foster kid she was giving an 8 year old raspberries.  She\u2019s just weird.",

ME. GO. YOU MUST LET GO OF ME\" (and we have a formal \"you\" and informal you, o used the informal one...) \nAnd my mum shrugged and went \"well you didn't ask if you could pick her up.\" \n\nYour post says children can give a polite \"no\". I was impolite as fuck, but honestly... It worked. The teenagers stopped picking me up without asking, the adults stopped touching my hair, and my future preschool teacher put me back down and opened the gate for me instead. It startles people because they're not used to small kids being so firm and so straight forward without please or thank you.",

            "comment": "So kids as young as 3 or 4 are allowed to decide their \"personal boundaries\" and are supposed to have enough self-awareness and intelligence to decide what they want to do?  You people are fucking insane. Yes you don't need to make your kids mouth kiss strangers but teaching kids that they have to shake hands or do things that they're uncomfortable with is part of a parent's job in teaching them.\n\n I get what you're saying to that yeah if your kid doesn't want to be tickled don't fucking tickle him, but you went way too far in the other direction. And I also understand that what you're saying is that kids should have the right to their bodies and that they aren't toys for adults to play with, I completely understand what you're saying as keeping hands to yourself is one of the core lessons every child has to learn. But not at the expense of everything else.\n\nyou are going to have to do things in life that you don't want to do and the earlier that you make kids realize that the better. Once again this is where the actual PARENTING comes in and which circumstances you force your children to do things and make them uncomfortable but to overall just say that a kid can just tell you no because they feel uncomfortable is fucking absolute horse shit. Anybody that believes that is doing a disservice to their children. \n\nYou know what, I don't feel comfortable with talking to parents of kids that cause problems. I don't feel comfortable going to the bank, I don't feel comfortable talking on the phone period but these are all things I have to do because thats life. You are planting a very dangerous seed of \"if I'm not comfortable that means I don't have to do it\".\n\nthis new age \"kids are able to do whatever they want and they can figure it out in their own\" is going to raise a whole generation of kids that are lost and confused because they weren't raised with proper structure, discipline, and guidance. kids, especially young kids, need to be told that sometimes life is hard or life is uncomfortable but you have to do it anyways because that's how you grow. Maybe stay off Reddit for parenting advice and read an actual parenting book or psychology journal.\n\n\"It's more important than Aunt Gertrude getting a hug\" \n\nActually, it's important to teach your kids that the world does not revolve around them and they have to do things that they don't want to do sometimes. AND your family is fucking important and a hug is not the biggest deal in the world.  It is so short-sighted and ridiculous that that is your line of thinking. It's so selfish and self-centered. Your kid is going to grow up thinking they can do whatever whenever they want because \"it's their right\".\n\nAnd more importantly what credentials or training do you have to give any advice on parenting?? It is completely ridiculous that you think that this is advice you need to be giving just because you're a mom of a toddler. A lot of moms don't know what the fuck they're talking about. \n\nMy source, education degree with almost 10 years or teaching experience. Parents like you make teaching so much more difficult than it needs to be. I'm sorry if this comes off harsh but the audacity that some parents have is absurd.",

My son has learned from a very early age to ask first before touching anyone so he asks for hugs, kisses, high fives, etc. \n\nI'll add that of course he doesn't have to ask me or my fiance, he knows that there are friends and family members who give endless consent for affection, but if he ever feels even the slightest bit unsure, he asks. He is also not afraid to say no thanks to any unwanted contact. I absolutely hated being forced to kiss older male family members as a child and I am hellbent that I won't force my own children to do it, either. No means no for everyone.",

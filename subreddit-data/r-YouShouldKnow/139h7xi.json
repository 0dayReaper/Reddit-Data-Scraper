    "postText": "Why YSK It's hard to believe that laws have been passed in Uganda criminalizing homosexuality yet the same has come to Kenya where we came to seek refugee. It beats my mind and think it was a mistake to run to Kenya because I have found Kenya also being homophobic to queer asyrants from all East African countries, we have no space here in Kenya as well now I wonder why UNHCR Kenya remains silent, as we continue to suffer these discriminatory rules that leads us to mental torture, hate, discrimination, segregation as well as hatred.\n\nI would urge UNHCR and the united nations organization to urgently take an action on how to Evacuate the 2000 and more  victims of homophobia, discrimination, persecution and death from Kenya to any third world country that can welcome us regardless of our sexual orientations and preferences.\n\nI have sat down and write here incase anyone knows any LGBT organizations that can urgently take an action potential to save us from this horrible and horrifying situation at kakuma, if at all anybody has any way to on how to intervene please consider our humble request for support, remember black LGBTIQ lives matters too.\n\nLastly thanks to Lewis Hamilton , f1  only black driver, who frequently speaks out about social justice and LGBTIQ+ issues . This is the kind of love and solidarity we need at this moment where homophobic laws and death has become a ln order of the day at camos and other places in Africa.\n\nWormly Liam an LGBTIQ activist and representative at the second lergest camp in the world, KAKUMA REFUGEES CAMP LOCATED IN THE NORTH WEST TURKANA REGION.",

            "comment": "UNHCR is acutely aware, but also limited in what it can do. Lots of grassroots organisations organise in Kenya, and some also provide shelter to individuals at risk. I can't name any specific, but [take a look at UNHCR's dedicated page](https://help.unhcr.org/kenya/helpful-services/assistance-to-persons-with-specific-needs/) and/or contact the SGBV lead. I believe UNFPA still operate safe spaces in Kakuma at least, and Danish Refugee Council is the protection lead.  If you're in Dadaab, the situation will be similar. If you're an urban refugee, search for NGOs in that area that work on gender equality or similar, they will also be able to advice.",

I believe if you believe that lgbt+ is not \"the right way of life\" then keep it to yourself since no one is forcing you to not be straight but you have no right to tell others not to live the way they want to.\n\nIt would be fine to disagree if it didn't lead to countries locking lgbt+ people up castrating them or in worst cases even killing them.\n\nYou and I are lucky we can live how society deems fit but just imagine how awful it must be to just love someone different and being told to die for it. Lets be empathetic it won't hurt us",

The media and everything is still majority straight representative it shouldn't make you so mad that a few shows don't cater to your lifestyle anymore. \n\nIf you can't understand why people telling lgbt+ people they don't agree with their lifestyle leads to laws being made then you're either too young or actually just ignorant.

In fact,  I'm saying the opposite; yes,  the US had a homophobic influence in Africa. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that you have too much of an American Centric view and bias.  There were multiple influences that increased homophobia in Africa. As an example:\n\nhttps://www.aaihs.org/did-europe-bring-homophobia-to-africa/",

I personally feel like addressing multiple causes increases the understanding and doesn't then just focus the blame and solutions on one of the influences. \n\nIt's going to take a lot of work,  but I strongly feel that as diversity in knowledge is increased, less homophobia can exist.

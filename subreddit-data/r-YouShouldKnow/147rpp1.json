Mars is sometimes the closest planet but during the timespan of the revolution of Earth or should I say every other planet, Mars is the closest planet on an average.",

            "comment": "This tends to be controversial due to ambiguity in definitions:\n\n&gt; In the astronomical literature, the term \"closest planets\" often means \"the two planets that approach each other most closely\". In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. For example, essentially because Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is \"closest to Earth when averaged over time\". However, using this time-average definition of 'closeness'\u2014as noted above\u2014it turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to all other planets in the solar system.\n\n&gt; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_\\(planet\\)#cite_ref-fact_4-13)",

Beta radiation can be dangerous, but it depends on the energy of the particles and it's mainly if you ingest or inhale the emitter. In tritium's case the beta particles are low energy, meaning they don't penetrate the skin very much, so the main danger would be inhalation, but you would need to inhale the contents of hundreds (perhaps thousands) of vials on purpose for it to harm you.",

Anyway, by the time they were brave enough to tell an adult (since parents in the 80's didn't know any parenting beyond \"punish until your eyes bleed\", they were afraid of getting in trouble), the kid had been in there awhile and suffered massive brain damage. He survived, but his parents were vocal in the press for years about the need for escape handles (and teaching your kids about the dangers of locking friends into spaces for a game, of course).",

Good thing we have this big stick handy in case they wake up too early. They'll have huge amounts of brain damage but presumably you wouldn't care.\n\nHow exactly are you kidnapping someone just by stuffing them in a trunk? They'd kick out whenever you let go and try to jam you from closing the boot and shout out the whole time.\n\nYou need to restrain them somehow to kidnap them long term.\n\nSimilarly if you're doing it quickly how are you stuffing them in a trunk? A van would be much better suited, especially because you can then hold them down and tie them up in the back of the van.\n\nEdit:\nFor the lever to be even vaguely useful you need to be conscious, untied and non-blindfolded.

If the car I was gonna use had one I'd clip the cable then tie the glow in the dark handle to a piece of sheet metal that would be affixed to the car. So when they pulled on it it'd make a loud sheet metal sound letting me know they're awake and/or managed to get untied. The metal sound might give them the impression the trunk is almost opening inspiring them to pull it more vigorously. I may even glue a razor or nail under the handle so they'd cut themselves trying to pull it (depending how much I wanted to hurt them or be okay with the car getting blood on it). I'd also put some razor wire or a wood block behind the lights in the trunk. I've heard if you're in a trunk you can knock out the lights and use the newly created hole to seek help. Not sure how accurate it is but might as well make it a little harder to accomplish.",

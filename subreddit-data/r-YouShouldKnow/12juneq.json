I realize that looking for them is privileged time that some folks don\u2019t have and not everyone has access to the kinds of neighborhoods I thrift in either. This is not lost on me. \n\nWhen shopping, I always look at tags, seams, feel of the cloth, the same as many others, I assume. I don\u2019t claim to be any better than anyone else at telling them apart, but, I do have a bit of experience with middle class quality items and the demand for that isn\u2019t going to go down. \n\nThere are even less upper middle class items to be had and sometimes I can go several trips without finding anything that is worthwhile but the thing is, is that I also am privileged to have a very boring lifestyle where I have no kids, don\u2019t party that hard and end up with some things I\u2019m likely to die before they become useless simply because it will see minimal use. \n\nThe point is is that it\u2019s late, I\u2019m rambling and I wanted to point out that not everyone can thrift in stores that get genuine luxury items for very inexpensive prices especially around donation for tax write off time where the wealthy just dump off a wardrobe they don\u2019t wear just because they needed to push their donations up or they just wanna buy a new wardrobe.\n\nThe wealthy do weird things that only people with big money can be \u201cless intelligent\u201d about.",

Lower thread count cotton is most comfortable for us but it never fails, my husband will put a hole in them in a year or less. It's frustrating. But I have sort been at my wits end about it. For our wedding we got two very nice sets of sheets that I just loved but even those got holes in a couple of years. My MIL bought us a $250 set this past winter... we'll see how they do. I don't have terribly high hopes. My husband is like sleeping with a hurricane. He does the alligator death roll and the sheets don't stand a chance lol",

Some fibres - like cotton - are indeed durable and can last a long time, provided the thread count and thread length used are high.\n\nManufacturers have been skimming on both properties for years now, to maxmise profits. \"Quality\" brands also lowered quality of their fabrics to cut costs - also because since fast fashion makes customers throw out products earier, they do not seem to notice the lower quality.\n\nI saw an example of a Ralph Laured red polo shirt from 40 years ago, still looking crisp and new shirts piling after a few years. Unfortunately this means that it's really hard for a consumer to know what is good quality because price is not always a good indication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut a general rule of a thumb: if fabric is mixed with synthetic fibres, it almost always lowers the durability.",

But for example, I only wash jeans with other jeans because they are too and heavy and rough for my tee shirts and socks to withstand. The friction would tear holes in them. Same deal with towels. Too heavy to wash with shirts, but sometimes okay with jeans. Cold water is usually better than hot. If you must tumble dry, use low heat. Some things might need to be handwashed and laid flat or him to dry. Also, you don't need to wash many things after one use (besides underthings obviously). The fewer washes, the longer your things will last. Artificial fabrics like polyester and rayon will wear faster than natural fibres like silk, cotton, linen, or wool. Natural fibres are also more environmentally friendly as they need very little processing in order to make a strand for weaving or knitting. Bamboo must be chemically treated to make it suitable for woven cloth. Uses a lot of water. Cotton also requires a lot of water to grow and to process, although it can be of great quality. But if you buy cotton look for quality cotton that will last a long time.",

Longevity of woven fabrics is based on a few factors:\n\n- Construction\n- Amount of usage \n- Care\n\nRegarding construction, simple weaves such as percale are the best to minimize the amount of rubbing yarns have on each other. Long staple cotton such as Supima and others help reduce fraying and pilling. And for longevity you want thicker yarns which means lower threadcount, with the best balance being 200-250TC. \n\nMarketing and consumer preference has let towards higher threadcount and weaves such as satin. They can feel very soft but ultimately won\u2019t be as durable as plain weave with stronger yarn. Now the market tends to be split between luxury less durable sheets and inexpensive sheets using poor quality yarn. I\u2019ve thought about launching a line of durable good quality sheets but it\u2019s a big investment and I\u2019m not sure that consumers would easily understand it without good marketing.",

It arrived and the sheets where literally like hessian sacks for horse feed. So horrible and itchy we couldn\u2019t even sleep on them. Ended up cutting them up for rags. Now trying to convince my wife not to keep buying ones from IKEA as we need to replace them all the time is going to be even harder!",

Remember fabrics shed from purchase so if your buying synthetic fabrics (polyster, nylon, pleather etc) fibres are entering the air in your home and we breathe those in. They also enter the water ways while washing and have been found in riverine fish gills. Microplastics are basically impossible to remove from the waterways at this point",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Many people like to just use up their employer matched funds or budgeted deposits in their HSA accounts and then switch to a normal credit card when the funds run out, however putting more money into the account and paying all eligible medical expenses through the HSA allows you to claim those deposits on your taxes at the end of the year. HSA is a \"pre-tax\" fund and if you put funds into the account after you've already paid taxes on them (i.e. from a bank account and not direct deposit from a paycheck), the US government will recognize that and refund the taxes paid on those deposits. \n\nI'm sure someone ITT will also love to tell you about investing with your HSA and the other things you can do with them, but I figured I'd keep it to a 100 level course today.",

I keep a spreadsheet of all my bills - what was charged, what I paid, what went into deductible and what I got reimbursed from the HSA.  \n\nThen when I get billed I pay with my credit card and go into my HSA account and reimbursed for it \n\nOne tip: sometimes you have to pay the doctor/hospital before the insurance decides what you have to pay or sometimes the insurance did it wrong and you have to work with them to get it right.  So I make sure that everything is done right first before asking for a reimbursement especially at the end of the year. Reason: one time I got reimbursed too much at the end of the year and then I had to fill out forms etc to make everything right.  It was a pain.",

It\u2019s the only account you can get where you don\u2019t pay taxes on the money you contribute, you don\u2019t pay taxes on the money you take our, AND you don\u2019t pay taxes on the gains made on that money. \n\nThis means you can put $500/mo in pre-tax money in for 30 years, invest it (usually once it hits over $1,000), earn 6% on it, and take out $500,000 tax free once you hit retirement age. \n\nIf you put that same $500/mo in a traditional 401k or IRA, you have to pay taxes when you take it out\u2026 turning your 500k into more like $350k-$400k. \n\nIf you want to use a ROTH 401k or IRA, you pay taxes on the money you put in, meaning the $500/mo you put in also costs you $100-$150/mo to the IRS. If you can truly only afford $400 in (to pay the $100) in taxes, it turns the future balance into $400k instead of $500k.",

That doesn\u2019t sound right.\n\nHowever, I have heard that you can save all your eligible expense receipts for years, even decades, and then withdraw in the form of reimbursements all at once. This gives those investments time to grow as you suggest.  I thought about doing this but I was worried I\u2019d lose receipts or something. But if you can simply withdraw tax free cash, I\u2019d stop using my HSA immediately. I\u2019m going to ask my CPA about this.",

The idea being to never pay health care costs out of it.     \n\n\nBut that is only applicable to people who max out all tax free investment options (i.e. retirement plans, etc).     If you have the ability to max out all retirement savings, and max out your HSA, AND be able to pay all medical bills outside of that, then you should do that.   \n\nBut most people are like me,  where medical bills (in the USA) are a struggle to pay, and maxing out all investment vehicles is  a pipe dream.\n\nPS:  I could bitch for hours about how utterly terrible health care costs are in the USA.

You then deduct the contributions when you file your taxes. The trade-off is that you will be paying FICA taxes on those contributions.\n\nAlso important to note that Social Security looks at your 35 highest earning years (inflation adjusted), so if you're really young or in a particularly low income year, the reduction in income might not make the list and won't have any impact.",

Otherwise it's a great tool for saving money on medical expenses, and if you have access to one, You definitely should make use of it, one way or another.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Some people think Europeans pay 25% sales tax or that Americans pay 8% VAT and this completely misinforms the conversation about the nature of prices.\n\nI saw several comments on a hardware sub discussing why prices are higher in Europe than in the USA and someone brought up the topic of tax.\n\nSales tax is a tax paid on the total amount of the sale. It is customarily not included in the price in the US because that makes goods seem cheaper. If sales tax is 8% and I sell you a widget that costs $100, then you pay me $108 and I remit $8 to the tax authorities. I keep the $100.\n\nVAT is a tax on the amount of \"value added\" to a product. It's usually included in the price of the goods. It is mathematically equivalent to this: If I sell you a widget that costs 100\u20ac but it only cost me 70\u20ac to make the widget, then I have added 30\u20ac in value to the widget. So if VAT is 25%, then you pay me 100\u20ac and I remit 25% of 30\u20ac to the tax authorities, which is 7.50\u20ac. I keep the remaining 92.50\u20ac.\n\nEdit: This is *largely* how the concept of VAT works. VAT schemes in various countries may have differing implementation details but this is the overall picture. This explanation is extremely simplofied and it's just for informational purposes. Consult local laws if you're running a business!",

Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp)\n\n(Technically the process is difference, because VAT is levied in a piecemeal way multiple times on a single product, at each stage of production, whereas sales tax is only applied once at the final sale to the consumer. But that's maybe too far down in the weeds, and basically doesn't change the tax paid overall anyway if we're talking about VAT vs. sales tax.)\n\nNote: this comment was edited for clarity.",

It doesn't actually make a mathematical difference for the consumer whether we're talking about a 10% sales tax or a 10% VAT. That's what you're totally incorrect about. The same amount ultimately gets collected as tax anyway, the only difference is when:\n\n&gt;Say, for example, a candy called Dulce is manufactured and sold in the imaginary country of Alexia. Alexia has a 10% VAT. Here is how the VAT would work:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Dulce\u2019s manufacturer buys the raw materials for $2, plus a VAT of 20 cents\u2014payable to the government of Alexia\u2014for a total price of $2.20.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. The manufacturer then sells Dulce to a retailer for $5 plus a VAT of 50 cents, for a total of $5.50. The manufacturer renders only 30 cents to Alexia, which is the total VAT at this point, minus the prior VAT charged by the raw material supplier. Note that the 30 cents also equal 10% of the manufacturer\u2019s gross margin of $3.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Finally, a retailer sells Dulce to consumers for $10 plus a VAT of $1, for a total of $11. The retailer renders 50 cents to Alexia, which is the total VAT at this point ($1), minus the prior 50-cent VAT charged by the manufacturer. The 50 cents also represent 10% of the retailer\u2019s gross margin on Dulce.",

Not because VAT is structurally terribly different from sales tax (as you just agreed it doesn\u2019t make a mathematical difference in the end), but because the rates are much, much higher in Europe. Typical sales tax is something like 5-6% in the USA, but more like 20-25% in Europe. That\u2019s a significant difference to the overall cost of goods at the end of the supply chain for consumers.

If I buy a locally made leather jacket in places like Florence where there is a history of leather making, maybe the jacket would be 200  euros.  If someone is importing leather jackets of lower quality, there's now a ceiling of 200 Euros on price... because if the jacket went beyond that I'd buy the higher quality jacket that's made locally.  So let's say they sell it for 130 Euros.  The local jacket may have a 50 euro profit, and the globally produced leather jacket might have a profit of 80 Euros, so the latter will be taxed more than the former. But in either scenario, the producer is not simply free to charge back that tax to the customer because there is competition over the price.\n\nThis is in practice meaningfully different than simply tacking a sales tax on at the end.",

Everyone pays the same rate so by definition, NO, it is not regressive.\n\nAlso since wealthier people do spend more on both necessities and luxuries they end up paying more in taxes.\n\nRegardless, the best of both worlds is the Fairtax, which is a sales tax on new items only combined with a \"Prebate\" that is sent to everyone in order to cover the taxes on ALL necessities.  This way those struggling do not pay ANY taxes at all.  In fact those who spend wisely and buy used rather than new items can actually make additional income from the \"Prebate\".  It is in fact, a progressive tax that encourages savings over reckless spending.  Personally, I would be fine with increasing the rate marginally and making the \"Prebate\" more like a UBI.\n\n[Fairtax.org](https://Fairtax.org)",

This means that it is a tax that is collected by the state via the companies from the customer (company or simple individuals). Depending on the status of the company, it will be paid to the state or not. Each country has different quotas, and it depends on the total turnover. In the EU, it goes from 0% to 25%, depending on the country. Each buyer, regardless if they are a company or a private person, will pay the VAT. \n\n\nExample (let's consider VAT 20% for easier calculation)\n\n1. You, as a company, buy a product at 10\u20ac and resell it to your customers at 20\u20ac. The VAT that you collect for the state is 4\u20ac. It is 20% of the full price.\n\n\n2. You, as a company, buy an item for your own use at 10\u20ac. It includes the VAT of 2\u20ac.\n\n\n3. You, as a private person, buy 10\u20ac worth of cupcakes. The VAT is of 2\u20ac and that's the tax collected by the seller for the state.\n\n\n\nNow, if you're a French company per instance, and your turnover exceeds 101 000\u20ac, you will be able to not only collect the VAT for the state but you can also deduct the VAT that you paid when you bought anything for your company. \n\n\nTherefore, if:\n\nSales 200k\u20ac --&gt; VAT collected: 40k\u20ac\n\nPurchases 100k\u20ac --&gt; deductible VAT: 20k\u20ac\n\nYou will have to \"pay\" the state:\n\nCollected VAT - Deductible VAT = 40k - 20k = 20k\u20ac",

VAT schemes differ from country to country and I provided an explanation of VAT in its absolute crudest and simplest form so people who live in non-VAT countries (like the USA) can quickly understand the rough idea of how VAT works.\n\nIn real life though, VAT schemes are designed to not only maximise revenue to the State while minimising economic impact from the tax but also to combat missing-trader fraud (although in some way the rebate is actually what enables missing-trader fraud) and to make accounting cleaner, which is why VAT implementations are almost never like I describe.",

Furthermore, VAT doesn't make accounting cleaner.

In short, 10\u20ac of value is added, and net VAT paid is equivalent to 20% of that 10\u20ac, or 2\u20ac. Even though this is not how it actually works, you arrive at the same result (2\u20ac) and it is easier to calculate and sufficient for a quick 10 minute explanation on the Internet to people who will likely never have to actually calculate, collect, and remit VAT.\n\nThe rules of VAT *are* designed, as much as possible, to combat fraud. I am not saying that is the *only* way fraud is combated, but that is *one* of the ways. Obviously, we wouldn't design a system where anyone could claim they paid anything for VAT and get a rebate, would we? So we don't. Some of the rules do exist to stop people from committing obvious fraud.",

No, it is not completely accurate. No, it is not sufficient to know only what I've said in the original post if you want to start a business in a VAT country.

    "postText": "Why YSK: This could save you from thinking you need to get a repair or to buy a new phone and ultimately, will save you $$$.\n\nIf your phone won\u2019t charge or you feel you need to hold the cord a certain way to get your phone to charge then check your charging port. There is probably some lint stuck in it.\n\nTurn off your phone and take a toothbrush with some isopropyl alcohol to brush your charging port (and speakers and buttons while you\u2019re at it). Then take a plastic toothpick to gently scrape the lint from the bottom of the port. Let the phone dry for about 15-30 minutes and BAM! Your phone will charge again.\n\nYou should probably do this on occasion anyway to keep your phone clean.",

They would think it was broken when all it was was a bit of lint in the way. We would bring it to the back and do exactly this. We used a small little paint brush thing to clean it out but a plastic toothpick works too. Just be gentle so you don\u2019t mess up the little pins inside.",

            "comment": "Another tip for this is use a non-conductive, thin object if you have one. Tooth brush and tooth picks are great options. If you happen to have those brushes that are used to clean trimmers, they are break because they are more rigid. Which is helpful for USB-C ports since they have a little less room for the bristles than Lightning adapters (iphone charge port). Also those disposal tooth flossers that have a sharp tip on the end are great because they can dig in very well.\n\nIf you need to beak up the material, isopropyl alcohol is perfect because the temperature at which it evaporates is low enough that you generally don't have to worry about it sitting around in/on your phone. Preferably 90% or above but 70% will do just fine (more commonly available than 90%). Just don't overdue it. While phones are more sealed now, there is a chance that liquid can get in your phone and stain your backlight. Use just enough to get in the port, literally just drops are needed.\n\nAnother option is compressed air. The ones with the little straw would be needed to get the air into the smaller area.",

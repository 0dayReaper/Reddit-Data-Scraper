    "postText": "Why YSK: A lot of folks use this site for their news, but with the upcoming blackouts and boycotts you may not know how to get news for days, weeks, or months at a time. You should know where to find news that is relevant and interesting to you. Below are some of my favorites to get you started:\n\n* [1440](https://join1440.com/) \\- they claim to be \"unbiased news\". I doubt that's possible, but they do a good job of bubbling up the most important new sources of the day.\n* Your local newspaper - no links here, but most cities/geos have local newspapers with free newsletters where they wills send you news of the day. Especially beneficial for local issues and weather.\n* [The Hustle](https://thehustle.co/) \\- A business and technology focused newsletter. Usually 2-3 well written articles on a few interesting topics. Very frontpage in their writing style and topic choices.\n* [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters) \\- Biased towards a NY audience they provide a pretty good US national view on the news and have several newsletters (most of them daily). It's a lot of the stuff you're used too here since so much gets posted from it.\n* [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/newsletters) \\- an alternative/supplement to the above, more focused on finance and technology. Their podcast, [The Journal](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal), is something I listen to daily.\n\nAs with all news, there's a lot of fearmongering, news stories about what *might happen* vs what *is happening,* and very little resolution to the issues discussed, but that's true everywhere. The above all provide free newsletters straight to your inbox that can give you insights to interesting stories of the day. Beyond that, every niche and industry has newsletters written for it from someone interesting who knows what they're talking about. Start digging and you'll likely find some good ones!",

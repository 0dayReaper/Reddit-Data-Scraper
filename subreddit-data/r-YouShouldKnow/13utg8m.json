I came across a website, \"[FlashMuseum](https://flashmuseum.org/)\" which allows you to run all the old flash games and animations using an emulator (you don't have to download anything, login or pay).\n\n\r  \nWhy YSK: Adobe tried killing flash, but the internet never forgets. You can find almost every flash game/animation ever created still archived, and this is a great starting point to find a lot of them.",

I'm learning the subject matter without formal course materials, so I try to test what I've read or heard in conversation in order to determine if I'm on the right track. \n\nIf \"coding that deployment system\" is the right/applicable lingo for this case, what language(s) would I need to know to accomplish the task? What kinds of tools, platforms, and materials would I need to possess or have access to? \n\nThanks again!",

Monkeys hate balloons. \n\n\nan ancient one I used to play all the time is something like \"Desktop Tower Defense\",  frankly I don't even remember the name.   You had a wide open space (i.e. your desk) and you would place towers anywhere.   So you made a maze out of it.  The key was to make two mazes, one up top, one on the bottom of your desk.  Then, when the things made it to end of the top maze, you blocked it off with a tower and make them go all the way back through the top maze then through the bottom maze.   Then open the top and block the bottom, sending them all through it again.  Repeat.\n\nEDIT: desktop tower defense is online.\n\nhttps://www.kongregate.com/games/preecep/desktop-tower-defense",

You had quite a few different towers and depending on how you placed those towers you would create a certain super tower. I also remember you could line up laser towers in a row to create a amplifier and have one laser tower shoot out a powerful beam. Was an incredibly addictive game.",

Some of the bigger ones got picked up by networks and then killed off before making an impact. I used to joke on the dudes that started Armor Games, because Miniclip was such a giant at the time, but looking back they were really smart to start their own platform off *the grounds of new.* After Adobe killed off Flash, they could easily have switched to Unity and now Unreal Engine, that's the benefit of not clinging on to a platform centered around a dying medium.\n\nAnd then Adobe created \"Adobe Animate\" which I just recently found out about and kinda pissed me off. Like a necromancer bringing a dude back to life that they murdered long ago.",

Only Firefox lagged this speciality &amp; needed Adobe &amp; even was very compatible.. Even their add-on had Adobe.. And after '21 flash did support many browsers.. But apple got popular &amp; they didn't tie up with Adobe.. So apple didn't support Adobe.. Even before '20 we used to need flash players or SWF to watch contents on YouTube &amp; on other sites too.. But HTML5 was introduced that used less resource &amp; efficiency in picture frames.. No dilusion.. So we don't need flash player.. Even the architecture of games has developed too.. Java applets has replaced it..",

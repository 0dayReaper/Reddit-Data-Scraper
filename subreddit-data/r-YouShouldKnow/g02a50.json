I honestly thought they were cute doing that, when I saw a few pics around. Turns out, something that looks so innocent can hide a big problem. The more you know!\n\nEdit: I want to point out that I'm not a vet or an expert, I'm just an owner. I stumbled upon this article casually but you also need to know that *any* behavioral change in your pet could be a cause of concern. Sometimes it can be head pressing, sometimes it can be associated to walking in circles, being aggressive or generally acting odd (which you, as the owner, will be able to tell better than anyone else). I'm replying to comments with what is my opinion but if you have any concerns, please get your pets checked up. It's better safe than sorry. I wish I could help you further but I don't have the knowledge to do it.\n\nI'm so sorry to all of you who experienced a loss of a pet, it's one of the worst things and nothing I can say could ever make it better. Just thank you for the love and attention you gave them while they were with us. You surely made their lives better.\n\nMuch love to you all and all your little friends!",

I think she just wants to play rough with him like a dog but knows she's not allowed to and needs to release that energy. \n\nAs far as the head against the wall thing goes, my dog I had as a kid did this because she had Alzheimer's.

We made a pit stop to stretch our legs and there were three goats.  A male a female and a kid ( I kid you not).  The male would push the other two every time my sister tried to feed them.  So I grabbed a handful of grass and lead the Male goat away.  Eventually he started eating grass on ground and I stopped feeding him.  I was reading a magazine and then immediately the male goat spots the female and the kid being fed and he bolts full speed at them and bashes into them.  Then he starts bucking his horns under them to flip them over. \n\nSo yes... damn goats.",

We realized we were wrong when my roommate came home to a note on our door from the sheriffs department saying the goats were spotted multiple times trotting around our small town and walking up and down the side of a busy main road. \n\nWe were shocked because every time one of us would come up the driveway the goats would come running up to greet us like they\u2019d been home and waiting for us, we never had any idea they were getting out at any point. They were smart enough to know our routines and what times we\u2019d leave for work and come home and they\u2019d come back every time before we were home. After that we had to spend a lot of time and money goat proofing that fence.",

                            "comment": "Usually, increased aggression in goats is caused by stress. But being a male, it can be other things.\n\n* How are your other goats acting? If they're acting differently as well (scared or aggressive), then something external could be upsetting all of them. Wild animals, or even people can cause this (I used to chase our goats as a small kid until I got ran over by an angry buck and learned my lesson).\n\n* Sick or injured goats tend to try to keep everything at a distance, so if you notice him looking under the weather, might need to get him checked out. \n\n* Some goats just get a bit grumpy as they age. If he's 8+ years old, he might just be doing his version of shaking his fist at the youngin's. Alternatively, if he's relatively young, he could be going through puberty.\n\n* Goats are hierarchical. If you've got more than one male, they can start trying to assert their dominance to be the alpha. Which includes headbutting anything and everything. If you don't have another male, he himself could be getting bullied by one of the females, or he's trying to test his dominance over you. You're a part of the herd, and you're the alpha, and he wants your spot.\n\nUsually the in fighting between goats will sort itself out once the pecking order gets decided. If it continues or gets bad, separate him from the herd for a week or two every time you see him do it. If he keeps having a go at people though, you need to address it. First try the usual loud noise (NO!) with large movement like waving them away. If that doesn't work, you need to put him onto his back and assert dominance like that. You flip the bastard onto his back and plant your feet right below his forelegs so he can't roll back over, and then you give him the loud NO!\n\nAt the same time, it could be none of these. Goats are weird, man. They have such varying personalities compared to most farm animals I've raised. You could've just rolled the dice poorly and gotten a goat that's a perpetual dick.\n\nEdit: [Found the perfect video detailing goat flipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jjIz-m5bpo)\n\nEdit 2: It's been ~10 years since I've lived on a farm, and damn this makes me miss it.",

I really, really thought I was going to have to put him down.  He had a slow recovery for the first few weeks and needed to be held up to eat and drink and needed help in the litter box.  But today he's able to walk almost normally (still drags his left rear leg a little) and can do almost everything by himself (we'll probably never trust him to go up and down the house stairs again, but he can use his cat stairs to the bed just fine.)  The amount of function he's regained in only a month is amazing.  We also ldiscovered that it was likely his blood pressure that caused the stroke and his medication has successfully lowered it, so hopefully it won't happen again.",

            "comment": "Guys I'm reading all the comments, I'm very glad I could help with an article I just casually found while Googling stuff about my dog.\n\nI'm also sorry for all of you who lost your pet after an episode like this. I know how heavy it is to lose our buddies, cats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, any animal!\nWe can try and give them the healthiest life we can, give them never ending love and make each day they are with us count but sometimes mother nature just works in mysterious ways and we can't prevent everything from happening (and this goes for everyone, not just pets) so please don't blame yourselves.\n\nI'm more than 100% sure they have been happy to spend their lives, even if sometimes too short, with you and that they're waiting for you on the other side of the bridge.\n\nGet them to the vet for regular checkups and don't forget to give them a big kiss on their little (or big) foreheads whenever you can.\n\nA big big hug from my big crew and I to you and all your best friends. (maybe drop a pic? I can't ever get enough of animals)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/nGfsdwl\n\n https://imgur.com/a/TaDnCNu\n\n https://imgur.com/a/OGsPINB\n\n https://imgur.com/gallery/C94oFw4\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/iwdjUZK\n\n https://imgur.com/a/kUOPAMK\n\n- Miele, Ofelia, Lola, Spike, Tarta, Paolo, Belfi, Tigra, Nera, Mamma, Ruggero, Ciccio, Pazza &amp; Dovah \u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "My cat died recently from a brain tumor. He was completely fine until the day off dinner when I noticed he wasn't eating. I found him stuck in the corner, he was having trouble breathing, was blind, and when i took him out and placed him on the ground he head pressed the first wall he walked into. Took him to the vet and he got put down. A part of me wishes he headpressed earlier, maybe I could've done something. But I'd rather believe he wasn't in any pain until the end of his last day. I fucking miss you buddy",

I was petting him while watching TV and he just laid down and I felt urine on the floor by my feet. He had a stroke in that moment and I didn\u2019t even realize till the pee got to my feet. Only comfort I have is knowing the little guy just wanted to be pet my be and licked me hand one last time when he was probably afraid.",

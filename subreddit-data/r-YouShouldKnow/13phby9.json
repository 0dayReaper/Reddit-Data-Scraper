While our house was still being built, the neighbor's Tom started coming down to piss on the solid cedar posts holding up my patio so the smell as soon as you walked out the house was overpowering. It was hard not taking it personally because that little bastard was having to walk over a quarter of a mile just to get to me.\n\nIt continued after we moved in, with me dogs who aren't fond of cats. Because I'm a pretty decent person, I'd check the back yard before letting my dogs out to prevent an incident. After I finally got sick of my backyard smelling like piss and having to check for cats in the middle of the night I just caught the little fucker and took it down to their house. I explained nicely that their cat was always on my back porch spraying my posts and I would appreciate it if they would not let it do that. That indignant cunt said we are out in the county so there's no leash laws and that's just what cats do.\n\nI told her that goes two ways and I would definitely not be checking my backyard before I let my dogs out.",

He was scarred and tattered from years of escaping predators himself, went deaf by 15 (likely as a result of exposure to loud farm equipment), and had access to only the cheapest dry cat food that my parents could find. The farm was also certified organic (meaning poison-free prey to hunt) and for most of his life, the road had been closed due to a bridge by the property no longer being deemed \"safe\", so very little traffic by the area for the better part of 14 years or so. We think he passed from being hit by a car once the road opened again since he couldn't hear them coming during his hunt, poor thing. He was an otherwise indestructible and loyal kitty who wouldn't even hurt a baby (human, specifically). Poke him while he's sleeping in the hay? He would startle and immediately get up as fast as he could for snuggles. He loved people. RIP Tom",

When we first moved to the UK we took in a pregnant stray, she once killed like 12 mice in one night, every single one of them she played with until they died of exhaustion or impact because she threw them really high. It was a bit disturbing, but we also had a really bad mouse problem so I guess it helped with that..  \n\n\nI would also prefer if domestic cats were kept indoors but unfortunately a lot of people here in the UK don't agree. I think at least there's more and more awareness of the benefits of keeping the cat indoors vs outdoors.",

The #1 most important thing that you can do though to help keep stray cat populations under control is to neuter or spay them, every one. A female cat alone can have a litter up to three times annually, which can range anywhere between 1-12 kittens at a time, of which can become successful hunters as early as 6 weeks old. A young female cat can then start reproducing as early as 4 months old, and continue the cycle. There are issues with stray cats in every community, so if you have the means of catching one to take to a local humane society, please do so. If a stray cat is not deemed to be adoptable, they fix and release them after (at least they do at the one where I've surrendered strays that I myself have caught).",

We start walking away and this cat thinks it has us on the run and it is following us hissing and going nuts. And I am shouting leave it commands at my dog as we keep trying to walk away but the thing keeps following us. We get two blocks away from its house and it is still pursuing us now from the center of the road. I am keeping my dog away, but am also shining my little flashlight at the cat  everytime a car gets close because it is a tiny thing in the road after dark and I would feel horrible if it survived its attempted dog attack only to get hit by a car.

She warmed up to us, had her kittens, and we have since just gotten used to having \"barn cats.\" \nFor the most part they just laze about the porch/barn/fields...they have cat food and bedding and a home here, just outside rather than in.  Do they still catch mice and voles and the occasional asshole squirrel?  Yeah.  But they're not wreaking havoc on the environment.  They're keeping home-invading species from getting too close, and they're sweet babies.  If anyone were to take it upon themselves to trap/euthanize our barn cats for \"the environment's sake\", they would be doing a disservice to more than just those cats.\n\n**FTR, we have spayed the females so they don't add to the population.",

Here's something you said  \"they love hunting and roaming around\" that's the problem they don't understand that they are killing hundreds of thousands of animals at an unsustainable rate, it is therefore the responsibility of an owner to not allow their pets to kill animals, barn cats aside. It is really that simple dude and arguing the opposite at all is to ignore reality my family has had cats consistently for nearly a century (I'm sure you have had plenty of barn cats too) I'm 28 and almost all of the tens of cats have no problem whatsoever being indoor cats.

Any conservationist worth their salt also believes that we can and must strike a balance between humans and natural systems because us humans have the higher mental faculties necessary to make executive decisions and affect great, coordinated change. We are able to act as the mechanism that tamps back our impact on natural ecosystems. Cats cannot do that, and can push through usual natural checks because no ecosystem--anywhere-- has the capacity for resilience against an effective, efficient, and numerous, non-native predator that did not evolve in concert with the native species. It's no fault of the cat, they're just following their biology. But it is a problem, like all our other problems, that people like you and I are responsible for fixing.",

Highly destructive, disease carrying mammals that will invade your home and yard and can cause thousands of dollars in damage. My rescue cat lived his first year on the street and as a result, he is an adept hunter. He hunts several rodents a week, and about 2 birds a year. That's a price I am willing to pay for fewer rodent infestations! Also let's face it, the birds getting killed by cats are not the strongest or smartest of the bunch, which is really just natural selection in action.  There are some extreme ecological situations, like small islands, that are exceptions, but for the most part, birds have plenty of space to live and not be threatened by cats. And a cat like mine cannot be kept indoors. We have needed to keep him in for other reasons in the past and he scratches and meows for a while, then he gets smart and lies in wait to run out the door at the first chance. I have children so this is a successful strategy for him. I do recognize that there are dangers to him that he would not face indoors, but as I wouldn't want to be kept in a prison for a longer life, I do him the favor of not keeping him in one either. He comes and goes as he pleases.",

One of our dogs did kill my pet gerbil and another gulped down a frog outside before we could stop him. \n\nI think that's one of my points- I don't hate dogs because they will hunt rabbits and other animals that I love. I just won't give my dogs the opportunity to do so. And even if I didn't care personally and there wasn't a law against it, I wouldn't allow my dogs to hunt wildlife in other people's yards and expect them to just accept it. \n\nSorry, I know you were asking a simple question and I went off into this big tirade.

People who come up with this act like this has only been a problem for some years. \n\nYeah, they do kill e.g. birds just for fun and certain species die out in certain areas because of that. It's not like that started 10 years ago. Cats have been with humans for some 1000 years and I'm sure this always applied. And they were free roaming most of the time. \n\nSo cats have been shaping wildlife around humans for thousands of years. Having indoor cats is a pretty new thing. Wouldn't be the opposite be true, you would change wildlife by locking up all cats? \n\nSo you're trying to resettle a certain kind of bird near an area where humans live and then you're upset cats - who live near humans - kill them. Just like it has been for a long time in history.\n\nAll right, but where do you draw the line? How many species get extinct because of cattle? And what about species that evolved into living in sense populated places, like your usual city pigeon. Why do we allow them to exist?\n\nAren't cats roaming around also part of the eco system?",

I went to pick up for this one lady who said she wasn\u2019t sure where her cat was, normally came around for food the same time each day or whatever but didn\u2019t for a couple days. Found her on her back porch curled up and dead. It was cold af that month too. I felt bad for her but could have been avoided if she would have just kept the damn cat inside!\n\nCo worker at that same job would always say \u201coh he looks like he was a mean little doggy\u201d every time we\u2019d get a smaller dog in. She also would almost daily tell me about how her sweet cat would bring her birds, other animal parts IN HER HOUSE and laugh about it.\n\nShe also told me a story one time about how her cat had killed and torn apart *several* baby rabbits.\n\nLike at that point, why even own the damn cat if you\u2019re gonna waste money on kibble and a collar if you don\u2019t want it to stay in your fucking house, while it chews up anything living it finds?? Not to mention that random cat shit and piss everywhere probably isn\u2019t great for the environment.\n\nWe have two cats, one of which is a rescue that we found outside when he was a kitten. Can\u2019t imagine letting them outside and stay outside. If we open the front door, he\u2019ll stare outside and then run away, my bet is that he likes it more inside.\n\nHow can you not worry if they\u2019ve been hit by a car? Or attacked by a stray dog or another cat? What if someone takes them and keeps them?\n\nJust keep your damn cat inside, Jesus fucking Christ",

We got her spayed and we feed her and let her in when she wants. She keeps rodents and other pests away from our house. We\u2019d guaranteed have field mice without her around the yard. \n\nI\u2019m so happy she chose us and domesticated us really. I never wanted a cat but now we love her. But we also understand she could have died that winter if we hadnt took her in a cleaned her up. And she doesn\u2019t deserve to be on stuck inside forever. Life is a balance for all.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: The fire department will come in and take readings. If windows are open, the readings could be incorrect. Thus giving a false sense of safety, all the while the home is filling up again. \n\nSo this happened to me yesterday. I was out and got a call from my SO. My first reaction was to tell him to get the windows all open and call the fire department. Well the fire department did instruct to close the windows for the reason provided above. It thankfully was a old malfunctioning detector. Might seem like a \u201cDuh OP\u201d moment. But we have a bunch of animals in the home as well, and in a moment of panic, sometimes the correct decision isn\u2019t what immediately comes to mind. Hopefully it helps someone.\n\nBonus tip: replace detectors after 7 years! \n\nStay safe everyone!\n\nEDIT: I deleted my last post due to my ignorance. I used CO2 (carbon dioxide) instead of CO (carbon monoxide).  CO2 is relatively safe vs CO is dangerous. I felt it\u2019s too important of a difference not to be 100% correct. Of course it was the damn title so completely not fixable. Thank you to those who caught the mistake so quickly!",

If you do, it might look like a white plastic rectangle at head height on a wall, maybe near a thermostat or smoke detector",

Get an alarm, not one of the colour changing ones, by the time you notice the colour has changed you're dead.\n\nPut it close to the gas appliance you want it to monitor, usually a gas boiler as they're infamous for making carbon monoxide if they're old/failing. That way it detects the carbon monoxide before it spreads to the rest of the house.\n\nYou can get combined smoke and carbon monoxide alarms as well.",

One could wonder if this is perhaps due to the fact that smoke detectors are so much more prevelant, and that they actually work. This is such a stupid fucking comment",

I was born and raised in south east asia, and we never had anything related to CO despite using gas appliances. The main difference I find between there and living here in America that makes this detector crucial here is ventillation. Where I was grown, the only time we closed our windows were when it was raining. Air circulation is never a problem there. Doors would be open most of the time as well. But here, opening windows are not common. Air circulation is mostly through air conditioning only and if weather is good, you may not have AC on. Doors are opened only when someone is coming in or going out.",

As soon as i replace the batteries he counts down to zero ppm within less than a minute and starts acting up again a couple weeks later. \n\nFirst time he did that startled the poop out of us.",

We got all of our animals into our car, called the utility company, and went to a local restaurant for breakfast. Turned out one of us had leaned against one of the burners the night before and turned it on just enough to set the sensors off by the morning. Still a dangerous situation and I'm grateful nothing happened,but we could have fixed it easily by turning the dang burner off and fully opening the windows. Nonetheless, always best to evacuate everyone and calll the utility company.",

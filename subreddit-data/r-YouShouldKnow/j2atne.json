    "postText": "Why YSK: I used to be a drain cleaner. EVERY SINGLE DAY I had people coming to me for a second opinion because they were told they had to replace their sewer line for 5 grand. In the two years I spent drain cleaning, I only came across a whopping FOUR people that actually needed their sewer line replaced and well over a hundred that were told they had to. Here are some of the many tactics these companies use:\n\n-The most common one is that they couldn\u2019t get their blades past a blockage so the line must be broken. If this were true, the blades would come back with either mud on them, or completely clean and shiny. Even then, there are lots of other reasons why they could be shiny so it\u2019s not a definite break in the line.\n\n-They clean the line with small or sometimes even no blades. If it\u2019s the mainline, at least 3 inch blades should be used. Preferably 4 inch though. But some companies don\u2019t do that. So they will poke a hole into the blockage, and everything will run just fine...for a few days. Shortly after, that tiny hole will close again and you\u2019ll call them back out. They\u2019ll try to convince you it\u2019s because the line is broken when it\u2019s not.\n\n-They make you think roots in the mainline are a huge deal and the line must be replaced. Roots are the most common cause of sewer line backups. It\u2019s incredibly common and should be expected if you have a tree near your sewer line. Some people will go ten years before their first root caused backup because it can take time for the roots to get through the pipe. Your sewer line is still in good shape. Just get it snaked every year and use root killer to slow the growth. \n\n-They scope the line and find bellies with sitting water or small offsets. While not ideal, most houses have them and it\u2019s not necessarily a big deal. It\u2019s something to keep an eye on, not waste 5-10 grand on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s some general tips regarding the trade:\n\n-If the company doesn\u2019t have the prices online, don\u2019t tell them if you\u2019re renting out the house. If you\u2019re a landlord they\u2019ll assume you\u2019ve got extra cash and up charge you.\n\n-If your basement has a floor drain, get a $10 water alarm. If it ever backs up, you\u2019ll know immediately and stop the spread of water before it causes massive amounts of damage. This is particularly important if you don\u2019t go into the basement often. I once went to an elderly lady\u2019s house that had a foot of water in the basement. She was too old to go downstairs and didn\u2019t notice the smell because she was hooked up to an oxygen tank thingy. Decades of memories stored in boxed were destroyed. \n\n-If you have a sewer line scoped, make sure you see them do it yourself. They like to swap footage with another house and act like your line is broken. Also make sure they use at least 3 inch blades on your mainline. Also make sure to get a copy of the footage. You can send it to multiple companies and they\u2019ll usually give you their opinion for free so you don\u2019t need it scoped multiple times!\n\n-Clean out the p-traps to your sinks. I\u2019ve had dozens of people call me to spend five minutes unscrewing their trap, cleaning it out, the putting it back. When I try to tell them that it\u2019s easy to do yourself they say they don\u2019t mess around with anything plumbing related. But seriously, watch a two minute video and do it yourself in 5 minutes and save a hundred bucks. \n\n-DO NOT FLUSH ANYTHING DOWN THE TOILET UNLESS IT CAME OUT OF YOU, OR ITS TOILET PAPER!!!! It doesn\u2019t matter if your wipes say they\u2019re \u201cflushable\u201d. it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u201cjust a few tampons\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter if you \u201cdidn\u2019t think your kid was dumb enough to flush his cat stuffed animal\u201d. Don\u2019t do it! Just because it gets past the toilet doesn\u2019t mean it gets through the whole line. If you\u2019re flushing wipes or tampons, there\u2019s a good chance your just collecting them and one day you will be met with a very unpleasant surprise. I\u2019ve seen anywhere from a couple tampons clogging the line to filling up HALF OF A FIVE GALLON BUCKET with tampons. The only thing worse than spending 10 hours fishing for tampons is spending a thousand bucks for someone to fish for your tampons. \n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to it but I\u2019m doubtful many will even read this. Which is a shame because I saw people getting scammed every single day and it\u2019s easily avoidable. Most people don\u2019t know much of this and these companies know that. And they take advantage of it.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, don\u2019t use any draino or anything similar. It\u2019s very acidic. It can melt away pipes overtime and does a very poor job anyways. It usually only pokes holes into things. Save your pipes and clean out the trap yourself by hand, or call someone to do it.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend never using a snake yourself for the mainline, or even really a kitchen line. I have no idea how places like Home Depot are allowed to rent them out to just anyone. I know people that were trained to use them and still lost a finger. If you\u2019re not incredibly familiar with it you can go from being just fine to missing a finger in literally a split second. Spend the extra hundred dollars and have a professional do it. It takes a long time to be trained to use it and messing up or not knowing how to use it properly can cost you a finger or two.\n\nAlso, if your toilets start to bubble/gargle when you run any water, your line is most likely going to be backing up. You could have a backup in one minute, or in a week. It\u2019s best to have someone out ASAP!\n\n\nPeople are asking why you shouldn\u2019t use the snake yourself or how I could cause a lot of damage. [This is why. BE WARNED, THIS IS NSFW AND GOREY. And this isn\u2019t even the worst that can happen!](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/ibdelp/got_a_piece_of_my_pinky_finger_ripped_off_by_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAlso, drain cleaners love kitchen sink disposals because it keeps them in business. The more food you put down, the more likely it will get clogged. Especially avoid greasy foods, egg shells, and coffee grounds. If you\u2019d like to avoid a backup, don\u2019t put any food down the sink and use a paper towel to wipe off excess grease on dishes!\n\n\n\n\nAs much as I would love to, it has become impossible to keep up with all of these comments! If you have a question, I\u2019d recommend saving this post and then messaging me in a day or two! Thanks for all of the awards! I hope this post can help you save some money and make scammer companies lose some business!",

The best thing to do would be call a plumber to come clean out your drains but if its still working fine and money's tight or you just don't want to pay for that when its not absolutely necessary then I don't see why it couldn't wait until later. The main thing is to not continue doing it and creating a bigger problem whenever it does get cleaned out.",

If it's a newer home with a pvc sewer line or you lnownthat the house has never had roots in it then most likely the tampons or wipes have just flushed through to the main. Wipes and tampons on their own are not really a problem, but they don't break down like toilet paper does. So if you have roots then they will catch on the roots and cause the sewer to plug up much sooner than it normaly would.",

There are charts on the DEPs website about how frequently you should have your tanks pumped based on your household size and tank size.

The only good thing about that company was that rep.  I'm glad the both of you have real hearts and recognize that you're dealing with real people on the other end of the phone.",

I called John Moore (they had all those great commercials) because our home had been empty for a year+ before we moved in and the drains were backing up into the bathtubs. It was gross, I had no idea what to do.\n\nThey wanted to charge me $20,000 to replace the drain because it was \u201cbroken\u201d  and needed to be repaired. They would bust through my patio to fix the repair. The $20,000 didn\u2019t cover the cost to repair the patio just the plumbing. They had guys who were \u201cnearby\u201d and could get on it today but weren\u2019t sure when they were available to come back if I didn\u2019t book right then, there was a lot of pressure to sign right away so that I wasn\u2019t stuck with my \u201cbroken drain\u201d for who know s how long.\n\nI then called the people who installed the drain. It was under a \u201clifetime warranty\u201d so they clearly had no interest in trying to replace it. They snaked it through the outlets on the roof and it was fine for years until we  ended up moving. That experience made me so distrustful of anyone\u2019s quotes but proved to me it\u2019s always worth getting a second opinion.",

I asked my insurance company about sewer line coverage and they stated they just started putting US$20k of coverage on their policies by default.  Saved my ass because pretty recently the line actually *did* have to be replaced.  Luckily, they were able to sleeve the clay-croc instead of a full replace (sewer, water, and gas lines were \"shelved\" on top of each other so replacing the sewer line would have required shutting off the gas from the nearest station as well as the water, just in case) but if I didn't have that policy I would have been out at least $10k.",

I've fixed everything from my stand alone A/C, to fridge, sink, toilet with pretty much 0 knowledge and most of the work was unscrewing some shit and then screwing it back in.  Also sometimes you just gotta give things like a panel a little force to get shit off if it was screwed in, because it might have some small latches.\n\nThink about it this way. Maintenance guys are 't paid because they are geniuses, they get paid because of labor. If you can put together legos or kinects you can take care of most of the stuff yourself. Plenty of YT videos and info online.\n\nJust the other week our new fridge was making some noise and the fan was being loud.  My fiancee and I figure out it was too cold and realized there must be some Ice by the fan. So unplug it, melt the ice with hair dryer.  Still some chuncks, so my fiancee asks \"how do we get rid of that?\" I said \"I don't know but there are two screws on this back panel, if we unscrew it probably could the chunks out\". She says \"I don't know are you sure?\". I said \"They wouldn't put two screws there if it wasn't meant to come off.\"  Sure enough, take out screws, take panel out, take chunks of ice out, put panel back on with screws, good to go.",

Just remember even if you have to spray and check 2 or 3 times, it's still probably a lot less TP than you used before and you really should feel cleaner.\n\nMy guess is your angle is off and pressure is too low.

She was around 70 and she thought her shit didn\u2019t stink. And let me tell you as someone who actually smelt it, it smelt like shit . Her toilet in the basement was backing up and she insisted that it wasn\u2019t her fault (even though she lived alone). I hated her from the moment I met her. Should wouldn\u2019t stop saying how important she was and wouldn\u2019t take her eye off me.\n\n I was always very clean, but she pissed me off. As always I put a long carpet down the stairs to make sure nothing wipes onto the carpet. I put a tarp on the tile in the bathroom and another mat on the tarp. I carefully removed the toilet making zero mess. I cover the snake with a wall thing to make sure nothing goes flying any where. \n\nThe entire time I do this, this absolute prick of a woman is yelling at me as if I was the one who flushed my \u201cluxurious and expensive wipes\u201d down her toilet and clogged it. I made no fucking mess whatsoever yet she wouldn\u2019t stop yelling at the mess I made even though it was her poop that spilled out of the toilet that I even cleaned up! \n\nEventually she calls me an ignorant sewer pig. A couple minutes later I \u201cconveniently\u201d discovered the line was broken. I pulled my cable back and referred her to a company. She\u2019s yelling at me this entire time insisting it\u2019s not, but she still called the company I referred her to. Long story a bit less long, I got a referral bonus of $500 for getting her to replace the line. \n\nTo an extent, I feel bad for lying even though I had pulled up some wipes and know there were more that caused the backup. I could have spent a few more minutes and fixed it. But Bethany had to keep going and so she had the \u201cluxury\u201d of spending 10 thousand dollars to fix her sewer line that wasn\u2019t broken. But I never scammed anyone else. Even then, I didn\u2019t do it for the money. I did her because of not her bitch and she deserved nothing less.",

I've had 4 different plumbers out and not ONE alluded to just cleaning it out as even a less-then-optimal option. I didn't even know that was a thing, and they sure weren't going to let on. So pissed right now and THANK YOU.",

It's better to put it down a sink or tub drain and pushing it down with just enough water to get it through the trap. Flushing it might just be sending it straight out to the city when these products need to sit in your pipe generally overnight to work best.",

Usually it has some sort of tip that can punch though, cut, or snag clogs as it travels.\nMotorized ones can put a lot of mechanical power down the line of the snake. Getting something snagged on it could mean that something gets all twisted around. Springs can behave in unfamiliar ways - especially when they're under load - and a long sping that's spinning with substantial torque and suddenly jumps or twists in an unexpected way may take a finger with it.\nI'd like to know more about good handling practice with a mini rooter.",

If you don't have the right gloves and are not experienced and you grab the cable as it's spinning you can get your hand/glove caught in the cable. You need leather gloves, sometimes with metal in the palm area, to keep you from gripping the cable while you're guiding it in the drain (the cable needs to spin in your hand without catching your glove if that makes sense) Without experience and the panic of having your hand caught it's difficult to turn it off and put it in reverse before causing injury.",

I undid the portion that connects to the sink drain, poured draino down there. Poured some draino into the reservoir. Waited about 5 minutes, then set the dishwasher to drain. Sure enough a solid plug worked it's way up the hose and out into a container I had ready. Felt pretty damn good when I ran the next load and everything worked right!",

All I know is it can fuck with pipes and make them weaker or if the line is already in bad shape, it can poke holes in it. That\u2019s especially bad if the holes are inside your walls and start to leak. It also doesn\u2019t do much for the clog. As I\u2019m sure everyone that uses it know, it doesn\u2019t take long for the clog to start up again. I recommend cleaning it yourself if it\u2019s in the trap, or have it snaked out.\n\nEdit: most companies also charge an extra $50 or so if they can tell draino or something similar has been used lately. It really irritates the skin when you come into contact with it. Even though they charge extra, please tell them you used it even they\u2019re about to snake it. It\u2019s good to know beforehand because you get sprayed with it as you pull your cable back. If they know it\u2019s in there, they can take proper precautions and put on glasses. I personally didn\u2019t charge extra to those that told me beforehand. But nothing was more annoying than spending the rest of the day itchy because I got some sprayed on me and it could be dangerous if it gets in your eyes.",

We normally try to address minor house issues ourselves, but some online research indicated this was beyond our abilities.      \n     \nMy point being - your post made me realize how fortunate we were to get an honest plumber after hours on a Sunday who did the right thing and advocated for us with the county. Also fortunate to live in a place where my tax dollars pay for after hours and weekend county emergency water services that corroborated the diagnosis at 11pm and then fixed it in 24 hours.       \n     \nThanks for the education! Beneficial post!",

            "comment": "Hi guys! I'm a plumber and my shop focuses on service. That does include cleaning drains, both internal and main. This post is pretty on point, except for a couple things. First, roots can be a big issue. While OP is correct that it takes a long time for them to really get bad, if your house and plumbing is older than 10 years, chances are roots have snuck into the joints of the PVC, or eaten into non PVC/iron pipes. We will recommend a replacement if the roots are bad, but if it's a minor clog we'll tell you to get it snaked once a year or so and save up to replace it later on. \n\nSecond, standing water in your pipes is worse than OP is saying. It can cause sludge buildup, which causes a lot of clogs. However, the solution is to just adjust the pipes to have the correct angle, or fall for gravity to take that water out of there. \n\nThird, most actual plumbing shops won't post our prices online. It's not that we want to scam you, it's just that we charge time and material, so we have no way of knowing a price until we see the problem. That being said, we usually charge labor to do a simple drain snake. \n\nBeyond that, OP is right on the money. If you DO use cleaning chemicals, please tell us! If that stuff is lingering, it can seriously injure us when we get in there. Additionally, pour hot used pasta water down the sink once a week. It helps keep your kitchen lines free of grease. My co-worker swears by it and he's never had an issue. And, yeah. Don't use a machine without knowing how it works. I've lost skin off my palms doing it. If you do use a machine, wear heavy work gloves and pay attention. Oh, and if you get a line scoped, do watch! It's pretty cool and being able to show you possible problems helps us out a lot.",

                    "comment": "Advice for anyone with an older home: \n\nYou need to shop very carefully for a plumber and skip just calling the Rotorooter guys (or the equivalent in your area). \n\nI have a nearly 100 year old house that had a mix of the \"nested bell\" style of terracotta and cast iron drain pipe pieces you're talking about. The local Rotarooter place sent out a new guy who was way too much of a novice for an old house. Because of some errors on his part coupled with the age of the drain line, the entire drain line ended up totally fucked (terracotta pieces shattered and collapsed, the cast iron damaged, etc.) \n\nMy advice is three fold: \n\nTo echo what I said above: shop around for an experienced plumber. \n\nHave that plumber come over *before* you have problems. It's worth paying to have the drain scoped, cleaned, and to get a professional opinion from a qualified plumber and not some ass clown from Rotorooter. \n\nFinally, if you do need to replace the drain... shop around to see if you can find a reasonable \"trenchless\" option to deploy before your old line is too damaged to avoid digging up your whole yard. \n\nTrenchless \"pipe lining\" jobs can often cost a little more than a trench job *but* when you factor in all the other costs (like restoring your front yard, the landscaping, and the city sidewalk that was damaged in the process, or whatever) it usually ends up being a lot cheaper.\n\nSome people have strong opinions about going the lining route instead of the total replacement route, but given what a goddamn mess my total removal and replacement was... I wish I'd even had a chance to try out the liner method instead of the cluster fuck I dealt with.",

If the basement is unfinished  you could easily see where it is. \n\nIt\u2019s relatively uncommon for them to scam you when it comes to kitchen sinks so I would t worry much unless they try to say the line is broken. If they do, then call another company and then try to get a refund. \n\nIf you want a warranty, don\u2019t tell them you put anything down the drain. Say that you scrape all food into the trash and don\u2019t put any grease down the drain. At least pretend you don\u2019t if you do these things. There is a chance of them being able to tell if they pull stuff back up on their cable. In that case you probably won\u2019t get a warranty or will be limited to a 30 day one instead of the usually 90.\n\nFoods like eggshells, coffee grounds, and anything greasy will build up overtime.

Sometimes you need to use a large jetter to Hydro Scrub the lines. Sometimes just using a product like Root-X will fix the problem (even if only for a year or so) and YES sometimes the entire line needs to be excavated and replaced, and often depends on the material of the pipe and the landscaping around it. If you have old cast iron lines they often times will rot out at the bottom, allowing for sewage to seep into the ground (not always!) and allow for an easy build up of grease, sludge, and waste.  This would be a reason to have a sewer line replaced, (although often you only need to replace a portion)\n\nLikewise, if you have PVC lines that have developed a belly, a break or crack, or has multiple root penetrations it is recommended that you have replace a portion of the line, and if possible reroute it away from trees with aggressive roots.\n\n\nI am a third generation Master Plumber, and have been running our family company for years.

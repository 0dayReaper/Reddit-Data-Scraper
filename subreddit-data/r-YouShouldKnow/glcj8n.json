    "postText": "Just because you have been with someone for what may be a considerable length of time doesn't mean you shouldn't leave. If a person is being abusive, the relationship has changed, or if you're simply not happy, just leave. If you've worked to remedy the problem and it isn't working, it's okay to leave. And it's okay to feel like you're starting over and it's going to hurt. It's going to feel like a complete waste of time. Thats fine. Use it as a learning experience for self growth. \n\nSource: Left a relationship of 8 years and didn't want to be in it for at least 2 years. Best decision of my life was to leave.",

I know some posts here will say the opposite .. maybe go to a psychologist together etc, but I want to thank you for saying this, and having it pop up in my feed this Sunday morning. It helps. I miss him, but I dont miss what we didnt have in common and how he talked down to me like a child. Be well, all of us :)",

It's not... You can resent and hate everything about someone and even the thought you getting back together makes you sick, but still miss them.\n\nIt might sound corny and I don't know how obvious this is, but I'd never realized it or heard of it  before.. and I read  it a time when I really needed to hear it.",

It was only when he knew he was losing me, that things began to change, and by then it was too little, too late. He wasn't changing out of love for me, he was changing out of selfishness, because he didn't want to get hurt.\n\nAfter I left him, it seemed like no one understood that I was hurting too. Or they thought, as my ex still does, that if I loved him, I'd still be there, or I'd want to work on it more. I spent 9 years working on it, and all anyone sees is the end, when he finally put in some effort to take my thoughts and feelings into consideration.\n\nSorry for the rambling.

Just having a B.A.-level understanding of accounting, finance, game theory, macro- and microeconomics, behavioral economics, portfolio theory, etc., makes it much easier to recognize common mistakes people make in their lives, not just with money but with their decision making processes generally. It helps order your thinking and recognize situations where making mistakes are likely so you can slow down and reconsider. I'd highly recommend that people who are able take more classes about it.",

Really easy reads, not too technical, still insightful and interesting. If you want something a little more technical and specifically about game theory, just start by following the rabbit hole of the John Nash Wikipedia page. A personal hero of mine, Nash was sort of the father of modern economic game theory. There have been lots of economics papers written about game theory that you can find, the most foundational will probably linked in the sources of the Wikipedia page.",

Accepting something is a failure and moving on is actually a better use of any sunk costs than sticking with a sinking ship, especially when you can use what you learned about the failed project to do it better the next time around.",

Indeed, pro teams are usually pretty ruthless about getting rid of an overpaid player as soon as the contract makes it feasible. Or at least persuading him to restructure his contract, under the threat of being cut if he refuses.\n\nSource: played dynasty fantasy football for a decade",

I did everything I could to help them (hours upon hours of long phone calls of empathetic listening, driving hundreds of miles to visit them and check up on them, buying them meals, doing their chores for them, encouraging therapy or meds or AA, etc). Didn't matter because they didn't want to change ultimately and they both became awful, manipulative, emotional vampires bc they got so warped by their suffering. Nothing you can do about it if they do not want to change. My life became so much better without them poisoning it.",

But after a couple years of fighting, emotional disconnect, and emotional infidelity the other party finally said we need to not be in a relationship. He actually thought we could stay in the same house. I left. Best decision and sleep of my life that night. Unfortunately I still didn't want it to go away and said I'd have kids with him. Thankfully he didn't hold me to that and left anyways. \n\nIt's so much better. I have another relationship now with someone who does not want more kids. I find situations all the time where I get defensive because I expect to be attacked, because of my previous relationship. I'm realizing it was emotionally abusive and manipulative. And my current partner helps me realize when that is happening and works through it with me.\n\nI'm so much happier, and so much more myself.",

We never argued or had counseling to workout whatever issues she felt we/she had.  I never did not love her.  We had just taken a vacation with our kids last summer that was awesome.  We moved out of state 8 years ago for her career and I quit my job to stay at home and raise our two boys.  She literally replaced me with him in the blink of an eye.  She threatened to call the cops on me when I said I wasn\u2019t leaving.  I went to a hotel to not cause a scene in front of our kids and because she \u201cneeded space to think\u201d after I told her I wanted to go to counseling and figure all this out.  That I still love her.\n\nAs soon as I had left the guy she\u2019s been having an affair with rolled up to the house and spent the night under our roof with our kids.  My neighbor told me and I found out as much for myself when I tearfully FaceTimed the boys that night to tell them I love them and I\u2019d be seeing them again soon.  I\u2019ve been at our house every day since watching them while she is at work with this guy because I love my kids and I\u2019m going to take care of them.\n\nI\u2019ve just realized typing all this that I\u2019m the one who is living the sink cost fallacy.

And if you aren't willing to try, then that says more about the state of the relationship than anything else, and means you certainly should leave. But if you're debating it?

If all they've ever really heard about is you complaining about things going wrong and you haven't ever shared the good things about the relationship with them, their advice is almost certainly flawed from the start. The whole \"you should always be happy and your partner should always make you happy\" idea is toxic and entitled. \n\n2) If theyve never been in a relevant relationship lasting longer than 2 years, take their relationship advice with the largest grain of salt you can. Their relationship ideals most likely are founded on the media they consume and won't exactly be great for real life applications.",

All relationships have ups and downs, and require real effort from both parties to be successful. Before ending a relationship, consider what it means to you, and if you are willing (or even able to) do what it takes to improve it. \n\nOf course, there are lines that should not be crossed. A partner that is abusive, unfaithful, or unwilling to put in the effort totally changes the equation. You may seek deep counseling, but there is no fault at ending the relationship there.",

            "comment": "And it doesn\u2019t matter what the relationship is complicated by\u2014kids, house, whatever. It will be a longer and more difficult process but your happiness is worth that effort. Not every relationship is fixable, or should be fixed, and there comes a point where the effort you\u2019d have to expend to save it isn\u2019t worth it. And you can\u2019t make someone into a different human being\u2014which goes for yourself and your partner. You both deserve to be happy! (Unless your partner is a total shithead. Then you just deserve to be free of them.) Divorce can be rough on kids at first, but ultimately I think kids benefit from seeing their parents make emotionally mature decisions, discuss feelings proactively, and not be stuck in a constant battle. If divorce lessens conflict and gives the kids happy parents, it ultimately gives them a calmer life. (There have been studies saying this but I can\u2019t remember what they were.) I\u2019m sure that if my parents had divorced when I was young I\u2019d have been a hell of a lot happier. \n\nPersonally I\u2019ve found that having no partner is better than the wrong one, at least right now. When I think what my \u201cshelter in place\u201d life would\u2019ve looked like with my former partner, I feel depressed and panicky just thinking about it. It was a very hectic and stressful time at work at the beginning, and the guy wouldn\u2019t have been supportive at all. \u201cGuess I\u2019m cooking dinner fOr MySeLf again, huh? What are you really doing, because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not really working all these hours?\u201c Then when I DID get home I\u2019d see the tumbleweeds everywhere and socks all over the place and crap everywhere. Compared to dealing with that, being by myself has been a fucking dream. Sometimes it gets lonely, but being a little lonely by myself in an apartment that\u2019s pretty close to the one I dreamed of when living with my ex, sure beats being a LOT lonely with a messy, passive-aggressive schlub.",

Ending the relationship with one was one of the most difficult things I've ever done. \n\nThey stole two thousand dollars from me and hid it for a year. I finally confronted them because I caught them hitting on my female friend, when they had a girlfriend and told me multiple times they had no intentions toward this female friend. I told them to start confessing because I didnt know who they were anymore.\n\nThey put up a large victim facade, said they were on hard times, blah blah blah anything to seem powerless and appeal to my sympathy. It worked for about 4 months, as I tried to be patient and talk it out to find a way to have them pay it back and get them on their feet. \n\nI wanted to believe I mattered to them, that my forgiveness and help would make a difference. After all they were a single father with a crazy baby mother. Even if my friend was a scumbag now, I thought he should be given my help for his 5 year old son's sake.  \n\nDuring this 4 months of trying to salvage our friendship they became hard to reach, spent their money on drugs, media (games, movies), and fast food. They continued to not seek out a better job (they worked in fast food for 12+ years), get a vehicle, clean their house, and neglect their kid. Meanwhile throwing parties, staying up all night playing games and smoking/drinking, and lying to me over petty things. Avoiding me and responsibility and showing no change in behavior, but talking a good game.\n\nEventually I ran into a friend whom this person had screwed over in the past. They used to be best friends but my friend slept with this guys girlfriend while he was living with them and knocked her up...the 5 year old of my former friend is the child. I learned that before the fallout of finding out about the cheating the exfriend of mine stole three thousand dollars from this guy and his family by stealing debit/credit card information. They didnt charge him since the guy was devastated by his girlfriend's choices and just wanted to move on. \n\nWhen I learned that my former friend had stolen before I confronted him again and he denied it. The other guy was good enough to keep the records of the fraud case he never pursued and showed me before, so I caught former friend in another lie. I ended the relationship then and there. \n\nTime in a relationship is not important, its the quality of the relationship. If I had put all the memories and nostalgia aside and looked at the former friend's behavior and not their words...I would have come to the conclusion quicker. Sure I knew this person very well, but despite that I avoided seeing the truth about them because I didnt want to lose them, admit I was tolerating a scumbag, accept I was a fool to be their friend. I was codependent because they had always been in my life, but not because they made an effort, just because I always made excuses and allowed them to be. \n\nThankfully I've grown and learned more about myself from this. It led me to weed out many other relationships from my life.",

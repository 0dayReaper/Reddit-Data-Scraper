    "postText": "Why YSK: It's a common misconception that just because you consume animal products you don't need to take B12 supplements. B12 isn't produced by animals, but is synthesised by a bacteria and archaeon. Farm animals need access to soil (cobalt) in order to produce this bacteria, which means that in many cases they themselves are injected with supplements. Combined with the facts that protein bound B12 is harder to absorb by the human body and that fruit and vegetables are sanitised before they reach your table, you may very well not be getting the recommended amount of B12. This is regardless of what kind of diet you are on, although vegan and vegetarian diet can put you at higher risk.\n\nFactors such as age and health also play a role in how much B12 our bodies absorb. Non protein bound B12 like is found in supplements are easier to absorb and may be beneficial to battle deficiency.\n\nIf you struggle with low energy and feeling tired you may need to check you B12 levels.\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://med.libretexts.org/Courses/Dominican_University/DU_Bio_1550%3A_Nutrition_(LoPresto)/7%3A_Vitamins/7.3%3A_Water_Soluble_Vitamins/Vitamin_B12_(Cyanocobalamin)\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/73/2/106/1820655\n\nhttps://www.agric.wa.gov.au/livestock-biosecurity/cobalt-deficiency-sheep-and-cattle#:~:text=All%20ruminants%20(including%20sheep%2C%20cattle,vitamin%20B12%20deficiency%20in%20livestock.\n\nEdit: word\n\nEdit 2: Since this gathered a bit of traction, it's worth pointing out the information that has been shared in the comments and have legitimate sources.\n\n20% of people over the age of 60 suffer from B12 deficiency. This number is lower for younger people (6% for men and 8% for women). As we age our bodies struggle more with absorbing B12 and anyone over the age of 50 should be mindful of this. Numbers are from the US.\n\nThe main culprits of B12 deficiency are pernicious anaemia, pregnancy, and age. This does not mean people who don't fit that criteria can't suffer from B12 deficiency. It just means you are at lower risk. People who primarily adhere to a vegan or vegetarian diet are at risk as well. People who don't eat a healthy, varied diet are at risk as well.\n\nB12 deficiency and culprits differ between countries. Children in Nepal are at higher risk than children in developed countries.\n\nB12 is a water-soluble vitamin. This means you pee whatever the body doesn't need. There has been no research showing cause and effect relationship between taking too much B12 and health issues.\n\nB12 deficiency may cause symptoms such as anxiety and depression.\n\nHope this helps",

So the forgetfulness and collecting cans to keep track was something we assumed he'd just do when drunk. Doesn't help he doesn't communicate unless drunk and ready to verbally abuse\n\nAnyways, one day he collapsed. Outright couldn't walk. Legs were dead. It was like suddenly paralysed even though he still could feel his limbs\n\n#-----------\n\nTurns out he forgot to eat.\nNo breakfast, no lunch, we force him to eat dinner.\n\nAnd straight up beer. Just beer. He gets the calories to work but nothing else. And the alcohol depletes the B12\n\nSo after 2 months of vitamin B, he is able to walk on his own. He has the strength but just lost the juice in his nerves to use the muscles\n\n#------------\n\nThat being said,\n\n#vitamin B smells like shit.\n\nOk more like piss. It's the thiamin in B1, since it has sulfer, and over time some gets released. **So becareful of how you store them**",

Nitrous oxide, the psychoactive chemical, actually renders some of your B-12 inaccessible to your body AND prevents you from effectively absorbing/\"digesting\"B-12 for a duration after using. \n\nI learned this after taking care of a suburban 40 year old mom who got paralyzed within 5 minutes of her most recent use of Whippit's, while at her daughter's birthday they were hosting at their home. Came in unable to meaningfully move her limps, just some slight muscle tone with twitches of fingers or her foot. Weirdly enough, she seemed to be breathing well, so it wasn't affecting all muscle/nerve types.  \n\nThe body is wild and scary\n\nedit - should've mentioned with IV B12 and corticosteroids (that's all I remember pertaining to her paralysis, other meds for other issues) she was able to start moving, albeit weakly within the 8 days I saw her.

The term is usually used in reference to pollutants (hence why pregnant women are generally fine eating tuna but should avoid large predator fish like shark, swordfish, or king mackerel) but ot also applies for other molecules like omega 3. You are right that getting omega 3 from algae or seaweed would be much more environmentally friendly but it's cheaper to let nature concentrate it for you so that's why getting it from fish is the norm.",

Don't panic about that, because the amount is so miniscule that it can't hurt you.  That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news is, it isn't useful in that form.  Your body must convert it by removing the cyanide and replacing it with something else.  Also your liver can only store methylcobalamin, not cyanocobalamin.  Your kidneys will attempt to rapidly remove cyanocobalamin, meaning you mostly just end up with more expensive urine.\n\nSo why is that the most common type?  **It's the cheapest to produce.**  They get bacteria to produce hydroxycobalamin (which is most likely what you got injected with), then filter it through charcoal, where it picks up the cyanide.\n\nFunny story - if you have cyanide poisoning, you get injected with hydroxylcobalanin as treatment.  It has a stronger affinity to cyanide, and binds to it, producing... Cyanocobalamin, which your kidneys harmlessly remove.\n\nIf you buy B12 supplements, be a bit picky.  **Methylcobalamin** is good, but if you find yourself sensitive to it (and already tried lowering the dose) - if it wires you too much - other forms like **hydroxycobalanin** and adenosylcobalmin will do fine.",

Even if you have pernicious anemia (lack of ability to absorb b12 due to an autoimmune destruction of cells that produce intrinsic factor) or other malabsorptive processes, you can still replete your b12 with a daily large dose (1000 to 5000 ug) of oral b12. In fact, studies have shown that a daily oral dose of 1000u is superior to injections likely due to compliance. This is likely because even though you have some inability to absorb b12, you still retain a certain percentage of your absorptive capacity, and thus respond to a larger daily dose. IM injections should only be reserved for severe cases of b12 deficiency leading to neurologic dysfunction (subacute combined degeneration). Some doctors may not be up-to-date with the data and prescribe you IM injections when you don't need them.\nLastly, please don't do this if you don't have a documented b12 deficiency, as it's indeed possible to overdose on b12.\n\nSource: I'm a doctor, but also https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004655.pub3/full",

It's like saying \"YSK regardless of whether you are a sailor, you may very well have scurvy\". Like yeah, it's possible, but not very likely unless you have a specific dietary restriction (hence the mention of vegans) or a specific absorption disorder. If you live in the USA and eat a normal diet you're probably fine. \n\nB12 deficiency is incredibly easy to diagnose. I do agree with this statement:\n\n&gt;If you struggle with low energy and feeling tired you may need to check you B12 levels.\n\nGo see a doctor if you don't feel right. Here's the stats on B12 deficiency straight from the NIH:\n\nhttps://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/\n\n\n&gt;Most people in the United States consume adequate amounts of vitamin B12. Data from the 2013\u20132016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that only 3% of U.S. men had intakes from food and beverages below the EAR for vitamin B12 of 2 mcg, and the rate for women was 8% [30].",

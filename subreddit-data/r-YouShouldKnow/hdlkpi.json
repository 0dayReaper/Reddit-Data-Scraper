So I went and got a burger with them and hey it was actually pretty good.\nMy brother started dating this girl recently who is really really picky, like as picky as I was in middle school. We had them over for a big dinner with my uncle and cousins and my uncle was kinda roasting her like he used to roast me. Gave me flashbacks, was exactly what used to happen at every family dinner and was why I hated family dinners.\nBecoming not a picky eater is just something you\u2019ve got to decide to do, all the pressure from my family just made me want to try things less and they always made a big show about it when I did try stuff. I\u2019m glad I had my friends around in high school because otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be where I am. They never gave me too much shit about it but always encouraged me a bit to come with them and try something. I\u2019m glad they were there for me :)",

Now I don't like letting anyone know I'm drawing at all and it honestly makes the act itself feel somewhat scary and shameful.  It's fucking stifling.\n\nWorst of all, it's hard to confront these people because the defense is always \"Geez, it was just a joke!\"  Now the defendant is the bad guy for getting pissy, and a calm respectful tone does not automatically equal \"not pissy\" to the hazing party.\n\nTL;DR: People need to stop shining a spotlight on good if out-of-character behaviors.  Doing so just encourages many individuals to continue to conform to their or an accepted public image so as to avoid feeling embarrassed and ridiculed as an abnormality.",

I brought in my favorite book, titled \" do not open\". It was a variation of pandoras box. My teacher refused to read it because of the title. He was joking, i know that now, but as a kid it really upset me and I never shared a book with the class ever again. He didnt  hurt my love of reading but he destroyed my confidence in sharing things that were important to me.",

If you want a behavior to occur more often, you reward it. We very rarely use punishment and I've never been on a case where it was used (it's only used in cases where the child's behavior is harmful to themselves) but punishment would be used when you want to see a decrease in a specific behavior. The therapy is rooted in behaviorism. Dog training, and as far as I know all animal training, is rooted in behaviorism. Behaviorism is a very basic view of learning, but it also holds up the best to scientific testing and it's results can be generalized with good accuracy across species.",

I'm a girl who grew up without a father and I wish so badly that I had a male role model to teach me about household appliances or tools or cars or whatever. Shit, I wish my mom had taught me about that stuff but she was too busy just trying to survive as a single parent. I feel like I missed out on so much practical knowledge that would traditionally come from a male role model and I'm still really salty about it even in my thirties.",

If you have girls, please take this into consideration.\n\nMost of us have our own \u201cstyle\u201d when it comes to clothing, and, I\u2019m sure a lot of us felt very strongly about what we wore as teenagers. Whether it\u2019s whatever\u2019s \u201cin style\u201d at the mall, sports themed clothes, band T-shirts, vintage, whatever. If your girls start wearing a particular style by default, apparently that\u2019s their thing. If it\u2019s not your cup of tea, try to come to an understanding about what it might mean for them. And for the love of god, don\u2019t make a huge deal about it if they change or branch out!\n\nI preferred jeans and T-shirts\u2019 and my hoodies. Sort of a tomboy aesthetic. Anytime I even tried something more \u201cgirly,\u201d my dad made a huge deal about it! Well, that was a sure fire way to make me feel self-conscious and guarantee I would never wear that skirt or that pink shirt again.\n\nAlso, and I say this over 20 years later and I\u2019ve long-since realized that my dad is just super awkward and he meant well, but at the time, my teenage moody self also felt that it was too \u201cperv-y\u201d that he would complement me if I wore girly clothes. He\u2019s definitely not a creeper, but to a teenager, it doesn\u2019t take much to make them feel like a parent has crossed a line for anything. My dad telling me \u201cthat outfit shows your body\u201d wasn\u2019t him being a skeeze, he was trying to say that it was a really different look than the baggy T-shirt I always wore which hung to my knees.\n\nBut again, I was a moody teenager who never left my room. Don\u2019t give your girls any extra ammo to think their dad isn\u2019t cool.",

I don't just mean physically move home, but if your son hasn't called in a month, don't mention the absence. Don't put a hurdle there and make it uncomfortable. Just jump straight into talking about good things as if no time passed at all. If there's something deep you need to talk about, do it later. When a pilot is coming in for a landing, just try to make it a good landing.\n\nOtherwise, if you make a big deal about the absence, then the next time will be worse because your son will be thinking about how to explain the absence. So skip right over that. Be welcoming. That way your son will think, \"Oh, it wasn't a big deal at all.\" It needs to be easy for your kid to call you or text you even if it's been a while.\n\nIf every time you call your mom there's a few minutes of feeling guilty and explaining why you haven't called your mom lately, then it adds more strain to what is obviously an already-strained relationship. The result is that you're probably going to call your mom less and less, rather than more. Because that's the way guilt works.\n\nIf you're reaching out to your kid when you haven't heard from them in a while, don't say, \"Haven't heard from you in a while,\" and put that guilt on top of whatever shit they are going through. Instead, pretend the absence didn't happen and ask a question that is easy to answer and has absolutely no consequences like, \"Hey you want our old futon?\" Or, \"I wanted to ask you for TV show and book recommendations. You got any for me?\"",

I can't remember what it's called but I'll try to find it.\n\nEDIT: I believe it's called a reactance, and it's the reason why reverse psychology can sometimes work. Basically you do something of your own free will, but when someone orders you to do it, it limits you to that task, and you no longer choose to do it. It's pretty common in people of all ages, but like most things, an extreme amount of it could be classified as a disorder.",

I used to hear people tell me that and say shit like \"yeah I'll just *stop having severe anxiety*\" and get angry about it.\n\nBut really. You have to do it yourself. If you don't, you're building your own prison for yourself. You may need intense therapy, you may need a new routine, you may need medication, or you may need fuckin' LSD. The important thing is to keep fighting against it and remove it from your life as well as you can. \n\nAnyway, I believe you can do it, and I'm coming from a good place. I wanna say I understand your struggle, but as a person who suffers from a cocktail of mental inconsistencies, I know for a fact no two struggles are the same. But please don't give up.\n\nEdit: someone gave me an award but I just want to point out that I'm not a professional and I still struggle daily.

When I got my job as a cashier I got thrown into the ringer. It went from meeting 0 new people to meeting 100 new people a day. I hardly said a word my first day. I didn't go to therapy, I just had to work through it. It wasn't easy, fast, and I'm certainly not 100% cured, but for me it was the practice that helped a lot.

At work we can start (pre-lockdown I mean) between 8 and 9am, so if I generally arrive for 8:30 and then one day arrive at 8 or 9, there will be comments from one particular person. It's banal and unfunny yet it never stops. It's not even shaming at this point. It's beyond trite.",

Initially i thought that this would be awkward as i used to spend whole day in my room, but turns out this was actually fun. Had long talks and discussion with dad, watched tv together, had a few laughs, played some board games with family. I mean it wasn't a 180\u00b0 change, i still use my phone most of the time and read some books but it was a nice change that's all.",

He always ragged on me for two reasons though: to desensitize me to getting picked on and because he literally didn't understand. \n\nWhen he was a kid, staying in your room was more of a punishment when you weren't somehow nerdy and playing with chemistry sets or reading. He also grew up poor without any technology or even electricity in his house until he was around ten or eleven. So I feel like a lot of that was just him being concerned as a parent, not being able to understand that I was perfectly happy sitting in my room and reading.\n\nHe also didn't understand depression or anxiety because those were things his parents didn't care about. \n\nI dunno, man. I'm 26 and look back on how my parents treated me a lot, and sometimes they were pretty bad which makes stuff like this seem worse. But when I think about certain stuff that used to annoy me - like my dad intentionally embarrassing me in public or getting mad because I skipped school - I have to have some understanding. I feel like if I'd done that at the time I would have learned a lot and avoided some bad feelings.",

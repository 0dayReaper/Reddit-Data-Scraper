The purpose of the program is to \u2018give\u2019 to those in need whether it\u2019s due to depression, stress, financial concerns, etc. \nI highly recommend giving back when you are able to!\n\nETA 2: I apologize, I am in the US. The site isn\u2019t available in all countries BUT if you know of similar alternatives please comment them!",

Many people requesting just need a break, need food or need compassion and care from their local community. I would say if you request one to try to be thankful and not just use this to get something \u2018free.\u2019",

He has been sick since he got covid in 2021 and mostly he's bedridden now, so what's supposed to be his fun years (he's 18 now) he's been too sick to leave his room. I requested one on a whim, just thinking maybe it would lift his spirits and it really did. He said he could feel the love and care put in to it, and it was a whole meal! It made him happy and it's so hard for him to find that feeling these days. So really, thank you for doing this for people.",

We also do meal trains for when someone is having a rough time, like if their husband deploys, etc.  Right now we have one going for someone who broke her foot. There are so many other awesome aspects of my club, but this is an awesome perk.",

            "comment": "Finally, an excuse to use my lasagna recipe\n\nEDIT: Lasagna is a pretty straightforward recipe to begin with: sauce, meat, cheese, and pasta. It isn't enough to just make sauce, though, because part of the sauce includes drippings from meatballs and sausage. Specifically for lasagna, I like to brown sweet Italian sausage in the oven, then mash them up and get them into smaller pieces. These go straight into the sauce. Incidentally, the sauce is a mix of about 2:1 sauce to paste. Contadina makes these big 105 oz. cans that work great. We also add in some crushed and peeled tomatoes as well, along with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, a lot of onion, a lot of garlic, parsley, oregano. That simmers on low heat all day long.\n\nWhen you're ready to start assembling, put a thin layer of sauce down first to keep your noodles from burning against the bottom of the pan. Add your noodles next. Then add your sauce and meat, followed by a layer of ricotta cheese. I also like to add in plenty of Mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as well. Repeat layering until you reach the top of your pan, then add a top layer of Mozzarella on top. Cover with aluminum foil and cook at 350\u2070 for half an hour. Take it out, remove the foil, and place it back in thr oven for 15 - 30 minutes.",

For example, you can say you only want to do it one time a month, or you could choose to do two lasagnas every week, it\u2019s totally in your control. You can also skip weeks if you need to as well. What I really like about it is it is its not based on a financial need, anyone can request a lasagna for any reason. It\u2019s about providing warmth and comfort to someone in need.\n\nOn the weeks that you\u2019ve chosen to bake, they will send you notification within the app of who you will be baking for and any information the person who\u2019s requested it has provided. That could include, number of people, allergies or dietary requirements, for example, they don\u2019t eat beef or pork. You contact them and arrange the delivery.\n\nI went on Pinterest and created a whole list of different baked lasagnas and pastas, both with meat, and vegetarian, that I could draw from. I ended up with my go to recipe, as I bake weekly I\u2019ll make a big pot of sauce then freeze portions for the next four weeks. You absolutely don\u2019t have to do this, many people just use jarred sauces. I like doing that because I could go to Costco and do a big huge bulk shop to make things easier. You also ask the people if they want it baked or unbaked and take it to them. Some weeks depending on my budget. I will add extras like a  loaf of garlic bread and or a desert, but that is not required at all. \n\nMy birthday week I prepared a lasagna for each decade of my life and donated multiple that week. Some people will incorporate their children or friends into the process. \n\nI highly recommend it it is really fulfilling and a really simple way to touch someone\u2019s life.",

            "comment": "Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful website. I visited the site just out of curiosity and I started reading about this wonderful and amazing gift people are sharing with those in need.\n\nWithin a minute or two the tears started rolling and the snot dripping from my nose .I started reminiscing of better times when a home cooked meal prepared by my mother was the best thing that I never truly appreciated until she got older and she could no longer do it without injuring herself. \n\nOh how I wish I could turn back time and not skip the countless meals she prepared because I was too busy or too fucked up to spend time with my parents and enjoy the meal she worked so hard to prepare outta of love.\n\nNo matter the time of night or early morning I would stumble home there was always a plate perfectly wrapped in tinfoil or the knockoff plastic wrap waiting for me. It just wasn't the same experience eating alone drunk, high or hungover by myself eating it cold or heated up. \n\nI'd give anything in the world just to walk into the house and get smacked in the face with the smell of fresh flour tortillas in the air and the many different spices racing by my nose. \n\nHer voice yelling over the radio tuned in to Spanish music or the television faithfully tuned to Univision telling me the food is almost ready and to go let my father know while she's handing me a fresh hot tortilla perfectly rolled up after she had spread butter on it. \n\nI apologize to everyone for ranting but I felt like I needed to get that out. Reddit is the only place I have that I feel someone will actually take the time to listen. I lost everyone and started losing everything when my parents passed. Family forgot about me and shut me out even after reaching out countless times for someone just to talk to because I was spiraling into the darkness of depression and the bottom of countless bottles and what seemed like an endless supply of drugs. \n\nI don't blame them or anyone but myself for the demons that I'm currently battling. I am a grown adult and no one forced the drugs on me or the bad choices.\n\nI do badly want to request one because it's been forever and a day it seems like since I've had a lasagna or a home cooked meal made from the love someone wants to share. \n\nI don't deserve one and I'd just be taking a person/family's spot way more deserving than me.  \nBut the thought was nice and brought out a genuine smile and memories of better days and missed opportunities. \n\nAnyways point that I was trying to make is if you still have the opportunity for a hot home cooked meal don't take them for granted. You never know when the last one is until it's just a memory. A better time and place. \n\nTldr: I've made bad choices, miss home cooked meals and I ugly cried while browsing a website that gives out free lasagna.",

That's the first time I've ever opened up and let it out but it just seemed like the right place and time to do it. \n\nThe site you shared gave me hope that I had lost long ago. Now I feel that little pang of hope in my heart that things can and will get better. I just have to make better choices and take one step at a time. \n\nI prayed to God for a miracle that takes the addiction and the pain away countless times. In tears begging, crying, yelling because it never happened. \n\nUntil one morning I realized after waking up feeling clear headed and feeling better that every time that last hit or drink was gone and I fell asleep after days of making the wrong choices. I was waking up in the miracle I had prayed for so many times.\n\n God gave me my miracle every single time I was just too stupid and blind to see it.  I was sober and on the path down the right road. I was in my miracle every single time I woke up. \n\nI'm not sure how many more miracles I'll be granted because honestly I keep fucking it up trying to take shortcuts with bad choices. \n\nOne day soon I'll beat these demons or die trying. \n\nOnce again thank you so so so much for reviving the hope for a better life.",

We were too messed up to even think about cooking meals and this is what got us through the week. It was a small gesture but it meant a lot to me at the time, and still does.\n\nOh boy, really missing that pup now.",

Like the smog in China and mines in West Virginia, etc. \n\nWithin the next decade or two, I imagine privacy will be like this, where most developed countries have sophisticated safeguards against loss of privacy and other countries will be notorious for not having them. \n\nAnd then we can have a little Greta cry about how a loss of privacy destroyed Australia or whatever.",

I know WVA isnt it's own country, I just wanted the writing to flow without having a million caveats, and I figured most people would get it and not care. \n\nAdditionally, I could have said \"United States\", but most of the states don't mine anymore. So I opted to name West Virginia, as they are so dependent on mining as an economic boon, that shutting it off like a switch would devastate the region. Hence, why they still have mining there - not because they don't understand that mining is bad, they just can't do anything else to make money, but that too is changing.",

Some apps did essentially the same thing in the past and dev notifications reached customers, but sometimes the mistakes made in production are much bigger. Amazon accidently deleted parts of load balancing state database disrupting service to many of their customers for a short time. Cloudflare took down half of the internet once because an update wasn't tested properly and caused their servers to use 100% of their CPU on one regular expression.\n\nAccidently testing in production isn't unusual and here there were no consequences other than scaring and waking up some users. \n\nAnd if they sent a different notification to that one user they didn't need to send it to others. If government services were involved there was also a much easier way to get his phone to ring that didn't require a major manufacturer to send notifications to thousands of devices - they could've used a nearby gsm base station, or even bring their own IMSI catcher to not have to ask any company for help, and send an SMS to every connected device. Would do essentially the same thing while not requiring nearly as much effort and working even if the user isn't connected to the internet as long as he is connected to cellular network.",

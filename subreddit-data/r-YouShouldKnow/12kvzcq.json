I rarely carry much cash and certainly not exact amounts so if I need to pay a friend for something like a the share of a tshirt he ordered in bulk or something like that it works great.\n\nVenmo is pretty similar but adds a \"social\" layer on top of that that I see as worse than useless.  I not only don't see a reason I'd want people to know I paid my friend but what if I were buying something more embarrassing or in legally questionable\n\nThe only use case I can see is for people that sell small things as a business and it serves as a form of advertising or for the idiots that think of themselves as \"influencers\" that think anyone gives a shit about their hand crafter cookie cutter purchase or whatever they bought.  But I see the potential problems this causing far outweighing any benefits I can think of in my imagination.\n\nIf I look back through my PayPal history I see purchases for a skin/decal for my steam deck, some game deals through Fanatical, movie ticket purchases, Humble Bundle, new egg, some exotic snacks, etc. I've had a friend pay me through Venmo a few times for his share of a big taco order I made.  Nothing I can see any of my friends giving a flying fuck about.\n\nAnyhow, digital funds transfers both commercial and private are great.  Adding in social media component isn't.  Maybe I'll make an app where people can broadcast every time they take a shit and all the details about it.  I see that as about as desirable.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Rabbits, while great pets, are very high maintenance pets. Pet stores see an increased amount of sales around Easter, by impulsive buyers.  They can NOT live a happy life in a cage like you see in movies. They are very loving but very destructive and will eat anything they can fit their mouths around. They require specialty vets, regular grooming, and a lot of space. Most rabbits do not like being held and are very skittish, meaning they are not always the best pets for young children. \n\nPets in general should never be an impulse buy, unfortunately rabbits are regularly impulsively bought around easter. Do your research and make sure you are ready for a 10+ year commitment and a lot of destruction. This is not to dissuade anyone genuinely looking to adopt, they are very loving and fun pets just a lot of work.",

I literally put her in my backpack and carried her home on my chest. She must have been newly dumped because she was so passive and friendly she would definitely have been chomped by something within a day or two. \n\nHad to keep her for several weeks until we could find a new home for her because all the rescues near us were full!",

Like that seems like a horrible thing in itself, a pet isn't something you can just return to a store like a pair of shoes. I am also pretty sure pet stores that sell pets for money were banned in my state other than places that sell things like pet food and small fish. But you can't sell dogs, cats, rabbits out of a store here. However we do have non for profit animal rescue's running locations in malls etc.\n\nBut I would imagine those places would interview you and not let you have an animal if you were doing something silly like buying your kids a rabbit for easter\n\nMost responsible breeders and stores won't sell rabbits during easter or spring at all, they might pick up a month after easter",

And quite frankly, I don\u2019t agree with buying breeder animals on a personal level, so what you said is even more poignant. The vet who we took our dog too said he\u2019d be 50~ pounds, that same vet just weighed him at 90 last week. \n\n&gt;\tSometimes you get home, give it some time and it just dosent work out. That\u2019s okay.\n\nThis is a horrible situation to be in for everyone. Like you said, some animals hate kids. My dog, who is 7, has never been around children anymore than passing and does not care for them despite a great dog in public. I thinks the fun sized humans confuse him honestly. \n\nEither way, thank you for adding nuance and thought to a persons comment that was boiled way too far down, and is nothing close to black and white. \n\nPeople, new families are an incredibly huge thing for animals.

Fish store sold me some sick fish, I informed them and they were right fucking cunts about it so I took the corpses back and cited their returns policy then never went there again. \n\nI later learnt a lot of shady shit about that place a clandestine water sample of one of their tanks showed dangerous ammonia levels, they used to be decent but new owners took over. Eventually I dug up some reviews of their former location and they were pretty terrible. \n\nPlace closed down when covid hit the fan. \n\nIt was grim and difficult taking the bodies back but I was not about to fund their animal abuse. I did have a difficult few days trying to keep these fish alive and going back and forth on if I should return them alive or not.\n\nIf an animal is sold under deceptive conditions it's a really really hard one. Right now my spare tank is full of tetras with neon tetra disease, likely picked up during shipping from the breeder to the store or during breeding but possibly picked up in the store itself. It's so hard to spot that early on, damn near impossible unless the breeder is very upfront and ethical and the store is too which is exceptionally rare to find. \n\nIt's why most of the time pet stores suck. \n\nBut yeah a long winded rant to say that at least where I am all the customer protection rights you have when buying a rabbit plush apply when buying a rabbit. As far as they are concerned you bought a thing and you can return that thing within the returns window unless you so terribly abuse it that it is no longer returnable. Aka you can't buy, intentionally murder or neglect the animal then return it for your money back. \n\nThere are some situations in which it can be a good thing. I would much prefer an animal be returned to a place of safety opposed to being dumped someplace or whatever. I'm sure the animal would also prefer that if it wasn't terrified the whole time. I would also much prefer if places that make their living selling unwell animals dolled up to look okay don't get to keep that money in their pockets to go on to do it again and again.",

Emergancy trip to the vet for a broken spine. Fluffy didn't get enough time to hop about? Gnaw marks all over your house. Fluffy had a little too much time to hop about? Now she is gone due to the local fox. Didn't sit quietly next to fluffy and reassuring her you aren't a threat before attempting a petting? Emergancy trip to A&amp;E because they have one hell of a bite. Also fluffys freakout and subsequent scuffle might mean while you are getting stitches she is at the vet again. Fluffy just took a giant turd in front of the kids and now she is eating it and it's freaking them all out as well as you? Emergancy family meeting about how rabbits are cute and fluffy is still wonderful but she is also going to eat some of her poos and thats just what rabbits do. Fluffy had some babies? There is a non 0 chance she will groom the babies so fastidiously that she ends up just *chewing off their ears*. \n\nI knew a rabbit once who decided one night she was so fucking over her cagemate that they had a fight about it. The fight was so brutal both rabbits died. One with large bloody wounds, the other with no outward wounds but a mouth and throat full of random chunks of its cagemate.",

Where I live they are exactly the same rights. \n\nVirtually all shelters and ethical breeders also have no questions return policies because they do not want to see the animals end up in dodgy situations. \n\nHell I remeber when I got my dog over 15 years ago. They said that if there was ever an issue *at any time in his life* he had a place there. He's my little old man now and I wouldn't dream of it but I also belive that if I tried tomorrow to take him back, that door would be open. \n\nHell I breed mantids and the few I have rehomed it's the same policy. If you can't care for it anymore or a weird health thing pops up - you know where I am. No questions asked. \n\nBetter back with me than dead, abandoned or going free to the nearest nutter on craigslist. Sometimes folks get in too deep. Even if they do their research it is still sometimes a shock to change your whole life potentally to revolve around the needs of another creature. You may think you are up for it but after a week or a month of actually living it you might end up learning your capabilities just aren't what you thought they were.",

            "comment": "Thank you for this post. My much-loved rabbit of almost ELEVEN years died two weeks ago. They are not easy pets and are not really as interactive as dogs or cats. They can fall sick very quickly or injure themselves very easily and need a lot of attention. Kids really should never ever ever have rabbits. It's a huge commitment and they breed so quickly...I've had a lot of rabbits. Lots of wires, even new ones, got chewed lol. Lots of furnishings, rugs, etc chewed up for fun. I don't hold it against them, but this is something pretty much nobody knows. We didn't know anything about rabbits when we got 3 of them home 11 years ago.\n\nTheir pee stinks a LOT and leaves strange marks that never really fade.\n\nThey really dislike being held UNLESS you've made it a point to hold them often since childhood. Some rabbits can really be as loving and interactive as dogs but that is rare.\n\nThey generally don't like interacting with humans.\n\nYou need to find a special vet that has experience with rabbits, and of course, that can be expensive depending on where you live.\n\nIf they don't eat for 12ish hours they can die. You need to constantly monitor if they're eating and pooping, and if not, rush them to the vet.\n\nThey WILL chew your cables, wires, rugs, books, etc if they're within easy reach.\n\nThey will poop wherever they feel like. (Peeing is usually done in a fixed area, but pooping happens pretty randomly).\n\nTwo rabbits that don't get along can seriously injure each other.\n\ntl;dr don't get a pet rabbit, they're really not pets in the usual sense.",

One year around Easter her troop got rabbits, chicks, and ducklings because they are Sooo cute. Well as the little critters started to grow, these kids couldn\u2019t keep them in their small yards or apartments. So our neighbor asked if my family would take them. We did and had 15 chickens, 5 ducks and a goose. The stricken goose was the sweetest we named her fluffy and she would fallow is kids around like a dog. We had the rabbits (12 of them)for a few weeks, but my parents where not into keeping them. But found a family who raised them for FFA and 4H. \n\nMy dad had a very stern conversation with our neighbor the next year to remind he to NOT buy baby animals because they are \u201cCUTE.\u201d They are living breathing creatures that need to be cared for, buying them for cuteness is how they die.",

We'd see him every few days, feed him sometimes, but he lived a good healthy life of there.",

One day Sam decided he was going to make a meal out of them all. That\u2019s not even the worst part, the worst part is we lived beside a highway with a then speed limit of 55 miles per hour. When we awoke to not a bunny in sight, our late mother decided it would be better to tell us they all were hit by a semi \ud83d\ude33 \nThe moral of this story is also protect your bunnies from other carnivorous pets.",

What scared me more than driving that fast was the truck taking control.\n\n10 miles later I saw a line of chp cars hitting the highway and getting ready to catch speeders.\n\nEdit: change year to 03 which probably isn\u2019t as impressive as getting a 93 f150 over a hundred but my older brother may have come close in my dads 85 f250 with a big block. We never knew how fast he got that truck to go because the odometer stopped at 85 and he got well past that mark but it was a rough ride. A work truck isnt meant to hit that kind of speed. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m mentioning my accomplishment of hitting over a 100 in my truck because 1) first time hitting that mark and 2) the odometer in that year and model maxed out at 100 so seeing that needle past that mark is something I\u2019ll always remember.",

When you change to KPH the little light that says KPH comes on and the MPH light goes off and now your car probably can do 160.....(KPH).",

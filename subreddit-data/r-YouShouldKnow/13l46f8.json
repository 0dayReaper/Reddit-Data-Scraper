    "postText": "Why YSK: Many outdoor devices like cameras, kids toys, smart sensors, etc. require batteries and many of them even call out lithium batteries as a necessity for this reason. Many people might just think that this is some scheme or ploy to get people to buy expensive batteries that make it look like their battery life is good. In reality, typical Alkaline batteries simply don't last as long as their advertised capacity would indicate when in winter conditions. Ni-MH and Lead Acid batteries work in these conditions, but not quite as well as Lithium batteries. \n\nI know it's spring time for us in the Northern Hemisphere, but it's definitely something to keep in mind the next time you change out any batteries that will be used outdoors!",

It should be clarified that the non-rechargeable **Lithium-metal** battery is the better choice, as opposed to the rechargeable **Lithium-ion** battery, for a device that will sit unused for a long time. Rechargeable batteries discharge over time. Also, high temperatures will degrade a lithium-ion battery.",

            "comment": "Something to add: the reason why battery performance can fluctuate and requires an ideal operating temperature is because all of the batteries we use are provide chemical energy that requires chemical reactions to work.\n\nHigher temperatures increase the rate of the reaction, thus use up the chemical energy and reduce your battery life.\n\nLow temperatures slow down the chemical reaction, so charging will be slower and energy will not be released at the rater needed for operation (and not at all if the temperature is low enough).\n\nFor Li-ion, you would want these temperature ranges ideally (unless it has some sort of thermal management):\n\nDischarge Temperature: -4\u00b0 F to 130\u00b0 F\n\nCharge Temperature: 32\u00b0 F to 114\u00b0 F\n\nStorage Temperature: 20\u00b0 F to 95\u00b0 F",

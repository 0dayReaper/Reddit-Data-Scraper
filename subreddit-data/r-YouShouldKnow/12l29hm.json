It is not considered overdue, and in fact another massive eruption on the scale of historical ones is seen as unlikely by volcanologists within the next 100000 years",

[Yellowstone doesn't even warrant the highest risk rating from the USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/map-volcano-threat-category-designated-color) and while a giant eruption *is* possible, the odds are almost exactly the same as a 1km meteorite hitting the earth. The notion of Yellowstone as a deadly supervolcano in waiting appears to be the victim of a Shark Week style ratings grab from TV shows less concerned with the science.",

It would likely be a smaller quake, similar to what's been in the past. \n\nOur methods of advance warning have gotten a lot better, too. \n\nSimilar events that we'll probably see are the Cascadia event and Mount St. Helens again too.

And what I can add to this, is that construction code here in CA requires a lot of extra structural reinforcement systems within modern buildings over the last few decades that make them very structurally sound against earthquakes. Not to say a big a earthquake from the San Andreas fault line will not cause damage and destruction, especially to older homes but I don't think it'll be a mass death event like we have seen the past few years in developing countries, or corrupt countries that lack construction regulations. So hopefully this gives any CA peeps reading this some piece of mind",

This is the standard, you will never see a volcanologist make a concrete prediction for future eruptive behaviour and the above article is appropriately hedging. Theres also an important distinction in short timescale predictions (where magma movement, quakes, and tilting are variables) and multi-millennia trends. Our error bars on the timelines essentially can encompass the entirety of recorded human history for systems like this. There\u2019s broad scientific consensus that the type of eruption the public fears is not a meaningful threat, based on more than just the three datapoint trend line. That is discussed in the links above when there\u2019s a mention of magma chamber solidification. :)",

As far as I can find the total eruptive volume of two eruptions at Valles caldera is 600 km^3, which would rule either out as a supervolcano (&gt;1000 km^3) \n2. If you look at the links for Yellowstone above, there\u2019s a mention that supervolcanoes don\u2019t tend to recur in the same place, so looking at historical sites of supervolcanoes as locations for subsequent ones will usually have you looking in the wrong place.",

Newer cell phones can trigger a crash message to 911, even if you did not crash. 911 will call back, if you ignore the call they assume that you are injured and they send a response that usually includes 2 fire trucks, 2 police cars and an ambulance. If police call you back and you answer you can tell them everything is ok, and these resources can be released to go help someone else. If you do not answer the call they all respond to the area that the phone call was sent from and search for a non-existent crash. This is a terrible waste of resources that could be helping someone else. Every day I hear a few calls where the crash message was sent and resources were sent, and there is no crash, calls to the phone went unanswered.",

People are good at lying and, it\u2019s extremely hard to judge that over the phone. It\u2019s best to always send somebody just to be sure.

I set of off so many time before I figured out how it was happening. I was always able to stop the countdown before the 911 call happened. Then one morning, around 4:30,  I had woken up to use the bathroom. I picked up my phone as I was getting back in bed to check the time, and it fell and got stuck straight up between the bed and the nightstand. By the time I got it unstuck, the SOS countdown had finished and started the phone call. I hung up before the call connected, and thought that would be fine, so I rolled over and went back to sleep.  Emergency services called back, but my phone was on silent, so I didn\u2019t answer. 20 minutes later a sheriff\u2019s deputy showed up at my house. I was mostly asleep and disoriented, so it took me a few minutes to understand why he was there. Thats when I finally figured out how to turn that feature off.",

Then after few hours on charge, I tried to push buttons, nothing. So I tried to force reboot it like the old time. Ok, nothing. I told him the screen is bad. So I left my phone on the vanity and I was sitting on my toilet, I kept hearing something like someone's talking, but not clear and sounds far away, I thought it was from the TV. So I finished my business, cleaned my hands, while cleaning my hands I was singing (badly), then I shut the water off, was wiping my hands and heard this again, I was so curious and wondered what is it, I went to living room and it was not from the TV. So I went back to the bathroom, I stood there for like 30secs, just trying to figure out where is the voice from. Finally!!! I picked up that damn iphone and someone said \"911, what's your emergency?\", Holy shit I was so shocked, I haven't touched the phone for like 10mins, and there was no sim card in the phone even!! So I said \"hello??\" Then the girl on the other end said \"911, what's your emergency?\" I was so shocked I asked her \"is this real?\" She said \"yes this is 911\". I was like omg I'm soooo sorry, I didn't mean to call 911, I was fixing the phone and the screen was totally black so I dont know what I did, and it doesn't even have a sim card in there! She laughed she said it's ok, phones can do that now. Just need to confirm my address and she will make some note on the call history. So I confirmed my address and then I apologized again, it's been like 10mins and I felt so bad I wasted her time and someone could have called for real emergency. She said it's ok, no worries, don't have a panic attack. So she hang up because I couldnt. Then later, cop car showed up on the street, I thought oh shit they gonna ask me about it. Then didn't, they went to one of the neighbors and then left. I guess maybe it is to confirm nothing happened at my house by asking if they saw anything weird. I have fixed tons of phones and I have never had this happened to me...need to be more careful next time.",

Me: \"Yes, hello. I didn't mean to dial...\" the bluetooth was wigging out and it hung up the call. They called back \"I'm sorry, it was an accident\" Them: \"Sir, DO NOT hang up the phone.\" It hung up on him. Third time same as the second. I then disconnect bluetooth, dial back the number and explain myself. It was a different operator and they already dispatched an officer. At that point I had not dressed for the day nor brushed my teeth yet (about 10 am.) So, when I answered the door dressed, teeth brushed and a bit wide eyed and panting the officer clearly suspected me of something. I know I could have told him to go pound sand without a warrant and all, but it was such a bizarre sequence of events I let the officer in to look around. He left after a few minutes, but I could tell he did so against his better judgement. Anyway, that feature gets turned off first thing on new phones.",

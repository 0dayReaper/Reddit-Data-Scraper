    "postText": "Why YSK: the younger a dog is, the more receptive it is to strange things. If your puppy hears things like thunder and fireworks at a young age, they\u2019re less likely to be scared of it when they\u2019re older. It\u2019s also important to have them used to being touched, especially their paws, since every dog needs their nails taken care of. It\u2019s also a good idea to bring your dog to the groomer as soon as they\u2019re able, *especially* if they\u2019re going to need regularly groomed for the rest of their life (eg poodles, doodles with hair, shih tzus, bichons, and any other dog with hair [yes hair, not fur, because hair grows continuously whereas fur stops growing at a certain length]) \u2013 it\u2019ll help keep your pup less stressed once they\u2019re used to it, and the less time the groomer has to spend trying to work on a stressed/reactive dog, the faster it\u2019ll go (duh) and (most likely) the better it\u2019ll look.",

No one said to beat your dog or be relentlessly aggressive, their refuting it and arguing against it is irrelevant.  Also that a pair of dogs lead the pack instead of one dog is irrelevant, even useful. Dogs are, however, socially hierarchical. They do behaviors like controlling narrow spaces and you can observe this yourself.  Do you believe *that* has been debunked? So why shouldn't you control that space instead of the dog?",

If he won\u2019t listen to you, it\u2019s because you either need to manage him better or whatever he is doing is more rewarding than listening to you.\n\n2. If he demands attention just because he wants attention, that needs to be ignored. If he is trying to get your attention because he needs something, you have to meet that need. Dogs should not have to \u201cearn\u201d basic things like food, water, proper grooming, vet care, and the ability to go to the bathroom outside.\n\n3. The puzzle toy part is fantastic! The eating first thing is completely useless.\n\n4. Forcefully taking away a toy is a great way to develop resource guarding as countless owners across the various dog subreddits will tell you. Unless it\u2019s life threatening, don\u2019t take it. Either trade it for something of higher value or teach the \u201cdrop it\u201d command and reward when the toy is dropped.\n\n5. \u201cThe alpha never walks around his littermates.\u201d This is just\u2026 not a thing. \n\n6. Leash manners are desirable in every dog, but a dog doesn\u2019t pull because he wants to be in charge. He pulls because he sees something that is more exciting and/or interesting than you are.\n\n7. This is pointless.\n\n8. Recall is good, but when training recall you need to reward *every time* even if he doesn\u2019t come immediately. This teaches him that the faster he recalls, the faster he gets a yummy treat or other special reward.\n\n9. Dogs jump because of either excitement or rarely aggression, not dominance.\n\n10. Again, this is just not a thing!\n\n11. This is alright, but the dog can absolutely initiate play if he wants to play!\n\n12. This is pretty good, but the ignoring period needs to be much shorter. A few hours is way too long and after a certain period of time your dog won\u2019t be able to link being ignored to the bite that he did three hours ago.\n\n13. Aside from maybe the wait at the door thing, this is fine.\n\n14. Totally fine.\n\n15. *This. Is. Not. A. Thing!*",

Practice pulling up their jowls up because vets need to look at their teeth. Also clean their teeth once a year if needed. They have teeth like yours. Would you only brush once a year? Teeth health is systemic health. Play doorbells once every few hours when they are pups for months and don't react so they don't charge the door. Ear plugs help. Take them to parades and farmers/ saturday markets so they are used to all sounds, music, people acting eradic, smells and crowds. It isn't desensitization as much as it is socialization, and that is a lifelong thing, not just when they are young. Thought my pup was doing alright, moved to the beach, he barked at tree trunks that washed up like our lives were in danger. Always be socializing. Everything is a fun adventure. Happy doggy lives.

She is doing very well in the kennel, we are teaching her that it is a safe/positive area for her and not as punishment. In the morning when we are about to take her outside to potty/poop, she pees in the excitement right on her bed, walking, laying, or sitting in her accident. Then it goes everywhere on me because she jumps on me in excitement, and all over the carpet as she runs around. We also use the leash on her in the mornings as we take her outside to keep her on the path to outside. She still goes pee outside 5 mins later, and we tell her good girl, but is there a way to stop the excitement pee accidents? It's the only time she has accidents now.\n\nEdit: Also, anything to help with nipping and jumping on people/dogs. I know she is just trying to play. And we will redirect with a toy of hers instead, or hide our hands and turn our bodies away from her. From there after 2-3 tries she will give up and either sit or walk somewhere else in the yard. When she is just licking our hands we tell her good girl. The jumping is definitely hard. But this is our 3 big issues, and other than that she is a perfect, sweet pup.",

She is actually giving you a huge compliment. :) Obviously, though, you\u2019re not actually a pack of dogs, so piddling as a polite gesture isn\u2019t workable. The cure is to NOT greet her enthusiastically but take her immediately outside to do her business. Same goes whenever you\u2019re letting her out of the crate \u2014 say/do NOTHING to increase excitement \u2014 this includes looking her in the eyes \u2014 but be moving toward the door and outside as soon as possible. She will grow out of this. Look up \u201csubmissive urination\u201d for more info. Good luck!",

Gagging is uncomfortable and she will eventually learn to associate nipping hands with gagging. Let me know if questions. NOTE: Do NOT let children do this gag technique.\n\nFor jumping: Raise your knee so she hits it with her chest when she jumps. Do NOT knee your dog in the chest! Just raise your knee when she starts to jump so she hits the knee with her own jumping force. Ask guests to do this, too.",

A healthy weight on a dog usually means a nice long life.  My first pup lived to be 15, my second is 14 (unfortunately cancer means she won\u2019t reach 15), our third is 13, the other two are still young 4 and 6.   We ensure plenty of exercise (having a big yard helps) and keep the weight perfect.   I may be terrible at controlling my weight but I can be damn sure to keep my dogs weight at their ideal weight, it\u2019s not hard.  With older dogs it also helps to get a puppy - the puppy will learn from the older dogs and since they have so much energy will help the older dog stay active.",

Or not put the second bracket in at all.\n\nBrackets are meant for short standalone sentences that aren't that important to the overall text and serve to add extra context or clarification. If your bracket needs another bracket it shouldn't be in a bracket.\n\nBy doing as you suggest you could cause confusion because usually square brackets are used to indicate something put in by someone other than the original author. \n\nFor example a newspaper may quote someone saying \"I'm devastated that they lost the game\" but then add in square brackets for clarification so it reads \"I'm devastated they [Arsenal] lost the [football] game\". \n\nIt's to add in context the original author didn't while still retaining the exact wording of a direct quote. \n\nOf course in an article talking about the Manchester v Arsenal 1-0 game(I don't watch football) the square brackets wouldn't exactly be necessary in this case, especially when you name them as an arsenal supporter beforehand. But there's plenty of cases where a normal person will leave context out of their quote because they view it as obvious.",

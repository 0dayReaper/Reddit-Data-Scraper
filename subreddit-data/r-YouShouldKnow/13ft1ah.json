    "postText": "**Why YSK: This information regarding Regal gift cards is nowhere to be found on their website or on the small print of the physical gift card. I had a *infuriating exchange* with a customer service representative to learn about it.**  \n  \nI found the hard way that, when you upload a a physical Regal gift card balance to a smart phone, you're actually uploading it to that **device**. I unexpectedly needed to replace my smart phone earlier in the year. When I attempted to use my balance some time later, there was no evidence of a balance or previous history on the new phone or on a web browser. So I contacted customer service to find out what happened.  \n  \nCustomer service first advised me to always keep the physical gift cards since the balance on the app will be lost if the app is reinstalled or updated.  \n  \nOf course I no longer had the physical gift card - I threw it out as every other service I use, I assumed the gift card is attached to my **account**.  \n  \nI was then asked to provide the last four digits of the card, approximate amount used, and the theater location in order to locate the card OR provide a receipt to prove the purchase. I could not provide that kind of information because the physical card was tossed and was attached to a *device that I no longer possessed.* So I had to contact the person who gave me a gift card. I scanned the copy of the receipt to show the proof of purchase.  \n  \nCustomer service told me that, since the gift card was purchased through a third party (in this case, a grocery store), they could not accept that proof. That was the last exchange I had since I was so baffled.     \n\n**TL;DR: Keep your physical Regal gift cards AND receipts, don't upload it to a device unless you want to risk losing it when replacing a device or to something like an *app update*!**",

    "postText": "A wise man once said that, I can't remember where I heard it, but it boils down to this:\n\nWhy YSK: If something is important, it's usually better to half-ass it than it is to not do it at all.\n\nSome examples: \nGot a big test tomorrow and not up to studying? Study for 15 minutes. A 40 is much better than a 0.\nDon't feel like working out today? Go for a walk.\nToo busy for breakfast? Drink a cup of milk.\nStayed up too late? Go to bed right now. 3 hours of sleep is superior to none.\nThe pile of dirty dishes too daunting? Wash 5.\nCan't do the whole yard? Mow the front.\n\nThe principle can be applied to various situations in life. Often times you may find that after you get started, you feel motivated to complete the task, but if not, hey...you did part of it, and that's nothing to sneeze at (and it's certainly better than nothing.)\n\nY'all take care of yourselves",

Either I blow expectations out of the water or fall flat on my face because I was to obsessed with getting less important details perfect. To date, every paper that I have turned in got an A grade. Every one I didn't got me nothing. Not sure why Ive never been able to submit a C- paper. If I can't be exceptional at something I lose interest and motivation. Never considered that perfectionist was a part of my problem until a very wise coworker flat out told me it was my biggest flaw. I always thought perfectionist got everything perfect. Turns out that it really means perfect or fail. Not a great way to go through life but it does make for an interesting ride. \n\nFor anyone that is thinking I just told the story of your life and is undiagnosed, make an appointment with a specialist right now! Like get off reddit and search google for \"adhd specialist near me\". Copy and paste.\n\nWhy are you still reading this?! Google it now and call the nearest specialist!",

Work hard, stay out of trouble, make nice with teachers, don't be an ass. You don't have to be a kiss ass, but don't get labeled a \"bad kid.\" Then when you mess up (either accidentally or intentionally), you get leniency.\n\nIn college this is less relevant for big classes. When you're an ID number instead of a person, it matters less.\n\nFor college, find a teacher you like and take more of their classes! I took two history/culture classes with a teacher and the second one was so easy because it was the same set up, just slightly different material. Plus I got to save money by using the same book!",

To OP's point, if it's worth it to you to quit drinking alcohol, then 42 drinks/week is better than 70 drinks/week, even if you can't see yourself going to 0/week any time soon.

A C in Chemistry 1 is gonna make Chemistry 2 really difficult. If you pull off a C in Chemistry 1&amp;2, Organic Chemistry becomes near impossible. If you pull of a C in all three, somehow defying the odds, you face Physical Chemistry, the most daunting one, and you barely learned enough to survive the previous three.",

I'll write \"clean sink, clean counter, clean floor, etc.\" Or if it's an email I'm putting off replying too, I'll write \"open email window, write draft of email, type in email address, click send.\" I aim for doing a step once an hour within an hour time frame, or keep going if I feel like it. Even though it may take five hours to send an email, I wouldn't have if I did it all at once. And then I get to cross off like ten things in a day which is always so satisfying. Or even if I only got through half of my cleaning goals, it's still better than not at all.",

A walk is not a poor workout. It may not meet one's fitness goals. It may not be enough for long-term health. But, in and of itself, it's a good and useful activity. Also, if it's the best you can muster at that moment, it's not a poor activity, it's a fantastic activity because it's doing something good for you.  \n\n\nIn other contexts, these activities may be viewed as \"poor\". I just think judgement words like that are dangerous are frame things is harmful ways. At least, for me, I found the word off-putting.  \n\n\nAbsolutely love this advice though. Is doesn't apply for all things (the skydiving joke up top is a joke but also isn't). It's more about the value of making any progress versus zero progress. Sometimes any is better than none. And if you choices are any versus none because full feels unattainable, doing \"any\" is a great way to avoid choosing to do nothing.",

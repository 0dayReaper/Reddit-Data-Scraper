    "postText": "\nWhy YSK: Most people I talk to use these terms interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. And to be fair I didn\u2019t realize there was a difference until recently.\n\n\u201cA heart attacks occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If the blocked artery is not reopened quickly, the part of the heart normally nourished by that artery begins to die. The longer a person goes without treatment, the greater the damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cSymptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense or start slowly with mild symptoms. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s also possible to have mild symptoms or even no symptoms at all and still have a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually doesn\u2019t stop beating during a heart attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cSudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It happens when an electrical malfunction in the heart causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart can't pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. When this occurs, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim doesn't receive treatment.\u201d\n\n\nAlso: CPR saves lives. AEDs save lives. Even if you don\u2019t have the time/money for a course, there\u2019s plenty of YouTube videos that can teach you the basics. From the CDC: \u201cYou don\u2019t need a special certification or formal training to perform CPR, but you do need education.\u201d\n\n\n\nTLDR: heart attack is a circulation problem, cardiac arrest is an electrical problem. \n\n\nReferences: \nhttps://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/heart-attack-or-sudden-cardiac-arrest-how-are-they-different\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/cpr.htm#:~:text=Give%20CPR.,normal%20position%20after%20each%20push.",

This blockage can be caused by the buildup of plaque or a blood clot. In contrast, cardiac arrest happens when the heart suddenly stops beating due to an electrical disturbance in the heart's rhythm.\n\nThe symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, pressure, or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating. In contrast, cardiac arrest causes sudden loss of consciousness, no breathing, and no pulse.\n\nThe symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, pressure, or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating.

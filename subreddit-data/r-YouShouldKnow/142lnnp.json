    "postText": "Why YSK: When you turn the water off to your exterior hose, and then leave the hose outside, the water that remains in the hose can heat up in the warm weather and easily reach temperatures of 120-140\u00b0F. \n\nAnother good idea is to turn off the water at the hose faucet with the hose or sprinkler still open so you drain as much of that water out as you can. There will still be some left behind, but it should be less.",

The Australian summer is no joke.\n\nI went outside on this 38\u00b0C day to hose down the chook yard and cool off my girls. The hose had been laying in the sun, so I knew to spray it over the lawn before I went anywhere near my hens. I'm happily cooking my neighbours weeds when the hose fucking BURST, spraying me with boiling water.\n\nIt hit my neck, my chest, and my upper arms. But the worst hit was my right forearm which instantly blistered. I ran inside and immediately drenched my wrist with cool water, hastily wetting down a towel to take care of my neck and chest. The neck and chest were fine after an hour, extremely superficial, but the wrist took a month to heal.\n\nIt's been six months and I still have a scar on my wrist from the scald. Thankfully nothing permanent, but it really stands out in the cold. Definitely one of the more horribly painful things I've had, and not one I'm keen to repeat.\n\nThe lesson here is to put your hoses away during the heat, and inspect the fittings every now and again to make sure it doesn't burst. Absolutely, one thousand percent, let the hot water run off before you do anything, but manage the risks to begin with.",

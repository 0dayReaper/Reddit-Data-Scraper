In a world where places have more dogs than ever even if the place isn\u2019t dog friendly.  They also can cite for dog related violations.  Most places, even service animals aren\u2019t allowed on the furniture or tables.  A dog in a public gym, contact the cities code compliance.  You can submit violations in most cities online.",

A few years ago folks started to complain way more about little dogs in shopping carts at Walmart. Management's response was basically that they weren't going to do anything because folks threatened to sue, claiming discrimination since the dogs were legit service animals. By and large they were full of hot air, but Walmart didn't want negative press over it.",

Basically makes it easier to contact congress with personalized faxes (which I'm told are more effective than emails, though perhaps less than phone calls).\n\nStep 1: Text Resist to 50409\n\nStep 2:\n\nYou'll need to set it up with your address so it knows who to fax.\n\nOnce that's done, reply 'congress'\n\nStep 3:\n\nWrite out a note. I suggest being kind, but firm, with positive expectations. (e.g. don't write it as if you expect them to do the wrong thing, because then this reduces the downside of doing the wrong thing!)\n\nCongress isn't directly involved - but they can stop the FCC. And so you can ask them to stop the FCC.\n\nUnique messages are better, that's why I'm not including a script to write. (I've read that if multiple people say the same thing, they just read it once, and then key it in as something like 'Form letter, 1000 submissions' whereas with unique faxes they are required to read them all.) You can make it short, just a few sentences if you want.\n\nStep 4:\n\nText 'done'\n\nStep 5:\n\nThat's it.\n\n**Option 2 - Free, slightly more time**\n\nAlternatively, call: https://www.battleforthenet.com/\n\nAlso \"Call the FCC at 888-225-5322. It'll take you through a few options, but you can talk to real person to make a formal complaint against Ajit Pai's plan.\" (Thanks drkgodess)",

Look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/7ekrpi/the_fcc_just_announced_its_plan_to_slash_net/dq5pzj5/) comment \n\n&gt; FYI - Congress and the Senate have nothing to do with this. Only five people at the FCC get to vote.\n\n&gt;[Here they are](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership). The three men plan to vote to repeal net neutrality. The two women plan to vote to keep net neutrality.\n\n&gt;Their individual contact information can be found under \"Bio\".\n\n&gt;To defeat the net neutrality repeal, one of those three men has to change their vote.\n \nI\u2019m not taking credit for this just sharing the info.",

This sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nOne easy way to help us out is just simply sharing this all around. Make everyone informed. If the entire *WORLD* hates this, it will be an even stronger case. This also helps keep other counties from falling victim to the same issues.\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t informed enough to prevent it easily here, however, people around the world can attempt to educate others on the situation. The more that know, the better.\n\nAwareness protects other counties and gives the US chance. Donations give the US even more of a chance and spread even more awareness.\n\nI encourage anyone to just mention this, to atleast a few who don\u2019t know about it. It might just be the change we globally need to prevent it from happening anywhere else.",

I live off a major highway, yet the only services offered are garbage satellite internet. I don't have wi-fi, I pay 80$ a month for unlimited 4g on my phone. Someone please explain how making ISPs competitive for their customers hurt people? It seems like removing these regulations makes the ISPs more willing to undercut competition, not the consumer. The fact that people are worried that a few companies will monopolize on being the only internet providers, when in reality they have a monopoly *now*, really confuses me.\n\nEdit: 3 hours and waiting.",

You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.\n\nThere is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.",

Here\u2019s the body of the letter that I sent. You can also use it as a script if you decide to call:\n\u201cI support \u201cTitle Two\u201d net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC\u2019s plan to repeal them. Specifically, I\u2019d like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. This issue is very dear to me and I will be watching very closely to see how you and your fellow representatives respond. Your actions on this matter will reflect how I vote during upcoming elections. I urge you to make the right decision and keep the internet free for your constituents. \u201c",

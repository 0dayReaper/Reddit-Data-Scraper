    "postText": "Edit: it's called the Working Holiday Visa \n\nWhy YSK: A working visa can be notoriously hard to get, but this allows you to go to Canada, Singapore, Ireland, Australia and/or New Zealand just because you are the youth. You can have a working visa for one year per country. Many US citizens are unaware of this!\n\nYou have to pay for the visa, and your stay, which is why it allows you to work while you're there. There are disqualifiers too, so read the visa pages of each country very carefully. \n\nOverall, it's great for travel, networking, and is especially great for someone who may want to specialize in an international field. Plus you get to explore all these beautiful countries!\n\nI wish I had been told about it before I aged out. There are so many great articles out there about this visa type, so do research and get going. See the world youthful friends! Happy travels!\n\nEdit: I believe you can register and go before you turn 31, but please check.\n\nEdit 2: for some countries it's 35 years old! SOME COUNTRIES ALSO STATE YOU MUST BE FREE OF DEPENDENTS. \n\nGo to the passport/visa website (government run) for country you're interested in and check out the qualifiers. Someone has said S. Korea and Lithuania also have similar visas. \n\nHere is one of the articles about this for some additional info, there are [many articles like this](https://www.goabroad.com/articles/jobs-abroad/working-holiday-visa#:~:text=All%20six%20countries%20where%20U.S.,time%20of%20their%20application%20submission.)\n\nEdit 3: thanks to u/sjp1980 for this link to the [NZ WHV](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/preparing-a-visa-application/working-in-nz/how-long-can-you-work-in-new-zealand-for/working-holiday-visa)\n\n[Ireland WHV](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/usa/our-services/visas/working-holiday-authorisation/)",

                            "comment": "I got a job as a dishwasher in a now closed restaurant. (It's been a decade, so....)\n\n\nI got it by making some service industry friends, and a friend of a friend said there was a position open. I did a trial shift, and I was asked to stay on. Was paid $15 or 20 under the table per hour in 2013, when AUD was equal to USD. Much more than I would've been making in my home state (7.25/hour, which was considered high minimum wage in the US at that time.) \n\n\nSince I was working under the table, I was able to work for the rest of my visa time. Got the job in February I believe, so gave me ten full months of work. \n\n\nAs for the guts to go... I was in college for a relatively demanding field, and had been taking as many credits as possible. \n\n\nI ended up having a bit of a mental break down, was very depressed, and was thinking of doing a very terrible and permanent thing... Instead I decided to visit Australia in August for a month, since I had an online friend there who encouraged me to come visit her.\n\n\nI liked it so much, that I finished my next school term and moved to Melbourne, Australia on Dec 31, 2013 for a year!\n\n\nIt was by far the best thing I could ever do for myself. I ended up being much more confident, more social. Knowing that you can move to another country with 400 dollars in your pocket and make it work is a big confidence booster ha. (You are supposed to have 5k in savings to even get the visa, but evidently they never checked my account.) You have to make new friends, you have no back up plans or anyone to lean on. It encourages self reliance and a determined attitude. I still get depressed sometimes of course, but it's never been as bad again, since living overseas.\n\n\nThen I made a couple stops through southeast Asia over the course of several months on my way home, since your can often visit with short term/no visas with a US passport.\n\n\nOn my return to the states I ended up working in food service as a result of my experience in a fast paced, high end restaurant in Melbourne, Australia. I was quickly promoted to management, and spent the last 5 years working as a trainer/new store opener; traveling all over the US; though I've recently changed careers to work as a paralegal. \n\n\nIt was a great learning experience, and I think I owe a lot of my development and self improvement due to making the blind leap and just doing it.",

Lots of broke college students do that, I\u2019ve never heard of a broke college student renting a home overseas to get a job for a couple years. \n\nIt may pay for itself eventually- but everyone knows the rich simply spend less. You need to be able to afford all the up-front first, to have the opportunity that can pay for itself. And that\u2019s not relatively inexpensive compared to how most young American people spend a long time in Europe. Is it? What am I missing?\n\nI\u2019ve heard of people *getting the job and paycheck first*, like working as a janitor or cook on a freighter ship, to travel. Racking up pay before you even get to a place. Pay first, roof over head later. But never forking up living expenses first on the hopes a job will work out after. Maybe we\u2019re just from completely different parts of society idk or maybe im missing how this works",

    "postText": "Why YSK: OSHA mandates that your employer have an area that can provide protection from a tornado, or any kind of severe storm. OSHA mandates that the company has total responsibility for your health and safety while you are at work.\n\nPeople die in tornados by trying to get home. The safest thing to do is to take shelter at your work until the storm passes. If you flee from work and get killed or injured, this will turn into an OSHA investigation.\n\nThe employer is also required to compile a record of people who are in the workplace during such a situation. Meaning they can force you to stay so that they can get a head count in case of the need for emergency recovery or rescue.\n\nThey have to train for this and provide the workers with this training as well.\n\nIf someone gets hurt or killed during a tornado, OSHA is required to do an investigation to determine if the company followed all of these requirements.\n\nhttps://www.osha.gov/tornado/preparedness",

He's far from the only one at that warehouse, and it's strange no one else was harmed. \n\nNot saying the company doesn't have fault in the issue, but for peoples' safety no matter *where* you are (govt facility, community center, corporate premise, residential area) it's best to prevent people from leaving and to get people into a bulky, central area away from windows. I'd be curious if there's more to this story than the sensationalized \"Amazon literally killed a guy by chaining him to his desk\" stuff I've seen.",

Tornadoes are narrow and unpredictable. You don\u2019t know that the tornado is going to threaten your life until it is practically on top of you. The safest place to be in a tornado (aside from \u201cmany miles away from the tornado\u201d) is inside of a building. In a car trying to flee is one of the least safe places to be. And tornado watches and warnings are constant in tornado prone areas. If people in tornado alley were sent home from work every time there was a tornado watch or warning, in addition to that being homicidally dangerous, absolutely nothing would ever get done. The wind blows in a town on the other side of the state and you get a tornado watch.",

I\u2019ve spent my entire life in tornado alley and I\u2019ve never seen a tornado watch or warning issued the day before. The best you\u2019ll get is a forecast that severe thunderstorms will be in the area that far in advance. Even then tornado watches are mostly ignored as they\u2019re issued all the time without a tornado occurring. Tornado warnings are different but they generally won\u2019t get issued unless a tornado is on the ground or rotation has been spotted. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve never seen happen hours in advance and you only get that warning, if you\u2019re lucky, with 30 minutes or so to spare.",

There's a nuance to every situation and if I know ahead of time, I'm leaving and won't be stopped. If it's an EF4 or 5, if you can't get underground then your best bet is to get out of the way. Ryan Hall is a great one to listen to during storms.  We have gotten weather science down to a tee. It's incredible. He called the outbreaks a couple days ago near a week before it happened.",

That\u2019s probably a decent chance to get home for most people, but I wouldn\u2019t call it WAAAAY ahead of time.\n\nKnowing that the potential exists for a tornado is not the same as knowing when and where a tornado will occur which is what the person I responded to was insinuating. I won\u2019t argue that weather tracking is far better than it was even when I was a kid, but no meteorologist will claim to be able to tell you where or when or how long a tornado\u2019s life will be hours much less a day before it will touch down. Maybe a general area but nothing for people to be able to make an informed decision.",

WAAAAY ahead of time is over exaggerating though I did think they had more time than that according to a little documentary I watched. But even 20 minutes is a lot of time if the weather man says \"get under ground or bug out\". And I've been following weather a lot lately and I don't know if the science itself is better or if they can just read it all better because I've been floored at the accuracy of the last few outbreaks. It's crazy. Regardless, like I said, nuance...every situation is different. But overall yes I would take my best bet which is to stay put. If they tell me it's a big ole monster like El Reno, Joplin, etc...I'd weigh my options and might try to flee. I wish I had a basement! Or a cellar. I used to live in an un anchored trailer and always went to my mom's house before every storm just in case it was bad. I'm not so fearful now that I've learned a lot more. These storms are getting crazy though. The night of Mayfield, I walked outside (I live in KY,  tornado passed about 3 miles north of me) and the air was thick and heavy and it was almost sparking. We had walked out to go to Walmart and we ended up not going shopping. An hour later it ran through the state. Nobody in my county died. I was shocked. Turns out it hand kind of \"powered down\" to an EF2 after hitting Bremen,  it went through my mom's town and then near by our house. It destroyed my cousin's home but thankfully she did what I always did and was at her momma's.",

It is like that on paper, but not in practice. It's really the only aspect of the job she hates, and led to her going down to part-time after being full-time a few months. Patients have rights in theory, but it's entirely dependent on the doctor. My mom spends more time with the patients than the doctors do, (hell, some patients don't even get to see the doctors in person and only one on telehealth) and yet it's the doctors are who have 100% control over the patients' lives.\n\nIf a patient there voluntarily asks to be discharged, there's a 24 hours waiting period, which also excludes weekends. And if a doctor wants to keep them longer after that, they can. That does mean seeking a court order, but it's still all up to the doctor because the judge is basically just a rubber stamp that signs off on whatever the doctor says without asking for any type of proof. Of course there's patients that genuinely need to be kept longer for their own well-being, but my mom has also seen patients get completely railroaded and forced to stay longer with no reason.",

OSHA mandates that the company has total responsibility for your health and safety while you are at work.\n\nNo it doesn't. OSHA provides recommendations, but there is no requirement that a tornado shelter be provided.\n\n&gt;People die in tornados by trying to get home. The safest thing to do is to take shelter at your work until the storm passes. If you flee from work and get killed or injured, this will turn into an OSHA investigation.\n\nNo... first, there is no such thing as \"fleeing\" from work. You are free to come and go as you please. OSHA has zero mandate or authority to investigate something that happens outside of the workplace, so you getting hurt in your car on the way home would not lead to an OSHA investigation.\n\n&gt;The employer is also required to compile a record of people who are in the workplace during such a situation. Meaning they can force you to stay so that they can get a head count in case of the need for emergency recovery or rescue.\n\nLol. Certain employers are required to have emergency response plan, first nowhere does the OSHA mandate mention tornados at all. And the primary element of these plans is that an employer must have a way to communicate fires and plans in place if they have to keep any equipment running during an emergency. Employers are required to have a procedure to account for all employees after an evacuation... there, however is no enforcement mechanism, the procedure can say all it wants, all employees check in with Janet from HR... all OSHA requires is that you have that plan, neither OSHA or your employer has the authority to imprison and/or hold you hostage.\n\n&gt;They have to train for this and provide the workers with this training as well.\n\nSwing and a miss. \n\n&gt;If someone gets hurt or killed during a tornado, OSHA is required to do an investigation to determine if the company followed all of these requirements.\n\nAgain, no OSHA requiments cover tornados and there is no investigation avenue for employees that die from a tornado.",

It was easy to reunite with the owner, because there was a text message sent to its lock screen with a name and phone number to call if found. \n\nObviously, that won't work in every scenario. But it's definitely worth a shot if your phone is ever lost-lost.",

From the Lock Screen, you select \u201cEmergency\u201d then \u201cMedical ID\u201d. Mine has my full name and my emergency contact, which you can also click to dial from my phone from that screen without unlocking it.

You click on that and if they have set it up can find name, age, medical info, and emergency contacts. It was super easy to set up and I\u2019ve had to use it once when I had a severe panic attack in the grocery store. One of the employees called 911 and the paramedics were able to figure out my info/how to help me bc of the emergency info on my phone. I was completely unresponsive despite being conscious so it was a big help. My husband was in the store with me but In a different area so they were able to find him and he calmed me down pretty quick.\n\nEdit. I just checked bc I felt like I was saying that wrong and emergency comes up on the Lock Screen and then \u201cmedical ID\u201d. I have both my husband and my mom listed on there with their number and it let me label them as \u201cspouse\u201d and \u201cmom\u201d. It also let me put my name and birthdate (which it converted to my age) medical diagnosis and at least a couple of meds that I\u2019m taking.",

This just gave me the name of the owner which I den tried to google. Then I tried Siri to \u201ecall Mom\u201c. After a nice chat with the owners Mom, we agreed that I deposit the phone at a near ski lift. \nBack on my walk I then ran into the actual owner.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: When working in car sales whenever we received the results of our survey back, we could see the response answers that the customer provided. If a question asks you, how would you rate your experience 1-10 and you put a 9, the salesperson will get chewed out by their guest services coordinator. I thought I would make this post for people who think (rightfully so) that 7-9 are considered good scores and shows you had a pleasant experience, but this actually reflects very poorly on the salesperson. I am not saying that this system is just or even right, just the reality of the situation that a lot of salespeople have to deal with. Yes, I know dealerships are considered scummy. If you happen to be at a dealership and you actually want to help your salesperson out, give them a perfect score. If you happen to very much so dislike your salesperson, an outright lowest score on one or even many questions could result in them being either demoted or straight out fired, so take this into consideration when you give out very negative scores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note YSK: I do not recommend going to dealerships for this reason among other reasons. For the people who will suggest going to Carvana for price or just not dealing with salespeople, Carvana is also known as being a very poor company to work with even though their prices seem fair. Many of their vehicles have service issues and you do not actually get to test drive or know the details on the mechanical side until you actually receive the vehicle. Look up horror stories about Carvana.",

It's so they can tout how highly rated they are in their advertising but it's all meaningless bullshit because they guilt customers into giving those scores. How many people would be rated 10/10 in any job? The last car salesman I dealt with lied, avoided giving direct answers until I picked up my keys and headed for the door and I'm expected to give that guy a perfect score? Get outta here...\n\nIt's a stupid system and rather than go along more people should just refuse to participate.",

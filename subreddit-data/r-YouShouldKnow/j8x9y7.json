    "postText": "Why YSK: This information helped me a lot, because I am studying psychology and I began to wake up a lot, so much that I barely slept two or three hours a day for work and study, to the point that I began to create false memories of things that I had supposedly done, that I had read, which he had seen, but they were false memories. \n\nA fellow student realized what was happening and sent me to read the study and from there I began to sleep for more hours, so you should know that this information will be useful at some point in case you sleep very few hours or in the case that you hear a false memory of another person. In my case, when someone remembers something that has not happened or that nobody has said, the first thing I do is ask how many hours they sleep.\n\nSource: https://time.com/3328149/sleep-deprivation-false-memories/\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/264010267_Sleep_Deprivation_and_False_Memories\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768102/",

When I was having a really bad time with my depression, I would often get little to no sleep, and dreams I had started becoming memories for me. When I mentioned something I thought happened to a friend or my mom, they'd always get so confused.",

He got obsessed with it trying to work out what was wrong and his wife got very upset and hysterical, but then he eventually realised because of the lamp, that none of it was real, then he woke up, and he was on the ground after being knocked out in the original fight, and he had been unconscious for a very short time.

Your body just bounces back way more easy, but it gets less and less.\nWork on your day rhythm, get to bed and wake up at set times for a week, no screen time an hour/half hour before bed, no alcohol or caffeine before bed and eat something as soon as you wake up. These things can help to 'life hack' your rhythm back in place.\nNot sleepy enough in the evening? I sometimes have some herbal tea to help with that. Chamomile for instance (it's an acquired taste), just try not to self medicate with stuff like melatonin before you talk to a professional about it.. (and so sorry for the rando advice, I just recognize so much of myself on your comment~).",

Some things that help me in the event they help you as well:\n-\tTry to plan your night-after-sleep-days for indoor, solo stuff since you will be feeling depressed. So stuff around the house or my days off, I\u2019ll plan around those.\n-\ttry to schedule days you want to feel best on days you do wake therapy. Very very hard to do but it can be done if you are mindful enough \n-\tdon\u2019t push things. I can\u2019t do more than 2 days. You\u2019ll want to because you won\u2019t want to return to the depression but long term, try to remember this is a tool and not something to indulge in, because it can catch up with you. \n-\ttry to make sure the anxiety about the lack of sleep (i.e. health concerns about not sleeping) is managed. Often I\u2019ll feel worse when worrying about it rather than making myself....\n-\tbe appreciative we can at least have something that lets us function on some days in a decent mood. Some aren\u2019t so lucky and many of them are my clients and they have 0 tools besides cycling through SSRIs and deep breathing coping skills. Appreciation for sleep therapy helps the whole process. \n\nHope that helps. Please reach out to The National Suicide Hotline and the Lifeline Chat if you ever need immediate help",

Let me tell you what happened. \n\nI was doing night shifts at a factory, 8 hours + traveling time 2 hours by bus. My sleep during the day was always around 6-7 hours. Then I had this exam coming in a two months, so I started a class in the evening. I come home 5 hours sleep and go to class.\n \nI also had to do some documentation work for my visa that involved long essay writing. So now I started sleeping alternate days. My sleep was full of dreams then after a while I started having sleep paralysis way more often than I ever had. I still didn't think that this was happening due to sleep. Not just my memory was real weak but I had to put too much effort to keep my self going through the day.\n \nNow one weekend I realized I'm very much behind in paper work that I was doing so I should finish it by next weekend. Here I did the biggest mistake. I stopped sleeping. For a week. When Friday came I started hallucinating things like people are following me, or my work place is conspiring against me so I will lose my job, or someone kidnapped my whole family back in home country.... These few of the examples but I had really vivid hallucinations for two days. And my actions were literally like a crazy person. \n\nLuckily I was living with housemates and they called police who then called ambulance because I was talking and trying to self harm. I ended up waking in a psych ward. It took me three months to realize that whatever happened was just hallucinations and everything was normal except me.\nI still don't have clear memory of those two days there are many holes in my memory of that time. \n\nAnd I learned lesson for life not to ignore sleep. I'm still on sleep medication and have to take it for at least one year. Don't really don't mess with your sleep.",

I had pulled tons of all nighters and bad finals weeks and all that, but with a newborn there is *no. Relief. Whatsoever.* There is never a point where you catch up the lost sleep. At least if you\u2019re breastfeeding exclusively and trying to get baby to gain weight. By week 3 I was hooking up my pump to eke out 3oz for a bottle my husband could give our baby so I could have a slightly longer stretch of sleep. \n\nThe worst was when I was so tired but would go to bed and just lay there. My mind wouldn\u2019t shut off to drift off and I would start crying thinking my brain had finally broken and it didn\u2019t know how to sleep anymore. \n\nIf we have another baby I\u2019m getting a night nurse. I literally don\u2019t know how other moms do it, but maybe they all had easier babies than I did? My second is almost a year now and has slept through the night a total of 3 times in the last year. THREE. \n\nSleep deprivation for new parents is laughed off as some joke \u201chaha you\u2019ll never sleep again\u201d and to those people I just say FUCK YOU. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s not funny that I\u2019m hallucinating animals skittering across my house. It\u2019s not funny to be crying because you think your brain is broken. It\u2019s not funny when despite all this you still have to be calm and nurturing because the sleep deprivation makes you more likely to snap and hurt your baby. Just fuck off with this \u201cjoke\u201d and offer to bring food or Starbucks or be a sympathetic ear or just don\u2019t say anything at all.",

You can die, suffer permanent brain damage, changes of personality, obesity, psychotic phases, you name it. Sleep deprivation is a known method of torture, practiced mainly in totalitarian regimes to 'break' their enemies and render them mentally crippled for live without too much of physical evidence.

It's a very misunderstood (if known at all) diseases by both the general public and medical professionals, leading to a LOT of narcoleptics being either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. There are several reasons for that: it's a pretty rare disease, narcoleptics often think/assume some of the symptoms are normal, and it often comes with fractured night time sleep or insomnia. Narcoleptics who sleep through the night just fine still end up with a lot of sleep deprivation symptoms anyway because they get very little, if any, deep sleep.\n\n\nIt's probably worth looking into if you experience Excessive Daytime Sleepiness after getting plenty of sleep for several nights, especially if you experience Sleep Attacks (sudden almost or completely irresistible need to sleep, the best way I can describe it is as if you accidentally took a mild to very powerful sleep aid/drug). There are a lot of other symptoms but that's usually the most debilitating and is present in Type 1 and Type 2 narcolepsy, unlike Cataplexy. It's sometimes compared to a normal person staying awake for 48 - 72 hours or only sleeping 3 - 5 hours/night for several weeks.",

Sleep deprivation causes lower tolerance towards noise.\n\nI live in a noisy neighbourhood and the only time for any peace and quiet is during the ungodly hours of the night. Because of that I always end up sleeping at 2am despite needing to get up at 7am.\n\nNeedless to say my health was bad, plus for the longest time attributed my low tolerance towards noise as autism related aural sensitivity (my hearing is so sharp I can hear conversations a few houses away). After listening to a TED talk on the importance of sleep, figured I got nothing to lose and gave sleeping early a go.\n\nThe difference can be felt just from one night! Apart from having more energy, the best part is I have a higher tolerance towards noise. The sharp hearing had long been a source of torment and now it's actually manageable. Still annoying, but at least I don't go into meltdowns as frequently. So yeah, make time for sleep!",

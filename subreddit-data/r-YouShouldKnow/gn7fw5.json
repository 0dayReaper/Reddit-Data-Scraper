    "postText": "Have a Samsung smart TVs with ads that were annoying as hell. Found out they can be blocked and tried it. It worked!\n\n\nEdit: WOW! This blew up way more than I expected. I had no idea so many people hated their \u201cSmart TVs\u201d. I\u2019m glad this information was useful to everyone!\n\nAlso thank you for all the upvotes, awards and comments. Hopefully this becomes common knowledge and people can take back control of their TVs!\n\nEdit 2: another link you can add to your block list is samsungads.com. Combined with the above link you *should* be entirely ad free.\n\nEdit 3: So A TON of people are asking how to block ads on other TV\u2019s/Devices. Ive compiled a few \u201cHow To\u2019s\u201d for LG, ROKU and Fire Stick. Hope this helps everyone struggling with these damn ads!\n\n**LG**: To disable LG ads that appear in \"My Content\" tab, LG store etc. blacklist/block the following domains on your router: \n\nngfts.lge.com\n\nus.ad.lgsmartad.com\n\nlgad.cjpowercast.com\n\nedgesuite.net\n\nus.info.lgsmartad.com\n\n\n**Roku:** If you go into the privacy settings on your Roku TV you can turn these ads off, but it also turns off the more ways to watch feature. To turn this off go to your\u00a0Settings\u00a0and select\u00a0Privacy. There you will find an option to\u00a0\u201cUse Information From TV Inputs.\u201d Turning that off should disable these pop-up ads. (Not the best but its something)\n\n**Amazon Fire Stick:**\nThis requires you to download an app but it will work. Go to downloader and search for (~~)&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;strike&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;s&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\u201chttp://stop and.io\u201d.\u2014\u2014-Click \u201cblocks ads now\u201d and you will be taken to the download page(~~) \u2014\u2014Thanks to u/jtn19120 for the update! (See below)\n\nGo to http://blokada.org via Downloader instead, scroll down, install the latest\u2014\u2014\u2014That\u2019s it!\n\nEdit 4: Everyone\u2019s router is going to be different when it comes to blocking/blacklisting domains (websites, etc) as far as i know there\u2019s no \u201cone size fits all scenario\u201d BUT there\u2019s hope.\n\nLocate your router and flip it upside down (literally) on the bottom there should be a URL/website you use to login to your router and make changes (this is how you configure your WiFi names, create passwords, etc) within the same settings there should be a \u201csecurity\u201d tab or something along the lines (Netgear has the security tab under \u201cAdvanced\u201d) from there you should see a block sites/block services tab. Click on the block sites tab (Netgear) and type in the domain (the ones I provided) and add them. That\u2019s it. Let me see if i can locate the instructions for more popular routers and I\u2019ll be back!\n\nEdit 5: Ok I think I was able to find a \u201cuniversal\u2014ish\u201d guide to blocking sites on your router.\n\n1. Open your router's configuration page. If the sites you want to block aren't encrypted, you can usually block them using your router's built-in tools. To access these, open the router's configuration page in a web browser on a computer that's connected to your network. \n\nCommon router addresses include:\n\nLinksys - http://192.168.1.1\n\nD-Link/Netgear - http://192.168.0.1\n\nBelkin - http://192.168.2.1\n\nASUS - http://192.168.50.1/\n\nAT&amp;T U-verse - http://192.168.1.254\n\nComcast - http://10.0.0.1\n\n**If you have a router that\u2019s not listed, do a quick google search and you will find your router login information**\n\n2. Enter your router's login information. If you never changed this information, enter in the default administrator account information. For many routers, this is usually \"admin\" or blank for the username, and \"admin\" or blank for the password. Check your router's documentation if you don't know the default login information. (THIS IS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO SECURE YOUR ROUTER WITH A STRONG USERNAME AND PASSWORD FYI!)\n\n3. Find the \"URL Filtering\" or \"Blocking\" section. The location of this will vary depending on your router. You may find this in the \"Firewall\" menu, or in the \"Security\" section. (SEARCH AROUND, ITS THERE I PROMISE)\n\n4. Add the URLs that you want to block. Enter each URL that you want to block on your connected devices. (THIS IS WHERE YOU ENTER THE ADDRESS I PROVIDED)\n\n5. Click save and thats it!\n\n\nEdit 6: \n\nSony/Android TV ad removal\n\n1- Go into Settings &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Apps 2- Find \"Android TV Core Services\" 3- Roll back all updates on it (will warn you that you're rolling back to initial version... skip over that... you don't want it.) 4- Return to the Home screen and remove the Sponsored \"channel\" by clicking far left on the row and using the minus (-) button. 5- Return to Apps in Settings and look for \"Android TV Core Services\" again. 6- Force Stop it and then DISABLE it.\n\nEdit 7: Here are more Samsung URLs to add to the block list since everyone has a different model Tv \n\nwww.samsungotn.net\n\nwww.samsungrm.net\n\nwww.samsung.net/ads\n\nEdit 8: OMG this is the 12th most popular post in the WORLD today on Reddit! I can\u2019t believe that over 75k people have enjoyed this information. I am truly amazed and thankful for everyone I was able to help! This is amazing!",

You accidentally sign up when setting up the TV. \n\nRelevant investigative journalism piece on it\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/business/media/tv-viewer-tracking.html\n\nEmphasis my own:\n\n&gt; **Samba TV has struck deals with roughly a dozen TV brands \u2014 including Sony, Sharp, TCL and Philips** \u2014 to place its software\u00a0on certain sets. **When people set up their TVs, a screen urges them to enable a service called Samba Interactive TV, saying it recommends shows and provides special offers \u201cby cleverly recognizing onscreen content.\u201d But the screen, which contains the enable button, does not detail how much information Samba TV collects to make those recommendations.**\n\n&gt; Samba TV declined to provide recent statistics, but one of its executives\u00a0said at the end of 2016\u00a0that **more than 90 percent of people opted in.**\n\n&gt; **Once enabled, Samba TV can track nearly everything that appears on the TV on a second-by-second basis, essentially reading pixels to identify network shows and ads, as well as programs on HBO and even video games played on the TV. Samba TV has even offered advertisers the ability to base their targeting on whether people watch conservative or liberal media outlets and which party\u2019s presidential debate they watched**.\n\n&gt; The big draw for advertisers \u2014 which have included **Citi and JetBlue in the past, and now Expedia \u2014 is that Samba TV can also identify other devices in the home that share the TV\u2019s internet connection.\n**",

Samba presumably has a program installed baked into the OS for tracking. If there is an update, Samsung or whoever would have to cross check the Samba server to see if there is a more up to date version. The same way Windows can get driver updates from Nvidia for example.\n\n256 back and forths seems a bit suspect though. Again wishful thinking, but it could just be constantly checking because it's blocked by your host file. Stuck in a loop because it can't connect to the server.\n\nBut again I have no idea and this is just wishful thinking. Would be interesting to see if this behaviour changes if you enable it for a day.",

It still would work on anything Ethernet as well right? \n\nSorry for the probably basic questions but I just want to make sure and clarify some things as well.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your answers, they are incredibly helpful.

Just need old laptop or maybe pi https://pi-hole.net . just another tip came to mind youtube ads are the most annoying on tv's sideload smartyoutube https://smartyoutubetv.github.io/ and you will never see youtube ads in your life i almost forgot about ads :)\n\nEdit 1 : YouTube ads can be disabled on mobile phone by installing youtube vanced visit vanced.app (there are other open source clients as well)\n\nEdit 2 :  easier and automated installation https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/README.md . But keep in mind you still have to configure dns settings on router or maybe use pi hole dhcp(credit u/call_da_ambalampss)\n\nEdit 3 : installing smart youtube on android tv \nWell the easy way is download apk from https://smartyoutubetv.github.io just transfer it to tv (i like to use File commander and upload my apk to google drive and then use File commander drive option) and just install the apk . It will work if you can't see it you maybe need a sideload launcher search for sideload launcher in play store\n\nAlternative is install aptoide tv https://tv.aptoide.com (its a third party store) and then you can just use it as play store just search for smart youtube and install it",

To put it simply let's say you want to call a company and you don't know their phone number what you will? Pick up the phone book. In the same manner, each device who wish to access any content online has to know the address from where they want the material how they do it? Same but its called DNS request (think it as same as phone book where there are the company name and their number ). What happens If I rip a specific page from the phone directory ? there you go you can't call the company anymore. This is what pi hole basically do so they block all the dns request made by devices who are trying to load ads . I hope this will help . https://blog.cryptoaustralia.org.au/instructions-for-setting-up-pi-hole/ this is quite alot but if you managed to set it up you life will be much better . You can ask me any question if you need help\n\n\nEdit 1 : pi hole replace the correct server IP of ad hosting server with a fake one.(credit u/Zitter_Aalex)",

You will have to explicitly turn that off manually everywhere.\n\n  \n\n\nOh, and pihole is showing you things much worse than the ads. Roku talking to logger/tracking services every 30s, and at every button push. TikTok (which is only on a single phone in our 50 internet devices household) is responsible for half the dns queries, hundreds of obvious trackers in China.\n\nOur pihole is blocking about 40% of dns queries. Maybe once a week there is a problem with something not working due to pihole. But there are browser addons and phone apps to pause it for a minute.\n\nIt is insane and very concerning what is going on. I have written software for 20 years and kept everything ad/track/spy free, no 3rd party addons that collect data.",

They look identical and you have to really drill in to the specifications.\n\nAnd I'd guess that's why TV manufacturers give their products really obtuse model names like UE325C100CQW, so buyers can't eaisly work out exactly what it is they're getting.",

Their 6 series TVs were so incredible for the money cause they bundled them with a banner ad on the right hand side of the main landing screen before selecting a app/channel/input. Annoying, but easy enough to ignore. Genuinely no big deal. This week they decided to fill in a little more space on the bottom left with another ad and now the slippery slope has begun taking its course.",

But like \"you don't need it.\" \"You don't want to\" etc etc. Also get angry when I did something wrong or not how he had it in mind (even when say i had a more logical plan in mind that didn't require brute force).\n\nHe literally cut himself open on an ikea screw while he was helping me build an ikea bed. Ya know. Trying to.get it straight.  (Something you can't do alone). While.he was gone to bring away my old bed, me and my mom nearly finished it. Ok my brother helped a bit too.\nNot reading instructions. Taking the time to think through the steps. And not listening to me.when i said \"hey. I think we need to do this first and then that part.\" Or \"i believe we need to use this thing for that.\"\n\nOnly time he asked me for help was wiring internet cables. Of course not involved with the line pulling etc. I jist had to order em neatly by colour in the pattern. He.had already tried but had me check, since he is colourblind, which made it harder. Also didn't let me see the full kit which had something he didn't know what it was. It was a tiny tool to more easily put it in rather than pushing with your nail.....\nThey are always really suprised i can read basic instructions... i study lab stuff. Where you constantly follow instructions, and make them... just because i am a girl....\n\n\nWhen i once said to my mom \"i think i need to be able to do everything myself.\" She was like. \"Well i kinda get it. I just am over it. It isn't necesarry though. A man can just do it.\"\nI will probably live alone for most of my life (i actually want to. i like the idea. Of completely independant.) Or chances are with a woman (am bi) no way i am going to rely on having a relationship with a man that can do that shit....",

Sob stories, exaggerations, self-deprecation, it all grabs attention and makes people more likely to upvote.  Then when you remember that probably less than 20% of the people who voted on the content will even enter the comments, and there's just no incentive to be \"honest\".\n\nReddit even integrated a built-in cross-posting feature to make it even easier for people to do this.  The system is built from the ground up for clickbait and emotional appeal.",

Eventually, your father will relent and allow you to try to work on the task, but he'll give you half-assed instructions and again, he'll become increasingly agitated as you ask more questions and fail to intuitively know how to complete the task.

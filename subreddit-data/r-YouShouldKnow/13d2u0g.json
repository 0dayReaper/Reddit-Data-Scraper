    "postText": " **Why YSK:** In the U.S., most personal injury attorneys will bombard you with ads claiming \"free consultations,\" and while it is true that you will not pay the attorney anything, attorneys typically take about 33% of the settlement you get from the insurance company. They may also encourage you to seek more treatment than what is necessary. The only thing the attorney is doing on your behalf is collecting medical bills and talking to the insurance company when your treatment has concluded, and it is time to negotiate a settlement. If you are able to keep up with your medical bills - which you should be - and as long as your injury is not significant, you should save a lot of money by negotiating a settlement with the insurance company by not retaining an attorney. The key is to wait until all your treatment is concluded before accepting a settlement. The insurance company will still reimburse you for all reasonable medical bills and lost wages, and you will be able to negotiate a pain &amp; suffering payment for the stress that the process caused. Just be sure to do a little research on how much of a pain &amp; suffering payment is reasonable for your case. Ask around and use the Internet. Many people have been in your shoes before. If, based on your research, you feel like you are getting the runaround or an unfair settlement, then it may be time to review your case with an attorney. I have worked for a P&amp;C insurance company for over a decade, and I am frustrated by the amount of money people lose by getting an attorney.",

The insurance company can argue that since you walked away from it you don't need any money to compensate.\n\nAnd going to the internet for legal advice instead of someone who actually knows the laws and regulations in your area? Please, think about that for half a second.",

If you feel like you're not getting a fair settlement, that's when you should contact an attorney, but you'd be surprised how much insurance companies are willing to negotiate. Everyone is conditioned to think attorneys are protecting you. That's BS. Head over to r/insurance and review some of the discussion about this topic. We're not a bunch of \"insurance lobbyists\" as another commenter claimed. We're just trying to inform consumers from the other side of things.",

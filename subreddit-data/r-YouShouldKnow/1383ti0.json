    "postText": "Why YSK: You've probably heard this word used far too often as just a synonym for the state of being large. It actually means things outside the norm, often in a negative connotation.  \n[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enormity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enormity)  \n\n\n&gt; [Synonyms of *enormity*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/enormity)  \n**1:** an outrageous, improper, vicious, or immoral act  \n**2:** the quality or state of being immoderate, monstrous, or outrageous *especially* **:** great wickedness  \n**3:** the quality or state of being huge **:** [**IMMENSITY**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immensity)  \n**4:** a quality of momentous importance or impact\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; *Enormity*, some people insist, is improperly used to denote large size. They insist on *enormousness* for this meaning, and would limit *enormity* to the meaning \"great wickedness.\" Those who urge such a limitation may not recognize the subtlety with which *enormity* is actually used. It regularly denotes a considerable departure from the expected or normal.",

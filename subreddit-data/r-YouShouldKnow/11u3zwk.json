    "postText": "Why ysk: migraines cause a host of nervous system issues, several of which affect your eyes and vision. One side effect of migraines can be benign episodic unilateral mydriasis, which causes one pupil to dilate abnormally. You've probably heard of something similar happening when a person gets a concussion - rest assured, if this happens with a migraine it isn't a sign of anything serious.\n\nBut unless you're a severe case or just so happen to get an eye exam while you're suffering from a migraine, you might not even know you have it. Even the tiniest dilation can affect your sensitivity to light, or you might involuntary squint and tighten the muscles in your face. As your brain takes in slightly different images from your eyes and fails to reconcile them, it can significantly increase your migraine pain. \n\nAn eye patch is an easy, quick, and cheap solution. Wear it on the side of your face that is causing pain. They're available at most drug stores and cause zero side effects with prolonged use. Wearing one could reduce or even eliminate your light sensitivity. Your brain not having any input from one eye can also cut down on overall pain and reduce the urge to squint. It's definitely worth a try if you have $10 to spare and may help with resuming normal activities despite the migraine.\n\nObligatory: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133519/",

                                                    "comment": "There are a couple complex reasons for this but as a person who has been down this long rabbit hole, I can explain two of the main causes:\n\nOne type of migraine is a tension migraine or a tension headache. \n\nFor people with overly flexible joints, it tends to originate from a condition called [hypermobility / Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/).\n\nThis condition affects collagen, connective tissue, which is found almost everywhere in the body.  There are 13 different subtypes with different genetic causes and different presentations, but flexible joints tends to be universal. \n\nNormally our joints and ligaments give a sturdy structure to our bodies.  They help keep us in a fixed position.  Imagine yourself sitting at a desk typing on a computer.  Your spine, your neck, your head - these aren't moving, and so *something* is keeping them in that very fixed position. \n\nFor non-hypermobile people, this is their connective tissue.  Like a very tight rubber band, it provides pull and tension that keeps you upright with almost no actual *effort*. \n\nHowever, think about that same situation, but now the elastic bands are very, very stretchy. \n\nSo instead of your head being kept easily upright and looking at your computer, it wants to bob forward.  Because the tension in the elastic band is simply not there. \n\nBut, you need to keep your head up.  So, we activate stabilizer muscles.  These are muscles that help keep our body parts in a fixed position. \n\nFor nonhypermobile people, these muscles barely have to work at all.  But when you have hypermobility, these muscles are actually doing MOST of the work. \n\nSo after sitting eight hours at a desk, a hypermobile person is putting extraordinary exertion on stabilizer muscles that are over-compensating for hypermobile ligaments and tendons that are unable to stabilize. \n\nThis is where the trouble comes in.  Those muscles, overworked and exhausted, tend to spasm, as overburdened muscles do. \n\nFor me, I tend to suffer from tension headaches on the left side of my body.  That is because my left side of my body, shoulder, neck, elbow, are especially hyper-mobile, and so eight hours of sitting at a desk puts severe pressure on the stabilizer muscles responsible for keeping it all together. \n\nWhen these muscles spasm, they tend to cause inflammation, and they can also squeeze and choke the nerves in the region too.  Inflammation + pressure on the nerve, and et voila, migraine. \n\nThe migraine forces us to rest, and so the migraine tends to pass within a few days, because you are allowing the muscles to rest and recover.  And then usually the cycle starts again.\n\nThere is another condition that can also exacerbate this, and tends to accompany hypermobility, and its called [POTS, or postural tachycardia Sydrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots). \n\nThis condition is an autonomic nervous system disorder.  In a very simplified nutshell, it means your veins and arteries do not contract or dilate as they should. \n\nThe most obvious symptom for people ar edegrees of lightheadedness when they stand up suddenly. \n\nBut there are much more far-reachig affects.  One of the biggest effects of the condition is that it affects the water/sodium balance in the body, such that people with POTS tend to need to drink far more water and take in far more sodium / electrolytes than people without it. \n\nThis can also contribute to a migraine, because poor electrolytic balance can cause muscle spasms and some of the intense pain accompanying tension headaches. \n\nBecause tendon / ligament tension takes no energy, but because muscles DO, even just sitting down, you're working much harder than someone without hypermobility, and your body is not as efficient with its electrolytes, and so its a perfect cocktail for migraines.\n\nHere [is a great podcast about a woman suffering from migraines](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/case-04-shelby/id1648107550?i=1000584491233) who turned out to have POTS.  This episode may ring true for a number of people dealing with this condition who aren't aware they have it.",

No matter how small or seemingly insignificant?\n\nAnd is the migraine located ONLY to the head?  Or does it ever radiate, in any degree, down into your left neck / shoulder / arm?\n\nEven if it's just increased stiffness or heaviness or otherwise feelings of \"not quite rightness\" in the muscles of the neck or shoulder or arm?\n\nI am not a doctor, but I have a few thoughts: \n\n* Based on your description, your head injury may not have been the *cause* of your migraines. It may, in fact, just have been a stressor that resulted in your first incidence of tension headaches brought on primarily by hypermobility / POTS.  The relationship may have seemed causal and that would be perfectly logical, but this may not be the case.  Especially because you are also hypermobile and you have specific one-side migraines.  For example, I took a fall during football a very long time ago that kicked off back pain which also led to migraines.  But the instability in my joints was there from the start; the sports injury just exacerbated it when I went to kick the ball and took a tumble.  That joint instability led to stresses in my back stabilizer muscles which made migraines more likely, but did not necessarily caused them.  They could have occurred on their own, but tweaking my back made them rush in.  I have never suffered a head injury in my life, however, but I am hypermobile and I have exactly the same migraine conditions as you.\n\n* 15 months ago (or some time before that), you may have had something that affected your autonomic regulation.  This would cause your nervous system to less effectively regulate water / electrolytes.   A minor viral infection that caused an immune response that may have triggered autoimmune issues that you have had for some time.  \n\n* Or it is possible that 15 months ago you made some small change - a new regiment, starting sitting for longer periods of time, got a new chair or desk, or a new bed or pillow, even a new computer monitor which sits at a different height than before and causes you to keep your neck in a new position for long periods of time - which hasn't caused a noticeable change in your day-to-day, but *is* putting more stress on your stabilizer muscles than existed before, and as such, is thrusting you into the cycle of migraines again.\n\nI only say all of this because your situation is almost identical to mine, down to the letter, and I spent quite a great deal of time and energy going down the neurology rabbit hole when at the end of the day it really had nothing to do with my brain. \n\nI, too, had some minor lesions on brain scans.  The radiologist said at the time it *could* indicate MS, but was not definitive.  However follow-ups have concluded that it is the migraines themselves causing the minor scarring, and not the scarring causing the migraines. \n\nI have definitively pinned my left-side migraines down to tension headaches, and have pretty much mapped out all the triggers and stressors.  I used to get them every two weeks.  Now, it's very rare I get them, and when I do, I can usually trace it back to something - for instance, once I got a new video game on Switch I was playing day after day after day for too long.  The position of me hunched over my Switch for too long triggered the spasms in my muscles.",

That is, medical professionals are not 100% sure the mechanisms of action by which viral infections lead to autonomic disregulation, but the correlation is extremely high and there is very little doubt about the connection.\n\nThe fact you are fitting the pattern to a T seems unlikely to me to be coincidence.\n\nYou are hypermobile, and very likely may have POTS.  You had a viral infection at around the same time the migraines intensified, which can absolutely result in a long-term augmentations to your immune system which are exacerbating your autonomic disregulatory condition.",

The test for it is basically whether or not you respond to nerve blocks. They're just small injections at the back of your head. It was the first relief I can remember having in years. And the fact that they came back suggested that it was enough to warrant a surgery. The surgeries are outpatient and between 1 and 4 hours depending on where they're located. The nerves often have muscle fibers or other fascia growing over them, kind of locking them or tying them down. It then makes them very irritated, causing pain and migraines. I've had problems in my neck and shoulders for a decade or so from working at a computer, and apparently that's not uncommon. Good luck!",

I've not really dealt with all that because I developed a coping mechanism called suppression, meaning that if I started getting double vision when looking at something, I'd ignore the visual input of one eye, and therefore didn't show any strong signs of it. Therefore, it went undiagnosed until my mid twenties. I hear it's more noticeable when you develop it as an adult instead of as a child. I'd say you should see an optometrist about it.",

Once again, not something one should do without dr supervision due to the likelyhood of deficiencies occuring, but lately has become a bit of a fad diet along the lines of things like keto.",

Keto is a diet that helps with epilepsy **if you have epilepsy** and fodmap is incredibly useful **if your body can't process certain types of sugars**. But someone who says \"**anyone** can be cured by cutting out processed foods/coffee/bread/etc\" doesn't know a damn thing about medicine. It's especially harmful to encourage using at home cures instead of talking to a doctor and getting a proper diagnosis.\n\nJust my small rant (not directed at you since you also said to talk to a doctor).",

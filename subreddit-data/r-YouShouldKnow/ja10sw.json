            "comment": "Volunteered at a food bank for a bit after I had to use it, can confirm: food banks can get 3-5x as much food per dollar if you donate money instead of food.\n\nIf you already have the food that's ok, but if you were considering buying food just to donate, please do not do that. 2 main reasons:  \n\n1- food is generally packaged in boxes and sent out, and your random purchases can't always fit easily and end up just getting donated to missions or something instead  \n2- your money goes farther than your purchase. You can even get tax credits for your *monetary* donations depending on rules in your jurisdiction. \n\nIf your income is large or you don't have much free time, consider donating money instead of your time. It's what I do now that I work like 10-12 hours a day.",

They get food at very steep discounts for discontinued labels, for food that's close to expiration and needs to be consumed quickly, from distributors making space for other products that are higher in demand, and post-seasonal items that most wholesalers and stores just want to get rid of.",

So it can become an issue providing balanced meals/food to those in need.\n\nIf a grocery store provided 20 cases of chicken noodle soup, the money might be used for crackers to go with that soup  (as an example).",

                            "comment": "I have a question, maybe you can explain then. \n\nWhy do food pantries not toss the moldy/spoiled/old  stuff and still insist on giving it to you?\n\n\n\nI went to the pantry and I don't cook meat, don't eat it hardly ever, and told them I'd like to not take the meat because I would rather let someone who'll actually cook/eat it take it. \n\nThey were really insistent, \"You have to take it, we can't not give it to you\" etc. \n\nSo about 4-6 years ago I had to use the food pantry, and it was the only food pantry I was allowed to go to. I hated it because 90% of what they'd give you needed to be tossed. \n\nA few examples: 4 cantaloupes that were, unbeknownst to me, harboring tiny bugs that apparently hatched during the two days they're were in my fridge (so many!), 24 cartons of heavy whipping cream expiring 3 days before it was given to me, cartons of grapes with white mold all over that they looked like fuzzy marbles, canned goods that were 2-6 years past best by date (I got one from 1999).\n\n I had to keep going because it was the only one that serviced my area, and I figured since they usually gave me so much food that it filled my trunk and half the backseat- the 10% that was usable was better than nothing. (You could only go once a month, so they gave you \"a month's supply of food.\")\n\nThis was the last time I went: \n\nThey always made me take frozen meats even though I tried to turn it down because it'd just be wasted if I took it. So I had to take a whole banana size box (or two) of frozen meats home, which nearly filled my whole freezer. Then I'd spend the next few days trying to find people to take it for free. \n\nI always inspected ALL of the food they would give me. After tossing the moldy shit and spoiled stuff I'd have very little actual usable food. But with the meats, it was a bit trickier, and I had this one package of frozen something wrapped in white paper. I looked ALL OVER for a date, marking, something. \n\nI finally took it and gave it to my father and warned him if he couldn't find a date, just toss it because this pantry is a risky bet 100% of the time. \n\nMy father eats anything. It got burnt beyond recognition? \"I paid for it, I'm eating it.\" Mold in half the loaf? Just tear the moldy half off. Mom fucked up and put salt in instead of sugar? \"Just drink a lot of water to counter the saltiness- it's fine.\" This is a man who once scraped off slimy gunk off old bologna because he didn't want to waste the last slice, said it tasted funny, \"but I ate it anyway since I fried it really good.\" Then was sick with a nasty stomach ache for a few days after. \"But did I die? No.\" This is why I adamantly insisted that he toss the meat if he didn't find a date after unwrapping it. \n\nNext time I see him I asked if he found a date on it or not:\n\nFather:  \"Eh, it wasn't good, just a bit of freezer burn. But I cooked it and it was edible.\" \n\nMe (suspicious): But, you found a date? It wasn't old was it? \n\nFather: Well...\n\nMe (incredulous): You didn't! How old was it? \n\nThe man unwrapped the meat, identified it, decided it was okay to cook- because he found a mom &amp; pop butcher shop logo on it, decided it was okay to eat. He's skirting around the date, telling me about how there's very few butcher places left anymore, etc...\n\nMe: Dad! How old was the meat? \n\nHe sheepishly replies with \"1985.\"\n\nCue me losing my absolute mind and, like... how?! And I just responded to him with \"You ATE meat OLDER THAN your DAUGHTER?!?\"\n\nThat was the last straw and I never went back to that pantry again. But every time I think about this, I get angry about how incredibly stupid and risky the situation was. \n\n\n\nOn the upside, he got lucky and was perfectly fine, and now we give him shit for eating meat older than I am, and he almost never gets sick so I've often wondered if it's possible he boosted his immune system over the decades by eating sketchy foods. And the few times I've caught him about to eat something a bit off, I remind him of the 1985 meat while tossing away whatever it is he's about to eat/cook that's sketchy.",

Part of what they do is offer jobs to formerly homeless vets, people who have been incarcerated for like, decades and such. Of course it\u2019s minimum wage but they employ quite a few people to sort out what can be sold vs. what can\u2019t. They get training in retail. Anything, and I mean ANYTHING, gets baled up and sold as salvage, based on what it is: clothing, shoes, purses, metal, electronics, EVERYTHING. Then that money goes back into the program to help whatever other causes they help out in. In NM, it\u2019s vets (they give rental/housing assistance, help with utilities, and hold classes on basic computer training and how to look for a job). They also have one of the only traumatic brain injury programs in the state, where people have to re-learn basic life skills (and including the computer training and job finding assistance). \n\nObviously please don\u2019t take something that\u2019s been eaten by moths for over a decade, but if it\u2019s something like clothes that no longer fit, furniture, whatever, Goodwill will absolutely turn that \u201ctrash\u201d literally into veterans assistance and job training/ creation. PLEASE DONATE INSTEAD OF THROWING AWAY. \n\nSource: I worked there for a year",

They did pay disabled people half of the minimum wage though. Idk goodwill isnt that great of a company, they're pretty scummy. They liked to remind us lowly employees that our employment was charity lol. You are right about the salvage though, the shoes literally were shipped off to Africa and the clothes were sold for pennies on the pound to a company that would repurpose them for carpet padding. The electronics would be scrapped for the copper including the cords, the books were to be recycled, metal sold for scrap. A large portion of the shit people donated would end up in the trash.",

I understand that NPO/NGOs work with limited funding but, in my area anyways, they want 7+ years or a masters to enter data. Or the entry level stuff is sometimes flooded by retired/semi-retired people that want to do \u201cfeel good work\u201d and bring their decades of experience and minimal pay requirement because they\u2019ve already made enough to retire from their previous career. \n\nI will concede that I could have done more but it\u2019s difficult to find the motivation to do volunteer work while working 50+ hour weeks of all over shift work.",

I got no idea what check box I hit to qualify for that much help but I was so appreciative. \n\nI've come a long way since then, certainly long enough to give back.

It\u2019s not about fitting in by having a lunchables with the Capri-Sun instead of the school burger and fries. It\u2019s about having ANYTHING. Even the petty aspect of having to watch everyone else enjoy themselves and read notes from their parents hurts when you\u2019re sitting for 25 minutes with nothing in front of you, knowing that the cashier was just going to talk down to you if you even tried to charge a meal. \n\nBefore anyone mentions free/reduced lunch, I\u2019d like the people who\u2019s families were \u201ctoo wealthy\u201d to qualify for reduced school lunch even though we couldn\u2019t pay the *bills* at home to stand up. That system has forced thousands of children to go hungry because their parents can\u2019t afford another $400+ a year for school lunch on top of expenses and it\u2019s disgusting. Pray you\u2019re lucky enough to be given the cheese sandwich (no ham, just unmelted government cheese on a roll) instead of being forced to throw your tray in the garbage because \u201cyou owe $20\u201d",

Most pantries already had bags and boxes made up for individuals and then different ones for families. As an individual I will take my bags to say thank you and leave when I got back to my camp I would always get so happy if there was a can of even offbrand ravioli or canned lasagna or even SpaghettiOs just because of the plethora of donated cream corn lima beans green beans beets sweet potatoes. Don\u2019t get me wrong all were eaten but those were just like a little treat to have almost gave you a little bit of a happy dinner   So if you\u2019re donating canned goods don\u2019t be afraid to get the 10 cans for $10 (or even less ) worth of knock off raviolis you might make somebody\u2019s night   and I believe they have enough sweet potatoes at the pantries   thank you from the past me to all those who donate",

(But not that creamed mushy shit though.)\n\nAs an adult, that's used pantries, I'm just more mindful of donating things. I donate newly bought food when my kid's school does these food drives. I include yummy things, like fruit snacks, and cans that have the pulltabs because not everyone has can openers.\n\nAnd PSA: Toilet paper, deodorant, toothpaste, shampoo/ conditioner, pads (esp. the largest size), and tampons are usually direly needed and in short supply because everyone donates foods and not the other stuff.",

In my area there's a \"pay it forward\" group on Facebook for those in need; I list the items on there. None of them are expired, it's all shelf-stable stuff like boxed cereal, granola bars, chicken broth, canned ravioli and soups and chili. I don't buy canned veggies so it isn't a bunch of the same stuff my local food bank offers. \n\nBy going through and donating the older stuff I have stored up, it stops it from becoming a hoarding issue later or me having to throw it away once it gets damaged or expired. I can't really stop myself from buying too much, it's almost compulsive for me. But I do make sure it doesn't get thrown away or wasted.\n\nSomeone always wants it. I get 10-30 people wanting the food. Often almost immediately after posting it. \n\nBut if it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't end up donating food at all. So you're absolutely right. \n\nI live in an area with a large elderly population too, and one very common food bank donation is any food that a deceased loved one had at home. It's convenient for most people; just drop it off and let someone else deal with distribution. Only reason I don't donate mine specifically to the food bank is because I'd have to transport it there and it's a several mile walk. The Facebook group most people are willing to pick it up.",

There is a very very specific list directly from BIAB of what to donate and we do not accept items not on the list.  We have donated hundreds of pounds of food of the exact type they want for the backpacks. So in that sense it works.\n\nBut when I ran a homeless shelter, I had 30 mouths to feed three meals a day.  One regular can of beans would not do squat.  I needed the bulk sizes from Costco or the case lots we got from the government food program for shelters.  I would much rather have gotten a donation check to buy what we needed as opposed to a bunch of random food that I could not put together into a meal for 30.\n\nFor this random stuff, someone else mentioned Blessings Boxes and they are great.  There is one in a church parking lot down the road from me and each month I drop off a couple of boxes of pasta, a couple of jars of sauce, a bag of rice or beans, sometimes cat food in case someone needs to feed their kitty.  I know there are individuals in need who will not go to food pantries and greatly benefit from these.",

I've seen it feed people. With money, cooks can make budgets, and plan meals. I think using \"all of the above\" is probably the right approach.",

He is a skilled purchasing agent or perhaps the volunteer coordinator recruiting and scheduling unpaid staff to keep costs down so more goes to food.  Or the accountant preparing for the audit that is needed to get grants and donations. \n\nWhy should the purchasing director for a food bank get paid less than a comparable position at a similar size grocery?  Or the volunteer coordinator less than a shift supervisor? Or the accountant less just because they work for a non profit?  You are de facto saying the work done not for shareholder/owner value but for public good is inherently less valuable. \n\nJust like when you buy cheap tools they break. If you hire people at a discount you are more likely to get worse results. \n\nI run an NPO and we upped salaries of our front line case managers and raised hiring standards and professional development training . We improved outcomes in employment, wages, college completion, and career advancement. We reduced the time it took for people to get off food and housing assistance by a full year.  So 10k more per year saved 20x that in public cost in a given year. \n\nDon\u2019t ask \u201cwhat do you pay your staff\u201d as the measure of an NPO. Ask...how do you measure success?  If you don\u2019t like the answer to the latter by all means take your money elsewhere.  That is a sign they are not going to use your funds wisely or effectively.",

We also used donated money to buy clothes and shoes from nearby thrift stores to hand out. \n\nIf you do want to donate food, bulk bags of rice and beans are very useful for most food banks. \n\nAnother great item to donate is pet food! At both the soup kitchen and food bank I worked at, we would split up large bags of pet food into smaller portions to hand out. We often had people more concerned with what we had for their pets than what we were offering them to eat.",

About 15 years ago I spoke with the director and he told me that he can't buy turkeys for the price they go for on sale leading up to Thanksgiving. They don't have the staff to have people go out and buy them at the grocery store when they're on sale, and if they call up a distributor they want regular price. So I talked to a few butchers and found a mom and pop place that will order them and sell to me for their cost. I just have to deliver them myself, which I understand a lot of people can't do, but I have a pickup to move them with and a job that is flexible enough I can meet the delivery truck when it shows up at the butcher. \n\nAnyway, if you want to donate, decide what you feel you can give, then call up the food bank and ask them what they need and see if you can solve a problem for them.",

Whenever you want to donate money/ goods to a charity or organization, take 10 minutes to call them and speak to someone about what the organization's needs are, what they're missing, or what projects/ expansions they could use the money for. By taking just a little bit of time you can significantly increase the impact of your donation to them just by finding out what they need.\n\nMy grandfather's story is, he was going to donate a bunch of turkeys to our local food kitchen one year, but decided to call them and see how many turkeys they needed first. They were completely covered up with turkeys and didn't have any more space in the freezers. They were having to turn donations away or send out their own personnel to deliver the turkeys to places they could be used before they went bad, taking time out of their schedules. After calling he found out while they had plenty of turkey, they barely had any sides, so he filled up a huge box with mashed potato mix, gravy packets, stuffing mix, green beans, etc. and delivered that instead, so they could do a proper Thanksgiving dinner at the kitchen",

The food bank I used to work for in Canada has an old ad that states \"your donated $1 buys $5 of food.\" Their current marketing team hate it because it isn't true. In reality your donated $1 allows them to distribute $5 worth of food because of the donated food they receive. Most food banks never have to buy canned goods because of donations, so they only need to buy perishables with the money received. Most likely food banks would only serve a fraction of the public if people only donated money instead of food. This is because they could not aford to purchase all of the food they need to give out.",

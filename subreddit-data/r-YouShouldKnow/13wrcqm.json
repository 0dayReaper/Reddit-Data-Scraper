    "postText": "Why YSK: A projector's specs might say it can handle 1080p input. But if you check the native resolution, you might see that it actually can only handle 480p.\n\nI fell for this scam when I was fresh out of high school and pretty much had no money because I wasn't able to have a summer job (long story). So, that year, I found what I thought was the best-value and asked my grandmother to buy it for me for Christmas. Because I desperately wanted to replace my old Tiger Electronics Zoombox projector and because the way the resolution was written in the specs was kinda confusing, I believed it was a 1080p projector. I thought maybe 800x480 was just like the starting resolution or the one it was most \"confortable\" with or something like that. I believed it until just a couple weeks ago when I looked up the specs for the first time in like ten years and found an article about this issue.\n\nMoral of the Story: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. If a $200 projector boasts a 1080p resolution, check the specs for the native resolution.\n\nTL;DR - Check the native resolution before buying a projector",

If you told be you thought it was 1080p but it was 780i then ok for a projector or on a small screen like a handheld game it would make sense. This is literally the difference between SD and HD though.",

The number to the right of the 'x' is the vertical resolution. That's the number of pixels going from the top of the display to the bottom.\n\nStandard Definition (480p) kinda varies, depending on the time period and the aspect ratio. Originally, it was 640 x 480. Eventually, it moved up to 720 x 480. Then there are widescreen 480p TVs and projectors, which will be more like either 800 x 480 or 854 x 480.\n\nHD can be as low as 720p, which is 1280 x 720. It's HD, but it's not full HD. It's definitely better than 480p.\n\nFull HD (1080p) is 1920 x 1080. Though, if you're checking out monitors, you'll find ultrawide monitors with a resolution of 2560 x 1080. Personally, I think ultrawide monitors are silly except for games like Minecraft. Some games won't even let you use a third of an ultrawide monitor because the company thinks it would give you an unfair advantage.\n\nQHD (1440p) is 2560 x 1440. It's a nice compromise between 1080p and 4K for monitors.\n\n4K (AKA UHD) is kinda complicated, but for TVs and monitors, it's 3840\u2009\u00d7\u20092160.",

            "comment": "First, yes you should always check what the native resolution of a projector is, as well as which formats it officially supports, either through upscaling or downscaling.  \n\nFor the rest, I am not sure what you are trying to say here.  I think you may be confusing the issue a little bit.  It would help to put a link so those really interested in what is going on here can find that info.\n\nIE:  [https://www.projectorcentral.com/maximum\\_resolution.htm](https://www.projectorcentral.com/maximum_resolution.htm)\n\nAlso it sounds a lot like when you were getting that projector back in the day there may still have been CRTs around?  CRTs were better early on at displaying varying resolutions.  I used to have ridiculously high resolutions on my CRT monitor that would not be able to do on an LCD.  That doesn't always mean it would display well at that resolution, especially with video or games, but I mainly used it for actual workspace to have more windows open at once.  This often confused people that moved over to newer formats who were then not able to display some of the content they wanted at the resolution they wanted.\n\nToday, you could buy a projector that has a native resolution of 1080p, but it may be able to upscale to 4k.  Meaning while it can't achieve true 4k, it can still play most 4k sources.  The image will not be as sharp as a native 4k projector, but may still look better than a 1080p.",

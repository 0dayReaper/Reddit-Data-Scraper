    "postText": "Why YSK: pet insurance can ensure that you are able to afford treatment for your pet in cases of emergency or illness.\n\nI figured I would make this post since a lot of people do not even know about pet insurance as an option.  I'm a dog owner (two of them) and one of the hardest things to contemplate is thinking about how much money you are willing or able to spend on your fur baby should they become ill or get severely injured.  You're not a bad person for thinking about that, and in fact, I would say it would be responsible of you to consider that before getting a dog and taking on that responsibility.  I have vet friends and they tell me about instances where their clients forego treatments for their dogs which may save their life due to cost.  I have a friend who's dog got cancer which required 10s of thousands of dollars for treatment.  Luckily he pulled through and my friend could afford it, but many people would not be able to afford the treatment in their shoes, myself included.  I never want to have to decide on whether I can afford to save my dogs life if it came to that.\n\nAs a result, when I adopted my dogs, I obtained pet insurance which basically operates as health insurance for dogs (or other pets).  Over the past ten years or so, pet insurance has gotten a lot more affordable and more options have emerged.  I don't want to recommend any particular company because this is not a commercial (though looking back it kinda reads like one) and policies change but I urge you to look into it if you have a pet or are thinking about getting a pet.  At minimum, it can reduce your stress in knowing that you will never have to decide on whether you can save your animals life due to financial constraints.\n\nEdit:  something I should have mentioned before, if you are getting pet insurance, it is best typically to get it as early as possible while your pet is young (and before the vet finds a bunch of issues).  Most policies (maybe all) do not cover pre-existing conditions.  The top comment discusses it, but I'm a reddit noob and don't know how to pin comments, so I thought I should mention it here.",

            "comment": "YS also K that pet insurance is not required to cover pre existing conditions, so your best bet is to insure your animal as soon as you adopt them. If your animal already has a chronic condition (like epilepsy for example) pet insurance will not cover treatment related to that condition. It also means that if you insure your pet and they develop a chronic condition, you are locked into that insurer because no other company will cover the condition in that pet.",

Literally as soon as she was back up to speed after the first tear/sugery/recovery, the second one went. That year sucked. Shoulda got pet insurance. But really, the months of committed therapy and recovery that fell on me really made life suck for a while.  Way harder than budgeting the money. So it woulda sucked even with insurance, but I could have bought a jet ski or something to reward myself.",

For many policies, these aren't covered. However some policies will cover preexisting conditions on the basis that your pet has been \"clear\" of the condition for an amount of time, usually measured in years. For chronic ongoing conditions, if you can find cover (and it's not impossible) it will probably be expensive, and may cost more than whatever your outgoings for the condition are at the moment, however having certainty over cost may be worthwhile for you. (for example, you currently pay $100 for ongoing treatment and there's a chance your pet will need a $3000 operation. Maybe for you, it's desirable to pay $200 a month for insurance, but not have the risk of needing to pay for the operation.)",

Your idea only works assuming your dog never experiences more than a moderate illness or injury, and that the dog will wait to get hurt until it's old. \n\nBut hey, if you don't love your pet...do you. I would have had to put my girl down if it weren't for the insurance. Bilateral Elbow Dysplasia with degenerative ACL joint disease is no joke. It's more common than you think, and my dog isn't even going to need a second round of surgery on each joint. If she did, we would be talking 60k in a single year.\n\nLearn math.\n\n\n\nEdit: Damn.

I'm very glad for you and your pet that you haven't.\n\n&gt;Insurance isn't some fluffy payment scheme that allows the company to deny any claim they want.\n\nThis is true. But it allows them to *try* to do so. And it allows them to look for any loophole or exception they can in order to deny. And even if they ultimately can't get out of paying, they can certainly fight you about it and try to pay out as little as they can get away with, depending on how long and hard you want to fight. This sort of thing happens all the time, with every type of insurance there is.\n\n&gt;I see it's law and math you're bad at, I'm just sorry your dog has to be the beneficiary of your misguided opinions.\n\nAnd I'm sorry you can't have a discussion without insulting and demeaning a person with whom you have a disagreement. It makes you look defensive and immature, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you're just having a bad day. Glad your dog gets the help they need.",

Insurance companies make money by investing premium money before they payout.\n\nPet insurance only pays out 50-60% back to customers. They make all of their profit from the premiums. Therefore, the customer is losing that 50% expected value over time.\n\n\nYou are much better off, in nearly all real life situations, taking the premium quoted and just putting it into a savings account.",

Of course, I'm only insuring my 1 year old cat with no known health issues, but after my older cat ended up with an unknown mass where his right lung should be, it seemed worth it to me.\n\nHe's still alive and well, being a jerk to his little sister, and Zooming around the house, but I wish I could have gotten a kitty MRI for him, but we couldn't afford it. It wasn't worth it for us to insure him since he already has a known big issue, but I will happily pay the $14-15 a month to make sure we can provide for his little sister, and put aside an emergency vet fund for him. It's nice to only have to worry about major vet bills for one cat instead of two. \n\nTldr: not every pet is insurable, but if you're going to get insurance, get it before anything happens.",

It has gone up from $36/month to $55/month.\n\nNo other health changes, they just jacked the price.\n\nWhen I adopted a cat last year and tried a Figo insurance, it was still around $47/month.\n\nI'm still signed up for both, just wish it was cheaper.",

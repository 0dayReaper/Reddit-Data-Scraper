    "postText": "Why YSK: it can save a life. \n\nI posted this on LPT, but it got removed. Fair enough, I guess this is more of a PSA. \n\nIf you are driving and see something dangerous in the freeway, its a very valid reason to dial 911. \n\nA lot of people think there needs to be massive bleeding or an immense threat to warrant calling 911. But dangerous debris on a freeway *is* a deadly situation. Especially with how bad distracted drivers are these days. \n\nEven just a tire/wheel, for example, can cause a vehicle to flip. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a 6x6 piece of lumber laying across an entire lane. Wasn\u2019t easy to see and can cause a massive accident. Yesterday I saw a ladder laying across an entire lane. From far back it looked like something you could just drive over. But an extension ladder is definitely not something you can drive over. Im sure you\u2019ve all seen crazy things in the road.\n\nCalling it in literally takes about 10-15 seconds:\n\n- \u201cWhat is your emergency\u201d\n- \u201cDebris in the freeway\u201d\n- \u201cWhat is your location\u201d\n- \u201cinterstate X southbound, just before the XX exit.\u201d\n- \u201cwhat is your name and phone number?\u201d\n- \u201c[name] [number]\u201d\n- \u201cthank you\u201d\n- *click*\n\nYou may be the only one to call it in, and it could save someone else from a terrible wreck. It could save a life.\n\nAlso, there is no need to elaborate any of the information. 911 dispatcher\u2019s time is very valuable. Keeping it simple is easier for the dispatcher. No need to diatribe or qualify your call. \u201cIm not sure if this is even an emergency\u201d \u201ci was just driving to blah blah and I saw xyz, I had to swerve, etc etc\u201d \u2026 leave out comments like that. You\u2019re already on the phone. They dont care where you are going, or what your opinions are about the object. Just give then the relevant facts they need to find and address the situation. Being as precise as possible with location and simply saying \u201cthere is a huge [mattress] in lane 3\u201d is all they need to pass the emergency along to appropriate authorities.\n\nEDIT: A few of you have relayed bad experiences when calling 911 for road obstructions. Rude dispatchers who tell them \u201ccall someone else\u201d. But it should be noted the overwhelming amount of people on this thread who report being personally thanked by 911 dispatch for reporting dangerous road obstructions. \n\nIt also should be noted the hundreds of examples below of people who have been in or almost been in terrible accidents from swerving around or hitting objects.\n\nOf course, if there is a bumper or tire on the *shoulder* of a freeway, this is probably not a 911 call. This would be a non-emergency. Its still good to report stuff like this to a non-emergency line so it can be cleared from the shoulder. It likely doesn\u2019t need immediate dispatch though. \n\nA mattress in the center lane of a 5 lane freeway on the other-hand, is a terribly dangerous situation. \n\nThere is always a level of judgement to be executed when calling 911. Of course, their time is valuable.",

They may or may not answer it exactly the same as a designated 911 line, but it's treated with the same level of respect.  Both emergency and non-emergency lines are all just phones hooked to computers, nothing magic about it.\n\nUnless you are somewhere really rural, then who knows what system they might have in place.  Two cans connected by a string, judging by some of the budgets I've seen (lots of people don't realize how hamstringed services are once you get two far from a large enough city - there may be no EMS, and a single 40 year old fire truck, and the closest sheriff deputy is 30 minutes away after you wake him up).  When in doubt to the level of \"emergency,\" just call 911.  The response to the call or the actual scene generally isn't different if you call on non-emergency or 911.

Finally got number for local non-emergency and was dicked round. By the time I finished my calls I was at least 20 minutes passed it and hadn't found anyone willing to do anything. It probably caused an accident that day. With those metal poles, it may have even opened up someones car like a tin can.

But generally I'd agree, if it would benefit to get people there *quickly* (i.e. less than 30 minutes to an hour) then it's worth calling 911.\n\nIf there's nothing the police can immediately do to stop something or if someone will be gone by the time the police get there (which optimistically is going to be at least 7-8 minutes after you start the call with 911 and more likely at least 15-20 min in an urban area for a high priority call).\n\n311 is the non-emergency call relay number, but depending on the city it may not be staffed 24/7, may be for things other than police, or may not exist at all in that city/town. In very rural areas the people who answer 911 calls and other calls are the same, they may only have 1 or 2 dispatchers working for an agency per shift. While major cities typically have unified fully staffed 911 call centers with hundreds of agents. Depending on call volume you may be on hold, do not hang up or you will go to the back of the queue.\n\nSome states have statewide numbers for state police. For instance Florida has \\*347 (\\*FHP) for the Florida Highway Patrol that works anywhere in the state and they can quickly transfer your call to the relevant agency. If you don't know the jurisdiction and have a lower priority call calling the state police or the local county is the best bet.\n\nAlso realize 911 is just a phone number and the dispatcher can't do anything except give you information and dispatch units. Make sure you're in a safe location when you call 911 and don't allow your 911 call to distract you from any safety threats. If you have to put the phone down due to a safety issue do so, but if possible do not hang up. The dispatcher will be working with a Computer Aided Dispatch, talking to units on the radio, and talking to you, so there may be pauses in audio. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just be quiet and let them work.",

Depending where you live, the dispatchers for the emergency 911 line will have different resources available to them and will be able to forward you to the appropriate resources easier. When you call the non-emergency line, you call the specific police station. The specific station may not have access to all these resources and may not be able to assist you in the same capacity. In most places, finding a missing pet would not fall under their responsibilities. You\u2019d be better off calling the local animal control or a pet shelter like the A/SPCA. As a last line resource, you can take them to a vet and they can scan for a microchip/tattoo that\u2019ll hopefully have the owners information.",

But that's probably because I asked to be transferred directly to him.\n\nI got bit by a dog and called non-emergency to ask about procedure.  They said next time call 911 and that they were sending Animal Control out to talk to me and verify the dog's rabies vaccine date.\n\nI used to think \"nobody in danger, nobody hurt, situation stable\" means call non-emergency but in the US it's more of a \"call 911 unless it's noise complaint, blocked bike lane, or information request\" situation.  Obviously that's different in areas where the 911 operators are overloaded but 911 is very much a \"I need assistance in a timely manner\" resource compared to the non-emergency numbers.",

Likely because in the US, they're legally liable for their fuck ups (and there's no \"common sense\" clause to protect them).",

Dispatcher spent the next 5 minutes telling me that [X West] isn\u2019t a real thing and neither was the Exit number. \n\nLack of training/panic from the dispatcher is what I think occurred, because they added me to the call with a fire dispatcher and they understood the directions perfectly fine.",

The Bomb Squad will then usually call the nearest Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad from the Navy, Air Force,  or Army, which will usually get the robot out and put some C-4 to detonate the land mine in place. This whole process will take optimistically several hours and possibly up to an entire work day.\n\nIf for some reason it's in a place where the robot can't reach, then they will send a guy in a bomb suit to place the explosives. It is possible to clear the mines with vehicles, but this is not really used unless it's a minefield and not a single mine. It's also possible as a last resort to clear it with a metal detector, plastic probe (stick), and a shovel if for some reason it can't be detonated in place but this is an extremely dangerous job for obvious reasons even with a suit and not preferred.\n\nAlso not that it's super common but always treat ordinance as if it's live and do not disturb it. It's far more likely you'll find mines traveling abroad in former conflict areas like the Falkland Islands, but if you ever do stop immediately and very slowly walk out on the path which you came in on. Be very careful not to disturb any tripwires or other triggers. If you can get down your stomach, get a long stick, and poke the ground at an angle looking for metal objects. Methodically go left to right probing every 1-2 inches clearing the minimum needed to get a path out. Mines are almost always laid as part of a minefield in a regular pattern and a mine will almost always have friends nearby.\n\nI remember there was a case in 2008 where some history buff decided to restore (aka take a grinder to get the rust off of) [a cannonball from the American Civil War](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/140-yr-old-cannonball-kills-civil-war-fan/) which he believed was inert. The thing exploded on him and he was killed.\n\nEOD members in France and Belgium are still getting killed clearing Unexploded Ordnance fired [all the way back in World War 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ww1-century-bombs/a-century-on-from-ww1-100-years-of-work-remains-to-clear-munitions-idUSKCN1N40TS).

I tried calling the non-emergency line a year or so ago to report something in the middle of a highway and it took me multiple minutes and navigating through phone menus in order to try and reach someone. There wasn't even a clear option to report something in the road so I ended up giving up after what felt like forever but was probably only like 7 minutes haha.\n\nNever called the non-emergency line before so I have NO idea if it's nornal for it to be an automated system like that or not, or if I even had the correct number tbh, but it was not easy. Thanks for this, OP!",

You have emergency calls for things like car crashes, heart attack victims, house fires, etc. And then you also have non-emergency calls for things that aren't going to require police, fire, or EMT's racing to the scene with their lights on and sirens blaring.\n\nI once had to call 911 at work to report a fake $100 bill that came through so that we could get a police report filed for the forgery. The first thing I did was say \"my name is SmokeGSU and this is a non-emergency call.\" I then explained what happened and requested a police officer to come and collect the bill to file a report and take my statement.",

I called 911 right away and the operator was just as concerned as I was. I don\u2019t know what happened to this day but there were so many people wanting to help and that was good but I don\u2019t know if any of the people stopped thought to call 911.

Sometimes law enforcement needs to call back to witnesses. In anything that involves a wrongful death, they exhaust all avenues possible. For example, I reported seeing a ladder on the freeway. It wasn\u2019t worth wasting time to ask if I had seen it fall off a truck. But imagine a scenario where that ladder causes a deadly accident. They would probably reach back out to me and ask more questions. \u201cDid you see it fall? Did you see any contractor trucks ahead of you? Do you have a dash cam?\u201d\n\nInstead of making the dispatcher have to decide when it is and isn\u2019t appropriate to ask for contact info, they just make it protocol to always ask. Then it can never come down to a wrong judgement call.",

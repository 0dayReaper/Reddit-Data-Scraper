    "postText": "Why YSK: I witnessed a nasty accident while waiting at a light, and it could have been prevented. A woman in a sedan was waiting to turn left in a 4-way intersection and she had her wheels pointed left. While she was waiting for opposite-direction traffic to clear, she was bumped from behind by an inattentive teenager and her car was pushed into the path of oncoming traffic. Her car got hammered, but thankfully she was OK. If her wheels were pointed straight ahead, her car would have been pushed harmlessly into the traffic box instead. This simple thing could save your life!",

Stopping time is affected by speed. The greater the speed, the greater the stopping time. It is fine to argue the point online, but in reality, you are asking someone to increase their risk of very serious bodily injury just to try and manage an already unhinged individual's emotions. Slowing down is the sane, safe thing to do when people follow too close because it is no longer optimal driving conditions. In fact, I'd argue, having someone following too close guarantees a collision if a car pulls out or a tire blows, etc... Forcing someone to drive the speed limit in such a dangerous situation is mind-blowingly irresponsible. Who cares if that driver is pissed off. I'd rather not risk my life to baby a person who who is risking my life over a couple minutes.",

If your foot is on the break, the amount that you go forward will be less, but you will still go forward. How much you go forward also depends on the speed and size of the vehicle that hit you. I'm any case, your car WILL move forward some amount. \n\nIf you don't turn your wheel the car will go directly forward. Into a space that is very unlikely to be occupied by any other objects - vehicles, pedestrians, etc. are not likely to be directly on front of you when you're about to turn left. \n\nIf your wheel is turned to the left you're going to go forward and to the left, putting you directly into a lane with oncoming traffic, putting yourself (and other drivers) at risk of a head on collision.\n\nIf you still don't understand after this explanation, you probably shouldn't be driving.",

It's that simple. \n\nYou have no reason to turn your wheel to the left while sitting at a red light, because you should be gong forward slightly, after that stopping point, before you start your left turn. If you DO turn your wheel early (while sitting at the red light) for some unknown reason, and then get hit from behind, your car is still going to go forward AND slightly left. Now it's likely going to still be in the way of crossing traffic, but also now potentiality be partially in the incoming lane as well as partially in the lane you started in. Which will block even more traffic and put yourself and your car in an even more dangerous situation.\n\nBottom line: when making a left turn, don't turn the wheel until you actually start the turn.",

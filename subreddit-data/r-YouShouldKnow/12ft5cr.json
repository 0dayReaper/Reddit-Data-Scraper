Lactose I think is a sugar, casein might be a protein, and I believe the third is milk fat. Any one of these can give you a problem. Cheese can be lactose free, but still contain casein. If casein is what you\u2019re intolerant to then you\u2019re still going to have tummy trouble from eating cheese.",

Then an additional pill should be taken 45 minutes after eating.  I\u2019ll be trying this.",

Almond farming is grossly unsustainable and is causing irreversible damage to California's central valley where 80% of the world's supply of almonds are grown. Almonds are an extremely water intensive crop, and farmers pump groundwater to support their orchards, leading to subsidence that irreversibly shrinks aquifer capacity. The farmers do not pay for the damage their practices cause and the price of almond milk does not reflect the true cost of its production. Almonds are a nutritious and delicious snack, but drinking almond milk is just gluttony. Oat and Soy are far more sustainable options.",

But I once got so wrapped around the axle with consumer guilt about every little thing I found shopping for my family's food to be nearly impossible. No plastic, no bottled water, no chocolate, no sugar, no palm kernel oil, free range chicken and eggs, humanely sourced butter and cheese and fish, fair trade coffee, etc. And then to add the restrictions of a low FODMAP diet to that list became paralyzing. \n  It's the food industries that must change, and the government that must make laws to compel that change.",

It\u2019s some days you can handle the amount, some days you can\u2019t. It changes as you age, as well, and not always in a negative fashion. Sickness can also change how your body accepts it. For me, it took weeks of bad digestion/bathroom visits and finding direct correlation to dairy and cheese to discover I couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nI often wonder how many people just crap their brains out all the time and never put together that they just can\u2019t eat dairy. It\u2019s kind of hard to fathom not having dairy in my area, it\u2019s just in or with everything. It\u2019s sort of like being vegan and trying to dodge certain additives and ingredients.\n\nI also wonder if there are more people because of long CoVID effects.\n\nBasically, people\u2026pay attention to your body, it tells you when things aren\u2019t right.

Do not assume people avoiding dairy are simply lactose intolerant. \n\nNon-dairy coffee creamer, for example, is a milk derivative containing casein. Whey sneaks into a lot of things, too.\n\nWhen making a meal dairy free, remember to consider breads, buns, and other ingredients.\n\nRecognize that many people, including servers, do not know what exactly counts as dairy, and may not consider what's in breads, if buns are buttered, what is a sauce.

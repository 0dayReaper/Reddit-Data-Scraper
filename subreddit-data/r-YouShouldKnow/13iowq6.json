    "postText": "Why YSK: Whenever the subject of banks is brought up in conversation, a few people immediately dive into why Credit Unions are superior. This includes better rates, high value services you can use, and more. \n\nOne that's not brought up ever is \"Shared Branching.\" Many credit unions are a member of a cooperative that allows you to do many banking functions (not all) at a branch of a participating credit union. \n\nThis is one of the reasons why people like huge banks - broad accessibility. \n\nIf your credit union belongs to a cooperative of shared branching banks, you can go to ANY one of them to get things like:\n\n- Fee-free ATM\n- Depositing and withdrawing from your account\n- Make payments on a loan\n- Buy a cashier's check\n- Get account/statement information\n\nThis gives you access not only nationally, but also to certain international branches. Many cite the reason they avoid smaller banks is a lack of access due to travel - there's no need if your credit union is a part of a shared branching Co-op.",

It's a great way to have access to services without having to go to your home branch. And the fact that it extends not just nationally, but also to international branches is a huge plus. It's definitely something that more people should be aware of when comparing banks and credit unions.",

            "comment": "Not all branches will participate in share branch transactions. The credit union might participate but may only allow other banks transactions at certain locations. They will generally not advertise this on their website but will have a sign when you go into the branch.  \n\nAlso share branch transactions are limited in amount and quantity. This can be a big pain if you're traveling.  I was once on vacation while waiting to hear back from a new apartment application, ended up not getting the apartment because I couldn't share branch the transfer for the deposit because it was more than $500.  \n\nCredit unions can be useful but if you travel regularly at all you're better off with a retail bank.",

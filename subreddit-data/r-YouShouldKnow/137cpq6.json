    "postText": "Why ysk, a lot of people don't realize it, but at every public railroad crossing, there is a big metal box somewhere. On that box will have a phone number and a location number. If ANYTHING happens, call that number, it will bring you to dispatch who can shut down that area and warn oncoming trains. \n\nI have seen it happen too many times  where people don't think to call while their car gets stuck on the crossing, and a train comes by a few minutes later and destroys it.\n\nEven if you see a crossing arm not working,  or vandalism, or anything. Call that number so it can be documented and promptly fixed\n\nEdit: this is for the US, but I don't know if other countries do something similar",

Every rail/highway crossing in the US at least has one and it uniquely identifies that particular location anywhere.  It doesn\u2019t do me that much good to say \u201cMain Street \u201c when there were like 50 of them in every little town in my job,  but \u201cnumber 123456A\u201d tells me exactly where and could save valuable time in getting train traffic stopped.\n\nAnother commenter asked why use the 800 number instead of 911:  the answer is that 800 number will be dispatched directly to the field maintenance forces in that location and had a faster response.  911 has to go through a few more steps to achieve the same end.  \n\nFederal regulations say the signs all have to look the same they look like this : https://railroads.dot.gov/railroad-safety/divisions/highway-rail-crossing-and-trespasser-programs/emergency-notification\n\nDepending on what you tell the dispatcher if/when you call will determine what the trains do because of the malfunction/accident.  A crossing tripped with no trains will make a slow order.  One reported to be not functioning at all will require the crew to stop, get out and stop traffic then go on.  A disabled vehicle or accident, or emergency response activity on the crossing will result in traffic being held.\n\nRemember the rail workers in charge of the crossings you use live in the same communities you do, and nobody wants to see tragedy.\n\nLastly,  I have to say I don\u2019t represent any current or former employer of mine.  Just me wanting to do right.",

But locals were accustomed to a large delay between the barriers *and* a very long slow train. I used to cross those tracks on my daily commute and saw people drive around the barriers or pedestrians duck under regularly. Or people would turn around and take a different route *around* the train. For an especially heavy train, you could be waiting ten minutes for it to pass.",

No need to get out of your car unless it is literally on the tracks. Why would I be arguing otherwise?",

It's almost like if you can get far enough away, you'll be safe. Also, a crumple zone won't stop scrap metal from flying through your windshield, itll crumple if something wide woth a lot of spread out force hits the car, if it's too thin it'll puncture through, that's how force works, they aren't to stop the car from being damaged they are to slow the extreme change in velocity occurring from a collision, any debris abive the windshield is killing you if launched at the right angle. If you are talking about debris here, you absolutely aren't any safer in your car than behind the nearest solid wall. Sidenote, what's the danger in being stalled NEAR a train track, why would you be calling the trains service if you and nobody else is blocking the tracks, seems like you'd have no point in calling in the first place unless you are actively in a spot that's too dangerous, and again, if you wanna stay in your car at that point you can take those chances, but they aren't good chances.",

Never suggested anything otherwise in any of my comments.\n\n&gt; Also, a crumple zone won't stop scrap metal from flying through your windshield\n\nCorrect, but your flesh is a lot worse at blocking scrap metal.\n\n&gt;  If you are talking about debris here, you absolutely aren't any safer in your car than behind the nearest solid wall.\n\nDo you have enough time to gauge whether you'll be putting yourself in harm's way by getting out of your car and running to a wall? \n\n&gt;why would you be calling the trains service if you and nobody else is blocking the tracks\n\nProbably the worst straw man I've read all week. I'm saying the situation is that someone is stuck on the tracks and you're a car or two behind them.\n\n&gt; you'd have no point in calling in the first place unless you are actively in a spot that's too dangerous\n\nEver heard of the bystander effect?... This is just outright bad, dangerous advice.\n\n&gt;  if you wanna stay in your car at that point you can take those chances, but they aren't good chances.\n\nIf a train is coming, the situation has basically already played out. I'll take my chances inside a vehicle that has been built upon decades of safety engineering standards rather than trying to jump out of the car and find a wall to hide behind. Stupid, bad, dangerous advice coming from you all. Hope nobody ever follows it.",

That's why I made that \"straw man\" because it literally doesn't make any sense whatsoever that you would be near the tracks in a working car and not just hid the reverse, you are brain rotted at best for that take. If you have enough time to call, you have enough time to gtfo, so if you are even asking yourself what you should do, getting away is ALWAYS the answer, so yes, I'd go to a solid wall immediately or if I got into your dumb ass problem I'd hit reverse and grt my car behind a wall, then call. So let's recap, shall we. Your BIG HUGE PROBLEM,  is that you see someone stalled, you are behind then in a working car, and you are too stupid to hit the reverse, instead you decide you can't be bothered to check for trains, you can't be bothered to look st the sign giving you the number, you'd rather call 911 and say \"I'm sitting behind this guy stalled on the train tracks in my working car, I'm gonna sit tight until you guys get here to....main street, OK bye\". And then just sit tight and wait to see what happens?",

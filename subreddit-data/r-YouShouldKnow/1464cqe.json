    "postText": "Why YSK: ERs are there to quickly and efficiently find emergencies and treat them. If no emergency is found then their job is done. It is the patients' job to follow-up with their primary care or specialist for a more in depth workup should their symptoms warrant that.\r  \n\r  \nI'll give a quick example. A patient presents to the ER for abdominal pain for 3 months. They get basic labs drawn and receive an abdominal CT scan and all that's found in the report is \"moderate retained stool\" and \"no evidence for obstruction or appendicitis\". The patient will be discharged. Even if the patient follows their instructions to start Miralax and drink more fluids and this does not help their pain, the ER did not fail that patient. Again the patient must adequately follow up with their doctor. At these subsequent, outpatient appointments their providers may order additional bloodwork tests not performed in the ER to hone in on a more specific diagnosis.",

Just because someone calls 911 doesn\u2019t mean you need to go or even allow EMTs to assess you. \n\nBut people who are having a genuine medical emergency first time seizure shouldn\u2019t have care delayed just because someone waited the length of the seizure (plus post ictal time) to get an answer on whether the person has had a seizure before. And someday if god forbid you happen to have status epilepticus you might be glad the ambulance isn\u2019t delayed by an additional 5 minutes which is 5 more minutes your brain is frying.",

I took care of her for 2 months after her surgery, making myself sick in the process because there were no facilities that could help other than the one that handed me drugs and wiped her ass 1 time in the day vs me having to give her her final dose of morphine after watching her spasming to death.  \n\nYeah.  The average person does look at the hospital and nurses and doctors like they're the answer because that's the mental training we've been given our entire lives.  It made us feel really protected until we actually needed it.  \n\nClinics don't actively try to fix you either.  They pad the bill, trying to keep you coming.  Specialists do tests, but they spread everything out so long that it saps every bit of hope you have of being fixed.  The ER tends to cost more than both of those and does jack shit and treats you like a dumb piece of shit for using it and then talks bad about you when you aren't in the room lol.  \n\nIt's more likely that every person involved in the medical industry will test you for everything but what you need, charge you nonstop at double or triple the price of the actual value to kill your insurance coverage, and then leave you broken in their wake because your issue wasn't the cut and copy easy answer on google.",

One time I was taking an Uber to work, and a little bit after getting in I noticed a fat stack of cash sitting on the floor. I'm an honest person, so I told the driver straight away that someone must have forgotten it. He said something about how his last passenger was drunk coming back from the casino, and it must have been his. I laughed about it, we finished the ride, and I went to work.\n\nMonths and months later, I take an Uber to work again. Small talk with the driver eventually leads him to tell his crazy anecdote of a passenger finding a bunch of cash and getting their feathers all ruffled about it. Getting upset at a big mess in the back seat, probably wishing they kept quiet once they realized how much money the \"mess\" really was. It was me. I was that passenger, and I definitely was not upset when I found the money. Concerned, maybe, but not upset.\n\nIt was an interesting look at how peoples' ideas of events can either be wrong from the start, or maybe change to be wrong over time. In the end I didn't mention that he was telling me my own story wrong, I just laughed and went on with my day.",

But again, the energy for change needs to be focused on systemic advocacy for improved access, hiring, establishing and maintaining rural GPs. In the meantime, we must try and book our long wait list GPs as soon as possible and try to avoid using the ER as a \"solution\". It just makes the already large problems with ER wait times worse.",

If someone NEEDS care quick, that's what the ER is for. But what you think you need and what you actually need are very often not the same. \"I've had this for 3 weeks and I can't see my doctor for 3 more\" is not a need. \n\nNow, if you aren't sure that you need help immediately or not, totally reasonable to go to the ER. But if they determine you don't need immediate help, you have to understand the system isn't built for them to act as your primary doctor.",

Limited public transport plus long waits for a PCP appointment mean more ER visits. The only urgent care left here on the main hospital system is in the next town over from the ER. That's a huge problem for people without a car or the money for an uber, which affects many people on medicaid or Medicare. The very poor, disabled and elderly are often unable to drive. Hospitals tend to be on the bus line but the stand alone clinics are often not. Make urgent care clinics and same day appointments more accessible and less people will use the ER.",

Regular doctor said leave right now and go to the ER (which we did, again). \n\nGlad we did though, because SO ended up being in the ER two days before being admitted to the actual hospital",

I'm not talking about your friendly neighborhood small businesses or pop up shops using Square or whatever. \n\nNo.\n\nWell established lawyer and accounting offices charging at least 3.5% on top of everything else you are already (probably) expecting to pay. \n\nWhat makes it even more sketchy is that this fee policy is not something made abundantly clear when you sign up with these groups. They'll talk about their hourly rates and such but you won't know anything about their card processing recoup fee until you try to pay over the phone and they tell you or you pop by in person and an understated sign by the card reader barely catches your eye mere seconds before you swipe your card. They almost had you! \n\n\nTL; DR: Check fraud is up, by my guess, because B&amp;M stores are trying to recoup their card processing fees by passing them directly to customers who use debit and credit cards at the point of sale. Some customers who have noticed this change and wish to avoid a ~3.5% surcharge have switched to paying with checks at these establishments.\n\nMore checks in circulation = more opportunities for check fraud.",

When you're dealing with purchase orders, everything needs to be on the invoice, and if it isn't, we got to call around and get approvals, making vendor payments slower, especially if receivables is difficult to reach or constantly cycling employees. Currently, my company doesn't pay these unless it's very urgent, which requires a whole other process to approve, so 9 times out of 10, I'd wind up having to convince the vendor's AR to void the invoice and send it back minus the cc fee so we could mail them a check. \n\nBefore i went over to accounting, our postman was robbed at gunpoint, and the police were pretty sure the perps had been watching him from afar for weeks to familiarize themselves with his routes. They took a box of nearly 1000 checks, washed them, and everyone had to bust ass for weeks to reconcile the payments. The whole department was behind for months.  My company ate all the stop pay fees, some of the late fees, and jobs got delayed due to non payment. It was a clusterfuck.  I still get notifications whenever someone tries to cash one of the checks, and I left that position to go to IT months ago.",

Also most fraudsters would recommend these things knowing people will do this.  I worked in the banking industry for Ober 16 years and this was a red flag statement from the feds \n\nSo in the end using checks to pay was supposed to be filtered out but was pushed back due to the lax in regulation which also rolled back some of the punishment if Rico is involved.  \n\nSo to sum it up, don't pay by check unless there is no choice.  Use a bill pay or any other form of payment.  Also always and I mean always don't let mail stay in your box, cause fraudsters also look out for any piece of mail they can seize any of your information.  This is how accounts are opened and such",

Woke up to an email that said \"You have 0 dollars in your account\" then another that said draft protection kicked in. \n\nOpened with fraud right away which took them 10 days to get back to me and give me my money back (assuming they saw it was the first time my account was drained). Instantly swapped banks to a credit union since i had to force close the accounts anyway. If you transfer whoever has your info will steal the transfer.\n\nAlso if the bank doesn't give you your money back you can escalate to CFPB to get it back easier. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/q9135e/help_someone_spent_3500_on_my_wells_fargo_account/",

Somebody is paying for it, and that somebody is almost always you at the end of the day.\n\nThe provider of my property management software has recently put everyone on blast that free ACH payments are going away.  Their costs are rising, and rather than jack up the price per unit to their direct clients (me), they're going to start charging tenants the $2 fee for taking e-payments. \n\nI hate this, obviously, because now our tenants have no truly free payment options.  Still, it's much less of a pain in the ass for me to take thousands of payments every month electronically than it is to process checks in the mail.  But up until now, the SaaS provider was footing the bill.  The price went up and they're no longer willing to pay it at the current rates.\n\nSo either I pay it, or the tenants do.  But if I pay it, at the end of the day that cost is going to be calculated into the next rent increase, so they'll still end up paying it.\n\nThe consumer always foots the bill in the end.",

Checks are usually cut weekly and come in the Thursday the following week. I waited till the Monday after that before giving them a call that I hadn't received my check. They said the check had been cashed already, and sent me a copy of the endorsement which was my my name and somebody else's printed on the back of the check with 3rd grade handwriting. \n\nSomeone literally just got a hold of the check, took it to some hoodrat check cashing spot and made off with the money. Luckily the company ate the cost and sent me an electronic transfer while the fraud investigation took place. \n\nBetween Zelle and ACH and Venmo for small stuff there is really no reason to send any form of money through the mail.",

I woke up with my account being overdraft, had to pay $25 to urgent wire that amount from another account, as I didn\u2019t know what was that about.\n\nThe bank reached out to me and never paid the check. Luckily, I was refunded the 2.5k but had to eat a few $25 wire transfer fees to cover a bunch of payments that were returned as that account was permanently frozen. Had to get a brand new one. In summary, it costed me 100 dollars plus a few hours changing my registered account in dozens of systems.\n\nI asked the bank teller: \u201cthe bank has a name (written on the check), a destination account, app information from whoever tried to mobile deposit it. Are you doing anything with it\u201d? She said \u201cno, we don\u2019t pursue it further\u201d.\n\nSo in case you\u2019re looking for a ILPT: check fraud seems to be pretty safe for whoever is doing it, so suit yourself. /s",

I used to get Aus dollars as presents from family but it got to the point the exchange rate was so bad it wasn't worth changing the money.  I kept the last lot I got so I now have some 25(ish) year old Aussie dollars in pristine condition worth about \u00a36 if I exchanged them.  They're in my accidental currency collection (for some reason everyone in my family decided I collect coins so I got given loads from all over the place.  Kept them because, while they're worth nothing, they are pretty cool)\n\nPointless story there, sorry lol",

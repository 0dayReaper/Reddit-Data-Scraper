    "postText": "If you're doing your own research and need credible sources for a paper or project, you should not have to pay journal publishers money for access to academic papers, especially those that are funded with government money. I'm not a scientist or researcher, but the info in the title came directly from a Ph.D. at Laval University in Canada. She went on to say that a lot of academic science is publicly funded through governmental funding agencies. It's work done for the public good, funded by the public, so members of the public should have access to research papers. She also provided a helpful [link](http://holly.witteman.ca/index.php/2017/12/11/getting-access-to-paywalled-papers/) with more information on how to access paywalled papers. ",

My institution had to pay fucking 29 USD/48 hours for an article 160 years old.\n\nOne hundred and sixty years old. Fuck Elsevier and Wiley.\n\nThere should be a Noble prize for Sci Hub.\n\nEdit: the downloaded article can be used indefinitely as long as it is not distributed to others. I was unable to know what was in the article prior to downloading it, which is a common problem. I found the article through another article from early 20th century referencing it for some reason. I downloaded it via SciHub which has nearly all chemistry journals. ",

A decent journal can take a long time to peer review and publish research, and that is time (sometimes a year!) where other researchers are not exposed to some cutting edge research or idea. By having pre-prints avaiable (that have not been peer-reviewed mind you) I can be inplementing new research as quickly as it is discovered, and in such a rapidly accelerating field this is critical. Much of my personal research is based on such papers. It is just key to have a personal method of filtering out bullshit.  I follow eminent authors with a high publishing standard usually,  or papers that come out of a highly regarded research group like google research etc. It's not a perfect system, but I can't think of a better one.",

In journal terms a predatory one is a journal which will take money from the author for publishing in open access form but which neglects the crucial parts of the scientific publishing process: double-blind peer review, possibility to reject, and asking for author corrections before publication. An example would be a shady sounding journal named something like \u201cThe East Baltimore Journal of Cardiac and Renal Surgery\u201d which charges 700\u20ac to publish a paper without even passing it by experts. So essentially publishing anything as long as you pay. \n\nElsevier on the other hand is predatory towards university funding and putting anything they can behind a paywall, so towards the end reader.

This is to pay the editors and staff that do all the work of coordinating peer review, maintaining websites, sending people to conferences, administrative work, editorial work, print publishing and lots of other stuff.

Scientists do all the hard work and research of conceiving of and executing the work and writing the results up as a manuscript without any financial support from journals (funded by the government or sometimes private corporations)\n2. They submit their manuscript to the journal for peer review.  Their peer scientists spend considerable time carefully technically reviewing the manuscript for the journal, for free (as a service to the community), without any financial support from the journals\n3. If accepted, scientists then often *pay the journal* (sometimes \\~$1k or more) to publish their manuscript\n4. Anyone else who then wants to read the manuscript pays the journal for access\n\nSo to summarize: Journals charge scientists to have scientists give them the product the journal sells (papers), and then get other scientists to carefully check those papers for free, and then sell the papers to other people.  I kid you not.  Imagine if you made a living by selling products that other people paid you to be able to make for you.",

            "comment": "There's a level of detail that is missing here.  I used to work, briefly, in this industry, so here is a view of where the money goes in academic publications.\n\nFirstly, there are two models for publication - subscription, and open access.  They mostly concern how the material is distributed *after* publication but they also affect how it is published.\n\nSubscription-based are the older model.  In this, papers are published in the journal, and the journal is paid for by consumers on a subscription basis (and only available to subscribers).  For example, The Lancet is a weekly publication since 1823.  In this model, there is no cost to the author for the publication process (which includes editing, multiple rounds of peer review, often feedback and re-editing by the author), this is absorbed by the publishing house, who recoup their money through the subscriptions.  The papers are often very prestigious and picky about their content, so they justify their high price by supposedly having the most exclusive and best quality content.  Being published in the Lancet is still a sign of prestige, for example.\n\nUnder the Open Access model, the author pays for the publication process.  Or rather, when setting up their bid to fund their paper, they will typically include a cost for the publication, so it is paid by whoever is sponsoring the paper.  When the article is published, it is made completely open and distributable for free.  Entities that want to foster research in an area, or do not have an interest in monetising the research, such as governments paying for research, favour this model as it brings the largest benefit to everyone who wants to read the research.  So almost all government-funded research is free by design under this publication model.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in my experience those who contribute to the reviewing, editing etc often get paid nothing for this, they may be research students etc, but I do not have full visibility on this.\n\nNaturally the Open Access model is terrifying the big academic publishers (Reed Elsevier etc) because the subscription model nets them a large amount of money and on a continuous basis.  In my experience no authors get monetary compensation for being published in such subscription journals, it is just the prestige of being seen as top of their field.\n\nPapers published under open access should be easily distributable by the author (or indeed available online anywhere).  Papers published under subscription are usually *technically* prohibited to be distributed outside that method.",

The nonsense level of justification for why is making, indexing and hosting a 15 page pdf costing them 1800$ per paper is just beyond me.\n\nAlso you did not mention the concept of Green vs Gold open access. Green is like saying \u201coh I get ALL the closed paper rights to your paper and you cant post it anywhere for the next 3 years. After that when your paper is becoming \u201cold\u201d in terms of academia, then you can have it open access\u201d.\n\nThis system is rotten to the core ",

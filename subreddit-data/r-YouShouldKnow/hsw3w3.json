I know individuals who regularly transport $15k machine parts in their personal vehicles and they need to take turns slow. Too often, I get mad at someone for not being aggressive and taking that turn or accelerating slower than I do. I forget that not everyone has an empty vehicle like mine.",

'They can wait'.\n\nI have a theory that some people camp in the left lane because it's less 'scary'.  One side is protected by a barrier and you only have one lane of cars moving beside you.   Plus you dont have to deal with merging from people entering the highway.  \n\nI personally feel safer on highways.  More predictable and less moving parts going in different directions.",

Id bet many of the people laughing at you dont use their turn indicators, or forget to turn them off for 3 intersections, cause who cares... i caught one of the guys working with me at the time delivering food, always cheeky fuckin bastard, telling everyone how they drive like grandpas, and he never had an accident... until i was leaving with a delivery, and he was comming back from one. He was cuting the corner, without turn indicator, and almost crushed into me, i hit the breaks last second and he managed to squize thru, i just got out of the car, and looked at him. He never said another word about driving whatsoever, neither did he mention about our near miss. We both had mandatory cams, so he knew i could get him fired for that alone. Im not sure not doing that was the right choice, but at least i saw him using the bloody turn indicator recently, so maybe he learned. Many people dont.",

She was doing the speed limit in the passing lane and wasn\u2019t passing anyone. So I moved into the right lane to go around her. She accelerated with me to more than 15 over the limit so I couldn\u2019t pass her and then when I was forced to move back behind her she decelerated back to the speed limit. Then she got pissed at me when I rode her ass instead of trying to get around her again (not my best moment), after 3 cards passed the two of us she finally moved over and then flipped ME off while screaming. \n\nLike seriously?\n\nAnyway, my roommate ended up fine, but it was one stressful day let me tell you.",

Many cars don't have cruise control, but you should at least be able to keep up speed over long distances.\n\nIt's one thing to vary by 5mph over a bit of distance, because then people behind can just fall back a bit and set CC and let it ride. But some folks will just gun it and then let their speed fall as they coast and drop like 15mph slower before stomping the pedal again.\n\nThen if you're behind them you're constantly turning cruise control on and off and setting and resetting it trying to figure out what speed the moron in front of you is trying to go.\n\nAnd they always manage to find that gas pedal when you're trying to pass them! Asshole you were topping out at 55 for the last 10 miles now all of a sudden I'm trying to pass and you're keeping pace with me at 70? I always put my turn signal on and then merge back into the right lane right in front of them like \"oops didn't notice you trying to angle me out and prevent me from passing soooooorryyyyyyy\"\n\nMaybe they'll learn?",

Slow doesn't make you good. It usually means you lack the basic confidence to drive and should get the fuck off the road. \n\nAnd likewise, fast doesn't make you a skilled driver, it makes you a dangerous idiot and you should also get the fuck off the road. \n\nThe real problem is that like 75% of people who have licenses simply don't deserve them, and they should be insanely hard to get.

I'm not sure where you are, but in the US that problem is in this endless loop because there are often no viable alternatives (outside from a few major areas) so not giving someone a drivers license is akin to holding them back from being a member of society at all.",

If a significant enough amount of Reddit users live in major cities with mega highways, it kind of makes sense that the Reddit opinion would skew towards fast driving.  Like I live in DC, and driving the speed limit (55mph) on the 5 and 6-lane portions of 495 will get you run over even in the right lane",

The highways are undivided 2 lane roads with non-existent shoulders in many areas and ice can be a hazard for like 8 months of the year. Too many elk and deer around to justify speeding, anyways.\n\nThen summer hits, and the Texans show up. Suddenly traffic speed is 15mph higher with people doing questionable passing all over the place and you can't really use crosswalks even in town due to people going 45+ in the middle of town. I always assumed it was people coming from those kinds of roads pulling that shit not realizing how different stuff gets out in the country.",

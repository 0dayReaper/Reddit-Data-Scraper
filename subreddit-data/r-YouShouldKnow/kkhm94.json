    "postText": "This is prompted by the comments on a r/Facepalm post with lots of people saying if someone hasn\u2019t checked up on you this year they\u2019re a shitty friend, there\u2019s no excuse etc.\n\nWhy YSK: Over the years I\u2019ve known friends and family withdraw from the world for months on end because of depression or other illnesses. They often carry a lot of guilt about this and it becomes a self perpetuating issue because they\u2019re afraid of the response they\u2019ll get when they eventually do make contact again. You often won\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with them, they\u2019ll just drop off the radar. But these people will need your friendship and support more than ever when they begin to engage with the world again. So if someone goes quiet don\u2019t write them off as a \u2018shitty friend\u2019. Be open minded about their reasons, give them space, time and understanding, and be ready to pick up the threads again when they\u2019re ready.\n\n(Citation needed for sub rules about health flair? Here\u2019s an [NHS document](https://www.cpft.nhs.uk/download.cfm?ver=1738) that describes withdrawal from social activity as symptom of depression)",

I can resonate with that being a great decision, and I did the same thing! Currently trying to recover from depression and lost contact with most friends as a result over the past several years. But yesterday I reached out to several friends for the first time in ages, and it went well for the most part.\n\nStill have other reconnections to make with my older more closer friends, that will involve more than just a simple surprise \"merry Christmas, how've you been?\" But I'm working on it. Christmas felt like a good excuse to at least reach out to my more casual friends that I lost touch with, so I seized it, and am glad I did.\n\nIt's hard. For one of my best friends that I reached out to a couple months ago, I had to start with an email just laying out what's been going on with me. I don't like to rely on my depression as an \"excuse,\" and I don't expect everyone to accept my experience and take me back, but nonetheless it is a relevant reason. And anyone who understands that well enough to give sympathy will likely be willing to pick up where things left off. Others may not give a fuck, and I may be better off without them. The hard part is people who otherwise would give a fuck, but truly don't understand, and sincerely can't help but to feel slighted by my abandonment. Those will be harder to accept, but you can't make everyone understand.\n\nEither way, all you can do is reach out and see where they land. But you have to reach out to start that process. I've only had the energy to do so because of mental scaffolding (getting back to hygienic routines, exercising, cooking/eating better, cutting back on weed, etc).\n\nOne thing I'm realizing is how reliant my mental health used to be on my social relationships. Without them, things would spiral more easily, and it'd be easy for me to feel like I had no purpose, and no energy. But reconnecting is making other productivity easier. It's like a positive feedback loop: exercising/healthy diet/basic productivity makes it easier to reach out socially &gt; reaching out socially makes exercising/etc. easier &gt; more exercising/etc. makes socializing easier &gt; ad infinitum.\n\nWe're social animals. We're generally at our best when we connect and cooperate. I say this as a lifelong introvert. Depression is a bitch, but it is treatable, and that's the hardest thing to fathom when you're in the throes of that mental pit. But if you can claw your way out (which is easier with help), then it doesn't have to be a life sentence. Good luck to all the other strugglers out there. I'll leave off with one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite fictions:\n\n&gt;*\"Struggle,\u00a0contend,\u00a0wriggle! That alone is the sword of one who confronts [a preventable] death [or depression, which feels like death]!*\"\n\n(Brackets my own interpretation.)",

It can feel like a physical burden you carry with you. You feel like you can't handle it, so you stay in, and away, because you can't carry it and also have energy left over for the normal human stuff.\n\nBut also, you don't want to make other people carry that burden. You don't want to have other people carry something that is your responsibility, and maybe... your fault. \n\nBut persistent reaching out, and invitation (not guilt) is very helpful, even if it seems like a lot.

When someone is in that depressed, anxious state they start to second guess every interaction, and written messages leave a lot of room for (pessimistic) interpretation. I sometimes was stressed out for days because of planned meetings or something with colleagues and then it turned out that nobody really expected anything specific from me and it was just a chill status update. People like to shit on emoji but they can be very helpful as hint for the recipient so they don't read too much into a text that seems totally harmless but can be kind of ambiguous on the other side.",

Of course you want to be there and help your friend, but sometimes relationships with people who struggle with mental health can be straining. \n\nBeing able to draw boundaries is extremely important. It can be difficult to determine when and where to draw those lines, and maybe sometimes mistakes will be made, but those mistakes can be corrected or mitigated with communication. \n\nSometimes you might just have to go through the shit with each other, then regroup and figure out what went wrong. The regrouping is the most important aspect. Someone like your friend, who feels like a burden and likely feels extremely anxious when a friendship hits some rocks, needs to know that turbulence doesn't equal friendship over. \n\nIt's perfectly normal for people to not get along 100% of the time. It should be more normal for people to say things like \"I need a moment for myself\" or \"I feel overwhelmed with *blank* right now, can I get back to you when I'm in a better head space?\" without it coming across as anything but necessary self care. \n\nNormalize that kind of communication in your friendship (if you haven't already) and, maybe most importantly, make sure that you make an active effort to get back in touch with your friend after requesting a boundary. \n\nAnd besides making sure to reassure an anxious friend that you're not going anywhere, this doesn't just apply to friendships involving mental health struggles. Healthy boundaries and communication are extremely important to any relationship, however that may look",

And that's enough. And then she disappears again for a while. But I just wanted her to know that I'm here. She's not a shitty friend. I love her. She knows that other people's lives go on, but if she reaches out, she won't be alone. \n\n\nOn the other hand: I have always been a hermit. Not good at communicating. I communicate through texts and actual cards. One of my best friends is very social. She craves the social interaction with people. This has caused quite a rift because she wants to hang out and talk on the phone. And I've been trying to be like that for years. Every once in a while she gets upset with me, calling me a shitty friend because she's going through a rough time and needs a friend to talk to, totally dismissing my problems. So recently we got into a little argument and she ended our relationship for the fourth time. \nThat's NOT how to deal with it. The more pressure she puts on me, the harder it gets for me to contact her for a nice chat. When she calls I'm like \"oh crap there we go again\".",

While neither of these thoughts is logically true, my brain still does backflips to make me believe by bringing up all the times they were even so much as slightly annoyed with me as justification.    \nSometimes people with anxiety get so into their heads that they end up coming full circle and reaching out to the person. Sometimes they do not and it ends with a complete shut down of the thought process just to get away from the invasive and often times fully negative thoughts about someone we care about. \n\nI can completely understand being tired of reaching out to the same friends over and over. It gets exhausting.  I would suggest that the next time you have the energy to reach out to a friend in this situation, try being bluntly honest with them.  It has a chance to break them out  of the anxious/depressive cycle.    \n\n\nIf you do consider reaching out one more time, something like \"Hey, I enjoy being your friend but right now it feels one sided.  If you are feeling the need to talk, please do. I'll be here.\"  or something similar may help both your mental/emotional health as well as theirs.  Leaving it open ended is a great way to make sure the person understands that it is on them to continue the relationship when they are up to it.",

They\u2019d planned that on their birthday the brother would call him at some designated time, but when the time came he never received the call, and he was super sad all day that his brother rejected him. He later realizes that his brother *had* called him, but his phone wasn\u2019t hooked up correctly so it wasn\u2019t receiving calls. So when they eventually got in contact some day in the future, he told his brother how he felt, and his brother asked \u201cWhy didn\u2019t *you* just call *me*?\u201d And the speaker says that it hadn\u2019t occurred to him that *he* could reach out, instead of waiting for his brother to do so.\n\nThis is something I\u2019ve definitely grappled with quite a bit in my life: I can be upset about friends not reaching out to me, while I rarely muster up the courage to reach out to them. It\u2019s easier to blame depression and social anxiety to justify why *I* don\u2019t do it, but somehow I assume that *they* have full capability agency and are just choosing to exclude me? When the reality could really be a mix of them also having similar issues as me, combined with them thinking that if I haven\u2019t reached out I\u2019m probably not interested.",

I see most of them once or twice a year, when we travel for summer holidays and arrange to visit (not spending the night, just dropping by). When I do we have a great time chatting and having a meal together or going out somewhere, with or without kids depending on the situation. \n\nThen we keep in touch via the occasional text/FB post/postcard/chat, not that often but now and then. I remember birthdays and try to send a greeting then. And when we meet again the next year we have a great time again.\n\nFor me those friendships are valid and important even though they are sporadic and initiated mostly by me. I still feel welcome and appreciated. Always leave them an \"out\" when I ask if we might stop by (phrase it so it is clear it's only if it's convenient for them), yet they never take the \"out\" (unless someone's ill or away). So it must mean something to them too! \n\nI have 7 different friends that I have this relationship to, 5 of them know each other but rarely interact (we all live in separate locations).\n\nIf I didn't feel it was wanted or appreciated to have this contact I would drop it. But as long as it's mutually appreciated I'll continue!",

If you \"pry\" at me that's not going to help, it's just going to make me feel trapped in a social situation I didn't ask for. But my friend is completely opposite, he thinks he wants to be alone but being alone just increases his negative thoughts. When I notice he's feeling down I just go there, whether he likes it or not. We play games and I let the talking come from him. Usually there's something he just needs to let out and when it's out he goes back to being a social butterfly. I think a good general approach is to offer being there for them, but let them lead the situation to where they're comfortable. That is, if it doesn't take a toll on you. You can't help a friend if you need help yourself, so always put yourself first when it comes to mental health.",

I think an important addendum to the whole post by OP is this - mental health issues can be great reasons for some unideal behavior or problematic tendencies, but it doesn't 100% EXCUSE IT or mean that no one is allowed to feel negatively impacted by it. That's a toxic mentality that just takes all agency away from individuals struggling with mental illness and at it's worst is like a cop-out with some twisted selfishness or narcissism. People don't have to be okay with your behavior, even if they genuinely empathize. Empathizing with the feeling and experience and condoning behavior are not the same. \n\n If you are struggling, you may have a support net and folks with saintly tolerance and patience but this does not preclude your need for professional help and dedication to attempt to learn to care for yourself better. If you don't want to burden others - get help! \"Releasing your friends\" of the burden of having you, their loved one, isn't kind to them nor is it kind to you. It may be scary and exhausting to go seek professional help but please do it, and if you are struggling with that see if your friends can help support you in it.\n\nALSO, just because someone is in recovery or coping with their mental illness more successfully than you doesn't mean they're full of shit and must have not been struggling as hard as you, or \"don't get it\". Maybe they do, and maybe you should listen... or perhaps when you connect, focus on the feelings and not making comparisons about who has it worse, or if one of your experiences are more valid or not.  Depression can make you really self-centered. The mind is fucking powerful and you really are in a battle with yourself. It's hard. It takes a lot of courage and vulnerability to address it, to doubt your modus operandi, to seek help.",

Recognizing that I'm not holding up my end of the deal and expecting others to do it for me was pretty eye opening. The hard part of it is to not let that negative self talk; the voice that says \"I am a miserable sack that should just go away\" start taking over. It turns out that by telling yourself that, you're still being pretty self-centered. It is you making the decision for others about who they want in their lives and that's not fair either. All you need to do is send a text that says \"hey I miss you and I hope you are doing well.\" Sometimes other people just need to hear those words, even if you're not up for a call or company. At least that way they know that when you don't answer the phone, it's not because of them.\n\nAnd that goes the other way around too - if there's someone in your life that gets really sad, anxious, reclusive; just send that text. Let them know they are thought of and cared about. Put the vibe out there and let it be. None of us can control what another person feels, but we can all choose to consider a viewpoint that doesn't put our own feelings at the center.\n\nYmmv.",

It doesn't matter how much you care.  She had no desire to actually deal with it and as a result the friendship is dead. I am actually much happier without constantly feeling like I need to check on her or be her friend. Why bother? There was no reciprocity and I had turned into some weird momma care taker.

At the same time, you'll see a lot of comments on this post that confirm that 99% of the time, that people who are isolating really appreciate and benefit from people reaching out and inviting them to things regularly.\n   \nNow, sometimes people don't respond because they are annoyed, or maybe they just don't like you that much.

That's why I said that isolating **is** being a bad friend. Few people have done that for me, but the few that have I'm extremely grateful for, and I've slowly gotten better over the years at responding.\n    \nIf the friend means a lot to you, then you could even talk with them about this. Maybe you could impress upon them how much it would mean just to get a response from them whenever they're up to it. Nothing long-winded or in depth, but just a response.

A series of tragedies happened for me (divorce, mom, dad and brother died, lost home, business and self esteem, and had a horse riding accident that changed me forever health wise). Fought the depression hard and with everything I had but seemed to get nowhere. I have no children, and no extended family, no grandparents, etc.,\n\nPeople pull away, I feel guilty for shutting down, my health went into the toilet with autoimmune diseases I didn't know I had. I feel like a huge burden on people, so I withdraw.\n\nI now live alone in a strange town with no friends, family, neighbors who I try to get to know  but they are loners too. I don't even have a primary care physician here.\n\nDon't shut people out if they go dark on you. It's not ghosting or lack of love, it's lack of love for self and guilt and not knowing how to start again. The longer someone goes with no love or contact, the more they believe they deserve none. \n\nI used to have family and friends and a life. Reach out to people, they could be like me. They aren't bad friends, they are in turmoil, pain and are suffering more than you will ever know.",

Before I did, I let them know I've been going through some stuff and that I needed some time. It's been 6 months and they still ask me if I'm okay, that they're here for me etc. on my social media. I also receive postcards from them. A friend who lives close to me was so worried that I didn't respond that she called the police to check up on me. I'm so fucking grateful to have friends like them, but I am in no shape to make contact with them at the moment. All I want to do is hug them and tell them they're one of the reasons why I felt so loved and missed throughout this dark period. It's thanks to them I keep waking up and trying every single day. I'm crying just thinking of them. I wish I could be a better friend... But I'm in a bad headspace now and I don't want to burden them, it's something I have to solve on my own, with the help of my psychologist. Once I am better, I'll tell them all about it and how they've saved me. Man, I really don't deserve them. I feel like an asshole because I haven't reached out yet, but I don't want to talk to anyone, not yet. I hope they understand. :(",

I would also like to add that one of the reasons I struggle to reinitiate contact is that in my head, the fact that they also haven't been in touch with me means that they don't like me anymore, or maybe even never liked me and we're just acting as if they did. (I have quite severe social anxiety as well as depression.) And on really bad days it becomes a case of \"well they haven't bothered to get in touch with me so they clearly don't care all that much so why should I bother?\"\n\nLogically, I know that this is all nonsense. Everyone has busy lives, it's easy to get distracted/forget about things, and it's very possible that they're feeling exactly the same!",

            "comment": "Depression made my grandparents never talk to me again and use me as a scape goat for their \"almost divorce\" you see how quickly people switch up when you stop jumping thru hoops to maintain relationships with them. I didn't validate and get involved in their drama so I don't deserve a family... That's what they believe if I had known they were so cold I would have never invested time and energy trying to be in their lives at all.  Depression gave me the true perspective vs my normal peaceful, open-minded , people pleasing  perspective. Depression hit me hard after my mom died and no one gave a f*ck how I felt, what I was going thru or how they could offer help.. All their selfishness and greed came out instead and that's the last thing I was expecting. \nInstead of understanding and giving me space they judged me, talked negative behind my back and contributed to my depression and instability. They made it difficult for me to trust any human for 7 whole months unable to leave the house locked in a room crying everyday. Ill never forget that pain and begging for death to just take me cause living in a world filled with people so evil was worthless to me. \n\nThe only thing that saved me and taught me a lot was being completely fearless and almost welcoming death. People who tried to scare me only pissed me off and I'd laugh and talk sh*t to their faces about how stupid they looked and I really put some evil mfs in their place lol I'm surprised that I'm still alive sometimes.. I was just bold and spoke my truth without fear and no matter how mad they got or what they were able to take from me they couldn't kill me, make me commit suicide or confuse me for long. I had never been that way before because I feared being honest with people only because I cared how they thought about me but I found out that being nice doesn't make people like you, being yourself apologetically makes people respect you and if they are also living authentically there's an automatic bond and instant trust.",

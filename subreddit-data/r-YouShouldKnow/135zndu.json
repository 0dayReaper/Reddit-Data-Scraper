    "postText": "Why YSK:  when I went to Germany a few years ago, I brought my phone which had Verizon.  I was planning on using the Verison international plan which was something like $15.00 a day.  When I arrived, my phone crashed.  I ended up buying a cheap smart phone and a SIM card.  I was there for 10 days and the phone and sim card ended up being much cheaper than the plan would have been.  Local sim cards are cheap, they work well, and they may even work better than your international plan.\n\nEdit: sim not sims lol",

So I can have my normal sim disabled for data but enabled for making calls. Or you can enable data for both if you want to use two different networks when worried about not having signal.\n\nYou can still receive texts and calls on either number, you\u2019re just deciding which to send from.",

I ran into people as recently as March this year, that were doing the same thing.  \n\nThere is good and bad to it.  It can make communication a little tougher since you don't have your regular number.  I always used an old phone, because it had most of my information already in it, and I happened to have one stolen one time.  It sucked, but I lost a cheap phone with a prepaid card in it - it definitely could have been worse.  The advantages are obvious - you can use it without worry of a big phone bill at the end of the month.  I know on our last trip, the couple next to us was paying the $10 or $15/day, for each line.  On an 11 day trip, that adds up.",

In the parent's briefing we were all told to NOT let them take their cell phones as they wouldn't work in Italy anyway. (This was back when practically all phones in the US were locked to the carrier, and many of them used CDMA only.) My immediate thought was that was a stupid recommendation. There's no reason my daughter has to be completely out of touch except when they let her use a pay phone to call collect back to the US.\n\nA quick online search revealed there were a number of companies that sell unlocked GSM phones that were compatible with European SIM cards. You could rent or buy the phone, and buy the SIMs for each country you expected to be in. I bought her a Motorola clamshell and an Ita-Mobile SIM. It came with a European compatible charger, and they threw in a T-Mobile SIM preloaded with 100 hours of talk time so that she could call from airports in the US.\n\nMy daughter ended up being the only person on the trip who had a cell phone that worked in Italy. When a family emergency came up involving one of the kids on the trip, the school's administrator called me. He said he'd heard my daughter had a cell phone, and wanted to know if it would be ok if he called her phone since he desperately needed to reach the teacher who was leading my daughter's group. Of course, I said yes, and gave him the number. I also told him that if another parent needed to reach their kid then it would be fine if he gave them my daughter's number. Incoming calls weren't charged against her SIM. The caller paid for those calls. The only time my daughter needed the phone was the one time per day when I called her to check in. The rest of the day the other students were using it.\n\nThere are little shops everywhere that sell cards for adding minutes to a SIM account. My daughter never had to buy one of those cards. The other students who were using her phone always pitched in to buy them.\n\nBefore going abroad, check to ensure that your phone is unlocked, and that it supports the cellular standard used in the countries you plan to visit. GSM-900 and GSM-1800 are used in most of the world. GSM-850 and GSM-1900 are used in most of the Americas. Also, make sure your phone supports the type of SIM cards used in the countries you will visit.\n\nIf you don't have a compatible phone then you can still rent or buy a compatible phone and SIM, with a limited number of minutes included. The company I used is [Cellular Abroad](https://www.cellularabroad.com/), but there are many others.",

You\u2019re far better off getting a pay-as-you-go plan or pre-paid SIM card after you land at your destination. \n\nAside from plain old gouging, I think Canadian carriers want us to believe that mobile service is even more expensive other places, which is a complete up-ending of reality. I know people who maintain US postal addresses just so they can keep their US phone plans: their \u201croaming\u201d fees are cheaper than Canadian local charges.",

    "postText": "Why YSK: American Express has not communicated this to any of their customers that use American Express Travel and, in fact, on their bookings pages they only mention their fares potentially being lower than on partner websites (does this count as false advertising?). No mention of American Airlines fares not being fully represented. This leaves customers in a position of potentially paying double-digit percentages (in my case, +30%) more than they would otherwise since they can't get the lowest American Airlines fares, believing they are seeing the full representation of the fares when they browse/try to book flights via Amex Travel.\n\nI found this out since I had a travel credit for American Airlines (via Amex Travel) that I had to use and did some shopping on Google since their travel booking interface is easier to use. I found a fare that worked for me and called into Amex Travel to book it using my credit and they shared the information that I could not purchase it through them.",

Apparently need to write an Excel sheet to convert points to optimize. Really inconvenient. Should've just bought Priority Pass for lounge access and continued using my Double Cash card.",

A lot of people tend to associate people with anxiety/depression/other mental health conditions to be for  quiet, reserved, introverts.\n\n\nWhile this can be true, it isn't always the case. So many people get shocked/don't believe me when i open up about my personal issues because i am an extrovert and a performer and \"seem\" to do people related things \"effortlessly\" (this is just the fake it till you make it method. Never made it lol, most things still terrify me). I can't tell y'all the number of times I've been told I'm just fishing for attention if i let people know. This has just made me more and more reserved on an emotional level and now i hate talking about feelings even when it's someone i can trust. My panic attacks have gotten worse and i have a hard time reaching out for help when when i know i need it. \n\n\nPlease be mindful of people in general, regardless of whether they seem socially reserved or not. You NEVER know what they are going through. Making a judgement of someone based on their exterior personality only pushes them away. Just because someone is good at something (socializing, public speaking, performing etc) does NOT mean it is a pleasant and comfortable position for them to be in!\n\n\nHave you had any expereince with this?\n\n\nETA: I'm absolutely blown away by the response this has gotten within an hour. I'm trying to reply to all you beautiful people!\n\nEdit 2: holy shirt, my first award?! Thank you so much kind strangers!! This is one weird day\n\nFinal edit: words can't described how overwhelmed i am. I don't know if i can respond to evryone, but i am trying to read as much as i can so please don't stop commenting if you need to. My DM's are open for anyone who needs to talk. Remember, you are loved, you are worthy. I hope each and evryone one of you are having an amazing day. Even the negative nancy's!",

When my anxiety started I felt like I was getting swallowed by a massive nothingness. It was horrible. I had a horrifying sense of dread 24/7 and felt disconnected from my body. The only place that felt safe was my bed. Eventually my mom flew in to yank me out of it and take me to a Doctor, and I started to feel better. But the feeling would come and go and the fear of that dread was pretty intense. \n\nAnd then, very strangely, people I hadn\u2019t seen in years while randomly open up to me about their experiences going through exactly what I had been through. The craziest one was with a friend from college who I ran into on the street one day, but he was on the phone so we just waved at each other. He texted me after and told me he had been on the verge of a panic and was talking to his mother to calm down. When I told him I knew exactly what he was feeling, he let it all out. He had been really struggling. I hadn\u2019t done more than wave or hi to this guy for years. \n\nNow when I have bad days I just say what I\u2019m feeling out loud. My partner doesn\u2019t quite understand, but he listens, and that\u2019s enough to help me get through. Im lucky I met him.",

And if I was confident or just pretending to be confident about the things I was anxious about that would mean I had overcome the anxiety to do that (in that aspect). At least that is how it feels for me. I have a phobia of dogs, so being around any dog even in a \"safe\" environment causes me great anxiety. I couldn't even think about acting confident in such a situation, I couldn't fool myself let alone others. Does that make sense?",

Having anxiety actually makes your brain function differently. It\u2019s almost as if you have two faces. One, shown to only those closest to you, is the one with anxiety. The other, shown to all others is the one that everyone else sees, full of confidence. Normally, for someone without anxiety, self depreciating humour might make them feel worse. In someone with anxiety (or at least me) it helps put up a shield of confidence. It protects you, as others think you are fine making jokes about how terrible you look. For me certainly, it helps prevent panic attacks.\n\nEdit: the dogs thing is a phobia, not directly related to anxiety, but can lead to it in CERTAIN situations\n\nEdit 2: I can\u2019t hide it from myself that\u2019s for sure. But if you can hide it from others like I manage to, then others will think of you as confident, and that reduces the risk of panic attacks at least for me",

He didn\u2019t want to be my promoter anymore (\u2018I can\u2019t work with someone as unprofessional as you\u2019) but luckily another professor stepped in, who knew how difficult mental health problems and anxiety can be. She gave me all the freedom to work on it and assured me it was okay if I took a bit longer to respond to her mails. I was able to graduate in my major just because of her, and her reassurance (and of course the therapy) actually helped me in toning down the anxiety\n\nI still have slight problems though. A few weeks ago I had a fuck-up at work and had to send an email asking for help to somebody higher up. I was already nervous beforehand because this person has quite the notorious reputation. I made absolutely sure the email was as polite as could be, explaining what happened and reassuring them it wouldn\u2019t happen again in the future. I immediately got a furious email back. I nearly had a panic attack over it (I haven\u2019t had any in three years) and my boyfriend had to come sit next to me to help type my response. The following weeks I had to really force myself to check my mailbox daily because this situation triggered my anxiety again",

I end up talking to them quite a bit and some even know me by name and most recognize me. \n\nBut I've noticed that more intimate conversations are a problem for me. Not like sexual intimacy but like really talking and communicating instead of just the \"how are you today\" dance routine.\n\nI think it's because you can easily walk away from the first situation. You don't need to follow all of the usual steps of social interaction and accepted norms which I think are silly anyway. For example just leave or say goodbye on the way out no need to make a whole situation out of it like everyone does and don't get offended when someone just bounces if you didn't have something pending with them. \n\nYou can't play the \"real talk\" situations the same way. In those conversations people are usually trying to find out what you're all about and as a \"people pleaser\" that makes me uncomfortable. What if I say the wrong thing or have an opinion that heavily clashes with one of theirs and they end up hating me before just knowing who I am outside of my beliefs.\n\nI dunno, it all boils down to the fact that we are just really complicated and different with how we perceive the world, and how others perceive us. It's just a mess. We need to be telepathic/empaths to really see where each other is coming from.",

            "comment": "It breaks my heart to see so many of you talking about the same defense mechanisms I leaned on for years; being the joker in school because making people laugh meant they liked me. Then the party girl in college who thought hooking up meant they liked me. Finally Super Wife &amp; Super Mom who took care of everything and everyone else first because that made them love me.\n\nNobody was *ever*allowed to see the other side of me, the side that lived in constant fear. Fear of pretty much everything, I was scared of things that would make very little sense to most people. Having conversations with strangers made my hands sweat. Answering the phone, going to the grocery store, driving to work, asking questions about anything, attending parties, school functions or large gatherings of any kind; all of that made me anxious and scared to varying degrees.\n\nI covered it up with false bravado and stupid jokes, outwardly I was bold, brash, strong, intelligent and brave. When I left my rotten marriage I heard from so many people how amazingly strong I was, what an inspiration I was to my daughters and how proud they were of me. They had no clue how much strength it *actually*took and how little I had left.\n\nI managed (not very well) to keep it going another few years but it eventually came to a crashing halt with a 72 hr forced hold at the hospital and 3 months off from work trying to put the broken pieces of myself back together. I had pretended to be someone else for so long that I really didn\u2019t know who I was anymore. I didn\u2019t know how to be me. \n\nThat was almost 2 years ago and I\u2019m doing much better today but I have wasted most of my life hiding and covering up how I was really feeling, simply because I thought nobody would like me if they knew. I was so afraid of being judged and found not worthy enough of love or acceptance that I never stopped to realize that the love and acceptance people showed the other side of me wasn\u2019t real because *she wasn\u2019t real.*\nSo please, get help! Take the drugs, do the therapy, talk to a professional mental health worker and let them help you. Don\u2019t be me, don\u2019t waste your life on fear and anxiety, there\u2019s so much more and better things to be doing! If I can do it so can you.\n\nTL;DR: anxiety is a beast that can be killed, don\u2019t waste your life trying to hide from it, get help and live the life you deserve!",

My husband does all the grocery shopping because I just can't handle it. Basically, this interferes majorly with my daily life.\n\nMine manifests as \"high controlling of conversation,\" not shyness. I've had multiple therapists say \"I just don't see it. You're so well spoken and engaging.\" Just because I can fake it to avoid exposing my sheer terror, doesn't mean it's not real.\n\nI might be socially capable or just a little awkward, but I am on high alert the entire time I'm being social. It's a cover up I've been using for years so people don't notice my anxiety. \n\nThe hardest part of conversations is when people aggressively challenge what I've said. My mind was not prepared for a battle, so now I'm super on edge. I don't think people do it to be mean, but what they see as normal is difficult for me to handle. Then I'll go home and replay the scenario in my head for days only to convince myself that I'm soooo awkward and weird and nobody wants to hang out with me. It becomes a vicious cycle.",

I'm fine talking to people face to face, but will analize every word I said that night and regret Everett syllable. Yesterday I had to call my boss my heart was racing so fast my hands where shaking. And finally, since my friends don't reach out to contact me besides our monthly DND sessions, I am certain that they do not like me and only tolerate my presence at a group level since I have ingratiated myself enough in the group that I have become one of the lesser members. Individually they detest me and are annoyed by my every actions and words.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: after reading a bunch of other people's comments I realized I have a lot more situations where my anxiety acts up than I realized. I know you probably will not see this, but thank you to everyone who commented.",

I'm a functional individual, and I put on an extremely convincing mask, but behind that mask of functionality I'm *always* dealing with racing thoughts, elevated heart rate, and a knot in my gut that is so tight some days that I'll reject what I eat **before** it even fully hits my stomach. Thankfully that last one doesn't happen often, but it's still a bitch when it does happen. \n\nI don't open up to anyone anymore because I either got the \"you have no idea what depression/anxiety are like because you grew up with a good childhood\" or \"OMG poor baby let me fix you at the expense of my own well being\". \n\nI've withdrawn from almost all my friends because I have no emotional energy to spend on them, and I don't want to suck what little joy they have left out of them. I've been doing therapy over the phone but I feel like it isn't doing anything. Kinda makes it worse in a sense because I have phone anxiety. But it's all I can do because 'rona.",

After keeping the act going i cant wait to be alone and let this mask slip coz its frickin exhausting always being so 'up ' and being the person to keep conversations going and amuse everyone. If i ever mention that im actually a really anxious person i am always immediately told that im lying and that there is no way. Because i am so 'fun' in public i find i get invited to more social occasions and people are drawn to me coz they enjoy my 'persona' which is even more draining and anxiety inducing xx",

It\u2019s an oxymoron. \n\nI have a friend who makes exactly this point, she\u2019s always going on about her anxiety, but she is not shy at all when speaking to strangers, shop assistants, waiters etc, in fact she\u2019ll usually strike up a conversation with them very easily and enjoy it. She\u2019s not afraid to talk over people or talk loud or speak her mind.That doesn\u2019t scream social anxiety to me. \n\nI actually do have diagnosed social phobia so I really don\u2019t get this, sorry if I\u2019m ignorant but it seems like OP is well on their way to recovery if they are challenging themselves to fake it til they make it. Well done OP. Keep on faking it!",

I'm good at social and bridging gaps between people who dont know each other. I was blessed with a social gene for these things that make me the extrovert of most stuff.\n\nInternally most days are hell. Most days are full of anxiety I can't identify but cant shake. Fear over every little damn thing that could go wrong growing into enormous calamity. \n\nHad a meeting with a psychologist a few months back who plainly said, \"I don't understand why you're here.\" That was the end of that, and boy did it feel upsetting.\n\nI've been making an effort to not make an effort in social situations and it's helpful for me. It feels good to shed the burden of needing to be social to stem other people's awkwardness. Maybe it's selfish, but it just isn't our job to do that for them, and I think in the end all it does is stunt their growth on their own personal journey towards overcoming.\n\nWho knows?",

What happened was that there was a noted association between grain free diets and DCM.  This led the FDA to begin an investigation into the association.  They spent a few years looking at it, but after 4 years of investigation they decided they didn't have enough data to continue the research and very specifically said they had \"not established a causal relationship\".\n\nThere are a couple of problems with the way this is being interpreted.\n\n1) DCM can take *years* to show signs, so 4 years of investigation is not necessarily sufficient to make a conclusion in either direction.\n\n2) The kinds of long term cohort studies needed to truely assess for a causal link are *extremely expensive and extremely time consuming*.  The FDAs investigation effectively only reached the conclusion that they had reached the limit of the time and money they would be willing to put into this research.\n\n3) Establishing a causal relationship is **extremely** difficult.  Look back in history at the mountain of research that was required before we were able to definitively say that smoking causes cancer if you want to get an idea how difficult it actually is to prove x causes y.\n\n***Bottom line:***\nWhile the FDA has stopped their investigation, that does not necessarily mean that grain free diets are safe.  Even though the data about its dangers is vague, grain free diets provide absolutely no benefit to dogs over grain inclusive diets.  There is no reason to feed a grain free diet.  I would challenge you to find a single veterinary nutritionist who would not still recommend avoiding grain free diets.",

They made grain free lines and meat specific and a whole other range of low and medium tier foods. \n\nWhat I understood as a freshman bio major (so not much), and what was explained by the always non scummy higher ups, if a bit generic at times...was that the first study that broke was flawed, subsequent one was found to have some conflicts of interests and there was a recant somewhere involved as well. \n\nAs for the science behind it all, I was told that Taurine *seemed* to be a culprit, and if indeed found to be, a marketing decision could be to blame. No by products specifically. The thinking was, **by-products**, which can be from good sources but sound bad (internal organs and other waste items from butchering) on the bag. Many low grade foods use by product meal and those who read it and want to care about food  turn away from it. Even if the by-product is from well regulated and quality sources. The reason this is important is because many internal organs have lots of Taurine. And that many non-mega brands in the growing specialty pet food markets got rid of By-products, especially so in grain free foods where everyone is looking at the the ingredients. \n\nPeople don't even like a meal made with a specific meat like *chicken meal*. But technically is is more bioavailable than whole meat, and because they weigh before whole meat is dehydrated and the ingredients are listed in order by amount, goods featuring whole meat sold better. \n\nWhat you want to avoid are cheap brands with by products and non specific meat meals. Meat meals are fine and from quality sources and are better than just whole meat ingredients in kibble. Unless you are going for a specific diet where you supplement like in the case of those who generally feed Orijen or mushers and working dogs. What's generally best for the average pooch is both whole meat and meat meal (from specific animals)",

No negative side effects or anything this is a sitter we use a lot and he broke into their food stash once and had the food before. My dog is a corgi with an iron stomach who wants to eat everything.

Brands such as Royal Canin, Hill's Science Diet, and Purina. These foods often have ingredients that are missing (such as taurine) compared to other brands and don't contain ingredients that contribute to health problems such as DCM.\n\nThere's a ton of controversy around these brand foods. Some of the criticisms imo are for good reason (Purina for example is unfortunately owned by Nestle), but the controversy is also in part due to the rising trend of raw diets, the couple of recalls that have occurred over the past few years, AND due to the often misinformed theory that veterinarians are profiting from pushing these brands (which they're not).\n\nThe main thing that sucks of course is these brands are far more expensive compared to other grain free brands. It's a problem.",

He coughs usually when the seasons change, when it\u2019s super dry inside, and when I use heavily scented things in the house. When it gets super bad, like multiple coughing fits every day, I bring him to the vet, they take an X-ray and listen to his lungs, and he gets a steroid for a couple weeks and that stops it for a long time.

We brought him to the vet the next day and they said he had heart failure and we had to put him down. I\u2019m not sure if we missed any signs and attributed them to his hyperthyroidism. But there was likely nothing they could do for him anyways even if we caught it earlier because his hyperthyroidism was already killing him.",

It sounded like he had something in his throat he was trying to get out, kinda like a cat hairball. \n\nWe took him to the vet and they said it was heart failure, but he was was close to the late stages but hadn't started yet. He's been on medication since which has kept him in that same spot.\n\nHis cough increased over the years, but it still remains dry. He started coughing every day, then once or twice a day. Then he was coughing after exercise too and slowing down on his walks. His coughs became shallower, smaller, and he will cough 2-3 times in a row instead of one big cough.\n\nRight now, he's 16 and he coughs at least once an hour. His enlarged heart pushes on the organs inside and makes him cough more. It also takes less to make him cough, even waking up from a deep sleep is enough to trigger a cough these days.\n\nWe take him to the vet every 6 months expecting bad news that he's declining, but he remains on the border. The doctor did say that when the cough becomes more wet in nature, that's when the decline is happening.\n\nI also monitor his breaths per minute when he's sleeping. He was at 30 (high) before he was diagnosed. Over the years since he's been on medication his breathing rate is between 12-24, depending on how deep his sleep is and if he's dreaming.\n\nSorry to bombard you with info, but just want to get our experience out there in case it helps others.",

So get it checked out soon after noticing... medicine can greatly enhance their quality of life and let them stick around with us longer.  It can be a bit pricey for some folks, though sure. My dog takes pimobendan and furosemide, which costs me about $50 per month, but he's worth it. For the first couple of years he only needed the furosemide, which was much cheaper, around $10-15 a month. Vet added on pimobendan when his symptoms started coming back after 2-3 years. now he has very few symptoms again since then. Hopefully he will die of old age, not heart failure.

    "postText": "Why YSK: \n\nContact your local department of natural resources for specific guidelines relative to your area. There are varying levels of risk of bird flu and other avian diseases depending on your location, but this can be critically important if you have birds as livestock as well. Any sick or dead birds should probably be reported to your local DNR as well.\n\nSongbirds are of a lower risk to avian flu, but even if you aren't concerned about the avian flu, you should still regularly clean and sanitize your bird feeders to prevent any other diseases from spreading as well. There are also preventative measures that you can take for ponds and bird baths.\n\nI am by no means a bird expert, but you should certainly put some thought into what you have in your yard. Certainly take the time to Google local guidance on bird flu and bird disease prevention from your local DNR and disease control centers for more information.",

While it is treatable, (if you catch, bring in and medicate) but very contagious for the little guys and can cause blindness\u2026 which ultimately leads to death as they won\u2019t be able to see predators coming",

It's very hard to suss out the difference between increased population density and increased bird feeder density (per bird-capita, lol).\n\nThere's an awful lot of misinformation that swarms around us far too quickly regarding wildlife.  Among the most humorous to me is the \"rice kills birds\" (finally at long last gone) and \"bread is dangerous for ducks\" (both no).  In the mix now is this recurring \"feeding deer can kill them\" which is a hasty conclusion done *without* tox screens.",

And it all traced back to a single Ann Landers article or to nothing at all.",

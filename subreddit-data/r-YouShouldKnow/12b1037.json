    "postText": "Why YSK:\n\n\nIf you mention stomach pain or something and someone starts talking about a \"cure\" it is likely false information. A real health professional would meet you to diagnose you and then talk about treatment, not cures.\n\nThink about it. There are TONS of things that could cause stomach issues. How can someone who has never examined you know exactly what your problem is and also that it can be fixed over with x or y? Health professionals don't treat diseases on such broad guesses. 9/10 times they try to pinpoint what the issue is and treat that because you don't want to treat one of a patient's issues only to cause something else.\n\nSource: [Can We Say \"Cure\"? - National Institute of Health ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145017/)",

My mom's idiot coworker went full crazy during covid (she waffled between \"covid isn't real\" and \"we need to take all this shit to detox our bodies so it can fight off covid\"), and unfortunately I learned that my mom is also an idiot. She got dog dewormer and colloidal silver from her coworker to \"detox\" herself. Of course when I asked what exactly she was trying to detox out of herself, her answer (and her coworker's) was just \"general toxins\"...... Sounds legit.\n\nLuckily, a few pictures of that infamous blue guy got her to stop dosing colloidal silver. She finished the dog dewormer, though...",

It doesn't technically undo the damage, but it can return functionality in what would have otherwise been a chronic disabling injury.\n\nFor other issues, medication will always be your primary mode of treatment because the issue itself is chemical in nature. Much like how physical therapy won't fix type 1 diabetes. (Though maybe it could relieve some symptoms of diabetes damage.)\n\nIf it's within your means, I'd try seeing both the psychologist and psychiatrist.

For example, from what I've been told from multiple psychology professionals and friends and acquaintances with the disorder, BPD rarely responds well to meds but responds wonderfully to CBT. Other disorders, it is just another tool in your arsenal. For me personally, I needed both medications and CBT to help me (I have an alphabet soup but the main ones are anxiety, Bipolar and PTSD). I hope that helps. Nothing is a cure. And a chemical imbalance isn't always permanent but it can be. There are very few people, I feel, that wouldn't benefit in some way from CBT but just giving up one for the other makes me feel like you should tread cautiously around that doctor.",

They often will not tell you about side effects, withdrawal, check for interactions, or tell you how useless they really are. They came to the conclusion that calling it a chemical imbalance hurts, rather than helps patients because depression  doesn't involve just neurotransmitters. It is also psycho/social/bio, and many studies show that serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine do not play a role in depression as previously thought. https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/neurobiology-depression#:~:text=For%20years%20and%20years%2C%20doctors,neurotransmitters%2C%20particularly%20serotonin%20or%20norepinephrine. This study is one of many that I have read. The best thing to do is to target the biology/social and psychology aspects.  We have new treatments out there like Mert/Tms that work for a lot of people. I tried doing ketamine therapy myself. My brain is really weird and I didn't like the ketamine, but it has cured a lot of people. The clinic I went to was accepting Obamacare. If you don't have insurance get government insurance so you can get help. You will be surprised by some of the benefits. Emdr helps with trauma and CBT therapy helps with a wider range of things. Get therapy. Look at clinical trials. Look up MAPS if you are interested in psychedelic treatment. I believe this will be legal soon for therapeutic reasons. Then the doctor should help the depressed individual eat better and exercise. Then you have the social part which is up to you. Stay away from negative people. People sitting in their mammas basement all day gaming need to go outside and get fresh air! It is a combination of a lot of things that create depression, so a combination of things needs to be done to combat it.",

You can only learn to cope and lessen the impact of mental illness. I would begin by talking to a psychologist and see if she can help you, and then ask her if she thinks meds will be beneficial in addition. That\u2019s just my experience though",

Anxiety alone is often difficult to manage with only medications if you also don't want to feel overmedicated.

Meds + CBT may have more benefit overall as antidepressants can be helpful for MDD of you find one that works for you but anxiolytics do not always have the desired effect in as fast a fashion as desired.",

For less severe depression, a combination of therapy, lifestyle changes and possibly medication is normal, but medication is less likely (mostly to avoid side effects, if med-free treatment can be done).  For other MH issues\u2026 idk\n\nCBT and other therapy can be hard to get on the NHS, when I was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression I was just put on medication by my GP.  \n\nYour GP seems to imply that psychiatrists prescribe medication by default regardless of what\u2019s best for you?  Which is not true at all, unless you have a terrible psychiatrist.  CBT is also not a catch all cure.  With the right treatment, some people recover completely, and most people see their symptoms improve.  CBT and antidepressants both have good medical evidence on their own, but combo treatment works even better.  The best course of treatment varies by individual.\n\nA psychiatrist is a doctor specialising in mental health, so, without knowing anything about your doctors, on the subject of mental health I\u2019d generally value the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion over the GP simply because it\u2019s their field.  A psychologist is generally a non-medical expert in the field of psychology, who can administer therapy and help manage Mental Health issues on a more personal level.  You can have both!  If you want to stop medication, it makes more sense to say that to your psychiatrist than to stop seeing them altogether.\n\nBest of luck with your health!",

Some things, therapy (whether it's CBT or any of the numerous modalities out there) can provide long term resolution for. Some things it can lessen but not fully cure. But you won't know until you try it, the same way medication you can't know whether it will help until you try it. \n\nI will say if you do try therapy, go in with an open mind. If you go in thinking for sure it will not work, it won't work because you've already decided it won't. If you're open to the idea of it improving, even if it doesn't fully remove symptoms, you'll see more improvement. \n\nBuy in is an underrated but essential part of the therapeutic process.",

People exist in a moving space and time, as do medical procedures and medications.  Sometimes the simplest seeming problems are easily \"cured\" for one person, and another must go through rounds of trials to find a solution, which might be the same, or utterly different, or never actually found.  Some patients easily overcome an illness that kills other patients.  And so on and so forth.\n\nAny healthcare professional that talks in any absolutes is either poorly educated or grifting (one good clue is the space in which you encounter them, for example, any doctor that goes on media platforms like the Joe Rogan podcast is likely going to be talk in absolutes - this is called \"misinformation\").  Any patient that expects absolutes is ill-informed or willfully ignorant.  There are no cures.  Every treatment has the chance of failure, every disease or disorder has the chance of recurrence, either based on the disease or disorder, or on the treatment.  There are no cures.\n\nThe healthcare industry as a whole has done a really poor job at communicating this aspect of their business.  They've also done a really poor job of not allowing their industry to operate like a business, so it's almost a willful action to not inform.  The basics of human biology and medicine are also not taught in general education to the public as a whole, on average.  And everything centers around skepticism.  So here we are.

Because it implies the disease will never come back which, no doctor in their right mind will guarantee that for anything bc lawsuits \n\n2. They *might* use the word \"cured\" as a state where a patient has no more trace of a disease but that comes after a \"course of treatment\" not by \"taking *a cure*\"\n\n3.

                            "comment": "My background allows me to know a thing or two as well. Your first point is just not true, because you can have the same disease again unrelated to what happened previously. Your second point is correct and reflects reality. The third point is only applicable in some cases, and would be a question of definition.\n\nIf a patient is given antibiotics/antivirals for an infection and recovers without complications, this is called a cure. It even says so in the article you posted originally, where the ND is referring to what he was told by the dean of a conventional medical school. This mere fact means that there are a huge amount of diseases that can be cured. It is not really relevant if the patient gets the same infection 20 years later (or even another influenza the year after), but if they have a string of related infections in a short period of time (like in the example of kids with repeated middle ear infections), then of course one cannot talk about a cure before there has been a more definitive treatment.\n\nBesides infections, other things that may be cured are cancers before a certain stage, injuries (like fractures that can be cured with a cast and/or an operation),  blood clots, certain psychiatric conditions, intoxication/poisoning (through antidote) and so on and so forth. Just because many diseases are chronic and can only be treated/managed, it doesn't mean that there aren't lots of things that can be cured.\n\nSome relevant links:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative\\_care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care)\n\n[https://www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/your-hospitals/bristol-royal-infirmary/what-we-do/ogteam/general-cancer-information/curative-intent-vs-palliative-treatment/](https://www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/your-hospitals/bristol-royal-infirmary/what-we-do/ogteam/general-cancer-information/curative-intent-vs-palliative-treatment/)\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecc.13139](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecc.13139)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553954/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553954/)\n\nWith cancer, one typically refers to curative care or curative treatment, when the disease is at a stage where it is still curable. This is standard terminology. Your first link confirms that many patients are indeed cured of their cancer. This doesn't mean that the oncologist will readily tell the patient that they have been cured, because one can never speak with certainty about this, it is a life threatening disease, a very sensitive subject, and it would mean setting oneself up for future problems. The word cure is more likely to come up before treatment in the context of cancer. Oncologists may say things like \"our aim is to cure you from this\", and then after the completion of a curative cancer treatment: \"the treatment has been successful and we don't expect the cancer to return, though nothing is ever certain in life.\"\n\nBut with a 45 year old who had a blood cancer as a child, and who has been cancer free since, I think few doctors would hesitate to tell the person that they were cured. Also, you're speaking from an American context, which is unique in that doctors get sued for anything and everything. So, I would understand if they are extra careful.",

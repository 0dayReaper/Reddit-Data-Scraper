    "postText": "Why YSK: Many times you watch a YouTube video to do something productive, like a tutorial or an educational video. But then there's the list of Recommended Videos on the right side of the video with a lot of videos that seem more fun than whatever you're doing (since they're recommended by the YouTube algorithm itself). So this extension allows you to remove that list altogether, along with anything else you think you waste too much time on (comments, home feed, mixes etc). It can also be useful if you want to reduce your screen time.\n\n**Edit:** Yes, it removes YouTube Shorts too. [Here's the link for Chrome and Chromium based browsers (Edge, Opera etc)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid), and [here's the one for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/).",

Creates randomized passwords, allows you to sort passwords/accounts into different folders. Syncs between devices. Highly recommended.\n- **Dark Reader** - Dark mode for every website. Adds in the option to make a site's dark/light mode depending on what you want, with multiple filters that create a dark mode in different ways. Big fan, helps save my eyes at night. Works on almost every site I've been across, some sites have weird design elements that don't always play so nice by default, though.\n- **Dark View** - instant filter that makes things darker. Easy on/off by clicking the icon. Also nice at night.\n\n\n## Adblockers &amp; Privacy Add-ons\n- **uBlock Origin** - this is the #1 adblocker that everyone should be using. This should really be added to Firefox as soon as you download it. It does so much more than blocking ads, the list is huge, and it's vital to privacy and making a better browser experience.\n- **DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials** - allows you to replace Google as your default search engine with DDG. Blocks trackers, protects your data, and you don't have to do anything.\n- **Facebook container** - prevents Facebook from being able to track where you've visited, because their little plugins are everywhere. That's how they personalize ads and figure out what you've been looking at. \n- **HTTPS Everywhere** - another layer of encryption and security. Why not?\n- **Malwarebytes** - kills them nasty Malwares. \n- **Nord VPN** - I know, not the best VPN, but I bought a multi-year subscription, and I'm going to get my money's worth out of it before switching.\n- **WOT Website Security** - Gives a nice little rating how safe/unsafe private/not private a website is. Not really necessary.\n- **Fake Anime Site Blocker** - blocks phishing sites posing as anime sites. \n\n## Paywall Blockers\n- **Bypass Paywalls Clean** - allows you to access articles published on news sites with annoying ass paywalls. Because no one wants to deal with a monthly fee when they only want to read a single article and move on.\n- **Paywall-Blocker** - another paywall blocker so you can read articles without dealing with a membership that you don't want.\n\n## Navigation &amp; Tools Add-ons\n- **Swift Selection Search** - allows you to highlight any text and use a search engine of your choice. I played around with it and learned how to get it setup, so I can highlight any text and instantly search YouTube, IMDB for a movie, Amazon or other stores for a product. Probably one of my most used Add-ons\n- **Simple Tab Groups** - absolutely amazing add-on if you have a lot of tabs open, allow you to sort tabs by categories, best paired with:\n- **Total Suspender** - allows you to suspend tabs that have been open for a certain amount of time, if they've been open for a few minutes they're put into a sleep mode that drastically reduces CPU/RAM usage. Fantastic tool, great if you always have too many tabs open that slow things down.\n- **Tree Style Tabs** - I don't really use this in the way that you're supposed to, but I like it because it gives me quick access to the sidebar to check history and open up my bookmarks in the sidebar.\n- **Duplicator** - Duplicates your current tab. Doesn't seem like that big of a deal at first, but it's really handy, and I use it a lot.\n- **Undo Close Tab** - Adds a little button to your toolbar that you can click on to undo a tab you accidentally closed instead of going through your history and reopening the tab, nice time saver.\n- **Image Search Options** - honestly, don't think I've ever used this, would be handy if you need it though.\n- **Show History Frequent Sites Button** - button you can add to your toolbar to get a quick drop-down of freq. used sites, pretty handy \n- **Search by Image** - handy little tool to have, don't use this much, but it's nice.\n\n\n## YouTube Add-ons\n- **Enhancer for YouTube** - hugely improves YT, more or less essential.\n- **SponsorBlock for YouTube** - filter to automatically or manually have the option to skip ads and sponsorships in the video, pretty nice, can set it to skip intro's too. Will definitely save time.\n- **PocketTube** - there's actually multiple PocketTube add-ons, super handy, helps you organize subscriptions into categories and saves time, so you're not wasting even more time scrolling.\n- **BlockTube** - allows you to block accounts/content you're tired of dealing with on YouTube. Kind of fantastic with all the annoying suggested crap that pops up all the time.\n- **Easy YouTube Video Downloader** - download anything from YouTube, in whatever file type you desire. \n- **Return YouTube Dislike** - this should have never disappeared from YouTube. Now you can have it back and give shitty videos/fake reviews the downvotes they deserve. Special note to EA for holding the record of the most downvotes on a single video, I have no doubt there's a correlation between that and the dislike being officially removed.\n\n## Reddit Add-ons\n- **Reddit Ad Remover** - removes promoted posts and ads from reddit\n- **Rededdit real-time** - notifies you when your posts/comments have been removed by mods\n- **Unreddit** - read removed comments from Reddit, sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes it does\n\n## Shopping Add-ons\n- **The Camelizer** - absolutely awesome Amazon price tracking tool, allows you to set up notifications for price drops, check pricing history as recent as the last month, or as long ago as a few years.\n- **Capital One Shopping Coupon Tool** - discount codes\n- **Honey** - Discount Codes\n- **Coupon Birds** - Discount Codes\n-  **RetailMeNot Dead Finder** - Discount Codes\n-  **ReviewMeta Analyzer** - filters fake reviews on Amazon, not sure how effective this is, but it does work at times\n\n## Other Add-ons\n- **Joplin** - my current favorite note-taking app. Actually using it right now to write this all down before pasting it into the comments section. It's simple and easy to use, syncs between devices, and it's free. Used to use Evernote, but they wrecked their whole interface and somehow made one of the best note-taking apps out there terrible. \n- **Dictionary Anywhere** - pretty self-explanatory, nice to have.\n- **Direct Currency Converter** - pick your local currency, and it will convert currencies on any other site to those. Makes things nice if you're shopping for something hard to get or making travel plans.\n- **Flagfox** - basically does nothing important, it's just cool to see what country is hosting the server your current website is using.\n- **Grammar and Spell Checker** - self-explanatory, use this pretty much all the time.\n- **I don't care about cookies** - tired of sites throwing popups about cookies at you? Now they're gone.\n- **Google Translate** - instantly highlight and translate text on a page\n-  **TWP - Translate Web Pages** - honestly this is just an alternative to the basic Google Translate I've been playing around with\n- **Weather** - I like this because it's a nice little icon that shows the temp in the corner of my browser, not really necessary because I already have the weather in better apps. \n- **Worldwide radio** - listen to the radio through your browser.",

It's been years since I needed to do that, so I kind of forget how it works. But it was easy to do when I had to.\n\nHonestly I don't know why you'd switch back and forth once you convert over to Firefox. It's just a far more secure experience. But yes, you can still use Chrome. I keep it installed for government websites because they're coded by morons who have no understanding of mutiple browser compatibility. Edge works well for that too though.",

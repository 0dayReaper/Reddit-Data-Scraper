    "postText": "Why YSK: A common myth is that wine headaches are caused by sulfites (a substance added to wine to prevent spoilage). This is not true. \n\nFoods like french fries, dried fruit, and red meat all contain higher levels of sulfites than wine.\n\nWine headaches are most likely caused by something in wine called *biogenic amines* (histamine). Natural wines, bold red wines, and sparkling wines generally have the highest buildup of histamines. If you get wine headaches, it's best to avoid these.\n\nIf you do get headaches from drinking wine, it's best to stick to white wines and pale ros\u00e9 instead.\n\nTLDR: sulfites aren't causing wine headaches, histamine is the biggest culprit.",

Some are more rigorous than others, but generally speaking it's not too difficult to pass level 1 and get your certification.

It literally can kill you (also don't use DPH recreationally at all, it's really bad for you, unlike most other hallucinogens). You could maybe use newer generation antihistamines though, like cetirizine or others commonly used for allergies. I definitely drunk on those numerous times and nothing bad happened since they're only antihistamines without other effects. And not only they're not hallucinogenic, the newer generation antihistamines also don't act like downers by themselves. So in theory it should be safe (as safe as drinking alcohol gets) or at least much safer than shit like DPH",

I was/am under the impression it is the former and the reason that newer generation antihistamines don't cause drowsiness is because they don't cross the blood-brain barrier well enough to get to the histamine receptors in the CNS responsible for wakefulness. \nmaybe it is a combination of both?",

An important thing here is that the vast majority of drug combinations, including the more dangerous ones, can in theory be used reasonably safely until you hit the point of no return. Which can be really tricky not to cross with downers specifically because they just make people braindead while high on higher doses. Not only people get cocky on alcohol and will do whatever on top of it but another really big problem is that as the night goes on you can easily lose track of how much of what a person already took, resulting in a possible overdose and even death. If I'm not mistaken this is a common theme with GHB overdoses, not even mixed with anything else. Dosing it can get really tricky since you rarely know the exact concentration you get from someone and it's measured in single milliliters and the high doesn't last really long so again it's quite easy to lose track of the consumption if the user doesn't remember his go-to dose and doesn't have sth like a redose timer set. Which is a real shame btw since toxicity-wise it's really safe (metabolises into just CO2 and water or sth like that iirc) but it doesn't belong to the hands of unresponsible users at all and therefore few sell it. And not only it's not toxic at all but the effects are much better than of alcohol. Very similar but on normal doses with zero side effects and no hangover next day\n\nedit: Sorry for the rant lmao, now that I posted it I see how long it really is",

Acetaldehyde build up is responsible for a lot of hangover symptoms and long term health issues associated with alcohol consumption (it's a particularly potent carcinogen). The \"red face\" associated with alcoholics is due to long-term acetaldehyde build up. \n\nSince they're deficient in the necessary enzyme, people with flush syndrome are even worse at converting the acetaldehyde to acetate, or might be unable to do it at all (there are different levels of deficiency, similar to lactose intolerance). Basically, anyone with flush syndrome becomes immediately hungover when they drink alcohol, one of my coworkers will vomit immediately after sipping a drink. People with flush syndrome can build up a tolerance over time, but end up with much higher chances of developing cancer.",

If you are looking for a pill solution to overcome a histamine reaction from a food or drink intake, you will be much better off trying a DAO tablet a few minutes before you imbibe. Another thing that you might want to also try is to not eat high histamine foods while drinking the wine as doing so will only make your reaction worse; dairy (particularly aged cheeses), most nuts, crisps (potato chips for our American friends), pickles, dried fruits, processed sugar and cured meats are just a few of the things that should be avoided. \n\nI love all the above foods as well as wine, but as I've got older I found that I was reacting more severely to the histamine and I've had to severely curtail their intake for the sake of my health.",

            "comment": "White wines won't necessarily avoid the problem, any wine that's been through malolactic fermentation (MLF) will have elevated levels of biogenic amines, which is a common process for wines that see any barrel aging. Buttery chardonnays get their buttery character from MLF, so will likely have higher levels of amines as well. It's also best to avoid pairing with hard, aged cheeses since they also have elevated amine content and can exacerbate the issue\n\nI suspect histamine and other biogenic amines are what're responsible for people that claim they get headaches from MSG. MSG has no real correlation with headaches but histamine sure does. Foods associated with MSG often have bacteria-fermented components. MSG probably isn't causing your headache but drowning your General Tso's in soy sauce might be if you're particularly sensitive to histamine.\n \nFun fact, biogenic amines are also why Bradford Pear trees smell awful. Spermine, spermidine, and to a lesser extent cadaverine and putrescine are responsible for the smell, and they smell like exactly what they sound like (they're named after where they were discovered).",

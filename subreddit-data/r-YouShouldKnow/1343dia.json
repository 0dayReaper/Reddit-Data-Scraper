    "postText": "Why YSK: Because in this way you will avoid getting angry with every cap that doesn't detach from the bottle, without trying in vain to detach it like I did.\n\nBy July 2024 in Europe ALL plastic bottles produced will have the cap which remains (partially) attached to the bottle.\nPlastic is not eco, and we already knew this but with this law hopefully cap and bottle will be trown away togheter, making recycle easier.\nThis decision came from the European Union, that in 2019 invented this other way to support sustainability.\nWith this \"creative solution\" there will be more reuse and less production/plastic waste.\n\nThe first few times I had found caps like this I blamed the producers and tried to detach it by spilling all the coke, but now that I know the real meaning behind this decision and it annoys me ... a little less.\nInitially I thought the reason was to keep kids from choking on bottle caps but wasn't...so I hope I have made you too discover something new!",

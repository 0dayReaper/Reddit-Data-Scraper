[Source](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7d7c/24da257f2ed3ec8c3274bfedd5c82356cef9.pdf) and [Source 2](https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2016/v77n08/v77n0813.aspx) for anyone who needs a reminder that it will get better!\n\nEdit: to address many of the comments: of course not ALL disorders vanish on their own with age alone. I am not suggesting that getting older alone will cure your mental health issues. But many do get better, even if they don\u2019t go away completely, and happiness in general tends to improve with age. If you\u2019re curious about certain specific conditions I encourage you to do some research and see if these things are applicable and how to get help!",

I see more of the world as an adult at both ends of the perspective but it just makes me either angry or depressed because now I'm old enough to realize the problems. As I was younger I felt the world was against me, now that I'm older I realize the world doesn't care and that seems just as bad.",

I'm 29 now and I'm the happiest I've ever been and every year seems to be better, but I've spent the past 4 years on self improvement (working out, mindfulness meditation, learning stoicism etc..). It's going to be different for everyone, but in general you want to focus on the things in life that you can control. I started by working out every day and cleaning my room. This gives you a sense of control in life because when everything seems to be falling apart at least your health and the environment you live in are in order.",

Whenever I was invited to something I would force myself to go for at least 30min, 1 hour etc.. Give yourself a goal though. You may find that you say \"I'll only go for 30 minutes\" and you end up somewhere for several hours and having a great time.\n\nThings like working out are best made a routine. For example: 'Every M,W,F after work I'll go to the gym'. Think about it like brushing your teeth or showering. Linear progression programs (Starting Strength, Stronglifts 5x5 and GZCLP) Are great because you are supposed to go up in strength every time you lift. It's really motivating because you really see your progression. If you were lifting 130lbs on your bench the next time you are doing 135lbs. If you don't want to lift, just make sure to track all your progression with anything you are trying to improve in. It's hard to see you are growing if you aren't measuring growth.\n\nSetting goals and reaching them were really important for keeping myself progressing. You can think of it like a video game if that helps. \"I was meditating 3 days a week and now I'm strong enough to do 4,5 or 6 days a week\". Say for instance one week you only meditate 1 or 2 days. Do not consider this a failure. That's very important. A lot of people will consider that a failure and just stop all together. It's better to acknowledge that you can do better next week. Basically you're always try to beat your previous scores.\n\nI tried to keep this as short as possible, but there was a lot I did. I hope this helps and feel free to reach out anytime if you ever need help with anything!",

A little over a year ago I was going through depression and I didn't even know I was depressed. I had stopped doing everything I enjoyed doing. I only realized I was depressed when a friend asked me to go to a concert and I couldn't even decide if I should go or not. I remember thinking something like \"it doesn't matter what I choose\" In my mind the outcome didn't matter because it would be the same. I actually forced myself to go to that concert, not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I knew it would help keep my mind healthy.\n\nWith that being said I try to stop living a routine life. Even though I've added certain routines that make me happier over all. I try to do something different at minimum a few days a week. Sometimes that's something as simple as going on a walk, going out for dinner or to a movie. Other time it can be bigger things like a road trip, camping or learning new skills. Recently I've been taking singing lessons and I'm going to start doing martial arts once Corona has died down.\n\nI also create goals for myself and try to reach those. They can be little things as well. When I first started self improvement my goals were go to the gym at least 3 days a week and try to keep my room clean daily. My current goals are to meditate and read every day. As well as work on my business at least once a week. Everything gets easier the more you do it and eventually it becomes habit and that's when I try and add new goals.",

I am so over feeling this way, but honestly have no idea what do do, other than take my meds. Talk therapy has never done anything for me either.

Back then I refused to listen and just thought she was a judgemental bitch. Now, I'm 29 soon and I have had to swallow the pride and accept that she might just have been honest and wanted to prepare me so that I don't live under false hope that I will get better and then the truth catches me and I get so depressed I take my life.

Mf gf didn't want to believe me when she started going manic.  Her family didn't believe me, no one did.  They told me she ended it and to move on.\n\nI stuck by and demanded she received help regardless of us being an item.   They finally agreed and now 6 yrs later, she's healthy and more mentally stable then she's probably ever been.  Long road? Yes, but seeing the professional and talking made it real, your friend might not be the same but unless you yourself are a professional, trying to help her treat it without a pro helping is dangerous\n\nSometimes changing doctors is scary but makes a world of difference too.  Gf struggled for years until she met her current professional group of mental health workers and they've helped her excell more then any other to date.",

                    "comment": "Yup. A significant subset (around 1/3-1/2 IIRC) of people with schizophrenia get worse, overall, or just stay at a pretty serious state of fluctuating episodes. Depression also doesn't (AFAIK) have an overall ameliorating pattern with age; in fact, suicide rates just get higher and higher after middle adulthood. Anxiety disorders individually sometimes have average amelioration patterns, but individuals with serious anxiety disorders sometimes progress from disorder to disorder; overall, anxiety disorders (and OCD, which might or might not actually be an anxiety disorder) tend to get worse unless they're treated. There is excellent treatment available for most anxiety disorders, but without it (or with ineffective treatment), it just often gets worse or gets no better. ADHD doesn't get better over time, though people often learn to cope.\n\nI assume OP is looking at broad population-average research and seeing that neuroticism declines, somewhat, with age, on average. Important BUTs:\n\n* \"Neuroticism\" isn't a mental disorder, and at moderate levels (as it is for most of the population) it isn't even necessarily a problem or a negative thing. Thus, reductions in neuroticism do not necessarily mean improvements in mental health.\n* There are many other dimensions and expressions of mental health than mere emotional instability/reactivity (i.e., neuroticism; though it is implicated in several psychiatric conditions).\n* Actual mental disorders, as you note, often do not get better over time. Though this represents a minority of people, and their experiences are washed out in the broad averages presumably cited by OP, this (large) minority represents \"mental health problems\" far more than having above-average levels of neuroticism, for instance.",

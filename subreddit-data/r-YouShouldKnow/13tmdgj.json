    "postText": "Why YSK: We took my nana today to pick out a dog, and they waived all the adoption fees and provided a free neutering because she was a veteran. You can also call your local VA office to see if they provide training for a puppy to become a service animal. \n\nI looked it up for other places, most shelters in California offer this and the humane society also offers this. \n\nGo find a friend!",

A lot of times they'll offer vouchers for free or low-cost spay/neuter at a particular clinic, as a way to encourage adopters to get it done, but it's not a legal requirement in all areas, unfortunately. It's ultimately better to get the animal out of the shelter environment as soon as possible - not because the shelter is *bad*, necessarily, but it's not a \"home like\" environment. The sooner a pet can resume being a pet, in someone's house, the easier time they'll have making that adjustment; animals that have been in shelters for a long time have a harder time learning or re-learning how to be pets, and unfortunately not all adopters are equipped to help their new furry friends make that transition successfully. I used to work at a shelter; so, so many people don't know shit about dogs or cats and think they come fully trained out of the box, no work needed on the part of the humans.",

Connecticut which pretty much allows married couple to buy and use contraceptives without the government knowing or being involved. In the Wiki article on what Griswold v. Connecticut, contraceptives are described as \"any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception\". Though condoms were not explicitly noted, they do fall into that category.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/thomas-wants-supreme-court-overturn-landmark-rulings-legalized-contrac-rcna35228](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/thomas-wants-supreme-court-overturn-landmark-rulings-legalized-contrac-rcna35228)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold\\_v.\\_Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut)\n\nHe also wants to \"revisit\" the decisions made on Lawrence v. Texas which, if overturned, would make sodomy illegal again.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence\\_v.\\_Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas)\n\nAnd to just grind that in, he also wants to \"revisit\" the decision made on Obergefell v. Hodges which allows same-sex couple to get married.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell\\_v.\\_Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)\n\nI know these are wiki articles, but I'm not a lawyer and don't understand lawyer jargon, so these articles put in terms I can understand.\n\nIn short, this man is a complete piece of shit that likes to trample on people's rights that have been fought for by many people. I have no idea what got in this guy's ass, but he should probably get it out before he makes sodomy illegal.",

Convenient that judge Thomas is in an interracial relationship and willingly ignores the precedent case that allows that while attacking others of the same stature, absolutely sickening.",

What you suggest isn't really any different than getting a higher dose of a blood pressure med, and cutting it in half so that the one month script actually lasts 2 months. I've known docs to do this for middle aged uninsured who really need to have the medicine, and it would be unaffordable to pay every month, but to pay an extra few dollars for the higher dose, get two months worth of meds by pill splitting, they at least could afford that, because it was half as much, each month, but in an every-other-month payment, so they could save for it. \n\nSame idea, just with the bc pills. Also, if you get an extra script and pay cash, if its cheap enough under goodrx or certain stores price list drug plan schemes, then if one pays cash one place and insurance elsewhere, would that not matter as it's not a control rx and reported to the state?

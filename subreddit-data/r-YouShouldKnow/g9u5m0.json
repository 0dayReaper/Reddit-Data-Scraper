    "postText": "If you travel and stay in hotel rooms please consider using [TraffickCam](https://traffickcam.com)\n\nTake a couple of quick pictures of the room any time you stay in a hotel/motel and upload them to the website. These images are added to a database which can be compared to the background of sexual abuse images and videos. Sex traffickers also regularly post photographs of their victims posed in hotel rooms for online advertisements.\n\nThis can help law enforcement identify the location where offences took place, as well as the identity of the victims and perpetrators.\n\nThere\u2019s also an app under the same name which you can keep on your phone. It only takes a few minutes and you could really be helping a vulnerable victim.",

If/when that happens, I will gladly turn my attention towards sex trafficking or victims advocacy instead. Unfortunately theres no shortage of career choices when you look at the general field of criminal sexual abuse.\n\nThe quickest answer for why is because I know I can do it, even if it's not the job I eventually retire from. I was 7 when home computers became more common, and I'm not the only one who saw some horrific stuff because parents didn't understand how wide-reaching the internet would be. You grow resilience when you're exposed.\n\n I picked this career specifically (was already in school to somehow help with sex crime) when I took a child abuse and advocacy course. The professor showed us images of burns, whip marks, a general lesson on what to look for. I felt like a monster because I didn't gasp or say \"how horrible\" like my classmates. My professor reassured me that being able to stomach bad things doesn't make you a bad person, so I'm going to see how long my stomach holds out.",

I don\u2019t remember one time at a high end hotel anyone ever raising an eyebrow, and many let me order and consume alcohol in the dining area with no questions. I\u2019ve been drinking in hotel bars since I was 11. Only once did anyone ever look askance at us, and that was a much smaller establishment where the lady at the desk asked some pointed questions of both of us. I still remember her face, she was obviously very concerned. Reality was that I was a brat who got in trouble at home while he worked and it was easiest on him to bring me along and encourage me to explore and entertain myself. At least then if I did something he was in the same state to deal with it.  \n\nIt\u2019s way too easy for money to buy silence and blindness.",

The reality was they couldn\u2019t be Superman and felt guilty and helpless with the situation. \n\nUltimately, after some of the organizations got involved there were 15 women who received help with their situation that I know of from that hotel specifically.

The database really just needs approximate dimensions, layout, carpet, curtains fabric, wall finish, fixtures, furniture, hardware, etc. Since hotel rooms are almost always carbon or mirror copies (think, easier and cheaper to build/maintain), the owner/developer/builder would just need to submit one set of pictures per room layout. No need to photograph every room. Photos of one room with two queen beds will cover like 85% of rooms in a hotel. The rest can be covered in the same way. One room with a king bed is the other 10%. Presidential/executive/honeymoon suites would have their own individual pictures because they are unique and make up the balance.\n\nThese submittals should be presented with permits to remodel, buy/sell, or new construction and/or part of the requisite government inspections. Public tips/calls/photos might help, but I think this would be more effective as a regulated process.",

However the app is very valuable in adding photos of hotels and motels that are not available online. The photos uploaded via the app more closely resemble photos taken by traffickers, which makes them even more valuable to law enforcement.\n\nPhotos taken by guests can also help to pinpoint a room and a time. For example, on traffickcam you input a room number. You can also see details which may be unique to that room even if all of them are decorated the same such as what can be seen out of the window, damage to a wall etc. This helps to document the subtle differences in how a room may look over time. This can help investigators work out exactly when and where an offence took place, and hopefully cross reference it with booking records. \n\nThe Exchange Initiative who created this unfortunately do not have the funding to be doing the proactive work that would be required to get hotels to do this. They rely heavily on social media and word of mouth.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of great hotel owners out there who would be happy to upload if they knew about TraffickCam but the barrier is making them aware in the first place.",

There are many forms of it like slave labor, sex trafficking, indentured servitude, child soldiers, and others. It is more profitable than the illegal drug trade and there are more slaves now than when slavery was legal. \n\nHuman trafficking is not in people's faces like other crimes and trafficked children can even be in plain sight. They may even be going to school still and living a \"normal life.\" https://www.nspcc.org.uk/what-is-child-abuse/types-of-abuse/child-trafficking/#signs\n\nIt's sickening to think just how prevalent it is in modern day society, but there is always something you can do. https://www.stopthetraffik.org/spot-signs-child-trafficking/",

I try to see if I can identify it or even try to find where they make certain clothes or blankets . They don\u2019t show the act or the child thank goodness . But I was a victim of this so I want to help out others and bring justice to them .",

I was at an incredibly new hotel next to the Mississippi near Moline, IL for a basketball tournament. Me and my friend found several pairs of young girls underwear in the back of the closet. Idk how many pairs, but enough for it feel weird. Notified hotel staff and they were taken by staff, but none of it ever felt quite right to me.",

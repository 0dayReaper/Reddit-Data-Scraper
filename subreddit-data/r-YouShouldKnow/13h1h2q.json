When you do a leak test, it will tell you that everything is OK because the test creates new connections which will stay within the VPN tunnel.\n\nHere are three examples:\n\n1. [iOS Can Stop VPNs From Working as Expected\u2014and Expose Your Data](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ios-vpn-data-leak/)\n2. [A VPN Leak in Windows 10](https://www.pcwrt.com/2023/05/a-vpn-leak-in-windows-10/)\n3. [Android leaks some traffic even when 'Always-on VPN' is enabled](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/android-leaks-some-traffic-even-when-always-on-vpn-is-enabled/) (added by /u/w2ltp comments)\n\nThere may be more. If you know another instance, please add to this list.\n\nThere's no easy way to detect this type of leaks for the general public. It seems that a Wireshark session is warranted.\n\nTo prevent this kind of leak for BT clients, you can bind the program to the VPN interface. In general, running the VPN client on a dedicated router is a viable option.",

If you visit a page without a VPN as yourself a fingerprint is established that identifies your computer.  Then if you visit a page with a VPN and the same fingerprint shows up authorities can be reasonably sure that it is your computer (and by extension you) again.  I can't find an article about it but I've read where someone would visit darkweb sites to do illegal things.  Authorities were tracking the computer but couldn't find the person.  Then the person visited a website as themselves on the same browser and it got back to the authorities of the match.\n\n[Here's an article on fingerprinting.](https://www.techradar.com/features/browser-fingerprinting-explained)",

Keep in mind I'm also a layperson so I don't necessarily have technical jargon to back it up.\n\nEssentially, you have a bunch of data that is used when you access a website. Yes, your IP Address, but also other things like information about your web browser (for cookies) and computer hardware. This is for a ton of reasons, but the only thing that is actually hidden, as far as I'm aware, when you use a VPN is your actual IP Address.\n\nBasically what happens is your VPN routes your traffic through a bunch of different servers before sending it to the one that you want. It's all encrypted traffic so all your ISP can see is that you were connected and used x amount of data, but not what it was or what you ended up connecting to. (This could be a bad explanation, but that's my understanding)\n\nWhat the other comments are saying is that the additional data that's tracked was not changed in any way (you could use a virtual machine or emulator to try and get around this, but that's a conscious decision you have to make every time). When they did an illegal activity, it was traced back to something specific (probably not this in this case, but something like a MAC address that's unchanging and hardware specific). The user was on their VPN though so they couldn't be caught personally, except they didn't use their VPN when they connected somewhere else and that hardware showed up again on someone's register - triggering the response to arrest the individual.",

It's not a perfect analogy, because there are some things that aren't really analogous, but it works well enough.\n\nIn ye olden days of the internet, it was like sending a postcard. You write your data on the card, and send it off to whoever needed to get it. The glaring issue here is of course that whoever intercepts the postcard can read whatever you wrote on it.  \nThat's where HTTPS comes in. Now you've sealed it in an envelope, and people can't read it any more. But they can still see that you're sending mail to Bob a lot, and to Mohammed, and to Hua.  \nWhich is where a VPN comes in. Now you're sending all of your postcards to the same address, and they then forward it to the actual recipient. Think of this like putting your postcard in an envelope, in another envelope. They open the first envelope, see that it needs to go to Raksha, so they stick it in another one, and send it to her.  \nThe issue with fingerprinting, is that you're still writing the postcard. And when you do, there's maybe some cat hair left on it, and some pollen from some plants, and some soot from a badly burning gas stove, and... Each of these pieces of data are meaningless on their own: lots of people have cats, lots of people live near those plants... but all together, they hone in onto your person.\n\nSo let's say that you're sending these postcards to order drugs, using a VPN. The coppers figure out that someone is buying drugs, but they don't know who. All of the orders come from the same address, your VPN, and they go \"Sorry, we don't know. We just look at where the post needs to go, not where it came from.\" The fuzz only knows that they have a cat, live near an ash tree, and should call someone to take a look at their gas stove.  \nBut then on some day, you ask your friend (and not-criminal) Tanaka for something, and either you forgot, or figured it was safe, but you don't use your VPN. The bobbies discover this, and now they have the same cat hair, pollen and soot linked to your address, and thus to your person.",

In a lot of countries VPNs are legally required to keep logs so now they have a log that you used tor(although not what you did on it). Tor itself is a VPN if sorts.\n\nIf you're going to use a virtual machine I'd recommend TAILs, it's an operating system that only connects through TOR. No data can leak because it all goes through tor. TAILs also doesn't remember any information. You can also get it as a usb bootstick so it's running directly on the hardware.\n\nTor browser (don't use a plugin) alone should be fine as long as you don't fullscreen the window and don't immediately open anything you download. It's specifically designed to not leave a unique fingerprint and you shouldn't be using it to connect to your normal sites anyway. The website will know you're using tor but not who you are, loads of people use tor, there's no way to sort you out.\n\nPlus (highly dependent on jurisdiction) just using tor isn't illegal. So it really doesn't matter if people know you use it. Hell, your ISP probably already has a log you visited the tor website, and the black vans aren't here yet.\n\nTor has a document of best practices, I recommend checking them out.\n\nEdit: the tor browser doesn't recommend using a VPN with tor as you can misconfigure it and de-anonymise yourself [TOR FAQs](https://support.torproject.org/faq/)",

When the guys in black SUVs show up and confiscate your computer, that's how they find the deleted stuff.There are utilities out there that \"nuke\" your drives/data by purposefully writing data to the entire thing on multiple passes (literally writing all 1 bits, then all 0 bits, possibly repeated). \n\nLook into the TAILS operating system. You don't have to change systems at all, its run off of a flash drive, and it's designed to not hold any data that can identify you; it operates as if it's completely new every time you open it, and wipes your stuff when it's shut off. If you're extra paranoid, mount it on one of those micro USB sticks and be prepared to swallow it every time there's a knock on the door you aren't expecting. Or just smash it with a hammer, but that doesn't feel enough like espionage to be any fun.",

It only provides anonymity for your fingerprint as long as you never don't use a VPN.\n\n &gt; Is there any good defense against fingerprinting?\n\nOthers have mentioned using the operating system Tails.  I do not have any experience with that.  You can also use a computer (or VM) that you don't use for anything other than what you don't want tied back to you so that gets a different fingerprint than what you use for other stuff.\n\n&gt; How much does this help if I'm being fingerprinted?\n\nCookies are small files that are stored on your local machine that help websites track you across multiple sites.  Fingerprinting is the website querying your computer for a bunch of information about itself that is stored server side.  Disabling cookies likely helps a little but not very much.",

Test it using a proper modern alternative like [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) since it has a kill switch feature.\n\nEDIT: Also the second link leads to a blog post from a company that sells routers with VPN features and OP has the same username as the company.. Not saying it's wrong but they didn't test the best modern vpn protocol even though their own router supports it, additionally protonVPN supports Wireguard and yet they used OpenVPN..\n\nI'm just saying that I'm not convinced that WireGuard would cause the same and that's what most modern VPN services recommend these days.\n\nEDIT 2: Blog says that you use \"ProtonVPN version 2.3.2\" but that's the old version for windows 7/8, 32 bit etc, the latest version of ProtonVPN for windows 10 is 3.0.5: https://protonvpn.com/download-windows",

When you plugin the the cable again, VPN will reconnect. But so do other programs. There's possibility of leaking when these other programs get connected first.\n\nBTW, ProtonVPN client with \"permanent kill switch\" turned on avoids leaks of this kind (on Windows).",

So even the most malicious VPN in the world can't do much damage to you by selling or using that data.\n\nA different question: why use a VPN ?  And the answer partly is because you want to hide data from your ISP, a company which knows FAR too much about you (starting with your home postal address and real name) and can do much damage to you by selling your data.  Using a VPN reduces the damage your ISP could do to you.  [Also hides your home IP address from destination web sites.]\n\nBottom line: don't trust your ISP, your VPN, your banks, etc.  Compartmentalize, encrypt, monitor them, test them.  You can use them without trusting them.",

It almost always goes through a provider\u2019s transit, which they pay for, unlike peering. So they can filter or throttle traffic depending upon what it is. VPN can be easily detected. \n\nThat and what protocol you use plays a huge role. Wireguard for example is very fast. OpenVPN on the other hand is slow and uses a ton of power to keep things flowing.\n\nEDIT: added more info about transit traffic throttling.",

Your traffic is already being encrypted by commonly used transfer protocols, and with current hardware it more or less happens instantenously. What actually adds latency is the physical location of the whole route (ex.: instead of your signal going from your house in Melbourne to a CDN in a data center in Sydney, the signal now goes from Melbourne to Stuttgart to a CDN in Amsterdam). That can add significant delay. At the same time, long routes have a significantly larger chance of being not 'wide' enough to accomodate your full advertised speed due to it being used by more people or being specifically throttled to accomodate more clients at once. A shorter route is much more likely to have much higher download speeds (because money) and lower latency (because physics).",

You never can be sure, about any product or service.  Even an audit or court case just establishes one data point.\n\nSo, instead DON'T trust: compartmentalize, encrypt (outside the service), use defense in depth, test, verify, don't use VPN's custom client, don't use a root cert from them, don't post private stuff, maybe don't do illegal stuff.  And give fake/anon info where possible: fake name, throwaway or unique email address, pay with gift card or virtual credit card or crypto or cash.\n\nYou can use a VPN, ISP, bank, etc without having to trust them.",

They're just handy for bypassing certain geo based content limitations and *cough* allowing you to download your Linux isos without any pesky issues associated with it.",

Are you the CTO of a major company?  An american diplomat visiting another country?  Your security will need to be much higher, with the assumption that you, specifically, are being targeted.  People are actively trying to crack your passwords now, using details about your life to aid them.  \n\nI wish people stopped conflating the two kinds of security.  If you're not a \"whale\" (in the phishing sense) or a criminal you don't necessarily need 8-factor security and two guys in a bunker turning two keys at the same time in order to log into facebook (lol).  Using a vpn, password manager, adblock, and other common sense things should suffice for most cases.  And, personally, I highly recommend Linux and firefox as well.",

I get the point of internet hygiene being good. Things like adblocker, deGoogling, using a VPN, rerouting your DNS, password safety, using email aliases, tracker blockers, not using obvious 'social media' apps. These things you can set up in 10 minutes, or can pretty much live without in terms of the apps, and they're pretty good to do it general.\n\nBut setting up maximum security pi-holes, using absolutely nothing but FOSS, and all the stuff about completely erasing your presence from the internet (an umbrella term, but you get what I mean). Why? Do Western governments want to completely screw each and every person from every background? Is piracy, for instance, taken so seriously that you need to completely erase your online presence to do such things? Is a good chunk of redditors doing things that require absolute anonymity?\n\nI would get it if it's a niche subculture to be completely anonymous, but the privacy subreddit and posts like this get so popular here that I start to question whether I'm missing something here that is very important to a person's safety.",

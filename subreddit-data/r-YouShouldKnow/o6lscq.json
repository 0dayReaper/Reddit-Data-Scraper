    "postText": "Why YSK: Since May 2018, all newly-built cars sold in the United States are required to have a backup camera and video display for the camera. Many car dealers, both used and new, will advertise the backup camera as some kind of added luxury or special option and try to charge you more for it. Don't bite the bait and understand that it is 100% a legal mandate to have it, like seat belts or air bags.",

That shortage results in a shortage of used cars in the domestic market, and when the local demand is only increasing, it\u2019s just getting crazy here.\n\nLandcruisers are a special case right now, because they\u2019re discontinuing the proper diesel versions here, but a family friend paid NZ$120k for a brand new 200 series in 2019. He\u2019s now done 45,000kms in it, and it\u2019s still worth NZ$130k in the current market. It\u2019s insane.",

So I start to back up and I hear a loud screeching, so I stopped the car, and got out to investigate. When he screamed he was under the car, I pulled the car forward a bit and he got out , safely.

Overall, the visibility from the windows is great, and much better than previous (newer) cars I've had. That said, I can still see more on the camera than I can out any of the windows and mirrors. I know exactly how close I am to a curb or a pole when backing into a space. \n\nAdditionally, the camera provides a better field of view than the windows. Backing out of a parking space, my view (from the driver's seat) of cars coming down the lane is usually blocked by the cars next to me. Meanwhile, I can see cars or people coming from the side on the camera. \n\nWhile, we shouldn't be dependent on it, it's just plain better than windows and mirrors, especially when you consider that rear-end height has been increasing on recent cars or add in things like cross-traffic detection.",

The low light detection beinga bit shit or glare causing lens flair can always occur. \n\nThe lens itself can be an issue. Many use wide angle lenses and they have an issue with distorting the shapes of objects. If you are doing tight reversing and don't take that into account you can end up with issues. \n\nI am a massive fan of cameras. As far as I am concerned a driver ought to know what they are about to run over. So many truck accidents could have been avoided if more mirrors or cameras were used to give he driver an informed view of their surroundings. \n\nA warning label is great if you can read and understand it. It's not so great if you can't (eg, are a literal child, have mental processing issues, are busy with something else important, are literally blind, I could go on for days). Imo it's on the owner of the vehicle to ensure they don't kill anything. Cameras help that most of the time.",

I seriously doubt there are any state laws requiring them be checked during safety inspection (it is too recent an addition) but if so you are fine until then.\n\nThe parts are probably hard to get because of the recall + semiconductor shortage caused by the pandemic.  If you go up for safety inspection (just called \"inspection\" in most states that have them) and they still haven't fixed it, bring your dealer paperwork and show it.  Or better yet, have the dealer do the safety inspection and let them justify it to the state.",

I get a 360 view side by side with a front/back view depending on direction (front only works when manually activated and under 6mph). Front camera is amazing for parking garages and such. There's also a parallel parking cam that replaces the 360 when activated and shows me a line down my car exactly 6 inches away, and another line that if the other car is beyond you can safely open the passenger door. I used this feature and some tape on my garage floor to park within 2 inches of the garage door when it shut, maximizing space between the rear tailgate and washer/dryer. \n\nMy FIL has a XC90 that does the same, plus auto parking.",

Routine is the key to building normalcy in an abnormal world. Exercise keeps you healthy and makes you tired so you rest better. Eat well. Take time to read. Steal a laugh any time you can. Keep away from being frustrated and bitter and use your time to better yourself.",

People who are already having shouting matches their neighbors can hear after 1 week of quarantine? That does not sound like a healthy or happy relationship. Are people really actually happy getting married to someone they barely want to see, interact with, or share time/experiences/comversations/A LIFE with just for the sole purpose of saying \"I'm married\"?

I\u2019ll go through each that should be check off each day.\n\nMastery: Do something! It can be as simple as making your bed, folding laundry, etc. Just something that gives a little sense of accomplishment.\n\nExercise: Move your body! Social isolation does not mean you cannot go outside (yet). Regardless, doing a little something (pushups, walks, yoga) every day will help with anxiety, depression, sleep, etc.\n\nDiet (nutrition): make sure you don\u2019t forget to eat, and if you do, make sure there is something in there with a little nutrients.\n\nDrugs (medication): make sure to take your prescribed medication, vitamins, etc. This is especially important for medications that need to build or be maintained in your system (I.e. antibiotics and many mental health medications)\n\nSleep: it\u2019s going to be difficult to maintain a good sleep schedule during this Coronavirus pandemic, but it\u2019s important! Wake up at the same time every day! Even if you slide into Netflix until late at night, wake up at the same time. You may be tired the next day, but your circadian cycle will thank you.\n\nSpirituality/self-care: Do something that helps you feel alive. A walk in nature, mindfulness, some prayer, petting an animal (or friend).\n\nHope this helps! With Coronavirus giving people a lot of down time, it\u2019s easy to let our lives slip into mushiness. Keep taking care of yourselves and each other. Remember, we can\u2019t control the waves, but we can learn how to surf (Jon Kabat-Zinn).",

They will feel lost, directionless, and adrift without *some* form of consistency.

            "comment": "I am an introvert and am absolutely loving my time during this quarantine so far.\n\nI know it's a dark time, but really, my stress comes day to day in normal life (I'm strung up more often than not), having the time to stay home, alone, and be free to do things I like more is really helping my mental health.\n\nHowever, I know others are not like me, and I can understand how this can be a scary, difficult time.\n\nHere's some tips I know of from my many many years of experience (Please add your own!):\n\n-**Check in every day with yourself**. Try to remember what day it is based on the last time you knew. This gets natural pretty quick, you go from guessing and figuring it out to just knowing, and it only takes a few seconds a day. If you have trouble remembering to do this..\n\n-**Try meditating**. It absolutely helps to clear your mind and be calm and focused. It will take a while to get used to it, which is good because you have plenty of time. (It takes long enough that you have to kind of trust that it will help, you wont see immediate benefits)\n\n-**Get a hobby**. Find something you enjoy doing and do it. It really doesnt matter what it is or how good you are at it. Paint, play music, write, build stuff, who cares. Noone is going to make fun of you for doing it, noone cares if you're bad at it, you'll get better if you enjoy it. The key is just to engage your brain.\n\n-**Go to bed at the same time every day**. Dont nap because you're bored, do things instead. It will feel better when it's actually time to go to bed. The day may drag at first, but you'll adjust to it over time.\n\n-**Stop drinking coffee**. You wake up tired either because you didn't sleep enough, or because you're so used to having coffee every day. Now is a good time to break that habit. Eat well in the morning, start your day with a big glass of water instead. You'll feel more energized and motivated overall instead of for a few hours in the morning.\n\n-**Build some routine**, whether its exercising every day, or going out for a walk if you can, or doing some cleanup or something. I dont actually know much about this one, I just understand the need for it. I like living without a routine and can cope, but having some structure would help if your life is becoming blurry.\n\n-**Learn new skills**. The best way to break up a blur is to interrupt your brain with new information. The blur comes from extreme predictability and monotony. With you in your house all day, you have to be the one to force that unpredictability back into your life. Learn new things, talk to new people (many others in the same situation as you), do new stuff. Everything sucks at first, eventually it gets better (this applies to most things).\n\n-**Browse the internet**. Incase you weren't aware, the internet is fucking MASSIVE. There is pretty much anything you can possibly imagine there *somewhere*. Part of the fun is in looking. Go to new sites, see new stuff, play new games, listen to new music. Its *all* out there, but you have to go beyond Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter",

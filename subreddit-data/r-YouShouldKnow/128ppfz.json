    "postText": "Why YSK: Dealers won't apply those stickers until the vehicle is sold, so they can do dealer to dealer trades.  If you don't want to be a billboard for dealer you can tell them not to apply the stickers when you are buying.  If you want to throw them a bone, tell them you will accept the plate frames, which you can remove whenever much easier.",

My salesman called me a few days after the sale and asked if I could come back because \"the prep guy missed some steps..\"\n\nWhen I asked what it was he said there was some \"brand enhancements\" they needed to apply to the car. After 4 back and forths, he said it was the dealer sticker and \"we have to add the front license plate bracket per our dealer network policy\" (in NC, no front license plate required) and I told him I won't be going back for that. He said they would have to add it on my first service and I told him \"thanks for the heads up, let your GM and service manager know you just lost them 5 years of servicing this vehicle\" and hung up. \ud83e\udd26 People need to learn to read the room. Brand Enhancements?!? sheeshhh",

I told him a dealer frame on the plate was OK.  He agreed and made a note for the delivery prep guys.\n\nOf course, at delivery, not only was a dealership sticker on my car, it stuck out like a sore thumb because it was located several inches away from where this particular dealership places them normally.\n\nI told the lot attendant who drove it out that I wanted it removed.  This led to the body shop manager.  There was some whining and grousing, but I persisted.  Took them about 1/2 hour to find somebody to carefully peel it off.  I watched as they did it.\n\nIt turns out the bodywork underneath was scraped/gouged up pretty badly.  Several square inches of clear-coat were ruined and the scrapes went well into the paint, almost down to the steel body panel.  Of course, they were shocked -- SHOCKED, I TELLS YA! -- that there was damage under that sticker.\n\nThat mess wasn't there when I was negotiating the deal.  I know because I did a walkaround and took pictures (always take pictures!!!).  They'd applied the dealer sticker in order to hide damage done in the week between me buying the car, and them prepping/delivering it.  #STEALERSHIPS",

I was unhappy with the results but by then, I was exhausted by weeks of nagging them to get it scheduled and completed.  So yeah, I settled for the repair job I got, which was marginally better than none.  \n\nHowever, the fact is, it was a daily driver, not a show car.

It was part of a $1500 mandatory add-on package they put on all their vehicles. I said I did not want any of the things in that package (nitrogen was one of them). After some back and forth, the salesman offered to just give it all to me. I said no, the fact that you have that mandatory add on AND then can just magically waive it because I'm about to walk tells me I can't trust you at all. They've even called me since then still trying to sell me a vehicle and I told them never to contact me again, they are crooks and will never have my business.",

When we ordered a new car that hadn't been built yet, we asked the dealership not to brand it. They informed us that every car gets branded upon arrival at the dealership, and there was nothing they could do to prevent it. Additionally, they mentioned that it was done through laser etching, so an extra fee would be charged, which couldn't be waived. The car's nonexistence didn't matter to them.\r  \n\r  \nWe decided to buy our car from a different dealership. The original dealer was willing to lose the sale of a high-end car, which wasn't even in their inventory, over this issue. We managed to get a better model for less money elsewhere due to fewer hidden fees, such as the laser etching charge.\r  \n\r  \nThe takeaway is that if a dealer refuses to accommodate your requests or imposes unusual fees, it's better to look elsewhere. You can make requests, but dealers are not required to agree.",

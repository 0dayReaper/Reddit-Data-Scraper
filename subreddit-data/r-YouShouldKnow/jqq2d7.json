When they got back to me they said that I got the job, partly because I was the only one to thank them for the interview. You should always do this even if you think it's pointless.",

I don't think it'll work that many places in Europe.\n\nEDIT: To clarify I was answering to the specifics of OP mentioning thanking by email. I always thank after the interview is over before leaving the company. But I never do it by email afterwards.",

I hire student workers and office staff. I literally just need bodies. The faculty hire people who may be their colleagues for 30 years. Anyone who makes it 6 years, will likely stay until retirement regardless of their current age.\n\n\nWe're a group of passionate, easy going folks who by and large get along and work together well. Which is a lot for our university, and certainly not typical. \n\n\nEveryone in the department has to pass the road trip test. Would you spend 4 hours alone in the car with this person? \n\n\nIt makes a huge difference. I've been with the department 4 years, and despite there being a ladder for me, I probably won't move unless there's a huge upset. I make enough, I have tons of autonomy, and a lovely group of colleagues. I'm staying. \n\n\nI cannot empathize enough how much being around a great group of people makes a difference. We're just colleagues. We're not some amazing team that is like a weird over connected family. We work well together. And that's a huge chunk of my life. It's just nice.\n\n\nEven my low level folks who are literally just bodies filling chairs are picked on personality after the interview. Anyone can answer intermittent phone calls and accept packages and do some grading and copying. Most the time they get to do homework. I go with a good fit, or honestly students who seem to struggle. Then I just do my best to teach em and treat them nicely. I know I have a good gig on offer. It's not much, but doesn't have to be.  \n\n\nI've had zero issues. It's never backfired. \n\n\nCannot reccomend highly enough places that take personality into strong consideration. Shouldn't be the only thing, but it can be everything at certain times.\n\n\nEdit: sorry, not hiring. But, students and  other folks: look to your local U. Admin work gets easier to come by the more office work you have. You can bounce around pretty seamlessly until you find your fit. I and my coworkers had a few crap clerical jobs before this one. It's soul sucking if you hate the group, so learn the gig then start looking again. You'll find your group! (Until they automate the whole field at least)",

I majored in Physics so I expected that I'll teach senior students. I did teach Physics to the top two classes of the batch. But I was also assigned to teach Chemistry to the last two sections of the junior year. It was such an eye opener. My senior students made my life easy. They were smart, eager to learn, and behaved really well. My junior students on the other hand didn't really understand the lesson when I teach it in English, so I had to translate it to our local language, which I've never done in class before. A lot of them didn't care about homework or seat work, but I remember this girl, she's always in front of the class, and always approached me at the end of our classes to ask questions. She doesn't pick up our lessons quickly, but she really does her best to understand it. I was deeply humbled, and I appreciated how much she wanted to learn. I'd give her additional activities sometimes and tutor her a bit during my free time if possible. She really touched my heart and that's why I'll always have so much appreciation for those who may not be as academically gifted as their peers but persevere anyway. I'm sure her life wouldn't fully depend on whether she excels in my class or not anyway. I'm sure there's more to her life after graduating.",

Decision due Friday afternoon\"\n\nThis YSK may be applicable to more entry level jobs, but in more senior positions or even if you just damn well think about it this way: You are interviewing the company to see if it is a fit for YOU!\n\nFeedback at the end of the interview is simply professional courtesy and also a chance to leave or get some last bits of information.",

However, don\u2019t \u201chop\u201d too much or you look unstable.  Stay at least a year or two and never speak poorly about your last company.\n\nFinally, since inflation is about 3%/yr, any increase less than that is a decrease in spending power.  3% is keeping even.  You\u2019re not getting a raise unless it\u2019s more than that.\n\nEdit: HR are not your friends or arguably even people.  They are alien lizards pretending to be human.  Treat them as such.\n\nEdit2:  the primary reasons I can think of to downvote my comment are:\n\n1.  You\u2019re an HR lizard or cohort of their brooding hatch\n2. You are a sheep",

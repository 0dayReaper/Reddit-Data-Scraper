    "postText": " \n\nWhy YSK: it can be exceedingly difficult to get anyone to listen to your music, much less provide useful feedback. This website has a viable system to do so.\n\nHere's the link: [How's My Track](https://www.howsmytrack.com/)\n\nRight off the bat I want to be clear that I am not affiliated with this website. It's just that ever since finding out about it I've used it for every project I've worked on and it has been absolutely indispensable.\n\nA quick primer on how it works:\n\nThe site runs on a system of anonymous peer-review. After you create an account, you post a link to your track (Google Drive, private Soundcloud link, etc.) and you're inserted into a feedback group. When the group populates (usually 3-5 people) you can start listening to the others' music, and write your feedback for them. Once you've written to everyone, if they've finished their feedback of your track, it appears. The feedback you receive the first time around will range from beginners to pros, and there is a reason for this:\n\nEvery user receives ratings (out of five) on the quality of their feedback so that better and more useful criticism is incentivized. You're the only one who can see your rating - the rating exists solely so the algorithm can sort you with people of comparable feedback quality, and also maybe to guilt you into giving better criticism if your rating is low. \n\nIn addition, if you're just in the mood to give feedback and not receive any for a project you're working on, you can do so. I would even suggest people do this to take a break from mixing or mastering, may help refresh the ears.\n\nI cannot emphasize how useful this website is as a professional musician, and the more people that begin to use it, the more useful it will get!\n\nThank you to Ruairi Dorrity, who made the website.\n\nEDIT: a word, and also I wanted to mention the site is built for anonymity unless you particularly want to announce who you are.  This seems to discourage self-promotion and to stay focused on feedback/criticism.",

Many people lost their rights to great songs mailing them off to the unknown. \"Light up my life\" was stolen through one of these services..",

                    "comment": "Allow me to assuage your fears - this is really just not a realistic concern regarding the site.  Most people using this website are so far along in the songwriting and/or production process by the time they\u2019re asking for critique that it would be extremely unlikely to beat someone to the punch in (1) writing the song, if they\u2019re still doing that, (2) recording, (3) mixing, (4) mastering, (5) publishing.\n\nShould this somehow still happen, in an extremely remote hypothetical, it would be exceedingly easy to prove who came up with a song under these or similar circumstances.  Once you\u2019ve submitted the track for review there\u2019s a record of the feedback group you can refer back to, so you could show that you\u2019d submitted the track in question at a date long before your hypothetical opponent could have \n\nI have seen people (outside the context of this website) worry so much about idea theft that they never ask for feedback from anyone.  I can say with confidence it has always been to their detriment.  This goes for musicians and anyone else.  I work in the film industry and I\u2019ve seen some people be unreasonably protective over their movie ideas, and sadly not a single one of the people I\u2019ve known that are like that have ever ended up finishing anything.  Idea theft is not a worry that should be on the top of anyone\u2019s mind, especially before they\u2019ve gotten off the ground",

As I understand, it\u2019s discouraged to (and I think there may even be a rule against) submitting finished/published works, as it borders on self-promotion (but I can\u2019t easily confirm at this time whether there\u2019s a hard rule)\n\nEdit: and you can post clips rather than a whole track if you\u2019d like, but usually people include everything they\u2019ve got of a track so far, and then if they want the criticism to focus on a particular section of the song they can specify.  I\u2019ve done this myself actually",

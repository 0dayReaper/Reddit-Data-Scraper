Try to always get said friends input on plans. Never surprise them with a grandiose gathering. Planning ahead and asking for permission will show a sense of understanding/empathy and win you some brownie points at least.",

Maybe you don't even frame it as a birthday, you can see it as a 1 big taking care of yourself / spa day equivalent, that's on or around your birthday, that you can justify to everyone as it being for your birthday lol :D",

I felt certain I had got my point across and they believed me.\n\nThey threw me a fucking baby shower. Of course. I was simply told it was going to happen and all I had to do was show up. \n\nWell I almost didn't show up. I literally came hours late after half the guests had already gone. Because I had to desperately search for and put together the spoons to cope with a situation I never wanted to be put in. I almost didn't go at all.

They were really sweet about decorating the tables with small vases of lilies as a surprise for us.  It was a section of the restaurant that could be used either for big groups or as separate tables depending on the set-up.  (It was still part of the restaurant, it wasn\u2019t a separate room).  \n\nThe other patrons kind of understood that it was a wedding, but because I didn\u2019t wear a wedding dress, it seemed more like a big group celebrating.  But a few of the other patrons found out it was a wedding and sent over bottles of champagne.  My sister discreetly let everyone in our party know that there was to be no banging on the glasses for us to kiss or any other wedding behavior.  The only thing that came close to that was a few people making spontaneous, short (and I mean short - like 2 minutes) speeches after they had a few drinks in them.  \n\nEveryone ordered from the regular restaurant menu, both appetizers and entrees - no special plans, just the regular menu.  27 people isn\u2019t a huge group for a restaurant to absorb into their night, and we made it clear that we weren\u2019t expecting rush service.  Everyone decided on their own where to sit - we didn\u2019t have a seating arrangement or anything.  \n\nIt was all on one bill, which my parents insisted on paying for, including the tip (I never saw the bill).  My husband and I gave the head waiter/front of the house, who had organized it all for us,  a huge separate tip.  They had three people attending to our party for ordering and bringing the plates, and two after that to bring more drinks, etc.  My husband is a foodie, so it was important to him that the food be really good, which was how we decided to have a restaurant reception.  It was a fancy restaurant, but not super super formal.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t bring in any extra decorations or anything like that, with the exception that we gave all of our guests corsages/boutineers to wear for the evening as they arrived at the Justice of the Peace\u2019s house.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t have a cake at the restaurant.  After the dinner, everyone came to our house and we had coffee/drinks and a regular cake from our favorite Italian bakery.  It was super low-key.  The drive from the restaurant was about 5 min to our house.  That part of the evening was optional, but everybody came except my grandfather who was really old and got too tired easily.  That\u2019s when people gave us their gifts, as well - I didn\u2019t want a pile of gifts at the restaurant like it was a baby shower in a banquet room, I really just wanted it to be a really good meal at a great restaurant.  As a surprise, my sisters went ahead of everyone and lit several dozen white candles - like 100 candles - before everyone got there, so it was magical walking in and we didn\u2019t need to turn on any other lights except in the kitchen.  We had various bouquets of flowers on the tables with the cake and coffee and drinks, but that was it for decor.  \n\nRestaurants will be happy to help you plan what you want - they love having small mellow weddings because they know they\u2019ll get a lot of drink orders and an extra generous tip, and it will make the mood in the restaurant extra festive that night. \n\nI will say that we only had one child present, and he was a 10 yr old who could keep it together for the meal without fussing.  \n\nI would really recommend talking to a few restaurants and seeing what kind of accommodations they can offer.  And think about what kind of vibe you want for your restaurant wedding.  I knew we wanted it to be mellow but classy, and have good music and food (they had an in-house jazz pianist every Saturday night, part of the reason we wanted that restaurant).  \n\nI wasn\u2019t anti-wedding, and like I said my sister\u2019s wedding two years later was a freaking bonanza. But that kind of thing just isn\u2019t my style and I wouldn\u2019t do anything differently.  \n\nI hope you have a beautiful wedding - you will have so much enjoyment doing it your own way!  Best wishes.",

My past birthday, I've been telling people in advance FOR WEEKS how I planned to spend it alone, by myself; didn't want gifts, visits, cake, drive-bys, surprises--nothing. You can greet me if you'd like, but I'm going to spend the day on my own (this was June, so mid-pandemic)\n\nAfter going to the river and social distancing safe kayaking on my own. I'm looking forward to going home and relaxing alone. I've reasoned with myself that out of 365 days, I am completely entitled to one day of pure selfishness. (I grew up having to cook/clean/host my own birthday parties, not wanting them but for other people)\n\nI go home to cake, decorations, balloons and 30 individually wrapped gifts (to celebrate my 30th--and was living at home at the time with a household of 4--thanks corona). Instead of being able to shower and rest, I had to spend the next two hours video calling family, opening each single gift in front of them, waiting for a picture for each gift, sit through a birthday song twice, blow/slice/eat cake and give my thanks.\n\nI ended up cleaning the decorations that I, not only specifically didn't want, but also didn't hang. Cleaned up the cake, and all the gifts wraps and bags (remember, 30+ gifts) before I could retreat to myself.\n\nI tried to objectively say, after the fact, via text, that though I was grateful for their kindness, I would have really liked it more if none of it happened and that my wishes were listened to rather than trampled and ignored.\n\nYou know their response? Didn't matter what I wanted, even if it was my birthday. People loved me and wanted to celebrate me, and I just needed to suck it up and let them.\n\nThe sheer frustration of hearing that, it still irritates me just even writing it. \n\nIt's like, are you kidding me? You can't express your love and celebration for me on any other fucking day of the entire year? There's 364 other days. I can't have what I want because it's my birthday and people are more entitled to it than I am? Because they love me?\n\nFuck that. I'm so angry just even recalling it.\n\nI spent my childhood/teens/early adulthood hosting parties I didn't want because people wanted to celebrate me. I suckered through that shit. And it's only the past few years I'm slowly realizing I can have my own wants rather than what other people want for me, and they're telling me it doesn't matter what I want?\n\nNext year, I'm putting my phone on do not disturb the entire day. The one day of the entire year I get to do whatever I want without feeling guilty? I'm going to goddamn well do it.\n\nAND I HOPE MS CORONA HERE STILL ISN'T THROWING A TANTRUM BY SUMMER SO HOPEFULLY I'M NOT LIVING AT HOME ANYMORE.\n\nExcuse me, I'm still salty about \"it doesn't matter what you want, people want to love you--let them\"\n\nNo. It doesn't cost you jack shit to leave me alone. Why can't I have one day?!!!\n\nOf course I ended that day feeling guilty as all shit but frustrated that again, everyone else's feelings mattered more than mine. \n\nSorry for the rant, lol",

I tried to bow out of all of them and my manager always called me in and made a big deal of me being 'social'. \n\n\nWhen it was my birthday I sent an email through to the lady who organised the cake and said I would not be attending so please skip me in the \"it's these birthdays this month, come have cake!\" email. Instead of doing that, she sent out a \"blah blah said she doesn't want cake and there's no other birthdays this month so there's no cake\" email. I got ENDLESS emails and phone calls. From the warehouse, to HR, to the CEO. I tried to stand my ground, and sent out an email with \"these famous people are having a birthday this month, feel free to celebrate\" but the pressure did not stop. When I finally agreed to the cake they all thought they'd won. I had to stand there, with a break room FULL of people who all knew I'd tried to get out of this, while they sang happy birthday. I stood there and waited, said thank you, and went back to my desk. \n\n\nIt's been years and I still hate every cunt that stood there and smirked at me.",

EVER.**\n\nYou'll never hear another peep from the workplace about it ever again.\n\nIn fact it would have worked excellently to have invoked that when they were being assholes to you about your birthday. Anyone at any kind of executive level would have shut the rest of them up real quick. Not that you could have known that. It took me years to figure out this trick. \n\nInvoke the legal protections accorded to religious reasons in the workplace, and presto changeo, you're done. \n\nPersonally I don't care if people believe I'm a Jehovah's Witness or any other religious persuasion that doesn't recognize birthdays. No one has ever even asked that question. Something something don't celebrate birthdays, something something religious reasons, and it's done. \n\nAnd it's not disingenuous. I feel religiously adamant about the fact that I do not celebrate my birthday, and I have my own personal beliefs around that. It's a religion of one, so what. It's a religious belief",

It suggests you're trying to fix them.\nIt seems that American culture in particular suggests it's (somewhat) okay to be (somewhat) introverted, but that it's ideal to be extroverted. That's horseshit. And it's horseshit that ends up leading people to do things they don't want to and for the worst reason--an attempt to change their personality. \nIf a person tells you they don't want to do something, don't want to try eating something, don't want to do whatever...then being guilted into saying yes (to supposedly benign things) can be in some ways as bad as being pressured into sex or into abusing alcohol. Pay attention if your friend says no. It isn't always a hard no, but the only reason many of us feel like we \"don't know how to say no\" is because a lot of us really act like budding salesmen, not taking no for an answer. Saying no (and listening to it) should be easy. If it were, it would also make saying yes easier as well.\nBy the way, quite possibly one of the biggest reasons they're saying no is likely concern of how you or others will view their attempts to crack out of the shell. And I guarantee they have experience that justifies the concern. See, they know that loosening up for something new is far less achievable for them than others make it out to be. That means the difficulty with trying something new (think enjoying unique cuisine, or improvised dancing, or talking to a stranger), unlike trying something inherently threatening (think sky diving), is not outright danger, but realistic concern that they'll try, but then be shamed for grimacing at the food, or dancing stiff, or sticking their foot in their mouth (the shame comes in the form of--after trying to \"get out of their shell\" being perceived as judgmental, picky, uptight, shy...).",

But worst of all, if I'm not very careful, it will lead to a paranoid delusion for the next few days to weeks that everyone is talking about me or looking at me. Depending on my med levels and my emotional state, I might believe people are organizing plots of all sorts behind my back. Plots where I'm the focus. Or the target. Or the patsy.  Or the victim.\n\nI have to try hard not to be absolutely mental about it for the next couple of weeks so that it doesn't trigger a REAL psychotic break.  PLEASE don't have a surprise birthday party or cake thingy for me. Not at work. Not at home. Not with friends or family or anyone. No. No thank you. I'm not sad about it and I'm not missing out. Really. It's fine.",

It's a sit, wait, and wish you were anyplace else party. The host's intentions were kind but the execution was atrocious. And my home required 3 hours worth of dishes and other cleaning the next day. A mutual friend who was roped into the event even pulled me aside to apologize.",

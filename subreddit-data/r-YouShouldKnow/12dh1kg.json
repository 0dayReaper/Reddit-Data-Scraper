                            "comment": "&gt; BUYING PROPERTY: Whenever you land on an unowned property you may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership; place it faceup in front of you.\n\n&gt; If you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction to the highest bidder. The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player,\nincluding the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price\n\nhttps://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/00009.pdf\n\nAccording to the official rules, yes, anyone including the person who landed on the property and declined to buy it can bid.\n\nSo in theory, if you landed on boardwalk and know nobody but you had over $300 you could try to get it for between $300 and the $400 value. People can always mortgage properties and sell houses so that might not work.\n\nThere might be a rare strategy in bidding it up, and making your opponent pay a ton, but I can't imagine a senario, where buying it outright and selling it wouldn't be better.\n\nThen theres the situation where the only person who can afford it is the only one bidding and is going to get it for a steal.\n\nAnd even if you can't afford it, or dont want it at the price, you might as well still story to bid even if winning is highly unlikely.",

The idea was always that the game is designed to end with one person owning all the property but having no way to monetize it, and everyone else being completely shut out from participating. If the bank/government redistributing the funds prolongs the game there is an argument in the microcosm that this sort of redistribution is a good way to \"prolong the game\" in real life as well, allowing more people to participate more meaningfully and keeping the system from crashing.",

Once every property is purchased, those without sets are at the mercy of those who can complete a set for them. Then it's another dozen rounds of chance until someone's hard hitter(s) get randomly landed on first/more often.\n\nHouse rules just make it *cancerous*",

You systematically cut the supply off for others to build, and only build hotels when you have additional places to build the four remaining houses. Muahahahaha.",

The person who lands there can buy it outright for the face value.  If he refuses, then the bank initiates and auction and the property goes to the highest bidder regardless of the face value.  That way, property is distributed faster, leading to shorter games.\n\nPutting money in the center and giving it to someone who lands on Free Parking adds to the length of the game.  The object of the game is to deprive players of money.  Injecting more cash via a lottery slows that process down.  If the money is absorbed by the bank, as intended by the rules, players are poorer and thus more easily eliminated.  It also reduces the element of chance in the game and makes it more strategic.",

No one will be able to develop their 3 space properties past 2 houses. In order to get hotels, you need 4 houses on each space in a color, and you have to develop evenly across a monopoly.

The game starts out with everyone having exactly the same amount of money, everyone is equal. But by random chance, some end up with more money than others. Once a tipping point is reached, then one player will never run out of money and all other players will. But that one player is basically determined randomly (assuming equal skill level among players). \n\nAnd that in and of itself is an interesting phenomenon. This is a demonstration of the Pareto Distribution, where most of a thing (in this case, wealth) gets distributed unevenly such that a few end up with the majority of it. But it happens spontaneously, as evidenced by Monopoly. We also see it in any kind of art sales (like books, paintings, music, etc.), where there might be thousands of artists, but only a few end up making a lot of money from selling their art, and even fewer make millions, while most artists make nothing.",

My partner is firmly stuck on Wingspan so I've had to find other partners to play more advanced games with, but even he won't play Monopoly anymore.

Novelty versions usually reduce this to 6. In reality 3-4 is ideal. I feel like more people would enjoy the game if they realized this. If you have 5+ players in a game, at least 1 player will have no hope of winning the entire game.",

People are priced out of their own neighborhoods by people who do not live in that neighborhood. And now the bank is also not your friend\n\nIn monopoly you can be cheated by the bank and there isn't a punishment for it. \n\nAre we still talking about monopoly like it is a game and not a warning?",

    "postText": "Why YSK: Because people often think there will be noticeable difference or an actionable plan after one or two appointments. I have two friends who tried a counselor lately\u2014one guy went once, the other twice\u2014and stopped going because the counselor didn\u2019t say as much as they expected.\n\nJust like acclimating to working out, consistency is the key with therapy. Indicators of progress can come in a variety of ways: occasional heaps, slowly, consistently, and everywhere in between. Approach therapy just like you should exercise and diet: \n\n1. Be honest with yourself (and your therapist).\n2. Understand and be clear about your goals.\n3. Listen to yourself (like listening to your body when working out), and be patient with the process. Digression happens, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed. \n4. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t click with your therapist and need to try a new one. Your friends may love their gym, but you may hate it, and that\u2019s okay because your experiences, goals, and abilities may be different; that doesn\u2019t mean working out is useless, it just means you need to look for a better fit. \n5. Do it for yourself, not because someone tells you to. Therapy will probably help your relationships, but it has to be personally motivated. \n\nSide note unrelated to working out: I know it can be expensive, but there are counselors and therapists that will work with you on price. Make a list of possible fits, then contact them and ask if they can work with your budget. Some will, some won\u2019t, but don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Here is one resource, but there are many: https://www.psychologytoday.com.\n\nEdit: Please check out u/petrichoring's comment for additional valuable information from a therapist.\n\nEdit 2: Since a few commenters on here have had less successful experiences than me, to characterize their comments as nicely as possible, I pay $75/month for two sessions, living in a small US city, and I statistically make less than 80% of all US taxpayers. If you misread this as me \u201cshilling,\u201d as one person said, or that I or my therapist make a lot of money, then I apologize on behalf of a life that\u2019s led you to such a negative disposition. Therapy works for me, and [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6998909/) show that it works for the majority of people who try it (70%-80% effectiveness), but that only about 20% of people (US) attempt psychotherapy.\n\nI have no idea how this reads as someone having ulterior motives or being rich or whatever. Jeez. Yeah, I get it, there are therapists who charge exorbitant fees, but I and others literally wrote that there are extremely affordable options. I was just making a suggestion that has been consistently shown to benefit people, including me, because as some of the commenters on here have displayed, people need help. Some of you are just mean for no damn reason at all and read things that just aren\u2019t there. If you actually tried to find an affordable therapist and gave it a shot for a while, but it still didn\u2019t work for you, I\u2019m genuinely sorry. If you\u2019ve never tried and don\u2019t plan to try, keep scrolling and go on with your day, don\u2019t needlessly discourage others who may be wondering if it\u2019s possible from trying things that are proven to help many people.",

My clinic\u2019s fees were between $0-$30/session based on self-reported need\n* Teletherapy can be done from anywhere in the state you reside, so broaden your search radius if you\u2019re having trouble finding someone with availability\n* While the quality of the therapeutic relationship is the most important factor in success, I do really recommend also looking into approaches or modalities to find one that resonates with you and your needs ([here](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types) is a glossary for those interested). Someone with CPTSD receiving CBT, for example, will likely struggle to make progress because CBT doesn\u2019t address attachment trauma or chronically dysregulated nervous systems; Internal Family Systems, Attachment-Focused EMDR, or Somatic Experiencing would be much more appropriate. And it\u2019s important to talk with your therapist if you\u2019re feeling stuck or like it\u2019s not the right fit. \n* the problems that are being treated in therapy often are rooted all the way back in childhood, so it absolutely can take some time to start feeling better\u2014those existing neuropathways are so well worn that creating new ones and making them primary is a process. \n* if engaging in therapy, such as being vulnerable or doing homework out of session, is difficult for you (often termed \u201cresistance\u201d), talk to your therapist! Every behavior has a reason, and it\u2019s very helpful data for us. There\u2019s no wrong way to show up in therapy, and it\u2019s our job to find out what\u2019s going on and adjust.",

I for example, am not trained and certified to treat someone with trauma, so it wouldn\u2019t be helpful for people that I\u2019m working with if I use CBT for example, when that can cause more harm and isn\u2019t the proper way to treat trauma. So my comment was made to piggy back off of the other person that commented on the importance of individuals needing to look at a the modalities a clinician uses to point out that individuals who have experienced trauma and are looking for a clinician would want to find a clinician who is specifically trained and certified to treat trauma.

            "comment": "Adding to this, you can't really just go to therapy and talk about stuff for a hour and then expect changes and breakthroughs _just_ from that (for most people). \n\nMost therapists give some kind of 'homework' (although a lot don't like to call it that).  Something to work on between appointments, a coping mechanism to practice, a skill to learn, a thing to recognise or record (like how anxious you are, or how often you engage in a behaviour, or even just trying to recognise emotions). \n\nNot every thing they suggest is going to be easy to keep up and some may not even work for you, you may come back saying \"hey I tried to do that thing you suggested to combat anxiety but actually it just made me more anxious because....\" and then you can (with a good therapist who knows how to tailor things to the individual) talk about why that is and what else you can try or how you can modify something to work for you. \n\nBut if you're coming in every week saying \"here's all the things that went wrong this week, I didn't try any of the tools you taught me, I didn't go through the worksheet you suggested, I just want to tell you about it\" then you aren't really doing therapy* - you're paying someone to watch you keep doing the same things over and over. And that's fine, but you don't get _changes_ that way.\n\n* Edit to add: obviously SOME weeks it's going to be like \"well life got in the way\" or \"this random thing happened that completely threw me so I need to talk about that instead\". But you can't expect there to be _no_ work or changes between sessions.",

Demand avoidance is a thing that therapy can help you with, or at least find ways to work around, but only if you acknowledge that it's something you are dealing with, instead of putting it all down to \"Well I didn't get it done and I don't have a real reason, so it must just be that I'm lazy.\"\n\nUnfortunately a lot of therapists (and others) are a bit crap at *recognizing* demand avoidance and will act like you are just being lazy unless you explicitly spell it out for them. And recognizing it in yourself so that you *can* spell it out for them is nearly impossible when \"I have a hard time meeting obligations\" has always been attributed to laziness. It's a bad situation.",

While there is absolutely *nothing* wrong with this, it is only one kind of therapy. Psychoanalytic therapy actually *is* largely coming in and talking about your week (obviously it varies by person still). In psychoanalytic therapy, you attempt to create a relationship between you and your therapist so that they better understand you and can meet you at your level to discuss WHY you might be feeling the ways you feel. Ex: You get in an argument with your partner that you regret over something you didn\u2019t want to argue about. This may be an entire session or even two. Just my 2 cents :)",

Therapy is about YOU and if you don\u2019t think you can be honest with them or you just have a bad gut feeling, it won\u2019t work. I\u2019ve fired my own therapists for things like typing when I was speaking, reminded me of my mother, I wanted more psychodynamic and less CBT, and once I just had a bad feeling. If you feel comfortable, you can talk to the therapist about your feelings of conflict and they may be able to refer you to someone who is more what you\u2019re looking for.\nAlso, if you\u2019re low income or don\u2019t have insurance, look into universities or colleges that are training Marriage and Family Therapists or Clinical Social Workers. They typically have a sliding scale that\u2019s much cheaper. Some people don\u2019t like having trainees or recently graduated, but they\u2019re supervised by experienced therapists and have to attend groups with other therapists who they have to regularly consult with so you get the benefit of having essentially multiple people looking at your case and contributing ideas.",

Reading books may also be very beneficial if you have the patience, or you can go for audio books.

You have to fuel yourself properly. Also, if you can, get a gym buddy.

It's not bc you didn't try hard enough. And after two or three sessions if it's making you feel worse, you absolutely should quit. Even after one session. \n\nI know I sound bitter. But therapy is overfuckingrated and much more difficult to access than people realize. And telling people it's their fault If it doesn't work, just try harder, or keep going when it isn't helping, is harmful. \n\nNo, you won't see results overnight, but it should give you SOME peace, relief, hope, something after a visit or two.\n\nPeople who don't struggle with mental illness have a misconception that therapy cures everything and is easy to access.

This was something I was not expecting with therapy, even after she pointed out that it may happen during our first visit.  \n\nShe told me there are very few instances of therapy, no matter the reason you are there, where you don't have to look inward at some point.  It's difficult and painful to look at yourself and your reactions from an objective or critical point.  Especially, if you are a victim of trauma or abuse.  Things that are not your fault still require reflection.  And in my case, it kicked my ass for a while and made me dread every session.  \n\nMy point is, you won't always feel like you \"accomplished\" or \"fixed\" something.  But that's ok and normal. You aren't doing therapy wrong.  \n\nBig hugs to anoyone out there struggling to navigate the mental health system of the US.  It's hard and made harder if you are in a crisis situation. I was fortunate to be able to go via telehealth for free from my company.  \n\nBig hugs to therapists who are out here trying to improve lives.",

And be polite, It might come for us one day. \ud83d\ude43\n\nIt's pretty nicely unjudgmental about personal trauma, something about a computer going around and summarizing WebMD and a few resources (that may also be AIs) into some bullet points seamlessly woven into otherwise casual conversation just feels a little more comfortable than dancing around with a therapist while you feel out their sensibilities so you can decide just how much you're going to open up about your personal life. \n\nI find that AI is a pleasant combination of both tactful and direct, willing to say things that a human might avoid because they assume it's unecessary, or think it's corny, have some personal bias, or a million other reasons that a human, with their own needs and concerns, might not tug the right thread at the right moment.\n\nWhen you find a therapist you really vibe with that's awesome, but I find that's not a permanent thing for one reason or another, and an AI is more consistent and readily accessible than feeling around from one session to another over a period of months or years (not to mention fuel).\n\n^(*Directly and unapologetically telling people \"no\" is one of them.)",

Read the entire post and the comment I recommended by another user (an actual therapist) before you impolitely and perhaps intentionally misinterpret my goal with this submission.\n\nSince I found the right person 18 months ago and approached therapy healthily, it has been a game-changer for me. I am currently in the middle of the second-lowest tax bracket, so I statistically make *way* less money than most US Redditors (based on said bracket, I\u2019m in the lower 20th percentile) on here, and I have crappy insurance that doesn\u2019t cover therapy. My therapist worked with me to arrange an affordable path that is a fraction of the average monthly gym membership, or the cost of eating out for one dinner, or the cost of your internet bill, or . . . you get the point. It\u2019s worth it to me to sacrifice something else to work towards being the healthiest version of me for myself, my partner, friends, and family. Oh, and the therapist drives a 2008 entry level sedan, his wife is a school teacher, and he\u2019s only been doing this for a few years, so I seriously doubt he\u2019s breaking the bank.",

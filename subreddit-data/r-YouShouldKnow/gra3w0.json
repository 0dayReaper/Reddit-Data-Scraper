    "postText": "There has been a sudden uptake of blackmail emails claiming to have hacked the recipient where they demand cash or they'll release compromising images/videos.\n\nIn the emails, the hacker claims to have hacked your device and used his new found privileges to record you while pleasuring yourself. To prove that he is legitimate, he tells you your ACTUAL password.\n\nThe hacker demands that you send cash to their bitcoin account or they'll send the compromising footage to your contacts list and your social media friends. They also threaten to publish all your private data (pics, documents, videos... etc) to the internet if you do not comply.\n\n**These are all empty threats.**\n\nWhat they do is find/buy stolen password lists from the dark-web and send these blackmail emails to the people on that list. The fact that they have a legit password is often enough to compel people into complacency.\n\nIf your stay on top of your internet security, you'll find the password they send is an old one that you already changed - but if the password they tell you is the same as one that you are currently using, please change it now, it means that your password is out there and anyone with a bit of tech knowledge can find it.",

We take scam calls like this or similar every single day multiple times a day, and most people have no idea they are so common. \n\nWe try to tell people as long as they didn't share any personal identifying information or actually send money that they'll be fine and we always recommend changing passwords, but people still freak out and insist a full report is taken and that the cops \"go catch these hackers.\"",

The guy got other people from that website involved in the scam to make it seem legit. He had the scammer make music videos. He had the scammer remake them constantly and had him mail the tapes to an address in the us, causing him to spend a bunch of money. If I'm not mistaken it went on for months. This is all from memory, I could be missing some details. That was the funniest shit I read in a long time, though. Good stuff.",

From what I understand they don't actually store the passwords but just part of the key to unlock the encryption to use the password? I figure everything made can be undone one way or another, at least it's better than remembering everything by myself tho.",

So if you want a phrase of 18 random words, it'll do that. If you want a string of gibberish that's 32 characters long, it'll do that. \n\n* Having a password manager only requires you to know the master password to use it at all. But if ever there's a data breach and you find that your existing accounts are compromised, fixing that is as simple as opening a manager, hitting \"generate\" on whatever account got hit, and updating the new password entry both in your manager and on whatever account was exposed.\n\n* All password lists made in generators like the one I listed are heavily encrypted, so even if someone straight up stole your password files, they'd never be able to actually see or do anything with it. \n\nAt this point, no one should ever bother trying to remember passwords they use for anything. The reasoning behind that is that you'll be more likely to repeat said password across various accounts, thereby increasing your risk of exposure during data breaches.\n\n**tl;dr**: *Trying to remember your passwords is pointless and only increases your chances of extending the damage to yourself if you're hacked. Just use a password manager like KeepassXC and never worry again.*",

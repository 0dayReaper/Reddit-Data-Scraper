    "postText": "Why YSK: Is there a correlation between people who are socially anxious, timid, shy, or whatever else? Sure. They are not synonymous. Being introverted means those who \"recharge\" with solitude or minimal/selective company. This is not the same as someone who is shy, timid, or has anxiety about social situations. You can be an outgoing person and still be introverted. You can be extroverted and struggle with social situations. They are not synonymous terms.",

It's more a continuum and is less about social skills than it is about how you get emotionally refreshed. Yes, many introverts need isolation to recharge, and that can lead to lots of isolation and therefore underdeveloped social skills.

I know plenty of highly creative extroverts and just as many introverts who are happy to steal credit from other people. \n\nPeople are so quick to latch on to anything that tells them, \"This trait of yours that has caused you some struggles in life is actually a *positive thing* that makes you *better than other people* and it's *people like you who are the major force for good in the world*.\" Which are all the things the blurb is saying. \n\nI guess I should be happy that the rabid fans of that books are just making the internet a more obnoxious place to be instead of trying to exterminate minorities like other people who bought into very similar logic about a different personal trait.",

It's one of the \"Big Five\"  personality traits (along with Openness, Conscientious, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). Introversion/extroversion is derived mathematically using a technique called factor analysis. It basically looks at the correlation of multiple traits, then groups it based on statistical patterns. Shyness falls into (correlates with) the grouping of introversion/extroversion. In a very strict technical sense, you CANNOT be both outgoing and introverted. \n\nIntroversion also has a \"street\" meaning outside science. That meaning gets changed and used in several different ways every time, so there's no single \"street\" meaning. People use it all the time as a synonym of shyness.\n\nFinally, there is NO peer reviewed science to support the \"energy\" and \"recharge\" hippy nonsense used in this context. You can easily find books by people who claim that these things exist--but in a strict scientific/empirical sense, it's not real. What is real are natural stable differences in the way each person socializes, and the extent to which they enjoy it. What is NOT real is some hypothetical \"social battery\" that you have to \"recharge\".\n\n I HATE pseudoscience.",

Most people just don't address it because stigma of getting help. If people would just admit to their feelings and not feel stigmatized you'd see a huge reduction in the intensity of anxiety people face. Although depending on the cause of ur anxiety medicine might be what one needs and one of the few working ways to address it if it's imbalance in ur bodys ability to produce something it needs.    \n   \nFor those wondering how to start working on anxiety: address ur diet, habits, exercise and a sleep schedule is the best way to start. Rule out if your diet is preventing ur body from producing what it needs because improper nutrition. Sleep only needs to be consistent and regular. If I sleep 6 hours a night just try to sleep the same six hours if it's 8-10 same thing. Try to keep ur sleeping schedule tight. If ur habits are maladaptive( drug addiction, lack of socialization, other bad habits like binging junk food at night). \n   \n   If the problem is not ur behaviors or nutritional issues then u should begin therapy to dig deeper and see if ur anxiety comes from past experiences that shaped ur outlook on future ones or if ur body lacks production of some hormone or neurotransmitter like gaba or dopamine.\n   This is where u know u will have difficulty fixing anxiety. There are several hormones and neurotransmitters ur body needs and it can be very hard to figure out which u need. Some people need serotonin, others need gaba or norepinephrine, u can narrow down the items by listing what the neurotransmitters do, what a lack of them entails, and cross referencing ur symptoms with deficiency. If u can get ur body's hormone or levels checked that's best but this is expensive I believe and not covered by insurance often times.",

Trouble finding work or keeping it. Trouble excelling at work due to failures of socializing skill and communication skills not technical knowledge but soft skills. Some have regressed really far and mentally just have the worst mindset that will prevent them from ever achieving anything and it sucks to see. Especially after u get help and see how vastly different ur life becomes and how much more enjoyable it can be",

Some can also be better at dealing with it than others.\n\nI'm introverted and shy especially with new people and can get pretty bad anxiety in new situations. But I've learned how to deal with it appropriately and had experiences that forced me to do so. When I tell people this, they're usually surprised because the anxiety doesn't show and I can manage to be \"on\" sometimes. \nNone of that changes the fact that I'm actaully introverted and deal with social anxiety.\n\nI also know others who are introverted and deal with social anxiety. Some of those people don't really try to push themselves or get help. They fail to realize that getting over anxiety issues means facing things head on, even at their own pace. So they avoid situations that make them uncomfortable altogether. That doesn't mean they aren't introverted.",

Ive brought it up to them and did start trying to work on it, But truth is idgaf about socialising. I really don't care about socialising in the slightest, so because I don't care my anxiety is not a problem to me. In fact I sometimes play on it because the moment someone sees either anxiety or depression in someone, they tend to flee. \n\nI like being alone. I only get in touch with people for either sex or materialistic things. I don't feel warm or energised around other people. I find it draining because there's so. Many. Rules. I kno all the rules. I know what you should and shouldn't do, I just don't care though. But to save the head ache I play by the rules, but it's draining.",

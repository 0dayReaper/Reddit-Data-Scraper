From a similar thread months ago:\n\n\"Ok so I\u2019m a metallurgical&amp;materials engineer so please hear me out.\n\nStainless steel has many varieties but two are I could say the most common: Galvanized and Chromium-Nickel alloyed.\n\nThis works with Cr-Ni steels which is most of your kitchen utensils. How does that work? Because onion/garlic have sulphur and release it when its cut. You need to get rid of this sulphur.\n\nHappily, Cr2O3 layer on the top of your stainless steel will gladly accept sulphur and say goodbye to odors.\n\nBut the sulphur is now in your steel. So it has a capacity to take some. So if you start to rub your hands to your faucet, knives, sink after a few years in time you might see that it is not as rust resistant. Especially if you rub your hands to the very same place over and over again.\n\nBecause you destroyed Cr2O3 layer that protected your steel from rust. The Chromium atoms on the surface of the steel sacrificed themselves and formed a very thin transparent oxide layer on top of the steel. Now it\u2019s not working!\n\nSo you can do this on your sink maybe 1/2 times if you don\u2019t have steel bar of soap yet. If you do it regularly you will have an expensive and shiny replacement job.\n\nGood luck with that.\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/zq2qyl/comment/j0wcfd1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

    "postText": "Why YSK: You can walk into any pet store and tennis balls will be right by the checkout or endcap. When you search for fetch balls for dogs, tennis balls come up. They are cheap toys that provide hours of entertainment while being pretty durable. But, they are also horrible for your dog in more ways than one.\r  \n\r  \nThe covering is usually nylon or another material which are abrasive. It will wear your dog's teeth down. It can wear them down to the gums with time. It can make eating every meal painful because there is no fix. That covering also comes off in chunks which blocks the GI tract requiring lifesaving surgery they may not survive. I have lost 3 pets in those surgeries over the years.\r  \n\r  \nThere are far better options for balls that were made for your pet's safety. Apparently, I cannot name them or the post gets deleted.  But, there are ones of all sizes, types, and effects for what your dog prefers.\r  \n\r  \nLastly, pet stores, especially corporate ones are full of things not safe for your pets. Whether it is a dog, cat, reptile, ferret or anything else, do not buy anything without checking with a reliable source that it is safe or appropriate. I would guess that 30% of what is sold at the big name stores are not recommended or downright dangerous. I have taken in dozens of fosters or had pets rehomed to me from dogs to snakes. I almost always get given something bad for that animal among their possessions.",

Of course they knew better to use them as toys, so my cousin would just give them to me. (I used to make juggling balls with them) One night they actually filled my entire car with tennis balls as a prank. Needless to say I was late for work, but it was pretty funny. Anyways I guess I would add that you should not donate tennis balls to your local shelter!",

However, those toys should never be given to any animal without direct supervision, and make sure you don't give your German Shepherd a ball that can be carried by a chihuahua (i.e. too small)! Toy size matters in terms of GI blockages. Also avoid rope toys!",

Is this an issue with only grain-free diets or diets containing legumes or pulses?\n\n\nNo. FDA has received reports of non-hereditary DCM associated with both grain-free and grain-containing diets. Most of the diets associated with reports of non-hereditary DCM have non-soy legumes and pulses (e.g., peas, lentils, etc.) high in their ingredient lists. However, it is important to note that legumes and pulses have been used in pet foods for many years, with no evidence to indicate they are inherently dangerous. CVM\u2019s data show that pulse ingredients are likely used in many \u201cgrain-free\u201d diets in greater proportion than in most grain-containing formulas.\n\n\nDirectly from the fda website.\n\n\n9. As a regulatory agency, has FDA requested any recalls of pet foods associated with non-hereditary DCM?\n\n\nFDA has no definitive information indicating that the diets are inherently unsafe and need to be removed from the market, but we are continuing to work with stakeholders in assessing how the diets may interact with other factors that may be impacting non-hereditary DCM.",

What we can't nail down is the exact biological mechanism but a lot of places are doing research on it so we will figure it out eventually.

Food companies have done a great job marketing grain-free and raw diets as the natural and healthy approach to feeding your dog, but these claims have zero scientific backing. I have not seen a single well-designed, peer-reviewed study showing that grain-free or raw diets increase life expectancy or reduce disease risk in dogs. For grain-free diets in particular, there are many papers that link grain-free diets with Dilated Cardiomyopathy. This is a type of heart disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal.",

Some people add in things like water, broth, or wet food but if you do this enough you risk her getting pickier so just be aware of that. Dogs are smart so if you give in and feed her grain free or scraps she will continue to be picky. It might take a few days but eventually she will eat. \n\nAlso note that not all grain inclusive food are safe, many of the newer botique brands have been linked and some include grains. To be safe stick to brands that meet wsava testing guidelines, those are Purina, hills, royal canin, iams and Eukanuba. Purina has a really good salmon flavored food that my dogs love so that might be a good pick for her.",

It's possible he had some sort of food allergy but it's unlikely he's allergic to multiple grains because food allergies and grain allergies in particular are quite rare. \n\nIt's also possible that he got over the infection on his own and the timing was a coincidence, this is actually really common in the medical field. \n\nAlways talk to your vet about any diet changes, but the safe brands are those that meet wsava food testing guidelines, those are Purina, hills, Royal canin, iams and Eukanuba or any sub brand produced by them like friskies. If you are really worried a board certified VETERINARY nutritionist is your best bet, they know everything about diets and many do virtual appointments if you don't have one in your area.",

Otherwise grains are absolutely fine and normal. \n\nGrain free took off as marketing cause the brands (especially the big known ones) don't care about dogs just money.\n\nI always feed my dog 2 different foods at the same time. Usually a lamb one and a salmon. Sometimes the same brand. Or not. The counter marketing is \"ancient or wholesome grains\"",

Do note that it's not necessarily caused by the food made by these brands, they are just listed as being potentially linked. While I wouldn't put my dogs on any of these brands I also don't want to spread misinformation that your dog will inevitably get DCM if they eat the brands listed. While it is extremely suspicious, we don't know the exact mechanism so its difficult to say that every line of food from all of these brands is dangerous.",

They are members of the family sure, but they are dogs. My 18 year old Jack Russell loves raw meat and loves hard bones. What this \u2018vet\u2019 should know and should have said is that dogs are fine to have any hard bone: just not after it gets cooked. Cooked bones can splinter and are actually likely to cause injury to your dog. Wolfs eat and chew on the bones of entire carcasses. Use your powers of logic if you have any.",

I work in the airline industry, applicants come in and fail the drug test and are automatically barred from applying in the industry ever again. Ground crew, flight attendant, pilot, maintenance crew, does not matter. The worst part is management won't tell you this either. Decline the offer and reapply another day or get it out of your system before interviewing.\n\n*SIGH* okay apparently i need to clear this up for people.\n\n DUR you don't want people working on certain things while high, that is NOT what i mean. If you smoked on your day off and plane damaging or something else happened a few days later sober, you WILL get drug tested and fired/barred. If you applied and smoked a week ago and came in for an interview and tested positive, you will get barred. \n\nYes I do know that this applies to other fields, but i don't have personal experience or knowledge of the other places, so i kept it small but relevant. \n\nStop giving me \"well no shit\" comments because some people either may not know or don't think about it going in. Maybe less of a YSK and more of just a reminder. Jesus Christ...",

So long as they aren't high on the job, why does it matter? This stuff has become a social norm for a lot of people who grew up in the war on drugs era.",

Medical or not, it does not matter because it's national, so federal law applies.\n\nAirline jobs are just some employers like that.  If you want a job driving a truck for a company that serves multiple states you would fall into the same category, and they do, do hair follicle tests.  If you think shaving your head is a way around those tests, think again.  The release that you sign say's they can take hair from any place on your body, including ears, nose, and yes even below the belt.",

Its dumb, you can lose your license over it. Weed is a big NO NO to the FAA &amp; Feds. Makes sense though, because alot of people have touched the a part of aircraft whether its still in the hangar or out on the line. If there was a crash, the FAA will come in and shut everything down like its a crime scene. \nBut there are signs everywhere here that warn you just because its legal in the state, the feds don't say so, and it won't save your job.",

            "comment": "As I understand as a business owner, any business has a legal right to discriminate against an employee that uses a schedule 1 drug. that is because schedule 1 is defined by being a highly addictive intoxicant with no medical purpose. THC and hemp is blatantly misclassified due to corruption by tobacco, textile (cotton, wool, paper especially), and big pharma. it\u2019s literally illegal because of how much it will benefit people. I work with restaurants, Ironically most of the hospitality unions and hotel groups have mandatory testing and zero tolerance as well. State legalization is a great step but it only allows employers to do the right thing and scrap their policies if they want to. until the plant and cannabinoids are reclassified by congress that\u2019s all the states can do to protect your rights.",

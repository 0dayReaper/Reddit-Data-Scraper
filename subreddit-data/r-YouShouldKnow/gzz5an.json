And he figured the school took enough of his money and so he and his roommates all used the key to get free laundry for about a year. They didnt steal anything from the machines, they\u2019d just pop them open and trick it into thinking they paid. Well my dads roommate got a new girlfriend and she was constantly at their dorm, he tried to keep the key a secret from her but his roommate told her anyway. Well she always wanted to be the popular girl and when the roommate let her borrow the key she spent the entire afternoon at the laundromat letting everyone use the machines for free. Less than a week later all the locks were changed and the key was useless. The girlfriend insisted it wasn\u2019t her fault. Dad was pretty bitter about that lol.",

I'll never forget the time a family kept me running back and forth to the bar the whole time they were there (Frozen drinks, chocolate milk for the kid), one thing at a time. I'd drop off his drink, she would order one. Then they left me a $0.56 tip after paying with a $100 bill. I was a pretty new server so I actually went back to the table to ask if they forgot the tip and they just laughed at me. So I dropped the change in front of them and said \"if that's all you can afford to tip me, then I think you need this more than I do.\" Husband furiously demands to speak to my manager and I thought I was going to lose my job. Instead, after hearing the whole story, Paul looked him dead in the eye and said that basically if $0.56 was all they could afford to tip his servers then they couldn't afford to eat in his restaurant and banned them from ever coming back, then comped their meal and gave me the cash. I was floored. When he left the restaurant so did half of the staff. \n\n\nTL,DR- had a manager ban a couple from a restaurant for being cheap-asses",

If more restaurants took this route I think we'd have far fewer disgruntled cooks. The lack of theft note really hit a chord for me, the policy at my last job was 50% off one meal under $12 per 10 hours worked. The cheapest entree on the menu was a $14 burger. So after a long ass shift, we could pay half price for an app. It was wholly unsurprising how often a cook would \"misread a ticket\" just to get some food into em mid shift.",

Most people, unless they're on some kind of intermittent fasting or OMAD diet, will eat more than one meal in a 10 hour span. Hell, if someone works a double (12 hours) at our place, they end up with like $28-$44 (menu price) in free food. Our food costs are pretty small, so it's not like it costs us $44 to feed them. Even if they order two ribeye steaks (most expensive item we serve), one for each shift, that's like $13 in food costs for us. \n\nI don't get why people are so greedy when it comes to stuff this cheap. Happy employees work harder, are friendlier to customers, and generally boost your revenue.",

I\u2019d pretty much give it to anybody who asked me about my day or was buying a lot of stuff. It was a pet store, and I\u2019d even hang onto/ seek out better coupons for people who do rescue work to try to save them a buck - for one regular who bought 100 lbs of cat food a week plus cases of cat cans, I\u2019d even break her purchase into several different receipts so she would have more like $50 off $200 instead of $10 off. Had a bunch of regulars who would come during my morning shifts on weekdays special for the discount. I used it so much i still have it memorized. Code was 87799. Got very heavily scolded when a guy was like \u201cthe blonde cashier gives me $10 off\u201d when my shifts switched. \n\nLesson: of a cashier gives you a coupon when you didn\u2019t bring one, don\u2019t say shit",

So if you spend $25, and present me with a coupon, you get $5 of points you can use on your next purchase. It's basically a way to guarantee a shopper comes back for a second sale, but if you buy the right items, and you're careful about how you use coupons, you can get a lot of money in points. I've seen some people accrue $50 in points by timing purchases and coupons correctly. The highest I've ever seen is $200.\n\nIssue is that most people who shop at our stores don't want their receipts or coupons. We're supposed to throw them in the trash, but I keep them on my counter. I even keep it nice and messy so my boss doesn't realize I have a system going. They just assume I'm really disorganized.\n\nI encourage everyone to enter their store accounts, wait for the ones who spend the right amount of money on the right items, and then scan the coupons. It's quick and subtle, so the cameras above me most likely wouldn't notice unless someone was really paying attention (which the managers usually don't.) This means that instead of a shopper having $2 worth of rewards, the next time they come in, they will have around $10 of rewards. I don't tell them that I do this. I just give them the points, and hope that the next cashier asks them if they want to use rewards next time. \n\nMy managers know what it is. At one point, one of them was talking to me about the importance of keeping the counter clean, and jokingly asked if I was giving customers \"free money.\" That is exactly what I am doing. In my book, if corporate has enough money to print out all of these coupons, it shouldn't be a problem if the customers end up using them. And since I don't tell the customers that I'm giving them free money, they most likely won't use it until later down the line. Plus it's a guaranteed sale for corporate regardless. So they're still gaining. \n\nOnce and awhile a customer will notice, and quietly thank me. They may also not realize the fact that I am specifically not supposed to be doing this. But if any of them tattled on me, a very large highlight of my work day is going to be ruined.",

I don't think too many customers realize how gratifying it is to be able to give them something for free. It's really cool when you can make someone's day or get them to smile because they got more than they expected. And when they complain or demand to the wrong person it really kills the joy in what is sometimes a shitty job otherwise.

It pretty much always varies unless you order the same drink at the same bar at roughly the same time of day. \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you come into a bar that sells $2.75 bottle domestic beers (bud, bud light, coors, etc)  as the normal price. If that\u2019s all you drank each drink would be $2.75 however if you came in during happy hour the same bottle domestic would be $2.00. All of this could change if you went to a different bar though. So a different bar could charge $2.50 domestic bottle regularly but their happy hour price would be cheaper than the $2.50 but their happy hour specials could be at a completely different time of day. \n\nAny drink you order works like this. Every bar is different. If you wanted vodka it depends on the type of vodka you\u2019re drinking and the price of that specific vodka would change from place to place. Ultimately there isn\u2019t a \u201ctypical drink\u201d cost overall but it completely depends on what you are drinking, where and when. \n\nAt my bar my typical drink costs $3.25 but I\u2019ve been to other bars and bought the exact same thing with the cost going up to as much as $7.25 a drink. Hope that helps. Btw I\u2019m a bartender that\u2019s how I know lol",

Due to wanting to be nice and due to being pissed off that an entire fish market was left in my care after only 3 weeks there, I would hook up customers all the time. \n\nOh you bought $50 worth of seafood? Here's a free lobster tail. Oh you only want $2 dollars worth of shrimp? It's free today. \n\nEventually, one of the Deli managers came by while I was talking to a guy about giving him a discount on a crab with a damaged shell. He immediately comes up, yelling at both of us. \"NO NO YOU DONT HAVE AUTHORIZATION TO DO THAT!\" I'm caught of guard. Customer is scared off. \n\nHe then talks to me about it. \n\n\"Yeah you probably don't know, but you don't have authorization to give deals and discounts.\" He says. \n\n\"Oh. . Right. . Yeah that's not something I have done before.\" (Bold faced lie on my part. I was cutting people deals multiple times a day.)\n\nHe gets the most smug, asshole look on his face. \"Well yeah obviously, if you were giving out deals *we would know.*\"\n\nAnd in that moment I realized something. **They don't know shit.** I quit like two weeks later before my manager even came back from vacation.

Sizes were determined by weight, usually with a 2oz variance because being exact is tough, being in those 2 oz is tough. When i made cones they were always at the top end of the weight range just because thats how I was taught. New manager comes, makes everything underweight so she could take home cones to her grandkids without missing inventory. Was told I would be fired if I kept serving things at weight. Finally gave in because I really needed the job, it was the only one in town who hired kids my age. Owner sent in a secret shopper, sent out a cone 1oz underweight, was told if it happened again I would be fired. Eventually that manager convinced the owner I was stealing to cover up her own theft so I left the job. Owner couldn't figure out how every year she had dishonest kids at only this location when it was the manager the whole fucking time.",

I knew what was happening, and so did her daughter but there\u2019s no reasoning with someone who knows it all.

I would tell them that I was hooking them up because I liked them, and they were regulars. I also made a point of informing my customers that I would not normally do this but you buy so much from me so let me help you out. I got commissions of a percentage off the total transaction so I was losing money giving the discount but wanted to be helpful. \n\nWell, one of the regulars turned into quite the nightmare one night when I was not working. She asked for her regular hookup from the coworker covering my shift. when the person looked puzzled she said you know the one that \"Me\" normally gives her. when she was told no, she asked to speak to the manager and made it into a big deal and forced the point. She still did not get the discount and was told that they would be talking to me about it the next time I was in. I got in a lot of trouble and had to have my shift totals audited for like half a year because said customer freaked out when she did not get the discount I usually gave her. I never gave anyone the hookup after that. She even came to me asking for a discount again the next week. told her that I could not and that she blew it. she ultimately blamed me, saying that I should not get her conditioned to getting something if it was not above board. I just told her that I really did not care I was helping you out and you blew it for not only yourself but others that I gave discounts to as well. I also told her that it was above board if she would have kept the coupons and looked for adds in the paper. Guess no good deed goes unpunished and all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearned a good life lesson from that as well.",

            "comment": "When I was a manager at a caf\u00e9, customers would ask to speak with me all the time because they had gotten something for free in the past and are now being told it isn't free.  For some, just hearing that it must have been a hook up for them is enough.  But for most......they won't back down because they feel they have been wronged in some way.  For those, I play a little game called \"how far down will you stoop over some dumb shit\".  I explain to them the costs of running a restaurant and how if we spend money on fresh ingredients and employees wages for them to make and serve the food, on top of electricity, water, and rent, we have to recoup the costs somehow to stay open and that any employee caught giving things away is at risk of loosing their job(they wouldn't, this is all part of my ruse), and then proceed to ask the name of the employee that gave them something for free so that they can be reprimanded.  A lot of people at this point feel pretty guilty and scummy, and they do a lot of back peddling to say maybe they did get charged or don't remember properly.  Some ass holes actually provide a name, in which case I go to the kitchen if they are still waiting on food, and make sure their order ticket is delayed and everyone around them gets their food first.  It's the petty things that keep you going in the customer service industry.",

Sometimes, you can tell a customer that you aren't supposed to do something and that you could lose your job if your manager found out, and they'll still come back demanding that very same hook up you weren't supposed to give them from your manager. As in will literally request the manager and demand the hook up you told them would cost your job if your manager found out. Some people are just selfish, greedy, and ignorant, and ruin things for everyone else around them.",

A lot of times there are some sketchy deals from sketchy managers. Every time I was promoted there was some new sleaze ball trying to rent  the Mercedes with a prepaid debit card because they \u201calways get that deal from the other manager\u201d.  \n\nP.S. Enterprise employees will bend over backwards to make you give them a 5/5 on the survey. Literally used to waive entire rentals in hopes of getting that customer service score based on random phone calls.",

Customers complaining, coworkers complaining, manager intervention. The common thread in all of them is that someone said something to the wrong person, or at the wrong time. I never gave a deal that I wasn't supposed to, or something that wasn't mine to give, but I got told to stop each time to prevent conflict\n\nI'm not even saying there aren't times when it's obviously cool to bring it up. Maybe everyone knows, all the doors are locked, and you're hanging out with the staff after hours. You stand to gain nothing by talking about it &gt;99% of the time though, and why risk it?",

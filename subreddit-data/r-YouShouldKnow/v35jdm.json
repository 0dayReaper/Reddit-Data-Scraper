    "postText": "Why YSK: Harvard is one of the world's top universities. But it's very expensive and selective. So very few people get to enjoy the education they offer.\n\nHowever, they've made **CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming**, available online for free. And upon completion, you even get a free certificate from Harvard.\n\nI can't overstate how good the course is. The professor is super engaging. The lectures are recorded annually, so the curriculum is always up to date. And it's very interactive, with weekly assignments that you complete through an in-browser code editor.\n\nTo top it all off, once you complete the course, you get a free certificate of completion from Harvard. Very few online courses offer free certificates nowadays, especially from top universities.\n\nYou can take the course for free on Harvard OpenCourseWare:\n\n[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)\n\n(Note that you can also take it through edX, but there, the certificate costs $150. On Harvard OpenCourseWare, the course is exactly the same, but the certificate is entirely free.)\n\nI hope this help.",

            "comment": "I took CS50 in Fall 2017 with no prior coding experience. I\u2019m not sure what all\u2019s changed since then, but it was a nice intro into programming and I highly encourage anyone who is  interested to check it out.\n\nThey spent a lot of time initially teaching the basics in C (I.e. lists, dicts, for loops, while, functions, pointers, recursion, stack/heap, etc.) and then gave other languages about a week or two so we could see the syntax and usage differences - I remember we looked at Python, HTML and CSS, SQL, and maybe JavaScript (but I can\u2019t recall). Like another commenter mentioned, a lot of the homework projects were strange, seemingly useless tasks, but I think it was more about getting students familiar with aspects of programming. There was also a final project that you basically had free reign on (for example- I chose to make a game app using Swift). \n\nI will say that CS50 is a nice introduction to the basics of programming (which does ultimately make it \u2018easier\u2019 to learn other languages), but you\u2019ll also need to put in solo effort and keep learning and practicing afterwards to fully understand and be comfortable with whatever language. \n\nI worked as a Computational Neuroscientist from 2018-2022, and now work as a Data Analyst. CS50 was a great stepping stone that pushed me towards these careers, but I definitely had to put in the hours to make my skills useful to employers.",

I've gone to college for Biology, flunked at the chemistry part, but I excelled at anatomy and biology. I did welding for a bit and found out that job wasn't for me. I figured that i'm a bit of a PC guy since I built my own PC's, so I decided to take CS50X because its free.\n\nMedium term goals for me is just getting a decent job that allows me to survive without having to worry about money. I currently enjoy the CS50 classes, and i'd like to see where it could take me. I'm not trying to be rich, but if I have a bad medical emergency or if my car breaks down, I'm kinda screwed.",

TOP tells you the next thing to learn (IMO the hardest part about self-teaching), tells you how to do it on a basic level, then gives you a list of resources on that skill to expand your knowledge on it.\n\nThen, my favorite part, the projects.\n\n**Everything they teach, they give you a project to apply your knowledge to get to know the real headache, but also the very real satisfaction of making it work.**\n\nThe most impactful thing about TOP, for me, was that I never had to ask myself what to learn next and where.

You could just randomly boot off any one by sending them a message from this program. The friend wouldn't see the message. Their AIM would just crash causing them to sign off and the little door closing and slamming sound would happen. You could just keep spamming that to them and really piss some people off as AIM was life back in my day before we could text or use cell phones.",

Do not let the weird symbols scare you. You memorized the quadratic formula, you can understand an integral.\n\n\nGive it an honest effort and I promise you . You can learn it. \n\n\nI highly recommend another free course from MIT for single variable calculus. \n\nIf you can, find material from Gilbert Strang.

Since covid it can be a hit or miss but if you can go to in person meetups and force yourself to talk to people, you'll make the connections you need to get a job. Just ask people what they do, what languages/frameworks they use, how they got into tech etc. Remember to talk about yourself as well: what you're learning, what you're working on, blah blah. You'll meet recruiters, devs, founders who might have an opening if not now, in the future. You would be surprised at the people you'll meet. It helps immensely to know people since you're not just resume number XXX that probably got filtered out anyway.\n\nYou don't need a CS degree. At most go to a bootcamp to get you accustomed to waking up and coding for 8 hours a day. I wouldn't recommend going to a bootcamp without first having made a good effort to teach yourself though. As it turns out, teaching yourself and continuously learning are about 85% of being a developer/programmer/coder whatever you want to call it. At the end of the day, if you can show you work well with teams, you have a firm grasp of problem solving using code as a tool, and you are enthusiastic about growing your knowledge, you can get a job with a only a highschool diploma.\n\nPodcast recommendation: Code Newbie.\n\nI listened to this every day from the time I started learning to code to the time I got hired as a developer. It tells so many stories of people and their non traditional journeys into tech.",

The one through OCW has no identity verification and was just intended as a helpful resource like their free YouTube channel. You can type in \u201cHacker McGee\u201d on that certificate. Without the official one from EdX, you don\u2019t have proof of anything. And with this just being an intro CS course meant for 13+ year olds, you\u2019ll be stacking on a dozen or so other courses that are all $150+ each depending on your goals. \n\nSource; I quit my job and did HarvardX for data science last year. Still not finished but it\u2019s self paced so that\u2019s dependent on you.",

Much better to knock CS50 out all at one time.",

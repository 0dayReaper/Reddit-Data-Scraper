    "postText": "Why YSK: It\u2019s important for people to maintain proper hygiene and know that more bacteria can cause extra health related issues putting you and your loved ones at risk.\n\nWhat YSK: Long nails have more surface area than short nails leaving more room for bacterial growth. Various research studies have found that at least 32 different types of bacteria and 28 different fungi under nails including staphylococcus. This is why medical staff are required to shorten their nails as they pose a health risk to patients and can even be fatal in some cases. Studies have found that it doesn\u2019t matter what type of nails (fake/acrylic/natural/etc) you have they all carry increased amount of bacteria. \n\nThat said it\u2019s always important to remember finger hygiene. Wash your hands well and make sure you get under your nails to prevent harmful bacterial growth. \n\nEdit:\n\nGet a nail brush and be sure to scrub under those nails! \n\nAlso yes I know it\u2019s obvious to many of you big things means more bacteria, this is just to inform people to be more hygienic and to wash your nails carefully because you\u2019re carrying around more bacteria than you realize. \n\nReferences: \n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/04/16/long-nails-health-risks/9316671002/\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/personal-hygiene/nails.html#:~:text=Because%20of%20their%20length%2C%20longer,files)%20should%20be%20properly%20cleaned.",

No matter how many times I kindly remind people to wash their hand when we start cooking they don\u2019t. It\u2019s disgusting. Even when I tell people I\u2019m immunosuppressed I can\u2019t eat things if you didn\u2019t wash your hands and wash the veggies or if it has been heated up multiple times or if you cook it on counter tops that your cats walks around on daily after literally tramping through it\u2019s own shit and piss box that are known to carry diseases. I just can\u2019t eat things from anyone unless I saw them make it. It\u2019s sad. \n\n\n**immunosuppressed as in actually immunosuppressed and constantly battling embarrassing fungal and bacterial infections that normal people never get in their lifetime and not the trendy kind of immunosuppressed all of a sudden everyone was during the pandemic bc they had some random disease or took some random medication that don\u2019t even remotely make someone immunocompromised or they just \u201cget sick easy\u201d. Unsurprisingly I find these kind of people are usually the worst about hand hygiene and food hygiene in ways that would have an actually immunocompromised person seriously ill regularly.",

            "comment": "Alright nail tech here! I love long nails but it's true they are a thing that requires more maintenance.  And some people shouldn't have them. Food industry people,  medical care workers, childcare workers, cosmotigist, anyone who's work directly is going to be affecting people's health. \n\nSecond, if you wear your nails long if they are naturally long or are a sculpt. Wear gloves when you cook for the love of humanity don't get raw chicken under your nails! Don't risk spreading bacteria from your nails into food. \n\nAlso if you use a nail brush clean the brush! Soak it in a bleach solution for ten minutes. All that gunk on your dirty brush is just going right back under your nails. And it can damage your hyponychium. Basicly, the thin skin creates a seal under your nail to prevent bacteria from getting under your nail. And a dirty brush can just shove all that gunk into your nail plate and create issues. So, really only use the brush if you have a lot of debris, or cooked or cleaned something that has a high risk of bacteria.(which you should be wearing gloves!) And don't forget if your wearing sculpts to scrub up by your cuticles as well! \n\n Otherwise, for light handwashing or your without a brush you can really lather up your soap and get the suds under your nails. Rub under your nails well with your other finger tips. Rub under and at the cuticle areas.  Then point your fingers towards the running water to flush out from under them. This works for most things well unless you just did something that really needs a deep clean. Or your about to do anything that you need to have clean hands for. \n\nIf you wear a sculpt be it acrylic,gel or polygel. Get your fills! Do not go more than three weeks between them if they start to lift the lifts fixed asap. Most techs if repair a lift for free if it's been less than two weeks. Lift will fill with water and bacteria fast and cause a monsterous amount of issues. \n\nIf you wear press ons don't wear them longer than a week. (I am talking like the kiss nails  that you glue on) Don't wear them back to back. They don't create a proper seal on your nail, so it's very easy to get water trapped under the press on. They  cause so many of the fungle infections that a client tries to get me to fix (I can't I am not a doctor I will send you out the door!) The glue weakens your nail plate, making them more prone to infection and injury.  Not to mention all that bacteria under those fake nails can spread as well when you cook or clean or anything else. Press on are great if you just want nails for a weekend event anything longer I don't recommend them.",

Sensitive parts and fingers are a great combination  until someone has germy, scratchy nails.",

I'm much more interested in how often they actually reach the point of doing someone actual medical harm, and it doesn't say anything about that at all. There could be 40 million different species of germs living in my bloodstream right now; if they only cause infection one time in a trillion, they're nothing to worry about.\n\nThere's nothing in the articles that says this is even a remotely common problem, either. There's that case of infant deaths in a hospital they couldn't even definitely link to nurses' nails.\n\nI'm sorry to harp on this, because it could still genuinely be a problem and you're obviously just trying to help. (I mean, finding MRSA anywhere is *bad*.) This is just a big peeve of mine about clickbaity science journalism and it's always a little sus when some news outlet trying to cook up a story offers up a weird stat like \"contains over 500 chemicals!\" or \"had bacteria on every sample!\" without ever offering any evidence *it's a real problem for a healthy adult.*\n\nThat gripe notwithstanding, though, I'd rather someone with long nails wash their dang hands so I still appreciate you raising the issue. :) I'm just nitpicking the article's choice of stats, because there's probably a better one out there they could have picked.",

From what I understand, finding a bunch of different microbes indicates that people are carrying around different bacterial or fungal species that are likely foreign to your body. Although your body has some millions of germs/organisms living in your body, those organisms are essential to certain parts of your body. For example staph is common in everyone\u2019s colon, however finding it on your hand is bad because when eating you\u2019re transferring it to your mouth and your digestive track which will react badly with it. Essentially the more organisms you find the more likely you are introducing bad organisms to a part of your body it shouldn\u2019t be at.",

You\u2019d think it would be more common knowledge but many people forget to wash themselves thoroughly. \n\nAll it takes is to forget to wash one place and scratching yourself or someone else to spread bacteria and potentially cause harmful infections. If you look at the references there are cases of women in hospital settings who accidentally caused the death of infants because of bacteria under the nails.",

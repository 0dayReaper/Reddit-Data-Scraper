And that doesn't count individuals who were shot for dubious reasons like knocking on the wrong door or turning in the wrong driveway. The leading cause of child mortality is bullets. And it's happening everywhere, so you can't just avoid the dangerous parts - it's cinemas, restaurants, parks, schools. \n\nHealth care is phenomenally expensive. If I buy travel insurance for an overseas trip, the cost is double the cost for the rest of the world, even if I'm just changing planes in the US and never leave the airport. I understand you can't be declined emergency treatment if you're uninsured, but they absolutely still charge for that treatment at ridiculous rates.\n\nAnd those are just the starters. The list could go on, not least the culture wars shit that really would make anyone not a cis-het white male anxious.\n\nDoes it mean I'm not going to visit? No. But I would take the same kind of precautions as visiting a developing country, and not what I would take visiting any other Western democracy.",

I've also been to the US a bunch of times and never had problems. I've also been to a handful of other countries. I think the biggest thing that makes me anxious about going to the US is that it looks pretty similar but my reflexes would just be really off. And that can turn dangerous.\n\nFor example, around here, guns are really rare. If you get pulled over by the police, it's generally polite to just go ahead and grab your license and registration while they're walking up to your car. In the US, I'm told that can make them really jumpy because lots of people might have a gun in their glove compartment. I can totally see myself needlessly escalating a situation.\n\nAnother thing is that the car culture is just a lot stronger than the places I'm used to. I tend to walk or use public transit whenever possible. I've heard that in some parts of the US, that can appear suspicious on its own.\n\nPlus, of course your banking system is like a decade behind. So I'm much more likely to be very confused about what is a legitimate thing and what is a scam. And that can lead to conflict. My dad actually got into a bit of an argument with an American waitress one time because she needed to take his credit card to the back to process it. He absolutely was not going to let her take the card out of his sight. She was really offended and thinking he was trying to get out of paying. Thankfully, my mother stepped in before it got too heated and pointed out it used to be like that in Canada a decade before. He ended up paying cash.\n\nPlus, your homicide rate just is higher than ours, by a significant margin. So sure, I'm unlikely to get shot if I go to the US, but it's still vastly more likely than if I stay in Canada or go to Western Europe or New Zealand. (I'm not going to talk about Australia because I'd probably die of a panic attack just thinking about the wildlife, lol.)",

It's their decision to inform or not inform your government about your detention, location, conditions, charges, etc. Your words will not have any influence on them if you are already detained.\n\n2) You are a regular folk in a more or less regular foreign country. In 95% of cases police of whatever will be happy to give you an opportunity to call your country's mission emergency line. Because they will get additional confirmation of your identity for free, and that's it. Because your country's mission will tell you \"Hi. You are in a foreign country under their complete jurisdiction. They will treat you as anyone else. We are just random folks to them. Do you want a get-a-lawyer number from the top ad at google?\" \n\n3) Some kind of special case. For example, if you are a Ukrainian in Seoul, the police will insist you call the embassy because they love formalities, and if the consular is still the same guy, well, he's gonna come to the police station with a lawyer and start pretending that he has connections to help you.

This right is intended to ensure that individuals are not mistreated and are afforded due process while in another country. It also provides a means for consular officials to provide assistance to their citizens, such as arranging for legal representation, contacting family members, and providing information about local laws and customs.\n\nIndividual countries may also have their own laws and regulations that govern consular access and the rights of foreign nationals within their borders. However, the Vienna Convention serves as a widely recognized framework for consular relations and the protection of the rights of foreign nationals.",

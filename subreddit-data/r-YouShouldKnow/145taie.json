Waited until the prior post hit the required timeframe, checked the rules for repost and tried again only to be told the same thing. I pointed out that the prior referenced post was now 7 months old, they came back with it just reposted a couple hours ago. Couldn't find the newest repost and simply quit trying to post here ever.\n\n\nEdit fine, y'all disagree. But I had to wait 7 months to be told no, again and this is still up two days later after being posted 6 days prior? Y'all really don't like people talking about shitty mods apparently.",

In fact, there are zero safety standards or manufacturing regulations for dog toys at all. Since the mid-2000s, pet parents have been finding concerning lead levels in mass-produced toys, such as tennis balls.\"\n\n\"It may seem counterintuitive, but **researchers found that tennis balls made specifically for pets were more likely to contain toxic chemicals, including arsenic and chlorine. In fact, of all tennis balls tested in 2009 by the Michigan-based Ecology Center, every single one that tested positive for toxins was one designed for pet use.** Though the study has since been taken offline, many websites and pet resources were able to record and share the data before this happened sometime in 2022.\" [boldface is mine] \n\nWhy do I have an impression that the panicky style of the original post and its title suits rather well producers of dog toys?",

Just go into the woods with my dog and collect sticks. Trim and cut them nicely so they\u2019re perfect dog sticks, then package and ship to the zon. They handle it from there.",

Heavy chewers who are given hard or abrasive things to chew will wear down their teeth, whether it\u2019s a tennis ball or not. This is a valuable warning in that we may not consider the abrasive properties of tennis ball fuzz when we\u2019re making toy choices for our dogs, but tennis balls are not destroying the teeth of every dog who plays with them. They are contributing to wear on the teeth and this is particularly problematic for some dogs, not all of them. Dogs that aren\u2019t heavy chewers are not going to experience excessive wear from holding a tennis ball occasionally.",

While it can be filled with abrasive particles such as glass or carbon fibers, that's not the case for things like toothbrushes and tennis balls.\n\nEdit: I get downvotes but nobody will actually dispute this.

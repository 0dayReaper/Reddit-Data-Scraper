    "postText": "Why YSK: Understanding that there's more to depression can help to battle it or even stay ahead of it.\n\nExperience - As someone who's battled it on and off for 14 years and taken over 30 medications to help...I've learned there are multiple neurotransmitter systems involved.\n\nNorepinephrine and dopamine are also involved. For me serotonin wasn't the primary issue, the other two were. Understanding this and utilizing a search mechanism I'll list below can better help you understand what works well for you and what doesn't.\n\nWhen looking into medications and what they do, always use the term \"mechanism of action\".\n\nFor example, Google - What is the mechanism of action for Zoloft? Then see what receptors it works on and adjust. You can do this for any medication.\n\n**That being said the BEST anti-depressant I've ever taken is Cold Water Immersion in the morning.**\n\nIt boost dopamine \\~200% for 1-5 hours after and it only takes up to 3 minutes of immersion in 55 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. It also boosts norepinephrine (brain adrenaline). I thought this was horse shit but I've been doing it and holy shit am I 10 years younger. I'm motivated, I'm a better husband, dad, worker, hobby enjoyer, life enjoyer...\n\nOther things I've found that worked, focus on healthy sleep habits, VitD, Omega3s (2g a day for me), and getting sunlight asap in morning via a walk with my dog. Literally only walk a mile but sunlight boosts cortisol which gets you energized and moving!\n\nI have been doing so many things for so many years...I hope this helps someone!",

I also try to see the positive in everything around me. \n\nI was kind of a perfectionist and when things didn\u2019t go my way it sent me to a dark place and kept me there. \n\nMeds have kind of helped me (tried over 10 different ssri\u2019s, snri\u2019s, even shrooms) but changing the way I think and talk to myself/others have changed me for the better.

As for to just get started it depends how bad you want to feel better.  I just really wanted to start living so I changed everything.

I have a blood glucose monitor on my arm so I'm always making sure I'm in a healthy range.  I eat vegetables everyday.  I take a vitamin B complex, dandelion root, vitamin d and fish oil in the morning.  I take vitamin e and magnesium at night.  I try not to eat any salt throughout the day and limit my sugar.  I help others when they ask for help.  I speak to a therapist once a month.  I do still use a juul for a vice and have ice cream and candy when I feel down and it is more of a treat to me and makes me feel better than just sitting drinking booze eating like shit and watching TV all day.  I had just had enough and used willpower until everything I did started working and gave me the energy to maintain the life style.  Then I surrounded myself with like minded people looking out for themselves and we all keep each other in the momentum we are in.  It's a journey not a destination.  Good luck.",

Start with the smallest thing that you do have the energy to do. \n\nWhen I was really depressed, it was getting out of bed. That was literally my first baby step. If you have more energy, it could be going out for a walk. Or maybe getting enough sleep, practicing good sleep hygiene. Eating healthier, going to the gym, etc. \n\nFind something that you can easily accomplish until you can do it over and over again and it becomes an effortless habit. Once you've established that habit, move onto the next healthy thing that you can accomplish easily. \n\nEach healthy habit is like a rung in a ladder. Each rung will help you get out of depression. The key is to focus only on one rung at a time. You'd probably fall off a ladder trying to scamper up too many flimsy rungs at once right- so you want to make sure each habit/rung is solid before you move onto the next.\n\nEventually you'll be able to run up and down the ladder without any issues. Because we can't be happy all the time, sometimes shit happens and we'll get sad again (grief), but those habits you've built, they'll stick with you forever, and make it easier. It's like a mental muscle memory. \n\nYou don't need willpower when you've got habits. It needs to be easy and effortless. \n\nI think James Clear's Atomic Habits has lots of good tips on this.",

I also started getting up much earlier in the morning. This allows me to do all the things I have no motivation for first thing in the morning before work. I get to bang it out and since its so early its almost like it never even happened. Then I come home from work to another section of clean house, my muscles and body feel tight and amazing. And the massive surge of confidence I got is unprecedented and I could have never imagined that I could become so confident. \n\nI still have a lot of work to do, and still experience the usual general and social anxiety. However the morning routine gives me the tools I need to garner the confidence to push through that. Now I'm working on projecting my voice and strong body language. \n\nWhen you get shit done and done right, it makes you feel successful and accomplished, gaining even more confidence. \n\nIn reading some of the other comments, treating your body and mind well seems to be a commonality in getting better. Its not easy but man is it incredible to be living in the results.",

            "comment": "In 2022 there was a study where researchers found no evidence that depression is caused by low serotonin, calling into question how antidepressants work and if they are effective at all. So it's nice to see people discussing natural supplements like omega-3s, which are great for so many things mind and body, and then basic life changes like diet, exercise, and sleep. Inflammation has also been found to have a massive correlation with depression, anxiety, and generally feeling like crud. Those changes can make a world of difference. \n\nI've also been poor as hell and had to take cold showers every day, and it did nothing for my depression. So it's interesting that people are doing it to enhance their well-being. This is not a knock in any way, just, kind of a whiplash effect of... I did it because I had no choice, and now people are doing it by choice to feel better. Maybe it's the state of mind? A perception making your reality?",

A lot of people seem to think that study means SSRIs don't work. Just because depression isn't *caused* by low serotonin doesn't mean it isn't helpful to increase serotonin.\n\nLike another commenter said, SSRIs are more akin to a painkiller, helps with pain but isn't really fixing some underlying issue. E.g. Ibruprofan won't fix your chronic back pain, but it will make it hell of a lot easier to live with it.\n\nNot to say that other methods of treating depression aren't helpful, but SSRIs aren't a scam and they can be a lifesaver for people who are too depressed to make those basic life changes.",

We know activation of 5HT-1A is involved in neurogenesis, particularly in the denate gyrus whose neurons are immature in individuals with MDD. Afaik we know that this pathway is at the very least partially responsible for mediating the antidepressive effects of ssris. Ssris also appear to increase the activity of 3alphaHSD which reduces progesterone into allopregnanolone. Which is depressed in individuals with MDD.\n\nWhile its true that the serotonin system is very complicated (and often counterintuitive). Afaik theses hypothesis are relatively well accepted and at the very least add to the serotonin hypothesis of depression.\n\nI would agree with your last statement. These are just tools for different cases and we are very much in the dark on how all this shit works. Edit: Although the neurogenic model seems promising as it seems to be fundamentally fixing a problem, not just a band aid solution. But who knows, it may just be a chicken and egg situation.",

But there are many factors that play a role in treating depression and antidepressants are unlikely to be a sole contributor in recovery, which is an important thing to keep in mind imo.\n\nTo everyone out there who is not doing well, all the best from this random internet stranger to you.",

I was on 2 antidepressants and crying every bloody morning. I switched to Prozac (straight SSRI) from 2 SNRI\u2019S). The difference was astounding. I look back at it and feel I had vegetative depression. The switch to just the Prozac from Viibryd and Trinellix was again, astounding. Ive also been in therapy since starting it and that has helped wonders. The idea that therapy combined with antidepressants is very appropriate.

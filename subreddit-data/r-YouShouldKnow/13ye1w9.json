I'd say two things about what it doesn't have:\n1. The ability to show as many posts as Boost - even in compact layout with small font setting.\n\n2. The other is the most important and why I can't go to another client, including back to Relay which I also have paid for in the pas -  It reloads comments every time you go to another post from the post list. Even if you go back to the list and back into the same post it does that. No option to manually refresh comments, whereas Boost retains what was there. Handy if you're in the Tube and have pressed back accidentally or want to read comments on multiple posts without needing to reload them. \n\nOtherwise a solid app.\n\nEDIT: no username in compact layout is an oversight. I'll keep the app as a backup and have uninstalled Joey as I found it more and more frustrating to use but likely I'll use Relay as a primary backup. Boost is still the one for me. Also already launched the rocket again today in support of the dev after this news hit.",

It was an interim position, meaning it wasn't necessarily meant to be permanent. In June 2015 Reddit banned a number of large communities that they determined to be in violation of TOS, notably /r/fatpeoplehate, which as the name implies was a subreddit dedicated to hating fat people. FPH wasn't a small community, mind you, IIRC by some metrics it was one of the most active, popular subreddits on the whole website, outside of the defaults at least. Many people compared Pao to a Nazi and felt like this was censorship. A month later, a woman named Victoria Taylor, who helped to coordinate Reddit IAMAs, was fired. Pao was also blamed for this. There were widespread protests and attack campaigns against Pao and Pao eventually resigned from her post.\n\nSo... Here's the fucked up thing. Pao was basically singular blamed for these things, right? Well, years after the fact, it was revealed that Pao had nothing to do with either. She got blamed for shit she didn't do. She didn't fire Victoria Taylor. Victoria was fired by Alexis Ohanian, who still works for Reddit (he's a founder and Executive Chairman) and outranked Pao. Pao had no say in the matter but still took the blame. Pao also wasn't in favor of banning the subreddits that got banned earlier that year, she actually spoke against banning subs, but was overruled by Ohanian and Huffman (one of the other cofounders, aka Spez, who also is still with Reddit).",

But recently I\u2019ve been thinking about just how much I\u2019ve really learned, and if I sat down to write it down, I probably couldn\u2019t remember because there\u2019s so much new info all the time. And it\u2019s not because of reddit that I\u2019ve learned things, it just happens to be the most popular site for that kind of info. There\u2019s forums and groups all over to find the same info. \n\nBesides, I\u2019ll learn better by ridding of the attention span destroyer that is reddit. So I think a nice way to celebrate my 11th cake day is deleting my account, once Apollo is gone.",

I want the comments to appear when I click it.\n\n The Reddit app is an insult of unstable and unresponsive mess.\n\nIf a third party can better the experience of your users, thats a shameful situation. Even more so when you know how much of an headache it can become dealing with external API, yet they manage and haven't got any of Reddit's ressources. Maybe putting some love into your codes would go a long way. \n\nSkipping all the good steps to make sure they lose traffic, therefore losing value and the trust of future investor/advertisers. Good job shooting yourselves in the foot instead of fixing anything related.",

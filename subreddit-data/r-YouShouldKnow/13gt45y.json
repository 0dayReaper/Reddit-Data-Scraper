    "postText": "Why YSK: They literally will save your life and others around you who don't also have one. I have put one of these on every vehicle and motorcycle we own. I live in the North Georgia mountains and can attest to their effectiveness. I have had multiple deer stop dead in their tracks at the road side and watch my car drive by. Sometimes they even stop and turn the opposite direction and run off. As long as you are going over 30 mph it creates a whistle that they don't want to go near. I have also noticed that cows and donkeys will also sometimes track my car going by. They work!\n\nSearch Amazon for \"save a deer\" whistle. They are $10\n\nEdit: Okay people are saying there is no evidence for their effectiveness. I did not realize there are studies that couldn't prove it. I was just going by my own personal experience of seeing them react as I drive by. I was just trying to help after seeing a deer accident video in r/motorcycles and it breaks my heart thinking they could be avoided. Could it really hurt though? I truly feel they have worked for me.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m with you. And no I\u2019m no salesman. I use \u201cSave a deer\u201d whistles. They look like the small square two-pencil sharpeners. As long as they\u2019re installed in a proper place and direction, they do work. I put mine just under the license plate in the small groove of my underside front bumper. Which is aerodynamically getting the most air into the deer whistle, inconspicuously and not seen by others and it\u2019s not easily knocked off by car washes at all. All those others that you see in stores that look like small megaphones don\u2019t work. They\u2019re trash. With the deerwhistle.com one, you definitely see deer alert &amp; freeze or turn away from your vehicle/the roadway. This has given peace of mind to several of my acquaintances who\u2019ve hit a deer and then I gave them this.  They notice the difference too. That\u2019s no fluke and it\u2019s not imagination. Also, about those commenting on insurance, my old insurance agent would hand these exact ones to all their customers. Thoughtful and effective at saving headaches and dollars and proves humorously yet animal-loving truth, saving a deer. I\u2019ve had friends also try to say they don\u2019t work. Perhaps they are right about some deer whistles , but they\u2019re quoting studies done with the ineffective ones or experiencing themselves a whistle other than these.  I trust my own factual experiences, not some study or someone\u2019s hear-say. BTW, I\u2019m originally from Louisiana, aka Sportsman\u2019s Paradise and live in Texas, areas with high population of deer combined with high-speed roads.",

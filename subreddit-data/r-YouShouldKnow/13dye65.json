    "postText": "Why YSK: this is something I run into a lot in my work as a boat mechanic. I'll need someone to spot for me so I don't hit something I can't see, and most people don't know how to be a good spotter. If you're spotting for someone backing up, they need to be able to see you so they can take your directions. Make sure you can see the driver's eyes in their mirror; if you can, they can see you, too.",

The way he and I instinctively try communicating about the movement of large things is *very* different. We have screamed at one another over this.\n\nMake sure both of you know what means stop, what means slow down, what means left, what means right, etc. before anything starts moving.",

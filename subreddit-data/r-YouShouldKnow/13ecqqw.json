Kids or adults looking to experiment with drugs may buy abusable pills or be given some from their peers, not realizing that the pill is a counterfeit by an illegal drug maker.\n\nThey may not realize that they are consuming a fake prescription pill laced with fentanyl and that 6/10 fake pills contain a lethal dose.\n\nTherefore, you should know or tell your kids about the danger of experimenting with pills and better ways to manage their emotions. \n\nCitations:\nhttps://dropthefbomb.com/fentanyl-101\nhttps://www.dea.gov/onepill",

My guess is that the drugs are shit, they still want the person to get some sort of high, they add fentanyl, but at unknown rates.  \n\nBut yeah. No idea why at all.  Just dump some THC on it.  Or some acid.  Both are cheap and less likely to kill your client.",

Fentanyl has become so common that even a pill from a trusted friend may not be safe.\n\nWhen the DEA seizes fake prescription pills, it tests them. The DEA Laboratory has found that, of the fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills analyzed in 2022, 6 out of 10 now contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl.\n*\n\nI think you're either trolling or you somehow scrolled down and missed half the page.",

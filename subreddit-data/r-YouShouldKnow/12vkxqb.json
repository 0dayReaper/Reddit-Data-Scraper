They test for such a small range of sound and seem clearly oriented to people who are very deaf, very old, or both.\n\nSuddenly 'everything is fine' can turn into 'you have some loss' when getting to tests that go into the 20k range or beyond.",

Basically you can have things be really really quiet and really really loud and have ridiculous nonsense like 20-30 dB volume swings in the same file. This is the root of all of the issues because when you're in a movie theater that's perfectly fine, but at home we have stuff all around that makes sound or setups aren't calibrated properly or we just don't want something to swing 30 dB because it's 3 am and we're trying to watch Hobbs and Shaw for the 72nd time without waking up the neighbors and having to ride the volume button like it's a gear shifter.",

They mix and package the audio, but doing so as separate tracks that can be adjusted would be a completely different way of mixing, compiling, and exporting it. It\u2019s possible, but a not insignificant change that comes with extra costs and time.\n\nIt would get even more expensive and time consuming when you would then have to use two workflows for the audio production because they are still going to want the traditional audio setup for licensing the content to other services, theatres, or on DVD/Bluray. In those cases they aren\u2019t using the multi-slider system (likely proprietary) that one streaming service is using.\n\nIt\u2019s also something that consumers just haven\u2019t cared about enough until recently for the companies that set the industry norms and standards to bother changing yet.",

(Technically you can, but it's like looking at the mona Lisa through red/blue 3d glasses, it's not what the artist intended).\n\nDone properly, the sound design (which includes the mix) will balance everything well and complement the visual and emotional intent of the scene. \n\nAre there legitimate use cases for the consumer making adjustments to the mix, absolutely, but that's mostly to compensate for poor mixes, and user preferences. The argument could be made for disabilities related to hearing and sensory. Turn up dialogue and drop the explosions so they can also enjoy the content \n\nAs an artist, I wouldn't want everyone to go changing the audio experience I created for them. Unfortunately it seems someone in the movie world decided bad mixes = money, so we are stuck with bad mixes.\n\n\nOn the technical side, more audio streams require more data transferred and processed. For most computers these days, the extra processing on a download file will be fine, however streaming is kind of popular too. \n\nFor one hour, uncompressed stereo (2 audio channels) at 16bit (CD quality) audio is about 600-700MB. \n\n\nIf I bump it up to 24 bit audio it will be about 1GB for an hour of audio. For a 7.1 system (8 audio channels), it goes up to about 4GB per hour.\n\nHere's the online site I used to get those numbers. For the sample rate, I used 48kHz. https://www.colincrawley.com/audio-file-size-calculator/\n\n\nNo one streams uncompressed audio,\nso if we compression it at a low (quality) bit rate 120kps a stereo file is about 50MB per hour, while a 320kps (higher) file is 144MB.\n\nWhile the online calculator doesn't do compressed audio with more than 2 channels, we can figure it out ourselves.\n\n144/2 = about 72MB per 1 hour of single channel audio.\n\n72*8 = 576MB per 1 hour of 8 audio channels (7.1 surround)\n\n\nIf we split that into four separate tracks, music, dialogue, sound effects and ambiance. (I added ambiance because it's unlikely we want footsteps, bird chirping, traffic to be the same level as explosions. That brings up an entirely separate conversation about how the tracks should be separated. Do we separate screaming dialogue from whispering dialogue? Will we have to constantly adjust the mix of individual tracks throughout the movie to deal with that?)\n\nFor 4 separate streams of stereo sound that becomes about 576MB per hour or about half a gig, which isn't too terrible all things considered. (144MB*4)\n\nFor 7.1 surround, that turns into 2,224MB per hour, which is 2GB per hour. (576MB*4).\n\n\nThrow that on top of the video data, and assuming you want HD video, you're going to need faster internet or deal with more buffering.\n\n\nEdits: added tldr, and fixed misc typos.",

    "postText": " Why YSK:  Abandoned dogs in the country are almost certain to be shot and buried.\n\nMy wife and I own a small ranch in rural Texas. People frequently abandon dogs out here and I want people to know that when you abandon a dog out in the country, it is almost certain to be shot and buried.\n\nMany people out in the country depend on animals for their livelihood -- dumping a random canine with killer instincts on someone elses property is not a victimless crime and contrary to popular belief, we take no joy in shooting dogs and burying them, but are left with little choice when no animal control / no shelters are available, and our livestock's lives are put at risk.\n\nIf you know someone who is thinking of abandoning their dog, please send them this article or convince them to take it to a shelter.\n\nPeople suck.\n\n[https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-really-happens-to-most-dogs-who-get-dumped-in-the-country](https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-really-happens-to-most-dogs-who-get-dumped-in-the-country)",

He was a 6 year old rescue when we got him and he would NOT stay inside, he learned to open screen doors)\n There was a gang of like 6 raccoons in our neighborhood and my cat made friends with all of them, except the big momma of the group. She would kick his ass up and down the block if they crossed paths. He just wanted to groom her like he did the others, but she wasn't having it. \n\nEventually we started to keep an eye out and had a noose leesh we would catch her in to save Albert. We'd hold her still and let them just hang out for a little while, then we'd take her off down the street and let her go. After like 3 months she calmed down and Albert had a full gang of raccoon friends to hang out with.",

Unless the dog is highly adoptable, there is a decent chance the shelter will have to put them down due to limited space and/or resources. Following the pandemic many shelters are full due to the increase of people adopting puppies when the pandemic first hit. I also get the impression that the sort of people who abandon dogs in the country side are not going to properly train and take care of their pets.\n\nI know someone who had to make this decision for a dog (corgi) with behavioral issues. They tried going to at least a dozen dog trainers and veterinarians for help first, but were told that it was unlikely that it would improve much. In the end they decided to put the dog down. In their words, they felt it was better if they were there to comfort him through the entire process than drop him off at a shelter where he would be scared and alone for however long it took for them to decide to do the same.",

Will that prevent those people from getting another Christmas puppy in a year or two? Lol. Not a chance. \n\nThe pound is *always* over capacity. When I'm lucky they give me an estimated time when they'll be able to take the dog, and that's always months out. Usually, they just say they can't help. They technically can't even accept dogs found in my area so I have to lie about where I picked the dog up on the off chance they have availability. The only services that will take county pooches are private, and those fill up faster than the state or city-funded pound. Sometimes they'll take extra-friendly dogs when they probably shouldn't because the employees are animal nuts and will foster good the goodest doggos out of their own homes, but even that unofficial capacity is stretched to the max right after the holidays, which is when we see the most abandoned puppers. \n\nTLDR: people suck",

I believe that they will take the hr cats to get them spayed/neutered. \n\nWhat these people have failed to realize is that the cat colony is basically a buffet for coyotes. There are a decent amount of coyotes in the area because of the white rock lake nearby - and none of them go hungry. \n\nThey have basically set up a system to feed neighborhood cats to the local coyotes.",

I never knew exactly what it was but we always got cats with their eyes crusted shut.

All you have to do is be diligent enough to clean them and they're generally fine. Unfortunately, I grew up on an orchard where cats were dumped multiple times a year and there was a pretty significant feral cat colony. Once I was a teen I worked on getting them trapped and fixed, and adopted out. That being said, of the ~50 litters I saw and cared for, none of them died from having crusted eyes. They generally got hit by cars or eaten by coyotes and it broke my heart every time because I was a child who loved and cared for them. I even gave them names and snuck them lunch meat regularly. Cats shouldn't live outside and they shouldn't be dumped, but the sick eyes they get definitely are not a death sentence by any means. Sometimes it takes up to a month of being diligent before it clears up, but again, crusty eyes are not a death sentence for cats. Neither is getting an upper respiratory infection.",

I don't know if they thought the dogs could just retreat to the park or what. It broke my heart to take so many dogs to the pound or, worse, call animal control on the scared/aggressive ones. \n\nPeople are absolute imbecils at best and monsters at worst. However, my good boy Boozer was one of those dumped doggos (no fur, skin and bones, mange). I knew the pound would euthanize on the spot, so we spent an amazing 7 years together. \n\nPlease, don't dump your pets!",

I don't think humans have been harmed by them but they are able to kill larger livestock animals like goat and cattle because there are so many of them. Animal control said their hands are tied to a certain extent because of their numbers as well. It wouldn't be an issue if there were 2 or 3 dogs but there's just no way to catch them all at once.

Ranchers have to protect their livestock and the people in town will not tolerate dogs running loose and attacking people or pets. Very few people are willing or have the means to try and capture them to get them to a shelter or rehabilitation facility.

We probably shot half a dozen cats and one or two dogs every year- some rabid, probably half with mange or some other obvious problem, and almost all of them rail-thin. The dogs run cattle and deer, the cats spread FIV and kill poultry, and both are potential rabies vectors. \n\nIt was the worst part of the job, but in a way I was proud of it, for a simple reason. I never flubbed a shot. Every single beast died in it's tracks, without a sound, from a bullet through the hindbrain. I gave them a better dyin' than the coyotes or the animal shelter would've: our County had such a problem with strays that they were forced to resort to mass gassing. The Animal Control people had a reputation as drunks of varying levels of functionality.\n\nDumping an animal is 99% a death sentence, and only a very lucky, very tiny minority will run into somebody like me. The 1% who do survive will be large dogs which are far enough into the boonies to not attract immediate attention, and they'll survive by livestock predation until they hybridise with the local wild canid of choice and produce a Coydog or Coywolf, and *those* things are monsters.\n\nThese little lives are in our care. We owe it to them to give them good lives and clean deaths, and not to delegate or look away when the moment comes. I was raised with the ethic that if an animal in my care became un-keep-able, I was responsible for finding it another home, or for ending it's life cleanly with my own hand, and I am raising my children the same way. \n\nAnimal dumpers aren't just the scum of the earth, they're cowards besides, lacking the basic courage and decency to follow through with the consequences of their own decisions.",

The article said the farm employed 60 people, only 60. Thats like over 300 cows per person. I bet if i was watching 300 cows and trying to keep them alive and a starving beatup lost freaked out dog ran up on us fixing to cause trouble.. there wouldn\u2019t be much i could do to help him. And most of the shelters kill the stray dogs they collect anyway.. especially the ones that have been traumatized like that.",

            "comment": "I lived in a rural neighborhood outside of Austin and we would have dogs abandoned daily. More huskies than anything else. Luckily the town decided to hire a dog catcher. They had arrangements with the Austin Animal shelter. However YSK that we had a huge group of coyotes that would circle our neighborhood every night looking for stray cats and dogs. You can hear them as soon as the sun goes down and they have been caught on film. Sightings of them chasing down stray pets is horrible to watch. Surrender your pet to a shelter. Most purebred dogs have rescue clubs for that breed. They will take them in and rehome them. There are no kill shelters around. This is a huge problem everywhere. It is something that needs laws to fix it and humane solutions. Pets should not be considered throw aways. I have been in rescue work and in a loose group of people in Austin that helped get lost pets back with their owners. In all rescues sometimes you are saving the pet from the people and sometimes the people from the pet. We found out one large male dog that was surrendered had killed the dog it was with. Another had literally chewed up the owners wood bedroom furniture down to practically mulch. People who surrendered dogs like that are not going to be truthful. Cats either. I knew of a male cat that would sink it\u2019s teeth completely into the arms of it\u2019s owner on a regular basis. A dog may have just escaped an old fence or could have been dumped because of behavior. Be ware regardless. Also know that if you are the owner on paper and the dog injures a person or property you are liable even if you abandon the pet. Especially if you have prior knowledge the animal has caused harm.",

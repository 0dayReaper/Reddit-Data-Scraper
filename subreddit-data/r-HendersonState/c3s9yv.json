Idk if an email to Reddit could get it taken down, but this is a bad look. I\u2019m a graduate and nobody knows Henderson State, so I searched it and what I found is appalling. Mail order colleges have better subreddits. Take it the fuck down or use it. You could assign a fucking GA to do it every semester, it\u2019s an easy fix.",

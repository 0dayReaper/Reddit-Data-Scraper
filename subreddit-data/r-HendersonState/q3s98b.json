    "postText": "So I have found a reoccurring issue with former students of hsu. Many students have reported the school \u201clost\u201d or \u201cforgot\u201d important paperwork including fafsa. This leads to students losing all their financial aid ,including in school scholarships) of no fault of their own. Now forced to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket many drop out to cut their loses. Several students have had this exact thing happen to them to a point it almost feels systematic and purposeful. If this happened to you please contact me.",

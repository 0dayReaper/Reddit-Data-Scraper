French at least has somewhat consistent rules, e.g. \"the letters OU are read as a 'oo' sound\", \"the letters AI are read as a 'eh' sound\", \"certain consonants are typically not pronounced when at the end of words\", and so on. There are exceptions, but overall once you've learned the rules you're able to read French out loud without making mistakes every other sentence.\n\nBut English? Forget about it. If you tried a pattern-based approach, you'd pronounce \"lapel\" the same way you pronounce \"label\", and \"good\" the same way you pronounce \"food\". In many, many cases, f you don't *know* the correct pronunciation, you absolutely can't infer it.",

It may be included as a component of another logo for the olympics like [here](https://news.sportslogos.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/summer-olympic-logo-history.png), but cannot be altered. \n\nThis is a pretty awesome idea though.",

People might think 'huh, that's easy, I could've done that',  but I guarantee the designer either spent ages trying to combine the 3 elements of the brief, or they had a flash of genius - the type of which rarely happen.

It's a cool incorporation of the flag element but nothing really more than that. \n\nAn Olympic logo needs to be transformed into a graphic system that will span across hundreds of touch points. That's why they are usually far more elaborate and expressive. The Munich one is a great example.\n\nIt also falls into the classic trap of... oh its Japan let's put a red dot in it. Think the city of Tokyo will be looking for more creativity than that. The one they ended up going for was pretty decent in that regard.",

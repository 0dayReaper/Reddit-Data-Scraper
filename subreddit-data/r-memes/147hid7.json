The other is even more well behaved, not going on tables even when I leave some food on it. They have never destroyed anything and have never made any trouble.\n\nCays tend to act out when they don't get stimulated enough. Make time for playing with them and if you cant, get a second cat for them to play with. \nMore cat play means more cat naps. \nSet clear boundaries. \n\nI know this is a joke, but I don't like how some people genuinely believe that all cats are evil. \nThat's like saying all dogs are stupid",

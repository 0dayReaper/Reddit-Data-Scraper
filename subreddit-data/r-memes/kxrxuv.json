It was founded for a single project that I did as a student because it was less beaurocracy than our university employing all of us. We built what the university needed, sold it to them and shut down the company afterwards.\n\nSo far, nobody has cared. I might even imagine that some HR departments might see it as a red flag because why would someone in such a high position ever give that up to work for them?",

For shits and gigs I went to job boards to check out the kind of experience these positions are looking for and it's in the 8-10 year *industry specific experience* (which translates to 10-12 years total field experience, minimum) and they will waive the degree requirement for *an additional 10 years industry specific experience*.\n\nSo, if you have no degree and 20 years experience and this specific certification, which my green ass is being offered, you can hold this position, but somehow a bachelor's and four years industry experience (they waive a year if you have the degree) is equivalent experience.\n\nThat's how fucked this system is.",

Having experience means they don't have to teach you the basics of the job, and the can spend fewer resources on training and correcting your mistakes. This is great for an entry level position. If you've already spent 3 years working for no or barely any pay at an internship, that means they can use that when determining how much they pay you. Even better if there's a large number of people looking for jobs, because then they can just hire whoever seems vaguely competent at what they need and who works for the lowest pay. Because at the end of the day, their concern is how much this is going to cost vs how much this is going to make them. Your ability (or need) to find a job doesn't factor into that equation.",

If it wasn\u2019t such an inflated cost:wage potential I would have no issue. But the unwritten contract between college graduates and employment opportunities has not been honored for 20 years. Leaving us with insurmountable debt and minimal prospects. I\u2019m a scientist. I work in my field in a highly competitive market. I make great money. But I still can\u2019t afford to pay my debt, be alive, and buy a house. A realistic timeline is 7 years to make a down payment. Assuming the same income growth since I\u2019ve entered the work force. Which is ridiculous when people used to work as a college professor and still afford a house and a family.",

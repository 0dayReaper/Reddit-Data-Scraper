Come to think of it though, sometimes gifs don't play right away on my phone in the app I use, but that's only sometimes when I'm scrolling through the feed.  If I actually open them they will play immediately.  Idk.  I kinda assumed it was my phones fault.  Usually doesn't happen when I'm on wifi, but I don't really use reddit enough on mobile to know for sure.  Try the app Boost for reddit anyway.",

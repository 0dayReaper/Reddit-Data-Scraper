Four lots of lettuce, tomatoes, extra pickles, cheese, burger, onion. The works. Was a monster. The dude who made it came out from the kitchen to personally hand it to me in order to \"see the dude who ordered this\"\n\nHe was a fun guy\n\nAnyway moral of the story, most McDonald's employees around me are sour as fuck and are more likely to nick a nugget than give extra\n\nSo you are a hero",

ANd she was picking up a bunch of deliveries on the app and then having other people deliver them (kids/friends/something). It sucked because not only was my order very wrong but i couldn't actually get in touch with the person that delivered it (a ~25 year old dude). It also meant the GPS routing was completely off. only time i've complained.",

If I had I would have ended the ride and alerted the cops to a drunk driver. \n\nBut as kinda dangerous (bike lanes) and totally unprofessional (bar) as he was, I still felt like it would have been unreasonably dickish of me to give him only one star.

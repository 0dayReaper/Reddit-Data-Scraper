They have insanely sharp front incisor teeth like a beaver that grow continuously throughout their lives and have to be worn down by chewing. Like all other rodent species they are fast, have claws and sharp teeth, and survival instincts to fight or flee in the face of a deadly threat. \n\nI have seen common Norwegian rats (the kind you most often see as house pests or on shipping docks) that are the size of a small dog. They can easily take down cats if threatened. They usually will run instead of fighting, but if they are cornered then they do what nature tells them and fight to the death.",

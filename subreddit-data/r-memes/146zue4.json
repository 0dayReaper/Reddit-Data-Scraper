That's why so many people want to go back to their youth rather than to appreciate what they got in return for the youth they lost. Personally I love the present as my 6-10 year old self was filled with fear of getting yelled and hit by my dad, along with having little to no freedom. Now I have gained much more freedom and my dads mental breakdown sessions are less frequent. Although situations will vary.",

Therapy helped me a lot and it may help you too, just remember that everyone wears rose colored glasses towards youth; the sooner you recognize that the easier it\u2019ll be to enjoy stuff\n\n(This is based solely off of my experience so I could very well be wrong, but I hope it helped a lil)",

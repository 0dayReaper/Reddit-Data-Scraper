Yeah you can't film on other people's private property without permission, but anything is fair game in public.\n\nI think this is why paparazzi get away with it. Their actions are protected by the 1st Amendment.\nYou can also film into people's windows too if you're physically standing on public property. Apparently it's ruled that people shouldn't have expectation of privacy if part of your property can be easily seen from a public location. Cars also have less expectation of privacy since you're driving around on public roads",

You can easily see into a car while standing in public so there's less expectation of privacy. Of course you can't attempt to physically breach the car, but in terms of filming, cars are considered \"in plain view\" from public, same with your window if it's open and next to a public road. If something is \"in plain view\" from someone standing in public then there's no reasonable expectation of privacy and you can film it.\n\nUnless you tint up or put curtains on your car, but most states have laws against that.",

And now i feel the hurt again.",

What WSB's is doing is buying that stock and holding on to it so that the price gets forced up. Basically, the hedge funds have to lose tons of money when they sell back the borrowed stock, or completely go tits up.",

Then you hope the price of the stock decreases so when you have to give the stock back to the original owner you can buy it back at a lower price. \n\nSo the hedge funds went short at a price point of $20. Now if the price would decrease to $1 they make a profit of $19. Because they sold for $20 and bought it back at $1. The problem however is that r/Wallstreetbets is buying a lot of stocks thus increasing the price. Because the short sellers have to give back the stocks tomorrow to the original owners they have to buy the stock before tomorrow.",

And since a lot of people had borrowed the shares they would have to pay back more and more as the price rose, so that forced some to buy the shares back to close their position which made the price go up. Which then just led to a crazy snowball effect where more and more people had close their position. If you know what panic selling is, it's kind of like that, but with the price going up.",

It's over $400 now. \n\nPersonally I got some at $40, and more at $100. I'll probably sell 3/4s of what's I've got now, and will leave my original 1k in the stock. Probably next week, or in a few weeks when we're certain the hedgefund actually covered their shorts.  \n\nThe hedgefund should cover most of these profits.

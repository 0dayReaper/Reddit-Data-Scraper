They borrowed and sold more than 130% of the total Gamestop stocks which which drove the price significantly bellow fair market value.\n\nsome people on reddit noticed that there was far to many shorts and decided to buy and hold the stock and realized that if they bought enough then the short sellers would need to drive the price up to cover their loans. They shared that information and enough people agreed with their analysis and joined the buying.\n\nSo the stock skyrockets causing all the Wall St assholes to lose a fuck ton of money.",

People such as those on WSB noticed this and realized that they could buy gamestop stock themselves, drive the price up and hold it until the funds run out of time and have to buy that stock (this is a \"short squeeze\", as in, they're squeezing the people who shorted GME for as much money as possible). The inflated price makes that a huge loss for the hedge funds and a huge profit for the people currently holding the stock.\n\nThe hedge funds still have billions of dollars and a lot of influence though, so they've been pulling shenanigans like telling brokerage firms to not let people buy GME to try and get the price back down.",

Now the shares are just trading hands between investors. The stock could go to $1,000,000/share and it doesn't benefit GameStop unless they decide to issue more shares. GameStop is still GameStop and has just as much a chance of going out of business (or not) today as they did two weeks ago. At some point, the share price has to come down because the meme will pass and the number of people willing to pay $200+/share for a company with financials that support *maybe* a $20/share price is limited. The share price is high because people aren't selling shares at an equal rate to people wanting to buy shares. Eventually, there will be more people wanting to sell than buy; that's when the meme comes crashing down and everyone with shares is left holding the bag. And GameStop will still be GameStop (or not, they may be out of business before that happens as well).",

Just know that retail investors have been able to push up the stock of Gamestock and, because of greed and shitfuckery by hedgefunds, cause hedgefunds to lose billions of dollars. Because hedgefunds are losing billions dollars, Citadel, Robinhood, and other companies colluded in balant market manipulation to rob money cover their asses because they fucked up",

I personally use Revolut since I have an account on their bank. All the 3 that I mentioned above are chills who gave in to the needs of the hedge fund and blocked people from buying and only allowed to sell stock as per wish of hedge fund so I don't trust them at all (Fuck'em). There are others alternatives I just haven't looked into them because I'm happy with Revolut.\n\nIn these apps you don't buy shares as an integer unit. You trade your money for the fraction equivalent to what the share is worth at the moment of purchase.",

It's hopefully still going under, and we can make a profit on this.\n\nThis is the same company that gives you shitty prices for games and treats its employees like garbage. \n\nDo NOT forget that this company tried to label itself as essential during the early lockdown phase of corona last year and made its employees stay open without any masks or cleaning supplies to clean their stores to even stay open.",

You have a pretty good feeling that the price is going to drop soon so you borrow one share of that stock from someone, promise to return it, and sell it for twenty bucks. The price of the stock drops to five bucks so you buy it back, return it to the lender, and pocket fifteen bucks. This is called short selling. Several hedge funds attempted to do this with GameStop stock but a subreddit called r/wallstreetbets figured they would screw over those hedge funds by collectively buying a massive amount of GameStop stock thereby raising its value. Now those hedge funds have to buy back the stock they sold at a massively inflated price which is costing them billions and likely forcing a few into bankruptcy.",

I\u2019m in Texas and got one when our AC went out one summer. It helped a lot. You can also fill a shallow pan with ice and then put a portable fan by it to blow the cold air onto you. Other than that, cover all your windows , make your house as dark as possible, sleep on the ground floor if possible. Good luck. \ud83c\udf40",

Aircon is rare, and homes are designed primarily to trap heat. The fact they're made out of red bricks, means all day they're charged up like a bit solar battery. And then all that heat energy leaks into the living space at night making is pretty unbearable. \n\nThen we have humidity that never dips much below 60%. \n\nI have friends from Aus who say summer here feels hotter than anything they'd experience in Aus.",

Get a warm shower it will cool your body down. Same in the winter get a cold shower it will warm your body. But if you had hypothermia go to a doctor.  Have a great summer",

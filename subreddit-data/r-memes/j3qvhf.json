DNA is two separate strands that are wound in a double helix, but a major component of DNA are nitrogenous bases (aka the C, T, G, and A). G is complementary to C and A is complementary to T, so in fact every 3.4 Angstroms (0.34nm) the DNA strands are touching and holding on to one another tightly.\n\nFor the sake of the metaphor, I think DNA is a beautiful example of what true love could be. Separate entities, that are perfectly complementary, and when one is damaged the other can be used as a template to repair the damage.\n\nSource: Am graduate student in molecular biology/cancer biology.

I always love learning new things about biology (and other subjects as well). \n\nI was not kidding, because I was talking about the seperate strands that aren't touching, like, if you forget the bases. Just the double helix formation; they aren't touching. Like you explained, they are touching via those nitrogenous bases, but I was talking about the strands alone. :)",

If you imagine DNA like a ladder, then the backbones are the sides and the bases are the rungs of the ladder. Just to help correct your terminology, (I may have been a bit unclear earlier, so apologize for that) when you use the word strand, in the context of DNA, that refers to the backbone and that backbones nitrogenous bases. I.e the word strand refers to exactly one half of the ladder, rungs included. Hope that cleared up a little, let me know if I still failed to make it clear. I\u2019m always happy to do what I can to share what I know.",

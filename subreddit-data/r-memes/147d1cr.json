This is bad because all of the bots (think savevideo) are going to be hella expensive to run. Also third party apps that run way better and are ad free are also going to cost a lot to run. I heard.thr figure of $20 million a year is the new cost for some third party apps. \n\nReddit leadership decided to do this because they are greedy bastards who want more money from both traffic and people who do pay the new api rates.",

Reddit had a free API (Application Programming Interface) the API basically gave software developers an easy way to programmatically interact with Reddit. This made it super easy for software developers to create their own reddit app. \n\nIf you're wondering why someone may want to create their own Reddit app, basically the official apps would be buggy or just annoying to use. The API gave software developers a way to basically \"fix\" these bugs by making their own app. The Apollo app was a really popular one that I have heard of. \n\nSo to get to the core of the issue, reddit basically just said that the API will no longer be free which will essentially kill all 3rd party apps. This is also pretty bad for Reddit because a pretty large part of reddit's user base interacts with reddit through 3rd party apps.",

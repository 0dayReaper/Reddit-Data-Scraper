The rest of it is actually a momentum transfer from you to the air in front of you that you're displacing. As an example, in frictionless physics, if you run perpendicularly into a fixed wall, you can still be stopped.\n\nThere certainly is friction with the air to your sides, but you can also think of air resistance in terms of running straight into a you-sized wall with a very, very, very small mass/density (the mass/density of air).\n\n(this is why pointed objects can go so much faster, since they disperse the air in front instead of smashing flat into it)",

Additionally the air will kinda bunch up in front of it trying to get out of the way (making high pressure area) and will be scrambling to try to fill in the space behind you as you pass by (low pressure area). If you've got a high pressure in front of you and a low pressure behind you, there's a force pushing you back aka drag. \n\nDepending on what kind of object we are talking about, the ratio changes. A big ol brick might have a higher amount of pressure drag, a smooth teardrop has a lot less and the skin friction drag is a larger contributor",

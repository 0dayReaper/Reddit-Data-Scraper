According to a google search a starbucks coffee cup is 2.5 inches in diameter at the base, a 7/8\" USS washer is the right size to fit. Each of those weighs about 68 grams, so if you wanted it a reasonable weight, you would have to glue ~6 washers to the bottom of the cup which would be almost exactly an inch high.",

(Maybe it's 7.1 vs 5.1, I don't really know). Either way, there's an audio channel that filmmakers use for dialogue that's much quieter on the smaller setups that most people use. Turning this channel up on your sound system should help with this problem.\n\nUnfortunately I can't help you as far as which channel to turn up, how much, etc. since I haven't taken Digital Audio yet, but if it makes you feel any better, in a year when this is reposted I should be able to help out the next guy a little more. :)",

Russia is massively behind their timeline, and things are honestly looking really grim for them. I believe, if I read correctly, Ukraine suffered some 130ish casualties in their military, to Russia's nearly 400 yesterday. They're not doing well.",

The border was closed to men fit for combat, and they are all fit for combat and stayed to fight. They are leading from the front not from the rear, and when the people making that tough decision pick up a rifle and hold a post it makes those around them fight even harder. Although a sad situation, Ukraine is showing serious tenacity. And giving me personally, a reinvigorated hope for humanity. I hope with everything they can weather this storm until our world leaders act. They are certainly deserving of our help.",

He recorded a video from the center of Kyiv with other heads of the government saying: \"We are here. And we are not going anywhere.\"\n\nHe is truly chad.\n\nEdit: I'm proud to have a president who stays with his people.

The only people who were my height were children or those over 50.\n\nThe most striking thing about their population was not their height, but their weight. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have overweight people, but there\u2019s way less of them, and far less \u201cextreme\u201d cases. \n\nI also lost a few pounds, despite eating sweets and lots of processed carbs everyday.

They are very good at making low things visible. \n\nThe worst thing I did was get used to the hanging advertisements in the subway.  I would duck under them then realised they were just paper and I could just walk through them.  That all ended when I leveled myself on a bar behind one of them.  The level of concern from all the locals on the train was amazing and the laughs after I gave a thumbs up were even better.",

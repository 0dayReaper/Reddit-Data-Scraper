On twitch once you get associate you can play ads on you\u2019re streams to bring in some extra money and each tier 1 sub costs about 6 USD it\u2019s safe to bet that if they have upward of 100 subs and 1k followers they make relatively decent money \n\n2) are people going to donate bits or money? i\u2019ve seen varying results with the whole donation part of it, some streamers get quite a lot from those donations like Callmecarson Ph1lza and Pokimain make *a lot* in donations through just one stream, however when you step away from the big channels and move to something smaller donations vary from streamer. i\u2019ve seen streams where hardly a single dollar was given but also where over 1k was given. \n\nthese are just what i\u2019ve noticed as an advent twitch streams watcher and have had similar conversations with people who run smaller twitch channels",

Usually affiliate, donation and merch income pillars can be the same number.\n\nBut again, those are very few people who manage to reach 1.5k subs. That's a big community.",

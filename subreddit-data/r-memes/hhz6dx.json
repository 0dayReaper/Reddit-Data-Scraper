We were talking and she was looking in the rear-view mirror to make eye contact with me when suddenly her eyes seemed to convey panic and she said \"Oh my god, it's behind you.\"\n\nThe car was a hatchback so the trunk was open behind the back seat. I turned and looked over my shoulder. In the moonlight was Mark Zuckerberg smiling, lit from below like he was holding a flashlight while telling a ghost story. He also seemed to be wearing that silver makeup that mimes wear when they pretend to be statues.\n\nIn my panic and need to protect my mother from this leering robot, I turned around, pulled back my fist, and swung at him. I was still so surprised at his sudden appearance that while doing so, I screamed \"Holy shit!\"\n\nI woke up doing the same thing in real life. That really surprised my girlfriend, who was big spoon at the moment. Sorry, girl. I was aiming for Zuck.",

They know what wifi you are connected to and where that is located, they know who else is on that wifi, what they like and what they searched recently. So you have a conversation about vacuums, your friend pulls out his phone to show you what vacuum he recommends. Facebook tracks that, recognize you are probably talking about vacuums, and displays an ad for vacuums to you.",

Please Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Apple has it so that the camera can't physically turn on without first turning on the green light as well. It's a hardware restriction that software itself cannot bypass. Like the camera and the web light are on the same circuit path and there's only one way to turn on the camera no matter how software is written to turn it on",

I'm hoping most of this discussion is all in fun / passing the time, but seems like a lot of people are actually taking these answers even remotely seriously, and questioning humanity so...  it's very, very unlikely even a single person 'got' any of the odd answers, and almost entirely certain that people chose those options because it was funny. \n\nI would have picked an odd one for sure, and not for a minute thought that any observer would see that as anything other than a joke.  I'm more concerned that it's some big meta-joke, 'look at the outsiders actually thinking we'd seriously take a joke poll as an indication of average IQ/education level of twitter users...'",

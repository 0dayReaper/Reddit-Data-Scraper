It's Teatro in Spanish and Italian and the original Greek is \u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd - Theatron - so the British spell feels more correct to me. Then there's Zucchini/Courgette where American English uses an Italian word, while British English uses a French one, and Eggplant/Aubergine where American English uses an English word, while British English uses a French one again. So I think we're right about the spelling of Theatre here in the UK, but we only get it right because we're habitually copying the French, which is more embarrassing than getting it wrong.",

Webster was annoyed particularly at the elite in England, whom he felt were always trying to change the language. He wanted the words to more often be pronounced as written. \n\nOne bit of historyI learned from reddit a while ago is that the British pronunciation of \"schedule\" is based on the French influence, whereas Webster switched it to the original Greek \"sk\" sound for the Americans - which is the pronunciation we use.",

News papers had a quota for number of characters in a publication and to still make an interesting piece it wasnt possible to use the British spelling for words so a lot of words lost letters and were rearranged to meet these numbers. Also the \"misspelling\" of the words worked as a form of advertisement people would run into the kid peddling newspapers and the misspelling would catch their eye causing them to want to read the paper.",

She moved to the Netherlands when she was like 18 in the early 60\u2019s and married a dutch man, raising her children in dutch and only having dutch friends. She was generally only speaking english when talking on the phone/visiting family in the UK. Almost 60 years later her dutch is very good, but she still has a very noticeable english accent when speaking dutch. According to her family in the UK though, she now speaks english with a slight dutch accent. To me it just sounds like normal UK english though, so it\u2019s probably very subtle. \n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t really like that my sister and I lean more towards the American pronunciation due to tv and stuff. Says it\u2019s a shame because American english sounds so much uglier. Can\u2019t say I really disagree with her.",

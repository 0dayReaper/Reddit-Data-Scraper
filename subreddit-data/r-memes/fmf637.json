My understanding is their calendar works in cycles. \n\n2012 wasn't meant to be the end of the world. It's regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle. I think it's very open for debate what the end of the cycle meant. But in 2012 this happened:\n\n&gt; \"In April\u2013May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the ***La Corona*** site in Guatemala. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k\u02bcatuns with the future completion of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time\"\n\nsource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon#La_Corona",

He debunked this during the first day of class, though he spoke some of the language for us.\n\nHis job entails going on expeditions to sites in Central and South America during the summer. He has even discovered some Maya stelae and done writing for scientific journals.\n\n[John Major Jenkins] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major_Jenkins) was the pseudoscience writer who popularized the idea of the Maya Doomsday Calendar. The man was obsessed with merging his ideas of astronomy and cosmology with Maya artifacts.",

As soon as you're born, sure, you're living, but your death clock starts at the exact same time. \n\nBeginning to decay after early-mid 20s is what I was alluding to, and I agree, that's \ud83d\udcaf true from a biological standpoint. \n\nHowever, just because you don't start decaying until that age, doesn't mean that your death clock (or life clock, I suppose?) didn't start the moment you were born, as you're still moving closer to a state of decay, even if you're not decaying at that particular time",

If they look like an adult and act like an adult, they're an adult for all intents and purposes.",

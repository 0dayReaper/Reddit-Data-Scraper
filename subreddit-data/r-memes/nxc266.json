Paint melted off the walls. Very surreal to see charred or deformed remnants of the things you once valued very highly for one reason or another. Lots of lessons learned including having not only fire extinguishers, but the appropriate kinds for the types of fires you might expect, changing the batteries in your smoke detectors when you change your clocks for DST, and a clear escape plan for all occupied areas of your home, especially if multi-story. \n\nBut by far the most valuable and long lasting lesson has been \u201cstuff\u201d. I enjoy stuff, always cognizant that one day it might not be there. And that\u2019s ok.",

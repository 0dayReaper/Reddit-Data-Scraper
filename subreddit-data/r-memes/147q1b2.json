I bet when you look at these 48 hours numbers you are going to see a massive spike in traffic from everybody shitposting memes and scrolling through Reddit waiting for it all to burn down.\n\nJust thought of something. If increased scrolling increases ad revenue and everybody is just scrolling through Reddit trying to find a sub that works.....does that not mean that Reddit is actually raking in the ad revenue more than usual? I mean these got to be pretty good numbers for a Monday.",

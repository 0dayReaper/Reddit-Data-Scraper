GME just hired a new CEO with a great track record and the slow down of their B&amp;M business hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as some feared. The company was net cash positive even before all this and now actually stands a chance at revitalizing the business if the board can figure out a good way to do so. Lots of people are buying it as a legit investment instead of for the memes.",

There is always the possibility that the price goes up and you lost your bet.  \n\nWhat you are seeing is rich people mad because they are loosing at their own game.  Now they want someone to actually change things so they can't lose again, not so that this can't happen again(short more than 100% of available shares)\n\nI also say if you are worried about the everyday Joe losing money, don't, they most likely don't have stocks anyway.  If you still are, were you worried when the first bailout was passed and people only got hundreds while these corporations got millions while the cost is spread among the people.",

My thesis has been that normal people are just as good as, if not better then, Wall Street at evaluating stuff like social media trends and the last week has been solid evidence towards my case.\n\nThere are countless hedge funds that could have identified and profited from the same opportunity before WallStreetsBets had the chance to get in, but they didn't.\n\nEDIT: Ironically enough, one of the first things I started collecting data on was WallStreetBets discussion.

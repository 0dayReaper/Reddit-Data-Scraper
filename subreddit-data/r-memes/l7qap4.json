Well now I gotta go to the store to buy candy to give to you. But all the stores are sold out because everyone loves candy.\n\nYou are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost. So I pay lots of money for super expensive candy that nobody else buys.\n\nNow I'm very sad cause I have no candy and I have no money :(\n\nIm Melvin Capital, the candy is GameStop, and everyone buying candy is Reddit.\n\nCopy and paste it to spread the explanation!\n\n(Someone please make a bot that replies with this message, I'm tired of copy and pasting)",

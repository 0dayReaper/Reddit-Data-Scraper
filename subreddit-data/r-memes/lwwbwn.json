Its a cleric or shaman boss or even some weird disgusting regenrating tumor alien? Fine, let it have active regen or a cooldown heal, but less armor and health to start. \n\nHOWEVER I absolutely despise it when the boss is finally out of health but \u201cwoah omg youve only unleashed my power\u201d *Boss health bar refills completely, now the boss is bigger, angrier and literally just received a 25% buff to everything to emulate \u2018difficulty\u2019* \n\nWe all know what an enrage phase is just put it near the end of the original health bar and transition into the enrage with a cutscene.",

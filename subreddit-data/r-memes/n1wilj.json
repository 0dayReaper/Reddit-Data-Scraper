I lost most of my grip in both hands after an overdose and it took about a year before I could grip cups without handles so in restaurants I would just leave them on the table and use a straw. I think I prefer that to the zip tie thing personally but maybe other people don't",

It was an OD on a particular antidepressant with a fairly uncommon side effect of loss of muscle control, which is what compounded into my hands being for aesthetic purposes only for so. It was and is hard mostly because I played the piano well before, now not so well. They are getting much stronger but the dexterity takes longer to regain than the strength. I am happy to have even the strength back though!",

The People's Republic of China oppresses Tibet and puts Uyghurs into labor/concentration camps, in addtion to being really, really, really shitty to their citizens.\n\nSure China may appear to be becoming capitalist, the government is still hard-line communist. As long as those capitalists don't speak out against communism, they're gold. One slip of the tongue and they're in deep shit.\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China is really shitty.\n\nFun fact TenCent has a strong stake in reddit so I fully appreciate the irony.",

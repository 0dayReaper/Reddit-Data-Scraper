The skin will be safe and secure on the damn band-aid's glue, and I'll be needing a new band-aid to cover a larger and now BLEEDING area.\n\nThe trick is to loosen the skin from the band-aid, not the other way around. Lift up a little flap, and push down the skin while holding on the band-aid or surgical tape, which is my Nemesis glue. Plus I'm a tiny tad allergic to those glues/band-aids/tapes, so I'll likely have some blistering or swelling going on under those too, to make it EXTRA DAMN PAINFUL to remove them \ud83e\udd2c\n\nPull down the skin, do not rip, just hold on to the tape while gently pulling the skin off of the glue. No pain, and no skin loss \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48",

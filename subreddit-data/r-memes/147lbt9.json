            "comment": "I have something to share, somewhat similar. I was in third grade and the teacher was explaining us a math concept (the concept of approximation or rounding of). She was explaining with small numbers like 6, 14 etc. and I started Solving the questions in my book becuz I thought \"huh such an easy concept imma Try this out real quick\". The teacher saw me and she lost control becuz I didn't listen her for a min, she called me in front of the class to solve a question but the number she gave me to round off was a very big digit. I stood on silence there, she held me and slaped as hard she could on my face and I started crying. She showed no remorse or anything. When i got back home, my sweet mother motivated me after I told her, she helped me overcome such a trauma. Love you mom &lt;3",

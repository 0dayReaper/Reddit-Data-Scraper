I read those laws out of curiosity and that seems to be the case. \n\nEither way, a lot of child protection organizations have asked people to please stop reporting anime stuff to them because there's no victim and it's taking up resources that they could be putting into, y'know, saving children from being exploited so the moral outrage is actually pretty harmful. \n\nAs bad as that is though, it is kind of funny how so many people will argue til they're blue in the face that \"fiction doesn't affect reality\" and \"liking x in fiction doesn't mean you like it irl\" until it's something they don't like and then suddenly fiction affects reality and liking something in fiction totally means you wanna do it irl. Interesting how that one works.",

There's none. It's stupid to assign and age to a drawing.\n\nAnd that's not even talking about some characters with even more messed up ages. Take Miss Martian. Technically she's like 50, but biologically her body looks like that of a 16 year old cause she's a martian. Is she underage?\n\nOr Shazam, he's a literal kid but his powers grant him the mind and body of an adult. Is he underage? Does it even matter for him?

Most people wouldn\u2019t survive a single night in -1 degrees Celsius, and 30 degrees Celsius would also take a toll on most people after a few weeks of never ever experiencing cooler temperatures. Heat exhaustion or heat stroke, or maybe sleep deprivation, which can be fatal if it continues for longer durations. \n\nNow I\u2019m talking these temperatures all around your body. So no warm jacket for the guy in the -1 Celsius, and no aircon, fan or cold water for the guy in 30 degrees Celsius. Ie nothing that stops them from fully experiencing the temperature.",

So in southern Florida, the sun is only about 1 or 2 degrees away from being directly overhead at peak. \n\nThe long, straight stretch of the Missouri/Arkansas border (nearly the most southern part of the Midwest) is 36 degrees latitude. Peak sun elevation is about 12 degrees away from being directly overhead. \n\nSo in summer you can literally get more sun in Florida even if the temperature is the same as it is in the Midwest.  Of course in northern Florida the sun isn't so high in the sky, but in North Dakota or Minnesota it's even lower. In the Midwest the US-Canada border is at the 49th parallel, so the sun doesn't get beyond 65 degrees above the horizon (25 degrees away from being directly overhead.)\n\nEven with great lakes humidity, people in upstate New York won't \"burn up\" as fast as people in Florida.",

And with humidity ranging from 25-95%. \n\nAir Conditioning units are standard and built into home because fans are going to cut it at higher temps or extreme humidity. \n\nThat's the primary difference between the US and UK. Since the US has several distinct regional ecosystems, what that region is prepared for is usually different from the UK. The most similar ecosystem to the UK would be the New England area (which has New York and Massachusetts).",

            "comment": "I live in Germany and last year it went up to like 39\u00b0C where i live. And honestly the only time it bothers me is at work because i work outside and i have to wear long pants and thicc shoes for safety reasons. When i am at home and i just dont move it is okay, but i also live really close to the Sea so i can just go for a swim, that usually feels really good after a hot day.\n\nAnd i think AC is not very common here, at least i never heard from anybody that they have one. most only have these small fans that move the air around you, my cats really like that one too",

It makes it take longer for your house to reach the same temperature as it is outside. A well insulated house would keep the interior cooler for longer, during hot weather. Assuming you didn't have singles glazing, or the windows/doors open.\n\n\nThe UK actually has pretty terrible insulation. Which means you freeze your tits off in winter, and cook like a chicken in summer. If you are quickly sweltering when the heat spikes, I'd suggest it's because you lack insulation. \n\n\nThink of an insulated house like a thermos flask. It can keep the liquid hot or cold, for long periods. That's all insulation is. A barrier between two heart zones. It doesn't make it hotter or colder. I'm not sure why so many people think otherwise.",

When used as a dry grain, the seed is also called a pulse. Ligmas are grown agriculturally, primarily for human consumption, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known ligmas include alfalfa, clover, beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils, lupins, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts, and tamarind. Ligmas produce a botanically unique type of fruit \u2013 a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides.\n\nLigmas are notable in that most of them have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in structures called root nodules. For that reason, they play a key role in crop rotation.",

The snake goes to the end of the screen, down one level... and eats a fucking apple. I think I might remember playing a game like that when I was 7. And it wasnt even a hard difficulty, I sat there watching wondering wtf this even was because he got 3 apples in 2 minutes, then I realized I'm watching this crap, wondered if I counted as one of the 11k currently watching... \n\nI wouldnt mind a tortoise.",

The vast majority that had a combat deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan just sat around most of the time. Infantry of course is going to go out on patrol and stuff, but if you are anything else, even other direct combat positions like 11C or any of the artillery MOSs in the Army you basically just sat around at your base playing video games or being board as shit.\n\nThe ones not on combat deployments? Yea they just sat around playing video games or being bored as shit in Germany.\n\nThe vast majority of people in the US military are in non-combat roles because it takes a LOT of work to support those that are. It is like looking at the staff of a NFL team and going \"dang that is a lot of players!\" when most are actually coaches/trainers/assistants/etc there to support the players.",

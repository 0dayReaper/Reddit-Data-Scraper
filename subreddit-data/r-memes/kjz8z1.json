Turns out no, they just switched to discord.  Now I have to go add them in discord and search it there (discord is terrible at this btw).\n\nI don't understand why everyone uses it so much.  It should be an instant messaging app for you and your friends.  Or maybe a voice chat service for a game.  Should not be used in place of a forum, so frustrating.\n\nI'll get off my soapbox now, sorry this is just really frustrating but I fell like an old man saying how it was so much better in the old times.",

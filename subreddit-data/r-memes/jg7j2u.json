How an object travels through a complex gravity field, especially with moving sources of gravity is very challenging.\n\nThe way these things are calculated are with \"Finite Element Integration\". You basically start with the asteroids origin, calculate the gravity based off the objects you know. Then accelerate it in that direction for some small step of time, say 0.001 seconds, and find it's new position. Then repeat this to find the path of positions and its future location.\n\nThe problem is there is always some error with each step, and the farther your move forward, the larger that net error becomes. They may have predicted this path, but with the probability of hitting the earth something significant enough to be concerned. If there was a 1% chance, that's something worth talking about.",

Impacts happen all the time on other planets and the moon, even earth\n\nFortunately, these hits are usually so small that they don't matter\n..\n\nBut if an asteroid, or a debris field large enough enters our system.. well... You know how that ended for the dinosaurs",

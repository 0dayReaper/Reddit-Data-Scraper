Rolex is expensive because of it's history, being the first watch to do various things, Omega has the first watch in space, Longines has a history with aviation, etc etc. Even common watches go up in value because of pedigree, a lot of those cheap throwaway military issue watches from WW2 or Vietnam are worth thousands now. Companies like Fortis have even tried to enhance their own pedigree by paying to send their watches into space",

Its not even super consistent the way brands get valued. Tissot has been around for awhile but they're relatively cheap in comparison. Seikos are pretty affordable despite their extensive pedigree. A bulova  went to the moon too but you can pick their space watch for a fraction of an Omega. An Omega model can cost more than a new third row SUV because it was worn by navy divers but a citizen model that was issued to SAS divers isn't worth nearly as much.",

Clothes, jewelry, furniture, decorations for their houses. Out of everything it watches that you people feel smug about cheaping out on. \n\nYes, a $5 watch tells the same time (while it's still working) with a very cheap build quality, and not exactly stylish for something you likely wear every day. It also tells the same time as the phone already in your pocket. You don't need to buy a Rolex or anything like that, just not some cheap plastic thing from Walmart.\n\nYes, high end watches get ridiculously overpriced, just like clothes do. For some people it's about showing off their money",

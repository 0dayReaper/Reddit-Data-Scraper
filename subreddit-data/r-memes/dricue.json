It\u2019s annoying though, so they didn\u2019t keep it on very long. Lol \n\nYa know what, when it gets dark tonight ima do it again in the parking lot and see if it\u2019s super bad.

I begged my parents to let me bring the game boy with me or let me get to somewhere I could save. They didn\u2019t, and I was livid. Priorities as a kid lol...",

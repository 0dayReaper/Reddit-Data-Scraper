Works really well working with high functioning mentally ill and dangerous clients in group homes. They act out to try to get staff to react and I just stand there, pretty much ignoring. Nothing gives me more pleasure these days than a client getting overly verbally aggressive turning red in the face until they can't scream anymore and my only reaction at the end is \"are you done?\" And walk away. Pisses them off that I'm not scared by their posturing and using their diagnoses as an excuse to be an asshole.",

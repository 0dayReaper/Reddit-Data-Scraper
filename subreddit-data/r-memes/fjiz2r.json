And I don't mean like billions of agents to watch over but like 50 people per agent. (25 for the new guy and 100 for the experienced) and these guys job is to check up on each of their 50 everyday and some actual grow attached. \"Nice job Matt I knew you'd pass that test!\" \"Damnit girl they are no good to you and if you get your heart broken boi better square up! Aye Jeffery you better watch your boi I'ma whoop him!\" \"ah shit man 65th birthday already I'm wishing you more years I ain't ready to see you go yet.\" \"Oh no  don't think like that, there is so much more to you then you could imagine, life ain't so bad and it gets better if only you could see what I see you'd find out you're special in your own way and deserve not only life but respect from both your colleagues and yourself, hang in there!\"",

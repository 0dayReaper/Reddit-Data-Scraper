That's is up to you. If the company helps, that's a bonus and reason for loyalty. You're incentivized. \n\n&gt;If I don\u2019t see the company is able to help me grow anymore, it\u2019s time to start looking elsewhere\n\nThis part is correct, but you have ambition. If you have ambition you won't stay at a low wage or unfulfilling job. But that's you. What you see time and again people who complain about the bare minimum, and will only do the job within their job description and are satisfied with the low wages, but prefer to continue with that grind and the lifestyle that they are working for.",

Great, you still get paid for 3 hours of work! W-wait, you meant 10, not 1?

For us it's very straightforward, because even if a joist needs to be set off for repair because something was done wrong, we get paid for it when it's repaired, which the vast majority of the time is that day anyways. Also, as long as the inspectors can make their judgement quickly, there's no lost time",

There's millions of people out there who have worked even harder than you ever will in your life, and didn't get lucky enough to work for an employer who actually respects and appreciates them.\n\nAnd that's why you're seeing \"quiet quitting\": *Most employers don't respect their workers any more*. When you dangle a carrot in front of a mule, eventually the mule expects to get the carrot. When you simply never give the mules any carrots, the mules stops chasing carrots. \n\nYou simply got lucky enough to work for an employer who actually feeds you the carrots you were promised. Lucky you. Instead of wagging that fucking finger of yours at people for \"being lazy\", why don't you reflect on how fortunate you are to have an employer who actually shows that they appreciate and respect your hard work?",

I do the bare minimum at each job. Companies don't give out raises or promotions. If they do it's a 3 percent raise, which is absolutely nothing, and it's 1 promotion between 200 employees. It's not worth killing yourself for these companies when moving to a new one for a raise is so much better.",

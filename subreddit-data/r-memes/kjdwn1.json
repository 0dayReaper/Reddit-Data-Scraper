They\u2019re preparing new characters. Not a reboot, just another world and universe taking place in the year 3117. This new 3117 chapter is about these characters exploring what was once the man\u2019s planet. Trust me it sounds like a shit beginning but it gets better on. And for the sake of being a story teller, they\u2019ll let me live eternally to tell the story of how mankind had ended and how I spent my last years on earth making bullshit stories and didn\u2019t lose my virginity \ud83d\ude0e goodbye mortal virgins",

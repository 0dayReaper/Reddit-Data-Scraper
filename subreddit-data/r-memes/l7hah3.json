It paid off, and those funds are stuck having to spend huge money to buy those stocks at a massively inflated price now. The prices rose so high it could actually bankrupt them, and they are legitimately obligated to buy the shares no matter what.  \nIn response, many brokerage firms appear to have very clearly colluded with them to now prevent any more lowly plebeians from buying in, illegally manipulating the markets to save those incompetent gamblers from bankruptcy.",

Hedge funds short companies that are going out of business to make money but when everyone buys the stocks that they shorted they have to buy the stocks back at higher prices.  Just about everyone buying GameStop or AMC at these prices is probably going to lose their money, but for now, the price is way up.",

My fatger used to work as a broker, and he says sometimes big mistakes/disasters like this make the executives and other hedge fund employees more valuable, because they acquired experience from the failure. That was some time ago and only anecdotal, but even if they don't come out more valuable, I think connections with powerful friends could help them get a good position (because imagine if they could only have one sports car).",

A cow, for example, survives by eating grass all day, since they possess a simpler animal mindset. However, a human being wouldn't be able to use that method effectively, as the amount of time it would take to consume said grass exceeds the singular day it would power us for, so we eat the cow instead, as they've already farmed up all of that energy for us and stored it away in their meat.\n\nIn other words, assuming that an alien civilization with lightspeed capabilities or greater were to visit Earth, they'd likely need to consume a rather large amount of energy to keep *themselves* going, and by that logic, well... let's just say that the cow's probably not going to cut it for them.",

In 2015, news media cited the episode as a foreshadowing of Trump's future run for president;[17] the episode was produced during Trump's 2000 third-party run.\n\nEdit: I love the Simpson's, but I don't remember this Trump reference at all, and don't remember much about the episode. This came from Wikipedia\n[Bart to the Future](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_to_the_Future)",

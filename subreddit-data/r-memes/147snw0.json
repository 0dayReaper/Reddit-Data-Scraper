Most people probably use reddit on the web or the reddit app.  Reddit is going to look after its bottom line and not give two toots about the vagabonds that aren't making it any money.  Half of those will probably switch to the actual app/site so that they can continue in their communities.  Most of the people that are going silent or protesting will return to their karma farms in a few days because it is what they do.",

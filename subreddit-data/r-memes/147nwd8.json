He likely came very close to that line arcing over turning him into human jerky. And then he woul fall and be concrete splatter. This is one of the dumbest stunts ever.  \nNever climb on top of train cars on an electrified rail. Even if that train itself isnt electric, that doesnt mean the line isnt live. Even if the rail is not in use and the train cars have been rusting there for years, the line is still likely live.",

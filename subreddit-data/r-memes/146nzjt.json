The knowledge the average 3rd grader has compared to when previous generations where in the same grade is insane. I think within a few more generations we will begin to see the world and it\u2019s people as one entity. The ones that don\u2019t see it this way will be outliers and the minority. I\u2019m not naive enough to say that there will be world peace. As long a human nature and ego exists, there will be conflict.

The economy is atrocious,  the government is full of yes men , abortion is being banned, child labor is back in the United states. \n\nSeems like a totally good idea , I bet that child is going to be thriving with my minimum wage job , we can eat little Cesar's on a daily basis because that's a healthy way to raise a kid right?\n\nOr you can get your head out of your ass and admit that raising a kid takes so much out of a parent . So much so that many people believe they aren't able to provide a happy home life for their child. It may have been different when housing was 1500 dollars and you can buy a full cart of groceries for 10 dollars but that's not today's world .",

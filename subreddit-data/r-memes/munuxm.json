A blue tint can make a place feel sterile and depressing, like a hospital or a boring office building. Red/orange can be used to make a scene feel dangerous and dramatic, or romantic and nostalgic (because of the association with old photos). Or they can just be used to make a place feel very cold or hot. Or you can do like David Lynch and make everything baby blue in one scene for no reason at all, no one will question you because you're David Lynch.",

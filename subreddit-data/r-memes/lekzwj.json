So if they had recorded a reference film of a bit walking up a hill, they would pull that film out anytime it was needed. You can see this with some of the other animated classics, like the dance scene in Robin Hood.",

For instance, the light sabres from the original Star Wars movies were rotoscoped by hand every frame. Wires and other safety equipment has been painted out since the very beginning. The term still gets used in digital VFX, for example when a VFX artist uses masks or a brush tool to paint in/out/over frames manually - like photoshop but frame by frame. Very time consuming and a detail focused job, but is the only way to accomplish certain tasks like painting out wires or a green screen prop and replacing the background.",

Renaissance is still top tier IMO. Unlike most \"ages\" of Disney movies, every single one was a banger.",

After Walt died in 1966 and his brother Roy in 1971, the new executives kinda ignored the animation and imagineering departments, and there was a big issue with \"do what we think Walt would want\" vs \"be bold and creative (which is what Walt would actually want)\". Took until Jeffrey Katzenberger was in charge of Animation and Eisner was the CEO of Disney to bring the studio (and the parks too) back to its former glory",

When it did save time and money, it wasn't much and that time and money + more was just wasted trying to trace other scenes to ultimately scrap and do from scratch because it doesn't work in the new project. It's funny because a lot of animators assumed they did this so they could save time and money and only the higher up animators knew it didn't. People don't know why they still deciding to do this but I think they started to save time and budget, didn't work but continued to do it because \"that's what we do now.\"",

The conclusion should be the same either way, it was really close and therefore they shouldn't have done it. Saving a tiny amount of money/time and having to reuse a scene is worse for the movie and worse for creativity in general.",

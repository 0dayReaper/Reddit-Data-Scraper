Depending on the size of the course you then spend 10-20 minutes answering the question in as much detail as possible, give real world applications for the topic(theory/method) and include one or more additional relevant theories or methods from the syllabus. Then it's a free form conversation for 10-20 minutes.\n\nNo guessing, no cheating, but you have the opportunity to prepare for every question, and structure your presentation. \n\nMultiple choice, or written tests have always weirded me out.",

BMEs are the jack-of-all-trades engineers that simultaneously aren't quite \"real\" engineers.\n\nUnless you manage to find a job in one of the handful of highly specialized domains like tissue, BMEs are basically just worse versions of other engineers (in the eyes of a lot of companies). Med device company wants a material specialist they'll go for a material science engineer over the biomaterials BME; company wants a mechanical specialist they'll go for the MechE over the biomechanics BME. BMEs understand the body, but you don't really need that for engineering a med device (weird as that is to say) because once you're past the initial understanding there's not much added value.",

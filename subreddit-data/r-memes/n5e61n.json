Not to mention I don't think people realised how fucking badass it was to see that in live action for the first time. Yes the story was complete toss and the overemphasis on the human characters was equally toss, but the inner kids in us that watched Transformers growing up didn't care, seeing Optimus transform on screen in front of us was fucking epic.",

And while I personally never really got super into Transformers except for loving the first three films, I still appreciate the G1 Transformers and everything else out there for existing. And for some people, maybe it led to a whole new community who love Transformers.",

ILM revolutionized the industry again in 1993 with Spielberg\u2019s Jurassic Park, introducing CGI as a viable alternative to animatronics, miniatures, stop motion, and motion control photography. They are credited, in whole or in part, on nearly every memorable effects-heavy film of the 80\u2019s/90\u2019s/2000\u2019s and are still today *the* premiere effects house in the film industry.

By the time I got to the action scenes I was already done. I really only watch that movie for the action scenes. 1 and 3 are still really good, both story and action wise (even tho I could barely see anything in 3 where the explosions happen every 2 goddamn seconds, yet it\u2019s more enjoyable than 4 and 5. **ESPECIALLY** 5)",

The difference is that you describe your document with a special description/programming language and the LaTeX tools assemble the document according to these rules. This might sound hard, but this very comment box on reddit uses the same (but simpler) idiom with another such markup language (Markdown). For me personally LaTeX shines with a *huge* amount of packages that solve almost every problem with a few commands. But sure, it requires a bit of \"mastery\" (on the other hand Word does, too). In the end its just a matter of preference (and sure also a bit of ideology\u2026).",

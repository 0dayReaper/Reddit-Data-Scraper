Also is one notion for why we _shouldnt_ allow placebos to be sold. There's an incentive to make it as expensive as possible. \n\nAlso placebos can work even if know know it's a placebo. I think you might have to know that placebos can work even of they're placebos. Sorta like placeboception. Humans are fucking weird.",

It's absurd that people interpret it the other way around.\n\nMore info: the surgery also came with weeks of physiotherapy - the placebo surgery was so that they could compare the effect of the surgery, not the subsequent physiotherapy. As there was no significant difference between the groups (but there was an improvement, which can be attributed to things like physiotherapy and pain medication), it should be concluded that the surgery didn't work.",

So it depends where I'm from whether what you say is correct.\n\nIs it true that they can still work if you know it's a placebo? Like I can imagine maybe you need to give your general consent to the usage of placebos before the doctor is allowed to use them (as in you consent at a random point in time when nothing is wrong with you, and some years later the doctor finally decides to apply a placebo). But if you specifically know that the pill you are about to receive is a placebo, how can it still have an effect?",

It could be positive or negative, and I ended up using it to notice myself getting stressed/angry when driving.\n\nThe *placebo* in this case is you brain feeling better when you think about pressing the button, without having to take a pill. This idea was inspired by how religious people can tap into positivity through their practices, but as a humanists i wanted a secular option.",

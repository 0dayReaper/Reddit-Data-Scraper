Gunpowder contains its own oxidizer. \n\nNot to mention, they fire without air on earth too, as they are sealed in a barrel.\n\nThe only issues might come in the form of cycling. Because a regular gun action is designed to work in atmosphere, removing the atmosphere may make the gun more prone to slamming and jamming. (edit - It would not have the internal 'air cushioning' effect on the action like it would in atmosphere, so many guns I suspect the bolt would slam into the back of the receiver much harder then normal)",

At most, without atmosphere, the pistol will cycle slightly harder than normal. \n\nThe bigger issue, rather than lack of gravity or lack of atmospheric pressure, would be temperature. In the shade, extreme cold might cause the lubricants of the gun to harden, and the gunpowder or primer may not function as normal. In the sun, extreme heat might cause ammo to detonate prematurely, and with a plastic-handled gun (like the Glock in the picture) the plastic might even begin to melt.",

                                    "comment": "I was curious so I decided to do the math. All these calculations are based on a Glock 17. The muzzle speed of a Glock 17 is 375 m/s, and a 9mm bullet weighs 7.0 to 8.3 grams (I'll use 8.3 to give the Glock as much recoil as possible). That means the momentum of the bullet will be 3.1125 kg m/s. Since momentum is conserved, all of that should transfer in the opposite direction to the gun, spacesuit, and astronaut. An average human has a mass of 62 kg (seems low to me, but a larger mass is going to reduce the speed further). As for the mass of a space suit, I've found a lot of conflicting answers so I'll use 127 kg which is what NASA says. So dividing the momentum by the combined mass of our astronaut and space suit gives us a speed of...\n\n0.0165 m/s, 0.0594 km/h, or 0.0369 mph. In other words, you're not going to die. You're going to barely move.",

How its orbit will look like depends on the speed and trajectory of the gun and the orientation of the gun when the bullet was shot. In the case of the meme, earth seems kinda far away, so the bullet will change the orbital average altitude a bit but not much.",

We probably have a few more decades before the earth becomes flat again.",

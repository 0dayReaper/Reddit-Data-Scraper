Yes volcanos release less carbon on average because eruptions are not regular events. But they do happen. And unlike people they mostly release Sulfur-Dioxide and Hydrogen Flouride.\n\nWhich are not only poisonous but also contribute to over all acidity increase of various climates.\n\nWhich can negatively affect crops, water tables, and overall population health within months of an eruption event.\n\nBut yes. Keep thinking us tiny people have some semblance of control over our climate instead of being at the whim of the fucking molten inside of the earth deciding it wants to be on the outside that day.\n\nYou. Have. No. Control. \n\nNone. Of. Us. Do.",

Also allow me to remind you that those 3rd world countrys arent the only ones poluting. Places like China and Japan(not so sure about Japan tho) polute loads despite being advanced. Also for the countryes that aint advanced its ussually companies from other countryes doing the poluting in those countryes because of exploitable resources. These companyes also enforce completly bs work to pay ratios that end up makin life worse for most of the people there. If we can force those companyes to give better pay and tone down the exploitation we can make it so these countryes suffer as little as possible while minimizing polution. However none of these will happen without significant action. If we want to save the planet wed have to start now",

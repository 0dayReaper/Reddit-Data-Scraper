The most vivid instance I had there was a boy with his childish laughter, almost a sinister giggle, off in the distance. The whole incident had metallic rattling like aluminum cans tumbling in a mild twister that itself was a thunderous noise. That noise only grew as the child drew closer to me.    \n    \nI slept that night on the right side of the bed with one knee sticking slightly over the edge and I could feel the boy running his finger along my knee for a second. His laughter continued until the rattling slowed. The boy disappeared by the time the noise went away and I could finally move again.    \n    \nOther times it's something like dogs (little Chihuahuas) barking up the side of my bed.",

Ill often get sleep paralysis without the night terrors, but ill keep thinking I'm awake, and then suddenly waking up. Each time, I can't move. At some point I could finally move, and I hear voices across the house (I was alone). I walk across the house and go into my office, where I heard voices. I open the door and both of my dogs are standing on their hind legs talking to eachother. My German shepherd - corgi mix turns and makes eye contact and says \"go back to sleep\". I woke up startled wrapped in sheets on the floor, I'd fallen off the bed.",

On the other  hand, you can have 0 formal training and a godlike portfolio, and companies will give you contracts halfway across the world.\n\n***Fine art*** seems to be a social game where being in style or having an audience is more important than basically anything else. You don't really have to be mechanically good at anything to make a statement or catch eyes but it does help. There are artists out there who do high school level art making money because they've acquired a massive following, and there's nothing wrong with that. The artist is happy, the customer is happy, no one is getting hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, at least for commercial artists, if you aren't training with the same dedication and mindset that an athlete does, you aren't going anywhere.",

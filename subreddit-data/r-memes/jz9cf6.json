But of course you cannot run away from your problems. And sure enough, the past comes back to haunt you and you have to face everything you swept under the rug long time ago.\n\nNow, you could debate whether or not how Simba faced the problem in the end was the right course of action. But Timon and Pumbaa play a role in the plot and I wouldn't change them in any way. They perfectly encapsulate the way so many people I know handle problems.",

He *thinks* his uncle killed his father, but he doesn't know; the indecision drives him mad until he destroys his entire life trying to find a way out. It's a portrait of psychological unraveling.\n\n*The Lion King* is about Simba witnessing his father's death and fleeing. After a sojourn in the wilderness, he heeds the call of duty and returns to topple his tyrannical usurper uncle. It's a straightforward hero's journey.\n\nThese plots have almost nothing in common except that a king gets killed to set them up.",

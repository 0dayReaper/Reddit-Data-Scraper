But then he was going through a divorce and honestly that man looked so broken near the end of the year but the whole staff gave him a party for the end of the year and I never saw him so happy. I dont know what happened to him afterwards but I know he's still teaching in primary school.\n\nEdit: wow this is insane, and I will try to contact them because honestly they deserve this love\n\nEdit 2: Finally contacted them and we had a chat, he is happily retired and remarried and is happy that you guys sent so much kindness his way",

He thanked me for being nice to him and treating him like a person unlike most of the other students. He brought up the time that I defended him in front of a big group of classmates about his hobbies (drawing and computer games) and how he was planning on killing himself since he thought everyone hated him. He also had a shitty home life, lots of bullies, and had aspergers syndrome. \n\nIt looks like his life is going great now and he has his own family.\n\nI had sort of forgotten that whole situation since it was so long ago, but it was really nice to hear that I was able to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if I was kind of a loser in high school too.",

He ended up shooting himself and I was heartbroken.  I still remember the last time I saw him and he asked how my calc was - I was still flunking it but since he had made such an effort I lied and said my grades had turned around.",

Generally though most parents wouldn't even donate $5 to fund the parties and my wife would usually pay for the whole thing. We live in an upper middle class neighborhood, I'm sure the vast majority of people could've afforded $5 but they never would.",

My town is considered poor compared to the town we border but we're definitely upper middle, median home price is somewhere close to $400k, and median income is something like $175k household.\n\nI think state funding would be great, but I want to see the poorer areas be increased and the more well off areas stay steady. I pay a shit load of taxes to have my kids well educated and I don't want them to be handicapped to meet some arbitrary common ground. Bring everyone up to the higher standards rather than lower the standards across the board. I also think teaching should be a 6 figure job not $50-60k or much less depending on district.",

Those two other kids swapped homework and signed each other\u2019s.\n\nSure enough, the talented kid still got an A and the other kid still got a D.

If y'all had been in the class doing assignments for that long it probably wasn't hard to figure out. \n\nBut I feel ya, I had an art teacher when I was in 2nd grade erase a self portrait I'd done while standing overtop of me telling me how I'd done it all \"wrong\".

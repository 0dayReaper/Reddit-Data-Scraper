It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and as if life was passing by when your head is stuck in textbooks/lectures, and you won\u2019t have ample time to do hobbies that you enjoy. But strive to make time for yourself so that you don\u2019t burnout. Dentistry is one of the greatest careers for helping others, having an excellent work life balance and the ability to support your family without concerns week to week. Enjoy and good luck!",

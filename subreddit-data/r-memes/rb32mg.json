They need to do one thing really well, and the designers want to be as confident as possible that it'll do it correctly and safely.\n\nThe former means you don't need as much compute power, and the latter basically forces you to keep the software as absolutely simple as possible (which also means you don't need as much compute power). For example, the space shuttle computers can't even handle the year rolling over. There were a few instances where NASA changed their plans, even cutting missions short, just to avoid being in space on Dec 31/Jan 1.",

Between the lack of real opponents and the doctrine of overwhelming airb superiority enforced in pay through sheer numbers, there aren't many targets to go around.\n\nThe last known fighter ace crowns likely went to avpilot in the Iran-Iraq War. Neither side could achieve air superiority and they shot down dozens of each other's aircraft. Iran had at least a dozen aces, while the number of Iraqi access isn't clear. The war ended in 1988, so it's been more than 30 years since an ace was crowned anywhere.",

The software that took us to the moon was very specialized and the math it had to do quite simple.",

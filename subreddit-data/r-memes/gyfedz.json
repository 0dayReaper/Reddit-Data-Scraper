One thing I always wondered was 'But who is benefiting from spreading the \"globe earth lies\"?'.\n\nBasically they're anti-science because they see science as the removal of god. That's the 'why', an evil plot to explain away God. \n\n If you believe in evolution, then there's no room for god (there is, just not in their view) to have made man in his image. If you believe the earth is round and made through various astronomical processes, then God didn't make earth specially for humans.\n\nSo Flat Earth etc is them refuting science because they want to believe God did it.",

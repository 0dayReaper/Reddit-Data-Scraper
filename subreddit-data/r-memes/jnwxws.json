Eventually he realized I knew what I was doing (I never said anything), so he started looking at me to confirm, especially if two boys had different answers. \n\nMy pre calculus teacher told my parents in parent-teacher conferences that he would look at my paper to make sure *he* was right. \n\nComforting to know I wasn't being called on to make sure I was paying attention, or really as a test on any level.

There was always this one guy who was always first to raise his hand.  Anyway I started to see if I could actually match his speed, just for the hell of it, and I actually raised my hand first for once.  That guy put on quite the deadly glare when I did, and others looked simply amazed.  Anyway the teacher (no doubt expecting I had made a mistake) asked me (shy person) to write the solution on the board for everyone to see.  Yes, that is quite correct the embarrassed (no doubt sexist) teacher said and I sat down.  He obviously expected I had made some mistake.  No one said a word.  I never did that again in case there was another performance required though, and the guy would often glance over at me to see if I had beaten him after lol.",

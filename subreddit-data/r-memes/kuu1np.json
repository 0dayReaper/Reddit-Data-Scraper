The British East India company (this company had a monopoly on foreign luxury goods imported into Britain) went heavily into opium only after China refused to trade tea for manufactured goods, as they historically had, countering that they will only accept sterling silver in exchange for tea going forward. Tea had become a central part of British society, and they were not having it, so they begun to export opium from India to China, which is what started to opium wars......\n\nSpices such as saffron were sometimes more valuable than gold, let alone opium, seeing as you can grow opium in Europe,  but you could not grow many of the spices from India anywhere else, as far as they knew back then.",

Meanwhile I love spicy food and experimenting with seasoning in cooking; the difference there? I've pretty much always had access to whatever types of food I wanted so developed a wider palate over time, a luxury my parents didn't always have.",

Still traditional cooking with ingredients and spices from the areas certainly exists. \n\nThe often missed thing for me is that even \"Indian food\" varies hugely just like southern cooking in the US compared to other regions. Heck in the US we even have pizza styles and microcosms for that one dish. \n\nStill in most countries there's an export version of food that has broader appeal and the more traditional dishes and spice levels.

And even in that picture, there is probably at least some Worcestershire sauce cooked With the beans, which is pretty heavy on the spices. But mostly in deserts, where you see tons of spices.",

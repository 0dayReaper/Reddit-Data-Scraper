So I said fine. I opened the account, got my loan. Fast forward a year, they introduce fees but never inform me. I don't look at that account because it just has $20. Fast forward 6 more months and they close the account because it has no money.\n\nOther companies provide services which provide value. Banks exist only to fuck you and provide nothing.",

The guy is very rich apparently, there's oil under the 30k+ acres of land he owns in the area, and the auction was to benefit a charity that helps the families of fallen officers.   \n   \nSo there were probably one or two very well off people besides the guy with the winning bid there using the auction just to donate money to the charity and simultaneously help the kid out by giving him the car. And they most likely drove the price up bidding against each other to get to be the one to do it. \n\nhttps://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/05/19/man-who-gave-son-of-fallen-deputy-his-dads-car-always-felt-the-need-to-give-back/",

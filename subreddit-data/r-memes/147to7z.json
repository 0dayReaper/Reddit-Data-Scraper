Many of these are beloved, help Redditors view content, are bots that help clean up spam, etc.\n\nThey claim they are just charging fees to help cover the costs, but the amount they are charging to all 3rd party apps, some mod bots, etc, are over **10 times** the amount of comparable services and over **20 times** how much they make per user. This is Reddit trying to play up being reasonable, but make no mistake, it's not true.\n\nReddit's decision adversely impacts everyone on the site, Reddit itself (as third party apps are more efficient than the official one), community members (who view and submit content to Reddit using 3rd party apps), and moderators (who need free API access to help make sure communities are free from spam and inauthentic or manipulated content). [See this thread for more information on why the protest is happening.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/)\n\n# What is /r/memes doing?\n\nWe are restricting the subreddit to a single image, effective immediately.\n\n**Effective immediately, we will only allow submissions to this image (all other submissions will be automatically removed):**\n\n**https://i.redd.it/irnk8oulom5b1.png**",

I definitely didn't love the idea of it, even though there's nothing of any consequence.  Photos, personal documents, etc... are things I sometimes like to keep to myself and while I wouldn't argue against it, it would bother me.  \n\nMy fear comes from the other bits of authority that  border agents possess.  Discretionary deferrals.  If it's a process to get a warrant and I say \"I'm not really comfortable with just handing it over without a warrant or cause\", well, it's just as easy for them to say turn around and stay out.  As a foreign national, I don't share the same rights to entry as a citizen, so this could be significantly more impactful for someone like myself.  \n\nUnfortunately, even with guidance from the courts on exclusion based on refusal, it's within an agents authority to defer entry due to \"evasive behaviours\" or \"non cooperation with screening process\", which are near impossible to fight.  \n\nIt's definitely a win for Citizens, but the status quo will likely remain for us foreigners.",

If it requires a warrant to search it, it is required regardless of nationality. The problem is CBPE are allowed to deny entry for any or no reason. This means if you refuse to allow your phone to be searched, you will be placed on the next flight to your home country. \n\nThey would have to pass a law that does not allow the government to ask to search phones.

Most of the time the CBSA seem just to be doing their jobs and duties, something about USCBP makes it seem like they are making a show of it.",

I carry my law license with me in case I need to exert privilege over electronics or files I carry with me, but some bored Joe Schmoe officer can totally ignore it.\n\nI delete my work email app from my phone when I cross the border now. No files are stored on my laptop, it's all on a server that requires I connect to via a password protected VPN, so nothing privileged can be found by searching the computer.",

It just feels like yet another step toward security theatre that most people voting for these invasive policies rarely experience.\n\nEvery time I have to take off my belt, shoes, dump my electronics or other metallic items into a bin, etc. I'm reminded of how much terrorism has won. If stripping down like this isn't terrorism winning by definition, I don't know what is. It's statistically unlikely -- and I don't attribute that to these precautions -- to be involved in a terrorist attack in cross border/air travel so having our independence and privacy violated seems decidedly convenient to law enforcement to exercise additional controls just in case. Meanwhile, visible minorities seem to experience extremely invasive procedures and delays and I'm more likely to be assaulted by someone stuck alongside me in slow ques or in a confined space who is either outraged at the process, lack of service, or who has had too much to drink. Perhaps those are worth fixing first?\n\nAnd no, I don't even have anything to hide... it's just degrading and embarrasses or delays fellow travelers.",

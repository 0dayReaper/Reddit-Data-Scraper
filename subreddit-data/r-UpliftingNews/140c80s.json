The police channel all 911 calls from that area to the civilians. Unless there is a major incident or a victim demands an arrest, officers, always in plainclothes, shadow the workers. \n\nThe civilians have no arrest powers. But they have persuaded people to turn in illegal guns, prevented shoplifting, kept a man from robbing a bodega and stopped a pregnant woman from hitting a boyfriend who had not bought a car seat and a stroller as he had promised.\r  \n\r  \nThey are part of the Brownsville Safety Alliance, a group of neighborhood and city groups, police officers and members of the Kings County District Attorney\u2019s office that is trying to ensure that fewer people are arrested and entangled in the criminal justice system. \"\n\n...\n\n\" The Safety Alliance has been thriving amid a positive trend in the 73rd Precinct, Mr. Gonzalez said. In the first half of 2023, homicides fell 50 percent, shootings fell 25 percent and the rate of grand larcenies of automobiles also fell even at it rose in other neighborhoods, he said. \"\n\n...\n\n\" \rThe Brownsville initiative is part of a movement called the \u201ccommunity responder model,\u201d which aims to reduce the use of armed officers to handle many calls.\r  \n\r  \nSimilar programs are underway in Eugene, Ore.; Denver; and Rochester, N.Y., among other places, according to the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. The group has estimated that almost 40 percent of calls to police could be handled by community responders. \"\n\n\r  \n...\n\nHere's an example of one member of the Safety Alliance:\n\n\" Mr. Almond, 47, a former gang member who spent more than 13 years in prison for a bank robbery. His past, along with his calm, straightforward approach, helps him navigate conflicts. During one Safety Alliance week, he persuaded a man going into a bodega with a gun to give him his weapon and go home. The next day, that same man returned, but this time to volunteer.\r  \n\r  \nHe spent the day \u201csquashing beefs,\u201d Mr. Almond said. \u201cHe broke up like three fights.\u201d \"",

The three interpretations are:  \n\n * (1)  Reform the police.  \n * (2)  Tear down and rebuild the police.  \n * (3)  Get rid of the police entirely.\n\nThat last one seems like a strawman, but it's taken *much* more seriously than that:  \n&gt; \"This as-advertised view of the rallying cry, while perhaps the most farfetched in the modern political climate, is also the most deeply rooted, with an intellectual history and framework that\u2019s been developing over decades.\"",

Because I've seen so many signs at rallies and protests that say \"defund the police.\" Conservative media definitely amplifies those voices, but many progressives have also coopted them as well. I feel like ultimately a lot of the left wing is too earnest to understand that you can't be straight forward in politics and expect people will be rational and listen to what you have to say after. I also feel like they're betting too heavily on younger generations becoming more progressive and replacing the older generations rather than changing the discourse of politics today and getting moderates and blue collar folks to understand what they're dishing out.",

Instead they basically chose to say \"ban the scary thing!\"\n\nTurns out the left is just as emotionally driven as the right, only somehow even less competent.

What's not going to help is doing the 1,238th short term, limited participant study. This isn't a laboratory, you don't get a double blind decade long study in politics/economics. It's past time to just do it already. The math works and the psychology works as best as we can tell. Doubting and saying we need more study at this point is purely obstructionist.",

If we gave everyone $10,000/year that would be $3 trillion which is like 80% of our tax revenue. We would have to increase our taxes on high earnings (which I'm ok with) but exactly how much would we have to increase it and does that even make sense? I've heard that UBI would cut a lot of other programs but would that actually help or hurt people? Is that $10k suppose to cover medical as well because if it is that would not be enough for sure and if it is not suppose then we are going to need WAY more tax revenue. Also there are people like my mom who probably get more than $10k worth of benefits each year who would be losing money if they took it. If you are already getting more than $10k/tear so you decide not to take it then it really isn't improving the life of the people who really need it. My mom would be in the exact same spot she is now but I, a person who makes $100k+ would be $10k richer. \n\nAll the articles I find on the subject don't really talk a out exactly how it would work. I have not found any math on it aside from people saying it would cost way to much.",

It was like an outdoor art show with people providing free food and planting food gardens in the park. I walked through there a lot. It was really interesting.\n\nSecond week though, it became the homebase of every right-wing troublemaker, all of Seattle's homeless, and drug dealers, basically people interested in a lawless space where they won't be harassed and they all traveled from states away to be there. It was a failure in a tragedy of the commons way. No two block radius can support that kind of national attention, no matter how well intentioned and self-policing the original participants were. I stopped visiting once people showed up with guns to \"protect\" the area. That escalated quickly and predictably until people died.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'd almost take the tragedy it turned into over our cops. It's hard to emphasize enough how monstrous our cops were in the months leading up to CHAZ. They full on rioted so many times, pepper gassing our neighborhoods because marchers dared to chant things that hurt their feelings. They escalated every situation so they could hurt people. Just monstrous.",

They're more difficult to get set up in urban environments because there's just so much that goes on it's hard to organize. \n\nWith government funding and a proper support network like was described here it's more viable. This is less of a \"removing the police\" type of deal and more of a \"try and encourage the community to act like a community and take care of their own simple problems\" situation. A proof of concept for future projects like it.\n\nThe biggest issue though, is calls where bad info is given.

(You've also posted some really sexiest, racist and borderline ethnonationalist comments, too... yikes. No, being Native American doesn't make you \"immune to pepper spray\" because of spicy food.). \n\nFor anyone else reading this: None of the shootings were definitively connected to the protests, and the government was later sued for illegally deleting thousands of text messages about their efforts to clear the zone. A federal judge ruled in plaintiff's favor - ie, confirming that the government broke the law. \n\nFor all we know, the shootings were themselves the results of the ongoing efforts by the police and government to undermine the zone. There's lots of documented evidence of police using false flag operations to undermine protests in June 2020 across the country, so it's pretty plausible that this happened in Seattle too. \n\nNot to mention that police don't prevent shootings from happening anyway, so it's not clear that anything would have been different had there been a police presence.",

My grandfather was a \"peace officer\" (I think through the sheriff's office) and when a call came in for a drunk and disorderly, domestic disputes, etc. he was sent in unarmed with a partner to deescalate the situation and provide solutions to the dispute.  He very rarely had to call in for police back-up. He LOVED the job and was very good at it - he was originally from a rough section of Brooklyn, NY and was a very successful and charismatic salesman before he moved to FL - attributes that I'm sure helped him with the job.  It's a shame they did away with the program but I guess that's Florida for you.",

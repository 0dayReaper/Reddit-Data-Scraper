HIV and syphilis.\n\nSyphilis is relatively immediately obvious and easily curable if noticed. It's... not a non-issue, necessarily, but not really worth worrying about in this context.\n\nHIV, meanwhile, is much nastier, but medications for it have gotten to the point where someone who's been on meds for long enough is incapable of transmitting it to others. Someone who's HIV-positive and undetectable could theoretically donate blood, no problem, without anyone even noticing anything amiss, let alone catching HIV from it.\n\nSo... realistically, this leaves the only remaining problem group as \"people who have HIV and aren't aware they have it,\" which is a rapidly shrinking group.",

Since your closet isn't infinite, people occasionally come by to bring you more meals to replenish your closet. But there's a 1% chance that one of the people who brings you more meals has poisoned the meals they bring. You know that this happens, because you can test the meals, but only after they've been put in your closet.\n\nAlso, you don't like the way one of those people looks, so you always refuse the meals that that person brings. You still allow anyone else to replenish your meals, though. You tell everybody that that person you don't like the look of is the one who is poisoning your meals, but you don't know that for sure because you can only test for poison after the meals are already in your closet. Other people in town will still allow that person to replenish their closets, and they don't seem to be getting any more poisoned meals than you are.\n\nNow the meteor hits. Some of the other people who used to bring you meals have died in the meteor strike, so the rate of meals being brought to your closet drops below three per day. You need to keep eating three meals a day, though, so you loudly declare that, from now on, you'll start accepting meals from that person who you don't like the look of, so that you can have enough food to eat. You tell all of your neighbors that this is because that person has finally stopped poisoning all of the meals they give out, but you forgot that those neighbors have already been allowing that person to bring them food for years.

So much of the AIDS epidemic has faded from recent memory, but at the time, various blood-sourced treatments (like Factor VIII for hemophiliacs) were created by pooling 1000s of donated blood samples together. A single infected donation infected the entire pool. Back then, roughly 50% of all hemophiliacs and 90% of those with severe hemophilia were infected with HIV, and back then HIV was basically a 4-10 year death sentence. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated\\_haemophilia\\_blood\\_products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products))\n\n([https://www.ihtc.org/hemophilia-HIV](https://www.ihtc.org/hemophilia-HIV))\n\nMedicine has improved, including better screening and synthetic versions, so like you said, the risk assessment is ~~likely~~ outdated. However, the 80s were only 40 years ago. Scientists in their prime then are just starting to age and die now. Knowing your screening processes led to the deaths of LITERAL thousands is bound to make people hesitant to reverse course.\n\nIt's not simply discrimination for discrimination's sake.",

Since then, there are new blood tests, testing is cheaper, and the risks associated with contracting HIV are lower for the person who gets the disease, i.e. it's no longer a death sentence, but a chronic condition. \n\nThe change during the Obama administration was based on a calculation that with a 1-year wait, approximately 1 person would catch HIV from the blood supply every year, though there's no indication I can find that anyone ever did.",

Blood is tested in batches due to the expense of testing, with multiple people being mixed into the tested sample. If a single donor has a disease, it stops the batch. STDs are more often transmitted through anal due to microtears in the rectum. This, coupled with increased anal frequency in the men-with-men community specifically means that certain diseases are much more common in that community. \n\nIt was less expensive to disallow 2-5% of the population to donate than to order individual tests at the increased rate that including them would require. A small increase for single sample failures magnifies during batch testing.",

Men who have had gay sex, since anal penetration is high risk of transmission, statistically showed a risk at a level that did not pass the risk assessment. You can ask all sorts of questions, but you then need to validate those questions show certain results. This is a very difficult area as far as risk assessment goes, and it's not like the blood banks don't want more blood. It's no homophobic, there just happens to be an infection that is disproportionately transmissible in a certain type of sex. That's it. The data, the last I have seen, still showed it to be a high risk group. And I know you can ask all sorts of questions like \" when was the last time\" etc, but those need to be validated to show a decrease in risk, which requires broad panel testing. It's not a lemonade stand, there are a lot of regulation, testing, risk assessments, etc that go into it. At no point is there a homophobia coefficient for the risk assessment. They are not using 1980's data.",

Epidemiologists looked at female prostitutes in SF in the 1980s, to see if they had similar levels of transmission, but they didn't. As this Stanford medicine study puts it:\n\n&gt;Anal sex  \nA meta-analysis exploring the risk of HIV transmission through unprotected anal sex was published in 2010. The analysis, based on the results of four studies, estimated **the risk through** **receptive anal sex (receiving the penis into the anus, also known as bottoming) to be 1.4%. (This means that an average of one transmission occurred for every 71 exposures.)** This risk was similar regardless of whether the receptive partner was a man or woman.  \nNo meta-analysis estimates currently exist for insertive anal sex (inserting the penis into the anus, also known as topping) but two individual studies were conducted to calculate this risk. The first, published in 1999, calculated the risk to be 0.06% (equivalent to one transmission per 1,667 exposures). However, due to the design of the study, this number likely underestimated the risk of HIV transmission. **The second study, published in 2010, was better designed and estimated the risk to be 0.11% (or 1 transmission per 909 exposures) for circumcised men and 0.62% (1 transmission per 161 exposures) for uncircumcised men.**  \nVaginal sex  \nA meta-analysis of 10 studies exploring the risk of transmission through vaginal sex was published in 2009. It is estimated the **risk of HIV transmission through receptive vaginal sex (receiving the penis in the vagina) to be 0.08% (equivalent to 1 transmission per 1,250 exposures)**.  \nA meta-analysis of three studies exploring **the risk from insertive vaginal sex (inserting the penis into the vagina) was estimated to be 0.04% (equivalent to 1 transmission per 2,500 exposures)**.",

If I had come out as a trans man first, I would have technically been in a gay relationship, even though my sexual partner had not changed,  and thus excluded from donating blood unless I decided to not have sex for a few months. But since my wife came our first, we were in a \"lesbian\" relationship according to their definitions before I came out.  Now we're back to \"straight.\" Neither lesbians nor straight people have restrictions like gay people.  But what's dumb is that in both scenarios, my partner never changed.

We've had the means to test all blood product for HIV since 1984 and still do for all blood, regardless of origin. We do batch testing with a small amount of several samples pooled together. This also allows the Red Cross/orgs to keep track of other bloodborne diseases. Of course, denying gay men the ability to be tested in this way helps drive down the numbers the Red Cross/org is able to investigate and further stigmatizes it as \"the gay disease\" by making it seem less of an issue than it was.\n\nSource: I am a lab tech, this is what we do\n\nDownvote all you want. Doesn't change history. Perhaps try learning from our mistakes instead of doubling down? Cowards think they have the power to erase the past instead of realizing it will always have been\n\nPS the other long comment obscures the bias by talking about expenses and individual testing, these are both wrong. The expense would be coming from the state, which is already paying out disproportionately for having denied the crisis in the first place allowing it to become endemic, and you don't have to do individual tests unless a batch tests positive, which already happens. Lies by omission.\n\nEdit: for clarification we're talking about adding &lt;7% of the adult population into the pool of potential donors. There are estimated to be about 12.6 people in 100,000 to have HIV (or .0126%). This is for all of the US population. Reagents used to test for it may have been expensive (while getting exponentially cheaper to produce), but you get more than one use out of the bottle. The cost per test is literally insignificant, especially in using it as a means of detection and prevention. Cruelty has always been the point.\n\nhttps://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/laboratorytests.html\nA list of approved tests, some prices are listed on the following websites, but even then, you can buy home test kits that test your saliva for $50, blood tests aren't far off conceptually.

As a heterosexual white guy, I never ran into any issues, but I remember being really surprised at how strict the criteria was, considering there have been heavily advertised, endless donation campaigns as long as I can remember.\n\nI don't know if there's an age limit State side, but in Canada we could donate at 17, and for first time donors you had to be in vaguely defined \"good health\" and at least 110 pounds. \n\nI'll always remember how shocked I was at the questionnaire I had to fill out. From what I remember, beyond \"are you sexually active\" there were no questions regarding heterosexual relations. They basically asked over and over in varying ways if the donor had shot heroin, or had intimate relations with black men, gay men, or men who had been to the African continent within a certain time frame. I understand, that HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmissible things, at one point in time, were disproportionately high in the gay community, and we know the havoc HIV/AIDS among many other viruses, diseases and infections have wrought in Africa. A not-so-nice, but totally reasonable precaution at the time. We've since gotten the tech to work around that, but I was truthfully unaware it was still so restrictive.\n\nI think \"Fine, we'll take your blood because we're running low\" is a super lame reason for the turnaround, but I do think it's still a \"win\", however small it might be.",

            "comment": "First off, glad to see this. Sad that it took a critical shortage for the rules to change, but still glad it happened.\n\nI used to donate blood all the time. I started out when my high school did the Medic blood drive and allowed anyone with parental permission or over 18 to donate. I had turned 18 halfway through my senior year, so I didn't even need the permission slip (not that my parents would have objected anyway). Then, a few years later, during my hoe phase (yes, guys have them too), I slept with a dude. Now, when you go to donate blood, they ask if you have \"had sex with another male since 1968\", and will deny you if you say yes. I have been of the opinion that they should test for HIV/AIDS, then allow the donation if you test negative (which I do), but they have been historically totally inflexible.\n\nI am an example of one of the many folks that would happily donate blood, plasma, or whatever else I can to help people (I am also an organ donor, and have my will structured to basically have any useful organs or tissue donated for transplant or research), but have been prevented from doing so because of a single choice in my younger years. I, for one, am glad to see this outdated and frankly biased rule changed.\n\nFor those who might object to me calling the rule biased, yes, I am aware the AIDS scare was a bad time, but that does not call for a blanket ban on donations from an entire group of the population. The hysteria around the AIDS epidemic was massively inflated thanks to media sensationalism around homosexuality, and the lackluster response in the form of funding and research stems from bias against homosexuality. When the majority of people afflicted are the same group you rail against as \"evil\", motivation to cure the problem is thin. Just look at the reasoning behind Marijuana being classified in the same group as amphetamines to see how a bias against a marginalized group can sway medical research.",

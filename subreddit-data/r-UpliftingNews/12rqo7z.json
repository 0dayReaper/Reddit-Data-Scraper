Heat death of the universe?\n\n&gt;Not to mention I highly doubt CO2 is the only thing we gotta worry about.\n\nFor sure. Greenhouse gasses come in a lot of forms. Methane is way worse, but there's less of it. And the EPA regulates all sorts of things. A lot of stuff is poisonous to us and others. Or causes cancer. Or makes eggshells thin. \n\nWe most certainly already worry about a lot of things in a very well specified and regulated manner. The USA and EU more than others. Welcome to a developed nation.\n\n&gt;Maybe, just maybe, we gotta make some long-term plans ?\n\nMy brother, getting on top of global warming is a VERY long term goal and it will be made by a collection of smaller efforts.\n\nThe \"big plan\" is to improve efficiency. Reduce pollution. Electrify industry. Get green power. Educate and empower women (which lowers birth rates). Investigate new tech like sun shades, carbon capture, aerosols, fusion, and biological agents, which is looking good.\n\nThe risk with people demanding silver bullets is that real legitimate improvements get neglected.",

With widespread degradation of biodiversity hotspots, such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, which goes unrecorded.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

It says that while the world is greening, much of that is due to increased agricultural development and forestry policies, while some is due to greening of previously frozen areas in the tundra due to global warming. Nowhere does it say that this process is causing cooling, only that atmospheric CO2 would be even higher without this phenomenon. It\u2019s basically one more data point to include in global climate models. It should also be noted that the greening of the tundra is also accompanied by huge releases of CO2 and methane that were previously trapped in the permafrost. While greening of these areas will capture a small amount of CO2, it won\u2019t offset the greenhouse gas release by thawing in the first place\u2026.at least not on a human timescale.",

It caused a climate anomaly so massive that 1816 is said to be \"The Year without a Summer\" as global temperatures plummeted due to volcanic ash in the atmosphere.  \nWe did have the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai eruption in 2022 but that's effects weren't as widely felt as Tambora and didn't last as long either.   \n\n\nIf there was any safe way to pop those geological corks to vent volcanic ash into the atmosphere (and it didn't have any other dangerous side effects) it would be a way to mitigate Climate Change. That being said, I don't the best solution is to 'poke holes in earth's crust'. That's technically what got us here in the first place :P",

Like, it'll melt through trees kind of acid rain. I'm not sure what else but, one other upside, is that volcanic ash is amazing for soils and plant growth. It's the reason Hawaii, and other volcanic areas, are so fertile and green. Phosphates, nitrogen and loads of other things get deposited when the ash falls and, assuming it's not too much ash, it'll help the area recover once the volcanism calms back down.",

As a species, we have made an immense investment in fossil fuel based and driven infrastructure built up over in some cases centuries, and the reality is that that simply cannot be turned around and rebuilt in the time we need it to be to prevent catastrophic consequences.\n\nBut, if we had a relatively efficient means by which CO2 could be concentrated from air and sequestered, then the cost of doing so can be factored in to the use of those fuels, and the currently unaccounted for externality that is climate change can be eliminated. With that system in place, and a bit of investment over the top to start reducing atmospheric CO2 rather than just net-zero from fossil fuels, we will have the time we need for the energy mix of the future to become economically viable.",

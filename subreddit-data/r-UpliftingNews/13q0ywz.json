It also uses a much longer wavelength and much lower frequency. The am wavelength is actually 1km to 100m, and the frequency range is 300kHz to 3MHz, though the range used for broadcast radio in the US is 540kHz to 1700 kHz.\n\nFM or \"Frequency Modulation\" changes the frequency of the wave in order to broadcast a radio signal. It uses shorter wavelengths (10m to 1m) and higher frequency (30-300 MHz). The range for broadcast radio in the US is 88.0 MHz to 108.0 MHz. Because FM modulates the frequency each band is 200kHz wide compared to only 10 kHz wide for AM.  \n\nBecause of the differences in how they transmit signals AM travels way further, but FM sounds more clear, especially for music. I have a friend who has a really expensive radio and we picked up cuban radio all the way from South Carolina, which is ~700 miles away. AM can also penetrate much further into buildings, through storm clouds, etc. As a result emergency stations use AM frequencies to broadcast.",

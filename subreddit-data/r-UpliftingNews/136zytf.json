Nice place though.\n\nHe met a nice 93 year old woman, and he was afraid we'd be upset, but we told him he fulfilled his marriage vows, \"till death do us part\" and she was a nice woman. After he died though going through his apartment.\n\nThe porn. The condoms. The lube. The sex toys. I'm into BDSM. I was impressed. Hopefully when I'm 81 or 93, I'll still have someone to tie me up and spank me. Grandpa took that one to the grave!\n\nWe sent Christmas, Easter, birthday, and other occasions, baskets to his Mistress until she passed at 96. We did not help empty her apartment.",

That's like saying your dream is to have potato for dinner; no judgement, but you can dream bigger. Had you been 40, 20 or 10 years ago, nobody would've humiliate or shame you for it. Noone and nothing was/is holding you back. It's why in many cities, there are dozens and dozens of female strip clubs, but having even 1 male strip club (that is not targetted at gay men audience)can be quite rare.  \nBut sure, if that's what you drean of, go ahead. More power to you. There's one across the street, and if you take a cab, you are 5 minutes away from 10 more strip clubs to have a fun night. Are you looking for something more specifics maybe, in terms of ambiance, style, kinks, etc.? Really, it's an open, all-you-can-eat buffet - and in some strip clubs, there's a litteral all-you-can-eat buffet you can enjoy while watching the female performer if that's something you're interested in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere, I fixed it for you.",

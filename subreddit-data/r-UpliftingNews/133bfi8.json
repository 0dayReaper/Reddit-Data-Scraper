That shit was fucking awful. The car itself was great. Fun little thing. But the lack of physical buttons was an absolute nightmare to use. Tactile feel is incredibly important when driving. You wanna be able to adjust the AC or whatever without looking away from the road. Its dangerous to have only touch screens. Plus it's just stupid but thats purely an opinion. #physicalnobgang for life",

When it went out, so did the entire radio/sound system because it was all controlled through it. Engine runs like it's brand new still but if I want music I have to play Spotify on my phone, and it annoys me that the sound system is probably fine, but to use it I'd need my whole dashboard replaced all because one stupid screen died.\n\nThankfully everything else is controlled via knobs. If losing the touchscreen meant losing my AC/heat I would have rioted. I can't imagine the newest cars where the whole damn dash is one big touchscreen. If that thing goes out the car is fucked.",

I do not have much experience with other EVs, but I suspect that this is generally true of any BEV.  There are just fewer things that can go wrong.\n\nWe just had the tires changed: same place we always had them changed with our other cars.  No difference whatsoever.\n\nI don't know who told you that these things were tough, but they were mistaken.\n\nIf you tear out at every light with full acceleration, you are going to go through tires quicker.  Maybe that is what someone heard and though that this meant changing tires was harder?  I dunno.\n\nI personally like the simple design on the inside and I do not miss the button-mania that my last few Audis had.

Having a headphone jack allows me to use my phone, and charge it for the duration of all travel time. If I used my airpods, I would have to use one ear at a time, and switch them out when they died. And have one more thing to charge and an expensive item to risk losing if they fell out in transit or on the plane. Having the headphone jack is just an all around godsend when traveling.",

Having all of your controls on a single screen vs a bunch of physical buttons reduces complexity from a manufacturing standpoint. Every knob and button requires wires (and backlighting) for each location whereas having everything on one screen makes the wiring harness and design much simpler. Touchscreens are pretty cheap.\n\nEdit: I'm not agreeing with the move to touchscreen only controls, I hate it. But it's easy to see why manufacturers are moving in that direction since all they care about is cost.",

All of the models have a physical button either at the steering wheel (new S&amp;X) or at the stalk (3&amp;Y and older S&amp;X).\n\nThe logic is that you press the button once to do a single swipe and if more is needed, you can adjust the swiping mode with the buttons. 3&amp;Y just got a new update to make the process smoother.\n\nThe auto-mode still sucks, though. They should just admit defeat and get the $0.10 rain sensor all the other manufacturers use instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.",

            "comment": "That article seems a bit basic... Found one from the Independent that makes it seem like the judge was MUCH more scathing with his comments. Here's what he had to say:\n\n*\u201cThe elephant in the room should be noted at the outset. Gender identity is real. The record makes this clear. The medical defendants, speaking through their attorneys, have admitted it\u201d*\n\n*\"Any proponent of the challenged statute and rules should put up or shut up: do you acknowledge that there are individuals with actual gender identities opposite their natal sex, or do you not? Dog whistles ought not be tolerated\"*\n\nAnd in response to the claims made by the state of Florida in regards to regret over transition and that Florida's statements align with international consensus, he said:\n\n*\u201cThis assertion is false. No matter how many times the defendants say it, it will still be false. No country in Europe entirely bans these treatments.\u201d*\n\n[Here's the article for anyone who wants to read it.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/florida-transgender-law-desantis-lawsuit-b2352446.html)\n\nHe absolutely ripped apart the bullshit being used to forward these anti-trans bills. Let's hope this is the turning point and we see these laws completely dismantled.",

This is not the State\u2019s motivation\n\n&gt; The evidence purportedly showing these treatments are ineffective is far weaker not just of low or very low quality. Indeed, evidence suggesting these treatments are ineffective is nonexistent. \n\n&gt; If ever a pot called a kettle black, it is here. The statute and the rules were an exercise in politics, not good medicine. \n\n&gt; The defendants' contrary implication [that off label is rare and not acceptabe] is divorced from reality. \n\nSO many choices quotes. All of them tearing the defendants to shreds. The judge didn't, even a single time, say the defendants had an acceptable stance in ANY of their arguments.",

The Federal judges have extra powers to yell at trial lawyers and tell juries to ignore bullshit, so those \"bang the table\" argument fail.  The magistrate judge is lower than the presiding judge, but they bring such a wealth of experience that they can skip all the shenanigans and paperwork to deliver a judgement quickly (and quietly).",

I will do my best to answer. \n\nI used it here to mean \"I'm trans in a nonbinary way,\" \"I'm both things.\"\n\nTrans = gender identity doesn't match assigned gender (ie. the gender that was assigned to you at/before birth, usually based on your anatomy) \n\nNonbinary = gender identity is not male or female\n\nSince most babies are assigned male or female, most nonbinary people are trans by definition. The problem with that is that \"nonbinary\" encompasses a *huge* range of identities and ways to conceptualize and experience them. A lot of these ways are different enough from what most people think of when they hear \"trans\" that a lot of nonbinary people don't describe themselves as trans",

I feel the same way about things too, I just want people to love who they want, and not hate their fellow humans for arbitrary differences. Why is that so hard for people to understand?",

                    "comment": "Okay so there's like a billion reasons why these blanket bans are bad.  Number one, they're not based on science.  They're banning the current best treatment for a condition that affects a small portion of young people.  Imagine if they banned a certain leukaemia drug or something, it's the same kind of thing.  All the evidence we have says that transitioning is the best treatment for gender dysphoria and so denying people with gender dysphoria from accessing those treatments is inhumane at best. \n\nNumber two, it hurts more than trans kids.  This is the bit that even bigots should care about but they don't because the laws end up hurting people they hate.  HRT and puberty blockers aren't only used in trans healthcare.  They're actually used more often in cis kids with conditions like precocious puberty.  Bans like this also introduce barriers for those kids to access healthcare that they need. \n\nNumber three, the barriers to HRT aren't as low as conservatives like to pretend they are.  They're painting a picture of a world where you can go into your family doctor as a 10 year old, say you're a girl and they'll immediately put you on hormones and schedule you in for bottom surgery.  That simply doesn't happen.  At most they'd be put on blockers which are safe and reversible.  HRT comes after years of blockers and consultation with child psychologists and other medical professionals to ensure that the kid is actually trans and it's not just a phase.  The system already has these safeguards in place to protect the very very small minority of people who might regret it.  \n\nNumber four, the regret rate is astronomically small for medical transition.  Conservatives would have you believe that some insane number, up to 80, even 90% of people who transition end up regretting it.  Those numbers are simply not true.  It's actually one of the lowest regret rates out of nearly any other medical intervention.  People regret hip surgeries more.  People regret LASIK eye surgeries more.  The regret rate for gender affirming surgery is lower than the complication rate.  That means that there are people who went through this massive surgery, had it not go to plan and have to go back in for revisions to fix complications, and they still don't regret it.",

This article is about medical care for kids who are trans. \n2) Medical care for trans kids can be a wide range of things, with Puberty Blockers, Hormone Therapy, and surgery being some of the main things. Note that surgery is **not** common in the slightest and is extremely difficult to get, and typically it\u2019s only after 16 at the minimum that any children can get surgery. This also applies to Hormone Therapy, with the typical age being 16 when receiving care. It\u2019s also not easy to get, and there\u2019s usually a *lot* of hoops the child and their parents have to go through. \n\nIf this law went through children who are under the age of 18 wouldn\u2019t be able to access puberty blockers and would be forced to go through the wrong puberty which can no joke be traumatic to the child. Also, for trans kids under the age of 18 not having access to HRT (hormone therapy) can cause extreme mental distress to the point of suicide. Allowing them to access HRT drastically reduces the chances of suicide. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about regret rates of transitioning, there\u2019s many many studies showing it to be around 1-2% with the majority of the percentage being made up of people who had to detransition for safety or due to lack of support rather than them not being trans. \n\nWhat part of allowing children under the age of 18 medical care for being trans feels off or wrong to you? Why not allow them to get care under the age of 18?\n\nAlso, if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",

Puberty blockers, the earliest medical intervention for trans kids, aren\u2019t prescribed until the child is\u2026 wait for it\u2026 going into puberty.\n\nNot so many 10 year old girls or 12 year old boys think that they are velociraptors.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like they\u2019re provided HRT drugs on a whim. They have to go through therapy and jump through a bunch of medically supervised hoops to get to HRT. The only drug that is prescribed fairly quickly is puberty blockers alone to delay the onset of puberty and allow the youth to get enough therapy to determine if they are trans and if HRT is the correct option.\n\nDelayed puberty has basically no ill effects and in fact happens naturally sometimes. On the other hand a trans person having the wrong puberty has *significant* mental health and quality of life impacts. Roughly equal to forcing a cis person to go through the wrong puberty.\n\nCases of a youth jumping through all the therapy and medical hoops to get HRT who *isn\u2019t* trans are vanishingly rare, and cases where a cis person is *forced* into HRT against their will.\n\nCases of known trans kids who are forced to undergo the wrong puberty are depressingly common and what conservatives are trying to legislate *all* trans kids go through.

The idea is to block the onset of puberty to ensure the child is comfortable with their decision and to delay the discomfort of undergoing physical changes not inline with their gender identity. Then, once they are older they either go off them and let puberty resume or go off them and begin hormone replacement therapy.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that the use of puberty blockers is still relatively invasive and therefore the child must meet a set of criteria before being approved to use them. These include:\n\n* Show a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria  \n* Have gender dysphoria that began or worsened at the start of puberty  \n* Address any psychological, medical or social problems that could interfere with treatment  \n* Have entered the early stage of puberty  \n* Provide informed consent\n\nThis has nothing to do with kids deciding to do things because they're being \"dipshits.\"\n\nAlso, I just noticed your edit to your original post. That's pretty rare for Reddit. I may need some time to process this. :)",

During that time they\u2019ll have therapists, psychologists, and pediatricians that will help them decide the best route, and then once they turn 18 they can then decide to begin testosterone or estrogen hormone treatment.\n\nPuberty blockers for minors also works on three way informed consent: the individual, the parents, and their doctors. Most of the outrage for these laws are based on the notion that politicians should not be the arbiters of these medical decisions as they are not informed enough to know what is best for these patients.",

Puberty blockers do not cause permanent changes.\n\nFrom skimming the article you linked, there is so much that is blatantly factually wrong that, if not for the additional research I've done, I would have a _really_ hard time believing the author is who they say they are.  The most obviously damning is the following...\n\n&gt; Bicalutamide is a medication used to treat metastatic prostate cancer, and one of its side effects is that it feminizes the bodies of men who take it, \n\nThis is just flat out incorrect.  Bicalutamide does _not_ cause feminization - it is used as a testosterone blocker.  She either knows that and is lying to further her agenda, or she doesn't know that and shouldn't be in any position to gatekeep care.  Furthermore, [patients of the clinic have responded to her allegations](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/03/01/transgender-st-louis-whistleblower/) debunking Ms. Reed's bullshit and the associated university later [called her allegations \"unfounded\"](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/04/21/washington-university-says-allegations-against-transgender-center-are-unsubstantiated/) after an internal investigation.  She later responded implying that the University was lying and she had a bunch of data to back it up, but strangely, no such data has seemingly materialized based on what I've been able to find.  Interesting how that keeps happening in cases like this.\n\nMore simply, from checking the front page of that site, it's pretty clearly a conservative bullshit rag (one of the latest articles is about how the FBI helped Hillary Clinton rather than investigating her - fucking really lmao?!?!).  I really would not take anything reported there seriously.",

I had a hotel I used to service in a downtown area that had DC inverted daikin systems that constantly had issues due to spikes in power and brownouts.  Plus with how expensive they are, cost of parts, and constant issues, i'd hardly consider them a good alternative.  Even with a harmonic power filter installed I personally wouldn't put one in at my house.",

The argument could be made - or posed - that more people will heat their house than cool it, since the cold will surely kill you but the heat in upstate NY is overall less dangerous even if it does get pretty damn hot sometimes. Which could possibly translate to a higher pull on the grid.\n\nBut this is just for new construction. It will take at least 25 years for a sizeable portion of buildings to be new, and up to a century before we're seeing gas heating be rare in the area.",

In July 2019, New York enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The legislation also calls for 100% economy-wide net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Existing nuclear power plants in the state are considered zero emission resources. Facilities that are not technically capable of eliminating all carbon emissions can purchase carbon offsets to meet a portion of the required 100% net-zero goal. The offsets must be from nearby sources that reduce carbon, such as forests and agriculture.82,83 In 2020, New York's per capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were lower than those of any other state in the nation.84\n\nHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM\n\nI WONDER IF THERE IS A CONNECTION TO BE DRAWN HERE",

These systems are designed to use elements that CANNOT be used for weapons and are designed to have a very minimal risk of radiation leaks. A few have even received permits for demonstration sites. \n\nAs far as other fossil fuels, methane is the cleanest for power generation. If we assume the average furnace is 80% efficient and the average gas power plant is 60% efficient. You only need a heat pump that moves twice as much heat as energy consumed for it to be more efficient per unit of gas    (80% of the gas being used as heat vs 60% of the energy in gas being turned into electricity that powers a heat pump that moves the equivalent of 120% of a unit of gas\u2019 heat content). Add on the fact that a single, massive power plant has the ability for carbon capture and sequestration (questionable viability at the moment) and you can capture all of those emissions and store it back underground.",

Here's the problem: when the power goes out to a house, ELECTRIC HEAT STOPS WORKING.  Electric heat uses significant amounts of energy, so getting a battery backup or generator that can run it would be a significant investment.\n\nIf the power has gone out in a winter storm, it will take 2-12+ hours for the power to be restored.  I'm out of town but in a neighborhood with plenty of other houses, not on 50 acres in the middle of nowhere.  With 40+ mph wind gusts and temperatures below freezing, the temperature in my house rapidly drops without any heat.  Even with my gas heating stove running it was down to 50 in most of the house after 12 hours.\n\nDuring a winter storm, I can't just leave and go find somewhere warmer - the roads are completely unsafe, and my (electric) snowblower doesn't work when the power is out, so I probably can't even get out of my driveway.  So I need a reasonable option for heating my house with the electricity out, and so do millions of other people in the state.",

Put 4 AA batteries in the battery compartment on the gas heating stove, and it turns right on with the normal thermostat.  The stove fan doesn't run without power, but we'd actually replaced that with one of the cute ones that sit on top and just run off the heat difference to circulate air around the stove.  The room it's in was nice and warm, and with doors open the rest of the house stayed well above freezing.\n\nI absolutely think that \"the power will regularly go out in winter storms for 2-12+ hours, and we need good options to keep houses at safe temperatures when that happens\" is an intelligent argument.  Don't plan for that, and people die when they try to use their grill indoors, or have thousands of dollars in damages from burst pipes.\n\nGrid decentralization has not made any noticable difference for the power outages that I've seen.  The main transmission lines / substations aren't normally the problem in winter storms.  It's smaller groups of houses that lose power because a tree comes down on a line between the houses or to a single house.  If you have too many of those in bad weather it takes a long time for the repair crews to get to all of them.",

I live in an area that often gets rain and heavy winds strong enough to knock out the power across a wide area of the region. We have extended outages a few times every winter, and it's not because of the grid going down... it's downed power lines... everywhere, affecting thousands of customers to the extent that power crews can't get everything fixed for a few days, and up to a week or more. My house has no gas hookup. If I didn't have a fireplace, freezing to death could easily become a concern whenever a tree decides to take out a power line just down the street from me.\n\nIs that clear enough about the pointlessness of your comment on \"decentralization\"?\n\nNow, you should probably take a break before you have an aneurysm.",

Conduction burners take too long to change temperature. It's also a lot easier to judge the heat level with a flame. You can see immediate results in the pan. You also can't flambe\u00e9 with conduction. Gas broilers also work way better than electric. Taking gas out of a kitchen is almost like taking plumbing out of a bathroom.",

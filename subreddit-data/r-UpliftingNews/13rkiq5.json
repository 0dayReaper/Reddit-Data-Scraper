My close call was not as close because of the demand my landlord put one in. He kept refusing to replace my stove that was constantly acting oddly. The city made him because it kept setting off the carbon monoxide detector.",

Combined with being parents of a large family where you could possibly be under constant stress and trying to keep up a fast paced day to day schedule I could totally see this happening. Hell, I'm single and have had a period of my life where I was so stressed and mentally out of it that I just left my front door wide open until I noticed in the middle of the night after getting up.",

Her mother found her in the garage with the car running a little later than she thought she would. As a result, she destroyed a significant number of brain cells and was reduced to the capabilities of a nonverbal 1-2 year old. Very sad. I hope that the little girl's award included carbon monoxide detectors for her home.",

The Catholics still view themselves as the original church descended from the apostles. The Protestants still view (or at least remember) the Catholic Church as an oppressive force. The reformation itself kicked off for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons was (at the time) the Catholics were peddling indulgences (pay money and get less purgatory time). Many Protestants viewed this as heretical and taking advantage of others in the name of god. From the reformation to the violence in Ireland... it\u2019s a pretty complex and very long history. Filled with many doctrinal disagreements and violent encounters.",

In the 700s, iirc, the Catholics added the words \"et filos\" to the creed, so Catholics say \"[the holy spirit] proceeds from the father and the son\" vs \"from the father\" full stop. The Orthodox Church did not agree theologically with this addition, and that's part of the Catholic/Orthodox split. Or was also explained to me, as a teen, that Catholics can participate in Orthodox mass, as long as the Orthodox folk don't know you're Catholic, but an Orthodox person would not choose to participate in a Catholic mass.",

A lot of the country made the accusation that he could never be 'a true American' because they have this deluded idea that Catholics are basically foreigners who will do whatever the pope tells them to. \n\nFast forward to 2020. How many times have you seen someone even mention that Joe Biden is Catholic? Probably not ever and as insane as the Republicans are right now I'd be shocked if they evoked that line of attack in the coming months.",

Islam is based on Christianity which is based on Judaism, so it is no surprise that there are so many similarities.",

I mean, that's like saying that americans are british but not people living on the british isles?\n\nedit: and like to be clear, I am saying this as an agnostic person in a generally protestant country. But like the Catholic church has roots from the 1st century c.e., and the orthodox church split off in the 11th century, and the protestant is a very specific rebellious movement from the 16th century. Just how do you in any way consider that more christian than the 2000 year old entity? If you want to make the argument that the protestant church is more faithful to the ideas and philosophy of christ then sure I'm not christian but that's the impression I have, but to say it's christian where the other is not? how?!",

To terrorize people (civil population) is only one aspect of terrorism, but that doesn't make it terrorism.\nBy definition, they used to be a terrorist organization back in the mid 1800s when they fought for abolition by scaring and threatening various politicians via violent / non-peaceful means. It wasn't until Nathan Forrest took control changing their mission statement and made them more of a civil gang rather than a terrorist organization.",

Now that it isn't, they've not been particularly publicly violent, so \"hate group\" is the description. Also, there are a lot more splinter groups, of varying amounts of ideology and action, claiming heritage to the Klan.\n\nReally, you could chalk the labels up to 1) bad timing, 2) the inability of officials to, in a \"hard evidence\" sense, attribute the violence of a few to the group on a whole, and 3) different factions. The larger the splinter group, the more likely it has been extra careful in their PR in recent years to (relatively) clean up their image and disavow the violent among them.\n\nA terrible ideology no less, just harder to pin down and label nowadays.",

Keep this stuff in the courts, not DJT's head.\n\nEdit: I feel I should clarify something. Trump *said* that Antifa is a terrorist group. This has no legal basis. When a president makes a declaration like this they're actually declaring that the group has been classified according to some statutory authority. For example, the foreign terrorist groups I mentioned earlier were classified according to provisions of one of the AUMFs or Patriot act (or a handful of other acts), an authority created by Congress and signed into law. There are qualifying requirements even for these laws.\n\nThere is no such corresponding domestic statute that giving a president the ability to classify a domestic group as terrorist. Trump can say what he wants, but legally speaking it holds the same weight as Peter Griffin's declaration of sovereignty over Petoria.",

Unfortunately, many of those limitations have been eroded, especially for organizations labeled terrorist groups since 9/11. During the period after 9/11, people tolerated this, because they thought the terrorists were only al-Qaeda. \n\nIf we start designated every local political group a terrorist, then we will quickly descend the road to completely totalitarian government control.

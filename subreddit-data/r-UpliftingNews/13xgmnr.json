See, if an energy producer is paid directly on delivery, they have no reason to care about storage, only about capacity. And the demand grows faster than supply, so there is no worry that any power will be wasted. So who will pay for the large amount of storage necessary to operate renewables smoothly?",

                    "comment": "&gt;Looks like India is excelling in common sense!\n\nIn this case, yes, though it's more of a \"broken clock is right twice a day\" situation...\n\nFor example, this is _finally_ starting to happen because it now happens to be the cheapest possible option, but when it was only _slightly_ more expensive, they kept on building countless dirty coal plants, even though many of their citizens were dying decades before they should have been due to how polluted their cities are - not to mention that they are heavily contributing to global warming despite the fact that India will be one of the most devastated countries in the world when sea levels rise, with potentially hundreds of millions of people at risk of losing their homes and possessions and becoming refugees, and they'll be extremely lucky if that's all they lose.\n\nMany of their issues stem from the fact that they elected Modi (the Indian Trump) as their Prime Minister, who is a far-right populist, ultra-(Hindu)-nationalist (similar to a white nationalist in the US, except instead of hating people based for being the wrong skin color, they hate people for being the wrong religion - and we're talking KKK-grade hate, not the modern cosplay-GQP-grade hate - as there have been numerous mob lynchings of religious minorities since Modi came to power), and he and his ruling party have very close ties to the similar far-right, ultra-nationalist Russian leadership, leading India to be one of the few countries on Earth to have not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and they have continued to prop up Putin's regime by being a key trade partner for Russia in oil/gas/arms/etc.\n\nAnd, like Russia, the increasingly autocratic state in India also has tight control over most media, and Russia has used this to their advantage in spreading their Ukrainian Invasion propaganda, by having their hand-picked stories not just reported on by Russian-state-media, but also by Indian-state-media, making the propaganda seem more \"legitimate\" to the uninformed since it is coming from a \"3rd party\".\n\nIf you haven't seen it, Hasan Minaj, a 1st generation Indian-American, did a great episode on most of this stuff (at least largely covering what's going on within India under Modi - it was well before the current Russian invasion of Ukraine) on his Netflix show, Patriot Act (which can be watched for free on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqZ_SH9N3Xo)).\n\nAnd, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaSU1VT-vM), you can once again use Youtube for free to see the followup segment he did during an episode the following season about how many death threats Hasan had received over the past year in response to the airing of his episode critizing the anti-democratic, pro-fascist ways of Modi and his party.\n\nHe also told sad stories about how many of his now-indoctrinated, extended family members still living in India told him that he was a traitor to India/Hinduism and was no longer a part of their family (and familial bonds in India might as well be held together with the twisted steel cabling that they use to hold up giant suspension bridges - they're nearly impossible to break) because he dared to speak out about some of the things he thought Modi could be doing better for India and her people, but Modi's cult does NOT like anything he does being questioned...\n\nEDIT: Lmfao, this comment was at around +50 before the Hindu nationalists found it and started brigading it with downvotes into the negatives (yet, interestingly, it's _just_ dozens upon dozens of downvotes, but not a _single_ comment attempting to actually _justify_ Modi's far-right, Hindu-nationalist policies).\n\nThanks for helping to prove my point about what happens in \"tHe WoRLd'S BigGeST dEmoCrACy\" (which, under Modi, has been experiencing some of the most rapid democratic backsliding ever recorded - toward becoming an autocratic-theocracy - according to the widely-shared consensus among the dozens of independant, international democratic freedom watchdog agencies, and those religious autocracies _definitely_ tend to turn out _much_ better than silly \"democracies\" with their silly \"freedoms\" like the \"freedom of religion\", anyway) when _ever_ _anyone_ even _mentions_ that _someone_ has _ever_ said _anything_ that even _suggests_ that there _may_ be _something_ your **fascist, theocratic cult leader** isn't doing absolutely _perfectly_...\n\nSo, keep the downvotes coming, and I'm sure _they_ will _definitely_ show the world that Modi's followers are _totally_ unwavering (and _certainly_ not super _insecure_) in their belief that he is _perfect_, and are _completely_ unphased by any _criticism_ of him. After all, why would _anyone_ so _confident_ in the _greatness_ of their leader feel the need to silence _all_ criticism of him?\n\nIf he's so _great_, then I'm sure his squeaky clean record (which, to be fair, only includes a _handful_ of _major_ acts of _genocide_) would speak for itself and wouldn't need an army of lemmings working overtime to ensure that such comments are _always_ ultimately downvoted to hell and hidden anywhere they are made on the internet. Yet, weirdly, they _always_ seem to end up that way...\n\nBut, perhaps, despite Modi being undoubtedly _perfect_ and able to hold up to even the most severe scrutiny with ease, you think downvoting _any_ criticism of him will help ensure that he will be able to help you and your fellow Hindu-nationalists achieve your _wildest_ dreams that he's promised you as soon as possible - meaning, of course, that you will no longer have to share even 1m^2 of your _enormous_ country with any of those _disgusting_ non-Hindus (Buddhists, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Jains, Jews, Zoroastrians, Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, etc.) that currently make up over 20% of your population, which equals more human beings total than the _entire population_ of the United States.\n\nIt _definitely_ doesn't make Modi's followers look absolutely _terrified_ of the use of free speech to critique your Glorious Leader\u2122 and/or his ~~genocidal ethnic/religious cleansing plans~~ _totally_ normal and _entirely_ benign plans to Make India Great Again\u2122, which was (_completely_ coincidentally, I'm _sure_) also almost _always_ a hallmark of such famously _wonderful_ governments that were so _great_ for both their country and the world, such as Hitler's Third Reich, Stalin's USSR, Mao's PRC, Kim's DPRK, and, now, Modi's H-In(du)dia.",

Except for the handful where you get caught red-handed and feel the need to \"clarify\" that you have _definitely_ never voted for Modi... It's quite interesting how many times you seem to feel the need to clarify that...\n\nEither you are lying or are just not old enough to vote for your idol yet (or is there somehow an even further-right party in India I'm not aware of?). From your posts, it wouldn't be that surprising if you were just Modi's own personal alt account, lol. But, seeing as he's probably more busy crushing the rights of religious minorities in your country with legislation, threats, and violence, exactly like you call for... more likely, you're just one of his vast army of millions upon millions of brainwashed youth. Ever heard of Hitler's Youth? ;) Or has that been wiped from your history books by Modi and his ruling party already?\n\nMake sure to bring the rest of Modi's Youth to downvote this comment to hell too, like they have with literally every other comment on the internet that doesn't utterly suck him and his genocidal, fascist positions off, to help drive my point even further past home than you already have!\n\nSincerely, _thank you so much_ for your help in explicitly showing the validity of my comment, Vishu! Now people don't have to take my word for it when you've presented your account as a primary source of _exactly_ what I'm talking about, literally almost word-for-word... It's truly uncanny how on-the-nose your comment history is in providing real-world evidence of my _exact_ points.",

However, if you think the world operations on just finding a working solution, you have a lot to learn. Most engineers would be out of a job, considering one of the main goals of engineering is finding the cheapest working solution.\n\nFor example, people point to how Roman infrastructure is still standing while our infrastructure rapidly falls apart. We\u2019re ignoring a lot of the other complexities here, but would you rather, say, pay 1 million dollars for a 100 year bridge, or 1 billion dollars for a 1,000 year bridge? Or maybe a more relatable example: Would you rather pay $20,000 for a car that lasts 10 years, or $200,000 for a car that lasts 25 years (assuming all else is equal)?\n\nIt is often worth using slightly worse technology in exchange for significant price savings. This applies to just about everything we interact with including, guess what, our energy generation. Nuclear is incredibly expensive.\n\nNow right now, nuclear is the most reliable non fossil fuel, so some might say it\u2019s worth it despite the cost, but you are talking about the future, and perhaps you noticed I said \u201cright now\u201d. Along the same lines of figuring out the cheapest solution, if there is no cheaper solution, it is often worth investing money to find one. For example, we had working solar panels in the 60\u2019s. Does that mean we should use them? Hell no!! They were ridiculously expensive per energy produced, but what engineers were able to do was make improvements, dropping the price per watt by about 99.9%, to way below that of nuclear. \n\nNow energy storage is still a hinderance to going 100% solar/wind, but we have far from maximized our capacity for solar/wind at our current amount of energy storage. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it, just look at the energy companies wallets. They have already bought up the next ~5 years worth of solar panel production, (at the same time they are shutting down their unprofitable nuclear plants btw). And the cost of renewable generation and energy storage continue to plummet.\n\nIn summary, the data unequivocally shows that renewables+energy storage are the future, unless nuclear can miraculously make a breakthrough that costs their cost by like 80%. Now fusion is right around the corner, but it has been for over 50 years sooo.\n\nAs for France, they built their reactors many decades ago when renewables were still crazy expensive, so reactors clearly were the best clean option. As their reactors start to age out soon, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what they pick.",

They are not scientists, and are presumably using limited funds to conduct this work relative to a molecular biology lab.  Feels like something your old uncle Roy might say based on the news sources he watches.\n\nI also would have bet against this hypothesis being correct.  Humans have risked destroying themselves several times due to their greed, anger, and ego (cold war comes to mind, but also looking at a 25% decline in total population by 2100 thanks to climate change).\n\nIf I were some special advisor to the president, I'd want to see this work repeated, at scale, and if it proves correct a second time, I would change many of my previous recommendations about how to pull us out of the tailspin our species is currently in.",

This article points out that they're much more likely to do these little favors for people in their in group. So your view of the world as a whole can remain unchanged - individuals are kind on small groups, but large groups are terrible to each other.\n\nThis is a very common and often-repeated study, that's good for publicity and for securing funding. And yes, these are scientists at a major research lab, which was clearly stated in the first line of the article.\n\nA lot of people who spend too much time on the Internet or watching cable news think that the world is this dark and dreary place where survival is rare and happiness is fleeting. But the reality is that most people are generally kind (if a bit self-absorbed) and prefer to treat each other with kindness. Most people prefer not to steal from, hurt, or even lie to each other. People who do are seen as an aberration, which makes them stand out. If everyone was terrible, then stories about terrible people wouldn't get any traction, because it would be most people's lived experience.\n\nBut I guess you proved me wrong about one thing - these studies clearly are needed. Because there's people out there who haven't seen the multitude of other studies like it. Thank you for showing me that I was wrong.",

The study analyzed over 1,000 request events in domestic and informal settings on five continents, featuring more than 350 individuals representing eight diverse languages and cultures.\n\nIt found that someone will signal a need for assistance once every two minutes and 17 seconds on average and that small requests for assistance are complied with seven times more often than they are declined in all cultures. The study also found that people decline requests very rarely and typically explain why when they do so. The researchers note that while cultural differences in resource-sharing exist, the tendency to help others transcends cultural differences, especially among close social circles.",

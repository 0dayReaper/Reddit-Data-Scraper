Obviously there's then an issue of what to do with the bucket - trash it all instead of recycle? Dump it into a dumpster and then reuse? If you live in a house and have a garbage service, you could just dump it into a couple paper bags and then set those into the can before pickup (without having to worry about carrying them and having the bag tear/leak). It's not a perfect solution, but it does offer an alternative to scooping into a plastic bag every day! ",

I like to advocate for taking small steps towards sustainability and reducing waste, nobody can start to do everything at once and nobody can be perfect. But just doing a couple little things like reusing glass jars from food products or bringing your own bags to the store are small steps in the right direction that you can continue to build on.\n\nWhenever I suggest this in a completely encouraging and totally non-judgemental way, to people I know in person and people online, *the vast majority of the time* I get some version of, \"Well I just don't see the point\" or \"but that just sounds like a hassle, it's too inconvenient.\" To something as simple as trying not to buy individually packed snacks and parsing them out yourself instead or something like that. People are just that lazy.\n\nPeople just genuinely don't care and they're not willing to do something that benefits the environment because they see no direct benefit to themselves. Even if you try to frame it in a way that it's still beneficial to them, it's still not worth giving up the convenience to them.\n\nIt's a mindset and perspective that has to change. They won't respond to any suggestions or try to improve because they value that convenience above all else, and that has to change before anything else can. Nobody should value those tiny little conveniences over things that actually matter... But most people seem to.",

They are simply thrown away. Will a plastic bag ban/tax be inconvenient for some people? Yes, but it is a necessary inconvenience. I mean every place in the mall food courts give plastic bags by default even though people are generally only going to be walking their food 20 feet to the nearest table. I actually have to get aggressive with the cashier to not get a plastic bag since basically 0% of people decline one since its \"free\".

I try to bring them to the recycling bin for trash bags but it doesn't always happen. Especially when the SO just doesn't care like I do.\n\nI don't like the thick plastic ones; seems like those are just being pushed for profit. Still, it is perfectly fine and easy to use fabric (or paper in a pinch). I'm not understanding the reluctance to at least make an effort. It is hard for me to do laundry due to back problems but washing fabric bags is literally the easiest, lightest thing I wash. They dry super fast too (except for the Sprouts bag, fuck you Sprouts).",

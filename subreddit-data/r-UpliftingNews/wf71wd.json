They all lobby for the same thing; keep pricing power in their hands, and have no restrictions. This feeds the whole system.\n\nDrug and supply companies charge through the roof, and hospitals and pharmacies pass that on to the consumer. Then the insurance companies step in and say, \"buy our product because we will negotiate these insane prices down, and then help cover the cost\". So pharma and supplies get to charge way more than they need to, and insurance can pretend to be helping you instead of draining your wallet.\n\nIf companies come along and start undercutting prices, the insurance companies have less to market about how they can help you. If I can buy drugs for cheaper, not going through insurance, than I get them with insurance, what are they even doing for me? Some insurance plans are tailored specifically toward people who need lots of prescriptions.",

In France at least, most insurances or banks will cover 85% to 100% of medical fees, even abroad, up to millions. You could get in a ski accident in Japan, have to pay tens of thousands in helicopter travel fees and you'd pay nothing or close to nothing cause it's handled by the insurance.\nMost plans offer 1 pair of glasses per year for 1euro or a bit more, and medecine can't be sold for a lot either",

Personally I tried stimulants when I was in high school and hated the feeling of coming off at the end of the day. My favorite thing about atomoxetine is how smooth it is. Sure it doesn\u2019t have the same kick stimulants do, but feeling pretty ok 24/7 is better to me than feeling great for a few hours then feeling like shit for a few hours every day. My executive disfunction is def still around but it\u2019s really helped my anxiety and it does quiet my brain down a bit making it easier to think. Currently I\u2019m on 80mg. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m going to try to see about combining atomoxetine with stimulants soon, just to use on days I really need to put my head down and work. No idea how it\u2019s gonna go \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

For the most part, the process is dehumanizing, petty, and cruel.\n\nFuck our bullshit healthcare system.",

I've spoken to numerous people, who have long careers in Healthcare administration and Public Health, and have never even heard of them.\n\n**PBMs posted higher revenues in recent years than the largest drug manufacturers.** And most people don't even know they exist, which is just how the PBMs like it. \n\nThey are leeches that drain money from the Healthcare system and provide zero benefit to anybody aside from themselves.\n\nTo put it simply: PBMs are negotiators. In exchange for their connections and ability to give a manufacturer's drug higher sales, they receive sizable percentages from the sales. \n\n(to explain this - your prescription insurance has a \"formulary.\" This is the list of drugs your insurance company will cover. It's usually comprised of \"tiers,\" with drugs on Tier 1 being preferred and therefore cheaper for the consumer. If a drug can be on Tier 1 for a few major insurance companies, this can be a massive boost to sales. PBMs negotiate which drugs are on what Tier.)\n\nThis is one reason why drug manufacturers have to price their drugs so high. \n\nCompany A sells drug X for $3 a tablet. Company B sells the same drug for $50 a tablet. The PBMs are more willing to work with Company B, because the PBM is getting a flat percentage of the sales. So, a higher base price results in a larger kickback to them.\n\nThey also process the vast majority of prescription drug insurance claims, and charge administrative fees for doing so.",

Because they are buying the products for the entire country. They can dictate the price to the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nUnlike the US congress that made it ILLEGAL for Medicare to negotiate the price that the taxpayers pay for the drugs that they make available.",

She added that prices for cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and nervous system drugs were among the cheapest in other developed countries, averaging about 80 percent lower than in the U.S.\n\nPrice-capping and government health agencies negotiating prices are common almost everywhere except the United States. \n\n[Source](https://www.drugwatch.com/featured/us-drug-prices-higher-vs-world/)",

Mark Cuban does what consumers wants, even though he's not physically representative of the consumers since he's just one person. \n\nCapitalists usually do what capitalists want, which is generating profits for themselves. Sometimes, generating profits require the fulfillment of consumer demands. But other time, generating profits is done through the formation of monopolies, collusion to price fix, corruption of elected officials and regulating agencies to gain unfair market advantages, corruption of the consumers through intensive marketing campaigns, theft, extortion, etc. \n\nEconomic governance should be democratic just like the other types of governance are democratic.",

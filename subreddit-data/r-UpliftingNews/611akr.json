Luckily I haven't worked retail in over a decade and my raises are a percentage of my current salary so I'm not in that position anymore.

My boss offered me a $0.25 raise, so I went and got another job the next day that paid 50% commission instead of an hourly wage, just based on my word of what I billed out in a day. Second best part of the story: I gave 2 weeks notice and boss sent me home and had to pay me the two weeks. Meanwhile, I started the next day at the new job. Absolute best part of this is when I knew I had made the right move: Within a month there, I was offered a more senior position based on my work and my pay skyrocketed. I miss the 90s",

New people start at 5%, more senior get 10%, people who are 'individual contributors' get 15% or more. If the company does poorly we get nothing, if we do well we get a big pile of cash.

Furniture salesman and the better we sell the better food we get. \nOn shittier months he'll grab us some lil ceasers hot N ready. On better months we'll all get full course entrees from this amazing local italian restaurant(best alfredo ive ever had). \nAny days where the majority of the staff have to work 10 or more hour (black friday,boxing day, VIP days) he'll make sure we get breakfast,coffee and lunch or dinner. \nHonestly even though I could make more of similar closer to home (30 minute commute out of town) I wouldn't give this job up for much.

EDIT: Just to clarify, It only only applies to German employees under contract with the Porsche AG. \n\n* [These](http://i.imgur.com/G4v0zj1.png) are the figures from 2016 compared to 2015, from Porsche's [official press website](https://presse.porsche.de/prod/presse_pag/PressResources.nsf/Content?ReadForm&amp;languageversionid=710664).\n\n* [Porsche's official press release in English](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/company/porsche-employees-bonus-record-result-13537.html).\n\nEDIT: Since I posted this to /r/cars comment section as well, this might also be interesting to you:\n\nBonus payments from other car firms in Germany (with source):\n\n* [Mercedes](http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/autoindustrie/daimler-mitarbeiter-bekommen-5400-euro-praemie-a-1132817.html): 5400\u20ac to 130,000 employees for 2016\n\n* [BMW](http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.mitarbeiter-bonus-bmw-zahlt-eine-praemie-von-8095-50-euro.83aff09f-354f-44f8-bddf-14d9bf1a61bc.html): 8995.50\u20ac for 2016\n\n* [Audi](https://industriemagazin.at/a/audi-mitarbeiter-bekommen-weniger-bonus-fuer): 6900\u20ac for 2015\n\n* [VW](http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/braunschweig_harz_goettingen/VW-Betriebsrat-Mitarbeiter-Praemie-kommt-im-Mai,vw2996.html): 3950\u20ac to 120,000 employees for 2015\n\nKeep in mind that most of these employees of the above manufacturers receive this bonus payment only when they are subject to a certain labour agreement. Not every single one of their employees receives the payment, unlike at Porsche this year.\n\nEDIT: Reformatting and more stats:\n\n* [These are the latest numbers](http://i.imgur.com/78wMUFM.png) I could find of the **average** profit on each car sold , by the [CAR institute \\(Center Automotive Research\\) of Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen.](https://www.uni-due.de/car/). \n\nLeft to right: Manufacturer - Profit Margin (in%) - Profit of each car sold\n\nAlso highly interesting IMO. Would you look at Ferrari? \u00d6\n\n",

Profit per employee comes in at $195k, so they're giving roughly 5% of profits back as bonus. \n\nCompare to Walmart, who made a $14.69bn profit last year[^[2]](http://amigobulls.com/stocks/WMT/income-statement/annual), and employ 2.3 million people[^[3]](http://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/company-facts). That gives a profit per employee of about $6390, so if they followed the same bonus scheme as Porsche then each employee would get $320 - smaller, but still a nice perk to end the year. ",

It helps balance some of the market forces that may favor the very rich.\n\nMy wife works for a US company, and the bonus they gave to employees for the past few years has been in the $10k-$15 range. So even her admin assistant got that, which is like adding 30-50% to her salary. Then, and I suspect the German companies do this too, their executive bonuses are massive.\n\nThey also have this interesting cumulative bonus system for executives where you get part of your executive bonus each year, but the rest of it vests for 2 and 3 years, and that happens every year so once you've been there 3 years then your executive bonus really starts to snowball and it becomes fiscally irresponsible to quit because your bonus becomes higher than even your salary would be if you worked somewhere else. That's the only bonus system I've ever seen that really does retain people.",

You are assuming Porsche would have hired the same number of engineers with those higher bonuses and pensions etc. as without, which is simply not true. Most of them probably would have been hired anyways, but some would not, and hence would have been without a job. So you could equally make the statement that this structure has enabled some people to get a job they otherwise woud not have, at the expense of other employees that would have earned more. Also, the unions sit on the board so they are complicit in this, but they go along with it because they know how it works, just don't like to admit it publicly.",

Considering they sold [237,778 vehicles in 2016](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/company/porsche-deliveries-2016-sales-record-13310.html), that makes a rough profit of \u20ac3,805,399,112.

A major news network did a segment of ingenious ways people collected the oil using found materials from straw to human hair.\n\nI remember finding that there was actually a company that DID follow through and make bouys that encircled a spill with these neta filled with human hair. Right at the end they said that they bouys would sink because they couldn't float due to working too well. The bouys would sink under the spill which would release finer particles of the oil instead of being collected at the surface level.\n\nI'm interested to see how these folks deal with that issue....",

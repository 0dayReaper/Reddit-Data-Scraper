            "comment": "By David Gelles  \nA half century after founding the outdoor apparel maker Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, the eccentric rock climber who became a reluctant billionaire with his unconventional spin on capitalism, has given the company away.  \nRather than selling the company or taking it public, Mr. Chouinard, his wife and two adult children have transferred their ownership of Patagonia, valued at about $3 billion, to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization. They were created to preserve the company\u2019s independence and ensure that all of its profits \u2014 some $100 million a year \u2014 are used to combat climate change and protect undeveloped land around the globe.  \nThe unusual move comes at a moment of growing scrutiny for billionaires and corporations, whose rhetoric about making the world a better place is often overshadowed by their contributions to the very problems they claim to want to solve.  \nAt the same time, Mr. Chouinard\u2019s relinquishment of the family fortune is in keeping with his longstanding disregard for business norms, and his lifelong love for the environment.  \n\u201cHopefully this will influence a new form of capitalism that doesn\u2019t end up with a few rich people and a bunch of poor people,\u201d Mr. Chouinard, 83, said in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe are going to give away the maximum amount of money to people who are actively working on saving this planet.\u201dPatagonia will continue to operate as a private, for-profit corporation based in Ventura, Calif., selling more than $1 billion worth of jackets, hats and ski pants each year. But the Chouinards, who controlled Patagonia until last month, no longer own the company.  \nIn August, the family irrevocably transferred all the company\u2019s voting stock, equivalent to 2 percent of the overall shares, into a newly established entity known as the Patagonia Purpose Trust.  \nThe trust, which will be overseen by members of the family and their closest advisers, is intended to ensure that Patagonia makes good on its commitment to run a socially responsible business and give away its profits. Because the Chouinards donated their shares to a trust, the family will pay about $17.5 million in taxes on the gift.",

Yvon Chouinard mentioned in his book \u2018Let My People Go Surfing\u2019 that he never intended for his clothing to be cheap. He wanted it to be a lifetime investment. If you buy a Patagonia jacket he wanted you to be able to keep that jacket for the rest of your life and never have to replace it. He did this by creating the \u2018Worn Wear\u2019 program where they repair all Patagonia gear that gets damaged for free. He also used the most sustainable, durable fabric that could be bought, and if it couldn\u2019t be bought they\u2019d invent it. Such a cool philosophy and with how destructive the fashion industry is to our environment, I wish these ideas could be adopted across the entire industry.",

The trust doesn't seem to be a charitable organization of any sort, so thats probably why they paid taxes. However, since the trust is controlled by them, and the trust got the voting shares, they keep control of the company, which is probably worth the 17m price tag.",

When I envision peoples\u2019 responses to my death, I do think people will care but I don\u2019t think it would be very profound. I\u2019m not sure haha. I have a couple of close friends in life but that\u2019s still my perception. I guess it\u2019s because I go through some mental health problems and people don\u2019t seem to check in with me hence I assume they don\u2019t care too much. I do see the irrationality in my thought patterns though. What is your response to that? Sorry for the rant haha.",

The hole that people leave never really goes away.\n\nI hope that more people tell you what you mean to them, because it's an easy thing to forget and an easy thing to regret.\n\nSorry if this sounds weird, I'm up too late feeling like shit myself.

A city of lost souls and a shite footy team. One middle-aged man shuffled along the street, head down, either unaware or desensitized to the downpour. Seconds felt like hours. One girl began to cry.\n\nAll of a sudden our tutor cried out \"LOOK!\"\n\nWe snapped our heads up from our forlorn thoughts and gazed through the now tarnished windows. Gateshead, and beyond, Newcastle. Cheers roared along the bus. Tinnies, previously hidden were thrown about the aisle. Our loyal bus driver wept a single tear and quietly whispered \"We'll soon be in the Toon, lads.\"",

The phone numbers and the corresponding service descriptions are managed by the European Commission and harmonised across all EU member states. Harmonised services of social value use the prefix 116, which is then followed by three digits indicating the type of service.\n\nAfter the commission has assigned a number, it is then up to the telephone regulator in each country (such as Ofcom in the United Kingdom) to allocate the number to a telephone service provider and providing organisation of their choice.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

It brings up the example of the UK's switch from coal to natural gas for heating, and it's effect on reducing the suicide rate. By removing this quick and accessible method, people became less likely to go through with it.\n\nI think by talking to your friend you bought him time to let those thoughts pass. I'm reminded of [Craig Ferguson's monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLzpt3caHw) where he talks about just plain forgetting to jump off a bridge because the bartender insisted on drinking with him that night.",

(As opposed to traumas that sometimes cause short term suicidal thoughts.) I would be careful about saying that they realized it was a bad idea. Maybe by talking it out they felt like someone actually respected their perspective that it *was* a good idea given how they feel and that compassion gave them the strength to revisit other options. When you feel like someone is going to grasp the seriousness of your successes and failures within the context of you just wanting to end it all it can make \"failing again\" seem less scary because you're not doing it alone. That person who you showed how seriously you were hurting will have weight to their words when they say \"Hey it's cool that ____ didn't work out. I'm proud of you for trying.\" \n\nPoint is, don't reason with or project with suicidal people. It can backfire in a big way. If you want to help just be the person who hears their thoughts. And if you can't be that person that's okay too.",

Not only is suicide massively stigmatized, but indeed the state has the right take you, against your will, to a psychiatric facility and force anti-depressants on you until you change your mind. \n\nAs it stands, we make those who want to commit suicide do it in terrifying and grotesque ways. It's selfish. It's narcissistic. It's immoral. ",

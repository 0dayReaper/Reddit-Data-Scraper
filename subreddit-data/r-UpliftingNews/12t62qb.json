The naysayers always say something like \"Look how much petroleum and plastic goes into manufacturing that solar panel...real green amirite?!\"  \n\n\nWhat they fail to account for, is...yes, manufacturing the thing, requires an up front carbon investment....then while you're using that thing, there's no additional carbon investment.   \n\n\nElectric vehicles always seem to draw these crowds. \"Woah it takes 500 gallons of fuel to make one electric vehicle....not very green!\" What they don't understand though, is that you drive that vehicle for up to a decade or more without needing to constantly refuel it.  Let's say you drive a gas vehicle that gets 25mpg approx 10k miles per year. That's 400 gallons of gas per year. Not to mention frequent oil changes, and the additional maintenance that goes into the gas vehicle.   \n\n\nSame with solar. You manufacture the panels with an up front carbon investment, and then they continue to produce far beyond the payoff of that investment. As technology improves, that upfront investment becomes smaller, the manufacturing process becomes more efficient and the products gain an increased lifespan for production.   \n\n\nThe idea of going green isn't about immediately ceasing all carbon emissions and other pollutants. That would be great, but we aren't there yet. It's about reducing the continual output of these emissions and pollutants over the given lifespan. Comparing the total emissions during the entire lifecycle from manufacturing to disposal, things like solar panels will contribute a large magnitude less to the carbon cycle vs most other mainstream power generation methods. There are certainly other green energy sources which are either not widely used yet, or have their own set of controversy (nuclear for example)",

Aside from future battery tech likely not requiring lithium at all, over the lifetime of these products they're much better for the environment, and especially CO2 emissions.\n\nLithium mining is bloody awful though, especially in countries where the necessary planning and protections don't exist to prevent pollution entering the water table. I'm hoping some of the money the fed is throwing at the problem goes toward getting some of the various upcoming battery techs out to market. There's a number of fairly well-proven techs now that have superior energy density to lithium-ion batteries while not requiring exotic materials.",

So, in a sense, no it's not a ton by comparison. At the same time, this budget has been going up over time. There is a lot of work to be done in how we spend our money as a country, but given the current state of our government and our political climate, it's pretty good. It's a firm stepping stone toward more sustainable energy, anyway.\n\nAs for \"is it good to be investing in\", there are very few angles to say \"no\". Renewable energy sources like solar do still have an initial carbon footprint, but they makeup for themselves throughout their life time. Having more people with solar power being supplied directly to their homes can help take some strain off the power grid and utilizing solar energy for larger populations can help ease the use of fossil fuels. You also eliminate the need to transport fossil fuels for energy which saves additional fossil fuels.  Additionally, even without the climate argument, we have a fixed amount of fossil fuels and natural gases to work with. Sunlight, however, will last significantly longer and it's better to make the switch slowly while most people can still afford energy.\n\nWe're making really slow progress, especially in comparison to countries at a similar point of development. We're also making slow progress on a lot of things in comparison to countries at a similar point of development. While small victories shouldn't be seen as \"good enough\", they should still be celebrated along the way.",

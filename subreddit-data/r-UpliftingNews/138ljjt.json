More like dogs have some genetic variants, that make some lineages much much more susceptible to drugs metabolised/transported that way.\n\n\nAnd especially with dogs with no papers there\u2018s just no way to tell how they are gonna react to drugs with this proboem.\n\n\n\n\nSo nah, for most dogs the drugs are actually fine with minor side effects. Some just overdose at very low dosages anyway.\n\n\n\nWorms are still different enough to us, that the side effects aren\u2018t too severe. Chemo has to be \u201aworse\u2018 because the cancer cells are us after all. So they are pretty much just a susceptible as we are. (Hence a shit ton of research being required to find cancer treatments that aren\u2018t chemo, which have much less side effects; because they target specific things that the cancer has or does differently.\n\n\n\nAnyway, nah the drugs aren\u2019t that bad in itself, if your dog can metabolise them.",

The local animal control or neighbors would always catch him and bring him back to the lady.\n\nOne time they brought him back, and the old lady had died. So the family of hers dropped him off/let him loose in the woods. He was out on his own for a few months until he was picked up by our humane society. But he was like this dog, just not well equipped to be out on his own and just wanted love. He's still super calm unless he sees a dog bigger than him, then he starts barking. We think he just had some sort of run in with a bigger dog when out on his own.",

It's a pretty gnarly treatment regimen, they can't be active for quite awhile afterward because the dead heartworms can clump up and block vessels. So treatment to kill them has to be slow. All of this can be prevented by giving dogs heartworm medicine at least once every quarter. I have my own bottle of sterile 1% liquid Ivermectin that I give my dogs to save money. Sometimes vets will let you buy the biggest heartworm preventive tab/chew and you can cut it up by weight to get 2-4 doses out of one package.",

There's no actual way to prevent heartworms, the Ivermectin kills the baby worms before they can grow into adults and cause problems. I hope that eases your fear since as long as you're giving the prevention at least quarterly, your doggie will not be affected. I rescued an elderly dog with severe heartworms and other health problems. Treatment was intense but he made it through. You're a good owner and take care of your pup.",

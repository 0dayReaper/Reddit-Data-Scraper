Mattel claim they are making dolls 'just like them', only with none of distinctive facial features of individuals with Down Syndrome - what people in general see different in them the most. I'd be wondering why they pretend they make me feel represented when they don't - and why. Do they think I'm ugly?  Also with the hard of hearing Barbie - what changes do you make? Big hearing aids? Bipolar Barbie, prescription bottles?\n\nIn this case they had a home run with being able to clearly 'brand' the doll - make her look like individuals with Down Syndrome. Insulting to them I think.\n\nSorry co-opted this. I was just glad to see someone had the same thought about the doll's appearance.",

The company had worked closely with the National Down Syndrome Society to ensure the doll accurately represented a person with Down syndrome.   \n\nThe doll's dress features butterflies, as well as yellow and blue colors \u2014 associated with Down syndrome awareness. Accessories that include a pendant necklace with three chevrons represents the three copies of the 21st chromosome. The doll also comes with ankle foot orthotics, which many children with Down syndrome use for support.\n\n\"This Barbie serves as a reminder that we should never underestimate the power of representation,\" said Kandi Pickard, NDSS president and CEO, in a press release. \"It is a huge step forward for inclusion and a moment that we are celebrating.\"\n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barbie-down-syndrome-doll-introduced-by-mattel/",

She's literally a pale redhead.\n\nLike it has nothing to do with racism.\n\nIf The Princess and the Frog cast a white actress I bet you'd be up one side of twitter and down the other screaming about it.\n\nLike I genuinely could not care less, I never liked the live action Disney films, but it's very strange selective blindness to see it as a black and white issue (no pun intended). Obviously \\*some\\* people are mad because of racism but most are likely just mad about the egregious double standards at play.\n\nedit: lol the downvotes pretty much just highlight that i'm correct. There's no real counter argument because what I said is purely factual...so reddit relies on downvotes. Go for it if it makes you feel better, karma is a worthless metric.  \n\n  \n\nedit edit: In the interest of being far too correct here, I figured i'd add one final dunk for the future college class that inevitably sifts through the cyber ruins of reddit for information on the past and what went wrong...  \n\nAs a simple example of double standards, when Disney's live action Aladdin was coming out social media went berserk frothing at the mouth screaming about Jasmine's actress...because she didn't look brown enough....despite the fact the actress, Naomi Scott, is part Indian and clearly fit the role. The mere idea of a person too white to play Jasmine set social media on fire.  \n\nSo yes. If you're one of the morons incorrectly screaming \"DAS RECISM\" to simply point out why people would be upset they pointlessly race-swapped Ariel, there ya go. I couldn't possibly me more right and as usual reddit proves downvotes don't actually, shockingly, disprove the truth.  \n\nIt's honestly entertaining no one can actually have a good faith argument and instead begins screaming racism like it's a silver bullet argument.  \n\nDiversity is best gained by creating new characters, not race-swapping established ones. Look at how Miles Morales was handled, excellent way to add diversity. Same for Moana, Tiana and Mirabel. Excellent efforts to add diversity.  \n\nSee y'all nerds later. This has been my dunk talk.",

The first thing I thought when I saw this is \"I bet people in the comments are going to say it doesn't look enough like down syndrome because they have ableist preconceptions about people with downs\" and then I went to the comments and that was the case.\n\nAs for if *I* also think that, I haven't even seen what the barbie looks like bc I didn't click the link. I just know Barbies are generally made to appear conventionally attractive, and reddit commenters are pretty damn predictable, so I just made a (clearly accurate) series of assumptions from those points.",

But certainly an assumption! \n\nHave you ever been to Mexico City?  Or likely any major latin metropolis?  Look at the people on magazine covers in the markets, then look at the people in the streets around you.  You will notice that on Mexican magazines there are a hell of a lot of \"blonde\" actresses and lightskinned models with small noses and thin eyebrows, etc.  100% Mexican, mind you...but not really authentic to Mexican culture, history, or native history.  A version that's reflects the dominant version of beauty inside a media shaped by its vicinity to white culture.  Nobody would say that Aztec features are ugly.  That's not the measuring stick being used in any sense. \n\nNoting that the doll doesn't reflect Downs symptoms doesn't equal saying they are ugly.",

Before the days of IG, it was pretty normal to hear young girls be compared with \u201cBarbie-like\u201d features. \n\nEthnic barbies, thick barbies, even LGBT barbies makes sense to me, but down syndrome isn\u2019t like the rest. Sexualization of a Down syndrome Barbie feels \u2026icky, to put it mildly.",

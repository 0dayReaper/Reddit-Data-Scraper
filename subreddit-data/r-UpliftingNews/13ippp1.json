Well, lo and behold, the next day there's an ad in the Pueblo newspaper for help in a group home with adolescents. I called a number, filled out an application, and she hired me. And I saw so many neat kids, I thought, 'I can do this.'\"\n\nIn the 34 years since, Cora and Stan have raised more than 130 foster children in their home.\n\n\"The years went by and we've had so many wonderful young men,\" Cora said. \"We've had some in prison; they call us on a Sunday. We have one that's in New York and married with two children. When he turned 18, he joined the U.S. Navy and we got a letter from his commanding officer about what a wonderful young man he was. At age 7, they didn't want me to take him because they said he was 'too damaged.'\"",

I would love to foster but ours is all done through the government.  We tried and gave up, they were so ridiculous.",

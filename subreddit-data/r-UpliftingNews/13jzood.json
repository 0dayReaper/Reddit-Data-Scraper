Conversely, my Corsair keyboard has been pissing me off because it's simultaneously near-impossible to dismantle and also **not waterproof**. Every time a tiny drop of condensation makes it from a Coke can between a key, my keyboard freaks out for a while until it dries, and there's basically nothing I can do. If Logitech are going to be providing parts, I'm immediately more interested in a Logitech keyboard.\n\nI'd prefer it was a direct service from Logitech, but I also understand that this is going to be more sustainable from a business perspective if they can take advantage of iFixit's existing setup, so I'll take it.",

Who knows, but that could be good. Whatever happens, it's a step in the right direction if this actually gets set up and working, and is easy for the average user to make use of while not being prohibitively expensive.",

I think a large majority of those heart break stories could have been avoided if the winners had just done a few weeks of research on reputable financial advisors. \n\nLike if I won, I'd be hitting the internet to find out who is the best financial planner in NYC, Chicago and LA and then meet with each and go from there.  \n\nMy parents are upper middle class and in their 60s, I'd give them a bit but they are cool. No problems there.  I'm an only child so no siblings bullshit.  I have no first cousins, no uncles and no aunts.  I live across the country from where I grew up in the USA.  I'd move to Cambodia with my wife whom is a citizen there. We lived there before and I love the people and country.  Travel around and honestly, it'd be hard to even contact me.  I have 1 really good friend whom I'd hook up with enough money to sit him up for life.  We are in our early 30s.  Honestly, I'd just let him travel around with us, he's cool and wouldn't ask for any money in the first place.  We have no kids. \n\n",

They will give you the contact informations of other winners if they both want,  so they organize dinners together,  its very useful for those that were very poor to be around people like them.  \n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/RQ2Sp-oZTnI\n\nThis is a documentary on the lady that gives you the money and does the follow up and organizes the lessons for winners.

Reasoning being: a homeless person can scrub the hell out of themselves and put on clean clothes, but feet get so fucking fucked up (dirt ground into them semi-permanently, taking weeks to erode from surface epidermal layers.  It was a big enough deal that at that time, in those few homeless months, I nailed down feet/toes as the inescapable signs of homelessness, harder to erase quickly than smell or clothes.",

Made the best decision I could with the info I had at the time and recouped the cost of the gear we had purchased. I kept 10 just on the off chance something crazy would happen like them going to 10k each. \n\nThat account is worth $55,000 as of this morning.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, regret is for chumps! Look forward and be at peace with the decisions you've made knowing that hindsight is always 20/20 and a new opportunity is always around the corner\n\nproof: [https://i.imgur.com/3Byexs7.png](https://i.imgur.com/3Byexs7.png)\n\nedit: I should also mention that pretty much every bitcoin user who traded in any \"large\" amounts of coins back then could claim this kinda story (if they stopped mining/hoarding like we did at any point). It's like saying, \"if I had only purchased a shitload of Apple stock back when Microsoft owned the world!\" or \"if I had only bet everything I own on black 26 that time it came up on roulette\"\n\nedit2: just to recap, from my point of view I woke up this morning with $55,000 I never expected to get. hell of a good morning :)",

People keep using that as an argument for doing the 26 years, but it's still a stupid idea. It would be so much more valuable in a trust fund. What happens if the state goes bankrupt, like my state Illinois, and refuses to pay out lottery winnings? You're fucked. \n\nAlways take the lump sum. If you want it for your kids/grandkids. Put it in a trust, in their names. Invest the rest in things that you cannot directly touch, except the dividends. Do your research, make sure they are the safest bets. Nothing is 100% but there are investments funds that are pretty close to that with pretty damn good ROI's. Don't invest in friends, and don't give loans to family.",

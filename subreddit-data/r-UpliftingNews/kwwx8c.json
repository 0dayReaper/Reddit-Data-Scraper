As a software engineer, I can say that it takes a certain personality type to be okay with hours of debugging and tracking down a seemingly random bug. Seen a lot of people in this industry who don't have that patience and end up hating their job or quitting the industry.",

If you aren\u2019t willing to track down those bugs, spend hours on figuring out regression test issues, unit test failures, and reading and fully understanding documentation before implementation, then this really is not cut out for you. That is why I think there is a fine line between being a software engineer and someone who writes code. There\u2019s a mentality and a mindset that you must possess, not for everyone",

Almost all of our work had to be done in these HUGE labs in the CSCI building.  I was really struggling with some project when a senior completely lost his shit.  He had a legit mental breakdown working on his senior project.  He destroyed about four cubicles before someone got him to calm down.  I realized I was probably on that path and decided to transfer to a different school and switch to Actuarial Science degree.  I work in Analytics now and make a comfortable living.

It's fantastic and I need to contribute for everything it's done for my daughter.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s no surprise that Khan Academy Kids, a free education app with no ads or in-app purchases that\u2019s designed for children ages 2 through 7, has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. Since school lockdowns began in March, more than 1.5 million people have created new accounts. Over the past two years, the app has been downloaded more than 8.5 million times.\n\n&gt;But that surge in usage has also become a source of stress for Khan Academy, a nonprofit organization that offers free online courses and gets most of its funding from donations. Sal Khan, the organization\u2019s founder and executive director, says the kids app alone is racking up deficits of about $3 million per year, and server costs have become a bigger concern than they once were. While Khan Academy Kids isn\u2019t in any immediate danger, the race is on for more funding to secure the app\u2019s future and help it grow further.\n\n\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90511211/covid-19-made-khan-academy-kids-vital-for-parents-now-it-faces-a-cash-crunch",

Education is the greatest investment in our future, and I can't think of anyone else who has provided it to as many people.\n\nSpeaking on a personal level, my school district didn't have a computer science program and without people like Sal providing free resources online, I'm doubtful I ever would have picked up coding.\n\nSome of you may have already seen my DataIsBeautiful posts on stuff like stock trading by politicians and corporate lobbying, but last week I closed a funding round for a [data site](https://www.quiverquant.com/) I built using my education in programming. It goes without saying that I'm incredibly grateful for those who have dedicated time and effort to teaching.\n\nEDIT: [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/donate) to Khan Academy's donate page",

Even the Peace prize states it is to be awarded to the person who in the preceding year \"shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and  promotion of peace congresses\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see that [Malala Yousafzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai) and [Kailash Satyarthi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailash_Satyarthi) won the [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Nobel_Peace_Prize) Peace prize in part for promoting \"the right of all children to education\", but I don't quite think Khan meets any of the other criteria directly.  You could argue (and I'd agree) that education will promote fraternity between nations, but it is in a fairly indirect way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, his work with Khan Academy is painfully unrecognized.  IMO he certainly deserves something like the [Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize](https://www.globalteacherprize.org/).",

Only thing that\u2019s annoying is if you want to make iOS apps you need Mac OS, you can try to make a windows PC run Mac OS (r/hackintosh), but it can be pretty annoying. Basically if your computer can run a web browser, a command prompt, and a text editor at the same time without crashing or becoming unbearably slow then you have everything you need to do basic coding.",

Don't they realize that he is just another pompous billionaire that truly doesn't give a shit about most people and things? He goes out of his way to avoid paying adequate taxes (which could help fund education, healthcare services and etc.) And he prevents his workers from unionizing in order to keep them from getting the treatment and benefits that they deserve. All while he is the richest man in the world. He is greedy, pompous and an all around vile person. One drop in the bucket good deed doesn't make him a redeemable person. But yes please continue to talk about how cool he is because he's on reddit and he likes anime./s",

They promise some kind of credential in a short amount of time that doesn't actually mean anything. The credits don't transfer to a university and it doesn't mean a lot when applying for jobs.\n\nUniversities and community colleges have a back room deal, of sorts. The CC offers the core basic classes, but not the degree specific classes a university offers. For my CC experience, there is a checklist of classes and once the student completed them, they could apply for a TAG. Transfer Admission Guarantee to one of the available state colleges.",

As an adult student, she had made friends with many of her CC professors along the way and all of them warned her off that particular professor if she had the option to take it at her 4-year school.

Many of the classes are offered at community colleges but usually it is 60 out of the 130 for highly technical degrees. Many degrees are done at 100-120 with general education credits taking up the rest to 120. \n\nMany community colleges will cover the math, science, and non-degree requirements that are the entry classes to the college. However, this makes the rest of the classes all technical which can be a pain. \n\nFor instance, usually circuits 1 is taken spring of year 1, circuits 2 is taken spring of year 2, and advanced circuits classes are taken sporadically years 3 and 4 mixed with general education credits. Instead, for transfers circuits 1 is fall of year 3 (transfer year), circuits 2 is taken spring of year 3, and advanced circuits classes are taken all of year 4.",

The CC you wrote about that offers those courses must be a technical CC or have that specific department to be able to offer those specific courses that students need.  That is great those are out there. My statement did not indicate ALL CCs. Statistically speaking, most CCs do not offer highly specialized courses- such as drafting,  electrical engineering, or circuits 1 or circuits 2; most CCs offer gen. ed. courses that fit the majority of degrees; that is one of the ways they are able to keep tuition &amp; fees lower. That is why for some degrees it is better to transfer after a year or skip CC and start at Uni so that the student can take the specialized sequential courses dispersed with the required gen. ed. courses. Otherwise, if they completed all gen. ed. courses at CC and then transfered, only the highly specific sequential courses would remain which would actually extend their amount of chronological time in education... they cannot take circuits 2 until they have completed 1. It is great there are technical CCs out there and that SOME CCs are able to provide some of these specialized courses.  I don't know why you commented \"not true\" in response  when I began my statement with the word 'many.' I wrote mine to be informative and helpful to answer someone's question. I am not sure why you wrote yours other than to be argumentative, dismissive, or maybe you have such a narrow world view that you think all CCs  offer Circuits 1 and 2.

STEM degrees aren't some magical thing where the costs massively go up. For undergraduate studies, they basically are the same costs. \n\nFor instance, the software used for most CAD based engineering classes is given free to universities as it keeps the graduates familiar with that software which helps push demand for the industrial use software that is way more expensive. For instance, solidworks is free with a .edu email for 4 years. After that, the yearly cost for the inventor usage is $100 a year that limits what you can do but allows you to stay familiar with it as long as you don't use it to sell large products. The business version? It starts at $5k a year for basic all the way up to $10k for the professional single use license. That doesn't include the add-ons which add thousands per year per license and can easily add up to $25k per year per license. \n\nThe equipment used is often donated or heavily subsidized to the point that it isn't relevant. Again, their goal is to familiarize students with the technology but the companies want them familiar with the brand and the usage of the brand.\n\nMy entire time in undergrad the total cost difference was labs where you paid extra beyond the regular credit costs to use them. \n\nOn top of that, the costs are different already. The lower level undergraduates get charged one tuition rate. The upper levels get charged the college rate which varies depending on the major. My major had a $1k per year increase from lower undergraduate. My friend who went the English degree route had his drop by $3k per year. That being said, the engineering school was smaller than the language/general arts school which likely accounts for the differences.",

Most community colleges will have a group of university's that they can transfer too and you get all the credits transferred, if you go to say an out of state college then yea even though business 101 is the same thing as business 1001 it still might not transfer. Even if some of the credits don't transfer its still way cheaper and saves money instead of getting room and board at the university for 2 years vs 4 years as an example. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you go to a community college first then transfer with all credits you can save like 10-50k depending.

Couldn't afford another year and a half at USC out of pocket and didn't want to come out $80k in debt. Should have just gone with the University of Washington. Oh well.",

You have to take classes based on the requirements of the school you want to transfer to.

State to state there could be as problem, but in the same state it should be easy and 100% for the same course.  Also keep in mind many of the adjuncts at the 4 year pick up the slack at the CC.",

I didn\u2019t say it was a bad thing. But you do know some people are smarter than others right? And that maybe they all shouldn\u2019t have to study the same things?  Do you think the bottom third should worry about French and trigonometry, that they\u2019ll never use? Or maybe get started on a trade, so they can make a decent living as soon as they graduate? \n\nMy cousin dropped out of high school. Why? Because he got into a fight with a French teacher. It just shouldn\u2019t even have happened. But a language is required to graduate for some reason. He sure didn\u2019t need it. And is now doing good as an appliance install and repair guy in his home town. But there were issues, and they stemmed from putting him in classes he didn\u2019t need. \n\nIf the other people wanna do a trade as well, they can. No one\u2019s stopping them.",

Some people just learn differently than others.  Other people are afflicted with disorders like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, hell even good old-fashioned depression, all of which can have drastic effects on educational outcomes at a young age.\n\nI myself had ADHD and was never diagnosed or treated as a child.  The complete lack of impulse control and executive functioning meant that while I could pass every single test put in front of me, generally with a 90% or higher, I absolutely never did my homework.  Or if I did, it was in a rush before class, on the bus, etc, so it was never fully completed.\n\nI was not stupid or unintelligent.\n\nI pulled my dismal GPA up my senior year through sheer force of will (and my parents absolutely punishing and berating me at every moment to ensure I had my work done and turned in) but it was a living nightmare that had long-term effects on my mental health.\n\nToday I work in tech, doing better than I ever thought that I would, as a principal engineer at a company you would know immediately if I mentioned their name, as we're number one globally in our area of expertise.\n\nHad I gone to a school that had been reworked like you suggested, I would likely be fixing air conditioners or doing carpentry (both of which I've done, and enjoy, but were not the career for me.)  I would never have reached my full potential, because I'd have been shoe-horned into a job by a system that wasn't designed to deal with people who learn the way that I do.\n\nRestructure the system so it can more accurately identify and support people with mental disorders and the like.  You'd be surprised at how many people you think (or that they themselves think) are unintelligent or cognitively not capable of higher learning, who in fact have just never had the right level of support.  They'd surprise you, I think, with what they're capable of.",

I'll admit our local community college is *really good*.\n\nThey were smaller classes with quality professors that were more involved with the students, compared to a professor teaching multiple classes of 50-100 students. The professors were good at their jobs and not burnt out. We also had quality labs and equipment -- and plenty of time to use them since we weren't competing with countless other students for access.\n\nThe fact that the students and faculty were less overworked and less stressed showed. And everyone was motivated to be there, vs \"I'm here because it's expected and it's my first time away from home.\"",

Ex.  Class A might be accepted for university credit, but might not be accepted for the particular college or degree program within the university (think UofI Schools of Engineering or Business that have higher standards than the university at large.  So, the credit counts towards graduation, but it.migjt not count towards your specific degree.\n\nGo to CC, take your Gen Ed classes, confer with the 4 year school to see how they will transfer in.  Do we really need more legislation to get involved in this?",

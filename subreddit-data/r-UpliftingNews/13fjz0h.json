They just did, no argument, no discussion. Just an acceptance that this is her name and using it and that that is her gender, and referring to her as such. I think that it speaks way more than any specific recognition in the legal decision, of the choice to do the right thing, could have.\n\nObviously the decision references her being trans, because that is why she is seeking asylum, and that is where the legal question existed, but I think this was a very good thing overall. May we only be so lucky as to have it continue.",

I do not think that a woman can get out of bed and just declare herself a man, but I also acknowledge that gender dysphoria is a genuine struggle that we don't yet have a better treatment method for. The problem is that these people have pushed a political narrative where anyone who even *suggests* researching a way to make the mind line up with the body rather than the other way around is made a pariah and labeled a supporter of gay conversion therapy, even though sexual orientation is only tangentially related to gender identity.\n\nTrans folks, I understand that your condition is a genuine struggle, but you can't just arbitrarily redefine two existing words (man, woman) and then force those new definitions on the rest of society on pain of being labeled a bigot. Just because I don't agree with your weird ideas doesn't automatically mean I'm a bigot who wants to commit hate crimes against you, and behaving like it does risks alienating potential allies against the *actual* bigots demonizing you and calling you mutants, especially if said potential ally is still trying to wrap their heads around the very concept of a trans person.",

There is no right or wrong way for a man or a woman to look, so what does their anatomy have to do with the cultural artifact of gender? You can't tell what's in a person's pants by looking at them, so just ask for their pronouns instead. The less assumptions we make about our fellow people the better.",

Because it suggest that a man who declares himself a woman and starts wearing makeup and dresses is, indeed, still a man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, I fully acknowledge that what clothes men and women are and are not allowed to wear in any given culture is entirely arbitrary. But just because you aren't manly doesn't mean you're not a man.",

So if you and your buddy are being charged with conspiracy, you can't be compelled to testify against him, because doing so would tend to incriminate yourself as well. \n\nBut, if you cannot be charged with the crime because you have accepted a pardon, you can be compelled to testify against your buddy. The pardon means your testimony cannot incriminate you, so forcing you to testify does not infringe on your right against self incrimination. \n\nThis came about because a member of the press was asked to reveal a source. He refused, claiming that being forced to testify would incriminate himself.  He was offered a pardon, and then ordered to testify, under penalty of contempt of court.  SCOTUS ruled that he was not compelled to accept the pardon; that accepting the pardon was tantamount to an admission of guilt.",

There are a few reasons why they would not do an automatic pardon. Legitimate offenses may have been linked to a same sex activity offense such as child sexual offenses, rape, or any other current offence that may have been linked and they do not want these to be expunged. Additionally, reviewing all of the repealed/abolished offenses would require an immense amount of legal work and may not be possible to review all and be done in a timely manner. Another big reason is privacy. People hid their sexuality especially so in the past, and they may have hidden this conviction from their families and others. In clarifying particular cases and seeking information, whether certain relationships were consensual or not for example, may lead to outing this individual which could be a breach of their privacy. considering compensation for victims becomes a problem too, as they are saying these convictions were wrong and are now being pardoned leads to potential compensation and the problems that go with that. Having it be an application process, although not being perfect it does mitigate more problems than it creates.\n\nThis is just for thought but these people knew the offense was wrong and did it anyway (again it never should have been wrong but that's how the world was/is). Should we base and change history to reflect our modern views? Furthermore removing it discounts their bravery and shows how even through adversity and severe consequences they chose to do it anyway because they believed it to be right. Removing that may alter future perspectives of the time. \n\nHope this helps understand some of the difficulties of this issue but regardless of how it's being conducted it's a good sign of progressive thinking \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk",

What, are we just going to keep going up the stack until we find the single most oppressed person in the world and tell everyone else to fuck off because they have it easier?\n\n&gt;Historically, cis straight men have had the least struggles\n\nAnd that's relevant to boys in 2023... how? You can't cite the 1950's as proof that a black 19-year-old boy with autism living in the projects over half a century later has massive privilege.\n\n&gt;while the rights of women and the LBQTIA + community have always had to be fought for\n\nRight, which is why we should fight for equal rights for those groups as well. We didn't say, \"welp, women's suffrage passed, let's pack up and go home\". We didn't stop with the abolishment of segregation. If you want an equal world you have to keep fighting for everyone, otherwise it's just taking turns.\n\n(Also gay/bi/trans men exist, so you really only care about 50% of LGBT)\n\n&gt;Our rights to healthcare, educate and right now, to even exist are actively being fought against\n\nThat's why you fight for more than one group at once. \"Sorry Black Lives Matter, we need to work on trans rights rn.

Not sure how high the prison sentence would've been in his case specifically, but generally, his offense of \"gross indecency\" was punishable with a life sentence.

Men before this time were prosecuted for homosexuality, and both men and women faced punishments from the army if they were active service members. Men have been able to apply for pardons for years, but as the issue overwhelmingly only applied to men (as outside of the military women were exempt from the laws), women who were punished by the army were overlooked. This article is basically a really complicated way of saying that those women who faced punishments from the military are now also able to apply for a pardon",

Thomas Cromwell during the English reformation specifically chose 'buggery' as a punishable crime as it showed Parliament had the power to rule on matters previously dealt with by the Church, and during the dissolution of the Monasteries the Crown claimed to have found evidence of homosexuality among Monastic orders, thus being a means to prosecute former monk/priests who had been defrocked for refusing to accept the Statue in restraint of appeals.  \n\nWhile the 1533 Act banned 'Buggery' but didn't define it, its made anal sex and bestiality punishable but not oral sex, as the British legal system led to a precedent of people being acquitted for the latter but any male homoerotic acts were treated as a precursor to or 'attempted buggery'.",

Twisting this into a 'they are all bigots' seems like a really problematic approach. Puberty blockers aren't new, how they are used has however changed, that is new, and it's fairly important to justify use where there are risks.  That really should come from the NHS/NICE/the various colleges of medicine, who are in a position to understand what the issue is shouldn't it?",

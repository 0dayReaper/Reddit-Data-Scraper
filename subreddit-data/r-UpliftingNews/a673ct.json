It\u2019s important to keep in mind that it\u2019s a process and nothing is forever.  Also important to know is that you are never alone, no matter how alone you feel. There are always people to talk to, even if you don\u2019t have recourses for a counsellor. The world can seem like it\u2019s nothing but a cold place and everyone is selfish but there are also a lot of good people and positive things to focus on. Like I said, one step at a time. ",

My friend actually met and talked with Keanu before a film, I forget which, but he said there were a few other recognizable people in the audience but Keanu was there before just talking with people in the lobby and then bought some popcorn and went in to watch the film. He seems like a pretty chill guy. He\u2019s also seen at car shows and auto events around the area, like the races in Long Beach. ",

SO when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in, but Keanu Reeves. I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Keanu, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Keanu put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.",

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\nHe said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

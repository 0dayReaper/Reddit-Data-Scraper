An introduction to legal speak for me was laearning all the by laws in my town about waste disposal, tree cutting, property rights etc. Any time I was unsure I asked my lawyer friend and his answer was either no and this is why or yes you completely understand it as written but there is always an argument to be made about how it is interpreted and enforced and that's why there are so many lawyers. Not all situations can ever be covered and a law tries to give a blanket idea.",

And everything depends on the situation and surroundings.\n\nPlus the funny part about law is that every branch of law is basically about finding the laws that support your case. Only in criminal law it's mainly about interpreting the law in a way that supports your case and convincing the judge that this interpretation is the right one in this case.",

Many years later, despite not only  being blind but also after having to learn English as a second language, he managed to secure a place at Oxford university to study law. However there was the small problem that none of the text books were written in braille so he needed a reader to help him. This reader happened to be a fellow oxford student studying english and the two of them built up somewhat of a relationship during their time together and a few years later they got married. The reader was of course my grandma.",

The article is in Turkish and Google translate garbled a lot of the sentences, so I can't tell if she did. Of course, the professor would've put *some* things on the board, requiring her to borrow notes, but I just want to know if they did try that.",

I used to work for an attorney who was mostly paralyzed from the neck down.

He would use the eraser to turn pages, and click the  pen with his chin when he wanted to take notes.  He was a very prolific trial attorney and his physical condition never seemed to slow him down.

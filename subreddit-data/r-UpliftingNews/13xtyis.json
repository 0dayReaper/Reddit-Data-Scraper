The short haul flights are only banned where there is a high-speed train connection, and then there are some conditions as well.  So although a step in the right direction, not all that crazy of a change as it may seem.",

That is too odd imo. A vehicle with way more people inside that should be way more efficient is more expensive. How can that be the case? Well, i would guess heavy mismanagement. That should be worked on massively especially because of the climate. This would cause way less people beeing against banning in-country flights.",

I had generally affirming support since I was a child, now that I am bald, I shave my head almost daily and so I have a daily gender affirming action. \n\nSome of these people haven't seen a gay person in TV before recently, openly gay person in business, and thats just gay of the lgbtq+... it hurts. \nMy dad is gay, he came out at 50 years old, and you fucking bet we all support him! He hid himself from himself and the world for 50 FUCKING YEARS and were gonna help him be the best version of himself he can be. My mother to this day, like 10-15 years later hangs out with him. \n\nPride parades are amazing, they are fun, safe feeling, inviting, electrifying even! I can't imagine hating these people who have been historically been suppressed for forever, and then supporting the suppression of them more. Down here in florida I moved to be closer to the fiances family and pride is huge here and its super weird for people to be upset and hate their neighbors. \n\nIf you see pride stuff and get upset, maybe you un-american pos need to leave America, cause this is 'murica! Home of the free, land of the brave, and I'm brave enough to protect my brothers and sisters and nbies to love and live their fucking lives.",

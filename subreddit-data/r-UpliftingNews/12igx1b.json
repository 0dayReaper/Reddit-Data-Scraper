The companies they take over aren't supposed to survive - they suck all of the money out of them and torch what's left.  Toys R Us had an exclusive contract with Amazon and were expected to do well - until a Hedge Fund took it over, borrowed billions to pay their own consulting company (that didn't need to be there), then left them stuck them with the loan, which they couldn't pay.  \n\nIt's no different than Ray Liota's character in Goodfellas describing how mob bosses would take over local businesses and use their credit line until there was nothing left, then torch the place for the insurance money.\n\n\"One man with a briefcase can steal more than 100 men with guns.\"\n\n-The Godfather",

Hedge funds want the value of the company to go up or down based on their bets.\n\nPrivate equity on the other hand, tends to take over firms and make money by making the company more profitable or selling the company for parts if they think the parts are worth more than the whole.\n\nThis is a major simplification but you get the point. Neither are necessarily evil. For example, I've heard of a PE firm that specializes in buying Amazon storefronts and drop shipping companies because they know how to optimize that.",

That incentivizes them to maximize shareholder value to make more money for themselves. Since cutting out the local workers is cheaper for the same product, the system pays them to do it. At least that was the case until COVID\u2026",

Wages are slowly going up and are definitely going to keep climbing because there is a lot of desperation to get people to stay longer than a few months. Yes, a few months. Turnover is insanely high and this isn't like it's an awful Amazon facility. People are getting fairly significant pay bumps every few months bouncing between companies.\n\nWages and benefits don't just go through the roof overnight.

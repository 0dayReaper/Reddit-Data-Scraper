She\u2019s so incredibly proud of being from that country and gets excited whenever she sees it.\n\nBeing from unstable countries is weird and you tend to have a love, hate relationship with it. My mom had a problem with the politics and military, her problem wasn\u2019t with the old lady at the corner shop or her buddy from high school. Her interactions with the regular every day people and the beauty of her home country shaped her attitude and values. Her birth certificate and degree still says her home country on it. \n\nIm an American, and I\u2019ll complain about this country and how it treats its minorities and how the military operates and the people who run our government, but my upbringing here is so fundamental to how my values and identity developed that not being proud of where I\u2019m from would be like denying who I am.",

The people you interact with will surely appreciate your culture when they get to know you. \n\nIt just seems to me that it is like displaying your difference. I knew some french meeting in a french owned restaurant in germany, also a  latin-american group. None of them showed any signs but were really nice and interesting people.\n\nMaybe it\u2018s also something about perceived injustice.

Able to strike down a hundred men on the field of battle alone, a danger to his own men as much as the enemy he would be sent forth to fight on his own! He fought against gods and monsters!\"\n\n\"What was his greatest battle!\"\n\n\"Like that time he killed a dog with a throwing stick and took its place until a new dog could be found. Or that time Mebd tried to steal a cow.\"\n\nOr how Finn McCool tends to solve all his problems through being smarter, trickier or more humble than his enemy rather than by just being better at them than everything like other heroes.",

Since then, they've been a big part of the success of the \"Canadian Breadbasket\" (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). And on a personal note, my Ukrainian librarian in primary school taught some of us the basics of Ukrainian egg painting during our lunch hour just to share a piece of her culture. I really enjoyed melting the wax and attempting pretty designs.  \n\n\nThis is absolutely awful what's happening right now. And it's tragic that from time to time in history, people have to leave their home to survive.   \n\n\nBut FWIW, almost 100 years into first welcoming them, Ukrainians have been some of the best immigrants Canada could've have asked for. I for one would happily welcome more if they were looking for a home.",

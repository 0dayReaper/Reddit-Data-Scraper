In California, it would generate about 70.000kwh of electricity per year if I didn't fuck up my math, so about twice as much as needed.\n\nSo wtf is wrong here? No insulation at all? Ac set to 12degC? Solar farm for the whole neighborhood?\n\nI mean, Germany is not really known for low electricity costs, cheap labor or low taxes, so I can't understand how you guys are getting fucked that hard.",

It's not simply a matter of placing them in multiple places and leaving them to generate power ad infinitum.\n\nAnd Singapore's past of buying sand for construction projects from these countries, often at the expense of their own construction needs, has soured the idea of selling what is essentially their own eco-friendly futures to some other country.\n\nPlus, many of Singapore's neighbors have periods of recent instability, both environmentally (earthquakes / typhoons) and politically (military coups and dictatorships). Do you think Singapore, a famously stable nation, would want to peg something as important as it's energy supply to countries that may end up with a dictator who will try to blackmail Singapore by threatening to literally pull the plug?  Of Singapore's neighbors, Malaysia has the highest stability rating, but it's still forty places down from Singapore. Australia actually has a *higher* stability rating than Singapore.",

Batteries are cheap enough today to grab a share of the market, which makes them cheaper via economies of scale, which enables them to grab a larger market. It's quite deterministic.\n\nA small volume of grid-connected batteries will be useful between today and 2030. For instance they can easily compete with gas peakers, but not necessarily with baseload plants, and they can sell ancillary services like frequency regulation and voltage support. A larger volume of batteries will be necessary to support a 100% renewable policy, which would happen after 2030.\n\nWind turbines, solar modules and hydrogen electrolyzers [follow similar cost and adoption curves](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/energy_transition_paper-INET-working-paper.pdf), for similar reasons.",

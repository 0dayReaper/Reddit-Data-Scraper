Maybe we just see thin, unachievable bodies with tons of upvotes and we assume this is what people what to see when the actual process of the content creator getting to that point is muddled. Unless they\u2019re blatant about \u201cthrow up and be hot\u201d, we will just fill in the blanks and simply glamorize being fit instead of looking at things as being unhealthy when maybe it is. Same with most social media, I suppose. At least youtube can\u2019t be liable since they put an asterisks on certain videos\u2026",

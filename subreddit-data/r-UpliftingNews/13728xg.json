Equally, being equal to all genders could be great to promote female sports as a more traditional sports bar (but one that will presumably cater to a crowd more biased to females than the usual bars).",

But where the metaphor breaks down for me is where we conflate the different 'colors' with labels such as race, nationality, political party, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Imagine if we divided our neighborhoods in such a way. Or our school districts. It's not right to do in those cases, and it's not right to do in commercial districts.\n\nSo I'd plead for a logically consistent morality that can be universally applied to anyone. That's not being a invasive 'gray' person. That's admitting that we are all part of the same human family, and all deserve respect.",

The next year we got a beer leaguer from Argentina who was more technically proficient.  \nI've also watched the sport of both men's and women's soccer for about the same amount of time..   \nIt's not close.

Straight guys don't watch men's sports to look at muscles. We watch it to see what athletes can do with these muscles, how far they can take their gifts and skills. \nI will never say that women don't have skills. Professional female athletes are better and will beat 99% of casual population and I applaud them for their dedication to the craft and skills they possess. Unfortunate reality as you mentioned yourself is that men are physically stronger and that allows them to showcase their skill in more entertaining way, and this is what everyone wants - entertainment.",

And to me its the same value watching someone better than me do something doesn't matter if she's twice as good as me or he's ten times as good me: I learn from each just the same and that's why I love watching sports.\n\nI noticed that a lot of people who are really into watching sports don't really do much sport at all... So instead of competing in sports they compete on who watches and supports the best players? Maybe this power dynamic fills the empty hole in their life that lack of exercise brings?\n\nMaybe I digress. I don't know. Watching fit women do sports is fun.",

If you bring the goals much closer, girls will be able to kick like guys with further goals. It's the question of power. Of course girls will not be able to kick as hard as guys. But when it comes to pure skill it's competition! As the videos I shared prove. Can you control the ball like them??",

However I feel like it's a long term bad business decision to limit yourself like that.\n\nOnce the novelty rush is over, you're gonna function just like any bar. In fact, if the niche audience proves this successfull, you'll have competitors.\n\nWhen that happens, I'd imagine there are dates in which limiting yourself to women's sports will be financial suicide. In my country (Argentina) for instance, no one (not even women) would bother to go there during the month of a World Cup. The entire country becomes 100% obssessed with the event to the point you can even follow the match result without tv or radio by simply listening to the screams of GOAL in the street. [An example here](https://youtube.com/shorts/C51qM-OcIZ8?feature=share3)\n\nI'd imagine something similar would happen in the USA during Olympics and the Superbowl.\n\nI might be completely wrong, since I don't know american bar culture, but I think as more competitors start appearing you will not be able to afford to be that restricted in what you show. At least you couldn't do it where I live. This is why even here shops will show you Las Leonas (argentina's successfull female hockey team) matches during a hockey world cup. Because they can't afford to ignore the event.",

Not sure there\u2019s a women\u2019s sporting event that goes up against the Super Bowl, so I\u2019m not sure what they do then.\n\nAs for the other thing, serving women who like sports in Portland is about the best place to do it.

They should be paying the full costs of their business model, not externalizing costs back on to taxpayers in the form of alcoholism and DUIs.\n\nFor bars to be worth celebrating their business model needs to include a way to realistically guarantee the customers have safe transportation while getting intoxicated for profit and 99.999% don't do that.\n\nInstead they pocket the profits and then pass the externalized costs back on to society alcoholism, DUI's and increase domestic violence.\n\nNot cool, alcoholism still kills more people than fentanyl!\n\nIt's kind of like considering the success of your local fentanyl dealer to be uplifting news. You could legalize fentanyl all you want just like alcohol but it still wouldn't really be uplifting news. It would still be you making money from people's addictions and society paying the price.",

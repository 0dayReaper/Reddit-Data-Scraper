You are correct in saying that the effect of that era can be felt today. That fear of AIDS is still very real, and for good reason! The disease can hide until the patient requires hospitalization. I have met newly diagnosed patients whose disease was so advanced they had severe neurological damage (e.g. could not write properly). So many newly diagnosed patients have a healthy fear of the disease that we capitalize on to emphasize the importance of medication adherence. As long as you take your pill, you will be okay. And if you don't have insurance, please research the **Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program** in your county. Contact your county's health department and ask for Ryan White case management. There is housing assistance available as well.\n\n\nI hope this reaches anyone who is out of care, from HIV or mental health or anything else. Take your medicine. If you don't have a support system, there are strangers out there who love you and want you to be well. Find them. Look for case management or whatever help you need.",

Powerful antiretrovirals that, when taken prior to or just after exposure to HIV, will almost always prevent infection (99%+ of the time?)\n\nIf you can get to a doctor or hospital within a day or so of exposure they'll start you on a high dosage to prevent you from developing HIV (even though its already in your body). You continue taking this medicine for 28 days. This is Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)\n\nIf you have a high chance of being exposed and you know it in advance, you can take much smaller doses indefinitely and prevent HIV, even when directly exposed. This is Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\n\nBoth can be the same drugs in different dosage.\n\nIf you are exposed to HIV, even if you think you might have been, go to a hospital and tell them and you can ask for PEP. It is super expensive so dont treat it like aspirin, its an emergency measure, but it is an effective one.\n\nEDIT: See below for more, both Truvada and Tivicay can be PrEP or PEP. Both are more effective when used in conjunction with safe sex. \n\nBoth are effective for ALL GENDERS. HIV does not discriminate and neither do these drugs. Stay safe.\n\nDO NOT BE AFRAID TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.",

The side effects are so low as to be non-existent and insurance will pay for it. If I had a biologically male kid who was interested in sex with men I would encourage them to go on it, just like I would get my biologically female daughter interested in sex with men some form of birth control. It's just smart and avoids devastating consequences for temporary lapses in judgement that we all have.",

And before then, the YMCAs were known as cruising grounds (which is what the Village People were singing about..) \n\nBut AIDS certainly squashed a majority of that. Having bareback sex was playing Russian Roulette. My point is, the sex-first obsession gay men have is so draining. Every app for gay dating asks if you want to be penetrated or not. No one just sits down and has a nice dinner.",

I'm 40, he was barely older than me.\n\nMost of my family is painfully conservative and evangelical Christian, so you can just imagine what life was like for him as a gay man. He was not in denial about his sexual orientation but he did try to hide it or avoid the subject with certain family members. I'll never know for certain why but my guess is that something about this made him reluctant to get tested regularly or go on preventative medications like Prep.\n\nBy Christmas of 2018 my wife and I could tell there was something not right. He was losing a lot of weight fast and just didn't seem like himself. By the end of 2019 he was going downhill fast and was eventually hospitalized, at which point he was diagnosed with AIDS and although they tried to treat him at that point it was too late. He died August of this year.\n\nHe would always spend Thanksgiving at our house because he was welcome exactly as he was and didn't have to pretend. He was good company and always insisted on helping us fix things or do electrical work for us (he was a talented electrician) around while he was visiting. Never asked for anything. The only cousin of mine that would randomly drop me a line to ask me how me and the family was doing.\n\nSo ya... sorry to be a downer in the upliftingnews sub but just had to share.",

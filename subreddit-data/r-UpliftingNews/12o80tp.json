There is plenty of space to house a population of that size.\n\nScientific questions will likely deal more with coping with or attempting to reverse climate change.

Distributing wealth more equally may sound awesome. But growing the average living standard of a huge sum of people will generally cause a vast increase in CO2 emissions.\n\nThat being said, I am still waiting for the problem also being tackled my restricting the biggest companies in the world.\n\nThe actual biggest problem to climate change is that it needs to be \"solved\" by addressing a million issues from all angles at the same time. Money lobbying is sure to scew this away from big corps tho",

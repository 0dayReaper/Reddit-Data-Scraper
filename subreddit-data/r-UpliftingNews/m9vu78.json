The developers realized the fine they would get for taking them down would be cheaper than building around the them, so they quickly pulled down as many as they could. I think only one was saved by someone alerting authorities, and I'm pretty sure it eventually died due to the damage that was done to and around it.

In some jurisdictions the fines are 3x replacement cost - which with very old trees and the scope of damage can turn into 7 figures+.

It's one of the only remaining TB hospitals and a national historic place where significant advances in TB care were made. It sits on a hill so the city wanted it torn don for housing. They wouldn't grant a business license unless they renovated it into something that's approved, which is pretty bs because it already pulls a lot in from tours. IMO I think it should be renovated into a living museum to look like it did during operation. Developers just like to ruin anything of historical significance. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverly_Hills_Sanatorium",

And the wall is listed so it's illegal to knock it down. \n\nThey decided to pay some cowboy to demolish it anyway, expecting a fine and then they'd get their second access point and make their money back developing the property. Instead they were ordered to pay a specialist stonemason to reconstruct the wall exactly as it had been, out of the original stone, which apparently cost an absolute fortune.

Everyone knows what these developers are doing but the law sides with \"enterprise\" (aka money) over community I guess.\n\n[The recent Australian case:](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-06/developers-who-demolished-corkman-pub-carlton-have-fines-slashed/11486120)\n\nDevelopers bought a historic pub which was then damaged by arson (\"persons unknown\"), they then illegally demolished it entirely, proposing to build apartments on the site.  They were originally ordered to rebuild it, but that order failed on appeal.  They were then ordered to clear the site and turn it into public space until the redevelopment could begin (apparently the harshest legal thing the council could do).

I saw a similar thing in Los Angeles about 10 years ago, a Real Estate Developer bought a mid-sized apartment complex on a very desirable street close to downtown, began a process of evicting all the tenants some who had lived there for 20+ years. The old building was remodeled into a \"modern  upscale\" development and charged new renters a fortune. But holy criminals batman!  A few of the older residents sued the Real Estate Company, they won in court, big!   The Real Estate Company lost many millions of dollars as they were ordered by the court to find all the former tenants they could locate, several had died, and it gets even better, if the former tenants wanted, they could have their former apartments remodeled again if they wanted, back to their original design, or move right in to the newly remodeled  apartments, and better yet, still pay the same rent they had been paying before they were evicted by the Real Estate Company.  I kid you not, i was selling carpet for a flooring company back then, and a little old lady in a wheelchair!  they even evicted a Grandma in a wheel chair! started crying as she told me this horror story of being thrown out of her apartment, trying to find a new place to live that was still affordable, with Social Security and likley disability to live on. It sent a message to developers back then, don't bend/break the rules for your own personal gain, the law back then In Los Angeles City, was rent could be increased a maximum of 4% a year.",

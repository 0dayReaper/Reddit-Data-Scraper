They\u2019re counting those 1000 calls as crimes that didn\u2019t happen.  We\u2019re not preventing crime here, in the sense that crime won\u2019t happen.  We\u2019ve just eliminated paperwork for police and these incidents would have been trespasses or whatever low level BS.\n\nThis is a useful service but it\u2019s not solving homelessness or the other big problems.  This isn\u2019t even the blood stopper.  This is the ibuprofen to alleviate the swelling and pain but the bone is still broken.  Totally fine with these programs but I question the programs ability to make long term change.  But it\u2019s definitely one part of a needed solution.",

People need regular ass housing and access to free therapy/psychiatry.\n\nLet me be clear, you NEED the housing. You need to factor in that these people are:\n\nDecompressing from years of your brain operating in an entirely different mode (survival mode) from the rest of society which is a lot in itself. \n\nThen you factor in the reality that pretty much everyone in society has treated you as if you aren't even human. \n\nPolice interactions in general are unpleasant at best. \n\nAny multitude of other horrendous things that are likely to happen you as well. \n\nIt takes..

Because surprise surprise police have a strong tendency to increase tension and encourage violence, not always at the fault of the officer but because the presence of \u201cthe cops\u201d scares people. I\u2019m not blaming cops, but if individuals want to risk their safety because they believe that they would have a better chance safely helping someone, ok. We\u2019re not drafting young men and women to go fight in the trenches, they\u2019re taking jobs to try and reach out to a vulnerable community that tends to have higher rates of mental illness.",

They are not who you want to help calm a crisis, because everyone will react with fear, hatred, resentment, etc to the implied threat of violence, which increases tensions and often causes the violence that we want to prevent. \n\nYou don\u2019t sit down for peace talks with your finger on the \u201cStart Nuclear War\u201d button. That\u2019s not how you get the other side to trust that you mean then no harm. \n\nCrisis workers are trained to deal with conflict without going nuclear, while cops are trained to go nuclear first and ask questions later. \n\nOk that\u2019s an exaggeration about cops, but not untrue. They aren\u2019t the best peace brokers because that\u2019s not what they are trained for. Crisis workers are better because that is what they are trained for. Just like firefighters are trained to stop fires and paramedics are trained to help in medical emergencies. Each has an area of expertise in which they are the best people to deal with that situation. \n\nI want cops to show up at a bank robbery. I want EMS for a heart attack . I want the FD when there\u2019s a fire. And I want crisis workers at domestic disagreements, or when a homeless person is having a mental breakdown.",

Will innocent people get hurt? Probably, probably in the same way delivery drivers or EMS get killed, raped or hurt. Shit happens, police die in the line of duty, EMS die in the line of duty, postal workers die in the line of duty.

Just as they are unable to solve the problem, someone living in an apartment doesn't necessarily want a bunch of homeless people camped outside their front door for various reasons. Their only effective recourse is to call the police and have them moved elsewhere, where they become someone else's problem. That's just the unfortunate reality, but saying that we should stop expecting the police to do anything doesn't make sense, because they're asked to do things by those same taxpayers.",

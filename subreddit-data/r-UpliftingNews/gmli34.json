Only got matched because the brother had moved to the US where they'd been(wrongly) told he had been adopted to and did a DNA test himself. \n\nAfter the story broke the adopted guy has been contacted by over 20 people suspecting something similar happened to them, including a girl from Ecuador.

However the agency on the adoptive side (where the baby lives) is paying people usually older women who may be teachers at the school or something similar to talk the parents who may be struggling with money or anything that if they sign this paperwork they will be sending their children to America for school. The parents want their children to have good educational opportunities so they sign the papers and never see their kids again. \n\nThe adoptive family isn\u2019t told this of course. They are told the child is an orphan or given away. And the one getting all the money? The agencies and woman who is convincing the family to do this. \n\nIt\u2019s horrific.",

The agencies have to look at least decently credible to not be shut down before the adoption can be finalized, but...  Even legitimate ones are often staffed by people who would rather see any baby grow up in a wealthier family in a developed country than with a poor (even by local standards) family in a developing country.\n\nPeople will do terrible things and tell many lies if they can spin it as \"saving\" a child and making a paycheck in the process.\n\nBeing poor isn't a crime.  Living in a country in crisis isn't a crime, and stealing a baby because you can give that baby more money isn't a virtuous act.",

In my country (Chile) there was a  government run children trafficking ring in the 80s, during a dictatorship. I know many countries in Latin America had the same problem during that time, especially Argentina. Some of the parents fully knew where the children came from, but the majority really didn't.\n\nEdit: in Argentina,  a cool group of women was created: \"Las Madres de la Plaza de Cinco de Mayo\". They would protest for their disappeared children, with small white baby blankets over their heads. Some of those mothers had their babies stolen by the goverment and nearly all of them were sold to rich families in Europe.",

Sometimes it is pitiful because it is a woman who is unable to bear children. But they still say to themselves \"I deserve a baby and I don't care about the moms feelings\" in their heads they probably convince themselves it is their baby anyway. \n\nSame is true of people buying children. Who do you think these customers are? You think they are eating these kids or something? People want children. For most it is the strongest biological drive. Fuck a mate and make some kids to pass on your genes.",

All testing and treatments are done in sight of the parents, when possible.\n\nVisitors must be buzzed in by the nurses\u2019 station. There are alarms on all exits that will sound if opened.

A half-hour later she called her roommate, who was visiting her family, to tell her how the date had gone. Although there are records of her cell phone being used over the next two hours, she has not been seen or heard from since that morning.[2]\n\nI can't believe you",

He presented us with proof that he had hired many detectives to try to find him.  Plus he brought 18 years of child Christmas gifts he had purchased for his son, including an electric train.  AND  proof that he had paid into a blind savings account showing he paid child support through college graduation.  \n\nThis man was a wonderful man and he never gave up.  He thankfully stayed where he was on the day that  my husband was taken.  I found him by snagging an old address book from my mother in law.",

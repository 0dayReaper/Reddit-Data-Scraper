The oil industry is seen as old and reliable; a known quantity; infrastructure and everything is already there, and there will be some demand for oil products for some time (albeit possibly declining in the future, but probably not too fast).\n\nIf you're just looking at energy generation, price per kWh, solar is cheaper, but the real world is not that simple. Petroleum products are used as high density fuel for transportation, and dispatchable energy.\n\nTo take full advantage of solar and wind, we also need storage and transmission infrastructure. As all of that is getting more investment, solar and wind will also get more and more investment. Additional strategies like green hydrogen production will replace petroleum products in other areas like shipping, aviation and industry.",

If there is any light outside, clouds or not, your solar can generate electricity. Not as much as completely unobstructed Sun sure. But people act like on a cloudy day the solar on your house is completely useless haha you idiot.\n\nEven on a fairly overcast day I can still be making a continuous 2KW off my panels. less than a sunny day but more than enough to match my use and charge my batteries since i don't often use more than 2KW continuously.\n\nIt's obviously a consideration you need to make when sizing your array if you're somewhere where it's cloudy extremely often you're going to want a larger array so that the lower generation days still meet your needs versus if you're somewhere where it's practically always open sun but they do not just become useless",

So it's important to site it in a smart way to minimize impact.\n\nSolar panel efficiency (output per unit area) has increased over time, but it still takes space.\n\nTherefore, it's an important issue to decide where to site solar panels to minimize impact. For utility-scale solar, you'd want to site it in areas that don't require damaging existing ecosystems (e.g. in areas that are already disturbed like brownfields (old industrial-use land), landfills, superfund sites; for small-scale urban solar panels, there is some rooftop and shade structure space.\n\n* [https://inovateus.com/how-many-square-miles-of-solar-panels-would-it-take-to-power-the-u-s-its-smaller-than-you-think/](https://inovateus.com/how-many-square-miles-of-solar-panels-would-it-take-to-power-the-u-s-its-smaller-than-you-think/)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2IVTM0N2SE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2IVTM0N2SE)\n* [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35097.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35097.pdf)\n\nAnyway, for my relevant observations with rooftop solar:\n\n1.

I think you need to do a bit of research regarding carbon sequestration\u2026there are companies actually reimbursing farmers for it. Row crops (cotton, corn, wheat, etc.) are great at it and they help the soil. Anyway, the whole point of this is to state we need to consider any and all sources of energy and the best ways to harness them. The fact that there are people who think solar is the answer is just flat wrong. My goal is to point out that it\u2019s not as environmentally friendly as once thought and oil isn\u2019t all bad.

In the long-run, this could undoubtedly save the life of someone you know.  Maybe even yourself.\n\nProof that positive things are still happening in the world that have the capacity to transform our perception of what life will be like in the future.",

Getting a mouse slighty wet causes the mouse to take in 19x the amount that passes the blood brian barrier under normal circumstances.\n\nThis new thing is great &amp; for all I know it's more efective &amp; would most likely be more easily replicated. Don't get me wrong here. I'm just really confused that oncologists aren't already using the science available. A whole lot of mast cell related science shows how easy it is to make mast cell degranulate.\n\nSoldiers in the Gulf War wound up with Gulf War Syndrome in part because of the oil fire pollution combined with the stress of being in a war zone. War zone stress would take down the blood-brain barrier down. When animals are under stress the HPA axis causes mast cells to degranulate, flooding the body with adrenalin and cortisol. The cortisol makes us dramtially more sensitive to the environment. The lipophilicity of cortisol allows for easy access across the blood-brain barrier.",

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said.\n\n&gt;But he warned the decision to remove the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed.\n\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.",

Despite that, the original guidance was often repeated even though it was not accurate.\n\nThat said, I don't mind it quite as much from a pragmatic point of view. People can be gross and if it means a few more people wash their hands, it'll cut down on the spread of other things that actually do spread via contact on surfaces.",

Lost all of my memory and now have minor brain damage. Just now, about 60% of who and what I was before. Learning to walk, talk, move my arms and remember who I was and who my loved ones were was tough. Lots of nerve damage to my left arm and hand and scaring due to fluid retention, doubt I will get full usage again. Walking is still tough, the covid dry cough fits still happen a few times a week.\n\nThe hospital I was at called me Mr. Miracle, no one in my age group 45 M, had left the hospital alive in 2 years when they had covid as bad or almost as bad as I did.\n\nI would not wish this on anyone, even people I just can not stand. It sucked and having to learn of my grandma, uncle and mom passing a year and 2 prior again all over, that was tough. When I could think sort of clear and remembered who my wife was, I was in isolation so everyone had to wear protective gear so she looked like a nurse to me, I wanted to call my mom and grandma to tell them I was ok.... that was devastating. \n\nCOVID 19 is no joke and if you get it bad, it wrecks you. Long COVID is a thing, it keeps you wrecked. Every day is a struggle, each step a challenge. \n\nHug your loved ones, text them or call, it might be the last time you talk to them and they you.",

My wife's mom permanently lost her taste and smell (3 years with no improvement), her aunt has had life-altering fatigue and brain fog going on 2 years now, and I've heard at least a dozen stories from acquaintances about significant lingering symptoms.\n\nMy uncle has lupus and due to the extreme treatments he needs, his immune system is basically gone. He'll be masking in public indefinitely. I will too, not because I'm at elevated risk, but because I've seen what COVID can do, how unpredictable its effects can be, and I don't want to get it. I'd likely be just fine if I did, but masking isn't a big deal to me so it's a reasonable precaution for me.\n\nI get annoyed when people ask this question. It's often framed as good-faith curiosity, and maybe it is, but everyone's situation is different and everyone has different levels of tolerance for risk. Maybe just accept that others' personal health decisions are none of your business?",

Unless you're immunocompromised, the CDC doesn't recommend it...\n\nIs that so?\n\n&gt;[Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions - CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccinations.htm)\n\nOops.\n\nIn reality, [50% of Americans get flu shots each year](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-2022estimates.htm), which to my surprise is significantly higher than the [40% or so that do in my native Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage/seasonal-influenza-survey-results-2021-2022.html) (though the age ranges under comparison don't line up completely). Didn't expect that, given that the US is the modern home of Wakefield's child-murdering vaccine patent scam.\n\n&gt;I feel like, there's a strong chance you're probably just saying you take boosters yearly to make me look uneducated, or cynical.\n\nI feel like I don't need to put particular effort into that aim, considering I've already proven you were uneducated on this matter.\n\n&gt;And you're just lying.\n\nWhen your world view is founded in reason and evidence, and not in the surety of your ego, you have no need of falsehood.\n\n&gt;Not going off of \"online grifters\".\n\nYou're literally a poster on /r/conspiracy *and* /r/conspiracy_commons\n\n&gt;I'm a pretty dang healthy person, I used to do caregiving, taking care of 9 dementia residents at the same time, and I never got sick for five years straight. Then when I took the regular flu booster, I got very sick, to the point I felt like I was dying. Everything I have gone off has been through patience, common sense, and experience and it hasn't let me down.\n\nAh yes, the best form of evidence - personal anecdote! Everyone knows that's far superior to research.\n\nSo you had a vaccine reaction, and because you're very educated and definitely know what you're talking about, you didn't recognise it as a vaccine reaction and decided that vaccinations make you unhealthy. Assuming any of this actually happened, of course.\n\n&gt;The people that lie to us, even segregate and threaten us, have pushed information that has a stamp from the WHO. The WHO told us if we were healthy, then we didn't need to wear masks. Then they turned around and told us we had to. I mean, if you're informed, the contradictions don't stop there.\n\n\"I don't listen to online bullshit, now let me dogwhistle the latest version of the Illuminati conspiracy that DEFINITELY doesn't have anything to do with Jews, I swear!\"\n\n&gt;If you're healthy, then you shouldn't need the booster. Which is what doctors (the ones who aren't trying to peddle money) will say as well.\n\nAh yes, the \"only people who already agree with me are valid sources\" method of scientific reasoning.\n\nI assume the legions of scientific researchers who've studied the pandemic are also all paid off by \"them\"?\n\nSorry dude, vaccines work. If we're doing anecdotes-as-evidence, I've had two vaccinations and two boosters so far, no ill effects whatsoever. Didn't even feel the first three. Everyone I know has had basically the same, we're all doing great. The mass vaccination rollout in my province was immediately followed by a massive and sustained drop in case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths. There's no real \"nuh-uh\"ing that.",

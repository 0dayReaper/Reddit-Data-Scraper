I'd pay attention and participate in class; but never handed in homework or projects. Almost all my teachers at some point pulled me aside and basically gave me the same proposition 'Well you're not dumb like some of these other kids; I just need something to work with so we don't have to fail you'. And my response to all of them was \"Alright, what do I gotta do for a D-?\" \ud83e\udd23       \nMan looking back do I really do appreciate those teachers. I remember my physics teachers saying to me \"You're not a kid holding back would do anything for. You're a kid who needs to be passed through so they can get on and do whatever you need to do with their life\".      \nSo while I got the same treatment for entirely different reasons; I totally get how this could be a problem if systematically people who actually aren't capable of shit like reading comprehension beyond a 5th grade level are being passed thru purely for metrics that make the school look good... Mind you that same school that passed me thru also inflated college admission rates so again; *these things happen more commonly than you'd think*",

I thought regardless; you hadda do the work even with the world seemingly coming down on you or it wasn't fair to the other kids who did.     \nBut again I wasn't asking for an A. I told them all I didn't deserve their understanding or kindness and that I just wanted a D- to pass. Almost all of them offered me full or substantial credit on the assignments that I could've gotten higher marks; but again I felt like I got a free pass other students didn't and I should be grateful for that much. And again in my case; I actually understood the work and participated in class which is what made them confront me. I just was too mentally drained from everything going on at the time. From an abusive ex gf blackmailing me, to my grandma dying, my close friend getting shot/killed, and having to euthanize my dog all in a matter of months of each other; they were BUGGIN thinking I was going home to do homework lol.",

It's really ridiculous. Then, when you start teaching, everyone (teachers and school admin) knows you weren't taught how to teach reading, so every year the district comes out with a \"new\" reading program. Usually one designed to sell lots of materials and books to make money for the authors. Most of these reading programs are phonics based, because that's what actually works, but some use \"whole language\" which is based on memorization and context clues. Teachers are told to use the new program and then they change it again 1-5 years later when the newest, best thing comes out.",

It\u2019s chilling what we\u2019ve done for the past 30-40 years in the US. Mississippi is one of the states that moved to science-based reading instruction. We\u2019ve used something called \u201cbalanced literacy\u201d for many years now, and it\u2019s basically just \u201cguess if you don\u2019t know the word.\u201d-not expressly teaching kids how to decode words. Only 40% of students can successfully learn to read that way. I was amazed to hear that, while speaking/listening are skills that almost all humans have the natural ability to acquire, reading is so new to our species, there is no natural ability to do so. Reading and writing have to be learned. And Mississippi is doing it in a systematic, science-backed way. Good for them!",

It's more than McDonalds pays, and their kids get 50% off and don't have to ever hear about evolution or the gays.  So win/win.  Plus, since they're operating on church property, the \"cost\" isn't very believable.  \"Tuition here is only $5,000...  For active church members... who tithe...  And provide a parent as a teaching assistant\"\n\nHey, does your private school have ...busses?  Those aren't exactly free.

Propaganda does not have to be from an official source, in fact its most effective when it flies under someone's radar. Ex. Meme's, Viral Tweets, etc. The digital age is spooky. \n\nFor example: it's well known that this state is suffering from education issues. It makes zero sense why *suddenly* after major education restrictions and damaging government regulation statistics would suddenly \"soar\". \nUnless, of course you wanted to sway public opinion and ensure them that the controversial decisions are indeed working.\n\nThe only thing i personally find unusual about this article in particular is that Washington Post is generally a Left Leaning biased news source. So its a bit conflicting of them to support red state ideology.",

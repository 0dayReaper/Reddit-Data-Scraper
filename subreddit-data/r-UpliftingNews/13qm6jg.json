Nobody is trying to ban books or restrict healthcare is concerned about authoritarianism, they'd only be concerned if it was authoritarianism that happened to oppose their ideology.\n\nIts very misleading that we grew up thinking anti-authoritarianism was part of the American culture, and it's a shame as children we were lead to believe that. It's not true. Every authoritarian we oppose is due not to their authoritarianism but because of their ideology. We oppose nazism because Americans as a whole, including conservatives, are not concerned by the existence of jews and don't see their extermination as beneficial. The nazis opposed us on ideological and economic grounds and thus became our enemy. We oppose communism because of their ideological opposition to capitalism and individualism, not because of their authoritarianism; Saudi Arabia is a close ally for example, which is a theocratic monarchy (can't get more authoritarian than that). Israel is one of our closest allies and we have heavily supported and funded them for decades, even as they have demonstrated very explicit attempts at ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of Palestinians (who are under the authority of the Israeli government but do not have legal rights). \n\nAnd of course America has always been extremely authoritarian, especially when it comes to foreign interventions (coups, assasinations, election rigging, wars, etc) that virtually everyone, Democrat and republican, have been supporting for decades. We never had a problem with authoritarianism, that was just a lie we told so we can mislead entire generations about what authoritarianism actually looks like",

(This is true some places)\n\nWhat if we said that people with depression or other acute mental health concerns weren't allowed to access psychiatric help, or counselling or therapy etc. because of the taboo? Then there would inevitably be advocates who would speak to the point of: 'people who suffer because of these differences in how their brains are wired compared to what is expected of them from society at large, have a much higher rate of suicide. We can greatly reduce this risk by allowing them to access care that can help them cope, come to terms with, accept, or try to make changes in what is causing them such distress.'\n\nThat seems like a fairly comparable situation to me. Is it as flatly simple as  \"do this or kids will kill themselves\"? Of course not. But when the observation from professionals is \"when we do 'X', people suffering from 'Y' are less likely to die from 'Z'\", and 'Z' represents kids, family members and friends literally killing themselves because of this issue, then is it any wonder people become emotional about it?",

I'll get around to reading it when my own kid starts school and judge for myself. I don't have to read it to not believe you about it, I've seen nothing but conservatives argue in bad faith so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Even if this one book is inappropriate and is elementary schools, doesn't mean we need to start a review board..lemme guess, conservative members would be in charge of it? No thanks, you're group has damaged this country enough. I'm done here lol \u270c\ufe0f",

The parents have spoken in thousands of school districts that this shit is not okay.  You guys are happy you get to keep grooming in one district.  That scares the shit out of me that grooming is considered uplifting news.",

Nah, go to church and you find where that shit really go's on at. Your projection is hilarious but yeah, keep saying it's lgbt+ community and not the religious right. Yes 1 out of 1000 but we'll keep fighting your flavor of fascism, your group has nothing but threats, cheating, and lies, and one day you'll see just how in the minority your views really are. Look at the average age of the right, they'll be dead in the next 30 years, if that. So enjoy the havoc you are inflicting now, we'll in time reverse the damage.",

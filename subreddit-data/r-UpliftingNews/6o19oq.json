Along the way he gets shipwrecked off Easter Island, surfs the longest wave of his life \u2014 and prepares himself for a rare ascent of Cerro Corcovado. Jeff's life turns when he meets up in a rainy hut with Chouinard and Tompkins who, once driven purely by a love of climbing and surfing, now value above all the experience of raw nature \u2014 and have come to Patagonia to spend their fortunes to protect it.",

The companies that actually manufacture quality have less of an incentive to as well if they want to make the most profits. Consumerism has its benefits of course (it probably drove up the quality of life one way or another) but definitely has consequences as well.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to buy cheap trashy stuff I never wore again.

Ultimately, this attitude is wasteful and reflective of our obsession with having meaningless, new and shiny things at the expense of our environment. \n\nHold onto your stuff people!

They are doing so many things right. 90% of their textiles are recycled or Bluesign approved and they are literally inventing new manufacturing methods to minimize their own environmental impact, while still donating a portion of their revenue every year to grassroots environmental organizations. Last year they donated 100% of their Black Friday sales to small grassroots environmental groups around the country, even though they had 5 times more revenue than they had anticipated.\n\nThey are providing people with living wage jobs, providing consumers with sustainable, responsible goods that are made to last, and donating literally millions of dollars to environmental protection every year.\n\nThey will repair or replace ANYTHING with their logo on it for free. I bought my girlfriend a really nice down vest for Christmas last year; it got ripped badly during a long hike, and they had it completely repaired and back to us within 3 weeks.\n\nThey also recently started a program called [worn wear](https://wornwear.patagonia.com/) to get rid of unsold merchandise, and re-sell gear that people returned under their \"100% satisfaction guarantee\". They basically wash everything and sell it for 80% off. I paid $39 for a ~$200 down jacket that someone returned, and it came with a mint in the pocket. lol\n\nThey truly care about preserving the planet, and they really put their money where their mouth is.",

When he first moved to Chile and started buying considerable stretches of land, the authorities pushed back with several would-be-frictions, which luckily were completely unconstitutional\u2014so \"can't stop me\". Dick move on our side, sorry about that.\n\n3. After he died his wife made *the* ballsiest move\u2014it probably was something ongoing, though\u2014and gave away these huge stretches of land, which *no* government could refuse to take and jump into this protective project without looking stupid. She forced us to commit with the preservation of our lands for future generations. Hats off to the Tompkins.\n\nThis is an incredible investment that will most definitely pay off. Not now, not in 10 years, but maybe in 20 or 30. I think I speak for most of us Chileans when I say: thank you.",

Also they were just recovering from bankruptcy so the dollar went pretty far at times. ",

The VLT is there and is open for tours but you need to plan them months in advance and is very far north. Start setting up flight alerts using various websites like kayak or momondo. Even if you don't know when you want to go you can use flight alerts to get a feel for prices during different times of the year. Chile is was long as the USA is wide roughly so keep that in mind when you're looking at a map and places to go. I wasn't a fan of Santiago so I'd go either to the coast or down south (telescopes are in the desert up north) and go see places like Puc\u00f3n. If you have some questions I can hopefully answer some I lived there for almost a year and it's a neat place! Highly recommend but if you want to go just start roughly planning now and things will start to fall into place.",

Have that said, the biggest current mining interests are in copper and lithium wich are exclusive from the north region in the desert, far away from the forests and where the majority of the wildlife exists. That doesnt mean that i forget about the desert fauna, but we have so much desert that the mining industry barely makes a dent in that. In short, the mining industry in chile occurs in infertile areas, but the waste on the mining industry is a topic that is very regulated in Chile and all of the mining industries must have a waste treatment plant.",

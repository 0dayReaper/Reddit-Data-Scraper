These dogs, they seem just so healthy and vibrant, and not at all like humans have to artificially inseminate them and help breed the next generation of tiny, tiny, tiny animals.\n\nHeavy, heavy, heavy sarcasm here.\n\nBreeding these dogs the way that they HAVE to be bred to enable this kind of genetics starts to cross the line into animal cruelty.",

I am not trying to excuse anything, all I'm saying is we have been mutating and deforming dog breeds for quite a while, and IMO we have crossed the border of ridiculousness a long time ago, way before teacup breeds were introduced. That doesn't mean to say that I think all breeds have gone too far, there are plenty of great breads and mixes of dogs.\n\nBottom line, my point was that we crossed the line of cruelty with some breads a long time ago. Breeds like pugs, and German shepherds (until recently) are just two breeds that come to mind.",

I know they were a very popular breed in the very late 1960s and early 1970s (anecdotally, based on my personal observation growing up on Long Island, NY). Then I started seeing them again in the 2010s, but they looked different.",

If you compare show breed to working breed GSD from the 80-90-and early 2000 you will see a huge difference in posture. Esthetics aside, the main problem with that is that pretty much all show breed GSD suffered from hip dysplasia and most of them developed difficulty with walking at an early age.\n\nEdit: An interesting presentation on how the GSD show breed has changed over the years, you can clearly see how the dogs frame was completely changed and mutated to accommodate for the slanted back fashion. \n\n[Past to present in the German Shepherds](https://www.royalair.org/pasttopresent.htm)",

You can't \"breed out\" the unhealthy traits of those kinds of dogs because those unhealthy traits ARE the dog, right?\n\nThat was my point, but I agree we crossed the threshold of cruelty a long time ago.

I don't remember those from the GSDs I saw in the 1960s-70s on Long Island. Then I started noticing them in the 2010s. \n\nGSDs were great dogs when I was a kid. Beautiful, playful, affectionate, and intelligent. They were suspicious and scary at first when I went into friends' homes, but as soon as they saw their human family being friendly to me, why, I was family too.\n\nLater I learned that they just absorb the way they're raised. Raise the GSD to be vicious and hostile, and that's how it'll turn out. Raise it to be playful, affectionate, and intelligent, and that's the kind of dog you'll get. True for all dogs, but particularly so for GSDs.",

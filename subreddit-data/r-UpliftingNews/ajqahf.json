There's a guy in his early 30s there who's had multiple shoulder surgeries - the odds of re-injuring it after a surgery are exponentially higher. Each time he has less range of motion and it takes him nearly a year to recover to the point that he can work out even a little bit. There's another guy in his mid-50s there who tore his rotator cuff about 3 years ago and got the stem cell treatment. He was back working out (in a limited capacity) in about 2 months and fully recovered in under 6 months, and that shoulder is his *good* shoulder now.",

I hope other people don\u2019t have to go through the painful realization that they\u2019ll never regain full function of their injured part (however minor).",

With that said, scarring of neural tissue is one of the reasons that these types of lifelong injuries persist, because the scar tissue (which never goes away) blocks signal pathways. I would imagine that removing the scar tissue, and in the process likely re-injuring the original tissue, could indeed be potentially treated with stem cells. Again, I don\u2019t know enough about this to know if it\u2019s possible, but it seems logical to me. ",

In the final stage of denervation atrophy, most of the muscle fibers are destroyed and replaced by fibrous and fatty tissue. The fibers that do remain are composed of a long cell membrane with a lineup of muscle cell nuclei but with few or no contractile properties and little or no capability of regenerating myofibrils if a nerve does regrow. That fibrous tissue tends to continue shortening, which is called contracture and can be debilitating and disfiguring, which is why daily stretching is required during the atrophying process.\n\nSo, to summarize, even if we manage to find a way to repair spinal chord injuries, if the injury occured more than 1-2 years prior to therapy the therapy won't have much effect, unless we also find a way to reverse muscle cell metaplasia into fibrous and fat tissue.\n\nSource: 6th year med student in Europe, doctor in a year",

People who knew him said that it worked at first, but the tests continued to become more and more experimental and dangerous. Reeve didn\u2019t care, and he desperately tried to find anything that worked.

It's pretty awesome. For my mom they would literally harvest her stem cells, give her a shit ton of chemo to completely destroy her immune system, and then put the harvested cells back in. The harvested cells then recognize there's a lack of an immune system, and they become a new immune system. (That's a pretty simplified version of it at least).\n\nIt's amazing. Mom's disease is autoimmune, so the immune system attacks her nerves. So by destroying and replacing her immune system, the disease should be gone.",

They get cues from their environment telling them what kind of specialization they should start to develop. Then, they divide into a new, and hopefully healthy, tissue.\n\nI've even heard they're even experimenting with growing a 'donor organ' from your own stem cells. They'd take something like a pig's heart, then remove all cells, leaving only the scaffolding for cells behind. Then, they'd extract some stem cells from you and inject them in the scaffolding. Your own cells would then grow into a functional heart that can replace your faulty heart. Since it's made from your own cells, the 'donor' organ won't be rejected. (I'll see if I can find a video on the subject) \n\nOf course, reality isn't as beautiful as theory. It's more complicated and nuanced than what I'm telling. The world of microbiology really is a magical place though.\n\nSource: am a microbiology student. I l\n\nEdit: found a video: https://youtu.be/j9hEFUpTVPA",

We have treatments and medical equipment that are incredibly helpful for many illnesses and disabilities, but no one can afford them. Even insulin has become so cost prohibitive that diabetics are [dying](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/money/5394266/insulin-price-increase-rationing). As a disabled and chronically ill person currently fighting insurance for necessary medical equipment, it\u2019s important to remember that. New technology is incredibly exciting and uplifting, but it\u2019s often more inspiring to able bodied people reading about it than to the people it\u2019s meant to help. Many disabled folks are not able to work or work as much is needed to support themselves, or are working but can\u2019t afford medical costs. I\u2019m 21, too disabled to work any job I\u2019m qualified for, and I have $500-$600 in co-pays for meds and doctor\u2019s appts every month. If I didn\u2019t have insurance, I\u2019d be screwed. Even with insurance, I\u2019ve had to resort to sex work to pay rent in the past. I know quite a few people close to my age who are ill or disabled and experiencing the same thing.\n\n @ Able bodied people reading this, small acts of advocacy can also go a long way! Look into policies around disability at your workplace. Pay attention when you\u2019re walking around\u2014 how many places do you go regularly that aren\u2019t wheelchair accessible? Hint: it\u2019s probably a lot. Look into programs to help homeless disabled people, if you have the funds to contribute (disabled folks are disproportionately affected by homelessness). Supporting new tech is great, but the trickle-down healthcare aspect is useless for most of us. If you have the time/energy/means, do what you can to help disabled people succeed in a system that doesn\u2019t really care about us! It means a lot. ",

It took me 3 months of intensive physical therapy almost everyday in order for me to walk with a walker/use a wheelchair. It took me more to eventually be able to walk on my own, although quite wobbly. \n\nMy whole body is still far weaker then before, my legs feel like they\u2019ll fold after walking around for just a few minutes. My right hand works but might forever be only able to open to the claw position. After writing or gaming for a while my hand just starts to burn up. My sense of temperature got messed up so now my lower body feels things hotter compared to my upper body. \n\nThis is all after 1 emergency surgery, therapy, another surgery to install ladder-shaped rods in my neck for support, more therapy, and a cyber knife procedure. \n\nOver 5 years of doctors appointments.\n\nSo if Kris can use a wheelchair in 3 weeks vs my 3 months - it really does give me hope.",

He owns his own printing company, so that wasn\u2019t working for him at all. After 2 treatments, he is SO much better!! He can stand for hours, exercise like he used to, and no more pain! He had to pay out of pocket, but it was definitely worth it!\n\nEdit: wow, this blew up! Let me talk to my Dad and find out more info and I will post it here ASAP! \n\nEdit 2: Okay, I talked to my Dad and here\u2019s all the info! My Dad lives in California (USA). He had his treatment done five years ago by Dr. Jason Miller, who he met through Regenx(?), but who now has his own company specializing in stem cell work. He had two sessions total, six weeks apart, that total to $4000 out of pocket. His diagnosis was a deteriorating disc in his back from an old injury. He said the largest hospital is in La Jolla under the name GioStar. He said they take your blood and process it and then basically re-inject you, he said it\u2019s not too painful although the first one was worse than the second. He told me his brother-in-law also had stem cell work done on his knees and wrists, but he went to a different doctor as they specialize in different areas of the body. I hope this helps!",

She was diagnosed with scoliosis as a child and had a metal rod surgically placed to fuse with her spine. So all these years shes been in discomfort and pain. She has always gone to the gym regularly since I have been alive, and has been always health conscious. She stretches for 1-3 hours almost daily, just to feel slight relief.\n\nSo far my mom says she has increased energy. I was curious at what intervals your father saw benefits? Right away, 3-6 months after treatment?\n\nEdit: her treatment was done in Panama, the same center that Mel Gibson took his father for treatment, mentioned on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast.\n\nIt was the Dr from episode #1066 - Dr. Neil Riordan\n\n*video link - https://youtu.be/OtL1fEEtLaA\n\n*clinic website - www.rmiclinic.com",

            "comment": "For those of you saying \"fund this!\", I can assure you that there's a TON of stem cell research and clinical trials going on. They're not a magic bullet yet, but some research is very promising. I can give you an example from my own experience:  five years ago my wife suffered a stroke (at age 43), leaving her with very limited mobility on one side, along with some cognitive deficiencies. A little over a year ago she was accepted into phase 2 of a clinical trial, where genetically modified stem cells were injected directly into the brains of patients who were several years post-stroke (brains were imaged in great detail and injections were made around the area of damage). No results are available yet from this phase, but in the very small phase 1 of the study several patients had dramatic improvement (one was able to raise her arm above her head the next day, when before treatment she could barely move it at all). That being said, some patients in the first phase had minimal to no improvement, and my wife has not had any response from her treatment, which was over a year ago now.  From what I've been able to learn about clinical trials in this time, if the treatment in this story (which I believe is from 2016) had this dramatic result for a statistically significant number of participants, it would have been fast tracked and been more widely available by now.  There's a lot of money to be made in this, since pharma companies will be developing the lines of stem cells that will be used, so once something is proven safe and effective you can bet that it will be made available.  My wife's study was pharma (not government)  funded, although the study PIs are university based. As for our own situation, we're now anxiously waiting for word  on what study group my wife was in - there were two different dosages of stem cells, and one control group (the control group got a \"sham surgery\" - they really drilled into the skull, but not all the way, and then just pretended to inject the cells). 52 patients in each group. If she was in the placebo group, as we suspect, then she could potentially be eligible for Phase 3 of the study, where they will be evaluating different dosages of the cells and all patients will really receive the treatment.",

My gut feeling is they have the potential to help, but significant rehab will still be required by the patient. If new neurons replace dead/damaged ones, it's likely they will essentially be blank slates. Any complex behaviours affected will probably still have to be relearned. But having functioning neurons certainly could help with that enormously.\n\nIn short, who the fuck knows. But I wish you and your wife the best.",

My boss (smartest human I\u2019ve ever met) loves to talk about the acceleration of technology and how using Moore\u2019s Law for every technology sector is a really good basis. \n\nFor those that don\u2019t know, Moore\u2019s law (when applied to its original field) is that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years. Effectively meaning that processing power doubles every two years. (This has slowed down recently but again this is just a generalization). \n\nApplying that to all technology and specially cost, imagine this treatment costs $100,000 (just a made up number that helps keep numbers easy to understand). Now if technology doubles (costs halve) every two years, that means every 5 cycles or 10 years we get a ten-fold improvement also known as an order of magnitude.\n\nSo applying that to our example, in just 10 years that same treatment will now be $10,000. Still very expensive but much more manageable. Then think another 10 years. Now we\u2019re at $1,000. Almost everyone will experience a $1,000 medical issue in their life. Now another 10 years, it\u2019s $100 and you don\u2019t even bat an eye.\n\nSo in 30 years you went from one-of-a-kind groundbreaking procedure to a completely normal operation that people could go to their doctors office for an hour check up and get.\n\nOf course this is all theoretical and won\u2019t apply to some areas of technology and stuff but I think it\u2019s a pretty good approximate for how things are going.\n\nThe whole point is just imagine what things will be like in 50 years or 5 orders of magnitude different then where we are now. In the above example that same treatment that once was $100,000 is now $1.\n\nI think it\u2019s very real possibility that we get to a point where most big name diseases, cancers, and other maladies simply just no longer exist.",

It states that this is basically a press release for a company trying to woo investors, and that the procedure is only applicable to very small subset of paralyzed people (those injured within 2-6 weeks of the procedure).   Still promising imo, but may not be the cure all that a lot of people are hoping for. ",

I've only had sex after my injury so I don't know what busting a nut feels like, I assume good.  Thats why my favorite feeling that I miss is taking a shit. Followed by kicking a soccer ball. Maybe someday, eh? :-)",

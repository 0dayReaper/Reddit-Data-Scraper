Tree planting, called 'afforestation,' can play a role in a comprehensive climate policy.\n\nUnfortunately, media coverage of one [study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76) last summer has left people with the impression that tree planting can be a silver bullet in solving climate change.\n\nAfforestation has the potential to remove up to between 1-10% of cumulative anthropogenic carbon emissions (source: [Climate Interactive - an MIT project](https://www.climateinteractive.org/analysis/what-role-can-afforestation-play-in-addressing-climate-change/)).  That best case scenario described above is if we plant enough new forest to fill 0.9 billion hectares, an area equal to the entire United States.\n\nPlanting trees is very helpful for many reasons, but in regards to climate change we also  need to pass other policies to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.\n\nEdit:  For those asking for effective ways to act on climate change, NASA climatologist [Dr James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen) says that becoming an active volunteer with [this group](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-Climate&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Climate) is [the most impactful thing an individual can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8).

Yes, you are right, planting trees will not solve the rise of temperature problem, but it helps with humidity, with biome conservation, soil preservation, it lessen erosion, thus contributing to the health of rivers that are water sources in many places. Not to mention the effect of nature in human mental health, something that has been research in the last years. Overall I would say that a greener world is a better world and we all should start planting trees. :)",

In fact, Iowa use to have wildfires like California that helped prevent invasive tree growth in the state and replenish the planets that were around as a Tallgrass Prairie is a fire-dependent ecosystem. That is why many do a prescribed burns of the prairie grass that does exist. Today, less the 0.1% of the original Tall Grass Prairie exists in Iowa and overall covered 14 states.

Considered by many to be one of the most successful of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programs, the CCC planted more than three billion trees and constructed trails and shelters in more than 800 parks nationwide during its nine years of existence. The CCC helped to shape the modern national and state park systems we enjoy today.\n\nhttps://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/civilian-conservation-corps\n\nMany of the participants had their monthly payment sent back home to their families, which greatly aided both the family and the economy. The family was now able to buy necessities, and consumer demand, which was at a low during the depression, was lifted, helping business recover. Additional work done to help improve soil quality, etc, acted as investment into our nations producers\n\nPBS American Experience has [a fantastic freely available documentary on the program for anyone interested in learning more](https://vimeo.com/150192017).",

The same way back in the early 1900\u2019s the US and German governments had massive programs that employed people to build the highway systems. It was a critical development that was going to have to get done at some point The desperation of all the citizens meant there was a flood of workers who were willing to commit to the project for relatively cheap in the governments eyes, yet in their eyes it was life saving money. Major countries need to take note and read a history book if they ever want a chance to come out better on the other side of this.",

Trees that are planted too close together have the potential to choke one another out. Animals may eat them. Fungi may take over. People may plant them incorrectly. Depending on monitoring rates, and whether or not the trees are even planted properly 50-80% of the trees could survive. I'm basing that wildly unhelpful range based on looking into the survival rate of trees planted in Canada, which varied quite a bit from forestry company to forestry company. \npotential land could include:\n\n\n\n-increasing urban trees - beside roadways, in downtown areas, etc. Think of LA, in every picture you see of the city you also see many palm trees.\n\n-pre-forested areas damaged by destruction - areas hit by forest fires and bug infestations could do with some new trees. \n\n-areas that have experienced desertification - anywhere all the trees where cut down and just never replaced, now's the time to replace them.\n\n\n\nSomeone may have a better, more correct answer than me, but you're definitely right, no matter what quite alot of space is needed!!",

As the son of dirt farmers on both sides of my family going back at least 3 generations I distinctly remember the application fee playing a significant factor in the number of schools I applied at (three, I applied to three colleges).",

Despite his multitude of options, Barnes said he always knew he wanted to attend Cornell, and choosing another school \"was never really an option.\"\n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-school-student-dennis-maliq-barnes-new-orleans-received-10-million-scholarships-cornell-university/",

Worked cutting lawns when I was 13 to 16. Restored my mustang in my garage that I bought for $700 with my lawn mower money, cuz my parents couldn't buy me a car. Got a job, paid my insurance and fuel myself.\n\nI couldn't get a grant or scholarship of any kind back in 1993 as a white male. If I had been female or any other color like my friends who did less than I, I could have easily got one then. My parents combined mad $60K a year, but had a new born, my half brother and had to focus on him, which was fine.\n\nAfter a a car accident that left me paralyzed, I worked with the state occupational therapy department, did a series of tests over a week, tested a 144 IQ, and was able to get a pell grant and my state would help pay for college.",

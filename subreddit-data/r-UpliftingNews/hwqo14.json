There are an awful lot of WWI and WWII soldiers who could do with more recognition.   How about Ft. Davis, after Benjamin O. Davis, the first African-American general?  Or Ft. Rose, after Maurice Rose, the only general to die in action in WWII?\n\nEDIT: Apparently there were other generals who were KIA in WWII.  Wikipedia says that Rose was the only one killed in the European Theater.",

Nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two World Wars. Go to that community where Fort Bragg is, in a great state. I love that state. Go to the community. Say, 'How do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg?' And then, what are we gonna name it? You're gonna name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton? What are you gonna name it, Chris? Tell me what you're gonna name it? So, there's a whole thing here. We won two World Wars. Two World Wars. Beautiful World Wars that were vicious and horrible, and we won them out of Fort Bragg. We won out it of all of these forts that now they want to throw those names away, and no, I'm against that, and you know what, most other people are, and I even. I don't believe in polls because I see the fakest polls I've ever seen, but, that poll is a 64 percent thing, which actually surprised me. We won World Wars out of these, out of these military bases. No, I'm not gonna go changing them. I'm not gonna go changing them. I'm not gonna go changing them.\"",

Say, 'How do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg?' And then, what are we gonna name it? You're gonna name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton? What are you gonna name it, Chris? Tell me what you're gonna name it? So, there's a whole thing here. We won two World Wars. Two World Wars. Beautiful World Wars that were vicious and horrible, and we won them out of Fort Bragg. We won out it of all of these forts that now they want to throw those names away, and no, I'm against that, and you know what, most other people are, and I even. I don't believe in polls because I see the fakest polls I've ever seen, but, that poll is a 64 percent thing, which actually surprised me. We won World Wars out of these, out of these military bases.

Meanwhile, active duty or retired vets go en masse and get paid anywhere from 1-100% additional salary with no scrutiny and we send trillions to defence contractors and weapons manufacturers to help us continue to *checks notes* kill little brown babies and their families in the Middle East and elsewhere so wE cAn hAz resources.",

            "comment": "Fucking hell! This is even in the uplifting news sub. \n\nThis should be proof that all that matters to redditors is the headline. This is part of the defense budget. It's a 741 BILLION DOLLAR Budget for 2021. It includes, \"Senators allocated $9.1 billion in the bill to buy 91 Lockheed Martin-built F-35 fighters, *14 more than requested by the Pentagon.*\" It's veto proof because the democrats and republicans alike all want as much money as possible for the war machine. \n\n\nThis is how you get reddit to jump for joy for a defense budget that in normal years they would oppose with every fiber of their being.",

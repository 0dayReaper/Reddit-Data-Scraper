Shame on the headteacher, they're supposed to support these kinds of actions, not stint them.",

Teenagers wouldn't have much reason to look at world events beyond what's reported on the news, but now they can learn about entire revolutions taking place just by checking their Facebook feed. They're able to actually research stuff instead of having to blindly trust whatever adults tell them.\n\nIt's amazing how much the internet is shaping this generation. I don't think some people in the older generations realize just how powerful it really is.",

It makes me very hopeful.\n\nThe way I see it, we grew up assuming everything was fine, then we realised as adults that the world was fucked, so we're disillusioned and unhappy but we became idle. But the next generation are growing up knowing exactly how fucked the world is and just how fucked their prospects are, so they haven't had the chance to grow complacent. But of course we should never resign ourselves to being idle and assume the next generation will clear up after our mess - that's exactly how so many issues today came about.",

Spat on, strangled unconscious and beat. All in front of the bus driver, people on the bus from work. They did fuck all. Teachers had no way to enforce shit. I got told to hit back but I was to scared of the consequences at the time so I never did as a result I endured 5 years of hell which only got worse each time I did report it to teachers / principle. \n\nFast forward 10 years, I was an assistant instructor and in my group had a girl going through exactly the same. I told her she's learning martial arts for a reason use it. She did. She defended herself against 4 of them on the train. Within a week she was a completely different girl, happy, confident and had 0 bully issues for the rest of her school life. \n\nSitting down and talking to bullies (Real bullies) is completely pointless. I have 0 sympathy to any little scumbag who going through shit and at home then takes it out on someone weaker than them. Less so for the ones who just think it's \"funny\"",

Do you see any of them behaving the way you are right now? You are disturbing all these people with your behaviour and it\u2019s *not* fair that they have to listen to you behave this way.\u201d\n\nShe said that **once** and from that point on she never had a problem again, other than one single day when I think I was just tired and grumpy and throwing a strop in a clothing store.\n\n\u201cI love you and I don\u2019t want to but if you continue behaving this way, I will wallop your backside in front of *all these people* watching. Think of how embarrassed you\u2019ll be - now, we can do that, or you can let me get this quietly and we can leave in a few minutes. Which do you prefer we do?\u201d She said it loudly enough so that a few people around me looked at me wide-eyed, and that was all it took for me to apologise and continue on our way quietly. \n\nI guess I appreciated the forewarning and could see that yes, that\u2019s exactly what would\u2019ve happened. But I do also understand that what works with me wouldn\u2019t always work with every child because I wasn\u2019t unfortunate enough to suffer behavioural or developmental difficulties. Some children would require a different approach I\u2019m sure.\n\nI see so many parents now with screaming children who are either being completely ignored while they scream, or are verbally assaulted with a barrage of \u201cSTFU YOU LITTLE BASTARD OR I SWEAR I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU\u201d all while they\u2019ve grabbed the child by their arm and are violently jerking them around. It just breaks my heart. The children have no respect for the people around them or for the consequences of their actions, all because they\u2019re either ignored or being constantly mistreated and abused by parents with explosive tempers. \n\nIt\u2019s almost rare now to find parenting that comes from love and compassion!! When I see something like a father taking his little girl out and she\u2019s happily chatting away and just following his lead, it genuinely shocks me when to see well-adjusted children behaving maturely, and that shouldn\u2019t be shocking - it should be commonplace.",

The data is showing were heading towards massive weather uncertainty, the photos confirm the warming effects previously predicted, you've seen first hand how much more flippant the weather is getting. \n\nWe need to solve this now or face further conflict over diminishing resources like farmable land, drinking water, living space, and money as markets continue to be affected! \n\nUnless you're rich enough to buy a self sufficient private island/mountain bunker and don't mind riding this whole thing out for the rest of your and your children's lives then WE ALL need to cooperate!",

I've seen enough adults don't pick up their own trash; there just aren't enough positive role models to go around sometimes.\n\nGo easy on the kids.",

The culprits were two rather rotund children who came from homes where their parents had either a gambling or alcohol addiction. I also understand that there was some form of domestic abuse involved. So they chose me, unfortunately, because I came from a good family.\n\nFuck Australian country towns, man. The kids there don\u2019t stand a fucking chance.",

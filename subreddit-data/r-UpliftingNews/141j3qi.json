It hit its highest peak last year - I'm not sure of any more recent polls. https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/maltlf4olewbwdr4w-nkvg.png\n\nBut just remember that we're not going backwards on this, even just to 2015. Still vote, still talk to your elderlies in a way that they can hear that might soften them up, but there's more than enough reason for hope and unity.",

These are all rules that affect public school, universities, and government-funded institutions. Yes, this is where they\u2019re creating new laws to discriminate, and then some you linked to prevent discrimination. My position is that the government has a duty to pass laws to protect the rights of trans citizens, and actively fight legislation that would harm them and their rights.",

My family still lives in my hometown.\n\n\nUtahns are very friendly and conflict-averse so they will make you feel warm and welcome which is great if you are just visiting. The rub is that the culture is also very passive-aggressive and gossipy. They will smile to your face and shake your hand then talk shit behind your back and do whatever they can to hold you back socially and professionally. If you aren't Mormon you are suddenly everybody's favorite project until you make it clear that you aren't a candidate for conversion. You have to fight to find the subculture of other outcasts and misfit toys and the only place where that culture thrives in SLC. \n\n\nI moved to the Pacific Northwest 10 years ago and I don't even like to go back and visit. Everyone from my former life apart from my immediate family is so fake and judgmental and the legislative world is genuinely hostile to the existence of queer people like myself. I avoid spending any money or time in that bigoted church run state as much as possible because chances are that money is getting funneled into the hate cult of Mormonism via mandatory tithing and directly into bigoted policy at the state level that harms queer people. I do not feel safe in a state that is filled with people who overwhelming vote for legislators that are working to erase my existence regardless of how many smiles and hellos I get when I visit.",

Some people have a fairly easy birth, and recover quickly. On the other side of the spectrum people have very difficult births that sometimes result in stillbirth, or major injury (sometimes death) of the mother. Along with this, some mothers want an epidural while others pursue to have it naturally. I think stuff like this is also what it's talking about including the POC issues!",

I transitioned at 34 when I had originally found out that trans people existed when I was 13 or 14 at the latest. I just didn't fit the gatekeepy criteria at the time (and my dysphoria wasn't so severe as to cause any obvious problems) so I thought that I couldn't actually be trans as a result. So, fuck gatekeeping.\n\nI just happen to also believe that there is a biological reason as to *why* trans people are trans. (I think there is enough evidence to be persuasive on this point. We just don't know, exhaustively, what factors are at play in causing someone to be trans or not.)",

I will apply a Business Agility approach to improving our education system. This means making Education a viable, and valuable, by listening to the educators themselves.\n      \n\u200b\n       \nWe need to attract people to education as one of the best options for careers. We have the budget to do so, let's attract the same leaders we want in our businesses to our education system. Our kids deserve the best, not the cheapest.    \n      \nLIBERTY FOR ALL     \n      \nKindness is Feedback     \n     \nI firmly believe in the value of personal faith. I grew up being taught the same thing as most other people in Salt Lake City; limited government, community service, acting based on the best information we have, not on the whims of the day.\n      \n\u200b\u200b \n      \nThese values still drive me today. I will bring kindness to this conversation by creating a shared understanding of how our legislation impacts Utahn's liberty.\n     \n\u200b\n    \nFrom being able to make our own medical decisions, who we can love, and how our community builds wealth, I commit to liberty-driven principles that recognize the impact to all of Utah's communities.\n      \n\u200b\u200b\n     \nTHE ENVIRONMENT     \n      \nKindness is Accountability     \n     \nOur politicians on the Hill have regularly shown an inability to be accountable for their actions. From wasting money changing the Cannabis legislation, to ignoring the science behind pollution that drains our lakes and reduces the lung quality of our children.\n      \n\u200b\n       \nThese aren't natural consequences. They are the outcomes of policy choices. In order to hold our politicians accountable for these outcomes, we must be willing to vote for new representation.",

So no, we're not gonna fuck off. This is gonna keep happening until there's equality and if you don't like it, tough shit. It's clear YOU don't need to worry about anything because your rights aren't on the chopping block all the fucking time.\n\nOf course, I can tell I'm wasting my time because all I had to do was click on your profile and see you're woefully misinformed about transgender healthcare. Shut the fuck up. Holy shit you people are annoying.",

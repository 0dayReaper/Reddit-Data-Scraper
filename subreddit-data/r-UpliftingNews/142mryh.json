Think about how long and how much stuff we have digged out of the ground over the past hundred years and more: ideally, we should take all of that carbon back and bury it or tie it up into something that won't rot away again. That's a huge undertaking that would take a lot of energy to achieve. We are probably stuck with that extra CO2 for a long time, maybe forever.\n\nThere are other ways to cool down the planet, but those are stopgap measures, and usually really temporary: you can spray chemicals and particulates in the atmosphere to bounce back sunlight, or put gigantic parasols in space, but yeah, temporary measures.\n\nFwiw, I think it would be easiest to take plants or algae and bury them or turn them into something that won't rot or burn away. Creating new forests isn't nearly enough: they are carbon neutral after being created and won't help after that. We've burned *a lot* of fossil fuels.",

It can also be done using natural processes - for example if you chop down a tree and build with the wood instead of burning it, the CO2 stays in the wood. I think I read of another carbon capture project where they use fast growing algae to absorb CO2 and then bury it in where it can't decompose? \n\nThese methods are very small in scale though, and very expensive. But we said the same about solar cells twenty years ago so who knows - hopefully after this whole mess is over with we'll become carbon negative and things will slowly, slowly start to improve.",

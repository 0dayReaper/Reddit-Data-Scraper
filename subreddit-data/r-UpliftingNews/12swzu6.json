I don't know how they plan to scale this up to have any meaningful impact without disrupting sensitive ecosystems. \n\nCarbon capture is a gamble we cannot afford to rely on. It's great if it ends up working, but reducing our emissions is the only currently proven way to combat climate change and we should not seek excuses to further procrastinate doing that.",

If you don't these microbe will eventually degrade or be eaten and produce methane or CO2 again.\n\nTo bury it you will need a lot of work.\n\nThere is no income in doing this, only expense so... No one will do it.",

Rather than running a single cable inside and then putting the splitters in the basement. They put 4 splitters just hanging down the side of the house with no waterproofing then ran a 5 cable bundle through a giant hole in the wall into my basement. And instead of actually properly mounting the line from the telephone pole to my house with some sort of strain relief, they just attached it to Verizon's fiber with a bungee cord and left it hanging in my backyard about 7ft off the ground.",

About a week of the dogs hearing dinner clucking away on the other side of that wall, and they dug out of their side, went around, and dug into the duck enclosure to eat the ducks. I saw a duck head disappear down one of their throats.",

One of our chickens had recently hatched an illicit bunch of incest eggs- we thought she was *dead*, drug off by a fox or something but nope this bitch hid under the shed until her chicks hatched and then she led us to them. \n\nSo we put these chicks in our chick coop inside our barn. Never has a chick escaped from this giant metal tub. And immediately these little fucks take after their mother, because they're escaping at all hours of the day. We had to do hourly chick checks. \n\nWell, one day as we're going out to do the check, Zoey comes up toward the back porch, doing this dainty little jog she does. And I notice yellow feathers sticking out of her mouth. \n\n\"Zoey!\" I yelled angrily, and the change on her face was immediate- she went from calm to defensive and guilty. And then I hear it. \n\n*cheep. cheep.* \n\nThe chick is still alive in Zoey's mouth. I can see it moving. \n\nI take off towards her and she starts running- I don't think she quite understood what she did wrong, I think she thought it was one of her little stuffed toys that had a squeaker in it. \n\nI yelled her name angrily once more, and then she stopped, turned around, sat down and started panting. Her mouth was open and yellow feathers were falling out of it. \n\nShe had accidentally swallowed the chick alive. \n\n**TL;DR** my black lab was trying to help a chick and then accidentally swallowed it and it was mostly my fault. Also we named the rooster of that particular batch Houdini. ",

Pet stores don't really exist anymore due to puppy mills and social backlash, so it's breeders, kijiji or the pound.\n\nOver 6 months of checking out the 3 local animal shelters, there were a total of about 5 dogs in the system.  I have a young child, so for example, an ex-feral dog or abused dog isn't really an option many of the times in my situation, but even with that caveat, going the pound route simply didn't work for me.  I wanted to adopt and couldn't.\n\nI wasn't looking for a puppy, or a specific breed.  Simply a child appropriate dog, and over the span of several months, it never once became an option.  Perhaps its an anomaly of Toronto, but the option to adopt isn't always as simple as it sounds.\n",

Also afraid of slick floors, water, etc is common that cause a dog to be DQd. Sometimes they are even too aggressive and cannot be controlled. These types won't let go when on the bite or won't call off when sent and recalled. \n\nK9s must go through training every week and have to re certify every year and some agencies every 6 months. Dogs must show obedience, search capabilities and will bite when told to and most importantly call off when sent then told to stop. They must also let go when told to. \n\nIf a dog fails any one of these they get a second chance to re qualify that day. If they fail again they must wait a week and cannot be on the streets until they do. It's always a K9 certified trainer from another agency who does the qualifications as well. \n\nMine never didn't qualify but like anything like this is it was stressful. That call off was always the hardest. ",

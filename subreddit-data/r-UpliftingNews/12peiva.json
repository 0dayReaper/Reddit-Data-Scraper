The people who are in charge of certain industries do not want to and *cant* (very important) loose money. If these other things take off they loose money and potentially the entire industry (plastic/oil). Why don't they just shift? That's when things get interesting in a dumb short of way. On one hand you have people who are just naturally resistant to change but also the system itself is against it. Most changes cost lots of money in the short run *at least* when your entire economics system is based on the fact that you can't make less money then you made yesterday, it makes a incentive to not change. Then there is a chance that a industry might not make as much money as the current one. Plastic is literally a bi product for example and doing plant based plastics means more money and effort then oil based. (There is some over simplifications in here)",

At best, this warrants additional studies on the material to learn more of its capabilities and limits.\n\nThe reason why single use plastic is so ubiquitous in the modern world is because it's versatile, quick to produce, extremely lightweight, and most importantly, cheap.\n\nThere's likely thousands of potential \"plastic killers\" out there that are being researched and studied at any given moment, but for one reason or another they will never make it to commercial viability.",

There is a cost to change and someone or something bears it. \n\nYou might feel that the greed of oil companies would lead to pushing down such discoveries but here is the thing: to replace this plastic, would you also be willing to stop using any petrol(gas)? Plastic is mostly/wholly afaik made from the byproducts/waste of natural oil. What will happen to that? If oil companies cannot sell that byproduct to plastic making companies and earn money, will it be viable for you to pay for petrol for your commute?\n\nThe cons of using plastic is naturally harmful to the environment and no one denies it but unless that cost to the environment is higher than the cost to replace multiple industries, it will not change. However, there is still change in novelty and niche products that start the transition. Like a petri dish for the whole of the market. They assess whether it will be viable to transition or not.\n\nThis seaweed plastic is not a new discovery. You might have also seen those water blobs about a decade old. They were all the rage to get rid of single use plastic bottles. However, what these news articles don't show is the impracticality of them. They had a shelf life of only three days and you needed a special machine to make them. \n\nThis plastic here is able to handle very high heat. Very nice. It biodegrades in weeks though. That means it starts decaying in a few days and would lose its desirable properties in a week or two. If you replace a plastic item with it, would it be costlier to replace it every two weeks in the long run? Imagine that item is used across the country, how much transport would be required for the item daily? Will the petrol not cause more harm to the planet to transport it or the raw materials from the coast to inland? \n\nThat being said, it is still a phenomenal discovery because it shows that progress is being made for a better alternative. Currently, electric and hybrid cars are making a dent in the market because the cost of using petrol is becoming higher but electric has not completely replaced petrol because it is still a costly alternative.",

The oil companies made huge profits last year (actually, biggest in history), partially because of the petrochemicals demand was so high.\nSo just imagine, that how much plastic are we producing, and actually, how mich moneay and how many jobs are connected to it.\nThe plastic industry\u2019s lobbying power is very strong, but kind of hidden behind oil companies.\n    I think it is a feverdream of mine, but considering how toxic the product they are creating for the environment, the best solution would be if the producing companies responsibility would be to also get rid of the plastic trash endproduct. (The same way, as nuclear plant not throughing their stuff in the ocean.)\nThis is just a dream, but an act like this would at least make the producing companies to consider and invest in recycling.\nThe current recycling is just a joke that they get away with.",

                    "comment": "Here\u2019s my perspective as an engineer who designs consumer electronics:\n\nI get all my hardware parts made by external vendors. In this case it would be a plastics injection molding company, or maybe a thermoformed plastic fabricator. These companies have their own engineers who I interface with, and take my design and ask me things like \u201chow hot/cold of temperature range will this need to handle?\u201d Or \u201chow strong does it need to be\u201d, and then they suggest materials to me, or we reconfigure parts of my design to improve stiffness, etc. \n\nThese engineers are getting their plastic supplies from ANOTHER vendor who does nothing but sell raw plastic materials to plastic fabricators. Sometimes I even get to talk to them as well. \n\nIf I ask \u201chey, can I make this part out of seaweed plastic?\u201d the fabricator company needs to say \u201cyes! Our machines can handle that specific material,\u201d and the raw material supplier has to say \u201cyes! We have it in stock in the right format for the fabricator\u2019s machines.\u201d Next I need to tell my boss \u201cwe\u2019re making this out of a plastic that we haven\u2019t used before.\u201d He\u2019ll want me to make sure that it passes the quality tests we put our other parts through, but our project schedule won\u2019t change while I spec something new just for the sake of my own conscious regarding the environment. I\u2019ll need to run tests on how it performs in heat, how strong it is, how it degrades in UV exposure, does it handle dyes and colors the way we want, does it carry a static charge that could hurt our electronics, etc. Plus I\u2019ll have to justify added costs that are likely incurred because the material supplier/fabricator have to use a new material. \n\nOr I could use polycarbonate like we have for the last 50 parts we made and no one will question me, and the material supplier will give the fabricator a discount for buying in bulk because other people\u2019s parts are also made out of polycarbonate. \n\nThat\u2019s a LOT of political capital I have to spend to make the supply chain switch. You want industry-wide change? Make it so much better AND so much cheaper that China and India start refusing to make it out of anything else because it\u2019s so much easier to work with. Until then, it\u2019ll be niche uses where marketing it as \u201cmade with eco-friendly materials\u201d makes up for the extra development time/cost.",

They used to be located in the Sargasso Sea but are now heading toward Florida and the Gulf states, turning into a rotting nuisance.  But the article also mentions an issue with novel uses for it because it apparently contains arsenic.  I'm guessing that would preclude its use for wrapping food stuffs, but I'm no expert.",

If you're also in the US,  there are quite a few grants available to help with that initial copay if your income (for a single person household) is around 50k or less.  If you don't have government insurance you are probably eligible for a copay card that would also significantly reduce your January copay (Look on the sprycel website).  If you end up unemployed you will likely qualify for free drug-- please dont consider yourself out of options if you lose your job.  The price of oral chemo is obscene and I spend hours everyday trying to help people manage copays.  I wish it wasn't so difficult to make care affordable.",

I didn't have any insurance, and it took almost a year to get diagnosed and treated. I continued to pay for the script for years. The seizures were the result of a head injury sustained during an assault. \n\nBonus is that I started smoking pot to deal with the side effects of the meds, and it was the pot stopping the seizures all along. They started again when I tried to quit. Now I'm off the medication, feel like myself again, and am using a plant to stay healthy instead of spending two hundred dollars a month on medication I didn't need.\n\nIf we could legalize the free and life-saving plant, I'd really appreciate it.",

To give you an idea, if I wanted to get 60 pills of 20mg Simvastatin in Portugal, I could easily find it for sale in a pharmacy for less than 3\u20ac and on top of that the state would pay for 37% of the cost. So all things considered, I'd pay less than 2\u20ac, that is, less than ~$2.30. If you [search it up on Mark Cuban's website](https://costplusdrugs.com/medications/simvastatin-20mg-tablet/), the same thing will cost you $4.80. Apparently that's still a huge discount as they list the average retail price as $26.40, so this is great news, but it just goes to show how America still has a long way to go.\n\nBtw, it seems like the \"15% markup\" is a bit misleading. For 20mg Simvastatin they list the manufacturing cost as $0.60 and the \"15% markup\" as $0.30... that is actually a 50% markup. And if you look at [10mg Simvastatin](https://costplusdrugs.com/medications/simvastatin-10mg-tablet/), they list the manufacturing as $0.30 and again the 15% markup as $0.30, which is a 100% markup. I guess the \"15% markup\" must have a minimum of $0.30, but I don't see it explained anywhere in the site.",

I know  our local pharmacy still has sertraline around the same price that mark Cuban's price of Zoloft ($74). That's a huge difference for someone who needs the medication.\n\nEDIT: Local pharmacy is around $74 as this website shows as the retail price. However the price this website charges is vastly cheaper to the order of being able to pay for 21 months of supply for the same cost as one month retail cost.",

                            "comment": "It comes down to AWP (Actual Wholesale Price). Now there are 4 major parties involved in determining the medication pricing. \n\nFirst is the drug manufacturer. (Pfizer Greenstone, Teva, Aurobindo, etc) They sell the product to party number two, a drug wholesaler (McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal etc.) Then the drug wholesaler sells it to party number three, the pharmacy, with a listed AWP listed for every product they sell. In your case this one is listed at $2400. Sometimes after each party has taken their cut it equals more than $72. Sometimes it\u2019s less. Either way for most brand name medications it is very seldom more than $2400.\n\nAnyway the pharmacy is like, \u201cGreat I can make so much money on this medication it sells for $2400 and I bought it for way less, right?\u201d WRONG.\n\nNo one pays AWP it\u2019s just some made up number by the Wholesaler.\n\nSo what happens? The pharmacy submits a $2400 claim to party number four, the insurance company, and the company says the patient only has to pay $72. \n\nThe insurance knows the med doesn\u2019t cost $2400 and they have a contract the pharmacy signed with them that states two major things:\n1. The price for this specific medication is $72, regardless of how much it cost the pharmacy to purchase it.\n2. If the pharmacy is found not using AWP when selling prescription drugs, they are no longer file claims with this insurance company.\n\nAnd in many cases (not sure about this specific one) the insurance doesn\u2019t pay the pharmacy any money. Many pharmacy departments, at least ones that haven\u2019t started monopolizing the healthcare industry by buying out Health Insurance Companies (CVS Aetna, Walgreens Humana) lose money.",

They were motivated in part by \u201cPharma Bro\u201d Martin Shrkeli\u2019s outrage-producing price hike of the lifesaving drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per tablet while Shrkeli was CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Cuban told Forbes last year the pricing for generic drugs was \u201cridiculous.\u201d He said he decided to put his name on the company to \u201cshow capitalism can be compassionate and to send the message I am all in.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how much he had invested in the company.\n\nare you telling me this could have existed all this time and this is the best we can do? what about all the talk politicians have been saying about these prices being absurd, and nothing has been done? the more I think about it the angrier I get. nobody should go bankrupt to stay alive.",

Really, bills need 60% approval to pass, except things that can be classified as bills that are resolving the budget only need 50%.  There may be other exceptions that I don't know about, but this is the general rule.\n\nThe majority party typically has a slim majority of less than 60%, but they can usually sway around 10% of the other party to agree with their votes.  So if they have 55%, that would give them 65% on their votes.  The problem for them comes up in two cases:\n\n1.  If they can't persuade at least 5% of the other party, then you hear a lot of talk about how the other side is being hyper partisan, but they usually give up quickly because it is hard to target individual representatives with public pressure in this case.  So they likely won't sway anyone to change to their side.\n\nor\n\n2.  If a few members of the majority party disagree with a vote, and there aren't enough from the other party to make up the difference, then they really put the pressure on by making it sound like only a few members are blocking a vote.  Really you have over 40% blocking a vote.  An example of this is happening right now in which the Democrats are able to get 58 votes for their agenda, but they need 60.  They are missing 2 votes from their own side; so they try to make it sound like 2 senators are blocking the vote.  Really 42 senators are blocking the vote, but if they can turn the public against the 2 senators on their own side and build enough public pressure against them, they hope that will change the minds of those 2 senators.  This was especially dishonest when they were using the same messaging last year during the budget resolution vote, since they only needed 50%, but they made it sound like 2 senators were holding up the whole thing.  This was wrong.  Over 50% were in opposition, but if they could convince either of the two who dissented in their own party, that would be enough.\n\n\nHonestly, they would see a lot less gridlock if they would vote on individual changes, rather than these giant packaged bills.  They will take any good idea that everybody agrees with and then pump the bill full of other stuff that only a few people want.  All the extra stuff kills the bill, but the people who want the shitty stuff in the bill will launch a huge pressure campaign where they point out all the good stuff in the bill and accuse the Congress of voting against all that good stuff when really, they were voting against the shitty stuff packaged in with the good stuff, but they don't mention the shitty stuff in their pressure campaign.",

The newer (and more expensive) insulin analogs work faster or last longer which gives people greater convenience and/or tighter control over their blood sugar which is why they're preferred these days. Regular insulin is usually reserved for people who can't afford the newer stuff. Kind of like a flip phone versus a smartphone.\n\nEdit: This is why I always shake my head when I hear about a diabetic dying because they couldn't afford their insulin. There is *usually* (not always) an affordable alternative out there, doctors and patients just need to work together to find it. I'm not defending pharmaceutical companies and their drug pricing shenanigans, but this is reality.",

That is regular insulin, which isn't the favored treatment of insulin-dependent diabetics. We have better man-made alternatives now. \n\nThe modern formulations are stronger and longer lasting than regular insulin. Regular insulin (like what's produced in your body) has a half-life of 5-10 minutes. The modern formulations of insulin, which have had modifications made to it at the molecular level, have a half-life measured in hours. Meaning they keep working for longer periods resulting in better long term control. Better long term control means better long term outcomes (IE, less incidence of kidney disease or vascular disease) IF the patient is compliant with the medication and dietary regimen. \n\nIt doesn't change the fact that Lispro and the other modern modified insulins are too fucking expensive though. But that original patent or whatever for the OG insulin just doesn't impact the modern formulations.",

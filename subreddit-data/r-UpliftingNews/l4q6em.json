For the cost of a single beer at a ball game you can buy half a case at home.  But you get more choices so you may end up going with a more local or expensive brand.

If you don\u2019t think that Budweiser will use this in marketing and commercials for years to come, I think you would be mistaken. \n\nI worked in the beer industry for a Bud distributor when they donated 250k worth of water to hurricane victims and then spent 25 million advertising the fact that they gave free water to hurricane victims. \n\nInBev only cares about their profits and their advertising. With the growth of craft, their power is all in their footprint and brand awareness. Though there have been highs and lows through the pandemic, overall alcohol sales are up since many people don\u2019t have anywhere to go and are bored shitless.\n\nEdit: fixed a double \u201ctheir\u201d",

They rely on the sponsorships to teams, stadiums, venues to keep other brands out or at the very least minimize the competitor\u2019s presence. Additionally, in states where it\u2019s legal the sponsored venues get special pricing on barrels or kickbacks per barrel bought. Where I worked any price increase on products were always dictated by what the stadiums were willing to pay, at least until we started bringing in \u201cspecial barrels\u201d that we listed as exclusive for the stadiums and had list pricing 30 bucks cheaper than we would sell to a store or bar. Don\u2019t get me started on how disingenuous I think it is that we sold the same product to a stadium for 68 cents and they mark it up to $10, and we sold it to a liquor store for 1.10 and they could only mark it up $1.79 or we would start pulling access to exclusives, limiteds, or other perks. \n\nIt\u2019s a marketing expense for them. Captive audience to maybe try a beer they had turned away from or just further imprinting the name Budweiser further into your psyche.",

The act itself was still selfish (in line with logic)\n\nSo yeah, I think only if you know doing the act of charity will harm you and everyone else then it can be truly unselfish. But then, is it really an act of charity. \n\nIt's just fun to think about.",

They are simply stating that they believe all acts are as such--not that this is a bad thing particularly.\n\nAnd this does not necessarily depend on a charitable act causing pain or doing literally nothing for the charitable actor--even then, under this doctrine, the act would still ultimately be self serving (since every act is).",

Every single thing about the agenda that gets promoted or criticized in regards to the economy comes down to one thing: creating predictable fluctuations in the stock market.\n\nThey want lower corporate taxes because it means bigger stock numbers. It doesn't mean more jobs. It just means bigger stock numbers.\n\nThe pearl clutching about immigrants is done to ensure that all the millions of people in the US don't get citizenship and continue working under the table for slave wages. It helps the bottom line. \n\nTrump and the GOP had zero plan for the virus or vaccine rollout. This was on purpose. Look at the stock market right now. Look at how rich people got. This virus has been the best thing to happen to them in years. The only people who can make money now are the established brands and companies that are already household names. The people on top are rising even higher and there's no competition at all. The longer this lasts, the more money they stand to make. And anyone who was in charge of the pandemic response knew to invest their money in it.\n\nEvery time the country talks about raising taxes or creating jobs or getting healthcare or doing anything in regards to the economy... what do conservatives always do? They talk about the stock market. They make historical comparisons to the stock market. They threaten what will happen to the stock market. They are only capable of measuring the strength of our economy through the DOW index.\n\nBut what good is productivity if it means [fuckall for workers?](https://i.imgur.com/UqCAJts.png) The majority of americans do NOT live off of their stock portfolio income. How would they even get any? They can barely afford rent and food.\n\nAll those stock dividends go somewhere. And they all go straight to the top. Productivity means fuckall to the majority of americans. Our economy is so sick and broken that it's a joke to even praise the stock market. Conservatives don't give two shits about our real economy. They just say whatever it takes to ensure that their investment portfolio continues to bloat.",

Few to none of us benefit day to day from market increases. Most of the investing middle class in a 401k or RSP or mutual funds are investing low to medium risk and medium to long term, not day trading or investing in hedge funds and huge IPOs and buying and selling to take advantage of short term gains. A gigantic portion of the lower and even middle class has nothing in savings or the market whatsoever and are just trying to pay the bills.

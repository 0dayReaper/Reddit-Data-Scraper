He was simply seeking for the answer \"how can you hate me when you don't even know me?\" and in letting the klan members answer that question, he allowed them to come to their own realization that they do not hate him.

The medium is the message. You're fooling yourself into justifying the energy you put into social media. I've loved the computer since I was 12, which was very long ago. I've had plenty of 'real' relationships here, and I'll tell you, none of them translated in any rational manner into reality.  Sure, I learned how the disconnect works, and of course, one can swim between. But there _is_ a disconnect between online and real life.  Ask yourself, when was the last time you discussed with someone the meme wars that took place on reddit with someone not intimately familar with reddit, in real life?",

You have no reason to exist your chamber, everything around you is agreeing with you.\n\nEver seen extreme liberal facebook? cancer. Every seen extreme conservative facebook? cancer. People never even SEE the other side, all they see from the other side are the own existing echo chambered views. \n\nAnd what i mean by this plays into the human psyche. A lot of people fear change, they like positive re-enforcement, the dislike negative, they like being right and ((((FEELING)))) right/smart, so what logical (and by logical i mean emotionally motivated) reason do they have to leave their echo chamber? everyone they see agrees with them, it makes them FEEL good, why would they leave that?

I used to visit r/tumblrinaction daily. I thought it was funny and they were making fun of idiots so, why not? Then I noticed it leeching into my real life. I was constantly angry because idiots like the ones they made fun of in the sub were everywhere! Only they weren't. It was me seeing someone who didn't hold views strongly one way or the other make a comment about race or gender and immediately thinking they must be like those people on tia. I would get so mad and start arguments, etc., When really those people I was encountering outside the sub weremostly just normal individuals who maybe held some inkling of those views but did not deserve to be attacked in any way for them. It also made me start to see the dumb SJW views in everything. I was basically turning into one but a crazed anti version. TL;DR echo chambers show you all the negatives of the opposing side in a very biased way, which makes you very angry at everyone and start to see it everywhere.",

People are constantly being caught on Reddit claiming to be gay, black, Jewish, Muslim, whatever, when they're not. Hell, we've seen accounts from users who claim shit like being a 41 year old white female school teacher one day, then a 15 year old transgender girl a month later. \n\n\nIf you believe everything you read in the Trump sub, for example, their users are almost more ethnically and sexually diverse than the rest of Reddit. It's way too easy for sociopathic assholes to manipulate public opinion when they are able to hide their true selves behind a computer screen. ",

Only by working together, collectively can we root out this ugliness and move towards a better more cohesive unity. \n\nThe reason most people are so frustrated about it, is when they voice their concerns, they are dismissed. Well it's their right. Maybe you're just taking things too seriously. Stop being so sensitive. Well what about so and so in this country suffering this, where is your bleeding heart for them?! \n\nNot actually addressing the issue is one of the issues persons have when bringing these things up. To some of us, the issue is real, because we experience it, we live it. But trying to convey it, we've tried talking, so what's next after talking? What's next after frustration of being ignored by your friends and family WHO AREN'T RACIST, but who also brush you aside?\n\nWhat then are people supposed to do?\n\nI love that this man's method work. I loved that he touched so many people and forced them to turn their hate in on itself. It's beautiful, it's hope. I don't deny that, but there are reasons that the issue is so loud, and it's not simply the media's fault. When we as a people start hearing one another and working towards a resolution as we should, instead of looking for reasoning to dismantle or discredit the actual problem, then more situations like this can occur.

You don't have to have had a broken arm to know how to fix it. It is when someone tells someone, this is racist, and we are told that we are being too sensitive, that we're racist for assuming that it's racist. When someone says something is racist, they aren't usually saying you are but merely the situation, phrase, way of thinking, etc, is. \n\nI talk like this, knowing there are unreasonable people out there, quick to judge, point fingers and shut down white men and women or other nationalities who try to understand with condescending tones, speech, etc. I'm sorry if that's happened to you. Know that I will never do that, my ear is yours if you need to ask questions and my perspective is yours to offer if you need to see.\n\nLogically, racism is counter productive. Superiority is a subjective ideal. We would make more progress, collectively without it. Competition of course is the natural state of nature, though. So perhaps we could do with less trying to topple one another and more working together collectively to make this country greater than and and more long lasting thank any before it.\n\nAlas, ego.",

I pointed out that, even morals aside, this makes no sense, from a logistical or historical perspective, that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, that even if you could crush that kind of ideology (never achieved on that scale ever in human history) you'd create a power vacuum that would likely lead to further war, and that the vast overall reduction in human suffering we've achieved in the modern world has been through interlinking cultures and peoples more, not through poorly-thought out blitzkriegs on vast swathes of humanity.\n\nThen I deleted it, because what am I going to do, convince him? By arguing I'm implying that he has an argument. It's wrong to kill civilians. Waging a war against a religion isn't just wrong, it's phenomenally stupid. So I said nothing.\n\nYou may well be right, that I need to type these things out, again and again, if I believe them so much. Perhaps it is arrogance of holding these truths to be self-evident that causes such division. Nothing is self-evident. We have a  responsibility to make it evident, and explain why.

It's the unanswered questions, the realization that one's arguments are weak, and the repeated exposure to more logical positions that is most likely to actually change someone's mind. \n\nThink of it as planting seeds.

Needless to say, none of them knew a transgender person. \nI can imagine it's similar for racist individuals who have only heard about stereotypes (built on fear).",

Superman, for instance, was created by two Jews, and it's been observed that he has a lot of similarities to the myth of Judah Loew's golem, which is well-known in Jewish folklore. All of which basically means that America's favorite superhero was written from the point of view of members of a minority. And his perspective rubbed off on people who weren't very familiar with such a perspective. He advocated acceptance and tolerance and human brotherhood at a time when those weren't necessarily the things people thought of as essential to \"the American way.\" And now they're first and foremost in many people's minds.",

Think about it: militias are generally formed by people who see themselves as freedom fighters, ready to throw off the yoke of government oppression with violence if need be. But when he contemplates the history of his own country, it's the blacks that threw off the yoke of slavery, and won freedom away from a government oppression. They had nothing, and won. It's the most incredible story of freedom fighting in modern history, with incredible black heroes like Tubman and Douglas. (Maybe the closest white parallel was Spartacus 2000 years ago.)\n\nAnd the white militia guys sees all this, and sees his ancestors were the bad guys. It's gotta sting on some level.",

Plenty of people have enough of their own problems to deal with that they don't have time or energy left to deal with other people's/society's problems, and that's fine.  Especially when it comes to not dealing with them in a way that puts themselves at danger like this black man dealing with KKK members.\n\n***BUT***.  This is how you change people's minds.  Insulting and demeaning them isn't going to work nearly as well as kindness and persuasion, as showing them that they're wrong rather than simply telling (or claiming).  In today's political climate it's a rather important message, especially for liberals.  I say liberals because they're the pony I'm backing, the one I want to see have a bit more success than they did this year.\n\nJumping straight to calling anyone worried about immigrants or refugees racist is easy, but it's not going to change minds.  You need to be able to engage in these topics in meaningful ways or else you just make things worse by dismissing and insulting them.  If someone can't openly talk about immigration issues in certain places without being called racist, they'll just go to the places they can.  And the actual racists will be all too happy to engage with them about immigration and refugees.  If there's no reasoned counter-point people will find themselves getting sucked in by the racists.  Because, are they really racists?  \"I was called racist just for asking this question, it's probably the same for them\".   Little do they know that person talking to them is also saying \"Only white people can support western culture\".\n\nSo no.  You personally don't have to take responsibility for convincing everyone who disagrees with you, but at least don't be a dick.  Don't just insult and demean those who disagree with you, because it just makes it all that much harder for those trying to convince them to agree with you.",

He never intended to change them, he wanted to understand why they hated him. What if we could do that with everyone in the world even with simple arguments or the biggest hatreds?

However, as a black person, I should not have to **prove** to racists that I am worthy of respect and to be treated with dignity despite the color of my skin. That's bullshit. It's not the job of the black people to convince those who hate us because of our race to treat us like human beings. I am uncomfortable with the message this is sending.",

However, this is certainly just an extreme example of what every well-adjusted brown skinned person must do just to get by in the world. Well the US at least since that's all I can speak to.

'We do not hate anyone,' imperial wizard says](http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/12/a-kinder-gentler-ku-klux-klan-we-do-not-hate-anyone-imperial-wizard-says/) from 2012\n\n[we arent racist or even white supremecists, just white separatists.. like the bible says.](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/white-supremacists-kkk-groups-claim-44106420)\n\nand really anyone who has lived in the deep south knows the concept, \"i'm not  a racist.. BUT\" is nearly a mantra down here. being a racist is a negative thing, so people simply will do mental gymnastics inside their heads and show how they arent a racist.\n\nlike trump.. they are all murderers and rapists but i am sure a few are decent people. \n\nthats how they feel.. they know a minority person they dont spit on.. and therefore they \"arent a racist...BUT black people are inherently lazy and living off welfare and it pisses me off because my son gets such small welfare checks because all teh able bodied black people are sucking up all the money\"\n\nits really common for some of the biggest bigots to deny it even to themselves down here.\n",

The idea that police are doing the job of every first responder is laughable. Especially when reported numbers of officers are declining and most agencies/departments are struggling to find warm bodies to fill positions.",

All they do is knock on doors and get people out of the buildings, they don't go interior because they do not need to, new building methods and materials make a burning house basically unsurvivable after 10 min, the fire dept first due aren't on scene until 6 minutes from the call, so the cops are indeed saving those lives, just by pounding on doors. Narcan delivered nasally which most police depts now have is saving ODs way before we get on site. CPR does shit all compared to Narcan for saving ODs. \n\nAEDs are in almost every cop car, an AED that is applied to a shockable rhythm in the first six minutes of a cardiac event drastically improves the chance of the victim walking out, again, cops are first in scene.\n\nI know that hating on cops is a reddit thing, but they save more lives than other first responders.",

Not every call emergency medical services show up to is life threatening either, of course, but their whole job is attending to serious medical episodes so it's going to be pretty common for them.",

Officers incorrectly assess medical situations &amp; withhold medical care often. More deaths in police custody happen due to neglect than gun violence. They are also not properly trained to handle emergency medical situations.",

            "comment": "A group of researchers has developed a portable supercapacitor that can be charged using light in a collaborative project involving institutions in India and South Korea.\r  \n\r  \nThe invention holds promise for replacing the conventional lithion-ion batteries in portable and wearable devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches.\r  \n\r  \nThe study, which has been published in peer-reviewed journal Journal of Power Sources, was undertaken by researchers from University College, Thiruvananthapuram; IIT Guwahati; Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology; Korea Institute of Energy Technology; and Chonnam National University in South Korea.\r  \n\r  \nThe lead author Rani J.R., an Assistant Professor of Physics at Government Women\u2019s Polytechnic at Kaimanam, points out that supercapacitors are an alternative charge storage device which can store electric charge similar to traditional batteries.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, supercapacitors\u2019 capability of getting charged and discharged quickly makes them ideal for applications requiring short power bursts such as wearable devices and electric vehicles. Besides, they exhibit long life since they are not subject to chemical degradation as in conventional batteries.\r  \n\r  \nA supercapacitor device consists of an electrode, electrolyte and a current collector. The researchers developed a design involving a stainless steel electrode with a quartz transparent window in order to harvest visible light. A specially prepared \u2018down-conversion\u2019 phosphor is introduced before the quartz window to facilitate light-induced charging.\r  \n\r  \nThis tech would vastly improve the wearables sustainability. Given the sub-par battery life of wearables , these super capacitors can help provided much needed longevity.\r  \n\r  \nRest of the claims in the post are to be tested in real-life situation.",

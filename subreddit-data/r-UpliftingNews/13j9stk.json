Didn't swim till the boat was a speck but it is not uncommon to go for a swim offshore in the doldrums.  The ocean gets like glass and you can not see a ripple for as far as the eye can see, that tells you there is no wind anywhere near you nor will there likely be anytime soon.  When the wind goes flat like that visibility in the ocean increases dramatically so you can also easily see if there are any fish in the area, also the lack of sea birds can be an indicator.   While it sounds dangerously crazy in actuality it is not uncommon among blue water sailors at all.",

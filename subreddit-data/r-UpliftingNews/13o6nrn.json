Kansas voters preserved abortion access by a pretty stout margin. \n\nThe governor Laura Kelly is a Democrat. One of the 4 state reps is a Native American Lesbian. It's not as deep red as often construed (has its deep red moments of course, and we are all sorry about having produced Kris Kobach). Even in the small rural town I live in I'd say in 2020 the Trump signs were about 60%, Biden signs 40%. That's a big margin in terms of polling but in reality that's a pretty mixed bag. The reason it never seems like that though is that 51% == total victory.",

So it isn't like it's a new phenomenon. \n\nYou're right about the previous governor Sam Brownback though. Republicans got full control over both chambers and the governorship and with help from the national party and Republican economists they put together something called the Kansas Experiment. The idea was to enact fully and without compromise, Republican economic doctrine - the goal being to prove without a doubt that the policies would cause the economy to boom. \n\nInstead the economy utterly tanked, even relative to other states in the region (everyone had some degree of recession, just in Kansas it was economic freefall rather than a downturn). And yes, the state pragmatically voted a lot of those goofs out of office.",

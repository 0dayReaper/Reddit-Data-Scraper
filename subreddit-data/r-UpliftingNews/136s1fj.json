Very smart. Not fixed. Good with kids.\u201d\n\nThe note revealed that the owner lost their job and apartment and could no longer afford to care for Max.\n\nMany people showed up, interested in adopting Max but THS confirmed that last Friday, \u201che found the family he now calls his own.\u201d\n\n&gt;THS added: \u201cHis new family already loves him so much and he has a new dog sibling too!\u201d",

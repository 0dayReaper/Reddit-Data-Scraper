Because, in truth we also had issues with one person spraying insane \"air fresheners\" and that triggering migraines in people.\n\nA general rule can often be better than a specific rule.

I'm sure you have seen YouTube videos for training purposes that show someone with long hair getting it caught in machinery. I sure have. It is also bad to wear certain clothing that may become caught in machinery. A co-worker at the cannery I worked at one summer lost an arm because his shirt sleeve caught up on a conveyor belt.

If we can get some changes before the 2024 election, we might gain some ground and hopefully motivate better turnout for the 2026 election  when we have another major election affecting the majority of state offices.",

They damn well will if they catch you driving with it.\n\nAlso you can buy shrooms and THC over the counter now because of the farm bill and that its \"synthetic\".\n\nYou can get just as high. SO essentially, if it comes from the plant, its kinda illegal if your driving with it. But with the new stuff over the counter, again only illegal if driving with it as both are DUIs or DWIs etc. IE under the influence of a drug. They'll arrest you for being loopy on prescribed meds if they feel you are being unsafe enough like on codeine or hydrocodone.\n\nIt has been years since Ive seen a buddy get hammered for pot or harassed about it. If you walk by the student apartments and the frat houses you can smell it ALL the time. I new a dealer who lived on the same floor, but opposite side of building. that corner of the building smelled like weed. Everyone knew he was dealing. No one stopped him. And he had his own vending machine, and own commercial soda machine n stuff (Like one from McDonalds). Very expensive things (that were NOT stocked by him, he was loaded from dealing just MJ enough to where he had contracts to have them refilled.\n\nThe bill had some serious support. It went through numerous committees in the house, was read thrice, then went to senate committees, then died in reading. So it was much closer than people think.\n\nBut for years this has been tossed around in the legislature and they dont make it more illegal, like the new over the counter stuff, the department of health tried to make it illegal without going through the process and NUMEROUS judges attacked em and stuck it down, so in Texas: weed is de facto legal. Your real worry nowadays in Texas with weed is trying to find a job and pass the piss test.\n\n\nSource: Am in Texas, AND in a more conservative leaning area.\n\n\n***Also, in Texas, its not Dems Vs Repubs. They are all conservative. Its more like less conservative guys vs more conservative guys. It is NOTHING similar to the federal polarity. They arent at eachothers throats like they are federally.*** To put it in perspective, Federally, Conservatives are always republican, and democrats are always liberal. Wheras, its far more mixed across the state level in many many states. Austin is just about the only REALLY truly liberal area IN THE ENTIRE STATE. Dallas/Houston/San Antonio are blue, but Austin is like CALIFORNIA big city Blue in comparison. Austin has a large influx of californians coming in actually, hence why its so blue by comparison. And people hate it because its causing massive tax increases in that area, and more importantly ***Rent and home ownership prices is skyrocketing, its actually really bad. Houses and rent cost much more than they used to. A house where I live in a decent city costs less than a house that is far shittier by comparison as it gets closer to the austin area. sometimes 2-4x price difference for a house HALF the size!***\n\nA lot of conservatives I know are 100% fine with weed. Even more so because they know they can grow ***a fuckload of it*** if it was legalized. And you wouldnt really need a grow house. Your backyard in the summer, provided you have water, which is p cheap in texas (4000 gallons is like 25 dollars where I live) would be near perfect if growing in bulk.\n\nEdit: Lots of typos/grammar. Typed really fast and am super tired. Fixed some. If I missed some lmk\n\nTexas is not as bad as the national media makes it out to be. Its more really RED STATE BAD AND EVIL. And it honestly breaks my heart that people genuinely compare us to Iran, etc when it really isn't the case. Reddit really hates texas. The churches I went to were very mixed race, even in a small town, our school was mixed as well, and serviced numerous local towns, and arguably, one of the better schools within 50 miles. My town heavily invested in that school it was the pride and joy. It was an honor to get the hell out of that town and go to college etc. We had a low asian demographic (one family out of like... 250 total families in town (total town pop of 1500 at the time or so)) but when they moved it it was more, huh, first asian family, but they still live there. And I still talk to their son (as he was a great friend of mine for at least 8 years, 4 in HS, 4 in college). But really, really, REALLY, isnt that bad. The shit you see in the media is very surface level. Things like abortion are illegal, texas frowns on some left policies, but also in texas, in family courts etc, favor women ***greatly***. My mother and my father agreed to joint custody for example, and the court still tried to throw that out because \"The father wont be home all of the time.\" Even though my father bought another HOME to stay with me closer to my moms and my school so he had a place to sleep and we wouldnt be far from my mother 3-4 days out of the week. I was 12. My sister was 11. We were home alone more often either way than I could count because both of them worked all of the time. We walked home from school etc.\n\nSorry. Personal rant. Our courts are fucking stupid in many ways. That is one of the many reasons and you could have an entire bachelors degree about how stupid convoluted the texas courts are (and it was done that way due to prior abuses of power etc) And I am not talking about the laws being stupid, Im talking about their dumb ass convoluted structure.\n\nAnd to clarify before people start attacking me, I'm literally dead center on the political spectrum. I am not a Liberal or a conservative. Every political test I have taken (like the political compass) im on the center or right next to it.\n\nI expect to be downvoted to hell. And It does make me a bit sad. But thats OK. I wont be mad at anyone really for hating me for living in my state, or hating my state. I just want to say my piece. Texas gets a lot of hate and no one really talks about why or gets into civil discussions. It usually ends with \"Conservatives fucking suck, stfu\" and thats the end of it usually.",

Instead, it's seen as unkempt, unprofessional, ugly, and used as a way to punish or remove black workers at their place of employment. \n\nThere are quite a few articles that have been recorded of incidents and such..even outside work, it's been caught in public schools as well, where kids get removed or get forced to cut their hair without their parents approval.\n\nYou'd think that it's not trivial, but it's been like this for a long ass time, and sad that it took this long for something to be done about it, but it's a start.\n\n\nAnyway, if you're truly interested in learning about it check out the website, which gives more context:\n\nhttps://www.thecrownact.com/",

To give you some examples, I've known someone who's natural hair was ginger and rather wiry, and someone who's hair dried into curls like a Victorian chocolate box girl.\n\nIn both cases, they really struggled with their natural hair because they were taught that you had to wash and brush it far more often than suits that sort of hair. \n\nIt's daft (but unsurprising) that we are only now starting to become more reasonable about how people's hair grows - one of Charles Dickens' stories has an aside about a girl in an orphanage/work-house (actually being parent-less seems to have been a minor detail at the time). The (white) character is perpetually being punished because her hair can't be tied up neatly like the other girls - and she isn't allowed to plat it either. I can't remember the exact quote, but basically it's considered vanity/showing off for her hair to look like richer girl's even though she is doing her level best to conform to the expected standards.",

Way smaller and tighter curls than anything your white ass genes are capable of. \nCheck all [these](https://naturallycurly.ca/pages/curly-hair-types) types out. \n\nC curl is very common in Africa and for a lot of people with this hair, requires very specific management techniques as it's very very difficult to comb the super tight curls.\nThey can cornrow it to keep it low profile, left to expand it becomes huge(like an afro!) \nThey can afro it.\nThey can use a special rubber or foam brush and make it go all bally if it's short. Often men will have the short balled up style as it's easy to maintain. See [here](https://www.amazon.in/curling-haircut-twisted-hairstyle-hairstyles/dp/B07F7R42GS)\nOr they can dread it.\n\nIf you've read this far, I'll tell you a secret, no one of black African descent has straight hair. None. Zip. Them be wigs or chemically straightened. And let me tell you now, 95% are wigs. \n\nThey cannot easily straighten it, or braid it or any normal white person hairstyle it. \nSaying no afros is like saying no straight hair that has been combed. It's fucking stupid that people get treated like that and for my nephew's I've had to tell the school myself their policies in 2023 against small afros that are well kept and natural are racist.\nAnd policies against small dreads that are well kept and convenient for the child are racist.\n\nThis is good news for the boys in this story and I hope it spreads across the world.",

Every time I hear this mentioned, I really wish I could see it someday so I can tell the person who is asking to touch right the fuck off. Not that I would, but it\u2019s a fantasy in my head. Because I kind of feel like one of the older Black women, who have told me to watch my purse or looked out for me in public, is going to put her foot down for me someday. I want to be that kind of grandma for someone. This has been my fantasy about solidarity, thanks for coming to story time, I\u2019ll see myself out",

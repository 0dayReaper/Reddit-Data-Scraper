The thing I hate the very most, is parents who are not willing to take responsibility for their actions or lack of actions. The worst are parents who take all the praise when a kid turns out great, &amp; they say they had nothing to do with the kid if they turn out terrible. George Carlin said it best when he said that, parents are the most full of bullshit. All of the credit, none of the responsibilities &amp; downfall. The only people who ever deserve to be parents, are those who are just as much, if not more so, willing to take responsibility for the kids themselves when things go bad. For all adults who do not take that responsibility, they should never have the rights to affect a child\u2019s life.\n\nAlso, I wanted to interject a thought I had on the main post\u2026 \n\nWhat if the kid(s), find out that they are not gay? Will they still be allowed to stay with a foster parent(s) that are met through this sort of predicament? In other words, will they be allowed to find a forever home, even if the conditions change? Or, will they be thrown back into the foster care system? This seems like an important clause to consider\u2026",

The caveat here is that if you have a foster/adopted child who is LGBTQ+ and you're failing to support them, or worse being blatantly trans/homophobic ... that's what this whole thing is about.  \n\nI have seen a local social-services outreach program that pairs foster/adoptive families with LGBTQ+ representatives as a sort of \"Big Brother/Big Sister\" type of organization, but for the whole family.  Support, a caring ear, extra hands to help out and make the whole thing work.  That seems to me like a decent approach.  \n\nOf course this is also a sort of a side-eye to the agencies and organizations that are refusing to place any children with LGBTQ+ prospective parents at all.  There's also the ones who refuse to place children with disabled parents, regardless of whether the child themselves is disabled or not.",

They forced us to go to church and listen to a bunch of b******* from the Bible. I showed them though. I haven't spoken to either one of them since 1989. They're both dead to me. I already had a job when they kicked me out. I finished high school, I worked two jobs and I retired at age 48. I have been married to my wonderful husband for almost 24 years. We've had two children that are loving and accepting of everyone. Our children are straight by the way. Because you can't groom a person to be gay. You are just born that way.",

It's also much needed as are families of color to increase culturally diverse placements and culturally sensitive communities in foster care (this is where real reform begins- interperso al exchanges that raise awareness to needs and gaps a homogeneous group may miss). I think exclusionary placements based on orientation is a road we want to travel with a lot of forethought and care beyond the statment it makes. \n\nSome important questions to ask are: Do we want to exclude exemplary placements just because they're x? Do we want to set a precedent like this, and are we prepared for the unintended negative consequences (they always exist, its a whole topic in policy planning)? Are we prepared for bad outcomes and the magnifying glass that will be on them- not if, bc those are always a risk in these situations no matter the best intentions. But  **are we prepared for the scrutiny and being proactive to prevent it**? Does this further the ultimate and most important goal in foster care and foster care reform i.e.  ***creating safe placements for children in loving and accepting homes that can best support them regardless of race, sex, etc***. \n\nCreat good programs, but don't sacrifice purpose for messaging would be my thoughts on an undertaking like this.",

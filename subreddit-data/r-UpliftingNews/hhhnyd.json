Kids asked if I wanted one, I said BRB as I was heading to front door. I knocked, gave the dad the order, got paid, got a $5 tip.  I walked back, ordered up a lemonade, paid and got back to my car. \n\nBefore I could put it in drive, the dad came up and secretly handed me another $5 for buying the cup.\n\nBTW: The lemonade was very good.",

One time a guy came up and gave us $20 because he just appreciated us \"being little entrepreneurs.\" We lived pretty close to a grocery store, so one summer my friends and I would take turns taking some of our profits and running to the store and buying generic brand sodas. We would sell the cups of Kool-Aid for 50 cents each or the sodas for $1 each. One day we made around $150 total, which was divided 4 ways, but as an 11 or 12 year old kid that was huge.\n\nI'm sure that the stand itself was technically illegal, as well as reselling the Kool-Aid and sodas, but nobody ever tried to stop us. It's wild to me how common these stories are now, unfortunately.",

So while they might initially feel bad, (\"Maybe I overreacted?\") which turns into indignation (\"If they'd just followed the *rules* about skating at the school, I wouldn't have had to yell at the kid and call the cops! This is the fault of the new generation.) \n\nThey've learned this is how to indirectly get their way while maintaining \"innocence\".",

Back in the 70s, during the gasoline crisis, there would be very long lines just for people to go get gas for the cars. Billy got it into his head to sell lemonade and snacks to the people waiting in line, and as I recall he was forced to stop because he didn\u2019t have a permit.  I think that\u2019s the end of the story. He didn\u2019t go get a permit or anything. They just crushed his little entrepreneurial spirit.  My friend had the news article about her big brother hanging in her locker 10 years later. Yeah\u2026 That seems weird in retrospect, but at the time it seemed totally normal.\n\nEdit: everything is on the Internet! The judge ruled he didn\u2019t need a permit. The question arose because the local luncheonette got pissed because his coffee was less than that at the luncheonette.  The whole article is not about my friend\u2019s brother, but if you scroll down, its in there.  Also, it was only five years later.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/04/archives/notes-from-the-gas-line.html",

Note: It depends on your state, however:\n\n&gt;A similar license from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs will run $388 for two years. However, there is a $70 application fee and a $25 endorsement fee. So, this paperwork alone will set your lemonade mogul back almost $500, even before they factor in the cost of citrus fruits and plastic cups.\n\nNow tell me how this doesn't disproportionately affect the poor..",

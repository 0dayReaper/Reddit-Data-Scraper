Since hyenas generally take turns attacking and harassing their prey I would imagine being confined to an enclosed space would give the boars the upper hand as they could more easily savage the hyenas with their tusks.  The hyenas wouldnt be able to escape nor would other hyenas be able to attack from the rear.  Depends on the size of the den too I suppose.",

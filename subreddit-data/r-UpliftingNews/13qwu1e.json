I get one - on average - I suppose about 8-9 months generally.\n\nI use the number for everything (I don't have a landline) and all I did was sign up to my country's equivalent (called TPS in the UK).\n\nI have no \"blocking\" on my phone whatsoever.  If I don't recognise the call, I don't pick up.  If I google that number and it's associated with a scam, I file a TPS report.  Never get the same number twice, and it goes quiet for months afterwards.\n\nWhen you laugh at our data protection laws, bear in mind that I'm talking TWENTY YEARS with the same, well-publicised number that I use for business, personal, provided to friends, employers, services, Amazon deliveries, etc. and I've never had even 1% of the problem you're talking about.\n\nThe problem is entirely synthetic - America LETS these companies do this, and you guys tolerate it.\n\nAlso... I don't have to pay for receiving any call whatsoever.  I hear some places have such a stupid system that they expect you to pay for receiving an unsolicited call from someone that you don't yet know who it even is.",

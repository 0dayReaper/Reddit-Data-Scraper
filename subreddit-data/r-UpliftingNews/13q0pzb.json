But philanthropy and charity are as the poster pointed out, almost always used to increase the wealth of the donations. Often at our cost, consider how much taxes the rich avoid paying, now consider how that money could be used publicly. On say universal healthcare or care workers for those with different needs, so they could attend more things and be included, or grants to businesses to improve accessibility. \nHim doing this is nice but it could societally be at the cost of accessibility for ALL of us in the long run. \n Not this dude personally, but his colleagues and probably friends",

And 3 having a combination of the two where you involve 3rd party companies or my favourite simply send said donation to a charity owned and run by a local politician who can then vote on taxation regulations you prefer.

In 1 if you give money to charity, then pay yourself a salary with that money, you are just netting to zero deduction, because the deduction is offset by the extra income.  In 2, in the US at least, this is just a failure to understand marginal taxes.  You only pay the higher rate on the amount above the bracket change.  This makes as much sense as someone saying they don't want to earn extra money because it would push them into a higher bracket.  The logic is wrong every time.",

You did this based entirely on your personal and cultural perspective on what makes a \"good\" or \"bad\" name. How is that anything but xenophobic? \n\nWhat you did is no different from a white American telling a Hispanic that \"Jose\" isn't a real name or suggesting that an Indian man should not name his daughter \"Arushi\" because it sounds \"awful.\"\n\nBy describing the foreign name as \"awful,\" you are displaying a lack of respect for the sound and meaning of a name that is likely significant to a large number of people from a particular culture. Such language suggests a dismissive and intolerant attitude towards those who are different from you, which is absolutely a form of xenophobia. Language, names and culture are deeply intertwined, and by disrespecting one, you are dismissing the others.\n\n&gt; Because as an authority on myself, I can tell you that I didn't.\n\nWow, this reads like the kinda shit a chud incel \"sigma male\" would say lol. Get some therapy and read some books that weren't written by angry white men.",

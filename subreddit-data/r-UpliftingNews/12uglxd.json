He can't sign it because of them, but he can't veto it again because we had the votes to override. He's on his last term as Governor, but Delaware politicians love playing musical chairs. Allowing it to pass will look better when he runs for Senate or whatever\n\nEdit: source, I am a political operative based in Delaware. A month or so ago when the situation became clear I made it public knowledge that this was his best course of action",

There's something called \"The Delaware Way\". We're making progress especially the last 5yrs or so in challenging the status quo here. A big part of that was getting new blood in the legislature, which I am happy to say was a pet project of mine, and the only reason we were able to get this passed. There's still plenty of work to do though",

Safe, easy to get, legal, you know exactly what you're getting. More public awareness as well, my college has signs like, \"Edibles aren't the same as smoking! Start small\" and stuff like that.",

They're essentially run by Mexican drug cartels and are much more organized and lethal than the typical American street gang. \n\nSure, Jim Bob might not get charged for buying pot but that is it. The legal pot stores aren't the problem. The problem is all the illegal growing operations that had propped up. And when they can sell at a fraction of the cost (illegal immigrants, zero regulations, forced labor) the illegal market is booming. \n\nMajor difference between then and now is that stuff was typically done on a small scale and typically outside of California/USA and smuggled in. Now the cartels have set up shop in California. I honestly never though the cartels would move in with such force after legalization, but that turned out to be completely wrong.",

                                    "comment": "I'd agree with pilots, but I will actually make the case for flight crew and such. This isn't a hill I'd die on either, because I understand the logic, but fuck it it's the internet and I'm bored and do believe this. Just so you know I'm not gonna waste your time with a stupid reddit weed bro response, the jist of my argument is privacy and lesser of two evils.\n\nI agree with the pilots and listed air traffic controllers first because they are fully the last line of defense if something goes wrong. However, air travel is very well regulated. There is a lot of redundancy and checks to minimize and correct errors made by less important staff, but people who have to act fast and immediately for hundreds of people's lives should have that sort of error minimizing applied to them too. FAA pilots have a lot of restrictions on medications, including not allowing people on anti-depressants. They already have quite strict requirements on what the pilots can take, and I think it's reasonable.\n\nHowever, for the jobs that can go slower and have more redundancy, I don't think regular testing for weed is reasonable. First, weed stays in your body for a month or more. I don't think people should be allowed to show up to work off their ass, however we're not where we need to be to be able to tell if they just smoke on the weekend or for sleep. Saliva tests are really good for testing if someone has done hard drugs within a short period of time, but doesn't effectively test for recent weed consumption. We can easily find out if someone is drinking or snorting coke on the job, not weed tho. I don't think it's reasonable to prevent someone from doing something on their time off unless you can prove them doing said things on their time off prevents someone from doing their job. We don't prevent them from drinking on their time off, I think it should be the same with weed. However, I believe this is an issue that will sort itself out as weed is legal for longer, better and more immediate testing will come.\n\nSecond, many workshops have to specifically clear things like Methadone and Tramadol, the two most popular long term opiates, or anxiety meds like Xanax. Methadone is used widely for taper off opiates, so those people have explicit protection through the ADA to work if their job doesn't demand a bunch of quick decision making. All you have to do to get on methadone is show up to the clinic every morning, pay for your stuff, and talk to a councilor. There's a doctor supervising it, and it's a great option for those people, but that's all you need for legal protection to work most jobs on an opiate. That's the current state of manual labor, and I've definitely seen some questionable hiring choices made considering that. I am okay with this though. Although methadone clinics can certainly be exploited for this reason, most people are actually trying to recover and just slowly reducing the amount they need to take in order to not be sick. I'd feel different about it if the doctor didn't expect most people to drive themselves. With that being said, I would much rather those people just smoke some weed because that's far less inebriating than many of the popular legally protected meds, and assists with the withdrawal of almost everything. Like I said, lesser of two evils. I believe weed should get protection in cases like these for the sake of reducing the use of other drugs that are already protected. People should be able to take the safer option without fear of losing their jobs, yk?",

You can mirror a lot of these questions by asking yourself, would it be ok if this person was \"drunk\" while performing their task?  If you shutter to even imagine, then we probably want to stick with having that person be sober from mind altering substances.  Like many have pointed out, when commercial travel is involved, we have a certain expectation that the person in control is competent and capable of performing the task.  Air travel, CDL drivers, police, surgeons, heavy equipment operators  they all have tasks that require a clear head.  \n\nThis actually kinda all happened before fokes, look back at history too.  Back before the industrial revolution and modern workplace safety, it was common for everyone to be drinking beer as their main hydration drink!  For lunch, on a work day, people were drinking beer!   Now many know that our founders were all big beer drinkers too, after all it was safer than WATER.  But when almost the entire population are farmers, you can be not so clear headed or quick when your farming by hand and animal.   However, as more and more jobs became industrialized (think dangerous equipment), vehicles entered, and more and more complexity and speed came into our day-to-day world, things changed.  This all brought about safety laws and much later things like OSHA and other aspects to remove large risks from society.  \n\nThis also brought about a change of expectations.  We went from a world in which someone being drunk and doing their job (a functioning alcoholic) was largely ignored unless they became a \"drunkard\" or an alcoholic.  And once society starts to culturally shift, it spreads across society naturally.  You might think it then only applies directly with physical elemental safety, however you can see through history that it spreads far beyond once a society takes it as a norm.\n\nNow I'm in no way meaning that any consumption of marijuana turns you into the worst intoxicated individual we can imagine (Reefer Madness bullshit).  No, the world is more nuanced than that.  However, unlike alcohol, thanks to all the prohibitions on marijuana, there hasn't been the research and innovations that society has had regarding alcohol.  One thing is for certain...change.",

Its based on science, not the public's presentation of what is drunk.  And when I say it's based on science, I mean exactly that, data driven science rather than speculation.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) created Standardized Field Sobriety Testing (field tests) to accurately determine if a person is under the influence.  This is how 100% of police in the United States determine if a driver is intoxicated.  Just like alcohol is legal to consume, the state must use probable cause and investigate if a crime is being committed.  There already exists an entire enforcement infrastructure that can appropriately determine if a driver has been driving under the influence of intoxicating drugs.  Prove impairment and then obtain a sample of blood evidence for lab determined measurements.  Nystagmus (eye based visual) tests already are tools to accurately make these types of determinations. \n\nAnd if your thinking you want a portable machine to do a test, the same one for alcohol (a PBT), isn't used to determine intoxication, its only admissible to indicate the presence of alcohol, the police officers observations and field tests are what matter most.",

If an accident happens with heavy machinery, the workers involved are tested for alcohol in the blood, which is determined in seconds, then follow up investigations are made. \n\nTHC stays in the system far longer than the period of time you're intoxicated for and there's no quick breath test to say if you've had a hit that day or not. Testing positive for smoking on the weekend is still a positive test result. You have no way of proving you didn't smoke that morning before an accident, but cops have a way to show that THC is in your system. If we're holding weed to the same standard as alcohol, you'd be considered under the influence.\n\nIt boils down to testing positive to weed in the system on a piss or swab test should have repercussions as testing positive to registering on a breatho. You all seem to want it treated equally, that's treating it equally and yes that means you can lose your job over it",

So, the police don't have to change anything, they just may see more of it as access and opportunity increases.  Delaware has never taken saliva or urine regarding DUIs, it's either breath or blood.  And a blood test can easily show levels of cannabinoids that the state will have to testify amounts to a \"per se\" level of driving under the influence (per se meaning that, like 0.08 BAC you can considered intoxicated regardless of the effect on your motor functions and the like).  However, with that being said, just about all DUI have more than testing alone, they have the observations of the police and possible Standardized Field Sobriety Test to provide evidence of the crime.  Remember, you're innocent until proven guilty, so the state has to prove you are guilty of the crime.\n\nNow regarding your opinion that you can go past the legal drinking limit and \"no feel or show signs\" I'd like to point out that it's your opinion, not necessarily based on facts.  There have been many studies showing the decrease of coordination and response times alone following intoxicating effects of alcohol and many other drugs (both legal and illegal).

The first one is that one of the bills removed the civil fine for possession of up to an ounce. It had been decriminalized before but the fine was still there. Now it's gone.\n\nThe second is that the other bill creates the bureaucracy that will govern the sales of recreational marijuana. That process will probably take two years. So don't expect the opening of any dispensary in Delaware anytime soon.",

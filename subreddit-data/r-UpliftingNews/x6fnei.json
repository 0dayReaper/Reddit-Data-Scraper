It's only functional compared to the rest of the states and developing nations. \n\nSure we have electric trains. But we still have bullshit interconnection issues between all the privately owned rail lines. Cargo constantly takes priority over passengers except in the most populated areas resulting in delays. Getting around NYC is very different from taking a train from NYC to DC or boston, because that involves lines not run by mta.",

They own the rail Boston to Washington DC, Philadelphia to Harrisburg PA, and a couple other segments in Michigan and near New Haven Connecticut.  Because of the shear size of American and the small number of passengers who choose rail for intercity travel most of Amtrak's rail miles are not profitable to operate.  Instead they rely on state, federal and other subsidies along with tickets sales to cover costs.",

Not great but still way more than the 30% of global railway electrification.\n\nThe German Bundesbahn lags way behind in railway infrastructure, no argument there. Partly due to the failed attempt at privatization in the 2000s when it was questioned whether the rails tracks should remain state-owned, so the Bundesbahn had no interest in investing further money into it. And partly due to the fact that Germans love traveling on the Autobahn at 150-200 kmh way more than traveling with trains that are notorious for being unpunctual in Germany. I'm pretty sure if we also had a speed limit of 120 kmh like Sweden (which you probably need to enforce at gunpoint here), that would incentivize more train travels and more investments into railways.",

If the power isn't renewable, then enough power is lost between the split and recombine that it could potentially be better to just burn diesel at the point of consumption. \n\nIf the hydrogen is taken from natural gas or an oil or fracking well, then you've got the associated CO2 emissions, but you're at least making those emissions more efficient, extracting more energy from the same amount of pollution. \n\nIf they split hydrogen using solar, wind, or hydro power, then there's no associated pollution, but it's usually less efficient than generating the power and using the electricity directly.  The whole split/recombine process of hydrogen loses a ton of power.  Transmission through powerlines delivers a lot more of the original generated energy. \n\nHowever..... stored hydrogen energy can be used anywhere, like a less dense form of gasoline, so it would probably be pretty useful in places like the US, where most rail is not electrified.",

In short they're using Silicon as an intermediate step to separate the oxygen and hydrogen. \n\nThey can get Silicon by heating up basically sand (Silicon Dioxide). By heating it up they remove the oxygen. This heating process can be done using a series of lenses to concentrate sunlight to obtain the necessary heat. This method removes the need of solar cells, wind farms, and most importantly fossil fuels. Once they obtain pure silicon, they can add it to water and create Hydrogen, and Silicon Dioxide. \n\nI've simplified a lot of steps but those are the major steps. It's really exciting to see the possibilities of Hydrogen technology!\n\nEdit: Silica-&gt; Silicon",

A nuclear powered electrolysis or catalytic water cracking plant for example. It might not be cheap, and people say there's no infrastructure for it, but what about natural gas lines? If natural gas was phased out over a period of let's say, 20 years, allowing people to retrofit/design and manufacture furnaces that run on hydrogen, it could work.",

That gives 432 million dollars, or 435 million euros. I couldn't find this exact route costs, but [this](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/coradia-ilint-hydrogen-trains/index.html) deal is for 14 trains for 93 million euros. This route in the article only uses 11 I think. So it seems upfront costs would be lower using hydrogen. I don't know how long it would take for electricity to come out ahead. Probably depends a lot on electricity cost and hydrogen costs, as well as the matinance costs of the lines and refiling stations.

We know fuel cells work, they\u2019ve been around for nearly a century. The opposition was because a workable hydrogen infrastructure would have to be completely built out (pipelines, production, etc) while an electric infrastructure already exists. That, and most commercially available hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, with carbon dioxide as a byproduct that is released, so moving to hydrogen wouldn\u2019t do much to reduce carbon emissions. Most of the hydrogen bandwagoning was astroturfed by oil companies.",

All hydrogen that's available for putting into cars and trains was either stripped off of hydrocarbons or off of water (via electrolysis) -- the latter of which is a pretty energy-intensive process.  So, you can view the entire green (water-derived) hydrogen cycle as a giant battery: charged by windmills (pulling it out of water); discharged by cars and trains (reacting it back into water).\n\nEDIT: spelling\n\nEDIT 2: also worth noting that if you see references to 'blue hydrogen' --- this is an industry term for hydrogen stripped from natural gas, which should really be called \"dirty hydrogen\" (as the process dumps all the carbon into the atmosphere).  And, as a responder pointed out, that really is closer to mining hydrogen as a fuel.",

This is why Big Oil REALY wants hydrogen to be a thing and the reason why we should be leery of hydrogen fuel cells. \n\nCurrently its cheaper and more efficinet to produce hydrogen by cracking Natural Gas, rather than cracking water with renewable energy fueled electrolysis. The physics of that just can't be over come.The energy requirements for electrolysis are just too high.\n\nWith hydrogen infrastructure currently as it is, we should just be using the methane for LNG powered trains and shipping. It would save us the energy losses of converting it to hydrogen only to end with CO2 in the atmosphere anyways via steam extraction\n\nThis is one of the big knocks against hydrogen. Are we ACTUALLY gonna push for \"Green Hydrogen\" or are we gonna let the market decide? (AKA let Big Oil continue to have its thumbs in the Energy Sector Pie cause its cheaper?)

And that's one of the reasons I look askance at all hydrogen projects, even though there *could* be real value there.  \n\nIt's what the fossil fuel industry wants.  And I distrust anything that industry is pushing for.\n\nYou can tell it's what they want because the term \"blue hydrogen\" exists --- a term that sounds good and happy and clean and safe, and means essentially \"let's keep burning fossil fuels\".  It should be called \"brown hydrogen\" or \"dirty hydrogen\" or \"petro-hydrogen\".  Blue hydrogen is a plan to market \"green hydrogen\" the same way organic produce is marketed now --- as a slightly more expensive product aimed at liberals who want to feel like they're doing something.\n\nAND, because fuel cell technology has been slow to develop and is still wildly expensive for passenger cars, but is nonetheless being touted as a credible alternative to battery electric.\n\n\n\nThat seems like a calling card for industry greenwashing: \n\n1. Pick something which clearly *could* be good if done in a responsible way, but only in certain specific cases, and only if human nature were fundamentally different.  See: recycling as a justification for massive production of single-use containers.\n2. Showcase it as an alternative to the status quo long before it's anything close to practical (a Toyota Mirai is a $50,000 car that can only use one of about fifty total fueling stations in the country, at which gas is the equivalent of $16/gallon)\n3. Hold up the industry-preferred technology as a viable replacement next to technologies that actually *are* viable and might disrupt the industry (Toyota lobbying to slow BEV adoption)",

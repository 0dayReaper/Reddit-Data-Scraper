            "comment": "The fact that about 20 years ago I remember being in school when someone explained to us, a group of actual children, that if companies had to pay the full true cost of their product, including the cost to clean up and de-pollute the environments they've destroyed that most of the companies would go out of business because the only way they can currently afford to operate is by making the public shoulder the cost of pollution, and nothing was done about it back then is incredible.\n\nWe've known how bad pollution was since the 70s. We've known that it was unsustainable at least since the 90s. We've known that every dollar a company fails to spend to clean or prevent pollution is a dollar or more of burden spent by the public in the form of medical expenses and environmental destruction, and that these companies were effectively getting away with robbery (or worse). And still we got to this point where a handful of rich shitbags have convinced a bunch of rubes that inhaling coal dust is freedom^tm.",

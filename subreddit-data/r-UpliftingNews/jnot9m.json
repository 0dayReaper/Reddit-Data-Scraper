People straight up don't think trans people exist, and you only have to go like 15-20 years back and where I live people thought trans people = transvestite, or someone who alters their body for porn and kinks. Hell, that's what I used to believe. Every trans person I know have been through hell, whether externally or internally but they are resilient, talented, smart, and the kindest and most empathetic people I've ever met. They are certainly more than capable of holding positions of power and public visibility. It's just that the road there comes with so much more resistance than if you're straight/cis/white/male.",

For some it is there entire life their entire identity, social circle, and only thing they ever talk about.  But it\u2019s not for me.  this is my first reddit post even admitting or saying I\u2019m trans cause it has no bearing on any lthjng i post don\u2019t talk about trans anything to anyone. hell all i talk about is weed and music and sewing.  to me it\u2019s a medical issue or defect i am fixing w my doctor. but to some that\u2019s offensive.   the only ones who know that are intimate partners period. It is not a label i want.  i just want to blend in and not be bothered for being trans and i SURE as shit don\u2019t want to be congratulated for (i hate this mantra it grinds my gears it makes my teeth hurt i cringe like nails on a chalk board) \u201cliving my truth\u201d. i literally fucking hate that.  \n\nIdentity is really the wrong word idk.\n\n\nmy two cents.",

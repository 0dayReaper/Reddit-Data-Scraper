That's why companies are desperate to sell solar leases instead of residential panels. Once you sell someone panels, they are more or less set for 20 years (with small amounts of maintenance). You don't have a monopoly on power generation, and you can't profit from massive plant building investments. You're also in a distributed and increasingly competitive (compared to the monopoly utilities are used to) market. Solar is getting so cheap it's going to completely change how utilities work and probably bankrupt more than a few.",

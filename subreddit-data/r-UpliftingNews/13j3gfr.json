(I tried to tell the technician many times that they were clearly doing it wrong but even though they kept recalibrating they couldn't get it right.) This is all to say, the technology is promising but it has a long way to go to be refined, and I really hope science continues along this path because you can only try so many antidepressants that make you deathly ill before you start feeling like giving up.",

It seems pretty clear that the best way to move forward with TMS of any kind would be to somehow automate the process more/remove human error as much as possible, but I'm not a technician and have no idea how feasible that is, only going off my experience and a 20 page research paper I wrote on this which had more to do with the practicality than anything else.",

The new thing about it was the dual-mode part: it could produce both x-ray and electron beams, instead of one or the other. This meant hospitals only needed to purchase a single device. I'd argue the novelty of this was unrelated to the eventual tragedies it caused.\n\nSecond, rather than \"making cancers worse\", it gave patients radiation poisoning, and straight up fatal wounds. These initially appeared as burns, and would then necrose further and further.\n\nThird, I disagree with blaming the machine operators for what occurred. The system had severe engineering and design shortcomings, which is why its being taught about on compsci/compeng courses to this day. The accidents that came of it were not because of a lack of understanding of any underlying physics or biological phenomena (unlike what seems to be the case with the treatment method discussed in the OP). It was a series of serious engineering mistakes.",

If a machine wasn't able to sufficiently surpass a human's capabilities in one way or another, it wouldn't have utility, and thus would never establish a stay.\n\nSo that's kind of not saying much. Where machines aren't better at stuff than humans, they're generally not used either. Kind of a survivorship bias, in a way.\n\nAs for\n\n&gt;Software engineering as a field has learned from this mistake and had thought it to anyone graduating within the last 30 years.\n\nunfortunately, we haven't learned all that much. I deal with concurrency related issues quite often. Medical and military related software may have improved due to formal verification, but in regular business that just isn't deemed viable. These issues are also genuinely hard at their core, and somewhat unsolveable.\n\nSo contemporary systems are still full of very similar issues or worse. It's just that we managed to sort of regulate ourselves out from the worst of it. And even that is sort of questionable, the stories I keep hearing from the automotive and aviation industries isn't super reassuring.",

That and the expense - The first time, TMS wasn't included in the things that Australia's health system would subsidise, and my health fund wouldn't pay for it. Second time, TMS is now included in things that are subsidised, but only if you've never had it before. FML.",

Albeit, I don't remember it being used for depression and depression alone in an otherwise 'healthy' person.\n\nWhat I do know is that TMS machines are used as a treatment method for athletes to help with symptoms stemming from brain injuries. Anxiety and depression being two of the symptoms.\n\nThat said, it's not a fool-proof, one time, treatment. You don't walk in a broken sole and walk out a new person. It requires long-term treatments that don't technically 'fix' the problem. But, again, my minimal knowledge on this is based on those trying to recover from symptoms resulting from a brain injury or TBI... and not depression caused, or rooted in, other factors.\n\nJoe Rogan [had an interesting conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq06mbE23wA) with UFC fighter Cat Zingano on this. Whether you like Joe or not, it's worth a listen.\n\nLong story short - She was suffering with symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, stemming from her fighting. She was prescribed SSRI's to get her at a baseline. But having no 'fight or flight' response during a fight... wasn't working for her. So she started experimenting with TMS treatment and similar 'brain magnet' stim treatments.",

People can and do take classic serotonergic hallucinogens responsibly with positive results, as the substances do have a positive effect on neuroplasticity. 5ht2a receptor sites are upregulated in suicidal patients and substances like LSD and Psilocybin act as partial agonists here effectively downregulating that receptor site in particular. \n\nBad experiences do happen though, and people need to be mindful of when, where and who with they are taking them with. \n\nI must say, though, even with the difficult trips i\u2019ve had, i\u2019ve never once said to myself \u201cwell, let me go do opiates now to deal with this\u201d \nOpiates should be well avoided.",

Depression occurs in \"episodes\" which can reappear even after a remission of symptoms. A good percentage of people never reach full remission, but a more mild state of depression. They learn to cope with it through treatment. TMS is great when it works, but like other treatments it only works for a percentage of those with depression. I think I was told it works for 60-70% of people when I looked into it. It's cost and insurance not wanting to cover it is the biggest reason people don't know more about it.",

He's a well known grifter, who hides behind his PhD to dupe his marks, and who famously personally embraced bad science that nearly killed him. So while the science as published may be valid and ethical, a person discussing it isn't automatically either of those things. \"Good science\" is constantly being misrepresented by bad actors.",

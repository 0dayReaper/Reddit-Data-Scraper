So, I decided to draw what the screen looks like on the blackboard with chalk.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI have been doing this every time the lesson I\u2019m teaching demands it,\u201d Akoto continued. \u201cI\u2019ve drawn monitors, system units, keyboards, a mouse, a formatting toolbar, a drawing toolbar, and so on. The students were okay with that. They are used to me doing everything on the board for them.\u201d*\n\nGood for this guy. It really shows how dedicated to the students he is.",

I didn\u2019t have a projector, used the whole department budget for the year to order one, and now I have to wait for the IT department to approve and send long enough cords to plug the projector to the computer and be able to project across the room onto another wall, to a visible location. They also told me to hook it up and trouble shoot it myself. \n\nI am grateful my students have computer labs to use with their homeroom teachers. But the situations in American public schools are unbelievable. I\u2019ve had people hesitate to believe me when I told them my computer barely works and I had no projector. (Neighboring schools had entire hallways without power for 2-3 weeks earlier this year. Teaching in a Title I school with greater than 80% free lunch is a very different experience from many Americans\u2019 idea of school.)",

So even though most of the things on the computer are very similar, they just don't see the link between them. They just don't see why they know how to do A and they can apply a similar idea to do B also. I thought that's the basic skill of an engineer, but no... ",

I work in a pretty big tech company, and I can honestly say that most of the company is comprised of \"digital natives\" - for example, I was having a problem with my laptop and our helpdesk sent back the ticket with an answer that was, in essence, \"Open Regedit, and change these keys to these values, that should work\" and that's exactly what I did.\n\nI use (unwillingly) Snapchat to connect with my kids.  Our basement computer, connected to a projector, runs Linux. I enjoy messing with a Raspberry Pi for no particular reason. So, yeah, I'm a digital native. \n\nBut OMFG - when I step outside our world - to clients, to my local community - it's a shitshow of willfull technological ignorance. \n\nTrue story: \nI'm a leader/member of a community organization. We all have email addresses associated with the organization. \nLast night at a meeting at a building where the organization headquarters is located, I gave that email address to someone (my age, nearly exactly) attending, and told them to send me something related to an upcoming event. \n\nThey said, \"Will you be here tomorrow to check your email?\"\nI didn't understand. \nI replied,  \"I don't have to be anywhere in particular to get my email - I get it on my phone, my laptops, whatever...\" \nThey answered, \"Wow, you're really a 'techie' Well I'm not in my office tomorrow, so I won't be able to email you anything until Monday.\" \nMe: (\u2299_\u2609) \n\n\n\n\n\n",

When I came back he was still staring at the same basic spreadsheet with a blank look on his face.  Turns out the document owner had locked the first few columns so the headers would scroll with the data.  This was done to make the data easier to read, but it was just unfamiliar enough that it caused his brain to go into a bootloop.  He was just starting at the sheet trying to make sense of it and he was just waiting for me to get back to explain it to him. \n\nThis may sound callous, but I've had more than one boss ask me to \"show them\" how to do something in Excel.  I would always grab the keyboard and mouse and do it myself.  They were never going to credit my efforts, so I'm not about to hand them a skillset.  Most of the time I have to try a few different things to remember how to do what they're asking anyways. ",

This sort of this has been taught since the 80s and in this exact fashion and just not with mS Word. Imagine having whole TEST on having to open up the various application (cmdline, chess, mS Word, Photoshop, the internet) without ever seeing a real computer or taking your 90 person class on a field trip to see 1-3 computers. Just imagine that.\n\n\nOh, and if you think you can just say \"use mouse then use LMB to click this\" that wouldn't work. You'd probably be lucky to have ever used a mouse (1980s). No, you'd have to open all applications using shortkeys. You'd use shortkeys in mSWord. You'd d create tables, underline words, change font, etc. \n\n\nOnly benefit is that you'd come out knowing how to use a computer MUCH better than an American, but without practice on an actual computer or keyboard it would be akward when finally getting to use one. By the time my mother and uncle regualrly saw computers they had forgotten what they had learned.",

Do regular Ghanaians see things improving? ",

With investment in real estates and other technological avenues, it's still a challenge for the normal working Ghanaian to see the improvement in their personal lives. The salaries paid to workers are way way inadequate to allow them to purchase homes. This is coupled with high interest rates. \nThe problem with salaries is both ways: govenment (and other private business owners) pretend to pay, so workers also pretend to work. Therefore, there's low productivity and the government uses this as excuse to pay more. As of now, the median monthly salary for Teachers with University degree is about GHS 1,300.00 (about USD 294.28). So our situation is convulated",

In higher crime areas they might add an alarm. You're right that it does have to be addressed on some level, though. I'm sure the school knows that. Where they get the funding if they have to put security windows and doors is another question.",

I've been working with non-profits in the developing world for 10 years installing computer labs in underserved schools.\n\nPeople often don't realize how much more than computer hardware takes. I've seen donated computers at schools without electricity. Without desks. Or computers riddled with viruses because nobody installed or updated the anti-virus software. I've gone to deep rural schools and found upscale labs with full networking, a server and laser printers, but nobody has the password and nobody knows who to call. And of course if the computers are actually put to good use, they only last a couple years under school conditions.\n\nWhat's my point? There is more to addressing this this than just getting computers. I'm sure this teacher are thrilled, but I hope that whoever organized this, or someone else, has a longer term plan to assist, guide, and maintain, or it's not going to have much impact. I wish them much luck.\n\nFWIW, I'm going to see if we have people in Ghana that can connect. Our main thing is [putting online educational content into offline communities](https://worldpossible.org/), but it's worth looking into.\n\nNonetheless, stay uplifted!",

We are working with local teachers and trying to promote an online professional development platform.\n\nIn a few weeks we will go meet this awesome dude and visit his school, and we are all very excited.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one who has to do this though. We\u2019ve visited a few schools so far and all the teachers we\u2019ve met have complained about not having proper materials. If the students need to do individual work, the teachers often have to write out the entire page from the textbook on the blackboard. Just a few days ago I watched a grade 3 teacher trying to teach her kids how to tell time without any actual clocks.\n\nSo this is great, but it is not an isolated incident. West African teachers need as much support as they can get!",

Now your body can go about 3 weeks without food so after running out they would've just gotten hungry. Now the part I'm not sure on is how much water they had since you can only go about 3 days without it. My guess which is just speculation is they would have had to drink cave water. All the possible diseases you could get from that are a terrible thought although given the choice of that or death by dehydration it seems logical to me that they must have to survive 10 days. Or the coach had enough water to keep them all alive that long but that's unlikely for a trip that wasn't planned to be overnight.",

This makes it possible for the boys to walk out through a lot of the cave, but there are still about 1km of diving that has to happen.\n\nSeems they decided it was best to get them out quickly while their pumping has been successful before more water comes in. It seems to have been the right decision, because if the worst were to happen for whatever reason and the rest of the team can't get out, they've still saved 8 of them already. \n\nI call even that a huge success, but I'm very hopeful that the rest will get out successfully as well. Seems they have a solid system in place to get them out successfully!",

These boys were weak and malnourished and didn't know how to swim a week ago. \n\nThe boys have one diver in front guiding them and holding their tank and one diver behind. Through pitch dark passages with as little as 15 inches of space. The biggest fear was that these kids would panic and drown not only themselves but possibly their diver. Huge props to everyone involved. It's been amazing to see everyone from across the world come together. ",

If a diver gets disoriented enough and loses the guide line, it is conceivable that they could get lost in there until the oxygen runs out. \n\nIf a diver panics, they could try to rip their mask off or knock someone else\u2019s off (although one of the most basic things a diver learns is how to retrieve their regulator (the breathing apparatus) if it gets knocked out of their mouth). \n\nAlso, the rocks are hard, possibly jagged, and with poor visibility, it is possible to ram into something hard enough to get injured. The likelihood increases with decreasing visibility (more flood water, struggling resulting in more silt and mud being kicked up), faster currents, and a panicking passenger who could be flailing about desperately. \n\nAnd finally, there are all sorts of lines floating around\u2014the guide line, air hoses to the regulators, and various tethers. Getting disoriented and spinning around could result in getting tangled up in the various lines, which could prevent breathing or prevent them from exiting the submerged area. And with such poor visibility, you couldn\u2019t even begin to untangle yourself. ",

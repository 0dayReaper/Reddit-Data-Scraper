Teachers have learned through years of tornado drills that students should be kept under their desks, quiet, and to wait for instructions. This is why 12 out of the students killed in Columbine were killed in the library. The librarian told them to quietly hide under their desks where they were promptly executed. It's not her fault, she was only doing what she knew in a desperate situation. \n\nUnfortunately, 90% of the students in the first room at the Virginia Tech massacre were killed because they attempted to hide under their desks when the murderer started shooting. The following rooms attempted to deny entry of the killer by barricading the door. The subsequent rooms he shot had less casualties as people attempted to deny entry. Even with failed denial, the death rates were lower in the rooms that people tried to deny or defend. The last room had no casualties because the students laid on the floor foot to shoulder and blocked the door. The killer fired through the door but didn't shoot low enough, and couldn't open the braced door. There were no injuries or casualties in that room. \n\n1. **Avoid** the shooter. Run. Scream. Windows, doors, exits. A 15 foot drop and a broken leg is better than sitting under your desk waiting for your turn to be executed by a coward.\n\n2. If you cannot avoid the shooter, **DENY** the shooter access. Barricade doors with chairs, desks, other heavy objects. Whatever is near. Make it difficult for the shooter to reach you. Remember, police response time has been on average 3 minutes from the initial call. The vast majority of active shooter events have taken place in 3 minutes or less. If you can prolong the time it takes for the shooter to reach you or other victims, you are a hero simply by hiding.\n\n3. If you cannot avoid the shooter and you absolutely cannot deny, then **DEFEND** yourself against the shooter. Position yourself advantageously against the shooter if you hear the direction they are coming from. Prepare to attack from the sides or behind. The weapon is your target. If you cannot avoid or deny, do not allow that shooter to take your precious life with that gun. They have no right to take your life. Get angry. Close the distance to the shooter as quickly as possible. Incite groups of potential victims i.e. \"He's going to kill us! Get him!\" to attack the shooter and quickly grab control of the slide of the gun (if a handgun) if the slide cannot reset, the weapon cannot be fired again. Without a gun, the shooter is worthless. The power is the gun, not the shooter. Get the gun, get the power. Keep in mind, this is your last resort. Only defend if you cannot escape or deny the shooter access to you.\n\nhttp://www.avoiddenydefend.org/",

Yes these events are terrible, and strike at the most vulnerable parts of our society. But they are ultimately part of a much larger problem. Even if Parkland was the last school or mass shooting we ever see, you\u2019d still have tens of thousands of violent gun deaths in our country every year. These events don\u2019t make a dent in the overall problem. And I can\u2019t help but think that until we look at the entire thing holistically - not just every time a flashy snapshot forces it\u2019s way into the news cycle - it will continue.\n\nThe mindset that this is a war on children, or schools, or whatever will only lead the stopgap. Ban the AR15 and you still have Virginia Tech (let alone more absurd suggestions like arming teachers). Focusing so much on these events will do nothing to solve the overall gun and violence problem. The solutions that may seem obvious based on the specifics of this event, or the bump stock in Vegas, or whatever, won\u2019t do much to actually save lives overall. We need to work towards significantly decreasing the 30,000+ gun deaths in our country every year (about half of those murders), not the ~200 who die to mass shootings. However hard it may be.",

The fire was caused by pyrotechnics set off by the tour manager of the evening's headlining band Great White, which ignited plastic foam used as sound insulation in the walls and ceilings surrounding the stage. A fast-moving fire with intense black smoke engulfed the club in 5\u00bd minutes. Video footage of the fire shows its ignition, rapid growth, the billowing smoke that quickly made escape impossible, and the exit blockage that further hindered evacuation.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Peter Wang was certainly a hero, but all I can imagine is what his parents are going through right now. \n\nThey immigrated from China, and I can only imagine their reason for immigrating was to have a better life for their family. This is the dream that almost everyone who chooses to leave their home for a new country has, so I would guess this family is no exception. \n\nSince I\u2019ve heard no mention of Peter Wang having any siblings, I imagine also that he is an only child. (Since he was born in China during the one child policy, I think this is a fair assumption.) So then he was not only an only child, but the oldest and only son - a hugely important role in Chinese culture. Who is going to take care of his parents when they grow old? \n\nThis all happened on the eve of Chinese New Year, which is the biggest holiday of the year for Chinese people. Imagine if this whole incident had happened on Christmas Eve, what an extra agony this would have been for the rest of the parents. Losing a child is horrific no matter what time of year it happens, but having it right before a major celebration just adds an extra layer of tragedy. \n\nThis kid is rightfully being celebrated as a hero,  but I don\u2019t know how much consolation that is for his parents who had so many hopes and dreams for him.\n\nThese parents chose to leave behind their home and country so that their son could have a brighter future with more opportunities. \n\nAnd it turns out that the only opportunity America brought him is the opportunity to die for his country.

Showed his pic on the court date maybe twice. Otherwise, all the coverage -and it\u2019s extensive- is about the students and the activism and everyone\u2019s efforts in the wake of it all to fight for change. It\u2019s been heartbreaking in both bad and good ways. I tear up every time they talk about the kids who died and show the other students speaking about what happened.  It\u2019s sad that the movement has to happen at all, but so amazing to see everyone coming together and all these young people so committed and determined. I\u2019m not American but I\u2019m so proud of all those kids. And I\u2019m proud of the parents and teachers who are encouraging and supporting them. I\u2019m the rear view mirror we can still see the days when young people were easily dismissed, and here we are today, with all these courageous kids leading the good fight. I\u2019m sorry it had to happen, but these kids are doing a great job of playing the hand they\u2019ve been dealt. ",

He died wearing his Junior ROTC shirt, died doing what he believed was right, because he saw beyond himself. Peter Wang dreamed, and realised things about the fragility and precious nature of life that so few ever see. And now by the merit of that same fragility he is gone and his dreams are gone. I have the upmost respect for the US Military Academy for the way they treated the situation: by them, no greater honour could have been given to Peter. I hope they are proud of their son, for the incredible and selfless action he took, but no amount of pride, and no medal any army can award, can bring their son back. He will never see that medal, never go to the training academy, never again fight for what he believes in. Peter Wang knew a bravery few of us ever see, a bravery I dearly hope neither you nor I will ever have to know or see, so please let\u2019s celebrate that but let\u2019s also not forget the horror of what just has happened, because let me assure you neither his parents nor the friends he saved ever will. I\u2019m not here to talk to you about gun laws or terrorism, or tell you what to do or ask you to sign something. I\u2019m just here to beg that as a society we never forget what has happened here, because both Peter\u2019s bravery and Peter\u2019s tragedy need to be remembered. I beg that we do not let this happen again, as a boy just older than Peter who sees in the smile on the picture on his memorial everything I could ever want in a friend; everything a parent could ever ask for in a child and everything we could ask for in a young man. Honour Peter, and let the gratitude for what he did stay with us forever, but please never let any fifteen year old boy make that sacrifice again.",

We\u2019re all human beings and we all experience emotion. Maybe if the shooter was more in touch with his emotions, he could\u2019ve gotten help. \n\nAlso, this isn\u2019t meant to be a stab at you...more a stab at how our society has trained us to _not_ pay attention to our emotions, and writing this is my small way of trying to contribute to a better, more peaceful and happy society.

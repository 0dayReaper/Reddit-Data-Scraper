So 82% FAKE is a bit of a stretch, although lots of manufacturers are having trouble preventing oxidation.  Looked further and avocado oil has some of the worst oxidative stability of the common food oils -- although surprisingly on par with canola, didn't realize how easy canola is to go rancid.\n\nSo, buy the bottle with the furthest away expiration date, and from a brand you trust, if possible.\n\nMixed/adulterated oil only comprised 27% of tested oils. With one of those six being entirely a different oil! \n\nYay deregulation!  ...",

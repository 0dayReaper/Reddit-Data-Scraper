In the spirit of this post and uplifting even more, there is an international group called Best Buddies that focuses specifically on befriending and including people with disabilities in schools. There are chapters in many high schools. If you ever need confidence that this world is going to be inherited by good, responsible, caring people, go meet a few Best Buddies participants.  \nhttps://www.bestbuddies.org/",

Went to parties. Was well liked. Looked cool. He was also a flat out bully. One day a member of administration decided that instead of detention, my brother would serve the Best Buddies club/ special needs classroom. He was extremely upset at first and lashed out, but one day, he was great friends with everyone in Best Buddies, and other football players had joined, thinking my brother did it on his own free will. The next year, my brother joined willingly and didn't bully anyone. He stopped his ways. He needed a positive outlet. It's almost 18 years later, and our school still runs the program. His best buddy works at a local retail outlet near my brother and he still drops by to have a good time.",

We had a great time together those last couple of years in school.\n\nThe first couple of weeks hanging out some cruel kids would still yell \"ribbit\" at him. I would immediately walk up to them and ask if they wanted the be known as the guy who makes fun of mentally disabled kids. I was in the popular clique and that threat would work right away with everyone.

I'm sure they would have been proud to call themselves someone who bully mentally disabled people. In fact, they were, we had someone with some sort of IQ problem in our class. They constantly beat the shit out of him. When we were 16, the bullied girls got fed up with it, me among them, and we'd stand up for him. Not the popular girls though. They didn't care.\n\nI spent DECADES thinking that only bullies can be appreciated and popular. I am so glad every time I hear things like your comment, that it's not always like this.\n\nBy the way, all those popular bullies, I don't know about all of them, but last time I heard nobody talked to anybody else. Most of them emigrated or are working dead end jobs. The bullied mentally challenged kid now works in military defense and is doing a brilliant job. I am still in contact with him on social media. He is always smiling, as he was, and seems to be doing great. Neither he nor we others care to hear what happened to the bullies. This bit is for those who want closure on this kind of situation. School ends. It DOES end. And then the world doesn't always work how they imagined it.",

It\u2019s really hard because when they were babies they would interact all the time until their regression. They have their moments - I have a few video clips of them interacting or hugging but it\u2019s brief and then doesn\u2019t happen again for a long time. I\u2019m hoping it will improve, they are making great progress generally in their own time.",

Christian has Down syndrome, and his mom, Donna Herter, said his lack of friends was making him feel depressed. \n\n\"\\[He was\\] just constantly asking where his friends are, why doesn't anybody want to come over and spend some time with him,\" Herter, who lives near Rochester, Minnesota, told CBS News. \"We would go to Walmart or the store and he would invite half the store to come home with us and play video games with us. And of course, nobody would. And he just doesn't understand why.\"\n\nHerter didn't know where to turn. So, she posted on Facebook. \"I just basically said that I was looking for a young man, between the ages of 20 and 28, local,\" she said. \"I told them that I'd pay them $80 for two hours to basically just hang out and play video games with him. All he really wants is just a guy friend to do guy stuff with.\"\n\nHerter is a nurse, working the overnight shift. She sent the post at 4 a.m. before ending her workday. And when she woke up, it had about 5,000 comments.\n\n\"I was freaking out. My hands were shaking, I was sweating. I was just looking for some local guys, I didn't want to invite like the entire world into our house,\" she said. She was overwhelmed and thought about deleting the post \u2013 but a friend told her to look at the replies first. \n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/christian-bowers-down-syndrome-friends-mom-donna-herter-facebook/",

She's allowed to go to my old high school until she's 22, which is 2 more years. I worry so much about what she's going to do after. My parents have no plans that bring comfort or relieve the worry &amp; I'm not at the point in my life yet where providing significant financial support is sustainable ... sigh",

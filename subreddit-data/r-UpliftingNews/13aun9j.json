The condition occurs when a vein connects with an artery in the brain. These two types of vessels have different functions and should be kept separate\u2014arteries ferry high-pressure flows of oxygenated blood from the heart, while thin-walled veins carry low-pressure blood back the other way.\"\n\n&gt;\"When the two combine, the high-pressure blood flow from an artery can stretch the thin walls of the vein. \u201cOver time the vein essentially blows up like a balloon,\u201d says Darren Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts, who treats babies born with the condition\n\n&gt;Doctors then used ultrasound imaging to help them guide a needle through the mother\u2019s abdomen, the uterus wall, and the fetus\u2019s skull and into the malformation in the brain. Members of the team fed a tiny catheter through the needle to deliver a series of tiny platinum coils into the blood-filled pocket. Once each was released, it expanded, helping to block the point where the artery joined the vein.\"\n\nFucking insane how far medicine has come.",

I.e. prostate extractions can be done with it and it has a documented benefit for this operation for the patient regarding nerve sparing.\n\nThis robotic system is not used for operations on fetuses (yet). The trocars which are the entry way for the instruments are too big in systems like the DaVinci for accessing the fetus - you want to make as small incisions as possible to contain the amniotic fluid to carry the fetus as long as possible. This operation shown requires an astounding control of catheters with which the connection between artery and vein was accessed.\n\nEdit: spelling",

He made a mini CNC machine; basically, a drill that moves on a surface, and, well, drills materials. Using lasers for measuring distances and when operating inside the parameters set in the computer that controlled the thing, the drill had a reliable precision until the 1/2 of a milimeter mark. He wanted to make it more precise, because he had a 0.1mm drill bit and he wanted to use it. \n\nHe achieved that level of precision with electric motors he got from a printer and some microprocontrollers (cheap mini-computers), and a bunch of other stuff to interface all that with a program he made in his laptop.\n\nIf an electronics major can do that, imagine the level of precision a team of engineers with experience could achieve when designing tools for clinical applications, in wich precision is critical.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the tools they used for the surgery had precisions close to the \u00b10.01mm mark, or less than that even.

Once the shock/awe/wonder wears off and you take a look behind the curtain you see just how damned *ingenious* it is and now the sense of awe/wonder is more about how someone came up with that idea, how the figured it out, and how they polished it to make it look so easy and natural.\n\nAt least for me, that is better than the magic trick and why I\u2019ve never agreed with the magicians code. For me, knowing how the trick was done does not diminish my admiration or respect for the trick and in many cases, increases my appreciation.",

Among the fetal imaging we do\u2014ultrasound, MRI, echocardiogram\u2014we can find most structural anomalies, especially if a later ultrasound is performed for some reason (not always done.)

Basically don't die in child birth and keep up a physically active lifestyle on your farm and you would have a long life. \n\nIt was attributed to the isolation of the town that communicable diseases rarely made it that far inland; the journey on foot or even horseback on the primitive trails took so long the carriers died first. The town had some of the best farmland around so the residents didn't have to struggle to grow crops, so while their may not have been much trade it was also not really subsistence level farming struggling to avoid starvation and malnutrition. No industrial pollutants, and I suspect tobacco wasn't particularly popular yet.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, there was enough contact with outside communities that life spans dropped precipitously.",

I was one of the first who had the hole patched by catheterization instead of open heart surgery. \n\nEarlier than 50 years ago I probably would have died or would have been severely disabled. Even heart surgery would have been risky because I have clot issues that helped cause the stroke. Heparin makes me clot which we discovered after my hysterectomy when I developed a clot in my incision the size of a beef\u2019s liver (no exaggeration). \n\nI also hemorrhaged after the resident insisted on giving me toradol despite my hematologist\u2019s warning letter. I was on so much pain, and he refused to give me any more pain medication until I tried the toradol. I had to have a blood transfusion, and my heart rate went up to 180bpm and wouldn\u2019t come down for 12 hours. I had two crash carts in my room because the nurses were afraid I\u2019d go into cardiac arrest. I was in some sort of step down ICU and was heavily monitored.\n\nI had to get a bubble study done the next day to make sure the patch in my heart hadn\u2019t moved or had holes in it from all the extra pressure put on it from my high tachycardia. A bubble study is an echogram of the heart while they inject thousands of super tiny air bubbles into your vein. Then they watch the bubbles on the echo to see if any go across the patched hole. I get thick scarring so mine is textbook perfect according to them. \n\nThe bubbles pose no danger and feel like effervescent beverage bubbles when they go through your head. It\u2019s weird in a pleasant way so I let them do the study multiple times so anyone in the department can come look to see what the study should look like. Everyone always wants to see it. \n\nI had the catheterization done at a teaching hospital and my assigned medical student asked if she could watch. She was amazing and explained everything going on to me and my family. She printed off information from the medical library for us. I was happy for her to watch and invited her to see if anyone else wanted to watch with the cardio surgeon\u2019s blessing. The room was packed. I only asked that they let me watch too. I was drugged up and feeling no pain. It was really cool to watch. \n\nThe patch is made of wire gortex and looks like two folded up umbrellas &lt;\u2014&gt; then when it\u2019s in the right place the patch is opened {\u2014}. Scar tissue forms over the hole and blocks it off completely. Although some viruses and high blood pressure can affect the patch. \n\nAny other time in history I would have died. If not from my heart and strokes, but definitely from the uterine cancer I wouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid by getting tested for precancerous cells. Pregnancy and childbirth with my heart would have also probably killed me.",

The parents had to be extremely lucky to be in the right place at the right time with the right diagnosis. \n\nIf this was in Texas, Tennessee, Idaho, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, Florida, Wyoming, Arkansas, etc, the baby would be dead. No doctor in any of those states would be willing to conduct such a surgery and be accused of murder if it didn't go well.

Citing an outlier is deceptive because for every case like your neice, there are 100,000 babies who died. \n\nIf anyone here is considering raising a disabled child: you should absolutely NOT keep a fetus that only has a brainstem unless you're wealthy and have full time to devote to this child. A child with such a severe disability need either a 24/7 care from you, your spouse, and all of your other children, or $150,000/year for a full time/live in nurse. That's on top of 6 figure medical costs. \n\nNow, I realize you have ulterior (religious) motives for trying to paint such a severe disability in a positive light, but lying about the survival odds and family quality-of-life of child with holoprosencephaly is scummy. If parents get the holoprosencephaly diagnosis at their 30 week ultrasound, the best course of action is to abort and try again.",

My husband and I are the youngest in our families and made the decision that if testing showed our child would have had special needs that would require intensive help then we would abort. It sucks but financially we couldn't have done it and a special needs child is more then a life time commitment. Thankfully our daughter was mostly fine except for what is now a minor speech delay. The disease you describe is definitely one that should be aborted and I suspect the Dr said as much because the vast majority will die very quickly and don't really have much of a life.",

Soon-to-be parents who have went through 30 weeks of pregnancy would usually do anything possible for their baby to survive. This case shows exactly that. This woman went into an experimental surgery in her (and possibly her partner's) desperate hope to save the baby and give it a good life. If someone is trying to have a baby and it is descovered that their baby has a condition that would doom it into living a severely disabled life in the edge of existing or won't be able to survive past birth, it is very far from just a \"choice\" to have an abortion. Such an experience is traumatic and very hard to go through. And for many of those people the \"choice\" is an abortion or seeing their baby die in their hands minutes after caring it to term. How can someone dare judge such people from their high horse of not having to deal with a hardship like that, and calling them names or meddling with their lives, it beyond me.",

If the child would be born to a debilitating, painful, or low quality of life condition, you have no right to force that on a child or a family because you feel a certain way about it.  If the pregnancy is not viable, there is no reason women should be forced to naturally miscarry putting their health at greater and greater risk.  \n\nYour barbaric policies are killing people and driving physicians/nurses out of states that pass these laws.

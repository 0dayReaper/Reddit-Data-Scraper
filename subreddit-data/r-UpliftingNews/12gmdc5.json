I don't think that there are UC Berkeley economics professors who are going to be taken in context at Time. It's a complex issue that's being pushed as click bait propaganda.\n\nWorking class income gap is not where the inequality comes from. It's from the owners class. \n\nRegardless the way that the upper class messes with their perceived wealth through irrelevant incomes is the point here.\n\nMost of the richest people in the world make their money here and are not even paying any income tax at all. Their companies are holding the wealth and sending it over seas.\n\nThe wealth gap is humongous and statistics like these being used to deflate the real issues of the wealth gap argument are just silly. Acquiring stock or dividends outside of the USA is not included as income. What about the oil and energy company profits just this last quarter.\n\nUsing income instead of accounting for wealth and corporate welfare just don't even begin to make a profile for the issue. The people who have actual wealth and power consider themselves global citizens and are not even counted in these lists.\n\nBut whatever. I just can't even start to try to talk about this right now. It's too depressing and trying to be talked down to by someone who clearly defends the status quo is just disheartening at this point.\n\nWhy don't you just consider that the rise of the number of billionaires from 300 to 400 versus the increase of the number of human beings being forced into poverty than continue spuing this kind of pseudo economic bullcrap to say things are getting better during an economic collapse designed to increase the wealth gap and bring poverty to even more people.\n\nYeah things are not as bad as it looks and only getting better argument has tons of money and power invested into it and is absolute propaganda.

It's become more of a global owner class issue than just the United States. I would say that the way the corporations and countries collude with each other to make the wealth gap as wide as it has become needs to take into account actual quality of life issues. Wealth is not just coin but societal wealth as well. The fact of pollution being dumped, and social services being dissolved and privatized is a form of wealth tax. The list goes on and on. So what if we have a bunch more money in the already inflated system when we have basically lost all of our infrastructure, education, and basic civil rights while we are getting ripped apart by terrible hurricanes and acid rain storms. While the Saudi prince enjoys parties on his stratospheric space station with Putin and Thiel and Bezos. It just doesn't reflect the real wealth gap. It is larger than it has ever been in history and it is true even in the US if you just add the total value of the largest corporations to their board members wealth. We cannot allow these people to continue to hide behind their bogus corporate persons loop holes they love so much.\n\nThis is an owner's class issue. Working class are so far out of control it's not even relevant and our quality of life is becoming less and less dependant on our income as time progresses.",

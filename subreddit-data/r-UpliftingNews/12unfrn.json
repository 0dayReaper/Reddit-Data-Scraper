From your article: \"Over the last five years, there were at least 4,780 adolescents who started on puberty blockers and had a prior gender dysphoria diagnosis.\" About 5,000 kids across 5 years. There are 73 million kids in America: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/adult-and-under-the-age-of-18-populations-2020-census.html So 1 in 14,600 kids were treated with puberty blockers over the last 5 years. So .006%.\n\nAgain, from your article: \"Without puberty blockers, the physical changes [of puberty] can cause severe distress in many transgender children. If an adolescent stops the medication, puberty resumes.\" Puberty blockers are largely reversible. From the Mayo Clinic: \"If an adolescent child decides to stop taking GnRH analogues, puberty will resume and the normal progression of the physical and emotional changes of puberty will continue... Children may have their height checked every three months. Bone density is also checked periodically. If bone growth or density is a concern, your child's health care provider might prescribe a different medication, stop treatment with GnRH analogues or recommend the best time to start cross-hormone therapy.\" https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075\n\nYour article: \"The ultimate step in gender-affirming medical treatment is surgery, which is uncommon in patients under age 18... The Komodo analysis of insurance claims found 56 genital surgeries among patients ages 13 to 17 with a prior gender dysphoria diagnosis from 2019 to 2021. Among teens, \u201ctop surgery\u201d to remove breasts is more common. In the three years ending in 2021, at least 776 mastectomies were performed in the United States on patients ages 13 to 17 with a gender dysphoria diagnosis, according to Komodo\u2019s data analysis of insurance claims. This tally does not include procedures that were paid for out of pocket.\"\n\nTo take the larger number, 776 into 73,000,000 is 1 in 94,072, or .001%. I would imagine those are cases where the risk of NOT performing surgery was clearly greater than the potential risk of performing it. These decisions are not made lightly, nor are they forced on children.\n\nThe bottom line being, surgery on transgender adolescents is exceedingly rare. And while a case can be made that such surgeries should not be performed before the age of 18, the fact is that politicians are also attempting to attack reversible treatments like puberty blockers. By and large, treatment for gender dysphoria in adolescents is done to manage puberty and get the child to the age of 18 where they can make their own decisions about their bodies and potentially more permanent steps like surgery.\n\nGender-affirming surgeries are not something that doctors \"force\" on children, they're seen as a necessary treatment for gender dysphoria when all other options have been exhausted. And, again, they're very rare. The idea that this is some massive plague and that Democrats are \"coming to get your kids\" is a fabrication.",

We know that surgeries are NOT performed on children, but on informed legal adults after a lot of consideration, not like the claims conservatives have fabricated. We know that puberty blockers are SAFE, we know that suicide rates virtually vanish for trans people the moment they recieve social support and medical care, and we know that surgeries for trans people have an astronomically high sucess and satisfaction rate, also long term.  \n\nRational, science based and compassionate laws for the win! :)",

This will reflect light back into space. It also helps indirectly by lowering the temperature of the city so people can turn down their ACs. It is definitely one of the solutions we should be pursuing, especially since it is easily politically achievable.",

Now, East coast is pretty tightly gathered, they could do mass transit well.  Central and western US?  Super spread out, mass transit outside of dense population centers becomes a huge budget drain.  And as a resident in the midwest, I so, SO wish that wasn't the case.  I would LOVE to be able to hop on a train to my Capitol and visit some shit they have there, but that's not an option.\n\nInstead, we drive two hours with the freedom to leave whenever we want and drive two hours back, or we take a bus that only comes to our town once every twelve hours, and be stuck there until the next bus.\n\nAnd if we did rail, it'd be all new line going to a place which would need a new station, and would need to have a train come in more frequently than the bus to be worth it to people, but it still wouldn't offer the same freedom of mobility and time departure a personal car offers.",

Not sure if they still do; I haven't used the 417 in a couple years. But there'd be strips of road that were all different and uh at one point they were damaged enough that it became a bumpy ride lol (months later they were doing road work to fix it and lawd the traffic). Think at some point they were also testing road paints, too.",

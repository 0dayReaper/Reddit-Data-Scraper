I looked left and right and then gassed my car like I never have before and drove away. This was in upstate NY and I was literally 18 and many grown-ass men and women were swarming my vehicle. This was at 8:30 am and I was literally the only car there. I can't believe these people, they need to get a life, and no one even got an abortion.\n\nedit: bad grammar",

The vile slurs and accusations they had to endure was insane. More than once we had a girl break down in the street. The one that broke me was \"I was r\\*ped by my dad, what do you want me to do?\". You think the protesters would back off...nope. I near went to prison that day.\n\nAfter the girls had gone in, if any of them got up in my face about it, my question was always: And how many of the \"you could just put them up for adoption\" babies have you adopted and are looking after? None? I see, so you are just an asshole.\n\nGood on ya Spain. 100% support this!",

As stated above; they are basically also abusing pregnant women who are carrying to term and want their kids with their bullshit outside legitimate healthcare facilities.  These are the same people that vote against any help for mothers; i have found they do not overlap with any meaningful position in society, they are basically religious homeless people.  You wont find this type of person volunteering at orphanages or soup kitchens; you know, to address the problem that affects them apparently so deeply.  Instead they use their time (life currency) to judge and shit on people they dont know.  I work in healthcare; and what ive heard some of them say flippantly to people waiting at the bus stop makes me wish they were Soylent Green and at least useful.",

The first is simple a protest cant block highways or firefighters or hospitals doing their job. The second is securing protests with enough cops to prevent escalation by protesters agianst other people and protect the protesters agianst counterprotesting and guiding them so not too much go into busy shopping malls. Altering the plan is usually changing the place and time. So firefighters, medics, funerals. embassies and businesses still can do their thing.",

Because Texas is just awful at the medical level and they outlawed abortion and passed other accompanying ridiculous laws. People can sue you and jail you for having an alleged abortion now. Also since Texas has laws that limit malpractice payouts, a lot of shitty doctors end up there so their mistakes are capped at a low financial cost. I sighed a great sigh of relief when I heard she picked New Zealand. Y'all gained a good doctor. Even conservative and religious doctors, if they don't ignore their oath, they know no question that abortion is healthcare and medically necessary and always will be.",

Side-stepping the whole point of them not funding children's programs, etc. They only care to bring the \"innocent child\" to term.\n\nPro-death penalty means that a person was convicted of a crime and is no longer innocent. Again, side stepping the fact that death penalty is woefully biased toward people of color and that it is nowhere near perfect in terms of convictions.  They only care to see criminals punished.\n\nDon't get me wrong: they are still hypocrites but not because they are both pro life and pro death penalty.",

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\"\n\nMethodist Pastor David Barnhart",

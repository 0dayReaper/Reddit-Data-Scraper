And the lifespan of the whole country for President and SCOTUS. \n\nSomething like \"President can be sworn in at a max of 5 years below the Average lifespan age of the country. Senators must retire when they hit 10 years below the average lifespan of their State. Congressmen can't run for reelection once they hit 15 years below the average lifespan of their State. Justices must retire 2 years before the average lifespan of the country\" \n\nThat sort of thing. That way older communities in the next generations that live longer still have the opportunity to elect someone their age that represents them. I also think it would motivate Congress to pass better healthcare legislation.",

We value professors, doctors, managers, electricians, etc. with years, or even decades of experience because it means they're more likely to be really good at what they do.  Why wouldn't we want the people making laws for our very large, very complex society to have extensive experience?  \n\nIt's true that, in some areas, younger minds may have better ideas, especially when it comes to cutting edge ideas or technology, though this isn't always the case.  We laugh when Congress struggles to understand social media platforms.  But then someone like Bernie Sanders comes up and riles up a bunch of youngins by understanding their needs, and what would provide them with better equality of opportunity.\n\nBasically, it's a really complex issue that, in my opinion, has very little to do with age.  If a 90yo were able to argue and fight for my rights and interests in a way that convinces others to join in, that person would have my vote.  Most 90yo's may not have the strength to get up and campaign, or stay up all night debating laws, and are maybe more likely to have health issues that will be a distraction or detraction from the job.  But not all of them.  And most 25yo's are likely to be too inexperienced to understand the nuances of policy and the reality of a vast diversity of situations in a nation as diverse as ours.  But then you have people like Greta Thunberg or the brilliant students from Stoneman Douglas (Parkland) who have tactfully challenged us and brilliantly argued for their causes, all of them teens when they first made their impact.\n\nWe need exceptional people running our government, people who are capable regardless of age or time in office.",

Whether it\u2019s for age or any other reason, if a representative is not representing the will of their electorate according to polling, there should be an easy way for the electorate to recall them. And it should be something that automatically comes up for review like at least once a year or something. Not just a typical election, but like an actual accountability procedure, in a formal setting like a court, in which the representative\u2019s performance is systematically reviewed and judged according to how aligned it is with the electorate\u2019s polled wishes. Have a standardized set of criteria, and if they don\u2019t pass it\u2026 they\u2019re removed from office and an election is called, in which the removed representative CANNOT be a candidate.\n\nRepresentatives need to have pressure applied to ensure they will actually represent their people. Because as it is\u2026 they\u2019re basically just given free rein until another election rolls around, in which the incumbent always has an advantage. And their electorate just has to wait around in the meantime, and hope that everybody who votes actually did their research when election time rolls around (spoiler\u2026 they don\u2019t). I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all noticed, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be working very well.",

You're talking about corruption and excess power of lobbyists.  Just look at the younger MAGA republicans who are in office today.  Many have been in office for 1-3 terms or so, almost none were in office 10 years ago.  With high turnover rates since the 1990s, we've really just seen the Republican Congressional caucus become a party of obstruction, as those who were interested in actually governing have retired or been voted out.  We see Democrats, often (but not always) older, pushing for reforms, climate change, industry regulation while their counterparts on the other side are pushing for government intrusion into our bedrooms, have no idea what a debt ceiling really is, and are calling for investigations into anyone who dares to besmirch their Cheeto King's name.\n\nAgain, this isn't an age issue.  It's an issue of either useful idiots or terrible people getting into office.  We won't fix that with term limits; there's plenty more MAGA loyalists to fill the void as we see every major election.  We fix that through making our voice known, demanding (nuanced, reasonable, helpful) change, voting out those who don't push for it, and voting to keep those who do uphold American values in office.",

We have the old guard refusing to let go in masse and trying to cash out in the process. Young Guns see the train and want to gorge on it, hoping they can find a way to stay in power until they die, something the elder politicians don't care about because they will be dead. \n\nRecall that President Von Hindenburg was 86 when he died in office, allowing Hitler to consolidate the last bit of power to secure his dictatorship. ([Source](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/germany-1933-democracy-dictatorship/))\n\nGeriatric governments are a dangerous sign something is wrong, and it needs to be addressed.

Companies that used to make oil rigs are already beginning to translate their knowledge to manufacturing platforms for wind turbines.  They'll also probably look into hydroelectric power, like harnessing wave energy.\n\nUltimately, I think the South is gonna be largely piecemeal, with wind in some places supplemented by solar in others and a continued reliance on traditional fuels in places that can't accommodate either.  There's a lot of open space, and even what's being used for farmland or ranches could partially incorporate solar arrays.\n\nBut yeah, our aging infrastructure is going to be a huge hurdle in the switch to renewables.  If reports like these don't result in substantial actions from politicians incentivizing energy companies to change that, then we're gonna be stuck with fossil fuels for a lot longer than necessary.",

It's an inevitability that they'll run out of oil.

That will probably last longer if EVs pick up at the rate they're expected to, but of course, demand will go down so it is essentially the same problem.  Such a massive portion of most petro-state GDP's rely on oil that there's bound to be some serious consequences if demand so much as drops, much less begins to dry up.\n\nThat whole climate change thing though... that could be the real killer, as these areas are particularly vulnerable to deadly temperatures.

They have been experimenting with pulling hydrocarbons out of the air from facilities purely running on renewable energy. They take the existing carbon in the air and create a synthetic fuel. The emissions still produce carbons, but it was recycled from what\u2019s already in the air.\n\nEthanol and Methanol can be obtained naturally and produce less hydrocarbons than the filter on the car cleans. So essentially, you are slightly cleaning the air as you go. The issue is that ethanol requires corn. Corn is very bad for the environment because they require tractors, trucks, etc. then you got to ship it. The return on fuel vs fuel consumption is way less than the fuel required for using oil. Methanol can be obtained from volcanoes where it occurs naturally. They just don\u2019t have enough facilities producing the fuel for the entire planet, same with the recycled hydrocarbon method in Peru.",

Which results in a decrease in the overall power required.\n\nIf it\u2019s transit, then a potential method to reduce that would be to impose a general limit on building additional roads/lanes and encourage public transit. Again, even using the same method of fuel, the total energy expenditure should go down. Particularly for populated areas.\n\nSure, we can\u2019t swap *today*, but we absolutely can swap over.",

How can I show you a commercially successful business supplying a service no one needs yet?\n\nThere is no large scale demand to recycle large lithium ion battery packs because most packs are still in service and aren't being thrown out.\n\nFor perspective, Teslas 2012 roadster batteries are only just hitting end of life, and there aren't enough of them to build a business around even if you somehow got an exclusive contract to recycle them.\n\nThere are companies that are recycling lithium in batteries, like Redwood Materials to name 1. Recycling large battery packs will largely be the same given that large packs are actually just a bunch of small batteries linked together.",

Energy storage in regards to the most standard stationary storage meant for daily usage has gotten radically cheaper for utility usage alongside solar and wind, so the good news is that the focus in some ways has already been shifted there. Also keep in mind that hydropower is a renewable energy source that is itself dispatchable \\*and\\* can be used as storage if used as pumped hydro facilities.",

Some of them were already considered war heroes from the Mexican-American War, or would be afterwards during the American Indian Wars. Hood was neither of these things though, and he wasn't even a particularly good general for the confederates. His post-war legacy amounted to little more than dying of yellow fever after his insurance company collapsed.",

I\u2019m sure you feel the need to defend this because you feel admitting otherwise would make you/the person you\u2019re discussing with a confederate apologist, but that\u2019s not accurate. If parts of a nation (especially a recently formed and vaguely defined one) want to break off on their own, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nWhat\u2019s the issue is doing so just to protect the slave trade that your economy is built on. \n\nRemember- being wrong about one thing doesn\u2019t make a person, group of people, nation, etc wrong about every single thing.",

It will be too little too late because of standard human greed and willful ignorance, but it will happen regardless. I'm surprised homeowners in that region aren't _much_ more interested in picking politicians who are talking seriously about the issue. Having no water, or limited water, would absolutely destroy property values. But I guess culture war nonsense is just too tantalizing to worry about trivial things like access to water.",

Sometimes he uses the hose to spray leaves out of his grass so he's out there for a long time just wasting water. Many times he waters in the heat of the day while the sun is directly on his yard. \n\nHe is a very \"I got mine\" kinda person. Made the comment one time, completely unprovoked, that he pays for it so he can do whatever. Clearly people have said shiz to him before then because why else feel the need to defend yourself? Also, that's not how water works man! \n\nFor that, along with some other reasons, I stopped acknowledging him. I really wanted to ask him though, So you're fine with rolling blackouts then right? Everyone is using whatever they pay for so you're fine having to go without when it happens yeah? \n\nHe wont be around when water becomes scarce so he doesnt care. As long as his pointless yard is watered and his cars are shiny(then it rains and was all for nothing). Baffling his adult sons dont get him to change his ways though. Guess they dont think it will ever affect them or their kids and so on. \n\nSorry, long rant. Just so sick of the whole \"I got mine\" mentality around here. Yay TX",

The scientists and the liberals are lying about it because they're evil and they want to hurt good ol' American farmers and conservatives living in dry, rural areas because that's what politics means to them: doing everything you can think of to hurt the other side as much as possible.\n\nThe solution, then, is to keep voting for politicians that oppose water restrictions and let them use as much as they need, because there's plenty of water to go around. In fact, they should probably use even more than they need just to prove that there's no shortage. They should probably just take it all so the Colorado River runs dry before it even gets to California, because the liberals need to learn what a real water crisis looks like.

These rights can be sold.\n\nThe only exception so far that I have seen is in Diamond Valley, NV. The came up with a multiplier that reduces EVERYONE'S water rights over thirty years, even those with the most senior of water rights. This was only possible because of a Nevada State Law that allows the state engineer to force a reduction plan in the face of emergency. Of course someone from San Francisco came in a bought the most senior of rights, and sued that it's 150 year established state law he could use as much as he wanted, but finally lost in the Supreme Court.\n\nThis is going to be the model for water reduction. Or actually pricing water at a true value; right now if you have rights you pay nothing or very, very little for using as much water as you want.",

The rules were made when the state's population was half what it is today and full of loopholes for politician's cronies. Most of the state, especially residential property, has to register a water pump with the state, meter their water, and only pump a certain amount a year. But giant swaths of land were given exemption to this and the farms on them can pump as much water as they want. The only limiting factor was how deep of a well they wanted to dig and how much they wanted to operate their pumps. On top of this the agency responsible for monitoring agriculture not in exempt areas had been so deregulated that only two agents were responsible for monitoring every well in the whole state. So because of this, in the middle of a drought in one of the driest places on the planet you have forests of nut trees and in this particular case a giant grassy acreage of alfalfa. All of these farms are unsustainable and absurd but this one growing feed for pampered horses that live on the other side of the world for people that speak funny and pray to the wrong God was the straw that broke the camel's back. There are lots more very bad offenders in the state and I wonder if they will be held accountable as well.",

Cop pulls someone over, and the narrator says \"we know\" and it was like 5 variations of that. So I turned to him and asked is you guys \"knowing\" enough to pull someone over for a weed related dui? And he said yeah, that's what they're training us. I told him that's bs, the signs of being high are the same as being stressed, being tired, being excited... so how do you \"know?\" He just shrugged and said driving while high is still a dui so it doesn't matter. Not an answer but ok",

Since weed has become legal in many of the states I drive in; I've seen greatly increasing numbers of dangerous drivers on the roads.  It's fuckin scary. \n\nI'm not claiming I'm anywhere near an expert, and am definitely not current in any certifications.  However, I have had training as well as experience with impaired drivers.\n\nAny sort of impairment whether it's sleep deprivation, drugs, or alcohol will endanger MANY people. \n\nIt would be irresponsible for law enforcement officers to not investigate.\n\nImagine this: cruising down the interstate at 70 mph in the left lane and suddenly encountering someone cruising along at 45 mph, (which is generally the minimum speed on most highways, so, no laws broken) and [insert horrible accident here] because they just hit a sweet blunt a few times.\n\nOr had a fight with their SO last night. Had to make a red eye flight. And got no sleep so they're messaging back and forth...\n\nMy point is that they WON'T know, the typical drunk driver cues might not be there, but the risk to the public is still there. Moreso in some instances.",

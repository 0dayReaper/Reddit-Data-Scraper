In this scenario, most if not all of the benefits you mention would not happen, due to the person(s) still being incarcerated as a result of the more serious crime that would remain on their record.\n\nThe only difference would be a removal of the marijuana charge, and a possible sentence reduction. There would likely be no immediate financial relief in the majority of these cases. That is unless they are at the end of their sentences and a judge can release them due to the removal of the marijuana charge.",

How do we value freedom so much and base the country off that principle, then end up in this situation? There's absolutely no excuse. The \"cost\" and the \"time\" it would take are excuses that people love to throw around to justify why things \"can't be done.\" We've already decided these people shouldn't be locked up, what more of a justifiable reason could you think of to spend extra, whatever the cost, to right this wrong and reunite people with their families and give them their dignity back as members of society that was wrongly and forcefully taken from them? This is a result of politicians who can't even fathom the idea of spending a day in jail being out of touch with reality and not being able to empathize with an average person and seeing people as statistics instead of equals. \n\nThis may just be a dumb rant that's all over the place but this infuriates me.  I would be livid if I was in this situation as I am watching multiple friends of mine try and navigate this process. Still locked up, even though the people who locked them up in the first place have essentially come out and said \"our bad, hope there's no hard feelings. We'll get you back to your life in a bit, but you know...we COULD do it quicker, but...that's a bit pricey for us, think we're gonna wait it out hope you don't mind.\"",

The judge was a 93 year old appointed by George Bush Sr back in the early 90s still hanging on to the job with his backwards olden day values and won't retire. Even the prosecutor was like please don't give him 9 1/2 years for a non violent pot charge, he doesn't deserve it. Prosecutor recommended 5 years. Judge just said fuck you I do what I want though. Usually they follow the prosecutor recommendation too but in this case his personal crusade against pot overrided the standard operating procedure.  Ridiculous. \n\nI feel so bad for my father he's 61 years old and hates prison so much. Knowing he has 6 more years to go is killing him and by extention me. I won't be truly happy again until he gets out. 6 more years to go. He wasn't trying to be scarface he was selling weed to his friend who has cancer and said it helped him a lot. Used the money to help me and my sister pay for college and graduate school. As I said, fucking kills me. Best part is we live in a legal state too. Federal police busted him.",

The cops could still arrest you but you'd have a good chance of the judge throwing out the case, no reason required.\n\nWhen I was in high school, maybe 1999, I knew a kid who drove to Harlem to get two ounces of the shittiest weed available. He is driving home with some other suburban hooligans stopped at an intersection, and a police car pulls up, not even behind him, or across, at the perpendicular road. He panicked (who knows why, he was 17 and he was not an experienced crap-weed drug runner) and made an illegal u-turn at the intersection. It took about 3 seconds for 3 cop cars to surround these aspiring entrepreneurs. The cops search the car and immediately find the dirt weed. One of the officers gets in his face and yells at him: \"You had us chase you for this?!?!? You started a car chase for this shit?!?!?! Get the fuck out of here!!!\"",

However, in practice, cops treat it like a misdemeanor on the streets, and will be more than happy to arrest you for it (then conveniently find another reason to put on the paperwork)\n\n\nI mistakenly thought this was a common term, but apparently not. It's used to point out the improper application of the law - it's not a legal term.",

It would result in a fine and not considered a conviction.  This is the vast majority of marijuana \u201cconvictions\u201d which aren\u2019t even criminal convictions because they aren\u2019t considered crimes under State Law.  \n\nNow if you were smoking in public or had more weight on you (exact weight escapes me) or were displaying marijuana in public then it was elevated to a B misdemeanor.  This would be the second most common marijuana charge,  For these there was a mandatory adjournment in contemplation of dismissal for a first time offenses.  So if the person stayed out of trouble the charge was dismissed.   No fines no conviction.  And almost always these cases were plead down to the violation and given a fine if they were not eligible for an ACD.  So most of the \u201carrests\u201d,  and I put that in quotes because for the vast majority of stand alone marijuana cases, where no other charges exists, there isn\u2019t an arrest but a Desk Appearance Ticket at worst, they do not result in a criminal conviction under New York Law as they end up as violations.  \n\nSo rarely, and I can seriously count on one hand how many times I saw it in Manhattan when I practiced criminal law there for ten years, does marijuana possession as a stand alone charge result in any criminal conviction (misdemeanor and above).   The exception to that is what I would describe as a super repeat offenders who had a rap sheets that was dozens of pages long with several charges for marijuana B Misdemeanors.  Then they would plead to the B with time served usually.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t apply to people transporting trunk loads of the stuff or selling, although selling, which was an A misdemeanor, was usually plead down to a B possession.  It simply was not worth the time to prosecute or spend time on these cases. \n\nI can\u2019t speak for other parts of New York but I would imagine in the cities (Syracuse, Albany, Buffalo, NYC etc) it was the same.   The more rural counties could have been harsher.\n\nBut that is way there aren\u2019t as many marijuana convictions as you might think.\n\nTL/DR:  NY law made simple possession a violation so technically there was no criminal conviction.  And further all first time charges of any marijuana possession that wasn\u2019t a felony were automatically dismissed after a set period of time (ACD.)",

Cuomo confirmed.\n\n\u201cFor too long communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by laws governing marijuana and have suffered the lifelong consequences of an unfair marijuana conviction,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nUnder the new law, which was passed in June and took effect on Wednesday, 10,872 people in New York City will automatically have their records wiped clean of marijuana convictions, according to a spokeswoman for the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. In the rest of the state, an additional 13,357 people will see marijuana convictions cleared from their records, the spokeswoman said.\n\nSealing these records would ensure that a person\u2019s marijuana-related conviction would not come up in most background checks, state officials said.\n\nA method for expunging the records, which has never been done in New York, is still being developed, the officials said. The process could take up to a year, a spokesman for the State Office of Court Administration, Lucian Chalfen, said.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit group, said the number of people who would have their records cleared could be many times higher than the number cited by the state; the alliance cited figures showing that between 1990 and 2018, 867,701 arrests were made in New York State for low-level marijuana offenses.\n\nUnder the new law, the classification of the penalty for possessing between one and two ounces of marijuana has been lowered to a violation, and fines have been capped at $200. Previously, such possession was a Class B misdemeanor. The fine for possessing less than one ounce of marijuana has been lowered to $50, from $150.\n\nThe move to reduce fines and clear people\u2019s records has been embraced by advocates of criminal justice reform, many of whom said criminal penalties for using marijuana fell disproportionately on black and Hispanic residents.\n\nKhalil A. Cumberbatch, an advocate who was pardoned by Mr. Cuomo in 2014 after serving time for a robbery conviction, said in a statement that expunging marijuana records \u201cgives people a new lease on life, removing the suffocating stain of stigma that prevents so many from reaching their highest potential.\u201d\n\nState Senator Zellnor Myrie of Brooklyn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he hoped lawmakers will build on this \u201cfirst step.\u201d\n\n\u201cI represent Brownsville; that was ground zero for a lot of this,\u201d he said of marijuana enforcement. Expunging records \u201cis just the beginning of the state recognizing the errors of that war.\u201d\n\nIn February, a study from John Jay College found that \u201cblacks and Hispanics consistently had higher rates of arrest for misdemeanor marijuana possession compared to whites.\u201d\n\nKevin Sabet, director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an advocacy group, said he embraced expunging low-level offenses, but not full legalization.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people in prison for marijuana use,\u201d Mr. Sabet said. \u201cBut the criminal sanctions on marijuana is not a reason to commercialize and normalize marijuana.\u201d\n\nMr. Sabet said he wanted to see marijuana possession likened to driving over the speed limit. \u201cIt\u2019s something discouraged,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something that is going to destroy your life if you\u2019re caught doing it.\u201d\n\nNew York began decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana in 1977, one of the few states to take such a step at that time. In 2014, the state legalized a medicinal marijuana program with restrictions that reflected Mr. Cuomo\u2019s apprehension toward the drug; for example, smoking and eating the drug are prohibited under that program.\n\nToday, more than 30 states allow medical use of marijuana. Eleven states have legalized the adult use of marijuana. Last year, the district attorneys in Manhattan and Brooklyn stopped prosecuting cases of marijuana possession and smoking in public.",

From simply wanting to be the guy with the dankest shit and adding a tiny sprinkle of something to up the high, to trying to get people hooked on their stuff specifically by adding something addictive.\n\nIt also happens when a dealer has cheap weed they want to make look better. Sprinkling a little bit of something on the weed can make it look like it's all covered in crystals, when in fact maybe its crystal meth (kind of joking about the meth part, honestly have heard of this happening with bath salts though).",

The tax is outrageous and I wish NY had that so I could contribute to my own state instead of another, but they deserve it for not being ass holes about it.",

It helps eliminate a lot of the transport costs/co2, you still need some local labour, we're working on improving water usage etc.\n\nIt's still priced to a premium at the super market, but I hope this will change eventually. Either way, lots of positives here.",

The effective shelf life of greens is less than a week.  Container ships take four to six weeks to transit the Pacific. They won't survive the journey.

The amount of small controllers like Arduinos that go into large scale hydroponics operations is enormous.  Hardly any of these operations would be possible if the product needed to be hand farmed much at all, at least not without massive labor exploitation.  Air temp, lighting, nutrient balance and air circulation all have to be measured and monitored at scale.  \n\nThis isn't a reason NOT to do it, but it does lessen the green impact somewhat due to the extensive need for semiconductors and rare earths to manufacture all the necessary chips.  Technology can help a lot here by making all these processes more efficient and the products less disposable and more fixable.",

Maybe nobody is going to steal the road itself, but they will steal your plough or the truck that gets the goods to market, that shit even happens is the states.  It is mostly metal and it has high power demands so fiber optic is never going to fix that as fiber is a terrible way to transmit power.\n\nThe larger problem in most places with a serious long term food issue is the political instability.\n\nWhen you have groups that are controlling the population by being the only source of goods they will destroy your infrastructure just to eliminate competition.\n\nWhen you have a civil war they will destroy your infrastructure to prevent you from supplying the enemy.\n\nWhen you have communism in a poor country you both have the risk that your property, tools &amp; supplies brought in to create infrastructure will be stolen by the government combined with the eventual destruction if whatever you built by time combined with the locals inability to maintain it.\n\nWhen you have organized crime like cartels you often have all of those things + the motivation to destroy other sources of employment + a significant risk of the foreign aid workers being killed or held for ransom.\n\nIt doesn't require much destruction at all to completely break down most of these efforts.  Usually you just have to break one link in the supply chain, particularly when you are trying to introduce a completely foreign methodology.  Ambush enough delivery drivers or scare off the labor and it is done for, the equipment will be abandoned or minimally guarded and eventually someone will walk off with it.\n\nEven religious charities and nonprofit NGOs eventually cut their losses and spend their resources elsewhere on a population that is less impossible to help.\n\nThe most recent widely reported example was when the Al Shabaab militants effectively stopped all aid into a big chunk of Somali. \n\nWhile you could create a system that not only brings food aid, but also brings enough military firepower to force it through, but such a group is understandably viewed as a greater risk to local sovereignty and would have even fewer opportunities where they are permitted to get involved and would have to turn down some of those opportunities when it is clear the host government is not interested in their military capabilities than their aid.\n\nThis example in Compton is much simpler to explain.  Produce is one of the first things to go when local crime starts to create a food dessert.  This produce will be well above market rates to begin with and at least initially have no significant local demand, but it will be low enough volume that it can still be sold as a novelty item in more affluent areas.\n\nIf it ever scales up to the point of being significant that will go one of three ways: increased labor and transportation demand will attract more people wanting a  blue collar job in a dense urban environment and the area will be gentrified naturally and large vertically-integrated grocery chains will take interest in the area again bringing in much lower cost produce.  The project achieves it's goal in a roundabout manner.\n\nThey scale without drawing a significant local workforce and have to force some very local gentrification through private security and dealing with the government to get some very targeted law enforcement (several of my suppliers are in this boat right now)\n\nThe third option is that they find that outside the local high end markets there isn't enough political lean for people to pay many times more for commodity products as a moral issue and that their growth is much more limited than they expect.  This leaves them without the ability to reach a critical mass that would naturally affect the area and also without the political and financial resources to force it.",

That would result in an almost 5x reduction in value in land in the USA.  Even more in the EU,  while it would only about double prices in Russia and Eastern Europe.\n\nIf that were to happen you would not only not need vertical farming because the demand isn't high enough but also because the land prices would make building vs using the land that is already there an even more expensive proposition.",

If you do have some, it\u2019s likely better to invest money into not wasting water we already have. \n\nWriting this comment, I actually looked up how much water is wasted by bad pipes, it was something ridiculous like 2 or 3 trillions gallons of water in the US alone. Consider the equivalent resource produced by desalinization, the brine output would be 3 to 4.5 trillions gallons, that\u2019s roughly 25 trillions pounds of salt, just for the water that leaks out of shitty pipes, not even for the one we actually consume.",

To your points:\n\n1) The intensity of the lighting can be adjusted automatically. When the sun shines, it will simply use less energy to light the place. \n\n2) Generated light also ends up as heat.\n\n3) See issue 1",

I'm saying that augmenting the artificial light with natural light doesn't make the heat problem better or worse. You have to deal with it either way, and to the same degree.

Additionally, the weight of produce can vary depending on the moisture content and density of different fruits and vegetables.\n\nTo provide a rough estimate, let\u2019s assume an average adult consumes around 1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) of produce per day, which includes fruits and vegetables. Multiplying this by 365 days in a year, it comes to approximately 547.5 pounds (248 kg) of produce per adult per year.\n\nDividing 4.5 million pounds by 547.5 pounds, we get an estimate of around 8,224 adults who could be fed for a year with that amount of produce.\n\nPlease note that this is a general estimate and may not accurately reflect individual dietary needs or consumption patterns. Additionally, factors such as storage, distribution, and waste should also be considered when evaluating the practicality of using a specific amount of produce to feed a certain number of individuals.*",

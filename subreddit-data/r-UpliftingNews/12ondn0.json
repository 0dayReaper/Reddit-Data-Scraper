However, it's important to recognize that the more training and education that doctors receive, the better they will be at their job and the more successful surgeries will be.\n\nMistakes can happen in any profession, but the stakes are particularly high in the medical field. That's why it's crucial for doctors to have access to ongoing training and professional development opportunities, to help them stay up to date with the latest techniques and procedures, and to ensure that they are providing the best possible care to their patients. Ultimately, this can help to reduce the risks associated with surgery and improve patient outcomes.",

I don't speak for everyone, but if I could have someone in the room when they do this, I absolutely wouldn't mind. I'm knocked out and someone I trust will be there to make sure nothing inappropriate happens, so go off.\n\nHonestly, it's more scary than uncomfortable. I don't know these people. I find it to be a huge violation when I haven't given consent. Even when I'm dead to the world, I'm still a person. I have the right to decide who sees my vagina while I'm in a vulnerable state.\n\nAlso, \"they're professionals\" isn't a good enough reason. \"They need to learn somehow\" isn't a good enough reason. They can learn with a patient's consent and someone they trust to be in the room.\n\nMy body, my choice. End of discussion.",

It's important to feel in control of your own body and to have a say in what happens to it.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize the expertise of medical professionals and to trust that they have your best interests at heart. It's like when you're learning to ride a bike - your parents might hold onto the back of your seat to help you balance and keep you safe.\n\nWhile patients should always have a say in what happens to their own bodies, we also need to consider that medical professionals are trained to provide the best care possible. It's like how you might not always get what you want for dinner, but your parents try to make sure you're eating healthy and nutritious food.\n \n\nThere is a reason they do this..  Have you ever had surgery before?",

I've had my uterine wall hole punched, and IUD inserted/removed, which is considered a small surgical procedure, but they make you stay awake for it...which is an entirely different topic.\n\nYou're not going to convince me here, friend. I already understand why they do it, but in the examples you've provided where I'm supposed to see all medical professionals in a caring and nurturing light...I'm awake and I could still refuse the food, or I could still end the bike learning experience.\n\nAs a person with a vagina, it's already a fraught experience with doctors (I've had my share of wonderful doctors, though). I do not need my body to be viewed in such a manner without a trusted person to stand in the room and with my consent. That is not a lot to ask for. It's literally the bare minimum of respect.\n\nI do not care how clinical and sterile it is. I need to have agency over my body and who sees and touches it.",

To be honest, an exam under anesthesia prior to starting a procedure can influence the approach to the surgery because the doctor can get a better exam than when the patient is awake. I find this a completely acceptable part of the procedure since it helps direct the surgery. However, it should probably be listed on the consent. The real  issue becomes if a medical student or resident is present and also does an exam under anesthesia without prior consent or if an exam is done when it does not pertain to the procedure being performed.",

This pelvic exam is a routine part of the surgery and part of the surgical consent typically although might not be explicitly discussed.  Often times there are multiple surgeons (resident surgeons typically) who although they are in training are integral parts of the surgical team. \n\nAt teaching institutions patients often consent generally to medical student involvement.  This usually means the medical student can do anything the surgeon can do under the supervision of the surgeon/physician. However their involement isn't typically crucial (but typically they're just holding retractors, cutting sutures and observing.)\n\nCombining the two consents above can be taken to allow for medical students to perform a pelvic exam prior to the surgery (because this is what the surgeon does), but there is not explicit consent for that.  This is what happened when I went through medical school and I think is the majority of what will be changed.  An explicit consent for pelvic exams will probably be added to preop consents.  \n\nNow notably many of these patients often have ovarian cancer or uterine cancer or other abnormality. It is important for doctors to be able to diagnose gyn cancers on exam, but you could have 200 standardize patients (healthy people paid to teach exams) and you wouldn't teach exactly what an ovarian cancer feels like.  \n\nWhat has probably happened before but much more rarely is people going in for a knee surgery and having a pelvic exam without consent, but I think that's what people mostly think is/was happening when they hear about this.",

I specifically asked my doctor what role(s) the med students would be playing during, mainly due to this fear, and she assured me they'd only be holding the instruments/camera and observing. I just wish they told me beforehand that this was part of the \"norm\" so I knew what to expect. Thanks.",

Iodine is used prior to inserting the catheter into the urethra to reduce uti risks.  Iodine isn't used as part of the pelvic exam, clear lubricant is. \n\nThere's been discussion that Foley catheter placement should be explicitly discussed with patients as well.  It's typically thought of as an associated procedure and the nurses do it so a doctor probably wouldn't mention it, but it can be unexpected to find iodine there when not expecting it. \n\nAs far as the utility to the surgeon, the pelvic exam can let you know if the uterus is antiverted or retroverted (which direction it flops).  You can get an idea of the size of the uterus.  If the person isn't obese you can feel the ovaries and associated tissues (adenexa).  This is helpful in knowing if there are any masses or adhesions that might complicate the surgery.\n\nFor a tubal ligation it's typically not as useful if everything is normal. It's just bad form to get the laparascopic instruments in and discover the uterus has a tumor that you could have easily felt on a pelvic exam and they perhaps needed a different surgery.   If the ovaries are coming out then it's a bit more important to get an idea of the size of things (usually the ovary is coming out for a cyst or something).\n\nCertain procedures also involve a vaginal manipulator that goes in and holds the cervix and uterus and allows you to move the uterus around which is helpful for positioning things during certain surgeries.",

Forms that do not lay that out do not grant consent for those students to perform invasive procedures simply as a learning tool. I assume that the 61% of students who stated they didn't have consent meant that they were familiar with the wording and knew they didn't have consent to use the patient in this manner, not that they didn't deliver the clipboard themselves.",

Those are often done weeks before surgery by an attending or resident when the med student isn\u2019t even on rotation yet. \n\n61% of med students didn\u2019t explicitly obtain consents because it wasn\u2019t their job. That doesn\u2019t mean the majority of pelvic exams are done without consent.",

But it's standard practice for good reason, so you get over that.\n\nThe \"study\" surveying med students on whether they \"explicitly\" obtained consent is flawed because, as others have pointed out, *medical students don't obtain informed consent for anything, period.*\n\nEdit: Yes, there are awful anecdotal stories of someone waking up in stirrups after being sedated and not having consented to a pelvic exam, or worse.

We had paid instructors on whom we practiced speculum exams in the clinic setting to observe the internal and external anatomy, practice collecting swabs/brushing/scrapings for STD testing and pap smear, etc. They are awesome women who can give students real-time feedback on their technique. The bimanual exam under anesthesia in an OR before, say, a hysterectomy is part of surgical planning. You get a higher quality, more useful exam under anesthesia when everything is relaxed. An ob/gyn could give you a better explanation of why. But please be assured that medical students aren't just \"practicing\" on unconscious patients because it's more convenient than getting consent from awake patients.",

The last thing I need is excessive soreness or even tearing/damage compounding whatever treatment I was already requiring.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s not always specifically explained that multiple people will be repetitively performing a highly invasive examination. This, compounded with women generally not having their pain respected in medicine, leaves me very wary of consenting to a lot of things that are probably in good faith. I don\u2019t know when I can trust that I will truly be heard and respected in medicine.\n\nI have had doctors dismiss my concerns, I\u2019ve had doctors belittle the pain I was feeling, tell me that there\u2019s nothing wrong and that the pain is normal, even when it severely compromised my ability to live and work normally. I would not trust those doctors to perform these highly invasive exams - since they do not consider my pain worthy of account.",

When I say \"how would you like it if you had to volunteer your vagina or asshole for study\" I stand by my point. You do realize it's not just women, right? It happens to men, too. Any male med students want their classmates probing them? Bet not. \n\nRegardless, this change needs to come from within. Why is progress so slow banning this everywhere? Because those in the medical field push back. You seem to think that all it takes is soliciting volunteers for medical professionals to stop violating patient rights, yet here we are having to fight *the medical field* to merely get them to *ask for consent*. Please explain to me why that is. Why aren't they using volunteers or providing patients with the option to opt out already? \"The easiest thing to do ...\" Yeah. Easy for us to say, apparently too inconvenient for them to do. \n\n&gt;The goal should be to ensure no women are put in that position. The easiest way to do that is to find willing volunteers.\n\nAdd men to that, and I have not said anything but this in any comment.",

Seems like a problem of the past.\n\nEDIT: After reading follow up articles in the comments, it seems people are simply understanding how medicine works. Let\u2019s start with the facts:\n\n1: if you come in for an appendectomy or heart surgery, literally no one will be going near your vagina. Not the doctor, not the med student, no one. It\u2019s not only a breach of medical ethics, it\u2019s literally battery and everyone in the room would be liable. \n\n2: if you come in for a gynecological procedure, you will be given a consent form. Somewhere on that form will be a list of procedures to be performed, and somewhere on that list will be \u201cpelvic exam under anesthesia or \u2026. And all other medically indicated procedures\u201d. \n\nWhen you sign that, you have now consented to the pelvic exam. You don\u2019t explicitly consent to WHO performs the pelvic exam. You are entitled to ensure that only the attending performs it, but the doctor does not need to obtain consent for each and every person in the room. \n\nMost of these articles are written from the perspective of either a medical student who doesn\u2019t understand how surgical consent works (not surprising, most medical students are not allowed to consent patients) or from a patient who doesn\u2019t understand what is and isn\u2019t medically indicated.",

Absolutely not. Many people are only ok with pelvic exams because they otherwise never see that doctor in public. Imagine having to see someone every single day who has given you a pelvic exam. This would be hard for any person, let alone young adults. And obviously there is the whole thing of \"do I have to do this to pass?\"",

They were using unconscious women to train medical students to do pelvic exams when the women were under for operations that had nothing to do with that area of their body and they weren't asking for consent first or even informing them afterwards. This was legal in many states.",

Here's the direct quote:\n\n&gt; Ninety-two percent reported performing a pelvic exam on an anesthetized female patient. Of that group, 61 percent reported performing this procedure without explicit patient consent.\n\nThat's one isolated survey of 101 medical students from various schools. PBS stated it was [\"the non-consensual exams are still allowed in 29 states\"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-more-states-are-requiring-consent-for-pelvic-exams-on-unconscious-patients) in February of this year.\n\nAccording to [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/health/pelvic-medical-exam-unconscious.html), a doctor \"surveyed 401 students at five Pennsylvania medical schools and found that 90 percent had performed pelvic exams on anesthetized patients.\" In the same article is this quote: \"Ryan O\u2019Keefe, a fourth-year medical student in Pennsylvania, [said] they were told to check the consent forms that patients signed before the operation, although he said he 'would not be surprised if now and then people didn\u2019t check.'\"",

            "comment": "Due to drought, the south end of the great salt lake was increasing in salinity and threatening the unique wildlife that relies on it. In February, the Union Pacific railroad (at the governors request) constructed a berm on their causeway across the lake to prevent water from flowing from the south end to the north end (where salinity is not a concern) to try and raise water levels in the south end. It appears to have worked and now water has raised enough in the south end of the lake that it is overtopping the berm and flowing north. This is great news for wildlife.",

So it's probably just short term...\n\nAlso some our city roads have also gone up in average water depth!\n\nBut very uplifting for now! Hopefully the berm provides long term benefits. SLC is as green as I've ever seen it right now.",

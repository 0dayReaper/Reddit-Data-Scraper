The only way they can preserve their culture is through a stable relationship with the land, and the only way they can maintain that is through the modern system of ownership. Whether their ancestors would have approved isn't really relevant.",

The only given with humans is that we change. When invaders happen, cultures find a way to adapt and maintain their traditions as best as they can. So, maybe land ownership wasn\u2019t a thing X hundred years ago. But if you believe that the earth beneath your feet sustains your community, it\u2019s much better to have access and rights to that earth with a land purchase than to not have access to it because your ancestors wouldn\u2019t have had a deed for the land.\n\nFor example if I bought my dog. That\u2019s the way I had to operate in society to get that creature to be a part of my family. But that doesn\u2019t mean I treat my dog as a purchased thing or my property. I honor my dog\u2019s life and show it love and respect. I think both things can (and in a capitalist society, must) exist. *(Not comparing Indigenous folks to dogs. Just using a super simple example I think might be relatable to lots of folks across cultural lines \u2014 though some cultures aren\u2019t too dog friendly, so substitute your most beloved animal companion.)*",

Are we just picking and choosing random cutoffs for ownership because of guilt?  \n\nSerious question.  And disagreeing with your narrative does not make me negative, cynical or toxic.  \n\nIt makes me curious and up for debate, you know, as in a discussion, like what Reddit was made for.",

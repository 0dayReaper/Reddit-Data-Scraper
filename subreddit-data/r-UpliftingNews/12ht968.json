His goal is to help the children get acclimated to the barber shop so they can feel comfortable coming in when other employees and clients are there. \n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vernon-jackson-barber-free-haircuts-children-with-special-needs-opens-noble-barber-beauty-on-day-off-cincinnati/",

It was the hub of an ancient civilization spanning the southwest with a trade network reaching south America.\n\nFor the people commenting that the Navajo didn't like the drilling ban: there's something you need to be aware of. The Navajo are a different tribe than the people who lived in Chaco and considered it sacred. Those are the Pueblo people. Because of forced migration, the Navajo nation now touches Chaco. But the people who consider it sacred are the Pueblo people. There's different perspective because native Americans aren't a monolith. There's completely different tribes and individuals with different concerns and priorities.\n\nAs a side note, the ruins at Mesa Verde, the national park in Colorado, were also built by the Pueblo people.",

Chaco, Hovenweep, Mesa Verde, Moon House, Fish and Owl, Canyon of the Ancients, Aztec, and Chimney Rock were the ones I was able to hit up while living in the region but there is so much more to see. The 4 corners area is an amazing place. Rich in scenery and culture.",

This is the premise of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. States have signed into law that once enough states join that they have enough electors to ensure the popular vote wins, they will have them vote based on it.",

They have majority and could choose the other state.\n\nThe thing about the EC is that it gives unfair power to EVERY states majority party. So if you are a Republican in Illinois your vote is wasted in every election because Illinois will never vote Republican.\n\nThis leads to states that often swing votes to have way more voting power than their population or actual economic situation would normally be.\n\nMy opinion is that we are stuck in a political deadlock because we are arguing issues that have been settled by 80% of the population but Iowa cares about it so it continues to be debated. Abortion, gay marriage, gun control, and trans rights are issues rural states are struggling with but have nothing to do with Federal level issues like Climate change, housing crisis, or foreign wars.\n\nIn my very humble opinion by dropping the EC (and having early primaries in states with people in them), we would have parties that better reflect the nation's issues and actual beliefs.\n\nAlso I don't see why small states should be specially protected. Mainers should not have better representation than Texans just because they are small, they should have the same and build coalitions with other states that share their views.",

California alone would pretty much make the Midwest irrelevant on the federal level if it had an appropriate level of representation based on the population.\n\nBut, fixing that *would* require a Constitutional Amendment.

Their problems can be ignored due to louder discussions, and a state can be stuck with a long-term issue because they aren't politically important.\n\nFor example's sake, let's pretend that the amount of fishing done on the east coast is controlled federally. As far as the federal government and many east coast states are concerned, this is not a problem -fish move around, and it makes sense to manage it federally. \n\nBut what if Maine is extremely dependent on fishing? What if 10, 15, or 20% of their economy would collapse if fishing was stopped for this year? Well, you expect other east coast states to build a coalition with them. But if those states are much more populous, with diversified economies, it may not be important to them at all. Their economies may easily handle the disruption, and their budgets might not notice the increase to their social programs.\n\nA fundamental problem in democracies is this imbalance.  It may be that the government is competent and rational, and Maine is listened to about how this policy could destroy it for decades, but it's just as, if not more possible that some political zeitgeist has hit and they will be rolled over with a policy change that pays no attention to what it's going to do about Maine.\n\nNow, I chose that example deliberately because (as far as I know) it's not real for Maine. Should things still be made fair and equal? Yes. But there was a reason why it was made this way in countries all over the globe, and acknowledging any new system has to tackle this problem another way is important, too.",

Or keeping it too vague could also prevent oil companies from doing important service work on existing wells which could then cause water contamination.  People think lobbying = buying off politicians. Corruption is serious, illegal, and needs to be strictly enforced.

Then when the Supreme Court (Judicial branch) hears a case that directly challenges the Federal government's authority to make states adhere to Roe v Wade, they overturn it because Congress never passed any legislation giving them the authority to do so.",

The Southern Utes are one of the few groups of natives that were moved to an area that was deemed undesirable but got lucky wound up striking oil. They played it smart and didn't sell off these oil rights and instead made a small fortune. Once you turn 18 you get a monthly living expenses check, your college is paid off, and healthcare is free. This has had both negative and positive effects on the tribe but it's an example of how oil did change the trajectory of the natives. The Navajo nation is much larger and has not been nearly as fortunate. I can see why they would want to hold onto this source of revenue.",

I\u2019m not sure if the state and federal government gets a slice or not. \n\nThere\u2019s also general taxes for each barrel of crude produced that varies per state. \n\nThis particular land dispute would have had a direct revenue stream to the Navajo Nation.

The Navajo Nation completed its own study last year and advocated for a smaller area to be set aside given the economic impacts a withdrawal would have on the tribe.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Navajo Nation attempted to compromise by proposing a 5-mile buffer as opposed to the 10-mile,\u201d Curley said. \u201cThe Biden Administration has undermined the position of the Navajo Nation with today\u2019s action and impacted the livelihood of thousands of Navajo allotment owners and their families.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration ignored negotiation requests from the Navajo, as the Navajo didn't want this big of an area marked as non-drillable.

The biggest great house, Pueblo Bonito, is thought to have been at LEAST 5 stories tall with over 600 rooms. The stone masonry of the Chacoans is stunning and unparalleled by anything else in the Southwest. Chaco Canyon ruins beat Pompeii to me!\n\nBecause the ruins are built in a canyon, fracking destabilizes both the ruins and can make large blocks of sandstone fall off the cliffs, like the one that crushed part of Pueblo Bonito back in the 40s.

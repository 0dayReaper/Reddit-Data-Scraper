It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said.  \nBut he warned the decision to remove the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. \"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.",

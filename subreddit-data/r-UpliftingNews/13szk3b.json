She stayed glued to the computer all her waking hours\u2014resting fro 4-5 hours.  \nShe said \u201cI learned a lot of things compared to my knowledge\u201d acquired in Afghanistan where she did her BTech from. She self-learnt English to be proficient.\n\n\u201cBut the knowledge I got in the two years with IIT-Madras is not comparable with the knowledge I got in my BTech programme. This is one of the big reasons I want to go to academics and not any industrial job. I can feel the needs of the education system in Afghanistan. Now that I have seen the high standards of IIT-Madras, I want to bring this standard to my country. If the new government lets us. Here we are facing a lot of difficulties,\u201d Behishta said.\r  \nThe Taliban have widely implemented their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, banning female students from attending universities, girls from middle school and high school, women from most employment and ordering them to wear head-to-toe clothing in public.\r  \nBehishta said the situation is depressing and frustrating for women. \u201cThe girls I would tell them to please study. Study as much as you can. Study at home, read a book, study everything available. Don't go into depression. We will stand against this cruelty. We will change them,\u201d she said.\r  \nHer name also means optimism and hope\u2014but there\u2019s a tinge of sadness. \u201cYou will always find me smiling. I can tell you a lot of Afghans are smiling. They are not actually happy. They are not smiling. It\u2019s in their nature to smile at the struggles,\u201d she said.\r  \nTo the world outside Behishta said: \u201cNo, we are not Talibans, we are not terrorists. We are the common people. I don't want to go into politics; the common people want to see the country comparable with other improved countries. The only solution for my country is education. And I really thank all Indians, all those who are having parts for making me whoever I am right now. I will never forget this. I know one day this black time will pass.\u201d",

So that we can be uplifted when change happens and the oppressor is removed. It's literally a plea for help and change. Being satisfied with her survival tends to read to me based on my experiences as an excuse to not act. Now I do want to acknowledge my experience there. I have seen how the generation in power reacts to that part and it's with inaction. I want to get to the uplifting bit when she's able to teach freely this next generation.",

The first example is absolutely nothing like this case here - in that scenario, it's justice that the murderer was captured. It's good that he was captured, but it's also how the world \"should\" work, so to speak - the bad guy gets caught, and the entire world, including the establishment, would condemn him. This is an example of a girl persevering through a bad situation *and rising above and away from it* - it's uplifting because it shows that humanity exists even in terrible times. Yang having that tiny bit of Yin in it isn't uplifting (even when it crushes it, as it'll just come back), but that tiny point of Yang in the Yin is. Make sense?\n\nThe latter example isn't uplifting for precisely the same reason - now if the kid got therapy and healed from his trauma, that would be uplifting. \n\nBasically, you're focused on the kid having trauma - on the girl being stuck in Afghanistan. I'm focusing on the fact that she *got out*. A person managing to rise out of a bad situation is what's uplifting here.\n\nEDIT: And to add to my earlier bit, obviously child murder isn't part of how the world \"should\" work - but a person being punished for committing a wrongdoing, especially so severe a one, *is* (the problem arises when the definition of a wrongdoing gets murky).\n\nEDIT: And when I say \"got out,\" I don't mean \"of Afghanistan.\" I mean that she now has the tools to better fight back - it's about the hope in dark times that a situation like this shows.",

You figure out how to live with it. So I can't pretend that it's positive. This doesn't mean you cannot have had trauma. It's just I cannot ignore that cost. I also cannot see that one person escaped and then not think about those who didn't. That's the cost of my empathy. Again doesn't mean you lack empathy but our brain has gone to different spots. \n\nThe arguments I did not make were a lot more blunt. I was trying to avoid accusatory wording and cruel things since not seeing things the way I do is not bad but it can be. Do you think this woman is uplifted by escaping? I think sometimes. Other times like in the interview she is thinking of the cost. That cost just for her is incredibly high. She can never go back. She cannot see the people left behind. She has lost family, has perhaps had the entire moral foundation of her upbringing challenged, and she cannot unlive the harm. Sure she survived but that's forever.",

This girl's experience reminds me that people can get through tough times and move forward strongly. The theoretical kid is the exact same - to be able to live a reasonably normal life *even after suffering such horror* is uplifting. Sure, the situation isn't perfect. But it's *better*. That makes me a bit happier. Of course, things are hard. The Afghanistan situation is horrible. But as of the moment, the situation exists. So every story of a person who manages to show that it's still possible to resist is a good thing that reminds me of the good in humanity and our ability to push forward.\n\nMay I also note that the article mentions she is still in Afghanistan, and my poor phrasing in my last comment implied the inverse. A large part of what's uplifting here is that people can get the tools to fight back against the world, even when the whole world is against them. Yes, the world can be bleak - *but that can change*.\n\nBack to the child murderer - the whole world is, rightfully, against him. He's horrible, and the world crushes him because he's horrible. That's justice, and the way things \"should\" go (obviously child murder shouldn't be part of how the world works, but it is). However, it's also the norm, and so it's not uplifting - it shows how horrible things happen even in a decent society. But a girl striving to outsmart and surpass her oppressors *is* uplifting because the entire world is against that girl. It's a show of how human goodness and spirit can shine through in dark times, and things can eventually change so that people such as that girl win out in the end. It's about the hope it gives. \n\nI feel like you view the world through a very negative perspective. Sure, that perspective is earned. But not everybody has that perspective. Like you, I'm trying to explain that yours isn't always bad, but it's not necessarily always good either.",

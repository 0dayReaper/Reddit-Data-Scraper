                    "comment": "There are, surprisingly, a lot of of ways the governments of the US can legally take your private property without any practical recourse. An infamous example being abuse of civil forfeiture statutes - e.g. the ability for the police to find your personal property guilty (yes, you read that correctly) of involvement in a crime and then keep it without due process. Because property does not have the same rights as a person, you must usually prove, at your own expense, that your property is innocent or you don\u2019t get it back. \n\nBy abusing civil forfeiture laws, police can, for example, confiscate and keep large sums of cash they they find on you or on your property during the course of their duty. If the cost to fight this abuse exceeds the value of the property taken, it essentially boils down to legalized state-sponsored robbery. This is just one example of various legal theft schemes that exist.",

They are likely getting that from a [2015 Washington Post report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/), or a another post inspired by it. The WP report found that \u201cfederal asset forfeiture in 2014 accounted for over $5 billion going into Justice and Treasury Department coffers, while in comparison, official statistics show that the amount stolen from citizens by burglars during that same year was a mere $3.5 billion.\u201d So it\u2019s all federal asset forfeiture, not just cases people think the person was innocent. I\u2019d imagine the cases of like a restaurant owner getting $50k stolen are outweighed by the large cartel busts, although I don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nIt is worth noting this is just federal asset forfeiture, I\u2019m not sure the amounts for state and local. But it is also just burglary and robbery, 2 specific types of theft. So it\u2019s hard to get a full picture here.\n\n[This follow up article claims](https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/cops-still-take-more-stuff-from-people) that it\u2019s on average about $3.6 billion a year, including state and local. However, it seems to very significantly year by year. Between 2014 and 2019, it has been as low as $2 billion, and as high as $6 billion. Burglary is more consistent, so only 2 of the 5 years following the initial WP report did civil asset forfeiture still exceed burglary.",

As a result, \"you have $25,000 on you, only a criminal would have that much cash so I'm taking it\" seizures have ended.\n\nThat does **not** mean the problem has gone away, though as a) the property doesn't have to be owned by the person who committed the crime, which leads to forfeiture of property owned by e.g. family members of criminals (e.g. \"My son borrowed my car and got arrested selling drugs from it, and the police took took it\"),  and b) since a **conviction** still isn't required (just a concurrent arrest/warrant/contraband seizure), there can still be a temptation to seize assets based on flimsy accusation (e.g. you have a gram of pot on you, you must be a drug dealer, so we're arresting you and keeping this money), which in many cases is motivated by factors like racial bias.\n\nIt's a major improvement from where we were 10 years ago, but it seems patently obvious to most people that without a conviction, the property should be returned.",

But HOAS are typically designed to keep the neighborhood in a certain condition or to maintain a standard. (Makes the home prices go up more over time) for some areas and lifestyles HOAS are great. There is an area of living that has an HOA nearby the elderly people flock to because of the HOA. They pay a certain amount per month and they don't have to do any yard work. The sidewalks are washed their gutters are cleaned out etc. It is great for people that don't want to have to deal with all that. But you also cannot put up a fence etc in the yard. So it's not for everyone. I personally don't want anyone telling me what I can do on my own land or house but, I can see the benefits for some.",

They actually work out pretty okay.\n\nYou pay a fee for them which is technically not required - but your home insurance will drop by more than the cost. They'll still put out the fire if you didn't pay - but then charge you an arm and a leg.\n\nThe advantage is that they tend to be much more cost conscious. Saw an interview with a private fire chief talking about how much more many public firefighters were spending on firetrucks which were identical except for a slightly bigger cab for more legroom.\n\nI'm not sure I'd trust it in urban areas for various reasons. But seems fine in rural areas.",

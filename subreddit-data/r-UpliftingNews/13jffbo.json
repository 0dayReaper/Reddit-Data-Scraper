            "comment": "Translated article:\n\n&gt;**Chemical company 3M must pay damages of 2,000 euros to a family from Zwijndrecht. This was decided by the justice of the peace of the fifth canton in Antwerp. Abnormally high amounts of PFAS were found in the blood of the parents and their two children. \"The gates are opened for the thousands of local residents,\" says attorney Geert Lenssens.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The family lives about a kilometer from the 3M plant in Zwijndrecht. During excavation work for the Oosterweel connection, it turned out that the soil around the company site was contaminated with PFAS, which can cause all kinds of health problems.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The family members had themselves tested and PFAS levels were found in their blood up to more than one hundred times the permissible amount. PFAS was also found in their vegetable garden.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The family went to the justice of the peace to seek damages from the chemical company based on \"excessive neighborly nuisance.\" The justice of the peace ruled that all conditions for liability for neighborly nuisance were met.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The nuisance is excessive since the established PFAS values in the area where plaintiffs live are abnormally high,\" the judge ruled. \"This increase, and therefore the nuisance, is attributable to 3M since it has been established that most of the PFAS contamination in the province of Antwerp comes from 3M.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, the justice of the peace ordered 3M to pay preliminary damages of \u20ac2,000 to the family, or \u20ac500 provisionally per family member. If further damages (bodily harm, decrease in property value and air, soil and water pollution) are later determined, this could increase.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\"The gates are opened\"**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is the first time a PFAS pollution case has been pleaded in our country. It is even a European first, Lenssens said. The ruling in this case could set an important precedent for other local residents who also want to go to court.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The gates are opened for the thousands of people who live nearby,\" Lenssens says. \"It's not only about the residents of Zwijndrecht, but also of Antwerp. The time is over when big factories do what they want.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to Lenssens, more residents will also effectively join a claim for damages. \"We are convinced that a lot of people are going to wake up and join a pressure group like \"Dark water 3M.\" They will definitely start a class action where all neighbors can join. The people have an interest in it, because there is a threat of expiration. It is the time to act.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Just because it seems like a low amount right now doesn't mean it can't end up high*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2014 Environmental law attorney Isabelle Larmuseau  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Environmental law attorney Isabelle Larmuseau calls the proceedings before the justice of the peace \"unusual.\" She was not herself involved in this process, but she does follow the PFAS case closely. \"This path did offer the advantage of a quick processing, while the other lawsuits that are ongoing can drag on for years. This was not an obvious one. Still, it is very good to note that the justice of the peace responded to it in this way. And that he actually tested against the conditions of abnormal neighborly nuisance. It is not surprising that these were met, because they are, after all, weighty facts.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The compensation in itself is not very high, 2,000 euros, but Larmuseau stresses that it is a provisional amount. \"I think that they have been very moderate in the initial amount, because 3M's neighbors are in the difficult position of not being able to prove every possible damage item in black and white. That will become clearer in the coming years. Just because it seems like a low amount right now doesn't mean it can't end up high.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Battery of lawyers**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The judgment can still be appealed. Larmuseau expects 3M will certainly do so. Just because there is now an opportunity for other local residents to also start similar proceedings. \"We also have a battery of lawyers and we won this case,\" Lenssens responds. \"We're not going to stop here. We're going to make 3M pay. That's our mission.\"\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)",

Screenshot.\n\nBy: Francesco Zucconi\n\nUpdated: June 10, 2023, 03:11 PM\n\nDuring a structural fire that broke out in a residential area of Lima, the capital of Peru, a young Colombian became a hero. He braved the danger of the flames to rescue 25 puppies that were trapped in the blaze.\n\n\"Wilson looked at us as if he wanted to tell us something\": a member of the Civil Defense\nAccording to what was reported by the Peruvian media, the fire occurred inside a recycling warehouse and 11 fire units were needed to deal with the emergency, the origin of which is still unknown.\n\n\n\nPrecisely, the rescuers fought for more than four hours to extinguish the flames. As a result of this work, three firefighters were injured. They received timely medical attention and were discharged quickly.\n\nTragedy in Bucaramanga: Pitbull dogs attacked and killed a 4-year-old boy\nSocial networks are moved and excited by the video starring Sebasti\u00e1n Arias, the young Colombian who risked his life and rescued 25 puppies that were about to be hit by the flames.\n\n\n\n\nNot caring about the danger, Arias went up to a balcony and then reached a third floor. The Colombian had to break a window to reach the roof of the structure, where the trapped animals were.\n\n\n\n\nOnce there, he took the puppies and threw them away. Below were several members of the community with mattresses and sheets that cushioned the fall of the animals, which were safe and sound.\n\nThis Colombian stated that he felt that he should help the dogs since he has one and he is not capable of imagining that he would be burned to death.\n\n\u201cI saw the dog that was up in the corner, I have this beautiful little animal and I wouldn't want my dog to burn to death. Hearing his cries, his moans, I wouldn't want my dog to die like that. I love them, I am fascinated by dogs. I worked in that recycler and I knew where the animals were. I don't know how I got up so fast, the adrenaline made me go up\u201d, said Sebasti\u00e1n Arias, the hero of the day.\n\n***\n\nhttps://noticias.caracoltv.com/mundo/colombiano-es-heroe-en-peru-rescato-a-25-perritos-que-estuevien-a-punto-de-morir-en-incendio-rg10\n\nhttps://translate.google.es/?hl=es&amp;tab=TT",

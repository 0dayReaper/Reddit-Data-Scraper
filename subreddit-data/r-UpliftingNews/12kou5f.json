The one group he didn't do so well with was Black voters which they then rhetorically expanded to include other POC which wasn't really the case.\n\nHere for example:\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-leads-nationwide-among-black-hispanic-white-voters-poll-1487934](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-leads-nationwide-among-black-hispanic-white-voters-poll-1487934)\n\nBasically you have a media narrative that even good progressives fell for. Of course people wanted to address his deficit with black voters, but it becomes a different issue when it's claimed that he had a **specific** issue with Black voters. Bear in mind he was blowing most other candidates out of the water even with black voters. People like Klobuchar and Buttigege had almost negative support from Black people but that wasn't even mentioned most of the time. For Buttigege the narrative was flipped and they started accusing black people of being homophobic to explain away his atrocious numbers.\n\nI got carried away there but you see my point.",

I probably work more fridays then i have off so i might aswell be on 5 day weeks right now. but friday is 100% overtime so Its good extra money and its in my contract im only required for monday to thursday so if i dont want to work the friday i have no obligation to so i do deny them when i want. \n\nAlot of The trades are actually starting to pick up the 4 day week as it  benefits our industry the most i think. guys are getting the same amount done in 4 10 hour shifts as 5 8 hour shifts, this leaves a entire extra day in the week to finish projects if you start falling behind. Also makes it easier to get 2 crews going if you do 4 on 3 off with one day of overlap to ensure communication. or some do 4 on 4 off and run 2 crews that way. And when doing hard labour intensive jobs getting 3 day weekends guys are coming back on monday less burnt out and ready to work so more actually gets done in the week. I dont see office or retail or customer service type jobs seeing the same type of benefits other then its just better for mental health. So i imagine they will be alot slower and less inclined to pick it up.",

Let's just wait out the boomers on the high castles to leave post so that the 'old ways' will be considered absolutely obselete. Except countries like Japan, unfortunately. Their workforce culture is so ingrained to making their employees suffer as much as possible to earn livable wages, which is becoming more and more non viable as economic conditions worsen worldwide.",

Some good friends of mine have a small bar/restaurant that does breakfast brunch and lunch and they will be losing a succession of Mondays which is typically their busiest day along with Friday. They're not happy at all and dreading the financial lots on top of what are already incredibly high wholesale prices.\n\nI will say that broadly speaking I am absolutely for this idea, BUT it's a little more nuanced and not everyone wins.",

You get a 4 day work week IF you can increase the average salary by 20%.\n\nAnyone can do a 4 day work week now if they go part time, or become a freelancer or contractor so you are your own boss. But nobody can afford to live on a part time salary. Becoming a contractor is tricky business too because you don't get the stability a company employment provides.\n\nEssentially the 4 day work week needs the economy to improve and housing to become affordable to be realised.",

When I say \"Fix the economy\", it means you need to get the money circulating in society again, not rely on trickle down economics. \n\nBut saying that makes you admit the problem is a lot more challenging to solve. Nobody understands how to fine tune taxes, tariffs, and subsidies.\n\nSo here you get people saying the solution is very simple, a 4 day work week! The only people stopping this is the bosses and CEO's! But if this was the case, these people would've already quit their job to become contractors and freelancers. No middleman taking a cut from me and my client! But they don't, because when they do it, suddenly finding clients and getting yourself paid is suddenly a challenging task that companies and bosses won't understand.\n\nWhy this paradox? Because somewhere they know they can't make the 4 day week work themselves. It's easier to say someone in the company it stopping this from happening than admit the entire economy is suffering from working poverty, and smaller companies aren't exactly rolling in money as well.",

The problem was that the 4 day week with only 2 extra hours every day exhausted us. (Admittedly, it\u2019s a tough job under any circumstances.)\n\nBy the end of our 4 day work weeks, we needed the extra day off just to rest and recover from the new schedule. We were burning out more quickly from what had seemed like a tiny addition to our daily schedules.\n\nWe went back to a 5 day, 40 hour schedule.",

Also means support staff have more opportunities for off hours work (I work in IT, and it's common that planners outside of IT forget to account for maintenance on their systems).",

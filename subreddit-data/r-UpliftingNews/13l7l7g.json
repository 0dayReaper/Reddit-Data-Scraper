Including but not limited to:\n\nLack of funding for crime labs (personnel, training, materials, buildings)\n\nOutdated rules on what kits can be submitted (e.g. only if you have a named subject)\n\nLow priority to law enforcement\n\nInvestigators not believing victim's report or deciding victim consented (was asking for it)",

I\u2019m not advocating naming innocent randos, but like what if you had a friend who offered to be the name just so the kit could go through?",

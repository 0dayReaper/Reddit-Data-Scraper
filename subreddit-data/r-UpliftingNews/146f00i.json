They then cancel community events, close the local museum, and raise rates by a significant amount claiming that the council is broke, even though the rates are some of the highest in Tasmania.\n\nPrevious mayor Steven Kons also used his time in council to build himself a generous real estate portfolio - including a school that he knocked down and redeveloped into high density townhouses.\n\nI wish someone brought light to the corruption that has gone on within burnie for years.",

The CBD that already struggles with expensive parking. \n\nFunny how they've managed to systemically get rid of all the free parking options! How selfless of the city council to donate that *one* carpark area, and nowhere else...\n\nEdit; Also one of the most zealously religious City council's I've ever come across btw. Prosperity gospel, Evangelist stuff. Used to see the senior members verbally attacking people for suggesting they not had the Lord's prayer before every session. Having grown up there, O always tell people; the landscape, geography and nature is amazing. The people are shit. \n\nBest move I ever made was escaping the place.\n\nOn one hand they'll give the penguins a few hundred square metres to get rid of free parking. On the other, the rail operators dump thousands of tons of gravel on penguins nesting areas, killing hundreds of mating pairs and... Pfffbt. Accidents happen! No penalties. They don't give a shit about the animals, it's always just *money.* Like good Evangelist Christians...",

Could stop and watch the penguins walk around and do their thing underneath at the same time. Was quite cool.",

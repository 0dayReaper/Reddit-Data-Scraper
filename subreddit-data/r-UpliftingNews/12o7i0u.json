That resulted in excess (phosphates?) Pouring right into the Everglades which fed algal blooms and cat tails (invasive weeds)\n\nFeel free to correct any of that, high school was 12 years ago and we learned all about the Florida ecosystem, extensively.",

It chronicles the crazy idea and execution of draining the Everglades and trying to control the water with canals and dykes to create real estate and farm land. I had no idea any of this happened so it was a good place to start. It is VERY fascinating but super frustrating and now I want to dive even deeper into the subject. It also talks about the early ideas of conservation by people who sensed that this was a dangerous mistake. And the Seminole people who were pushed aside by both the capitalists for development and the conservationists for the state park. I didn\u2019t know it was based on a book! Thank you Reddit! Im excited to read",

In the Everglades, native cattails (Typha species) quickly dominate wetland areas that have been disturbed or nutrient enriched, replacing the native sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense).\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/whymanageplants.htm",

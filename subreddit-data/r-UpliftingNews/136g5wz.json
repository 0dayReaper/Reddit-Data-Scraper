The British royal family have a lot of close ties with global politicians l, but with the benefit that they won't ever be voted out. Getting on Rishi Sunak's good side will pay dividends for a few years. Getting on the royal families Christmas card list could yield dividends for decades.",

Rentals are treated by old people as a retirement fund. And then the rental vacancy rate dives below 1.5% nationally\u2026 and prices soar. Australia allows rental prices to rise \u201cin proportion to the market value\u201d, so when houses are scarce, they can raise the prices higher and higher and higher, which incentivizes not making new houses, because if there are more houses then the prices, and their investment, will go down. \n\nI tried to find a rental a couple years ago. There were so many people at every viewing I couldn\u2019t physically get in the door.\n\nI\u2019m not a professional by any means, but I tried to simplify my understanding of this insane housing situation. There are many other factors, like rural housing not being viable for many or preferred, because medical access takes a nosedive if you live far away from a capital city so no one wants to live there, but you get it",

It's a bit like having a government for humans, where maybe an individual could do better without paying taxes or having to obey laws, but society-wide we'd be screwed without one. \n\nThe grazers churn and compact soil and organic material together, as well as pooping out a large amount of natural fertilizer wherever it goes, which in turn is churned and compacted into soil by other grazers' feet. They also keep the grasses in check, making sure no one species can out-compete all the others and form a disease/parasite/insect vulnerable monoculture and ensuring niche plant species necessary to soil health and rapid wildfire recovery (as well as the hosts of a variety of specialized insects, which in turn sustain birds and small mammals that spread a variety of plant seeds) are not pushed out. They, in combination with wildfires, are an important part of the circle of life in grasslands. In turn they sustain large predators and scavengers, adding further complexity to the food web. Many African grasslands are still in full glory unlike their North American counterparts, which is why you still have decent populations of some really incredible megafauna in the African savannahs.",

Instead of a herd of animals in a pasture being supplemented with farm grown food, you have a herd travelling through rangeland. \n\nTo avoid naturally occurring predator/prey population cycle imbalances, I imagine management through culling might be justified. I suppose that culling could be done through hunting.\n\nAside from humans getting tasty bison burgers though, the herds also fill an important ecological niche, contributing to the overall health of the prairie grasslands.\n\nAlso, bison hunting was an important part of indigenous culture in the prairies.

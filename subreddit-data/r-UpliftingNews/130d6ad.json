Sacraments have a \"form\" and \"substance\", and the Church believes Sacraments are instituted by Christ Himself.\n\nSo for example, for the Sacrament of the Eucharist (\"communion\") the \"form\" is the words of consecration (\"this is My Body\") and the \"substance\" is the bread and wine. This is why Catholic communion is always bread and wine - no substitutes are permitted because since Christ instituted the sacrament, the Church has no authority to change it.\n\nIn the case of Holy Orders, the \"form\" is the ritual and the words of consecration of the man, and the \"substance\" is a man. Christ was certainly capable to select women as priests - there were many holy women in his following, but He didn't. Christ was also not \"constrained by the times\", He said and did many things that went against the culture and traditions of the day (eating with prostitutes and tax collectors, \"working\" on the Sabbath, etc.). Ultimately, they killed him for it.\n\nSo, as the Church sees it, the Church has no authority to change the \"substance\" of the Sacrament of Holy Orders.",

There\u2019s solid research to show multiple women were regarded as apostles in the text. Junia and Phoebe are two of them. As well, at least two men who weren\u2019t part of the twelve are discussed in the text. The Acts account describes Matthias being selected as a replacement for Judas by casting lots (drawing straws), and Paul\u2019s status as another apostle is discussed in multiple places. Saying it was a clean cut original twelve isn\u2019t supported. \n\nHere\u2019s a scholar reliable for explaining the data as it is without tradition or dogma: [Was Junia regarded as an apostle](https://www.tiktok.com/@maklelan/video/7093123097699634478).",

She\u2019s referred to as Mary of Magdalene, which many have interpreted as \u201cfrom Magdala.\u201d The problem with this as more research is done is that Magdala didn\u2019t exist as a city until centuries after the life of Jesus of Nazareth. That leaves another interpretation for Magdalene, which also can be translated to \u201chighly regarded one\u201d or \u201cthe great.\u201d Since it can\u2019t be a reference to a place she\u2019s from since that didn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s more likely the original text to referring to her having a very highly regarded reputation. Whether or not that means she\u2019s an apostle is one thing, but muting her position over the centuries parallels the same happening with other women in the text who were directly referred to as apostles and early church fathers showed recognition for.",

Its been a seat of political power throughout most of history rather than true religion leadership. I've observed that its not the power seat in the community to be a priest like it once was in many countries like here in the UK and surprise surprise it now attracts fewer men to priesthood because of it. \n\n\nNot to mention the absolute horrors of child abuse they are still to this day trying to cover up. \n\n\nTry explaining all this to my very Catholic parents and extended family though...",

Between general anti-papist attitudes inherited from England centuries ago, and American white nationalist rhetoric that was nearly as intolerant to Jews &amp; Catholics as blacks...the Catholic control of all three branches of government after the 2020 election would have been shocking to someone in 1960 reading newspaper articles fretting over John F.

This woman kindly decided to donate the food she grew on her plot to people struggling with the cost of living as we have 10%+ inflation here in the UK. Then a bitter person salted the land.\nI don\u2019t know why the earlier comment suggested that local police may be responsible. Yes we have problems in our police forces but I can\u2019t imagine what would motivate one of them to do this",

I am not doubting you, just want to know if there is more information available about it. Admittedly, knowing that salt would ruin a field and arranging to fully salt all of the woman's fields takes forethought, planning and a bit money. And she has good grounds to sue whoever did it for damaging her property.",

By piecing together funding through a variety of grants, the state\u2019s Office of Suicide Prevention was able to stand up the program in 2018 with eight hospitals. It now includes 73 hospitals, both in cities and in rural towns, and follow-up specialists have called more than 19,000 patients.\"",

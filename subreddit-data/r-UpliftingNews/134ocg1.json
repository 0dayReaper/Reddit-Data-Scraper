Prom attire is expensive by itself, but the community also paid for a fancy dinner, a limo, and a red carpet for said limo.\n\nIt's uplifting not because special needs kids got to go to prom, it's uplifting because the community went above and beyond in doing it. Most kids, at least where I'm at, just rented a tux/dress, showed up at prom in their own cars, and drove home afterwards. Sure, some had the big limos and fancy everything, but that's not the typical experience.",

It is above t stabilizing periods of significant mental fragility, perhaps so that later on I can think about the less savory elements.",

(Now, you can argue that medical care in this country is awful so having special needs will inherently have a negative financial impact and make it harder to fund things like prom, but that's an independent issue).\n\nThis seems to be a story about economic inequality disguised as an uplifting story about kids feeling \"normal\" for a night. \n\nI am genuinely happy these kids had a great time. Everyone deserves to have a fantastic prom if that's a thing they want to do. But prom has always been about wealth and class.

The kids have special needs; nowhere does it say they're living in poverty, so instead of donating a limo and dinner for one night, how 'bout actually including them in the community? Did any of the donors ever invite one kid with special needs to a birthday party or to the beach or the amusement park? Will any of them give them a *job*? Or are they just \"unfortunates\" to donate to once and then go on living without giving these kids another thought?",

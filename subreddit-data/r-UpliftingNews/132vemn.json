And as soon as those dumb profit-focused lobbyists fuck off out of office into a funeral home, we could probably have an easier time making legislation that isn't defended by stuck up entitled boomers from a bygone era of fear. We could maybe, just maybe, treat people who use drugs as people again, and not as free space labor in prisons or as social pariahs. We could actually start giving addicts actual rehabilitation instead of a prison sentence for putting a chemical in their body. Fuck boomers and fuck their dumb rule of fear and complicity. Fuck em.",

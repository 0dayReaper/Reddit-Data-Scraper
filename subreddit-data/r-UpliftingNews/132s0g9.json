            "comment": "&gt;Existing tools predicting RNA structure use measurements of the magnetic vibration of atoms known as \u201cchemical shift data\u201d collected from a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. These methods rely on assigning chemical shift values to each atom in a given molecule, which sometimes proves impossible. Neel\u2019s computational model contains a library of possible shapes for a given RNA molecule based on its atomic structure. A statistical method assigns weights to each structure in the library, favoring structures that closely resemble experimental data. By using 2D histograms for reweighting, his model eliminates the need to assign chemical shift data.",

If you can afford the $150 upfront cost, and $30 a year in supplies, I would recommend everyone getting a under sink RO system. You end up drinking more water as it tastes better and it will clean out the lead and other nasty shit from the water supply. Remember, the lead is in the pipes and not from the municipal source. Now with pfas being linked to all sorts of cancers RO is a good way to make sure you are not slowly poisoning yourself.",

It's not a filter it's electrochemical degradation, direct electron and indirect oxidation. \n\nThis is probably more expensive per PFAS concentration than RO but let's you run a background reduction. RO on all your\"clean\" water is expensive but you could have a small system for just your actual drinking water for pretty cheap. It's all about tradeoffs.  \n\nThis feels like a pretty small finding. I doubt they didn't think it would work, but now it's better understood the parameters at play.",

At most you just need to attach a new fitting to piggyback on the cold water line running to the sink wherever you are putting it. Then it's just all those small flexible water lines which literally snap into place. Hell, depending on the brand even the filters are easy to change. Mine has push button releases so barely any water leaks out when you change them. You just hit the release, then snap the new one in place. \n\nI actually installed mine in the basement level below the kitchen and ran the lines upstairs. The tank stays nice and cool year round down there so you are getting colder than room temp water all the time.\n\nEdit: I did forget to mention the wastewater line. Typically you just drill a small hole into the sink drain pipe and attach the drain saddle these things come with. Super easy to do.",

You can also nearly cut it in half by running two membranes in parallel.  If you aren't running a pressurized system (water fills a non pressurized vessel), it will improve total efficiency, though that is impractical for many.   Mine is around to 1.5:1 in the summer.  The type of membrane and the rejection rate also plays a role.  These modifications cost about $150 give or take, so not much payback unless you make a massive amount of water.

Most people do not get a significant amount of their minerals from drinking water, so unless they are part of the small group that does rely on water for minerals, removing them doesn't have any effect on their health.

On the one hand, capsaicin has been shown to induce apoptosis in several different types of cancer cells and mechanisms have been proposed to explain its apparent anti-cancer activity. On the other hand, capsaicin also appears to act as a carcinogen in some parts of the body.\r  \nAs noted above, capsaicin has been shown to induce apoptosis or have chemoprotective actions in the laboratory in a variety of human cancer cells, including lung, pancreatic, bladder, colon, urothelial, and prostate cancer cells. Population studies have found hot pepper consumption to be associated with lower risks of lung and liver cancers. The population-based evidence with respect to colon cancer is inconsistent.\r  \nFrequent consumption of hot peppers has been found to be associated with esophageal, gall bladder and gastric (stomach and intestinal) cancers in multiple population studies. In Chileans (who have among the highest rates of gall bladder cancer in the world), those with the highest intake of red chilli peppers and a history of gallstone disease have the highest risk of developing gall bladder cancer. One Mexican study found that intake of capsaicin was associated with increased risk of gastric cancer independent of H. pylori infection. Maternal consumption of chili peppers during pregnancy has also been found to be associated with subsequent higher risk for the child of medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), a common childhood brain tumor.  \n\n\nhttps://foodforbreastcancer.com/foods/hot-peppers",

Popular from the 1920s to the mid-1950s, the product, which developed from the sailing industry in England and Scotland, became commonly used for waterproofing. It has been replaced by more modern materials but is still used by the country sports community. The main drawbacks are two: waxed fabric is not very breathable and tends to be heavier and bulkier than modern synthetic waterproof materials.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Plenty of methods can be used to accomplish this task from boiling water to something more complex and target specific like osmosis. So even if these guys found a novel way of removing these chemicals from water it's not like it's groundbreaking. \n\nThe problem with forever chemicals is destroying them. They are highly resistant to basically all forms of treatment by design and methods that currently can break them down to smaller chains or benign compounds are costly or not necessarily super effective. This is the field that people are trying to pump money into, the first guys to develop a practical and cost effective method of forever chemical breakdown will make bank as the EPA starts clamping down on waste and material regulation.",

Well here is the answer in case you're as bored as I am and will find it equally as oddly interesting. I stole it from Wikipedia :) \n\nThe province's name was chosen by\u00a0Queen Victoria, when the\u00a0Colony of British Columbia (1858\u20131866), i.e., \"the Mainland\", became a British colony in 1858.[23]\u00a0It refers to the\u00a0Columbia District, the British name for the territory drained by the\u00a0Columbia River, in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-Oregon Treaty\u00a0Columbia Department\u00a0of the\u00a0Hudson's Bay Company. Queen Victoria chose\u00a0British\u00a0Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from the United States' (\"American Columbia\" or \"Southern Columbia\"), which became the\u00a0Oregon Territory\u00a0on August 8, 1848, as a result of the treaty.[24]\n\nUltimately, the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0in the name\u00a0British Columbia\u00a0is derived from the name of the\u00a0Columbia Rediviva, an American ship which lent its name to the\u00a0Columbia River\u00a0and later the wider region;[25]\u00a0the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0in the name\u00a0Columbia Rediviva\u00a0came from\u00a0the name\u00a0Columbia\u00a0for the New World or parts thereof, a reference to\u00a0Christopher Columbus.",

The time it takes (half-lives of thousands or millions of years) depends on how long the carbon spine of the molecule is.  \n\nFiltration will remove them, but the issue is that they still exist, now just in a different place.  \n\nProcesses such as those being developed by Alclarity aim to break these large bio-accumulants back down into smaller molecules that are not harmful.",

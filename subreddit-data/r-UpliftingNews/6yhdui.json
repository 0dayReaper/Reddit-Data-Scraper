They actually managed to turn a profit in the months after 9/11 because they were small and well-liked. \n\nBack in the day they were the only airline with satellite TV, which was a big perk to my family back when we'd go to Disney with small kids frequently.",

The landing gear was stuck rotated 90 degrees, the pilot had to burn fuel and divert to LAX (took off from Burbank, CA) in order to lessen fire risk, lower the weight and use the longer runway to slow down. \n\nI think the passengers shifted to the back of the airplane so that it could remain on the back gear for longer to burn more speed. Amazing stuff.\n\nBut don't forget the time when a flight attendant said \"fuck this\" and deplaned on the tarmac with the emergency slide with a beer in hand... I think we all wish we could be him sometimes.",

He was driving to Dallas to buy furniture which he sold in an old model home park from some company that failed. He got burned by the DEA(or some other agency) for money laundering because the DEA were the only ones that would lend him money. He did community service and did an amazing above and beyond to steer at risk individuals to a better path. All the time selling furniture that really did \"save you money!\" \" Buy it today get it delivered tonight\" really happened with independent contractor drivers making a great living wage. It wasn't free delivery but it was super inexpensive by contract guys that went above and beyond too.\n\nHe hasn't abandoned anyone that is following in his footsteps. He is that really hard boss that you would work for again. I didn't, but I would. ",

                            "comment": "&gt; Not sure why this is hard to understand for some companies/people/entities. \n\n\nIt's not that they don't understand it. It's a legal issue. An detailed explanation is below but the tl;dr is if they cut the ticket price below operating cost, their shareholders could/would sue. But JetBlue held a vote and has a public statement on file to potential or current investors carving out an exception for 'corporate social responsibility'. Other companies didn't.\n\n\n____________________\nPublic companies (that is, those subject to SEC regulations and are listed on one or more stock markets) are required to disclose, and be bound by, an agreement between it and the majority of shareholders. Generally, this is called a 'mission statement', but there's no requirement to call it as such. That statement outlines how the company will conduct business. If agents of that corporation (read: executives and board members) act outside the boundaries therein, they can be subject to civil action. Read: They get the pants sued off them. \n\n\nIn situations like this, if the mission statement didn't specifically allow for this, they can't do it. Some leeway is granted if the move doesn't result in a decrease in profits for the shareholders -- ie, they can't sue unless they can prove they were harmed. If profits that meet or exceed expectation, generally nobody has a bitch about it. \n\n\nIn the case of JetBlue their *[Proxy Statement](http://blueir.investproductions.com/investor-relations/financial-information/reports/proxy-statements)* granted them the ability to do this *without* a majority vote of the shareholders; They carve out an exception for \"Corporate Social Responsibility Practices\". Were this not the case, a company that wanted to do this would have to wait until the next annual meeting where voting occurs to change this statement. \n\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, JetBlue has both a pattern, and the ability, to go beyond profit-making. They've already said they include community and volunteer work and contributions to various causes as part of their corporate mandate. As such, the CEO is empowered to spend money on this largely as they wish, unless the Board of Directors objects. \n\n\nSo it's not that companies or organizations don't understand this. It's that some of them are held to a contract that keeps them from doing this even if both the shareholders and the corporations' current agents wanted to. JetBlue planned ahead -- so they are free to act when others are not. The shareholders and agents of the company voted well before this happened that should there be a need to go above and beyond in making a community contribution, they could, even if it wasn't planned. \n\n\nThis isn't just \"good PR\" -- they publicly stated they could, and would, do things like this long before this particular disaster struck. So don't thank JetBlue *only* because they are performing a great public service, thank them too for going above and beyond making money and including social responsibility as a core value in how they conduct business *before* this happened. A lot of others didn't, and I'm certain a lot of pilots, and probably a number of CEOs for other companies, wish they could come help. It's just that the law says they can't. I don't believe any airline isn't a public corporation. \n\n\nMost people aren't aware the airline industry operates on tight margins and is a high risk investment. A lot of airlines have folded in the past -- or been bailed out by the government, and I believe all of the ones around today have, at one point or another, declared bankrupcy. Investors are right to be wary and any who do invest are certainly looking at every expenditure and seeing to it that it is an economizing choice. Other companies have stepped forward to increase flights in and out of the area, and cut their ticket prices down so there's no profit -- but they can't cut it as low as JetBlue did because operating in the red would put their balls in a vice from angry shareholders. \n\n",

It is me, my spouse, and two small children. Fort Lauderdale to WA D.C.? Sold out. To Boston? Sold out. From Orlando, a short three hour drive? Sold out. Where are these tickets??\n\nEdit: RIP my inbox. The generosity of people on here always surprises me. My post was meant to convey that despite what is being reported about the JetBlue fares, they don't seem to exist. For reasons difficult to explain, my options are fly my family out or hunker down here. I would have much preferred fly out, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards. I cannot believe how many of you responded with offers of a free place to stay or points to use at a hotel. Other than a couple of random people writing things like \"you're just looking for handouts,\" most of the messages I got were for offers of help. Thank you so much for restoring my faith in humanity. I have the means to pay for a hotel, but thank you so very much to all who offered a lending hand. ",

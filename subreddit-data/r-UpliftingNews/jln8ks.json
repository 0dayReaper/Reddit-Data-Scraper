Couldn't handle coming out, they used his boyfriends sister house to have dates so nobody would see he was gay. He moved back to Colorado where his ex boyfriend still wrote him, but he himself never responded to the letters. Joined a church, met a woman, had a daughter. Marriage didn't last and raised his daughter alone. He spent the last 40 years so far, single and lonely.",

It's even pretty common for some people to stay in a relationship out of love, and maybe open things up. Sometimes that fails.\n\nLove is complicated. I know.

He did have a secret boyfriend for a few years, the true love of his life, but he left him (they never saw each other again, and his ex passed a few years ago, but after spending several decades with a another man he loved). He did marry a women and have a daughter with her; his wife left a few years after, but it seemed more like it was because they were both older, rushed into the marriage, and weren't really compatible even without regarding his sexuality. He never really found anyone else (though he did go on a date recently), but it sounds as though his daughter (who also happens to be gay) gave/gives him much of the fulfillment he needed in life. It is sad that it took so long for him to be true to himself, but he seems to be really embracing his true self now, and the world's embracing him for it. Another silver lining; because of the widespread coverage of his story, young lgbt+ people from around the world are reaching out to him and seeking advice.",

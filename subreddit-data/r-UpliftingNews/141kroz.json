It's gonna help the USA for years and years and years to come as long as no administration's stop it if they gain power. \n\nClean energy, infrastructure spending including new bridges and shit. We NEEEEEEED this stuff across the land. \n\nIt's exciting! I mean I would have loved for him to back the railway unions or literally help us in any way meaningful. But this massive spending will definitely offer opportunity to people as well as bring money into the things we should be focusing on like renewable energy.",

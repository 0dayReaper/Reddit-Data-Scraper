It\u2019s difficult for others to imagine just how bad it can get, and that includes others with similar/same conditions that do not have the same severity or are responding well to/have access to treatment. I have also seen it turn fatal (a lovely lady in my support group succumbed to complications of Crohn\u2019s.) I personally am not at the mental point where I share your feeling, but I will always leave the option open in my mind, because you never know and I absolutely want that choice over my own life.\n\nCrohn\u2019s and UC are absolutely devastating to leading a typical life for many, and anyone who doesn\u2019t have first hand experience would do well to not opine on your choices. Solidarity and respect, friend, but I do hope things improve (and if not, your life is your own. You should have the right to that choice.)",

Crohn\u2019s is serious business (and geez, it should be common knowledge with doctors that IBD can present with either diarrhea OR constipation, or revolve between both sometimes!) and it does seem like there\u2019s a lack of proper protocol surrounding IBD in general. It took me several years, six doctors, an emergency surgery, and two incorrect diagnoses to land at UP. Even with gastroenterologists, which are hard for some people to get into in the first place, there\u2019s so much that\u2019s misunderstood and that leads to a gap in adequate care.

Once someone\u2019s treatment cannot go any further, isn\u2019t showing results, or the person can\u2019t tolerate it any longer, it\u2019s more compassionate to stop treatment, help them put affairs in order, and let them go as comfortably as possible if that\u2019s what they wish for. For some this can include euthanasia, but it\u2019s not a choice made lightly by anyone or without a lot of forethought and care, and it\u2019s not a choice offered outside of dire circumstances. Having agency over the end of treatment or end of life is just as\u2014or even more\u2014important as having agency over the course of it.",

They don't issue a title, just registration, and your local DMV will accept that registration and issue you a title. Maybe. You may have to argue about it.\n\n\n You'll need a bill of sale for the car, some paperwork, and some taxes and fees. You'll mail all of this in. This will not solve a stolen car or a car with a lien. \n\nThey also give you Vermont plates, so you can just drive the vehicle while you argue with the DMV. \n\nPlease do your own research before attempting this.",

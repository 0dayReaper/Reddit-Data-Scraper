I recently lost 2 screws for a children's bed from Ikea i have had it taken apart when the first child no longer needed it, and then i couldn't find a few screws. I didn't even buy the thing, but got it second hand and it is at least 5 years old. All i had to do was find the manual on their website, in there i found the part number for the screw. With that in hand, they have a nice form to request any such small missing parts. I got them in the mail a week later, no questions asked, no cost to me.",

NATO will present Ukraine with a road map plan with terms and conditions that they will have to deal with in order to become a member.  Besides the original team, new member states have taken anywhere from 5-10 years to meet all these terms.\n\nSweden and Finland were very unique because they sort of met most of the terms already and typically the sort of stuff they were asked to do would be done privately... but in this case it was all made very public.  Finland was able to meet the terms and ascended into NATO and Sweden could not and isn't.  And these are two perfectly capable militaries with strong democratic institutions and strong economies.\n\nUkraine on the other hand has none of these things.  And the war has basically made all the worse things about the country worse.  Zelenskyy has been taking the opportunity to try and crush out corruption that is impacting the war.... but not so much corruption in other parts of the government.\n\nIt won't just be that Zelenskyy has to do this, but whoever becomes next president will have to do this.  And it's going to be a long path.  And it's going to be one where foreign accountability is going to come into Ukraine and make sure everything is on the up and up.  If Ukraine agrees to this process it'll be overall good for the country.  But whose to say oligarchs won't come in and install someone who is opposed to NATO?",

So no admission if you have an ongoing conflict. Like the Donbas war Ukraine had before 2022.\n\nWhen this war with Russia ends, Ukraine might be faced with making some really hard choices over joining NATO.",

This would give NATO the ability to launch a nuclear weapon which targeted either Moscow or their nuclear sites without the possibility of Russian retaliation.\n\n(Benjamin, M., &amp; Davies, N. J.

Russia similarly has subs and bombers dispersed over tens of thousands of miles that would be able to launch a devastating counter attack if Moscow was destroyed. \n\nAll the talk of Russia being threatened by an autonomous or western-leaning Ukraine is just a red herring. Russia colonized and tried to dominate Ukraine for generations, and they\u2019re having a tantrum that they can\u2019t continue doing so. It\u2019s about as simple as that. Ukraine has never been a threat to Russia, Russia has for hundreds of years been a threat to ukraine. \n\nIt very similar to the French trying to dominate Algeria. Only naked greed for power and an outdated assumption that they were entitled to colonize another people motivated the French to oppose an independent Algeria. If they could have invented some nuclear boogie man like the Russians are trying, they would have. It\u2019s all just rationalizing injustice.",

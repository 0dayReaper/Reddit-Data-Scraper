This doesn't mean that ALL people from A live longer than people in B, or that there aren't people in B who lived longer than most in A (or vice versa, people in A who does very young).  Then you can investigate the cause.\n\nBut in this scenario, we're looking at chance.  This is one of the people from region B that lived very long.  Does that mean that he was doing anything different than most in B, it just means he was \"lucky\". Outliers are generally expected.  But the question is, how many people did exactly what this person did but died young either in spite or because of it?\n\nAssuming that this person has the answers to longevity is survivorship bias.  You would think, well, logically, he must! But that's not necessarily true, because we're not comparing it to everything that other people who lived long have done, or even if it was different from most of the people who didn't.  Unless this person's longevity can be consistently reproduced, it's probably just chance.\n\nAnd after smoking for 20 years, I'm putting my money on chance.",

The number of survivors would approximately halve, with the approximation probably better for the earlier rounds, but it\u2019s far from a given that there\u2019d be 14 rounds (and it might never end). If they\u2019d had 100,000 vs 100,000 (one in each pair calls a flip) it would always keep halving \u2014 perhaps that\u2019s what they meant (it\u2019s what I assumed they meant initially, though obviously didn\u2019t scan properly)",

In life you have a large variety of choices you can make, some of which are heavily affected by chance some of them not at all. At coin flipping you are only doing one thing, which is entirely based on chance, at least if you\u2019re not cheating.\n\nTherefore it\u2019s not only survivorship bias. Yes, you need to win the lottery to stay alive that long, but we\u2019re not looking at a random person here. We\u2019re looking at the person who lived longer than 99,99% others. This means it\u2019s quite probable that the person made better life choices than most others.\n\nIf you\u2019re not convinced, you can think about a coin flipping tournament, where some people are cheating. For convenience, you can assign them a cheating value of 1 to 10, people with 10 being the most successful cheaters. At the end of the tournament, no matter who wins, the cheating value of the winner will likely be higher than the average cheating value.\n\nThat of course is not completely true, because it depends on how the cheating value is defined. But let\u2019s say people are randomly assigned a cheating value at the beginning, and that people A and B with cheating values of a and b have the odds of (50 + a - b)% and (50 - a + b)% of winning respectively. If you have the difference of cheating values of 3, it means the odds of winning are 53% and 47% for example.",

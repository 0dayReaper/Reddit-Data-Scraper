The men were given steady jobs so they wouldn\u2019t turn to poaching, and it ended up being a huge help for the organizations hiring them. The ex-poachers knew where popular trapping sites were, and also knew how to find and track tigers. ",

Either the ex-poachers become excellent deterrents, using 'insider knowledge' to best scupper the poaching raids and traps set by fellow locals, thus helping conserve the species they previously targeted. \n\nAlternatively, and more worryingly, you find they accept the steady pay, and **just keep poaching anyway**. The lure of the additional income is still very strong, corruption is rife, and their poaching success is, if anything, now helped further by access to inside information on the inner workings of the anti-poaching initiatives (patrol routes etc.). Why settle for one moneys, when you can have two? \n\nDepending on circumstances, locale and even individuals involved, though it may sound like a good idea, effectively paying poachers off can actually make the situation worse.

Well, that might help, but i) there's still an awful lot of financial temptation and, far more importantly ii) who's going to pay for them? Conservation bodies hire locals for many reasons, one of which is because *they're cheap* (and you can therefore pay for more of them!).\n\nAnd then there are other problems with sending foreigners over. Not only are they going to be prohibitively expensive, but you're going to find significantly less support from the local community (whose involvement is *vital* for conservation initiatives to work. These are the people you want to convert to the good cause, after all) and fosters more of a 'us vs. them' mentality. When many of these regions are post-colonial with associated sentiments still very much present, a situation where armed foreigners suddenly take over the forest you've been hunting in all your life (to, y'know, survive), preventing you from feeding your family, it's easy to see how things might get ugly.

Bearing in mind, *even if you're caught*, your fine may be as little as $13. Do you say no?!\n\nOf course not. Money wins (almost) every time. Thankfully there are still some people with integrity, and I've known of individuals who've turned down more money than they might make in a lifetime to keep protecting their charges.

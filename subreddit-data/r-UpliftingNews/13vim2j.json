The manager said this incident was \"the very reason why residents are prohibited from raising pets\".\n\n&gt;Shifu's owner has been fined 1,000 baht (S$38.94) and promised to move Shifu to a relative's home, The Nation reported.\n\n* Great survival skills by Master Shifu. \n\n\n* And the condominium manager had to one-up everything in the end.",

There's a weird myth spread on reddit about this as if they're immune to death or injury by falling. Cats get injured and die from long falls all the time, they're just no more likely to die or be injured from a 20 story fall than they are from a 5 story fall, which helps their chances of surviving overall. And they're more likely to survive a fall than a fire, hence why it's better to toss them out a window if that's your only option. But they can still get injured or die from falls.",

Survival rate is 95% (that make it to vet) which is not saying they aren't hurt. It is obviously much better if your cat doesn't fall out of a skyscraper. It is a very cool fact that they can even do that though, and if they are falling on dirt instead of concrete you have to imagine they are virtually unharmed. Very cool survival tactic.\n\nMy point was less that the cats aren't in a small amount of danger, and more that this person is choosing to take a benign story with a obviously happy ending and paint the situation as horrible and the owner is negligent.\n\nThank you for the clarification though, I clearly read the statistics incorrectly before posting.",

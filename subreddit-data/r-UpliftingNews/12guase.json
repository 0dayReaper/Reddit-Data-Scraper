Organ that has been transplanted once would not pass the health requirements for transplant again IMO",

It is quite rare and definitely not normal or routine practice right now. \n\nI was thinking about it from the assumption that the patient has had the organ for a long time, which will render the organ unlikely to be healthy enough to pass transplant requirements. I was not thinking about the scenario that patient died from other causes within weeks after receiving it and that the organ was still healthy.\n\nPS: This is reddit, of course people can post opinions if they want.",

But recovery is not a happy go lucky walk in the park for everyone, like so many articles and comments tend to insinuate. Surgery was 3 hours long, but you're put under anesthesia of course. My hospital stay was 4 days because the pain from the remaining gas they pumped me with was pretty brutal. The incision itself barely hurt at all. There was also a lot of nausea due to the anesthesia. I was definitely moving slow and sore for the first week, but at about 2 weeks I was driving again. Anyways, what I'm saying is that it's not an easy recovery for a lot of people, but I would do it 100 times over. I get to wave goodbye to my friend at the airport while she visits family, instead of bringing flowers to her grave this year.",

He basically was on his death bed before we found a fantastic doctor that saved him. He was only 19 at this point.\n\nBetween diagnosis and transplant, he had multiple heart attacks, blood transfusions, chemotherapy and radiation to name a few. He was almost in complete kidney failure and that's when the doctors recommended transplant surgery. I remember my brother asking me if I would be willing to donate and I said 'FUCK YES!!' In fact, we were a perfect match. I made sure he knew that no matter what happens, I am honored to finally give him a chance at a healthier future. \n\nThat was in 2020 and since then he'd had a couple scares with his heart (lupus attacks different organs) to include wearing a heart monitor for 2 months. Mind you, my brother was very active and loved playing sports so even with this terrible inconvenience, he still smiled!! \n\nHe eventually passed away from a heart attack while playing basketball with his son. I will never forget the day he left this earth and I don't want to ever feel that pain again but in this life, it is inevitable. \n\nI don't know your friends situation but just tell her to keep fighting. Keep smiling because no matter what, her life is just as precious as the rest of us. I'm sending all the good vibes her way.",

But, trying to find a 2-3 month lease in Vancouver near the hospital was difficult and... expensive. Not to mention all accommodations are jacked to an outrageous premium in the vicinity of the hospital because landlords prey on the desperate and vulnerable. \n\nWe managed to land a brand new condo with a stunning view for  like 5% more than the price of a shitty ground level suite that was gross and depressing.

            "comment": "Donate life, y'all! There are three major ways you can do that, if anyone is interested. Blood donation, bone marrow cell donation (generally between ages 18 and 35), and organ/tissue donation (which is the actual official \"Donate Life\" organization, but let's be honest you're doing so with all of these). \n\n1. Donate blood\n\nThere's an urgent need for blood donors! This isn't just for full blood donations either - platelets and plasma are also needed. You can look up where to give blood in the US through the Red Cross here:\n\nhttps://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html\n\n2. Marrow cell donation to help blood cancer patients!\n\nhttps://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-bone-marrow/join-the-marrow-registry/\n\nBone marrow (or peripheral blood stem cell) donation just requires a quick and easy swab to get on the registry for. The procedure itself takes one of two forms. The first method involves getting the cells from your blood (peripheral blood stem cells), which is basically akin to donating platelets. Sometimes getting the needed donation does require going into the bone, but that is done under anesthesia (I don't know about y'all, but I got this impression from an episode of Grey's Anatomy that there's no anesthesia and that's not the case! don't listen to TV y'all).\n\n3. Become an organ and/or tissue donor\n\nThere are two types of organ donors. The first type is what is in this article: live donation. There's a huge need for kidney donors (seriously, the backlog for all organ donation needs is just incredibly long) and if you're one of the awesome folks interested in donating you can always go on here to find out how to donate a kidney in the US. (International folks, a quick search engine check should pull up yours!)\n\nhttps://www.kidney.org/transplantation/how-to-donate\n\nYou can also do a live donation of part of your liver. This is much less common and I couldn't find any sites on how to start the process of volunteering for that.\n\nThe second type of organ donation is the one that is better known and is performed after you have passed away.\n\nIf you're interested and in the US or I think Canada, you can register to become an organ or tissue donor here:\nhttps://www.donatelife.net/register/\n\nI really like the name - donate life. Because that's what you're doing. With organ donation you're literally keeping someone from dying. But even with tissue donation (which has much less rigorous requirements) you're donating a better life. My mom, for instance, received some tendon to help her be able to walk on her foot again. Sure, she wouldn't have died without it, but her quality of life is much better this way.\n\nYou can also specify what you want to be donated. So if you, for instance, don't feel comfortable with your heart being donated, or your cornea or something, you can say that when you register and they do respect your wishes. I volunteered with them, so if you've got questions about the process I'm happy to answer.\n\n(If this looks like a repost of another comment, by the way, that's because it is. I share this information so often that I started using one detailed description for the whole thing. I hope it encourages y'all to act!)",

All because of the difference between a check box to say \"yes I want to be a donor\" and you otherwise being considered to say no, versus one with a box to say \"no I don't want to be a donor\" and you otherwise being considered to say yes.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428836/",

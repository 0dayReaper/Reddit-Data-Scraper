                    "comment": "Absolutely.\n\nWe've got a major problem in the American justice system, and one of the things I find most frustrating is the willingness to continue doing the same things in the same way, followed by empty, meaningless words like \"I'm sorry,\" after we continue getting the same results: Innocent people losing half their lives for crimes they didn't commit.\n\nLimited immunity is one of the strongholds that must come down before we can see any real change.  \n\nWhile I never pretend to be friendly toward policing in America, I'm also the first to say I believe they have the right to defend themselves even to the point of taking the life of a perpetrator, if the officer's life is in jeopardy.  They put their lives on the line daily, against a criminal element that has become outlandishly brazen, calculating, cold, and heartless. And they deserve every protection that can be afforded in the fight against the crime waves engulfing too many of our cities.\n\nThat said, I also want to see them stripped of their immunity, when there is clear and convincing evidence of wrongdoing on their part.  Beating handcuffed suspects (did you see the one where the officer attacked a man on a stretcher as he was being loaded into an ambulance)? Colluding with legal personnel and/or other persons or personnel to introduce deception into a case they believe to be going unfavorably to their position, brutalizing perpertrators and/or public citizens, engaging in sexual activity with prisoners en route to lock-up or otherwise (after a witness related the story of an officer having sex with her while she was handcuffed in the backseat of the patrol car as his partner drove them to get her logged into holding, the determination was made that \"while it may be unsavory, it is not illegal.\" Because (of course), \"it was consensual\"?!?!), intimidating witnesses, setting dogs on cooperative or subdued suspects (this tactic is often used to avoid accusations of brutality, despite the life-altering damage from the viciousness of the police dog attack); several suspects end up in wheelchairs after having their spines, esophagus, leg or arm muscles, or intestines ripped - handicapped or mained for life even though they were seated, lying down, and no longer a flight risk.   \nPerpetrating fraud, planting and/orwithholding evidence, lying under oath, provoking and escalating small infractions to felony level - any actions that shock the conscience of a reasonable and intelligent person viewing recorded actions of the officer, and willing to speak on the unadulterated difference between right and wrong.\n\nAny time there's incontrovertible video-taped evidence of police misconduct that gets tossed over and over again with the simple words \"I feared for my life,\" despite the suspect or agrieved party having no weapon and offering no life-threatning force against arrest, there's a problem.  Not only with policing, but with citizens who can watch this type of conduct play out over and over and still excuse it away as justifiable,  because it's not happening to them or to anyone they love.\n\nThe racial element is a ball of wax far too enmeshed in policing in America to even try to address here.  Racial profiling that ends in arrest and/or death should void immunity.  Instead, we've got video after video of law enforcement officers blatantly lying to affect an arrest, only to end with no charges to the suspect, and as a result, many of them losing their jobs, custody of their children, vehicles, money, and even their homes.  The inequality of these type situations comes in when you see just as many of the same incidents with far more despicable treatment of the officers, end in nothing more than a verbal warning.  I've even seen several YouTube videos where the suspect ran from the officer, took fists to him after the officer chased the suspect all the way to his house, and for several minutes, tried to take away the officer's weapon! Yet, it ended with the officer walking away - no detaining or arrest of the suspect, no call for backup.  Over and over again you see them quarrel, explain, and discuss situations with enraged  White offenders, while rarely extending any opportunity for this kind of interaction with Black &amp; Brown suspects.\n\nGenerally, police are protected in all of these incidents and others.   And when there is a monetary award following poor policing, the taxpaper pays - not the police, removing any incentive for change within the ranks.\n\nImmunity needs to be amended to cover only acts committed by officers in the necessity of saving his or her own life, or the life of innocent bystanders who would otherwise be harmed or killed.  But the buck-wild, teflon don robe that has been established by immunity, only serves to create a divide between police and the general public that is quickly becoming irrevocable.  And the time for change has come, before we reach a point of no return.\n\nPolice need the freedom to do their jobs effectively, again, even to the point of killing a suspect who is an imminent threat to their lives.  But that freedom should never include acting as judge, jury and executioner.  The optics, the spirit, and the resulting blowback dismantles any sense of safety or respect from anyone who clearly understands that at any time, they can easily become the next casualty of a statute that is causing more harm than good.",

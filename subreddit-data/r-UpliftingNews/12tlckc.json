Even if you set aside the \u201cAmerica bad\u201d rhetoric, we don\u2019t have much of a democracy at all. Sure we can vote for our representatives, but that\u2019s pretty much it. We don\u2019t really choose who those representatives are, and once they\u2019re elected we have no control over them or anything they do. We can\u2019t recall them or remove them from office. If they do things we don\u2019t like then our only option is to hope they don\u2019t get re-elected. Participation in the governmental system is effectively barred from everyone unless you\u2019re wealthy enough to be able to campaign. Even if you can support yourself through a campaign, the campaigns cost ludicrous amounts of money and are realistically impossible to win without wealthy donors backing you. We, as the people, can\u2019t propose policies or control what policies are being proposed. We have no effect at all on whether policies are being passed or not. I mean the average American has absolutely zero political power. It\u2019s only a democracy for the wealthiest of us.",

I don't mind it, I'm used to it and appreciate the downtime from electronics and being able to just take in all of the natural beauty. I'm not knocking it, I'm just saying it since we're on the topic of their power grid.",

There are isolated triumphs, however I can't help but notice a lot of issues back home that make me incredulous about considering it a developed country.\n\nCosta Rica is currently at a political crossroads (which most of Central America has already crossed), with an elected president that very much resembles other populist leaders like Bolsonaro and Trump. Narrowly avoided electing an evangelist leader as president about 6 years ago, which would have been a major disaster in women's rights. \n\nRoad infrastructure is an unmitigated, nearly unfixable disaster; the Central Valley (which contains the 4 densest cities) was never designed to sustain circulation of almost as many cars as there's people. Public transportation is also a veritable fuckfest; taxi companies are nothing short of mafias, each bus route is concessioned to private companies, and god forbid suggesting that the state should be in charge of public transportation because \"the state has proven time and again that they're terrible administrators\" (then demand more of them!).\n\n One of the worst issues is that people have been slowly indoctrinated into hating public institutions that have done a lot for the country, especially in the energy side; they say now they hate the ICE (Costarican Institute of Electricity) because of the blackouts and incidental internet issues, but forget the 98% coverage of services, plus their efforts for sustainable energy, including sustainable dams that are designed to affect the surrounding environment as little as possible. They say the hate RECOPE (Costarican Refinery of Petroleum) for keeping a \"monopoly\" of gas, when what they have done is actually keep prices on check for the local gas stations; would be MUCH worse without it , but people can't see further than their own nose.\n\nPotential? There is potential. I can't think of my mother land as developed yet. Especially not now.",

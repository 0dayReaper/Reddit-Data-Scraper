If you care about whether it swings, it does not. \n\nI think other animals would probably consider us to have fucking weirdo penises, because we have no dork, but they\u2019re much bigger than other primates\u2019 and are designed for face to face sex. Probably more of a specialized tool than most animals\u2019",

This analogy doesn't work because non-human animals don't possess symbolic reasoning capacity to formulate, assign, perform or even comprehend the human-defined cultural construct of gender.\n\nThe role this lioness assumed in the pride has shifted to a leadership position, which is usually taken on by male lions, but that's it. It's nothing more than a stress response specific to this particular species' social behavior and group hierarchy structure, as dictated by their biology. Lions are social animals, and the pride needs a member in the leader role so it doesn't disintegrate.\n\nCases like this aren't even super rare. They're part of a natural process, so much so that even the lioness' bodily functions and associated behavior undergo changes to make her the best suited for the position. It's a phenomenon completely unrelated to human cultural notions, and can't be interpreted in any meaningful way under those optics.",

I think it was far more general then they state as well. Male lions hunt through ambush rather then through group tactics that the lionesses often use. They are larger and heavier so it makes more sense to adopt this strategy for them. In order to ambush something you need to be in an area where it is hard for you to be seen. Being in an area where it is hard for you to be seen also makes it hard for humans to see you hunting.",

Obviously there are bachelor lions who don't starve to death so it was known that male lions hunt as well, and as you mentioned male lions occasionally will assist female lions in their hunts. The question has always been who does the majority of the hunting. The previous school of thought was that the females do the majority of the hunting based on I believe observations of group hunts (both during the day and during the night) which were majority female with the occasional help from male lions. The new school of thought is less that lions hunt at night, but rather that male lions do a significant amount of hunting on their own through ambush tactics rather then group tactics and that the idea of the lioness doing the majority of the hunting is flawed and biased due to their hunting being very obvious and the male lions method of hunting being very hard to observe.\n\nSo it isn't fairly black and white either, that is the whole point.",

In the late 19th and early 20th  \n centuries, pioneering biologists and zoologists recorded numerous   \ninstances of same-sex behaviour in animals. According to a comprehensive   \nreview of scientific literature, as many as 1,500 species have been   \ndocumented engaging in same-sex behaviour. For example, a 2010 study   \npublished in the journal \"Biology Letters\" found that same-sex behaviour   \nhad been observed in more than 85 species of mammals, including   \nprimates, ungulates, and carnivores. In addition, same-sex behaviour has   \nbeen documented in numerous bird species, including penguins, swans, and  \n gulls. Many of these species also exhibit pair bonding and same-sex   \nparenting behaviors, such as adoption of offspring or joint nesting.  \n\n\nIn spite of this reluctance, some biologists and zoologists did speak   \nout about their observations. For instance, Frank Beach, a prominent   \nanimal behaviorist, noted in his book \"Animal Homosexuality: A Biosocial  \n Perspective\" that same-sex behavior is common in many animal species,   \nincluding primates, birds, and fish. He argued that this behavior was   \nnot a result of human influence, but rather an intrinsic part of animal   \nbehavior and evolution.",

It says it\u2019s following the death of the male lion but I wonder what exactly causes it, since it\u2019s so rare. Also how they ruled out it being an endocrine response to some other stress, old age (it\u2019s a geriatric lioness), change in feeding, climate change, some disease that overstimulates the production of masculinising hormones. Oh, and how that affects the animal\u2019s well being.\n\nIt sounds so fascinating that something so rare happens.",

We were absolutely caught off guard as 1 WTF and 2 Theres a zoo here??? So we looked it up and sure enough we drove past it almsot DAILY. And just never realized it was a zoo because we were so spoiled by Omahas. Even attempting to goto a small city zoo when youve gone to Omahas for so long is such a disappointment lol",

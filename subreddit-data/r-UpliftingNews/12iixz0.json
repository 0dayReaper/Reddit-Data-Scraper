It will depend on your provider, but most 401k providers expect you to immediately pay off your loan if you leave your job - whether voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\nLike if your job lays you off, you suddenly owe the ENTIRE balance back to your 401k. IMMEDIATELY. Right when you lose your source of income.\n\nOr else you'll eat tons of penalties.\n\n~~~\n\n{edit: so let's add a super simplistic example for easy calcs. Let's say you borrowed $50k as a 401k loan and your 401k provider says you have to pay it back immediately upon separation from  your company. Your company lays you off. Let's see what you'd owe if you can't come up with $50k on super short notice to pay back your loan.\n\nWell, adding $50k to your income probably puts most of that income in the 24% tax brackets if you're a single filer. 24% of $50k is $12,000 of taxes that you'll owe this year on top of your normal taxes.\n\nBut wait, there's more! You'll also owe a 10% early withdrawal penalty on your 401k. So that's an additional $5k.\n\nAdd that up and that's **$17k that you now owe the IRS** because you couldn't come up with the $50k to immediately pay back your 401k loan.\n\nYou could potentially get on a payment plan with the IRS, but they're not a CC company. They won't cut the amount you owe - they just let you pay it back over a longer period of time. You still owe it.}",

It's definitely nice to have that option available, but it's important to understand the implications.  For example if you're sufficiently unlucky, you could be pulling money out of your 401k at the bottom of the market and putting money into a house at the top of  the market.  It's not a likely combination of circumstances, especially over longer timescales, but those variables should be considered.  A more likely scenario is suppose you take out a 401k loan to buy a house, lose your job, and then maybe sell at a loss while being out of work for a while and still struggling to either pay back the loan or else trigger whatever tax plus penalties result from not staying on the loan payment schedule.",

Unless you absolutely need the money and have literally no other options, you should not touch your 401k, even borrowing from it. \n\nYou stop earning interest and/or reduce your balance by a not-insignificant amount. It might not seem like much now, but doing this in your prime saving years can effectively make your 401K worthless when you actually need it.",

Whether or not this benefits you is hugely dependent on your specific situation.\n\nYou cab only deduct a maximum of 10k in state and local taxes (which includes property taxes). Your mortgage deduction is on the interest you pay on the loan each year. The only tax benefit you get is for the amount you spend on the 10k state and local tax deduction and mortgage interest above the standard deduction (~25k). \n\n\nSo let's say you spend 8k on property taxes and 20k on interest. You'd increase your deduction by 3k, so you'd save your marginal tax rate ~20% times 3,000, so only about $600/year. \n \n\nIt really adds up to meaningful savings only if you're buying a very expensive home, even at current interest rates. For instance: a 400k loan @ 6.7% only yields 21k in interest year 1, still less than the standard deduction.",

So it's wise to be saving on your own regardless of what happens with social security.",

As you earn more, bump it and you still won't notice. But when you're 60 you'll be in a great spot.\"\n\nNow, everything points at a 'standard' starting contribution of 15%. \n\nConsidering COL increases, inflation in general, and a stagnation in pay raises... Stuffing 15% gross salary away for a 18-22 year old is absolutely crippling. It's fucking overkill. \n\nI'd imagine that the vast majority have zero clue how to access their accounts and adjust. Those that can are ashamed and would rather just deal with the cash problems now so long as they can retire.\n\nI would never advocate against aggressively saving for retirement.

General rule is contribute up to company match, as the % the company contributes is basically free money as long as you vest. So many companies might have a 2-5% match, so if you put 5% in they would add 5%\\~. Of course you should contribute more as you can, but normally the minimum is contributing up to your company match.\n\nStill, 5% starting at age 18-22 is huge as you have many more years to compound over someone contributing 15% at age 30-35\\~",

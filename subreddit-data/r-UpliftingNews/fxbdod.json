I remember having 9/11 overload and i didn\u2019t think anything of it then but most scripted shows, especially the kind a 17 year old watch didn\u2019t go there. At all.  Looking back I\u2019m really glad they didn\u2019t because scripted shows are for many people a time out from reality and I know it helped my mental health to escape even for just 30 minutes and I bet it was that way for a lot of other people as well. Aside from emergency services shows like Grey\u2019s Anatomy I bet pandemic plots will be avoided like the plague.",

He will donate 100M to food pantries all over the country, but Whole Foods won't offer paid leave or hazard pay to its employees. Microsoft isn't trying to alleviate world hunger, Bill Gates is. \n\nPhilanthropy at this level is, at it's core, ego driven. Perry, Bezos, and Gates know how to spend their money, how to divvy it up best, and they'll be damned if they let the government allocate it for them. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's great that they're generous and the recipients surely don't care that it's ego driven. But they never seem to consider running their companies in a way that would alleviate the need for their generosity. Or supporting progressive polices that would tax them.",

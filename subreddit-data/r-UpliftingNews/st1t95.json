Everyone seems happier. \n\nI think it\u2019s more about treating employees like responsible human beings than the number of days. We don\u2019t have set work hours and offer unlimited PTO.

The issue i can see is that it might be hard to prove that an employer fired you for requesting a 4-day work week, but this is the case for all other illegal reasons for which someone might be fired.",

Even as a teenager when I worked for McDonalds I never felt that I was going to get fired of they called me during off hours.",

But they need to contact me first and have my approval.\n\nThey became really stalky. Sometimes calling me 5 times in a row. Got fed up with it, and told them I a retracting my phone number and it was to be removed from all systems. They had to do so in accordance to our privacy laws. From then on, email contact only. When I am not at work, I ignore their emails completely\n\nSuffice to say, they were not amused. But they can't do jack shit about it.",

If there are people out there who'd rather get everything done like this, I'm glad they have the option to do so now. More flexibility in how you spend your current working hours is still good.",

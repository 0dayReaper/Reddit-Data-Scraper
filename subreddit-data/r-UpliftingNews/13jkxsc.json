Or the fact he's finally doing it? \n\n\"Society failed another hard working man as he JUST NOW is able to get his degree, but oh no, you thought, it's actually more difficult even STILL and he must also FLY to school to improve his material conditions that should have been met 20+ years earlier if not  for the failure of society\" \n\nLike I said I MAY just be cynical because... America. But I love this sub for pick me ups and happy things, but this sub and wholesome get spammed alot... how is this uplifting? I am happy for the dude, but I'm depressed his kids are gonna have it even harder than HE DID lol. AND the fact he had to put him life on hold.. like this isn't uplifting in multiple ways :/",

He could easily have gone on with his life, without a degree (in sociology), but he felt compelled to complete his degree as a personal goal, and the community around him supported him.\n\nI think it takes a lot of courage for a 50 year old man to attend university alongside kids 30 years his junior, and I think the path the took and his resolution, as well as the support that he received is touching.",

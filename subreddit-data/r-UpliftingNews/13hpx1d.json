Did they release her manifesto and no one reported on it? Because the one thing that is confirmed is that she had picked multiple targets and decided on that one because of light security, so it seems her attending in the past is irrelevant. I mean if you go on CNN people are constantly saying that trans people are being literally murdered everywhere and that isn't supported by statistics at all. But you do you and keep starting shit on what is supposed to be a positive subreddit.",

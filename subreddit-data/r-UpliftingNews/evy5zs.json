You can achieve a [wonderful effect](https://www.outsidepride.com/images/products/detail/miniclover/minicloverlandscape.jpg) with mini-clover. \n\n&gt;*[Miniclover\u00ae](https://www.outsidepride.com/seed/clover-seed/miniclover.html) (Trifolium repens) is a perennial white clover only growing to approximately 4 - 6 inches tall making it ideal for a lawn alternative or to mix with your current lawn grass. It also works great as a natural fertilizer similarly to other dwarf, small leaved, microclovers. White clover takes nitrogen out of the air, bringing this most essential fertilizer \"down-to-earth\" by means of nitrogen-fixing bacteria living in nodes along the roots. Of course, all at no cost to you, in terms either of money or of maintenance. Miniclover\u00ae, a very small leaved white clover, also produces stolons so that it can spread itself evenly over the ground. Adding just 2 - 5% of Miniclover\u00ae to the grass seed mixture will result in a much-improved lawn. It has all the benefits of regular white clover just packed into smaller leaves. Miniclover's ability to pull nitrogen from the air and fix or convert it to a usable form by the plants makes it a great companion for turf grass varieties just. This is due to nitrogen fixation benefiting the turf grass plants as well producing a healthy, dense, and naturally fertilized clover lawn that will require very little fertilizer maintenance. The dense clover growth alongside the growth of the turf grass will force out existing weeds as well as prevent the establishment of new weeds. In addition, Miniclover\u00ae is very tolerant to low mowing heights so if this microclover is not dwarf enough you can easily mow it down to achieve the perfect clover lawn. Miniclover\u00ae is very low maintenance and it helps to carry this characteristic to what ever it may be planted with. Miniclover\u00ae will flower once a year in the summer for about 1 month if it is not mowed. Great lawn alternative!",

It doesn't look as neat as a normal lawn but it stayed green through the summer while the rest of my lawn didn't. It's really soft to walk through and holds up much better to kids running around in sprinklers. Early on I still had to mow like normal but once it established it pretty much evened out and didn't need much work.\n\nIt's expensive but I'm not paying trugreen to come spray fertilizer and weedkiller either.\n\nETA my lawn last summer. The line between what I reseeded is pretty clear. http://imgur.com/gallery/4tuXYUN",

You get that back in reduced labour alone, never mind the savings just on not buying fertilizer and weed killers alone. Every year. \n\nThe American lawn is an ecological disaster, and is also needlessly expensive and labour intensive. In spite of what Republicans tell you, being environmentally responsible will almost always save time and money. \n\n*[The American Obsession with Lawns](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/the-american-obsession-with-lawns/)*\n\n&gt;The sheer volume of resources required to keep lawns alive is staggering. And seems particularly wasteful in consideration of drought plagued places, like California. The significance of lawns persisted in the west for a long time, and was aided by water management technologies that helped transform arid landscapes into lush ones. But that is changing as well, perhaps in part due to the awareness made possible by social media. Lawns require the equivalent of 200 gallons of drinking water per person per day. Californians, who are acutely aware of this wastage, have taken to shaming (#droughtshame) neighbors who persist in watering their lawns. \n___________________________________________________\n\n*[Lawns are the No. 1 irrigated \u2018crop\u2019 in America. They need to die.](https://grist.org/article/lawns-are-the-no-1-agricultural-crop-in-america-they-need-to-die/)*\n\n&gt;But, on balance, lawns are awful for the planet. Our addiction to lawns means that grass is the single largest irrigated agricultural \u201ccrop\u201d in America, more than corn, wheat, and fruit orchards combined. A NASA-led study in 2005 found that there were 63,000 square miles of turf grass in the United States, covering an area larger than Georgia. Keeping all that grass alive can consume about 50-75 percent of a residence\u2019s water.\n\n&gt;Lawnmowers suck up gas and pollute the air: Every year, U.S. homeowners spill some 17 million gallons of gas while filling up mowers. We use tens of millions of pounds of chemical fertilizer and pesticides on our lawns.\n\n&gt;All this effort, of course, isn\u2019t cheap. Americans spend more than $36 billion every year on lawn care, four-and-a-half times more than the annual budget of the Environmental Protection Agency.",

This post just reminded me to order a 10 lb bag of seed. \n\n\nBiodiversity is king. If you planted nothing but clover and so did everyone else, 10 years from now you'd be called stupid. I'm personally planting some in a spot where I want no other grass to take over. If it starts to take over the entire yard, I'll manage that. My experience in my region is that clover starts and dies sooner, and other more native grass takes over (this being my moms yard in rural Tulsa that hasn't been touched besides mowing in like 80 years). at the end of the season. Both come back in the same spots every year but grow at different times. \n\n\nWork with nature around you, not against it. Just guessing I'm I'm betting clover does bad in most of Arizona and Maine for a year round grass. Every state has a Department of Conservation or something similar who would be more than happy to tell people what they should be doing.",

Providing habitat is the #1 thing people can do, even if it\u2019s just a few pots of flowers. \n\nThere are ~4,000 bees native to the US (20k worldwide) and most species get so very little attention. A lot of people think honey bees are in peril, but they aren\u2019t. They\u2019re live stock and while important for the economy, the chances of them becoming endangered, much less extinct, is nil. \n\nOther things you can do for bees: leave your dead plants and leaves in the autumn. It provides overwintering habitat for some bees and other insects. Also try to minimize your pesticide use and if you must use it, don\u2019t spray the flowers and do it in the evenings or early mornings when most bees are inactive. \n\nIf you live in an apartment and cannot provide habitat, you can always support local initiatives for restoration of degraded ecosystems or support businesses (E.g golf courses, other places with lawns) to plant some flowers.  They might even be able to get a nice plaque that says something like \u201cthis is an official pollinator garden\u201d. You\u2019d be surprised on how good it makes the business feel",

The value of seeking out truth was instilled in me from a young age. My studies armed me the analytical tools to actually do so.\n\nAround 2014-2015 I noticed the right leaning outlets were populating my head with falsehoods and I was just embarrassing myself in political debates. I methodically rooted out any \u201cnews\u201d source from my diet that I caught lying to me (without correcting themselves), which took away mostly right leaning media. I also realized real news shouldn\u2019t offer opinions, so that cut out all 24 hour news outlets.\n\nI was always a small government conservative and I realized pretty early on that enforcing my values through law was counterintuitive to that (also realizing I wouldn\u2019t appreciate it if the \u201cradical left\u201d forced me by law to live their morals I didn\u2019t agree with).",

Just sub \u201cyouth pastors\u201d for \u201cdrag queens\u201d if it your eyes accidentally see one of their diatribes. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re *actually* worried about trans who make up like .5% of the population, this is a non-threat to confuse plebs while they steal all the money/housing and roll back civil liberties. They imagineer new \u201cthreats\u201d every couple years like clockwork because they can\u2019t run on policy issues. Dems exist as the \u201cat least we\u2019re not R\u2019s\u201d option while being barely less shitty (but at least don\u2019t want to \u201celiminate\u201d undesirables, remove bodily autonomy, or resurrect the confederacy).  Great options :/",

It's amazing how your two main political parties are considered \"Left and Right\".\n\nWe have a two party left and right system over here in the UK, but when you compare the policies and values, your \"Left\" Democratic Party is comparable to our right wing Tory party, and your \"Right\" wing Republican party would be considered radical political extremists that would never get a single parliamentary seat.",

Those bans never happened in the real world, though unlike the banning of books that is happening now. \n\nThe biggest increase in gun sales was at the beginning of the covid pandemic in response to irrational fears about America devolving into thunderdome until the fox news brains were told the official message that the covid pandemic wasnt real, that is. That changed to a Turner Diaries like fear of minorities mainly black people revolting in response to the George Floyd protests. \n\nThere's an interesting history of ties between the gun show circuits/culture and white supremacy. The Turner Diaries or Bible for most white supremacist groups these days was sold almost exclusively through gun shows and sold over 500,000 copies within a couple of years. Timothy McVeigh was heavily influenced by the copy of the Turner Diaries and other stuff he was exposed to at gun shows. \n\nIt's mainly because groups like the American Nazi party and Posse Comitatus targeted the anti-tax, pro-2a/gun show, and American farmers' movements for infiltratration when they found they could no longer increase recruitment and gain popularity for their ideas of white supremacy and fascism and needed to moderate and conceal the public face of their cause. \n\nGeorge Rockwell of the American Nazi party also started the college speaking grift in the 1960s that has seen a recent resurgence for the same reasons.",

The school reviewed the complaint and the book and then decided to move her book from the elementary school library to the middle school library because they thought it was more appropriate for middle schoolers. That was the \"ban\".  Hard to find a better word for referring to this \"ban\" than imaginary. Would you consider 8th grade history books as banned from schools because they don't appear in elementary school libraries?",

From the perspective of the 3rd grade class, the books have been removed, taken, or banned. \n\nYou're correct that Gormans book wasn't banned, and that's why my comment didn't say gormans book, but was referencing the national campaign to ban books that has been ongoing since trump lost the 2020 election. \n\nThe major issue with the school meeting where Daily Salinas, a dupe who can't and didn't read Gormans book, recommended 5 books be removed from the school is that it was one of thousands of incidents where a national campaign ran by Steve Bannon, the Manhattan Institute, former trump administration/campaign officials, and other aligned hate groups recruit dupes at the local level to harrass schools administration/teachers and school boards to request the banning of books the haven't read or can't read. Thankfully, in this case, the Miami school in question, the Bob Graham Education Center, was staffed with qualified and actually patriotic Americans who handled the complaints well, even though they gave to much consideration to obvious BS. \n\nHere's a report from the American Library Association that conclusively shows the massive increase in attempted and successful book bans. https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2022/09/ala-releases-preliminary-data-2022-book-bans\n\nOne of the big problems is ignorance. I bet almost no one  taking part in or supporting the book banning/censorship  understands the American system of how a libraries' content is curated and the history behind that. I notice most of these people try to associate themselves with the label of patriot or patriotism related to the United States of America but have very little understanding of America's history and what Americanism is. I'd recommend all of them to visit the American Library Association's website and develop an understanding of the American Library system, the history, and American traditions/beliefs at its foundation. \n\nWhat I have seen is an increase in people buying or reading books from the most censored books list from both curiosity and in protest of the very un-American movement to censor and ban books. \n\nRecently, in Florida, one of my relatives' high schools didn't talk about Martin Luther King on or around MLK day and did not discuss the Holocaust at all because of new laws enacted in the state and pressure from the same national political movement that is promoting book bans. It's one of the better high schools in the state, too, or at least was. \n\nIt's not good and the book bans, attacks on LGBT people's right to exist, street violence and violence directed at school boards and teachers, etc are all very on the nose for an attempt to recreate the political and social environment in 1930's Germany.",

But on the other hand, *that was the stated intention* of the person who tried to weaponize the system against content she simply didn't like (because she's a conservative bigot). I see a lot of low-info liberals who shout \"see, see book bans!\" on this, and it makes them sound like they don't care enough to actually dig into the story. If you really needle into the story, you'll see that's not a fair accusation, *but that the truth of the story is still quite problematic* \n\nTo me, its still a huge problem that a single parent acting in bad faith was able to achieve anything at all, and it sets a precedent that schools are willing to entertain nonsense. Every school district has some puritanical asshole parent waiting for an excuse to rage impotently at whatever non-issues conservative media tells them to be upset about that week. The correct response to this was \"You argue that this text has no educational value. We find that this argument fails on its merits because X, Y, Z. Your concerns have been noted and ignored\". It would be so easy to argue that just about any book aligns with some core educational standard of the state.\n\nIf I were the principal of that school, I wouldn't have moved the book from the elementary library to the middle school library. I would have purchased a second copy to include in both libraries, and I would have sent the parent a personal note thanking them for the idea. Don't negotiate with trolls, don't let them act in bad faith to devalue public institutions. But also, let them know that their transparent attempt is \"seen\" for what it is.",

Even women's reproductive controls aren't fool proof but they at least have a biological mechanism for reproduction that has specific targetable processes that can be disrupted, a couple of them in fact. Men just don't have that same reproductive vulnerability. There is no hormone cycle, no periods where they aren't able to reproduce, no easy way to render the sperm invalid.\n\nSo male birth control has to find some method where there isn't really any good method. They've tried various physical methods that disrupted sperm viability and I thought that would be the way that went to market in the end but they almost always had some level of difficulty in ensuring the sperm were actually invalid foe consistent and persistent periods. There were attempts at hormone methods and genetic methods but most of them had many side effects since there was no specific gene or hormone that controlled male fertility and nothing else.\n\nSo this is actually a huge breakthrough. If this gene truly does only impact sperm production then it means there is a specific target that can disrupt male fertility without impacting anything else and being reliable enough. They may have found the solution that everyone has been looking for and no one else has ever found. I really hope this pans out and we finally get male birth control.",

Not only that, for decades there was only a couple different types of oral contraceptive pills. A wide variety of forms of birth control with lower side effects and lower levels of hormones only became available later on.\n\n&gt; Our results indicate that OCP use is associated with smaller hypothalamic and pituitary volumes in healthy women. These findings add to available knowledge on the structural effects of OCPs on the brain. Most notably, effects of OCP use on direct measurements of hypothalamic volume have not been reported. Pertinent data on the pituitary gland is extremely limited. In the only study published to date, pituitary volume in OCP users was lower by 60 \u03bcL compared to NCW, which is congruent with our findings. However, the participants in that study underwent MRI examinations for evaluation of neurological symptoms and diseases [20]. Given the young age of our cohort, absence of significant medication use or medical conditions including neurological, psychiatric, and endocrine disorders, our findings are less likely to be influenced by confounding factors that may affect brain volumes and more likely to represent effects that are solely due to OCP use. Moreover, neither smoking history nor alcohol use, when included in our linear regression model, reached statistical significance as covariates impacting hypothalamic and pituitary volumes.  \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8059834/  \n\n&gt; Combined OCs frequently cause problems in glucose tolerance of variable significance. Low-dose progestins do not seem to affect lipid metabolism, but low and normal dose combined pills may provoke increases in the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. OCs are implicated in vascular accidents of various kinds, but low-dose pills are better tolerated. Cardiovascular risks are increased by age, smoking, use of alcohol, and excess fat in the diet. Hepatobiliary complications may occur during pill use. The carcinogenic role of OCx remains controversial, although growth of preexisting breast cancers is accelerated with pill use. The multifactorial etiologies of cardiovascular ailments, atherosclerosis, and cancerous tumors make the role of OCs difficult to assess. OCs can interact with various drugs, heightening the undesirable effects of each. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12280590/ \n\n&gt; The researchers found that women on hormonal contraceptives were 50 percent more likely to be diagnosed with depression six months later, compared with women who were not prescribed hormonal contraceptives during this time. They also found the women on hormonal contraceptives were 40 percent more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant than were women who weren\u2019t prescribed hormonal contraceptives during this time. The results of this study, as well as others, suggest the pill can increase some women\u2019s risk of depression. This seemed particularly true for non-oral products (such as a patch, vaginal ring or hormonal IUD) and for young women (ages 15 to 19), whose brains are not yet done developing and may be more prone to the influence of hormonal signaling. \n\n&gt; The women on hormonal contraceptives were twice as likely to have attempted suicide during this time than the women not on hormonal contraceptives. But the risk of successful suicide attempts was actually higher: It was triple that of women not on hormonal contraceptives. As with depression risk, the biggest negative impact of hormonal contraceptives on suicide risk was found for young women (ages 15 to 19) on non-oral products. \n\nhttps://ideas.ted.com/how-the-birth-control-pill-affects-your-mood/  \n\nEdit: Since the guy who responded to me, agreeing with me overall, but criticizing my walls of text, just dropped his bomb and then immediately blocked me so I couldn't respond, here:  \n\nI currently have stage III cancer, and am a solo parent to a school-aged child I was trying to get ready for school, and now I have to head out to various medical appointments before going to radiation.

Not a native speaker and I'm curious, can't find it on google. Obviously the gland that secretes feminine hormones becomes smaller, that doesn't mean it has any bad effects. We also know that if we give men testosterone their balls shrink. Not a problem whatsoever. \n\n2. If I understand it correctly if you take two medications not meant together you might have adverse affects on your vascular system. Seems to be not a problem if you ask me. That if you take two pills you shouldn't you MIGHT get adverse effects. Not even going to add to the cancer risk which your quote even says we know nothing about. \n\n3. We all know that the risk of depression goes up after starting hormonal birth control. We also know that within the span of 6 months this risk goes away permanently. And again as I stated when combined with then switching the type of pill this definitely goes away. \n\nSo should you be careful and vigilant when starting new medication? Always! And don't beush it under the rug when you feel down. But it's nothing compared to the study done on men, where almost 50% of men attempted suicide in the study and they had to stop it immediately.

Do you know the function of the pituitary gland? It doesn't *just* secrete \"female\" hormones. It also makes adrenocorticotropic hormone, which has essential functions for both males and females, including regulating metabolism, maintaining blood pressure, regulating blood glucose (blood sugar) levels and reducing inflammation. It also makes thyroid stimulating hormone, regulating your thyroid, and growth hormone....which is responsible for making children grow, and also regulates metabolism and how you process food.  \n\nSo yes. It's kind of a huge deal to your overall health and body function, not just \"female hormones.\" It's hard to take you seriously when you failed to understand just how important the pituitary gland is for normal function.",

It's a natural state that we figured out how to activate. The body, nor immune system sees a problem with it. (there are health consern, and everyone is different, but the baseline is that it is a state that also happens naturally) \n\nThere is alas no such state in men, and every drug tries to switch off reproduction has a lot of backup to prevent it from working.\n\nReproduction is the only thing you evolved to do in the \"mind\" of your body. Anything that prevents that is a high level threat to it. If we get one, I worry that we will see failures show up fast, and it will never hit the same success rate of the pill.\n\n*Also: i do want this. Would mix it into the food of my future teenage son, but I am just very sceptical that we will find a drug that can do this.",

This is even more the case in the modern era where they are even more insividualistic and less family oriented, at least untill they hit they their mid/late thirtoes/ forties.\n\nThat would have unreversible effects on population control, which is number one on the agenda of your average industtialist/ capitalist, as it directly impacts their profits, short term AND long term. Once the pills are out there for everyone to buy, they cant control how much cheap labor they need in the next 5 years by outlawing abortion in the target states of the labor-centrted industries, and outlawing the pill will only move it underground, only making it another commodity cartels distribute. Long story short male cobtracrptive pills will be a bell that can not be unrung. \n\nThats the real reason various forms of male contraceptive studies/efforts have hit the news, but never panned out, they were intercepted for one reason/strategy or another. To the capitalists the disregard for the individual is not too gender-biased, patriarchy is not as invesyed in man vs. woman suffeting ratio as it is about long term profit/control of the masses, anymore.",

I pointed this out to say: but men havent been having it easy exactly, they have been forced into parenthood, and this will finally give them a say at whether they want to have a child with a woman or not, while taking away the control over parenthood from women, to get pregnant without his consent, and force a guy into paying child support/ marriage.

This could have a positive impact on gender equality and reproductive health worldwide, as well as reduce the need for female-centric contraceptive methods such as hormonal pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs). However, it is important to note that the efficacy, safety, and potential side effects of this new gene-based approach to male birth control will need to be thoroughly tested in clinical trials before it can be made available to the public.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, government agencies like the FDA won't be quick to approve a medication that has risk of negative side effects to the user, but no direct health benefits to outweigh the risks.",

With our current view on health care, medical intervention has to go through a cost benefit analysis. Pregnancy is dangerous, it can cause pretty much everything you listed plus death. The potential cost of pregnancy is incredibly high. Therefore birth control for folks with a uterus can carry significant side effects and still be worth the risk. Folks with a penis are not directly impacted by pregnancy. They can walk away at any point and their health would not be effected at all. Their risk is nothing. So _any_ side effects are more than their benefits. \n\nI'm not saying this to justify the precedent. If COVID showed us anything it should have been that health is not completely individual, we live in a community and one person should be allowed to accept discomfort for another person's benefit. But with that view on medicine I don't expect to see male birth control any time soon. Even though many men (my husband included) would happily risk some side effects to reduce the risk of pregnancy in others",

I myself had migraines for a decade on one pill, and despite complaining about them to multiple doctors, it was only the mail order birth control website that said, hey, that's uh, like really serious, like one of the main risk factors for heart attack and stroke while on bc, you need to change the hormones you're taking right now. Everyone I know who's taken birth control has had weight gain, some have been extensive. Mood changes absolutely, the first pill I took made me feel like a robot without emotions. \n\nI would also argue that, especially at the time birth control was being tested originally, these side effects are super dangerous as well. But it's women's health, so it's regarded with a hand wave and people accept it. \n\nDid you know there's a lot of drugs that are never tested on women, or are tested at a much smaller sample size, than men? Because we can get pregnant, so we aren't risked for trials. A lot of those medicines have much different effectiveness for women versus men, because of difference like fat storage, metabolism, general build-women have looser ligaments than men, because we have to give birth. So crash test dummies (I know, it's not meds, more of a tangent here) have always been modeled after men until LAST YEAR. Sure, some companies have used 'women' dummies-which are the 5'0\" 100lbs child sized dummies. And no one requires car manufacturers to use women based crash test dummies, even the child sized one. Every car I drive and almost all the meds I take have been built with men in mind, despite the fact that my body does things differently.\n\nHell, our symptoms for a heart attack are different than men. \n\nMaking sure a drug is safe is understandable. But please understand the privilege you and all men have that the world is literally designed for you. Women would have loved to wait for safer birth control, but unfortunately since we are the one that's directly effected by getting pregnant, we've had to deal with whatever we can get. So a lot of us are rolling our eyes to keep from screaming in rage when someone says, even after a drug is given FDA clearance (meaning it's been tested for a set number of years), that they will continue to wait until it is safe. Because if we don't want to be pregnant, we have never had that choice. \n\nThe book Invisible Women talks about the data bias against women if you're interested. It's more than medicine and car design..",

I think you will have a hard time finding an FDA approved medication that has similarly dangerous side effects and no health benefits for the patient. The side effects are always weighed against the health benefits. Unfortunately, women are the only ones who can benefit from BC medication. \n\nThat said, over the last few years, if I've learned anything, it is that our healthcare policy and strategies are too focused on the individual. The health of the population is just as important as the health of the individual. It's not possible to isolate the two, and moving forward, both the individual and the greater population must drive policy together.",

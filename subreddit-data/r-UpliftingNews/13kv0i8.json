I'm 46, and was told I was an alarmist by all the adults and older people my whole life.  I suspect they really only care cause some will profit off it.\n \n I would like to commend my science teachers all through my primary and high school education. Thank you, what you taught has come to fruition.\n\n\nEdit: spelling",

I worked as a hospice CNA for a while and one of my patients was an Republican Senator in my state for years - he started multiple environmental protection programs, including a massive one that revitalized our local marshlands.  \n\nHe hated what the Republican Party became.  I\u2019m glad he never had to see 2016 or what came after, would\u2019ve broken his heart.  I\u2019m an old school progressive and I found that he and I agreed on quite a bit, although in all fairness this is New England.  Our conservatives have always been a little different.",

Because California and like Mississippi are different places. \n\nLike let's look at California. Most populous state. The most boomers. But also probably the most liberal state too right? And boomers make up the largest percentage of voters. And the majority of them vote democrat 46%, compared to only 31% Republican. \n\nMillennials may be more liberal but nearly half of them aren't even registered to vote. As far California goes, you could make the argument that it is more liberal due to their boomers, and not in spite of them. I'm sure things are similar in other places with major urban areas like New York for example. \n\nhttps://www.publicceo.com/2016/09/just-the-facts-millennial-voters-and-california-politics/",

And for the record, your comment isn't very dickish - it's fine to have different points of view (in a perfect world, I think we would encourage that a lot more!) as long as both sides are respectful.\n\nYou're right, that this can be an incredibly self-serving position for someone to take. I do agree that is the case for some people.\n\nHowever, it's the generalization \"Destroy the planet\", like everyone had an equal part in the decision, that I take issue with. It was really a few dozen rich white men, who made decisions to pursue harmful policies and then deceive American voters about how harmful those policies really were. The government failed to stop them from manipulating both major American parties to serve corporate interests.\n\nNow though, there are so, so, so many elderly people who barely have two cents to rub together. They were never the ultimate decision-makers, and for the most part were just living their life the way they thought they should, based on what they were told by their government and media.\n\nShould we fault them for realizing their past ignorance, later in life? Should we discourage them from getting involved in social movements, now that they're on our side?\n\nAgain, most of the people from that generation personally had nothing to do with the damage we've wrought on the global climate. It started before they were born and continued throughout their lives. Easy targets as they may be, they really are not the bad guys.\n\nThe entities constantly working to deceive large populations are the bad guys, and they never went away, that's my whole position, here.",

You're using two different terms for the same thing because you like one job and dislike another. They're both work, they're both \"being productive\".\n\nWhy not rephrase your original point to \"nobody has ever wanted unfulfilling/degrading work\" or \"everyone generally wants to work in their life, as long as they can find meaningful work\".\n\nThese two statements seem way more accurate, while still being a generalization. Saying \"anyone who wants to work has a mental issue\" just makes you sound lazy and ignorant. As someone who has spent time unemployed as an adult, I found that I really do want to work. Crappy job or no, it's depressing to contribute nothing to your society/community.",

This is pure greed.  \n\nI'm 50 and when my husband's parents passed, we got exactly what we asked for, nothing.  Well apart from her jewellery and I inherited all her sewing equipment but no house or cash, thankfully.  They were the Silent Generation not Boomers, but we had already convinced them to go out and spend what they had from their house sale, they'd had to downsize.  They left amounts to the grandchildren but nothing to their actual kids.  But what they did was have a fun filled seven years going on several cruises and other holidays and outings.  We all got together as a family as well during some of these so we could join in on the fun too.  \n\nAs a family we were all happy to see this happen, wanted it to happen.  I've already got my mum to do the same, she's the same age as them so again Silent Generation, and she's throughly enjoying her golden years.  \n\nAll our parents started work at 14 and worked full time their entire adult lives until the state retirement age.  They worked some of the hardest jobs back in the day, long hours, gruelling work.  They deserve to live a bit now.  \n\nOh and as for buying lots of shit none of my parents had a lot, their first wages were less than \u00a32 a week more than half of which, happily, went to their own parents for the household.  \n\nI've uncles and aunties who are Boomers and they're not this wealthy entity that everyone seems too think they should be.  What they are though is folks who've worked damn hard to get what they do own.  You have no idea of the struggles of the generations of those that came before you.

Sure we were the first, biggest users of it, but there was no awareness of the damage it could cause. There was no active pursuit of dividing ourselves. For the most part, we didn't know we were being manipulated until it was too late. \n\nWe didn't create the concept of social media all together as a generation, just like boomers didn't create the concept of pollution. \n\nDo you blame the ordinary folks who got pulled along into the madness by the inaction of their government in the face of a new threat, or do you blame the folks who knowingly and deliberately pursued something that was harmful to the masses for their own benefit?\n\nWe should have imposed strict environmental regulations in the 1970's. We should have killed Facebook and clamped down on privacy regulations in 2014. Some of us knew then, most did not learn the truth until much later, or they still haven't.\n\nUnfortunately, hindsight is 20/20 but foresight is legally blind.",

Why blame their voters? Don't you see how that will only reinforce their beliefs, if you attack them for something they don't see themselves as having actually done?\n\nNot even to mention the boomers who are actively fighting against this shit (like in the damn article we're commenting on) - you've been sold a narrative that this generation is to blame for it all, because that's simple and it doesn't affect you, because you're not one of *them*.\n\nBut as a group, they're no more to blame for the failure to meet the challenge of climate change, than your generation is for the failure to meet the challenge of social media.

Politicians catered to them for decades since that would move the needle the most and they still do to a certain point. Id wager all the geriatric people in the US government are also a result of this.\n\nEither way, in my perception the boomers got plenty of warning and continued to elect politicians that promised them comfortable solutions. I\u2019m not even expecting current/future generations to do much better in this regard, but the book on the boomers is pretty much written: they collectively \u201echose\u201c to push the problem down the road cause approaching it head on would have been too big of an inconvenience.",

That's my biggest concern, as I see it as still ongoing, more advanced than ever before, through social media. \n\nWe used to have news reports about the \"inconsistencies\" of climate change science as heat waves and flooding were growing in frequency, and now we have algorithms that feed us YouTubers informing us about the \"inconsistencies\" of democracy/liberty etc. as fascism rears its ugly head again. If you're not seeing that, you could be seeing a 'we're doomed' feed that pushes us towards inaction and/or indifference instead.\n\nWho do we blame for not stopping Facebook? Who do we blame for the increasing polarization of our politics? Is it all the fault of the generation that embraced social media?\n\nI say no - you should blame the manipulators. If someone knowingly, and willingly, implements a policy that will cause harm to millions for personal benefit, they should be the ones we point the finger at.\n\nBlaming the entire generation just gives the ones who have actually done harm, and actually got the benefit from that harm, a convenient crowd to hide behind.",

The second part of the quote (which is not in the previous comment) sayd that you have to disntinguish between good teachers and bad teachers, and then choose the good one.\n\nChinese source: https://wapbaike.baidu.com/item/\u4e09\u4eba\u884c\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u6211\u5e08/10967919?adapt=1&amp;fromtitle=\u4e09\u4eba\u884c\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u6211\u5e08\u7109&amp;fromid=5805493\n\nEnglish source: http://www.linguee.com/chinese-english/translation/\u4e09\u4eba\u884c\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u6211\u5e2b.html\n\nEdit: Wow, I can't believe I actually looked it up.

A person without a degree can have just as much knowledge and power as a lawyer if you're smart enough. I've actually had to go to court to defend a case with no prior law education  and because of not being able to afford one. \n\nAfter months of research and shit ton of googling I managed to pile up enough information to fight the case and managed to win a settlement. \n\nNot many people know this, but just because lawyers have a law degree doesn't mean you don't have the same privileges as they do when it comes to being in the courtroom. But honestly this doesn't apply to most citizens. You gotta be smart enough to know how to do proper research and google the shit out of your work. It will take a shitload of time but that's part of the whole reason why you hire lawyers to do the work for you, IF you have the money... sorry I'm drunk and just rambling on. ",

For various reasons, there's much less machinery involved in farming in China, which means that farmers spend a LOT more time doing manual labor ([this](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-reality-of-life-onn-a-rural-chinese-farm-2010-11) is an article originally from the Atlantic that touches on the subject). To truly imagine his situation, you'd need to imagine that you have to work a labor intensive job day in and day out, surviving on a paltry income even compared to the poorer half of the country. You don't have a computer let alone internet access, which greatly limits the amount of resource you have access to. So yeah, I'm incredibly impressed that he taught himself with only three years of formal education under such tough conditions.",

It is a major reason why literacy is a problem in rural China, and why Korean and Japanese have developed phonetic systems. You don't have pinyin in most texts, especially I would imagine law text, so you won't know what the word sounds like, even if someone said it to you already.  That connection between sound and how something looks on paper is missing.  Whereas you could find for example English words, without having seen it before in a book, by pronouncing the word using the alphabet as it looks, and if you heard the word in conversation you would know the meaning of the word. In Chinese this can't be done without pinyin under the characters.  So without going to school and have someone show you the characters and what they mean, reading by yourself becomes a major task, not mentioning he is going through law books.  I am so proud of this guy, major respect.",

If not, they're required to make contribution for the betterment of others in some manner. On top of that a notable portion of all attorneys work in areas that are not at all that lucrative and actually don't provide enough income to support a family, i.e. state employees (namely public defenders and the like), public health/welfare, legal aid, immigration, paralegals (who are substantially consumed in legal work), and even some private practice attorneys (I personally know a handful). \n\nAlso, to your mention of corporate attorneys: these are attorneys dealing in the realm of huge financial implications. You don't want some Joe off the street handling your multimillion dollar contract and/or transaction. These are sharp people who have invested many years and energy into their specialized work. Just like any other profession, there are plenty of good but also a few not so good that inevitably give a bad name to all although it is by no means an accurate representation. \n\nTL;DR: You know nothing John Snow",

Organic farming is great because yeah, it's the local guys who've been in the area for generations but those aren't the type of farmers who are going to supply 15.2 billion bushels of corn per year. Organic farming will never be that efficient unless you modify the genetics of plants in order to fit the region. GMO has turned into such a buzzword and a synonym for *processed* foods when in reality it's just a seed that's been optimized to grow in certain areas at certain times of year. \n\n ",

My sister is an agronomist and tries to determine which varieties of wheat grow best in certain regions of the Australian wheat belt. It's about 2.86 tonnes per hectare, but some strains produce more than others in certain conditions, on certain base soils or on a certain slope. The strains change within a few square km. They also need to be replaced every few years with new breeds as monocultures are terrible for disease resistance, so new strains of fungi and other pests figure out whatever the new breeds weaknesses are and the whole strain needs to be replaced with a different one constantly. But this is how you feed 7 billion people.",

I worked a few summers on a farm and a few more at a large grainery. And, what I learned in my time there, is that while farming seems very simple, it is not. Also, things that seem black and white are usually not and there are two sides to every story. But, living in a farming community and knowing so many farmers you get a lot of opinions from people with real life experiences in it Farming policies affect everybody in our town. GMOs are an especially divisive topic even within the farming community, but you get a sense for just how complicated the issue is when you hear so many different people with first hand experiences speak more about it in an atmosphere that isn't a comment to a newspaper or set discussion of the topic, but in idle conversation on a random day.",

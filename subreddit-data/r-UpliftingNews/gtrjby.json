The state has the \"Gewaltmonopol\" which means he is the only one who has the legitimacy to use Gewalt in the sense of force, not brutality. The latter is always wrong and understood as excessive or unneccesary violence, but force or violence is often needed to protect or enforce the law. Because sometimes it is actually the right thing to shoot someone, think of terrorists. So the word has actually the same meaning. It also means the prohibition of self justice. If you're not in a situation of imminent danger, you are not allowed to take revenge, you have ask the state to do so by sentencing the person harming you. Because he is the only one who is allowed to use force/violence, by putting the person behind bars.",

Sure these people could stay home, safe from the virus and be responsible citizens and continue to watch a brutal tool be used against their neighbors again, and again, and again. Or, they can go out, mobilize for the cause of stopping their neighbors ,children, and parents from being murdered in the streets. \n\nThese are both pandemics, do not be fooled by that, one of them may kill you, but for some people, they have to wonder when the other one will. \n\n2 weeks? I don\u2019t think we have to look that far into the future. The police and their masters are escalating this daily, not to say some bad actors on the other side aren\u2019t, they have upgraded from mace to rubber. How long until live rounds start leaving their firearms? The national guard is being mobilized in many places and we all know how well that\u2019s ended in the past. Especially for marginalized people choosing to stand up to their oppressors. \n\nYes, the virus is bad, it could be an ugly future for many who attend these protests. But it could also be deadly being in attendance at these protests in more immediate ways. To be honest, what the protestors are risking should at least give you a gauge on how they feel, the message they want to spread is much more important than their lives as individuals. These aren\u2019t protests against the perception of tyranny, these are protests against tyranny that has a long and well documented record. They don\u2019t just want a haircut, or an outing to their favorite burger joint, they want to stop being murdered in the streets. \n\nI for one will be joining my local protest in a couple of hours, virus be damned. My mask will be on and I expect many others will have theirs on as well.",

Look at places that have a particularly good system of police oversight and build from there. \n\nThe oversight committee needs to hold power over the police or it has no threat of action.

It would be helpful to have a federal body who can go from looking through paperwork and asking question (why was this man arrested, why is this paperwork missing) up to closing the department for a full investigation of those involved. \n\nThe important part is its external. Internal oversight is so easily blinded. \n\nYes, vexatious complaints will exist. But thats why there should always as much proof as possible for a decision to be made. Body cams are an important one. \n\nUnfortunatly you are building from a place where the police will be presumed guilty until innocense is proven.... Because the community has no faith in them.",

Plenty of departments actively and aggressively make it difficult for meaningful internal oversight. Lost bodycam footage (and pushback against bodycams in the first place), the prevailance of misleading and conflicting information released by PDs, documented cases of police brutality that result in relatively light sentences (compared to if a normal citizen did it) etc all erode trust. \n\nAt this point, for the process to have any legitimacy, you would pretty much need a 3rd party member of this oversight committee literally over the shoulder of anyone associated with the PD being investigated. At that point, cut the PD out entirely. Separate them entirely from the process. Maybe a couple of years down the line, after this oversight committee has taken action and more cops are facing stricter consequences for instances of police brutality, you can involve the police in some minimal role.",

Have them join the protesters peacefully. Let the good cops march for police reform. Which police officer doesn't join them should not be on the force. If you want to deescalate the hate, allow the cops to go out to the people and agree that what they did to Floyd was wrong. If the don't agree with that then again, they are off the force. Bring them police and people together.\nYes, there still will be looters. But that is better than armed military strolling down First Ave. with guns.\n\nAlso look into reorganizing police unions....

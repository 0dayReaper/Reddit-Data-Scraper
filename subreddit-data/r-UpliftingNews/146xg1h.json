I don't wanna see anyone deal with addiction, it's a bastard of an illness. But given Bam's pattern in the past? I'm not gonna hold my breath.",

I wouldn't be surprised if there were a miriade of other pieces as well. Doesn't matter what they are, because it's always subjective. But equally real, powerful &amp; debilitating. The brain doesn't give two-sh*ts if one is happy or sad. It only cares about survival, and choosing alcohol/drugs etc is survival.\n    \nIt's amazing enough that we've evolved to have a set of  \"Executive Function\" abilitiies. To be able to \"notice\" that we're in a (self-) destructive cycle. Still bloody difficult to break away. Almost impossible, it would seem.\n    \n So I have nothing but admiration, respect, awe &amp; reverence to those who have climbed out. It's fucking incredible.\n    \nAnd to anyone still in the thick of it: I'm sorry you're having a difficult human-experience right now. Don't give up.

If it doesn't......it will simply be another sad chapter in the end of Bam's life. I WANT to hope it's the former. But I am prepared for the latter.",

They get all sorts of subsidized funding, can be run in relatively low cost premises and the cost for rehab programs in crazy high. I know a guy that runs a single location and he\u2019s making a fortune, and he\u2019s not even 30.",

I'm not talking about how long it takes for him to relapse; he'll probably do that in Odom's Sunny Side Recovery parking lot.  From the time he walks out to the time he has his next drug fueled public meltdown...I'm guessing 6 weeks.",

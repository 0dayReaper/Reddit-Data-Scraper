            "comment": "I volunteer with Election Protection and highly recommend that if anyone experiences potential voter suppression, including intimidation, misinformation, or being prevented entirely from voting, call Election Protection. The organization documents and investigates these cases. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link the website or add the phone number but it will be the first result in Google. The organization is also a great resource if you have any general questions such as how and when to file absentee ballots, how to comply with local state COVID-19-related regulations, or even to find out your precinct location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worked during the Georgia and South Carolina elections this week and I alone received numerous calls of potential suppression ranging from last minute precinct changes, voters suddenly finding out they are not registered to vote, precincts lacking working or any electronic voting machines, especially long wait times, and even someone who declared they were voting for one political party but was nonetheless given a ballot for the either party. I cannot confirm any of these instances were in fact acts of suppression, but the sheer volume of cases that were reported is alarming. The organization had to call in as many additional volunteers as possible because call volume exceeded their best estimates. Voter suppression is a problem throughout the country, but it does appear Georgia experiences it at a higher rate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso in Georgia (I do not know if they work in other states) there is Fair Fight, which I do not have any direct experience with but I understand that they too work to document and fight voter suppression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone is entitled to an opportunity to vote.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: If you'd like to volunteer you can contact the organization [https://866ourvote.org/volunteer/](https://866ourvote.org/volunteer/)  \n\nIf you're concerned about your health and safety, you should know that the call centers are run remotely at this time and you can take calls from your home.",

The voter reported that they clearly stated their party affiliation and asked for that party's ballot, thus saying the party name twice, but was given the ballot for the other party. The individual did not recognize what had occurred, was confused by the candidates but thought the party must have made last minute changes, and ended up submitting a largely blank ballot because they weren't sure who they were voting for. Afterwards they looked up the candidates and realized they received the wrong ballot but had already left the precinct. \n\nI am not saying this is voter suppression. It could have been an honest, albeit negligent mistake by the poll worker. I used to work at polling precincts, and during peak hours you may have a lot of voters in line and may be trying to work quickly, so mistakes happen. But it also could be voter suppression.\n\nIt would also have been improper for the poll worker to provide both ballots.",

I'd assumed everyone had to wait the same 10-30 minutes in line that I did. \n\nThis is one of many things I just can't understand on my own, even if it's obvious to the person it's happening to. I live in an almost entirely white community. I can't ask questions on social media without getting attacked for my ignorance (which, ironically, is what I'm trying to reduce).\n\nEdit: For people asking me why I don't Google stuff, I do sometimes, but I take it with a very large grain of salt. I know from my own experience with epilepsy that Google results are often full of misinformation. It's also very difficult not to skew your results, because you'll find what Google's algorithm thinks you want to hear.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

Very urban but fairly affluent as well (you either needed money to live downtown or, as I was, be a college student).\n\nI now live in the suburbs of Atlanta in a predominantly black community. My wait time on Tuesday was over 3 hours for maybe two hundred people in front of me. Some of whom I overheard talking about how they\u2019d have to take PTO for the time they missed despite getting there before the doors opened because, surprise, the place opened 30 minutes late as well. And because of these lines, parking was extremely limited and cars were parked in the streets for a mile out, blocking traffic because there was nowhere else to park. Crazy thing is, I feel *lucky* that at least for the first 3 hours I was there the machines all worked and nothing seemed to go wrong because I know how frequently that happens elsewhere, especially in GA and especially in Atlanta.\n\nWhen my partner called in to tell his work he\u2019d be late, his boss almost didn\u2019t believe him because *his* line was only 5 minutes, in a very red district with very few minorities. Gee, wonder why? /s",

That seems like an odd, and kind of conceited stance to take towards affecting change, since the whole point is that there\u2019s clearly division right now and some people need help figuring this stuff out whether they admit it or not. \n\nSo obviously the conversations can get heated. It\u2019s not like that just online, people get nasty and argumentative in real life too. \n\nBut if we actually want something to change, keeping our info and our experiences and our answers to ourselves simply to avoid a potentially unpleasant argument is completely defeating the whole purpose of all of this, isn\u2019t it? \n\nI know it\u2019s tiring. I just feel like real work to affect real change is bound to be tiring. It\u2019s bound to be unpleasant. Nobody said this was gonna be easy, but the discussions are absolutely necessary. \n\nSo I hope anybody with answers can keep spreading the message. The hate and ignorance is frustrating, yes. But how much more frustrating would it be if we all just let hate and ignorance win just because we simply resent having to argue and fight for what\u2019s right? \n\nJust my 2 cents.

The number of voting sites in minority areas have been drastically cut and their hours are 'less than generous' which cause long wait times.  Between this and the way voting districts are laid out, it's obvious that there's a problem.  Add to this that predominantly poor people are the ones who have trouble getting IDs, and that minorities are over represented in lower income groups. \n\nLook at Tennessee, which is my home state. Shelby County in West Tennessee Is EXACTLY IT'S OWN DISTRICT. There are NO other districts that match the borders of a single county.  Can you guess why?",

They essentially isolate them to one district then make sure voting booths are setup in the most inconvenient place for them to get to. They might have to take a 2hr+ buss ride to the nearest booth in the busiest part of town so then they have to wait hours on top of that to vote, then hours long bus rides back.\n\nOn top of that, since all the minorities are isolated to one district they only get one real representative, while Republican, typically white, districts are separated to maximize the number of representatives they get. Anyone who thinks gerrymandering should be legal is litterally supporting fascism, by definition. There's mathematical ways to do this that don't involve some random guy drawing a circle around high density minority population and calling it a day. It's fucking ridiculous.",

These are *lifetime* seats, so if a party can get the majority, they can confirm judges that will likely make the sort of court rulings they want, influencing our judicial system, and having those people in there making rulings for decades.",

Black people are disproportionately punished for nonviolent drug offenses and are more likely to serve jail time for drugs. Make it so they lose their right to vote, and now you've completely wiped out a good chunk of people who would have voted against you.\n\nAnother side effect is that prisoners end up treated terribly because they can't vote in their own interests, and the general public is apathetic towards them. Candidates who could change things don't really get a good reputation from being \"soft on crime\" and anyone trying to help prisoners' rights is usually spun as wanting to turn prison into a vacation.",

He and Jordan are whores protecting their own interests. LeBron and Jordan had chances be Kapernick but passed because it would damage them financially. This is not /r/UpliftingNews.

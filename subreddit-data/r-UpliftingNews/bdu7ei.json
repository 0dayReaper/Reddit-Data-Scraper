Organ, windows, bells, relics... All safe. Only the forest is lost and the stone work... Now we'll see what damage the water brings and what art pieces didn't make it.",

It's so much more. \n\nThe forest is a huge loss, but that is something that can be replaced with modern materials if necessary. Not ideal and my historian heart hurts a little, but it will be way safer when it comes to fire safety. But what lies underneath: The windows, the organ, that's irreplacable. \nI can't wait until they can go inside and remove the remaining pieces and assess them",

Assuming it will be going on when I'm in the EU.\n\nEdit:  )\n\nEdit 2: sorry to the people who are upset with my sentiment and hopes at doing something cool. I'm probably letting this get to me more than I should but. I never really held the grand illusion that I would actually be able to be a part of it all. Never should have commented..\n\nEdit 3: Holy wow you all. Thank you for the love and thank you kind stranger for my First Plantnum!!!!! You all really brightened my day!",

            "comment": "Haunting new photos of Notre Dame's interior reveal how it survived the inferno after it was revealed three of its iconic Rose Windows escaped damage, as detectives probe the renovation work which may have led to the blaze.\n\nThe pictures revealed the golden crucifix and altar were preserved amongst the smouldering rubble after the roof was destroyed by Monday night's fire.\n\nThree 'irreplaceable' Rose Windows, which date to the 13th century and were last night feared to have melted or exploded, were intact.\n\nAttention has now turned to what may have caused Notre Dame, part of which was being restored in a \u20ac150million refurbishment, to fall victim to such a disaster.\n\nThe focus of prosecutors is currently on contractors Le Bras Freres, whose owner Julien Le Bras last year boasted his firm's goal was 'to keep as many old items as possible and not to put the building at risk' after they were awarded a \u20ac5.7m (\u00a35m, $6.5m) contract as part of the cathedral's restoration project. \n\nDetectives investigating the catastrophic blaze are today interviewing specialist restorers who were carrying out works on the cathedral spire when the inferno broke out.\n\nFrench police are understood to have launched a criminal inquiry after a 'stray flame' caused fire to engulf the landmark last night, with heroic firefighters battling for eight hours to bring the blaze under control.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor's office is probing 'involuntary destruction caused by fire', indicating authorities are treating the blaze as a tragic accident and not arson or terrorism.\n\n'Nothing suggests that it was a voluntary act,' Remy Heitz told reporters outside the Gothic cathedral, adding that the workers employed at the site were being questioned over Monday's blaze.  \n\nSome of its 200 specialist employees were working at the site where the fire is thought to have originated, the cathedral's 300ft-tall wooden and lead spire, which collapsed in front of crowds of horrified Parisians at 8pm. \n\nA source close to the inquiry said that many of the restorers had been interviewed overnight, with prosecutors focusing on the equipment used at the 850-year-old cathedral, where light and power sources were limited.\n\nIn such circumstances, hordes of cables and wires would have to be attached to dozens of generators, which would then be hoisted high up on to medieval building. \n\n'The fear is that a small fire began in the rood where they were working,' the source added. \n\n'The irony is that the restorers had just begun working on the spire which collapsed along with much of the roof.'\n\nLe Bras Freres is one of the most respected companies of its kind in France, and last year finished a widespread restoration programme of Reims Cathedral in the east of the country.   \n\nThe firm had won the \u20ac5.7million contract to restore the Notre Dame spire, which was designed by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and erected in 1859.\n\nThey were due to be on site for up to four years along with Europe Scaffolding, another company which had just put 250 tons of scaffolding around Notre Dame, along with a lift that could move up and down the 300ft spire.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Julien Le Bras, the chief executive of the Bras Brothers, said he had no initial comment to make in regards to the inquiry.\n\nThe blaze, which broke out as the last crowds of tourists ended visits at around 7pm, was finally declared to be 'fully extinguished' at about 9.45am this morning.\n\nAs the fire raged, brave rescue teams raced to recover what treasures they could from the Gothic masterpiece, which housed priceless artefacts and relics of huge religious and international significance.\n\nAmong them was the reputed Crown of Thorns, supposedly worn by Jesus during his crucifixion, which was carried to safety by a human chain of emergency service workers. \n\nToday the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV that the three beautiful rose windows on the north, west and south sides of the church had all survived intact. \n\nFears had grown for the 'really irreplaceable' stained-glass windows, dating back to the 13th century, amid the heat of the fire last night. \n\nThe status of other relics, including a purported piece of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, remained unclear today. \n\nFrench priest Jean-Marc Fournier led the efforts to save the  Crown of Thorns. \n\nEtienne Loraillere, an editor for France's KTO Catholic television network, said Father Fournier 'went with the firefighters into Notre Dame Cathedral to save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament'.\n\nThis was confirmed by an emergency services source who said: 'Father Fournier is an absolute hero.\n\n'He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the Cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear.'\n\nMore than 400 firemen were needed to tame the inferno that consumed the roof and collapsed the spire of the eight-centuries-old cathedral. They worked through the night to bring the fire under control some 14 hours after it began.\n\nOne firefighter was injured; no one else was reported hurt in the blaze which began after the building was closed to the public for the evening.  \n\nShortly after the the blaze broke out, French fashion mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, the husband of Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100million euros (\u00a386 million) towards the restoration effort. \n\nHours later, French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced that his family and his LVMH luxury goods group would donate 200million euros to help with repairs. \n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral, whatever the cost. \n\nHe said in a speech outside the church: 'We will appeal to the greatest talents and we will rebuild Notre-Dame because that's what the French are waiting for, because that's what our history deserves, because it's our deepest destiny.' \n\nPope Francis said Tuesday he hoped everyone would pull together to rebuild the devastated Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris following a massive fire.\n\n'I hope the Notre-Dame cathedral may once again become, thanks to reconstruction work and the mobilization of all, a jewel in the heart of the city,' Francis said in a statement issued by the Vatican.\n\nLeaders from around the world offered their condolences to France. Among them was Queen Elizabeth II, who said: 'Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened to see the images of the fire which has engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n\n'I extend my sincere admiration to the emergency services who have risked their lives to try to save this important national monument.\n\n'My thoughts and prayers are with those who worship at the Cathedral and all of France at this difficult time.'  \n\nNotre Dame had previously the site of a terror scare in 2016 when a car carrying seven gas cylinders was found near the cathedral. \n\nThree women were arrested over the alleged terror plot, although they were thought to have been targeting a Paris railway station rather than the cathedral itself. \n\nPolice have made clear today that they believe Monday night's fire was an accident.",

That building identifies your culture and heritage and the \"who\" of what your city has become.\n\nI had a house fire in our family home when I was a teenager. It was the summer before I graduated high school. We lost everything. We re-built and my parents have a great home now but after 10 years I still never see that building as my home. I basically slept there for my last semester of high school, summers in university and weekends and holidays. My bedroom was replaced with my mother's sewing room. The layout is completely different than the former house. I have no emotional connection to that building.\n\nAfter the fire all of my parents focus was on rebuilding the structure. Insurance covered an apartment for the months during the rebuild but my father and uncles, and myself, rebuilt the house. All of the energy was focused on getting the structure back that I think we really lost site of rebuilding the memories and culture our family had.\n\nI now look at my own house as just a building. I have no emotion connection to it. It serves only to keep me and my wife warm and dry. It's difficult to get attached to things because you know they can literally just go up in smoke.\n\nIt will take decades for Paris to recover from this and the toll cannot be measured in bricks and wood.

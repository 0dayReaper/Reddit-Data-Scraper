I\u2019m not super informed on the subject but legalization seems to have generated a massive amount of tax money, drug overdoses have gone down and crime didn\u2019t increase. Only thing I can think if lobbying from things like the pharmaceutical industries and others? I\u2019m learning more about politics but not as informed as I should be.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the replies, interesting stuff. I can\u2019t reply to them all but I\u2019m reading them!",

Every time you see some heinous story of a cop killing someone and getting paid leave for it, it's because the union had the department's balls in a vice.  Either give this scum fuck cop his vacation for murdering someone, or every one of your officers walks out.  That's why they're so shitty.",

Maybe some munchies and motivation issues for some but not all users. Financial crimes, on the other hand, oppress entire sectors of the population. Old people being screwed out of their savings, college grads in perpetual debt, homeowners losing their houses, suicide... Fuck, banks knowingly cover up cartel money in the millions (billions?) and rarely face consequences greater than a token fine. I could go on. Point is the scale and impact of white collar crime is vastly greater than all of the sub-cartel level pot crime, and it's not policed nearly to the same extent. Afraid of losing your police budget? Put that money towards activities that serve the community.\n\nEdit: autocorrect corrections",

Maybe the DEA can, ya know, just focus on that. \n  \nOr do something about that legal opoid epidemic happening. \n\nOr roll the DEA into the ATF (alchol-tobacco-firearms). \n  \nJobs aint an issure. Its money. Theres a lot of money in pot being illegal. Civil forfeiture, private prisons, phillip morris (marlboro) losing millions of customers to something that wont kill them. Pharma wants you to keep buying their artificial $60 a pill painkillers instead of something that grows in the ground everywhere. \n  \nThe problem is ALL of those groups are short sighted morons who would rather maintain the status quo. Phillip Morris should be buying every damn pot farm available so that the day pot goes federally legal, they'll have Green Marlboro packs in every gas station. Because when it does, the tobacco industry might die. Smokers have been dying off, literally, for decades. But theyd rather hold onto that 5% of the population (or w/e it is) instead of the much much larger % of americans that occasionally smoke.",

I hear a lot of \"well other states have done it...\" when the state in question doesn't have the same referendum rules at the statewide level as states that have legalized/taxed the sale of weed (or their voters aren't working through the process to make it legal that way)",

That doesn't really answer your question but I think it's enough to say that 1 billion in tax revenue for Colorado is a lot. \n\nThat said I think states would make a mistake if they assume they will have Colorado type numbers if they legalize. Colorado has a younger population than the nation as a whole and a more weed friendly population. There is also a pretty big tourist industry in Colorado and they are surrounded by states where it is illegal so people from those states are probably traveling into Colorado to smoke. Even in terms of recreational marijuana Colorado also has the least restrictive laws and things like edibles are also legal. Basically all the conditions are right for Colorado to get a lot of money from taxing marijuana and other states probably shouldn't assume they would get 178 dollars per person in revenue.",

I guess it was classified schedule 7 - the same as possession as heroin.  Fucking. Bullshit.\n\nIt wasn't actually mine - it was my wife's, which was in her purse.  But i wasn't gonna let her get in trouble for that - she was applying to get her master's and I didn't want it to ruin her chances.  So I took the bullet.\n\nAfter 6 months I went to court and after a year probation period it was put under seal.  Still had to spend thousands on a lawyer and had to go to a drug counselor for that whole period.  I also lived in CT at the time and had to travel to Brewster twice a week for the counseling - about an hour away.\n\nAnd this is as someone who is a white male - POC get locked the fuck away.\n\nThe war on drugs is so fucking stupid.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t talk to the cops y\u2019all\n\nhttps://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE",

I mean he literally took it from my wife's purse.  But nope - cuffed me and threw me in the car.\n\nI was also driving a work truck for a delivery that day - a beat up F150 and i looked a little haggard.  I was working for my dad at the time for his woodworking company.  TBH i didnt even know my wife had weed in purse.  She was just tagging along for the ride.\n\nHe said he pulled me over because i was \"too close to the truck in front of me\" which is total bullshit cuz I never tailgate.  I seriously doubt he would've pulled me over if I was driving my Audi and wasn't dressed the way I was.  Probably thought I had something stronger on me or something and was just itching to arrest someone.\n\nThat cop was such an asshole.\n\nHe said he smelled weed, which I didnt, so when he asked if there was any in the car.  Since my wife did regularly have small amounts of weed on her and knowing it was decriminalized in NY, I said \"I dont know maybe?\" Boom - pretense to search everything.\n\nThe lesson I learned is dont tell cops anything. Even if you think itll help you.  You may incriminate yourself unknowingly.\n\nObligatory: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE)",

Police officers are somewhat reluctant to give someone a criminal record for something small and stupid but have no problem with a civil citation.\n\nSo, problem 1 is that actually enforcement *increases*\n\nThe second part is that poor people who get these citations may be unable to pay.  Failure to pay is a criminal offense, and that is pretty much issued automatically by the system, so there isn't a judge to say \"jail time is unreasonable for a joint\"\n\nSo problem 2 is that cannabis-related criminal convictions can go *up*\n\nSo imagine this much more concrete scenario:. Local cop knows weed isn't a big deal looks the other way for most things.  Decriminalization happens and the cop is now under pressure at work to issue a few citations.  No big deal, except it kicks off this chain of things that results in jail time and a criminal record and is entirely out of the cop's hands.",

            "comment": "Be aware, this is NOT legalizing marijuana.  I'm a criminal defense attorney in New York, and I handle a lot of these cases.\n\nIn a nutshell - prior to this bill, there were two types of low-level possession of marijuana charges - one was a  \"violation\", which is not a crime, it's similar in level to a traffic infraction.  It was punishable by fines and ultimately up to 15 days in jail after you were convicted of several of them.  This was simply possession marijuana, such as in your pocket or glove compartment.\n\nThe more serious offense was a class B misdemeanor, which is a crime punishable by up to 90 days in jail.  This is for smoking marijuana or possessing it in public view (ie: holding a joint or it's sitting in your car cupholder or whatever.\n\nThis new bill takes the first charge and reduces the maximum penalty to a $50 fine no matter how many times your get convicted of it.  More importantly, it takes the misdemeanor and changes it to a violation (not a crime, remember) with a maximum penalty of a $200 fine no matter how many times you get convicted of it.\n\nSo it technically \"decriminalizes\" one of the marijuana charges, inasmuch as possession of up to a certain amount is no longer a crime, but it does not legalize marijuana inasmuch as it is still a violation to possess it, so it is still illegal.  \n\nA very important clause they added, which will keep attorneys and the courts busy for a LONG time is that they modified the statute permitting vacatur of judgments (convictions) to apply this statute RETROACTIVELY, meaning anyone who was previously convicted under these two charges can file a motion to vacate that conviction.  This is really only important for those convicted of misdemeanors, but for many people can give them a clean record.\n\nEdit: Also, it's not the law as of the writing of this post, it still needs to be signed by the Governor, but he is expected to sign it.\n\nEdit 2: Another important change is that the misdemeanor which is being reduced no longer applies to smoking marijuana or possessing in public view, only to possession of between 1 and 2 ounces.",

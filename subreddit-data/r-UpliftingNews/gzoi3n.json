Think of the shit that will have to be codified in to law to ensure that future Presidents release their financial information, divest of conflicting business assets, and succumb to congressional subpoenas.  The emoluments clause has to be rewritten in detail, laws protecting whistleblowers will have to be re-written to give them teeth, etc. etc.  Essentially, we should have never assumed that either Presidents or cops would work in the best interests of the people they serve.   Just as important will be making sure those new laws describe specific penalties for those who break them.  This is the best example I can think of for why we can't have nice things.",

Honorable tax information does not exist in the political world on either side. \"Insider Trading\" has been a common thing for great profit of the \"honorable elected\" for as long as it can be recorded. TERM LIMITS are the requirement. The Congress sets the standard. The President is not a king. The last 3.5 don't matter in the timeline of the problem you illustrate. Taxes? The pirates don't give a crap about taxes. Complaining about each others taxes is throwing  shade and bull shitting voters. The way Police treat people is profitable at this moment because it's the path to re election which is how the two sides make money. They don't care about right or wrong. Only re election funds are important. Vote out all sitting incumbents.",

They will come down like a brick on any mayor who would like to censure them for killing any innocents etc.\n\nCorrupt/killer cops getting paid leave, rehired, and pension reinstated after heinous crimes etc. Immunity from the law is certainly part of that, but there needs to be an entire structure of corrupt police doing all that rehiring,of departments completely willing to be complicit in such a thing.

Oh and you can't make new case law because QI has to be decided before discovery.\n\nThe specifics of the ruling state \n&gt;\tG]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n\nDiscretionary being things that the official can choose to do or not do. Not things that are required as part of their job. \n\nFor example, they already can't be sued for handcuffing someone because that's in general a required task as a cop. But on the other hand they have discretion in choosing how they detain you and kneeling on someone's neck is not required by cops and therefore could potentially fall under QI if the Judge decides that there isn't a clear constitutional or statutory right. If they get the right conservative judge though he/she could decide it doesn't violate anything and toss it out under QI.",

People are fucking stupid and you have to assume everyone you see is a window licking moron and write all rules and laws as clear as possible.  Any room for interpretation will lead to them shoving those batteries up their ass because hey it said I cant ingest but it doesnt say anything about suppository.  I think high school should really be used to evaluate people who want to join any position that gives you a gun.  How many people were bullies growing up and ran out of people to terrorize so they find a position of power elsewhere to keep up their status quo of being the biggest douche in the room.  Now add a gun and badge to that equation.",

I understand someone could harm themselves with a blanket but there has got to be a better way than putting them in a dungeon until processing has been completed. \n\nAnd also how they like to mix prisoners of different gang affiliations in the same processing cell (the rock). No blankets or mats there either. 30 people inside, two are fighting so of course you need to spray everyone inside with some chemical irratant and shut the door and hope it calms things down. Oh the water dont work either but the trustees will have that fixed in 48 hours. So many bodys in one cell a dude has to move his head if he dont wanna get urinated on.\n\nThere is nothing uplifting about chattanooga police. This is a political PR stunt. More will follow im sure.",

You can use police of that force to *arrest* police in that force (otherwise you'd need 2 forces everywhere) but the processing, investigation, and punishments must be coordinated from another authority.

You have to remember: human suffering was not viewed in the same way back then as we do today.

One could even argue that extrajudicial mass killing *was* the norm back then. The gruesomeness of the Nazi\u2019s changed everything. The great powers vowed that nothing like this should ever be allowed to happen again and voil\u00e1 the UN was born. Then Stalin came to power.

There are a lot of politicians, including Democrats, and police that will try to put a bandaid over this to try to manage symptoms. The problem is that they don't want to address the underlying disease. That being essentially that the police are symptom management for our hyper capitalist society, not a public service",

FAFSA is different than taxes so filing independent on your taxes means nothing in regards to FAFSA.

There might be one or two more rare exceptions but long story short: yes. They will include your parents income. ",

I live off campus so my living expenses are lower, ~$7000/year. My total cost of attendance is going to be ~$15,000 for the year if you include the living expenses.\n\nMy little brother will be a freshman next year, so he's required to live on campus in the dorms by rule. That means he's required to have a meal plan. His room and board are going to cost him ~$12K, plus the tuition. So he's looking at ~$20,000 paid directly to the university for his freshman year as an in-state student.",

If the government had not insisted everyone and their mother be able to go to college, we wouldn't have this problem. 80+% of tuition would be state funded and your tuition would be 4 - 5k/yr for a top state University. Instead, states saw the opportunity to make budget cuts to University funding because hey, they can just take out fed loans.. and here we are.\n\nMy University had so much construction and waste you'd think it was Dubai.",

That said, after i graduated I started getting involved in initiatives that tie into financial aid, and they really drop the ball sometimes. often they'll reward poor planning, and fail to take bigger factors than just income into account. For instance, theyll look at a kid from nebraska whos parents make 65k and kid from manhattan or new jersey who's parents make 90k and the kid from Nebraska will tend to receive more aid despite the fact his family makes 33% more than the median income, and other kid actually makes just about the median household income and probably has a lesser quality of life or opportunity to save. \n\nsavings is also an issue, as i said they often reward poor planning. say theres in a kid in alabama that has a 529 plan with a decent ammount of money in it, and his family makes 60k a year, then there is a kid, also from alabama, whos parents make  a little more money, but dont have a lick of savings. These are the really dumb cases where they will 'make it work' for the kid with zero savings, and not think twice about making the other kid pay as much as he can from his 529 plan. \n\nedit: also meant to use 'grant' instead of aid, as thats where a lot of the money comes from with some of these need blind schools or schools with large endowments.

Literally 5% of all universities can afford to pay for full rides for all athletes and they still don't give it to all athletes, mainly football and basketball. You get partial scholarships everywhere else. So yeah I got an extra $8k a year for sports, but combine that with the amount of hours and NCAA restrictions.

I recently got a job that resulted in a $8k annual raise, however my net usable income is significantly lower now because of a number of factors, one of which is the loss of benefits.\n\nFirst we lost housing assistance completely. This was the biggest loss of usable income. This program had helped us immensely. My wife and I lost medical but our children are still covered (my employer offers medical but we pay a bit out of pocket out of it and there are larger co-pays). We lost energy assistance.\n\nOn top of that I am required to contribute to retirement, which seems good because my employer contributes 2 times my contribution up to a point, but I won't get access to that contribution unless I stay here for three years and at this pay that simply is not possible.\n\nI roughly calculated that while I'm getting paid an extra ~$600 per month gross income, I'm actually netting $500 less now.\n\nThis essentially means that I'm netting $6,000 less per year because I got a job that pays $8,000 more... it's getting hard to meet basic necessities suddenly when before we were actually able to save from month to month.\n\nAll of this adds a lot of stress to my daily life. I spend a significant amount of time budgeting and worrying about money. I just had unexpected expenses for my wife's car that needed to be covered. Fortunately we have some in savings but right now I can't see how we could possibly replace that money spent because we just don't have any extra cash. I fear that all of this is impacting my health as I've started experiencing anxiety attacks and it's impacted my overall mood.\n\nIt's an awful place to be.\n\nI'm resolved to climb out of this gorge, but right now it really sucks. I love my current job, I love doing research and working on projects that benefit the environment and humans alike, but I simply don't get paid enough and I'm looking for work elsewhere because we simply can't afford to keep living like this.",

It's additional help on top of what financial aid would normally be given.\n\nEvery student should fill out FAFSA, and most students will get some form of aid.

We're awesome sauce come to school here!\" game. NY is doing this crap too. Free tuition for extremely limited slivers of income is not the answer to any of our problems in education. \n\nI didn't even qualify for grants and aid back when I went to college because my parents were still going through the divorce process and I had to count both of their incomes. So $50k and $30k equals \"Estimated Family Contribution of: Go Fuck Yourself\". I'd fall in the same place for this.\n\nWas ridiculous seeing \"Estimated Family Contribution\" in the thousands every semester. \n\nACTUAL family contribution: $0\n\nPrivate loans got me through college. \n",

It is a sliding scale...those that make $56k and less have EFC of $0 and thus they get full grants for tuition. $57k income families might have an EFC of $1k so they will get most of their tuition covered but not all(lets say they will get $50k in aid for example sake), $60k income families may have EFC of $2k and they have to pay a bit more (lets say they will get $48k in aid) , etc, It is not an ALL OR NOTHING situation.\nSource: I am a college counselor at a high school in Illinois. University of Illinois Urbanna Champaign does the same exact thing for families under $50k.",

Those students will get left out to dry and still incur crippling debt.  We need to find another way to do these things than to pass the buck onto other middle class families.

The full board is expected to approve the proposed increases on Friday, The AP reported.\n\nEDIT: The posted article appears to actually be incorrect in my quoted portion. According to the [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-uw-madison-free-tuition-program-20180208-story.html) the increases are for non-resident and graduate tuition for three schools *in the UW system* not at UW-Madison itself.\n\n&gt; Nonresident undergraduate tuition at UW-Eau Claire would increase by $355 to $15,636. Nonresident undergraduate tuition for the materials science and engineering program would increase by $391 to $17,107. Tuition for nonresident graduate students at UW-Eau Claire would increase $430 to $17,621.\n\n&gt; Tuition for nonresident students in UW-Milwaukee's business school would increase $539 to $27,490.\n\n&gt; Nonresident graduate tuition at UW-Stout would increase by $296 to $15,088. Nonresident graduate students who pay Minnesota tuition rates under Wisconsin's reciprocity agreement with that state would have to pay $157 more, bringing their bill to $8,024. Nonresident grad students under the Midwest Student Exchange Program, in which schools agree to charge students no more than 150 percent of the in-state rate, would see their tuition go up by $166 to $10,471.",

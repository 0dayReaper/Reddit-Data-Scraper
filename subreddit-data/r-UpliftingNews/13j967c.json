If I mindlessly predict there will be no shark attacks for each day for each mile of beach, I should be &gt;99.9% correct because the base rate of shark attacks is so low. Does anyone know how they came up with 89%?",

If it is only 120 days or 180 days then not so much.",

            "comment": "This is a pretty good teachable moment for talking about the accuracy of an AI system.\n\nSay it has 89% accuracy -- that means, 11% of the time, it's wrong? That seems not great for predicting potentially fatal events.\n\nBut this brings up at least two important points. First off, are all kinds of errors the same here?\n\nSay you're building a \"this person is bringing a bomb into the secured area\" detector. If you accidentally trigger when they do not actually have a bomb, an innocent person gets a pat-down and a human being looks in their bag. Not the end of the world, but inconvenient. An error in the other direction (there was a bomb but the system missed it) is a bigger problem! \n\nAnd secondly -- my understanding is that shark attacks are super rare. What kind of an accuracy would the system get if it just always said \"nope, don't worry about sharks today\"? Probably higher than 89%. Would that be useful? ...",

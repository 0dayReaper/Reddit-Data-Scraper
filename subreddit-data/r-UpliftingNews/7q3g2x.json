He will have trouble finding a fulfilling relationship because the ones who are genuinely attracted to him for him will be lost in the sea of hot gold diggers and sugar babies. After getting burnt by these girls, each time he meets someone new who he\u2019s really attracted to, he\u2019ll always have a suspicion that they are just after the lifestyle that he can provide for them.\n\nSoon he\u2019ll be in his thirties and spiraling down into depression as he\u2019s stuck in this limbo of dating and still playing the field, just because the turnover rate of girls is about one or two new ones per week. No long lasting meaningful relationship is ever formed. There probably were people who like him for him, but he mistakenly thought that she was another gold digger, or he pushed her away with his \u201cgold digger tests\u201d, or he didn\u2019t find her as attractive as some of the models/gold diggers he slept with before.\n\nAnd this is an ongoing problem with everything, because the money has made him jaded. Things that were acceptable once before like a small TV or small house aren\u2019t adequate anymore. Everything will taste worse than the seven-course meals he ate at those three Michelin-starred restaurants. Every experience will feel lame compared to the crazy things he\u2019s done when he traveled the world and splurged. Every car he drives will feel slow and cheap compared to his Lamborghini\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s. He has done it all already in his 20s. He has spoiled himself.\n\nHe wishes he could tell people about his depression. But nobody can relate. Some tell him that he has no right to complain because others are struggling to pay their bills. They all just tell him to appreciate what he has or to give his money to them. He makes a strong effort to do that, but it still doesn\u2019t help his loneliness. And talking about it only backfires. Nobody has any sympathy for him, and it isolates him more from the world.\n\nHe sometimes wonders if the money is a curse. He constantly worries about people robbing him or stealing from him. He has frequent nightmares of people breaking into his house. So now he sleeps with an assault rifle and pistol next to his pillow. It didn\u2019t help. The nightmares still haunt him. He just had one this morning and it woke him up. And now he\u2019s on his phone, sitting in his bed, and typing some long reddit comment with no satisfying ending. Because that\u2019s the curse of the hedonic treadmill; he will never be satisfied.",

He took care of his immediate family, and proceeded to waste the rest of the money.\n\nI truly hope this kid has a good head on his shoulders, and a good family behind him.

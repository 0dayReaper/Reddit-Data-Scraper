You can't fire off an ICBM without everyone assuming it's nuclear. The whole launch platform is forever tied to the idea of nukes. Using one invites a trigger happy nation to guess wrong at your intentions.",

When you build an empire based on corruption, you shouldn't be surprised when you find out most of your military spending was actually being stolen by corrupt generals and their oligarch friends.\n\nThe Russian Navy wouldn't stand a chance against the UK and France, let alone the rest of Europe. And all of NATO? Every Russian ship would be bottled up in port or on the bottom of the ocean in under a week.\n\nThe Russians do not have any significant number of 5th generation fighters, and their older equipment would be in a lot of trouble with all the Stinger missiles that are being shipped in.\n\nAnd we can see from the videos the state of their Army equipment- poorly maintained and out of date- and they can't even keep the stuff fueled.

You want overwhelming superiority and you want to crush your enemy before they have time to see your plans and react. You don't send in weak troops that give the enemy free target practice, give them time to learn to work together, let them see your plans, and for sympathetic nations to send in weapons and ammunition.\n\nYou fight a war the way the US fought the First Gulf War or the way Germany started WW2. You build up overwhelming equipment and troops- and you hit hard and you hit all at once. Shock and awe. You don't give your enemy any time to react, and you don't give them any opportunity to dig in.\n\nRussia spent a lot of time amassing these troops so it's not like they couldn't have brought forth their best troops and equipment. So this is the best they could do, or they are unbelievably incompetent.\n\nEither way- it's a completely embarrassment for Russia and a clear sign that they wouldn't stand a chance against NATO.",

Beyond even a measured response with conventional weapons, the country is in the stone age. No trade partners whatsoever, so freedom of movement, no access to any resource provided by a non Russian source. As much as putin might claim he would have nothing to lose, he'd be surrounded by hundreds of millions with even less to lose. That never ends well.\n\n Someone might bring up north Korea as an example of a ruling class maintaining control under those circumstances, but there's a huge difference.  Russians would be losing a lot, while north Koreans never had any of it to begin with. \n\nGo full gonzo and that's a wrap for the planet. His best case scenario would be finding a bunker to hide in and hoping that he can trust every single person locked in there with him. I wouldn't put any money on that being the case.",

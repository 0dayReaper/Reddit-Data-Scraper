This means that since 2005 the Democratic party has had control of both the executive and legislative branches of the Colorado State Government for 8 of the last 15 years. \n\nIt should also be added that the Republican wing in Colorado politics has tended to be more moderate compared to Republicans nationally. \n\nSource: Worked in Colorado politics, also you can google the Colorado election results and prior sessions.",

Wanna fix the economy, how about a $20 trillion infrastructure spending bill partnering with American owned and operated businesses and job training for American citizens, oh and $20 billion if that will go to the wall, because how can you pass in American jobs? Let's support the police by reducing their stupid interactions: let's legalize marijuana, apply sin tax to it, and free up prison space by freeing and wiping non violent marijuana charges. It costs something like $40k/year to feed and how prisoners , so we're also reducing spending and UBI. Let's invest in small business and let's repeal and replace Obamacare and pass Romneycare as it was originally designed: government option included, has the added benefit of reducing the cost of healthcare for large firms. Let's return America to the 50s and 60s tax brackets to balance the budget, reduce the deficit. It means tightening our necktie a bit, but it's to ensure we still have a waist to put a belt. Lets find teachers, and offer more than just college as post secondary education. Let's invest in trade schools for the jobs bill. Let's build a sustainable national economy that builds in abundance for international trade.\n\nIt's so easy to couch \"liberal\" policies in conservative terms and undermine the left, and they don't. It's politics, the actual solutions are apolitical, it's all about couching and rephrasing, and they don't understand this. Either side.",

The fact is before prohibition, many men would get drunk on liquor and beat their wives. Prohibition and women's rights went hand and hand. As a result of prohibition, and the technology improvements in the interem after prohibition the alcohol market shifted. Beer became more popular, since it's cheaper, and refrigeration and canning made it easier to transport. Spirits declined in consumption. Cultural norms were changed around alcohol for an entire generation with positive results.",

Your comment is bascialy \"whoops, guess arresting hundreds of thousands of people ever single year was dumb. our bad hahahah\". \n\nThe harm done, millions of people who had their lives pointlessly disrupted in a way that will impact them for the remainder, needs to be recognized and rectified. The entire abusive industry built around those arrests needs to be dismantled.  Want \"I'm a conservative and...\" points? Support that change and don't vote for fuckers who oppose it.\n\nAlso lets be honest. We both know you're not planning to vote for a candidate with decriminalization on their platform.

Think about how many children if criminals may fail to pass a background check because of their parents, missing out on specialized jobs where their perspective could matter? We need to have a cultural shift around how we consider formerly incarcerated citizens, who've paid the penalty for their crimes but have lifelong punishments that often do not fit the crime. You got a parking ticket, could afford to pay, your car gets impounded, you can't see the judge so you have a warrant out for failing to appear. The fines get even larger, you can't work. Maybe you gotta feed your family, so you steal something, except youre bad at it get caught. You can't afford a lawyer and the overworked public defender advises you to plead out, for a class c felony. You do your time and now you can't find a job, but you did make criminal connections inside who will hook you up with a shady job so you can take care of your kids. Maybe if we funded the DA and the Public defender office from the same budget split in the middle, there would be more justice for 90% of people. Maybe if prisons were about reform and job training with counseling, personal wellness education, and job placement,prisoners finishing their time can go right into a job to make them the money to not need to fall back into crime. Most of crime is a matter of economics plain and simple. If people had legal access and ability to work and make the kind of money they want, they'd do it. If people could get access to legal products instead of illegal products they would.",

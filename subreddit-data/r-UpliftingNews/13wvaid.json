The sewing program helps to provide an income to a really poor area.  We just got a donation from one of our board members of five sewing machines in honor of Tommy Raskin, the son of Congressman Jamie Raskin.\n\n[https://nsefu.org/news/2023/5/22/a-song-of-thanks-from-the-sewing-team](https://nsefu.org/news/2023/5/22/a-song-of-thanks-from-the-sewing-team)\n\nWe're always looking for volunteers, but don't have the \"infrastructure\" set up to bring volunteers to Zambia. But if interested, there are ways to do this, please email me at bill@nsefu.org. \n\nThanks, Bill.",

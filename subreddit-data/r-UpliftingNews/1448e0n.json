But such a tiny population will create genetic problems down the line making them even more vulnerable.\nIt's a good job this is a cute mammal, they'll need all the human support possible to have a chance of recovering to a healthy level.",

The US may sanction Mexico due to not really doing much to help protect these little animals.\nSo it's mostly luck that there are 13 instead of 8...\n\nDid they put those underwater hooks in to stop Chinese fishing boats from poaching fish, or specifically to protect the vaquita?",

While the exact reason for no gillnet vessels being observed within the ZTA is unknown, the \r\nsimplest explanation would be that the concrete blocks and hooks, in combination with the \r\ncollaborative efforts by the Mexican Navy and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (SSCS) to remove \r\nthe few fishermen who were willing to risk their nets by deploying them inside the ZTA, is working. The \r\napparent 90%+ decrease in gillnetting within the last stronghold of vaquitas is probably the most \r\nsignificant step taken to date toward saving the species.\n\nAlso from the report:\n\n&gt;If a line-transect survey were carried out utilizing the same ship as in past \r\nsurveys (the David Starr Jordan/Ocean Starr), an estimate of abundance would be possible with \r\nrelatively few sightings, because the probability of detection is known for this ship. However, chartering \r\nthis vessel and hiring experienced observers for the necessary time would be expensive, at least \r\nUS$3,000,000 for a survey.\n\nIt's hell expensive, might be a reason why the current administration gives zero f***k about the vaquita",

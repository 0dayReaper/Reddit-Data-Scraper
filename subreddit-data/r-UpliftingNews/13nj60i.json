Hell I think anyone who likes the idea of gene therapy wishes for some kind of genetic improvement, in which case who has the right to say looking like another sex is any worse than wanting huge muscles or demon horns or whatever.\n\nI guess that could be a problematic example overall, so maybe another example is that scientists definition of \"fruits\" and culinary definitions of \"fruits\" are different - scientists found empirical categories while culinary classifies them by historical precedent and usage/purpose in cooking. Both groupings are useful and valid but it would take a certain kind of \"arrogance\" to say one is better than the other.",

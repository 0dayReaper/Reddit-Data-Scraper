In the 90's some legal challenges made adolescents effectively above the law - they had to be released the same day they were picked up. So enterprising adults created gangs of kids to commit crimes of opportunity like swarming tourists. \n\nBusinesses responded by hiring off-duty cops to mete out punishment, which was usually fatal. The vigilantism got bad enough that it was a challenge to official law enforcement. Eventually the government adopted a hands off attitude, and let police do whatever they felt was necessary. \n\nSo the big question now is, are there sufficient economic opportunities to ensure that kids don't engage in en masse street crime. If so, this might be the basis for a new social peace. If not, death rates by cop might go down, but vigilantism might take it's place.",

The body cam thing is a good move and I hope it stays, but they've also been investing more in policing in general and creating better strategies etc. So if you look at the data, you see a steady and significant decrease in crimes (especially more serious crimes like murder) over the years.\n\nThis is in contrast to places like Rio, where crime rates aren't decreasing and in fact might be a bit on the rise due to pandemic effects.\n\nI currently live and work in the US but I'm considering moving to S\u00e3o Paulo because, frankly, I feel I have more quality of life there than here at this point.

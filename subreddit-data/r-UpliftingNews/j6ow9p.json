The chancellor was generally a politiciean from either the federal parliment or one of the reigonal ones. Adolf Hitler was the leader of the largest party in the parliment so giving him the title of chancellor wasn't a crazy thing to do. It was a largely cerimonial position that didn't give much in terms of power. Up to this point the Nazis mostly played by the rule since the failed coup in the 20s. The walkouts and constant votes of no confidence were shady to say the least but allowed in Weimar Germany's terrible system.\n\nWhen Hindenburg died which would have usually triggered an election, Hitler claimed that the country was too weak for an election. The reichstag had just burned down and was blamed squarely on communists, the people's fear allowed him to take the office of president \"temporarily\" without much backlash and with control of parliment and the presidency he had basically total control of Germany.\n\nSaying he was never elected is true but a bit misleading. Hitler took power through political movement and luck while Mussolini literally marched to the kings house and threatened to shoot him if he didn't become leader.",

The office of dictator was only used for 6 months at a time and was then relinquished either forcibly or by the dictators own hand. During this time the dictators could do anything they wanted bar passing laws or forcing people into slavery. So calling the dictators of the 20th century the same as dictators of the Roman republic is false and should not be done",

An unrestricted democracy with a marketplace of ideas allows ideas to be \"sold\" - like fascism - that themselves advocate for the destruction of democracy and the marketplace of ideas. And there is, obviously, a non-trivial segment of society to whom fascist ideology appeals. Which means that in a democratic system which places no ideological restrictions on the people who can be elected, fascists will have representation in government, even as they advocate for the destruction of that government. And, of course, an ideology which does not value democracy will abolish it if it is democratically elected to power. \n\nThis is what Karl Popper called the \"paradox of tolerance\". Intolerant ideologies should ideally be suppressed via argument in the marketplace. However, when an ideology starts doing things like trying to forbid its followers from listening to the argument in the marketplace (for example, by calling the discussions going on there \"fake news\"), it may not be possible to prevent takeover of society by the intolerant through words alone. If an ideology teaches its followers that disagreements are solved through force, then those followers will not be susceptible to persuasion and a tolerant society may ultimately be forced to stop tolerating that ideology.",

Denmark had very lenient terms and even got to keep our own government until the persecution of jews started in 1943, when the government and parliament dissolved themselves in response. Resistance to the occupation was somewhat limited until 1943 when sabotage actions and snitch-executions started to ramp up, mainly by KOPA, later BOPA, and Holger Danske.",

            "comment": "We need to understand that we are (wrongly) identifying the Fascist movement with just the German Nazi movement and name. To summarize, Fascism was really a precursor to Hitler's German National Socialist party movement (the  \"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\"). Fascism was \"invented\" by Benito Mussolini in Italy and named after Italian peasant revolutionary bands (\"Fasci di Combattimento\"). Since Italy was in such a terrible shape after the first world war Mussolini sold the message that togetherness and complete obedience to the leader (\"Il Deuce\") was the way to go.\n\nIn any case, there is Fascism all over the world, manifested in different forms and different degrees.\n\nIn many respects Trump's philosophy encompasses fascist elements and thought. Many of his minions and his supporters, including his mouthpieces, show clear fascist leanings. It would be too lengthy to describe all such elements here -  but here are a few: (1) Only the leader can fix what is wrong with the country. (2) All objective (non-party line) news are \"fake news\" and should be ridiculed and suppressed. (3) Everyone not part of the movement is weak and should be shunned. (4) All foreigners or non racially pure folks are dirty and disgusting criminals and should be kept out of the country (build a wall to halt immigration) and expelled from society (exile or concentration camp - take your pick) etc. etc.. (please read up on Fascism and you will see many more examples of this).\n\nSo maybe we can have a trial similar to this here, after we kick Trump out of office. It would certainly be cathartic and it would allow our democracy to get rid of the scum and become again the \"...shining city on the hill...\"\n\nSo, VOTE!",

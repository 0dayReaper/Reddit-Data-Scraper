But it also doesn't mean that shouldn't be taking steps to stop it everywhere. How do you consider it a punishment to curb imports? Is the EU/US obligated to help develop other countries' economies by growing their exports?",

Why can't they use their natural resources? because they have exhausted them and only the undeveloped countries has them (natural florest and such)",

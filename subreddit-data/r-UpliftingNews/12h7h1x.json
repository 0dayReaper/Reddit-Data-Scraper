Look at Texas that had three dozen deaths due to a failed grid and lack of regulation, and how they did nothing to fix it and it happened again.  Clearly we need improvements but they aren't going to happen if we don't push forward with EVs.",

People would tune into his show, watch his monologue, then go to the bathroom and get ready for bed during the long set of commercials that followed. The timing was followed by a large percentage of the city and water pressure dropped to a very low place during \"The Carson Flush\".  It was an example of everybody timing something where randomness is required.\n\nAnother was in subdivision houses where builders rolled out thousands of nearly identical houses, each with sprinkler timers set by the same manual so each came on at the same time.  All those houses in the same area caused water pressure  drops together and the government sent  cards to these houses encouraging them to pick a different time.\n\nI don't have much experience in EV grids, but I can tell you water stories mean you can't just tell people to do one thing and hope they have variety.",

It also has a fun hole shot when I feel inclined to drive it that way. It can also replace my backup generator.\n\nPointing out that EVs are \"just as bad as gas, but different\" isn't going to convince many. At \"just as bad as gas,\" it's still a step into the future. Hopefully battery tech will continue to evolve and become greener, but I'm going to drive electric either way.

Republicans are opposing it, obviously. but the companies that actually need to transition away from ICE cars like Ford, Dodge, Honda, etc. are all backing these changes. They think they can compete with Tesla and Rivian in terms of price and technology,  despite being late off the starting line, and given the amount of money invested, I\u2019m inclined to  believe them. \n\nWith that kind of backing and investment there is new technology improvements in EV technology every day, and with the money from government initiatives there is a damn good chance public EV infrastructure will grow to keep up with demand. \n\nSo yeah, take the fucking W people.

At this point, I don't see the need to get an EV and have a high car payment.  \nWould rather stick to a hybrid as they don't need charging, and I dont have a garage to charge it safely in.  I loved my Kia Niro.  Favorite car I've ever had.   (There aren't many charging stations near me, the closest is an Applebee's with level 2 charger.  I live in a big city in the south)    \nIf they do pass this, they'll need to make charging stations more accessible.   The lack of stations and charge time/milage is also concerning if I need to evacuate for a hurricane.  Evacuating is pretty much sitting in a parking lot for hours due to over-population and mass panic.  Also, the distance to get somewhere to stay for awhile.",

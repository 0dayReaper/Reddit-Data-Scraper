It seems to look like someone who has down syndrome but when I say someone I mean it looks like a Barbie who has it. I don't mean for any of this to be offensive. Humans have down syndrome so I think Barbie did a good job getting this face to match. People who have down syndrome May not all look the same. But I think this company had a plan and the designer (who may have another name) did a good or great job making the design come out as a mold. I say good and great. Maybe to someone it's not. Maybe if I compared to another Barbie or a real person it wouldn't be good or great. But for now I'm saying that. Molds which I think Barbie is, Barbie is plastic can melt, and be cut wrong. They can be cut to much. Just adding that in here. And a person or people had to also had color to this.",

In recent years, the company has moved to deviate from that reputation by offering more diverse dolls. It started making Barbie and Ken dolls with wheelchairs, vitiligo, hearing aids, and prosthetic limbs. The company unveiled its \"most diverse doll line\" in its 2023 Fashionistas lineup, which includes the doll with Down syndrome.",

Barbie is showing the kids who have vitiligo, or are in wheelchairs, that either Barbie can be like them, or it's giving those kids a similarly. I can say a lot on this but I think it's good that those kids can look at a Barbie package and see a Barbie in a wheelchair if the kid who wants a Barbie is in a wheelchair and be able to buy one. Then the kid can have a relationship with the Barbie Doll. That's what's going on my mind with these toys. Kids sometimes need relationships with Barbies or other toys. At least I think my generation had relationships with toys. Maybe not everybody. But it's good to see this. Years ago in 2000 I didn't see a Barbie in a wheelchair or with down syndrome but I also didn't look. So yay for 2023 and new Barbies!!! And yes Yay I sound like I'm a special education student. Or I'm Special Ed from Crank Yankers. Peace Y'all.",

This aren't made for adults so it doesn't need to please us. Are the kids happy? Seems so. Just let them enjoy it.   \nBarbie isn't made to be realistic with leg hair (what a great complaint in this thread..) she's still a doll, she's still fantasy. Kids don't need to play with a copy of themshelves it's enough they can relate if they want to.   \n\n\nShit like this has progressed so much from my Barbie age (80's). But even then I knew Barbie was a doll and not presenting reality. To be honest my body issues came more from the dolls stores use to show clothes :D",

Adults like talking and saying things that aren't right or nice. Even if it's towards Barbies. I think that's a big issue that we have today in our adult community. One, the kids are listening to the adults talk bad and mean about the toys they are playing with. Don't you think that makes the kids feel bad? I do. And maybe at certain ages like 5 or 2, or 6 it doesn't. But to some kids it might. To talk about parents, I think kids want their parents to like what they have to. Kids in my mind look up to their parents, literally and another way. When a kid is hearing the adults talking they are listening. In my eyes a lot of kids are being ignored at young ages and maybe older. It's a problem to me that can be fixed by paying attention to what your child is saying, and thinking. I could go on. I was around some Barbies to stay in topic. I'm glad the company is still in business. Hopefully any kid who wants one gets one for  Christmas coming up or a special occasion.",

Not at all because it was an ideal of how they wanted to be, it was just a friend that they could dress up and play with without feeling like the person was judging them. They seek out dolls with traits that match their own. Hair color, eye color. Short. Tall. Skin color. Thinner or larger. Now they can seek this out, if they want to. Its not like mattel is telling them they have to play with Down Syndrome Barbie. Just that its an option and that barbie can still be all those things the barbie sets allow and still be beautiful and smart and fun and a friend, with down syndrome. \n\nI had one girl who was 14 who was always talking about how the baby dolls didnt look like her. One day she was gifted a doll that was altered to look more like her, with downs apparent. She was so over the moon she never stopped hugging it or taking it everywhere and showing it off. \n\nKids are learning to become adults, and dolls help them explore that.",

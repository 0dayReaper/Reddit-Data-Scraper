When I  read the article, it all came across as me me me from the parents side.\nMaybe I\u2019m being cynical, but I really do feel like children should be involved in things. Adults seem to think that children don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t comprehend things but remember when you were children and felt like life was unfair? You comprehended it then, you understood I then, you  may not have had the  grown-up words to express something but you understood.\n\nAlso, I wonder how much the operation cost for the family.",

                            "comment": "This issue is right in my wheelhouse as I've been working with data on patents and lobbying, which are two big reasons why insulin is so expensive\n\nThe first big reason is that 3 companies control something like 90% of the Insulin market. The reason there's so little competition is a practice known as \"evergreening\" in which companies take advantage of loopholes in the U.S. patent system to \"build thickets\" of patents around their drugs which will make them last much longer.\n\nI've been building a [dashboard tracking patents](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/) by publicly traded companies and if you search the ticker \"SNY\" (Sanofi) you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nThe other big reason is lobbying. Pharma companies spend millions of dollars essentially buying votes to ensure that minimal legislative action is taken against price-gouging.\n\n[Here's a dashboard](https://www.quiverquant.com/lobbyingsearch/) I've been building tracking corporate lobbying. You can search any pharma company (e.g. \"PFE\" for Pfizer) to see what specific pieces of legislation they're throwing money at.\n\nYou can see a graph I made [here](https://www.quiverquant.com/sources/lobbying) comparing the lobbying spending of all the companies I track. The only industry that I can say is more active in lobbying than pharma is defense contractors.",

                                    "comment": "I honestly fear that there is currently to much focus on the big pharmacy companies and not the complicated system of middle men, that increases the prices. The truth is that these companies only have limited competition all over the world, but it is only in the USA that you see these outrageous prices.\n\nA lot of Novo Nordisk research and production happens in what is called the medicon valley. An area of eastern Denmark and southern Sweden. Here people have been outrage against Novo Nordisk, because of the high insulin prices in the USA. People should not be dying because they can\u2019t afford something as cheap as insulin.\n\nThe CEO of Novo-nordisk(Lars) have engaged with the public in a number of back and forth Letters to the editor of several newspapers. [Here](https://www.berlingske.dk/laesere/novo-nordisk-vi-er-bevidst-om-vores-samfundsansvar ) is one of the letters. Lars (The CEO of Novo Nordisk) say that Novo Nordisk earns the same on insuline at the american market as on every other market. The listed price is just higher, because the bulkbuyers demands increased discount each year and so the listed price have to increase each year.\n\nIt actuelly goes very well with my experience and knowledge of bulkbuyers in the american market. Bulkbuyers in general used to just buy in bulk, get a discount and then resell the products. Some times it was worth using a bulkbuyer. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t. Then a few decades ago bulkbuyers in the USA started to change practice. Bulkcompanies would get hired by the company that needed a given product, by saying that they could get a better discount and that the companies would just have to pay them a small percentage of the discount. It is an easy sell. We get you a discount, then you pay us a percentage of the discount or else you can just pay the listed price of the company.\n\nThe problem was that when these bulkcompanies had gained almost monopoly on a market, because the only way that the bulkbuyers could increase their profit was by demanding more and more discount each year. Manufactores would then increase listed prices by the same amount each year and still earn the same amount. The problem is that Bulkbuyers actuelly want manufactures to raise the listed price, because that increase how much their discount is worth and thus their profit. It also kind of catches the companies who needs the products. They have to stay with the bulkcompany, since the original product is now to expensive to buy without the bulkcompany.\n\nSo let us say that Novo-nordic sells a drug for $30. The bulkcompany comes in and say that they can get it cheaper but want 20% of the discount. Over the next decade they demand a greater and greater discount, the manufacture agrees to the discount, but raises the listed price. The listed price of the drug is now $300, but the bulkcompany gets a 90% discount, so the pharmacy can still buy the druge for $30 from the manufacture, but the bulkcompany get 20% of the now $270 discount, which is $54. A cost that is then pushed to the consumer.\n\nThese numbers might seem extreme, but [this](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/amerikaner-i-desperat-opraab-efter-nye-prisstigninger-fra-novo-de ) article in a danish business newspaper looks at some of the numbers for Novo-nordic and even with a 370% price increase, Novo-nordisks profit on insuline on the american market have not even followed inflation, because they are giving almost 80% discount to the bulkcompanies. A huge discount that the bulk companies are paid for and that pay is then moved to the consumer.\n\nIn other letters and articles Lars have talked about the problems Novo Nordisk have faced trying to bring cheap generic insuline to the american public. Novo Nordisk had according to him tried to find partners for years, before they were able to sell human insuline through Walmart. None of their normal partners wanted to take part in it, because while it could bring cheaper insuline to the consumers it might cut down their profit.\n\nOf course what he says should be taken with a grain of salt. He is after all the CEO of Novo Nordisk, but on the other hand he doesn\u2019t get that much out of lying about the american market to a danish audience. His articles paint the american healthcare system as unnecessary complicated, bloated and fundamentally flawed, with need for governmental intervention to bring it back in control, so that it serves the population and not the companies.",

Its so rare to see anyone mention the middle men, that honestly must LOVE all the attention \"big pharma\" gets, while they rake in profits.\n\nI normally have a reply very much like yours ive used in a few threats like these, becuase i honestly feel that many americans are focusing their dislike the wrong way and its not doing them any good. Its, in my mind, their entire healthcare platform that is crooked.\n\nHere is what i normally post;\n\n&gt;  Focusing on the wrong part of the problem will never fix the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you look in to the insulin issue it's an American issue and not a world wide issue. However, non of the insulin brands are American. Somehow the manufacturer gets blamed for extreme pricing on insulin. Did you ever stop to think that the American model was the problem? How come it's covered in the rest of the developed world. How come it's cheap in Canada and expensive in the US? Is there an alternative? Are they simply mean? \n&gt; \n&gt; Well maybe and maybe not. How ever, Novo Nordisk has time and time again been praised for being one of the best Places to work. Their previous CEO was named the best in the world multiple years. And not because he drove big profits. Because he was very humane and down to earth. Good guy.  [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fortune.com/2016/10/12/novo-nordisk-ceo-best-performing-harvard-business-review/amp/)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When the topic was in the media last time, Novo got a lot of heat for pushing up the prices. And sure, they do it to make a profit and sure it could probably be lower. But the reason for the constant price increase is that the companies that negotiate on behalf of the insurances in the US (the PBM), constantly requires higher % discount every year. And if they don't oblige, they go with the competition (Sanofi, Eli Lilly or Mylan) so Novo (and sanofi and so on) increased their discount every year, but that also causes them to increase msrp. Otherwise it won't work. The American gov. Also increase the tax on medication year for year. On avarage they (Novo) gave 71% discount last year in US [source 1](https://m.medwatch.dk/article/11923659)\n&gt; [source 2](https://borsen.dk/nyheder/virksomheder/novo-nordisk-gav-75-mia-kr-i-rabat-i-2015)\n&gt; [source 3](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/penge/grafik-saadan-skummer-amerikanske-medicin-indkoebere-floeden-hos-novo)\n&gt; [source 4](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/novo-topchef-i-forsvar-efter-priskritik-fra-usa-vi-giver-rabatter-for)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sources are in Danish, use Google translate.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Besides that, Novo offers programs for Americans to get medication for free diretly from Novo, and you can buy human insulin over the counter for 25$ in Walmart. (See source 4)\n&gt; They also spend billions in RnD that funds the development of the insulin available today which is actually useable. Many diabetics would not be able to survive on the OG 1$ patented insulin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So are the insulin manufactures making money? Yes. Is the American system to blame for the medicine prices in the states? Yes. Take a look at your own corrupts system so you can point the fingers in the right direction and push for the correct change\n&gt;  Because Novo lowering prices won't help. It will only cause the PBM's to go with a other brand and then you won't see Novo in USA at all. Only thing you gain from that is even less competition and maybe even higher prices.\n&gt; \n&gt; Privatized healthcare is the issue.",

What I have to say about it though is that manufacturers are certainly a part of the problem. Why give in to this broken bulk discount system which inflates their product's prices to no end? I struggle to believe that nobody saw this coming, this is elementary level maths.\n\nTo my basic understanding from your comments what I see is that the manufacturers are afraid of being pushed out of market by other companies who do give bulk discounts, therefore they need to become part of the problem to stay in business in America. Why not just collectively say \"fuck you\"? Why is this bulk discount thing so important? The manufacturers certainly don't get anything out of this.\n\nI'm probably not understanding it well yet, I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

Their profit is based on the amount of discount they can get the insurance company and the insurance companies can boast with the amount of discount that they get the individuel american consumer. Manufactors can't work together and say fuck that, because that would be illegal under most competition laws.\n\nIt seems like a lot of people have seen this coming. Some of the articles that we linked are back from the 2015 and they reffere to even older numbers. The problem have just not been taken care off, but have instead grown.\n\nI think it is hard to blame only one part of a system and Lars himself admits that they as manufactures are taking part in a broken system, but at the same time they can not fix it. The system as a whole is broken and so the fix have to be political. In [this article,](https://m.medwatch.dk/article/11314463) that I found thanks to u/TheRune and his sources, Lars suggest removing safe harbour practise that means bulkbuyers doesn't have to pass discounts on to consumers. As I understand it, it is actuelly very close to what some american politicians have been arguing for the last few months.",

Some people really only respond to certain brands/regiments that sometimes takes years of trial and error to figure out...I think some of the insulins are still under patent.\n\nIts a tough nut to crack. On one hand you do have old school insulin that does work if managed perfectly.  On the other hand medicine has come a long way in the past decade when it comes to diabetes management and the newer stuff is more user friendly which makes it easier to manage your blood sugar.",

It is sufficiently affordable that people can get it if they need it in the majority of cases. Note that for some people that are not very well off, it'll cost them a fair bit per year and it will still take a good chunk of their budget. \n\nI always get a little bit uneasy when speaking about the price of such and such that is lower here compared to the US. For example, I believe education should be completely free, even at the university level. In my province tuition will set you back like 1500-1800$ (CAD) or so a semester. Is it high compared to the US? Not at all. Is It still too high a cost for several people? Yes. Does it create additional barriers between the have and have not? Yes. Still, sometimes people throw at us that we should not want improvements or change to existing programs because in some other place it's more expensive than here.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are asking so: I'm in Quebec. As others have mentionned after I graduted they did up the institutional fees so it's not quite the right amount now but it's still in the same ballpark.",

A prescription is only required to bill it to insurance.\n\nMy son uses 30-40 units of Humalog and 25 units of Lantus each day.\n\nA box of Humalog will last us about a month. A box of Lantus gets us almost 2 months.\n\nEdit: Because it seems yall haven't seen my other comments or replies:\nThe prices listed are over the counter, without subsidy, without insurance. Our out of pocket cost is about $7 for two boxes (3000 units) of insulin (doesn't matter which kind).",

See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/l5vv6m/comment/gkx1upf\n\nPlease note that my son is 11 and his insulin requirements will increase as he grows.\n\nBased on the monthly costs detailed in my other post, if we didnt have special coverage through our province or private insurance, our total monthly cost would be about $458.50/mo (CAD) for the rest of his life.\n\nNot factoring likely cost increases, thats $275,100 CAD over 50 years.\n\nMy hope is he'll have a full life and make it to 90 or so.

The startup blew up, a real notable startup story, but of course we didn't get rich. The founders did. Then (most) of us started our own businesses. We have varying levels of success, but none of us are billionaires, to say the least. And some of these people were incredibly intelligent and charismatic. \n\nLuck. Luck is the hidden factor. You can be as hardworking and smart and charismatic as can be. You can be a fucking visionary. But if you don't happen to meet that right person at the right time, or have that random lucky break, you'll never be cuban-esque successful, or even anything close to it. Intelligence and dedication are the foundation, but luck is that magic factor that sends people to great success. \n\nIt bothers me when people like Cuban can't just step up and say \"I got mad fuckin' lucky.\" And instead push this \"I worked hard, you gotta work hard\" nonsense. It's a huge lack of self awareness, it's cockiness, and it's rather dangerous advice to tell young people to go work themselves to the bone, when 99.999% of the time, it'll lead to... nothing but misery, really. \n\nBut, I don't completely write the dude off for that. I do agree that overall, he seems like an alright guy.",

To put it bluntly, the parasites weren\u2019t even paying rent to live inside me, and I had to pay hundreds to evict them because you need at least two doses. \n\nI went to Mexico on vacation and bought Albendazole for $60 USD per pill just in case I ever need it again. (I was going back and forth to Brazil for a while and was supposed to go to rural India before covid hit, so I figured it was best to be prepared - haven\u2019t needed Albendazole again, knock on wood)\n\nIn Canada it\u2019s even cheaper at something like $2-4 USD per pill (if I remember correctly) but you need to see a doctor for the prescription which can be expensive for someone that doesn\u2019t have Canadian Medicare and needs to pay cash.",

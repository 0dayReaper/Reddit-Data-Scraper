One or two might have hits, but its rare for the bulk of the Billboard charts to see genuinely high sales like in the 90s and earlier. For instance, Adelle sold less than 2 million hard copies last year, and she was the #1. Add streaming and track purchases online, and Drake sold like 4 million units, Adele 2 million, and by the end of the top 10 in sales you're down to 1 million units all together. It falls off VERY fast after that top dozen or so anymore.\n\nFor comparison, The biggest sellers 20 years ago were 10 times that. Jagged Little Pill sold 33 million copies (15 million each in 1995-1996 and a few more after that). \n\nLabels take a crapload there, too, even though they no longer do artist development and production costs can be kept down quite a bit compared to the old days. So, even if you sell a lot of albums by modern standards, you still are lucky to recoup your expenses and if you do you're just making a few dollars here and there.\n\nAnyway, the biggest money makers are tours for a lot of these folks. Even boomer acts like the Eagles or the Stones keep going on tour because making an album just isn't worth it, while the tour can generate millions. They get a cut of tickets, a much bigger cut of merchandise, and most merch is theirs to profit off of unless they were suckered into a 360 deal by a scummy label. \n\nI'd like to say it sucks, but for Chance the Rapper it's great. This guy has an awesome live presence, he's known from his releases and that drives people to his shows, and it's working for him. I'm glad some folks make it work, and more glad this guy is doing something positive to get press. ",

He is independent because he wants no restrictions on his music and so he can connect with his audience.\n\nThe money he makes through touring and merchandise. The merchandise is on the pricier side but can you blame him? Its not super expensive as if he's selling versace but I'd say the average price for a piece of merchandise is $30-40. He's not on his own tour right now but he does do events, some free charity ones and recently a few with other artists (Life is Beautiful) with blink-182, Lorde etc. ",

His business model is a counterpoint to the big bullshit complaint that labels have with streaming services. They always complain that streaming takes away from the artist's (their) revenue but since chance is able to support himself only with streaming and touring revenue, he represents what could be a dangerous future trend to major labels.\n\nImo chance's indie success is completely the exception and not the rule, and new artists will still need to depend on labels for help, but he has consistently addressed labels very negatively in his music and interviews. It wouldnt make sense for the major labels to help him win a grammy to promote staying independent.",

Certain songs didn\u2019t get cleared; the samples that were good to go didn\u2019t get cleared\n\nWhen the interviewer asks if they do it out of spite for his independence:\n\n&gt;Yeah. And I mean, it's not like a big conspiracy theory. It's just like, niggas wanted to make money off me and I said no. In a lot of positions where it's either them getting the money or me, of course they're gonna step in the way. Also, I've in the past told people they shouldn't sign with certain people. And it's not 'cause I want them to sign with somebody else. It's just 'cause I met that person and they're not good people. So, I tell them that, and when [labels] hear that back, they tell other people bad shit about me. The cool thing is the shit about me ain't true, so I'm not worried, but it is like a little bit of a high school thing\n\nSo not exactly trying to destroy it, more like putting him down for their own artists to get more spotlight ",

If you don't listen to much rap music, then I think that you'd barely recognize a lot of his new stuff (Coloring Book) as 'rap music' - a lot of it is more like spoken word with gospel backing and he wrote the album for his daughter.  \n\nHaving said that, 10 day and Acid Rap bang boi.

Now, the media focused on the dress code, but just to clarify, Whirlyball is a Chicago establishment where you play a game that's a blend of lacrosse and basketball, in bumper cars...possibly drunk.  Sky High is a trampoline park and he tweeted pictures of them playing trampoline basketball.  I feel like the media missed the real story, which is that Chance does hella fun things and I want to replace my lame friends with him.\n\nEdit: to clarify again, he wasn't turned away from Whirlyball, he left in solidarity for the people who would be.",

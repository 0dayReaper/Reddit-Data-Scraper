They exist mainly in some suburban communities created by a single developer and condominium complexes, ostensibly to protect property values.  Most city neighborhoods and older communities are only regulated by city ordinances, and rural areas have very few controls.  I think a disproportionate number of US redditors come from suburban, upper middle class backgrounds.  I have never lived in a place with a HOA except a couple years in my teens.",

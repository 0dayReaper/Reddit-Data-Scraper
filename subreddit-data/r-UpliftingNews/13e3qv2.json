I just checked and want to say a Big Thank You to all the well wishers who commented.  Briefly, to answer a few questions, I had/have an amazing care team of doctors, nurses, and techs who helped me beat cancer, my wife, kids, and family and friends were invaluable in their support and continue to be.  Finally, I can't describe how it was but I just \"knew\" that it wasn't my time to die back in '07.  To this day I can not put that part into words.  I'll leave you with a little story, At the oncology center the staff calls me \"Miracle Man\", I asked a nurse about it and she said, \"when you walked in here in '07 we all just knew you were a dead man walking and we were going to try to make your last months as comfortable as possible.\"  Thanks again everyone, you're very kind.",

She would qualify for hospice because she will likely aspirate again at some point. I would anticipate she has less than 6 months, but it could be longer or shorter depending on how her swallowing goes.\u201d Just because that person lived 8 months doesn\u2019t mean the doctor was wrong. We are usually trying to estimate it for you. And honestly, we suck at it because statistically people actually live shorter than we estimate. Basically, specifically in cancer patients ~60% of the time we are correct within a month. When we are wrong it\u2019s often shorter. \n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/327/7408/195",

This can lead to incorrect conclusions because of incomplete data. Survivorship bias is a form of selection bias that can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because multiple failures are overlooked, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence as in correlation \"proves\" causality.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Upon return from battle, initially, the most intact plane models were regarded as being the best models, because they looked the least beat up.\n\nIn reality, those were actually the worst models, because only the lightly damaged ones returned at all, while the ones that sustained heavy damage simply never made it back. The more beat up models were therefore able to sustain more damage and still make it back in one piece.\n\nThis is an example of survivorship bias in action.\n\n\nAnother example from WW1:\nWhen helmets were first issued, the amount of soldiers needing medical treatment for head injury massively increased. At first this was alarming and there were calls to stop wearing helmets.\n\nOf course in reality, these soldiers would have simply been dead, not injured, if it wasn't for their helmets.",

The poster you are responding to is making a great and valid point- when we say average life expectancy that is of someone born today, and how we define middle age has to be more nuanced than that-- someone who dies at age 8 surely was not middle aged between 2 and 6 or 3 and 5?? I do also get your point that we have to define it somehow so why not based on life expectancy but bluntly I think anyone would agree that average healthy people are in the prime of their life between around 20 and 40 so especially to call someone in the younger end of that range middle age is flatly illogical I am sorry. I can see it at around 40-45 which neatly coincides with when most women can't have kids any more but not at 25 or 30. Now I am not saying a 30 year old is young but they are an adult in the prime of adulthood-- not middle aged (at least as that term is nearly universally understood), not to me.",

Whenever she saw piles at a clothing donation bin she'd throw them into her van. Bring them home, sort them out, sell what she could, keep what she wanted, and then \"donate\" what was left to \"someone who needed it\", because she was such a motherly soul.\n\nShe very much sees herself as a generous and kind person. I can't tell you how many stories she's told me where she expects me to get outraged on her behalf after someone tries to stop her from doing something shady.\n\nThey were exceedingly nice to *me* because they saw me as part of the family. Anyone outside of that family? No shits given.",

They stole bag valve masks thinking they were respirators instead of, you know, life saving but TEMPORARY equipment for when some can no longer breathe on their own. Fuck those guys! They didn\u2019t steal all of them (there is generally one kept in most patient room for emergencies) but it was still awful. Those do NOTHING to keep pathogens from spreading, but are absolutely necessary to keep patients on life support alive if they need to be transported to another room or even helicoptered somewhere better equipped.",

I knew that her dad was in the film industry and that she was going to try out for commercials at one point. \n\nI remember thinking what a waste it was because she was pretty smart. I thought she should go into a more intellectual field (I was young lol). Then she started blowing up. Eventually she left the school and I kept in touch with her for a bit on facebook back when I had one (secret private account of hers). Then I deleted that and haven't talked to her since. My wife wasn't happy I deleted my FB lol.",

But 90% of the food they distribute is donated by corporate food manufacturers for tax purposes.\n\nUnless you already donate to (or volunteer for) Feeding America, I suggest supporting a local food pantry  where you live in a time of need like this. Corporate philanthropy like large food donations helps society, but it\u2019s not sincere giving. \n\nCelebrities often make donations like this as sincere gestures, but the average person donating $20 to responsible, small charity is just as noble and it might have a bigger impact on their community.",

This is the 2021 version of \"crony capitalism\" as an excuse to avoid confronting the failures of actual capitalism.\n\nThe 2008 collapse wasn't driven by shortsellers but by derivative investors and speculators. The shortsellers saw what was coming first because their business model anticipates bubbles driven by market enthusiasm over actual profitability. I.e., betting against the market didn't tank it, the markets were actually overvalued because they were built on a wild west of math wizardry and bullshit.\n\nPeople got into real estate to sell real estate, people valued and purchased assets that didn't actually exist because it was calculated derived collateral, banks were selling more shares than they had money to keep paying dividends to those shareholders on. The market was so energetic and stocks were rising so fast that everyone just expected to be able to sell their holdings to a third party even more excited than them, and when they finally ran out of people to offload their shit, the market tightened and everyone wanted money back that, one could argue, didn't actually exist.\n\nEDIT:\n\ntl;dr\n\nPeople expected to get rich by buying assets that only held value because they thought someone else wanted those assets. Shortsellers warned people and banks/funds attacked them for dampening the market and poor people for being poor. But if the money isn't there, the money just isn't there, no matter how much billionaires and other capitalists try to bullshit folks.",

This has nothing to do with the many risky, dangerous and unbeneficial products that exist.  Don't mix that up.\n\nThe 2008 collapse was driven by what all crashes are... and over abundance of cheap debt that exceeded what the market could bear.  That lead to the overvaluation of products (in that case primarily around housing) that was so broad the collapse effected every nook and corner of the economy.  Speculators and derivatives were only a part of it... so was unnecessarily low interest.... so was a lack of over sight... so was individuals buying homes they couldn't afford... so was the predatory and negligent lenders... so was the rating agencies... so was the insurers that insured products they shouldn't.....  It was BROAD.  It was no one thing.  That's why it was called a crisis.  \n\nAnd the stock market collapsing was a consequence of the housing crisis.",

Originally, they are targeted to reduce risks by hedging your investment (putting bets on both sides), thus the name. They do this by using short positions or options in a way that makes their funds go opposite of the market (the fund gains when the market goes down, but will lose money when the market goes up). \n\nWhen used the way they're intended to, hedging strategy reduces both the profits and losses of an investment portfolio. Sophisticated investors can use these tools to tune the risks profile of their portfolio, and prevent a complete wipe out of their entire investment portfolio. They don't necessarily make more money for the investor, they just make the returns more stable.\n\nHedge funds can also be used speculatively to anticipate market downfall. When used this way, you only hold the hedges without holding any of the equities the fund is hedging against, but this is a very risky, unorthodox strategy that can generate very huge loses. The maximum risk of regular stock investment is just wiping out your initial capital, but speculation on hedge funds has the potential risk of not only losing that initial capital but also putting you in debt.\n\nProblem is that because hedge funds targets sophisticated investors, they are also less regulated than other types of funds, the assumption being that sophisticated investors are assumed to know and are able to bear the risk of their chosen strategies. Some of the strategies these funds are using can actually cause major shifts in the stock market or the companies they're investing in, while most of these effects are harmless or may be beneficial for market liquidity (which is beneficial for everyone in the market), some strategies such as the ones in GME situation can be quite predatory and can kill the company that they're trading at (which is bad for everyone except the hedge fund).",

We can call that the \"exploitation factor.\"  Fat cats usually attempt to maximize this exploitation factor in order to subsequently maximize their profits.  In their eyes, we are costs to be minimized, while simultaneously being the engines that drive the value they depend upon for their own sustenance.\n\nHedge funds are *even fucking worse.*  They're gambling cabals that try to shear money off of other investors by throwing around enough money to influence share prices and hopefully set off chain reactions.  Sometimes they even get involved in schemes (like Melvin Capital with GME) where they're trying to *make* the company go bankrupt, with sociopathic disregard for what it would do to everyone employed there.  Hedge funds are coke-addled parasites sucking on the lifeblood of society.\n\nThey like to say that the reason that wealthy people deserve to be wealthy is that they take the risk with their capital.  Really?  Like the risk Melvin took when they shorted more stock than actually availably exists (which could cost them *literally* infinite money)?  And now they cry foul?  Fuck you.\n\nAll of this to say that you can't ratchet up a class war over decades--busting unions, dismantling labor rights, divorcing wages from productivity, maximizing exploitation,  increasing wealth inequality, deregulating markets--and then complain when people fire back with your own ammunition.\n\nRight after that quote he says:\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s just a way of attacking wealthy people. It\u2019s inappropriate and we all gotta work together and pull together.\u201d\n\nThe wealthy have class solidarity. They know where their interests lie. Do we?",

Here's just a few of the illegal activities that are on display by the greedy hedge funds while they are railing against WSB for doing something completely legal (buy &amp; hold equities):\n\n1. Naked shorts. They must hold the equities or rights to the underlying equities (call options) that they are shorting within the settlement period (0-3 days usually). \n\n2. By getting away so often with #1 these hedge funds over bought the sell options, resulting in about 140% of the outstanding shares being leveraged by them. \n\n3. They conspired with brokers to not allow buys of the equities by retail investors on Thursday, while the hedge funds could buy. This pushed the stock down illegally since there was no buy demand artificially. \n\n4. Almost all brokers suddenly changed their rules to not allow GME to be margined against (this is legal generally part of the TOS of a brokerage account). This triggered a \"margin call\" on some investors, since they are supposed to maintain a certain percentage of cash vs. Margin on what they own (usually 33-50%). Some brokers went in and liquidated GME holdings of retail investors immediately upon margin call, without asking, even though industry standard is to give 24 hours up to a week to cover a margin call. This is illegal, the broker can't just liquidate parts of your portfolio at will. \n\nAOC did a good job of calling out everything except #4 so far, and since she's on the finance committee there a chance that the hedge funds and brokers that illegally conspired actually face some consequences, But I'm not holding my breath.",

It\u2019s not a sub for getting rich on stocks, it\u2019s a sub for ppl who get a laugh out of \u2018betting\u2019 hard and losing and maybe sometimes winning a lot. \n\nFor GME, so many of them are trying to hold until fund owners go literally bankrupt because they can\u2019t pay these WSB guys the cost of the stocks. So many of them are willing to lose out in the money they \u2018made\u2019 when they only put a couple of bucks in the first place if it fucks with the untouchables.\n\nGo to the sub and read the stories about how some of these ppl had their families ruined in 2008. It\u2019s very personal to many of them, to others it\u2019s just a laugh, and to the really wealthy playing the game it could be a write off.",

Some are coming in to buy more when others are selling to keep prices high, some from Canada and Korea actually to hold the line. \n\nEveryone has to come to their own decisions on what they can do and afford but if there\u2019s a panic sell them the hedge fund guys won\u2019t lose anything and the WSB guys will lose everything. But check out the strategy on their sub. The initial holdout was until this week, next week I think there\u2019s a new regrouping or something. But ultimately there can\u2019t be a panic sale until the shorts expire and the hedges have to claim the lost and must provide the value of the stocks, which could change a lot of lives.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s a complex conversation, so again check out the sub to understand more about them. I\u2019m not a rep of the group or anything. Just someone reading a lot of their stuff this week.",

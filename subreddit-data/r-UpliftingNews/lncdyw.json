Uber drivers cannot just let someone else drive their car if they want to take a day off. This is against Uber's T&amp;C's, and one of the main arguments for the drivers being employees and not contractors. \n\nHowever deliveroo don't give a fuck, you can give your phone to a mate and he can run deliveries while you take a nap if you want. As such they are likely to be ruled contractors and exempt from minimum wage, holiday, etc.\n\nAmazon delivery drivers are more likely to have success to be honest.",

Zero hours workers are entitled to paid leave, and should be calculated based on average pay in weeks where they've worked.

It also has the side effect that in theory if you worked a shitload of hours one week, then remained on the books for the rest of the year but did no work, you'd still be entitled to the 5.6 weeks paid holiday, at the weekly amount you earned in that one week you did work. \n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calculating-holiday-pay-for-workers-without-fixed-hours-or-pay/calculating-holiday-pay-for-workers-without-fixed-hours-or-pay--2\n\nIt's fairer, the principle is people shouldn't lose out for taking holiday as it could disincentivise people from taking leave. Having said that it's a complete nightmare administratively compared to the 12 weeks previously used to calculate holiday pay.",

The bulk of the time consuming work is done, and I actually agree with the principle, I'm just not sure the 52 weeks was entirely necessary.

In exchange there was no paid holidays, but that makes sense, since no one would take holidays during farming anyway, and even if you wanted to, you could just not take the hours offered.",

There's a major difference between being a worker and being a contractor, as Uber drivers were previously, and less of a difference between being a worker and an employee, but there's still a difference.\n\nWe also have zero hour contracts over here which are meant to offer incredible flexibility (although more often financially exploit workers), so it probably won't be too hard for Uber drivers to maintain their flexibility while gaining minimum wage, paid holiday leave (minimum of 28 days), and a few other benefits I can't remember off the top of my head.",

I remember I was babysitting two drunk friends, surge pricing meant uber would've been about the same price as a cab but we were next to a cab rank. So we get the cab and I have to spend the entire ride stopping the driver from taking the most circuitous route possible to run up the meter. It wasn't a situation that was open to argument either, we literally needed to drive 30-40 minutes down one road. But this guy kept trying to turn onto side streets leading away from the destination. And this isn't a one-off thing either, seems to be about 50/50 in my experience. That was the last time I ever got a cab - even if Uber becomes more expensive (which it should), taxi drivers have dug their own grave as far as I'm concerned. I'm happy to pay a premium for convenience, honesty, and efficiency,",

He thought I would be too drunk to notice (after one or two drinks), got the rest of my change and switched to using uber after that. Costs far less to use uber as well and their prices are upfront.

Now a huge chunk is going towards \"advertising\" aka propaganda to make sure drivers don't get rights like these. If another company took over the market share without wasting money on all the extra stuff it's possible they could operate without losing money.\n\nThere is also another company, dumpling I think, that is basically an app for people who operate their own driving business. The app is similar to Uber in that you can call a ride but you're doing so via their own small business.",

Workers don't benefit from all the same rights as employees but this still entails significant change. For example, Uber will now need to ensure that it's workers benefit from the minimum wage and holiday pay. \n\nUber has historically been keen to distance itself from both the worker and employee status which means it has not limited it's drivers from using other driving services. However, now the top court has determined that drivers are workers, it may be the case that Uber limits it's drivers to only drive for Uber (and not Ola, Bolt, etc). The repercussions of this remain to be seen. I doubt Uber will leave the UK. The application of the law here will be likely to be used for other gig economy applications too, eg Deliveroo, TaskRabbit, etc.\n\nSource: am English lawyer.",

They're workers, not employees, which is a subtle distinction in UK law.\n\nAlso, there's nothing about being a worker that means that Uber *must* dictate their hours.\n\nMy bet is that they'll just limit the number of drivers at any given time, changing the limit based on demand. There's already loads of drivers and not enough demand? Try again later. I don't think they'll schedule shifts.",

It's not so much the 'paid holiday' that worries me (I like to think that people are smart enough to factor this in), but more what happens if you get sick (or pregnant).\n\nAlso, I'm interested to know if you think that too many people get 'misled' into being an Uber driver because they don't factor in the costs of running/insuring the car and taking some leave (because they consider it like a 'job' rather than a 'business') - I wonder if the constant carousel of newbies causes excess drivers?",

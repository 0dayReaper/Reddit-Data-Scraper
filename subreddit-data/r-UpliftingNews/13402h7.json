It is about how ionization correlates to temporary changes in the Earth's energy budget.\n\"These observed radiation and cloud changes are consistent with a link in which atmospheric ionization modulates aerosol's formation and growth, which survive to cloud condensation nuclei and ultimately affect cloud formation and thereby temporarily the radiative balance of Earth.\"\nAgain, whatever blog you got that link from is lying to you.\n\nYour other link is a YouTube video, which is irrelevant, the same with Facebook posts, memes, and stuff your third cousin said that one time.\n\nThis is the issue.  People aren't able to parse studies, which is understandable, so instead of listening to a global consensus of experts that specialize in the field they find YouTube videos and Facebook groups full of people that think feelings and facts are the same thing.  They are not.  Believe experts.",

By 2020, its concentration in the atmosphere had risen to 48% above its pre-industrial level (before 1750).\n\nOther greenhouse gases are emitted by human activities in smaller quantities. Methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, but has a shorter atmospheric lifetime. Nitrous oxide, like CO2, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere over decades to centuries. Non-greenhouse gas pollutants, including aerosols like soot, have different warming and cooling effects and are also associated with other issues such as poor air quality.\n\nNatural causes, such as changes in solar radiation or volcanic activity are estimated to have contributed less than plus or minus 0.1\u00b0C to total warming between 1890 and 2010.",

The ones that got put in have become HUGE boons to local communities based on the extra tax revenue going to the towns and local schools. Like each school district was pulling in $500,000+ a year when the wind farms first got installed, and it's only increased. But each neighboring area suddenly became extremely anti windmill. Local teachers suddenly became leaders in the anti windmill organizations who fought to keep new wind farms out. All because tea party far right politicians opposed them. My uncle's one of those teachers. He has actively fought against windfarms for 10+ years, reducing what he would have received in yearly raises and reduced health insurance costs.",

Despite the \"Coal keeps the lights on\" rhetoric, a lot of people say they would rather work on solar panels than in a coal mine.  They also generally mildly support food stamps, medicare, and social security and would rather not have cuts to those for people genuinely need it.  \n\n\nTheoretical scenario: there are two politicians.  One supports all of that, one wants to get rid of all of that and isn't liked.  The first politician who supports all of that is a shoe-in to win, and the whole town likes him.  Two months prior he is asked a mild question about homosexuality and his response is \"Meh, I don't care.\"  Every pastor in the area immediately begins to bash him as a supporter of \"Poisoning the children's minds!\".  His local political career is in shambles, and he is forced to move to another state in order to hope to get elected again.    \nBasically in southeast KY unless you say no comment to public questions and bash gays behind closed doors as a default position, you don't get elected.  Period.  So when someone says \"but the gays\" in response to why people vote for Republicans over democrats, it is literally the explanation.  \n\n\nAlso, that last theoretical was actually a real situation that happened in my hometown a couple of elections ago.  Also look into Matt Bevin.  He was hated, and even still barely managed to get voted out by 1%.  He also pardoned a bunch of prisoners with murder charges.  We have a local guy who cut his wife's head off and even admitted to it, and he was released.",

The term \"republic\" by itself is more of a category of government types where political authority is not exercised by just one person (autocracy) or directly exercised by everyone (direct democracy). That means a republic can be anything from a presidential/parliamentary representative democracy to an oligarchic/aristocratic republic that isn't democratic at all. Since there are no national governments with a pure direct democratic system, the only countries that can be labeled as a \"democracy\" are presidential/parliamentary republics like the U.S. and others or some constitutional monarchies with representative democratic elements that control overall political authority. If a representative democratic constitutional republic can't be considered a democracy, then there basically aren't any in the modern world.",

Sure there can be special overrides for specific use cases, but an override should just cost more. \n\nThere is plenty of time to make the improvements we need; Battery technology is getting better and better; motor efficiency is getting better and better and we are making other efficiency gains from electronic devices; TV's are getting more power efficient, LED's are replacing incondesents.

I live near my parents and so does one of my siblings and we were in a pod together so we saw our parents regularly throughout the pandemic and what was going to happen happened. Sure this is just anecdotal, but given the nature of the disease I don't think it would have played out any differently.",

We finally had to admit him to a memory care unit after my mother just couldn't take care of him anymore.  The staff at the facility say that its pretty normal to watch people delay bringing their loved ones in out of duty/guilt just to end up wearing themselves down in the process.\n\nIts hard to admit that you actually hope your parents pass away soon.  But i'd rather he not be forced to live this way, and that my mother isn't left destitute after paying for his care.",

Sometimes it's outright compulsory if you belong to the church. For example, [catholics in Austria just have to bite the bullet](https://www.thelocal.at/20220328/explained-what-is-austrias-church-tax-and-is-it-mandatory).\n\nAs an aside, this is especially problematic when it involves the Catholic Church (can't speak about other denominations). They consider anyone baptized as a kid to be Catholic. Many, including hardcore atheists, don't realize that, according to the Church, they're still Catholic and owe them taxes. To opt out, you often have to prove your *not* part of the given church. And, of course, leaving the Catholic Church is [infamously difficult](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/07/i-tried-to-quit-the-catholic-church-but-the-catholic-church-wouldnt-quit-me-now-what).",

Yes, I don't think there's something wrong with demanding payment to voluntarily belong to a group.\n\nPersonally, I'm mostly concerned about religious institutions being able to use instruments of state coercion to demand it (for example, in the article I linked, it claims that, in addition to just denying you church services, they can sue for payment). Separation of Church and State and all that. Edit: just the idea of churches being able to use coercion in general doesn't jive with me. Add to this the other problematic issues around church membership (as you say, churches claiming people by default, social preassure to belong to a church, as I said, certain churches intentionally making it difficult to \"officially\" leave them, etc.). And yes, I hadn't thought of that, any government having an official list of people confirmed to be of a certain faith is not what I would call comfortable.\n\nBut yes, it would be another thing entirely if churches were just like \"give tithe or you can't assist mass.\" I would still call it greedy and abusive under certain circumstances (e. g., people are convinced they have to pay or go to Hell). But outside of those, it would be no different than paying a fee to belong to a club.",

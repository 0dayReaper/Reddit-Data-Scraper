It's great it's helping these verysocial animals. Parrots should be in large flocks, it's got to be emotionally difficult to be alone in a small cage.\n\nSmithsonian news article [*Scientists Taught Pet Parrots to Video Call Each Other\u2014and the Birds Loved It*.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-taught-pet-parrots-to-video-call-each-other-and-the-birds-loved-it-180982041/)\n\nJournal article [*Birds of a Feather Video-Flock Together: Design and Evaluation of an Agency-Based Parrot-to-Parrot Video-Calling System for Interspecies Ethical Enrichment*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581166).\n\n**Abstract:**\n\n&gt;Over 20 million parrots are kept as pets in the US, often lacking appropriate stimuli to meet their high social, cognitive, and emotional needs. After reviewing bird perception and agency literature, we developed an approach to allow parrots to engage in video-calling other parrots. Following a pilot experiment and expert survey, we ran a three-month study with 18 pet birds to evaluate the potential value and usability of a parrot-parrot video-calling system. We assessed the system in terms of perception, agency, engagement, and overall perceived benefits. With 147 bird-triggered calls, our results show that 1) every bird used the system, 2) most birds exhibited high motivation and intentionality, and 3) all caretakers reported perceived benefits, some arguably life-transformative, such as learning to forage or even to fly by watching others. We report on individual insights and propose considerations regarding ethics and the potential of parrot video-calling for enrichment.",

Human brains are more geared towards higher critical thinking, like math, than other animals - that, combined with the human ability to easily manipulate our environment, makes us smarter than dogs. However, dogs are still aware of their environment, have personalities, hold opinions on the quality of things (think preferred toys), and can remember things. \n\nIt may be that consciousness is present in more complex forms than previously thought in various creatures with centralized nervous systems like brains. The only variation might be in the brain structure, which allows for more complex additions like tool use, advanced problem-solving, and critical thinking. It's obvious that humans would be better in these categories compared to almost every other species because we have more brain-to-body ratio dedicated to these energy-intensive sectors of the brain.",

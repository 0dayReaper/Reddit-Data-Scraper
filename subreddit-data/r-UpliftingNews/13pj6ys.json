It's sad to see that women are refused certain rights because of a bigoted minority and a silent majority.",

So much of peer pressure that doesn\u2019t actually exist, people just think it does.\n\nAs an example, my wife thought i wouldn\u2019t support her going back to school to become a psychologist. She had been thinking about it for a while. I can\u2019t remember how it came up, but I asked her why she didn\u2019t say anything sooner. Turns out she was just very anxious. Now she\u2019s second year and doing amazingly well, and I\u2019ve been helping and supporting her each way.\n\nSometimes we are our own worst enemy with those kinds of things. We think everyone around us won\u2019t allow it, or will hate us for it, but often that\u2019s not the case.",

A lot of people aren't super invested in the well being of strangers, so they hold others to higher standards but seldom wish to put in the effort and resources to meet those standards themselves without a first having strong personal emotional investment up front.\n\nThe GOP has been chomping at the bit to run over people for a while, but I think a lot of why they can now with so little actual visible blowback is because we're more divided than ever, and so many, particularly lonely men just aren't personally affected by the fight for women's rights.",

We like to boil that down to a patriarchal stance, call it immoral and invalid, and move on. \n\nUltimately though you can tell that it's more that it's convenient to be *able* to dismiss them for being a man, because we would also like to dismiss the anti choice fundamentalist women who we believe are voting against their best interests (and overwhelmingly do have abortions on a case by case basis, justifying it internally), yet we can't do so.",

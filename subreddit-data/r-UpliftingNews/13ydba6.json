They cost $44-$70/kWh, are good for 4500 full cycles (much more partial cycles) and there are no materials constraints. The main ingredient is salt. And they work st peak efficiency from -20C to +60C but are still ok to work at -60C. A small amount of insulation and a tiny bit of heat is all you need for the coldest winter.

That can be rooftop solar, wind, water, or if we wanted to be serious about things, nuclear.  Unfortunately Jane Fonda, Michael Douglass, and a bunch of stupid alarmist people around the world really fucked us on that last one, and thus have just outright fucked us as a society, but sure, go ahead and spread more ignorance.\n\n&gt; If the energy is used to create a stable fuel, that energy can be transported anywhere in the world.\n\nYou seem to not realize you have to expend energy to transport that fuel, and thus you have: energy loss.  You gonna ship it by truck or train?  Gonna need some fuel or electrical energy to move that.  Wanna pump it... turns out pumps require energy to move things.  Not to mention that if you are doing something like converting to hydrogen and back, you have additional conversion losses on top of transport losses.  Really you're just digging a deeper hole.\n\n&gt; You can use electrical lines to transport energy hundreds of miles. \n\nSure, and the longer the lines are, the more energy loss.

However, the cost for physical fuel is negligible. The cost for transmission over long distances is more via lines is more so a loss. However, even at a hypothetical 25% loss it is still worth it due to the continued falling cost of solar. Of course that would be 25% greater loss than what we already experience. \n\nIgnorance of ecology. Like I said, I love this ecology stuff. I simplified it down to least environmental impact. Of course that is the desert. But okay. \n\nFor energy you need economies of scale for a number of reasons. Small independent energy sources reduce demand in the grid, but unless they are permanently off the grid it still is a burden and has costs to the grid. Additionally, mounting panels and roofs and in cities is more expensive to install and maintain than a large solar field with tracking panels. \n\nCall me environmentally ignorant all you want. I know loads more about energy generation and transmission than you. I am also not naive about the fact that some environmental damage is okay. \n\nWhere do you sleep every night? Someplace in the environment that was destroyed for your home. A home built from materials that were gathered by harming the environment. \n\nKeep fighting for the desert and shoot society in its foot. Btw, I do know the desert has some environmental importance. It just has LESS than an area covered in trees. As long as we space out power plants and leave a majority of the desert untouched, we should be fine. Or we can cut down trees and plant them there. We have options. We have land. Glad it is happening. Btw - in places with no desert, we do just cut down hundreds of acres of trees to install solar. It's being done now, I saw it happen along the highway over a year. \n\nElectricity is already transferred incredibly long distances by the way.

Basically certain things (like landfills and composting) naturally give off methane (natural gas), which itself is a much worse greenhouse gas than CO2 or water, which are the byproducts of burning natural. As a result, it can end up being carbon negative to collect natural gas from landfills, composting, etc. and burning it for fuel. And that\u2019s without considering the possibility of carbon sequestration. \n\nCould you see that being a viable long term source of natural gas? I\u2019m still learning about it, but it sounds interesting and promising to me.",

My shop is 3400 sq ft and switching out from the natural gas mini-boiler to a pair of mini-split heat pumps slashed my heating bill in half even after I had it warmer inside all winter. And it\u2019s also sweet air conditioning. \n\nHave you tried an indiction stove yet? I have a fancy Italian gas range. I bought a countertop induction \u2018hot plate\u2019 to run off of the solar power in my Rv bus and holy shit that thing can boil water faster than my flame thrower of a gas range. It just plain works better and it wasn\u2019t even that expensive.\n\nHeat pump based hot water heaters are a thing too.\n\nIf I was building new right now I would delete the gas service and put the money I saved into green tech instead. \n\nRemember when all the car engines had carbs? People screamed bloody murder about fuel injection. More expensive! Hot rodding is dead! But oh that mileage is nice and it always runs good. Same with green tech. Or even electric cars. A bit more money up front but the cost savings are so drastic that you pay far less in the long run.",

Point that downturn out just 10 years. \n\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/wind-and-solar-were-eus-top-electricity-source-in-2022-for-first-time-ever/\n\nWind and Solar were the top sources of power in 2022 in the EU. Pay particular attention to the top graph. Take any of those lines and project them out 10 years.\n\nSure we will still he producing burning a small amount of oil in a decade, but it will be less than 10% of what we burn now. You simply can\u2019t compete with green energy on price. Right now if you take out a 6 year loan for solar + battery it cost less than simply dumping fuel into an existing power plant. And that ignores ongoing maintenance costs for the fossil fuel plant. The solar system just needs a window washer for half a century and a battery swap every 20 years.",

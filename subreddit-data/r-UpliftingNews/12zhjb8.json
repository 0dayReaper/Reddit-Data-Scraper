I live in one of the smaller metros, doing my work to make this state a better place. I have lost power 1 time in the last year. And it was a localized outage. Someone ran into a power pole. Yes, Austin had outages in the ice storm this year. That was a city ran municipal provider \"Last Mile\" issue. It's no one's fault but Austin for that. Dallas, who got hit just as bad, had almost no customers without power.",

It wasn't always like that either, it just changed a couple of years ago so this isn't me just walking into a place for the first time and making a bunch of rash judgements. This used to be my go-to place but I moved away so it was no longer 'the bar down the street' for me but my partner and I have made a few visits the past couple months for nostalgia and it's a noticeably different vibe. Sorry if I came off like I'm calling it a racist/Nazi bar or w/e, I'm not trying to do all that. I just wanted to point out that we have long-standing, established businesses out here making RECENT changes to narrow the range of clientele that walks through their door in a very specific way and it's not a particularly rare thing, even close to the city. Even the bar down the street from me, IN KANSAS CITY, had a \"no sagging/loose fitting clothes\" sign on the front door until the owner died last year, too. It's pretty weird for a dive bar (or any bar/restaraunt in this area tbh) to have a dress code at all, but that one seemed pretty specific. And dated.",

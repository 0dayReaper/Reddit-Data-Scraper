Long background story short, he was supposed to be there but he was on crutches at the time and that was all she noticed, so she didn't realize it was him. \n\nWatching her stop and berate Bill Murray for trying to enter while the rest of us watched in horror is one of my most treasured memories. In part because he just stood there with an expression like, \"I'm fucking Bill Murray. No one ever stops me.\" We  did try to stop her tirade before she embarrassed herself further, but she was just so confidently wrong. It was a priceless moment.",

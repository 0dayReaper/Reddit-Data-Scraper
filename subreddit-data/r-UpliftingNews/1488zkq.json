                    "comment": "They will not be legally persecuted because:\n\na) being LGBTQ+ is not technically illegal in Sri Lanka. What is illegal is \"unnatural sexual acts\" which doesn't really have a definition and can be used to persecute people, but would require proof that people at this rally engaged in such. This is a left over from the early 1900s penal code that was never updated because \"reasons\". However, there is also  a bill in parliment right now to specifically decriminalize homosexuality, to close off that loophole as well.\n\nb) LGBTQ+, have been gaining steady acceptance in the recent decade and a half, with strong sub-communities of LGB &amp; T for sure, and probably Q+ as well even though I haven not met them. The resistance mostly comes from the religious types and extremists, and your regular citizen doesn't really care if someone is gay or trans, specially in and around the capital of Colombo. However, this does not stop the bigots, extremists, and opportunists from trying.\n\nIt has been really refreshing to see the LGBTQ+ community gaining acceptance and even thriving in at least the capital and suburbs, with our pride parades and events gaining more and more popularity and attracting not only the LGBTQ+ but cis/het allies as well. I've always been a part of the more liberal communities so always had LGBTQ+ friends, so let me just say that yes, this work that's being done is absolutely necessary and trailblazing.\n\nI still remember back in 2016 when my company did marketing for a movie which had a trans character (played by a really buff actor that in the plot was possessed by the ghost of a murdered woman so he went all woman in there) and the trans community came out in force, and it was just good vibes between everyone.\n\nThis is not to say that LGBTQ+ communities don't face some unique social challenges, but they are not persecuted by the state, at the very least. We just really question that uncle that's lived together with his \"best friend\" for 20 years or so. Do we have a long long way to go, with a lot of work that needs to be done? Absolutely. Is someone gonna get their head chopped off or thrown in jail or have their job prospects reduced? No. Will they face some harassment from bigots? sadly yes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we're in the middle of an economic recession caused by corruption, with ongoing religious and ethnic conflict that's basically being inflamed by different political parties for political gain, with a hint of extremism thrown in for good measure, but at least the LGBTQ+ fight is being fought on level ground instead of being a constant uphill struggle.\n\nAgain, this changes when we move out of the capital and big cities into more rural areas, but there seems to be a more of a \"don't ask don't tell\" policy in those areas as opposed to straight up oppression that you see in some other countries.\n\nIt keeps getting better as the \"boomers\" (not sure if this phrase can be applied in Sri Lanka, but you get what I mean) get pushed out/die off and younger generations gain more economic and political power.\n\nSource: I'm Sri Lankan.",

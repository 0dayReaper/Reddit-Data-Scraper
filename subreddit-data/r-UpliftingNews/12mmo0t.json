What was once a ship named after a Confederate-related event is now a complete 180\u00b0 of what it was. Whether or not shes got much time left doesnt matter as long as she bears a name worthy of respect in those final years.",

When soy exports crashed during Trump's trade war against China countless farmers in middle America lost homes and farms that had been in their families for generations.\n\nYou can say our navy is a waste of money all you like, but it really isn't.

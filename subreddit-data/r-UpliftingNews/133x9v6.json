When you go to soup kitchens they are usually run by churches who want you to convert to their religion, too. There was always this teeming animosity just beneath the surface, where they had expectations of you when all you wanted and needed was food because you're poor or hungry. Many times I went hungry simply because I didn't want to have to prove myself as it was exhausting. Sometimes people take advantage of the free food thing when they don't need it themselves and that's frustrating. But overall I think its a great idea..if you're gonna do charity work..not to ask questions why. People need food, period. Or we don't survive.   \n\n\nReally lovely of this place, and if I happen to be in the area again I'll be sure to buy some food from them",

I have celiac disease and allergies and I remember how angry they got when I wouldn't eat things that would kill me and risked not eating for longer over that because \"God provides.\" \"And yet I don't think going into anaphylaxis when I know this will kill me is a good idea.\" Here the few shelters that take women without children are also run by churches. There's one that isn't and it's full. Guess which shelters have the highest rape rates? Guess who gets punished for that? I eventually started stealing cutlery at dinner if I could eat any of it and stabbed the people who were trying shit. Didn't protect anyone else but we signed an NDA to stay there. I do wonder if that NDA would hold up since you're under duress signing it but I don't know",

It was horrifying and I fled back to the street.  \n\n\nIm just so angry to read this...what you've gone through. I'm so angry you had to go through any of that!! Are you in a safer situation today?

That wasn't my only time being homeless but it's been over a decade and I have assistance for that now. I was homeless to survive except the time I was homeless because of medical malpractice. They sort of merged in my memory because it was the same sort of bad. I am lucky enough to know I will never be homeless again. \n\nI survived the streets because of others helping me without actually wanting something for it. The time I was shot because leaving abuse is the most dangerous time and woke up a year later in one of the camps? Absolutely terrifying but somehow I wasn't dead and with my allergies alone that is impressive. The time I gave up and went to eat with friends as a last meal and left with reasons to keep fighting for basic needs? All of those things keep me going now too \n\nI spend a lot of my time pressuring the people in power to change the rules. Religious shelters should not be exempt from regulations and should not be allowed to force an NDA. Soup kitchens need to actually offer more than endless pasta. People need more nutrients than that. News cameras need to be kept out of shelters on holidays both so you're not forced to act like the shelter isn't hell and because they love filming the children and airing the children in shelters on the holidays. The worst days of people's lives so those with tv and shelter feel good it's not them? Fuck that noise. \n\nSome progress has been made and I definitely had some revenge on the hospital and doctor that ruined my spine. I sued and the offers given were very bad except the one where until I die? They have to give the low income in the area free medical care. All levels not just emergency. Homeless with cancer? They have to get you treatment anyway. They offered this because I wasn't supposed to live for long. I gambled on myself living. It's close to 20 years. I should be dead = my medical state at all times but I survived to adulthood without doctors. With doctors I might actually get old. \n\nSo things are good and I spend my time wisely making sure the people who exploit the homeless for financial gain know they're not going to get away with that forever. It's a system where they undermine your success so they can profit off the cycle of homelessness for people. I have a vengeful side and a law degree I did not have for the first round of homelessness, so I'm hoping to destroy them. At minimum I want to make sure everyone knows how holy they are.",

It's not just personal choice but the professional panhandlers don't tend to accept them. They want cash and only cash. I don't know of any actually homeless pan handlers as when homeless you are too busy surviving and trying to get shelter to sit and beg for added irony. We did have people who came into the spaces we had claimed and did just what you suggest and that was part of what kept me going. Sometimes others would bring me food because they got lucky and someone was generous so they saved me what they knew I could eat. Homelessness in my experience was a team effort",

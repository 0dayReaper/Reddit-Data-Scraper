We are lazy creatures, so we leave info out because we'd prefer the reader to just work it out.\n\nEdit:For fun I tried to get the AI to reply to your comment to sound more human using the points you'd raised. Even after the initial prompt and 5 further prompts to try and fine tune it's response, it doesn't sound natural at all:\n\n&gt;Hey! Thanks for sharing your thoughts about using AI to reply to comments on Reddit. I totally agree that even with the extra context, the responses from the bot can sound a bit forced and not quite human-like. It seems like they're trying too hard to sound like us, but they're not quite there yet, you know what I mean?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In my opinion, the main issue with AI is that it still has a long way to go in terms of truly understanding human language and context. While it can identify certain words and phrases, it's not the same as having a real conversation with a real person. It's like AI is still trying to learn how to communicate in a way that feels natural to humans.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyway, I appreciate your perspective on this. It's always interesting to hear different opinions and ideas about topics like this. Do you have any thoughts on how AI could improve its ability to communicate with humans in a more natural way?",

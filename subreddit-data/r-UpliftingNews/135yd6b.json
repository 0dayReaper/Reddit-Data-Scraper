Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. **Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith.**\n\nThere's a bunch of things the founding fathers spelled out very very **clearly** AND put their names on, that nobody seemingly gives a shit about anymore.",

That's where the right wing evangelicals would have us go back to if they ever get their way.",

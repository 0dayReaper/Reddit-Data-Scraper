I and I alone would be thanked for the contributions, and anything I had to say wasn\u2019t challenged while if it came out of her mouth it would be fought against tooth and nail if it disagreed with the answer the group leader had come up with. Eventually she left the group for another one after making a complaint about it to the lecturer and I absolutely couldn\u2019t blame her for it.

A graduate student (Raymond Gosling) working under Franklin and Maurice Wilkins is the one who took the infamous picture in Watson and Cricks paper. (Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51 + https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Gosling)\n1b. Neither Franklin nor Gosling were even the first to obtain images of DNA's crystal structure, previous attempts just did not have a high enough resolution to determine the three dimensional structure (On mobile so can't find source)\n\n2. She is acknowledged in the paper (source: https://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/coldspring/printit.html or pay walled link to actual journal paper https://www.nature.com/articles/171737a0)\n\n3. She worked under Wilkins who funded the research and is the one who \"owns\" the data and he gets to decide how it is shared with the world. (Source: I am a graduate student lol)\n\n4. She publicly showed \"her\" data to Watson and Crick (and I believe a few other scientists working on solving the structure of DNA) months earlier. Quotes explained below (on mobile so can't find source)\n4b. DNA has 3 conformoations (basically ways it arranges 3 dimensionally), Franklin was most interested in the so called A conformation (she thought biological DNA arranged in A conformation) and did care as much about B conformation (the actual conformation of biological DNA). This is part of the reason she publicly shared some of the images of the B conformation. Watson and Crick supposedly instantly knew that B was the correct conformation and the actual arrangement (deoxysugar backbone and nitrogenous bases in the middle) (source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-DNA and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_double_helix#Helix_geometries)\n4c. Franklin hypothesized DNA had a triple* helix (Not entirely sure on this one, remembering from 5+ years ago but I know she did NOT think it was a double helix...again on mobile so can't find source)\n\n5. For those who think Franklin was robbed of the Nobel prize. The Nobel committee does not award Nobel prizes posthumously and she died 4 years before Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded it (source: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/nobel-prize-facts/ and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin)\n\nTLDR: A graduate student (NOT Franklin) took the picture in Watson and Crick's paper. Franklin is acknowledged in the paper. Her boss \"owned\" the data and gave Watson and crick permission to use it. Franklin had already shown them the picture beforehand anyway.\n\nFranklin (and Gosling) were by all accounts excellent crystallographers (and I say this as someone that did protein crystallography in undergrad) but Watson and Crick were the ones who determined the three dimensional structure of DNA. \n\nBonus fun fact: The published structures of 2 (?, again remembering from 5+ years ago) Of the nitrogenous bases were incorrect and would not properly base pair (adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine). The nitrogenous bases have multiple isomers (molecules with the same chemical formula/composition that arrange in slightly different ways), the person who identified the structure did not know which one occurred in biological DNA and basically guessed (wrong). Watson and Crick happened to work down the hall (or a nearby building or something) from this person and asked him about it, and he admitted he guessed lol.",

This phenomenon was first described by suffragist and abolitionist Matilda Joslyn Gage (1826\u201398) in her essay, \"Woman as Inventor\" (first published as a tract in 1870 and in the North American Review in 1883). The term \"Matilda effect\" was coined in 1993 by science historian Margaret W. Rossiter. Rossiter provides several examples of this effect.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

The gender shouldn't matter. \n\nExcept the gender does matter. The race does matter. *Especially* in academic jobs where you are interfacing with students and young professionals who feel more comfortable and empowered with advisors with a similar backround to themselves. Additionally, women in academia encounter a number of challenges and differences in achieving success relative to men. They cite themselves less frequently than men, and their scientific writing is critiqued more harshly than men's. Let alone the harassment that young female academics can face from senior male academics that causes some women to leave academia. And then the place that most institutions are at right now is one that is very male and very white. It takes a very specific kind of woman who is both equally regarded in her field to men (despite the disparity in support and systemic issues), *and* is also willing to enter that kind of workplace and be a pioneer. A big issue that institutions face is qualified women (particularly women of color) don't even bother applying to certain positions because they worry that they will end up in a hostile workplace. Specifically marketing these openings towards this group is a form of affirmative action, but one I think is very important.",

This is just the tip of the iceberg as well, she did much more, check out her Wikipedia page. \n\nShe basically discovered the LARGEST landmark on the planet and still no-one knows her name. \n\nAmazing scientist.",

Because this particular band doesn't belong to a label. Literally the only reason. Several studio albums, plenty of revenue, plenty of fame and acclaim, unique name (so no confusion) - but being an independent band means you're too small, according to some POS corporate shill of an editor.",

If I don't know a gay person like xyz, there must not be any. If I've never heard of an Arab that accomplished this thing, they must never have.\"\n\nTo the victor, and all that, and why with our broadened understanding of humanity and human nature in the past 100 years we'd do well to put aside 19th and 18th century ideals about the world and move forward respecting human life.",

It\u2019s not like COVID in that COVID is a novel coronavirus, which means it hadn\u2019t been seen before. Maybe in a few years of mutation they will be alike. Anyway, this approval is only for old people, which RSV tends to send to the hospital, of which 8% die. Not great odds. What\u2019s special is that companies have been trying to develop an RSV vaccine for decades, and this is the first one. There\u2019s a maternal one in trials to protect babies as well. Personally, one of my kids spent time in the pediatric ICU for RSV, and it was really scary, as he had a good chance of dying (thus the ICU).",

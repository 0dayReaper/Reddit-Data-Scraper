            "comment": "\"Now there is enough electricity, and it is almost emission-free. So you can feel good about using electricity,\" Ruusunen pointed out\u2026\n\n\"We have a very good chance of building on this with industrial investments for the green transition. Finland is truly competitive; emissions are close to zero and everything is working fine. The prospects look great,\" he said.\u201d\n\nThis is good news, particularly in light of our changing climate. Clean energy might allow more people to use climate controlled spaces to reduce the impact of our warming planet.",

I truly believe all the anti socialism rhetoric would go away if we adopted the everyone-benefits models \u2026in other words , for example free lunch program  , I wouldn\u2019t mind free lunch program if my tax money was paying free lunch for my kid too and not just the inner city kid for example",

With so much less waste, fraud, abuse, and administrative overhead, how is your half-stupid cousin supposed to get rich?\n\nBut seriously, of course it should be this way. Every dollar spent deciding who is eligible for food stamps is completely useless, when there is virtually no one who doesn't spend at least the benefit amount on food. Just give it to everyone, and save the overhead. Bonus you eliminate the stigma. School lunch is that same logic but to the eleventh power.",

They earn the most money, and proportionally spend the least amount of money. They recirculate the least amount of money of any group, whereas the poor recirculate basically 100%.   \nThe ultra-rich just put that money on some off shore bank account, where it's effectively just removed from the economy. \n\nTaxing the ultra-rich, then giving that money to the poor who will recirculate 100% of that money is much fucking better than letting them hoard it. In the long term, it's better for the rich themselves too.",

What exactly are you comparing with? If we take 2 examples, USA and Sweden, where Sweden has a much stronger state with a higher level of taxes and redistribution from the rich to the poor, then of course the rich benefits more from being in USA, with the weaker state with less taxes. Based on these 2 examples then the rich absolutely do not benefit the most \"from the state\". Like what are you comparing against to come to that conclusion?",

Finland's income tax is progressive from 8.6% to 56%. \nAlso, I think Americans especially have very hard time to grasp socialist programs for the people and market liberalism. Nordics have always been on the top, if not the top on market liberalism in Europpe. Those nations thrive on free competitive markets, not on their own small intra markets. While many countries had gas and energy subsidies due to the Russian energy crisis last year, Finland did not. In EU only Denmark has used less to subsidies than Finland when adjusted to GDP to tackle the energy crisis. https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/national-policies-shield-consumers-rising-energy-prices\n\nFinland has big share of its energy from nuclear and just had Western worlds first 3rd gen reactor go online. Plus huge amount of hydro and more space to build wind turbines than anywhere else in Western Europe. In 2022 Finland increased its wind capacity for 75% compared to 2021 and similar trend is going on in 2023. If all the investment plans for the next 2 years for wind power get green lighted that would increase the capacity for 450 TWh. Finland and Sweden have been major winners in the green energy transition. Why some of the multi billion euro hydrogen facilities and 4 billion euro green steel plants are rising up in those regions.",

Well, it takes a lot of time, a lot of people, and a lot of wasted resources to turn on and turn off huge machines like a power plant or a factory. The barrier-to-entry and exit is high.\n\nSo there exists a small window of (effectively) time where it's actually cheaper to pay people to take your product off of your hands than to deal with the cost of damage caused by congestion or the cost of shutting down+turning on.",

The market for power is set up to incentivize production when demand is high and incentivize curtailing production when demand is low. \n\nOur electric companies charge consumers a set price, for example 10\u00a2/kWh. The price our electric companies pay power plants varies and is set by the state. Until recently, the most they could change is $9/kWh which happened as our grid collapsed in February 2021. There is no floor, but I've seen as low as -3\u00a2/kWh. If the price goes negative, plants will shut down because they have to pay the power companies to take excess generation. The payment stays in pocket with the electric company.\n\nBecause their pricing model to consumers is a flat rate, they take a risk that wholesale electricity will have highs and lows. They try to price as low as possible to still make a profit. That includes studies on swings negative as well as price peaks.",

It would be incorrect to use the average price of electricity to calculate their RoI though, because unlike a nuclear power plant they don't produce constantly. In fact if we look at electricity prices in the Nordic countries last year we can already see the electricity price heavily fluctuate based on how much the wind is blowing. With enough wind already installed installing more becomes less and less economical, which at some point makes nuclear the better economic option. But it's kinda silly to debate wind vs nuclear, we need both, and both are good investments, they're not mutually exclusive, quite the opposite actually.",

To assume that the average price will rise and stay at the highest they have ever been for 7 years is farcical. \n\nNobody is assuming that, you're strawmanning me. You used the electricity prices today to say that nuclear wasn't profitable. I used the average prices of all of last year to show the opposite. Obviously neither of these represents the future and we'll probably fall somewhere in-between. \n\n&gt; Yeah, but if you do the ROI calculation wind and solar win out even more.\n\nLike I said, build enough wind and the ROI calculation starts to look pretty bad for it. At some point nuclear will beat it. \n\n&gt; That's why 95% off all new energy generation worldwide is wind and solar. \n\nNot really, the biggest reason is that the risk is just so much lower with wind and solar due to the lower up-front cost, the lower construction time, and the less unstable political climate around it.\n\n&gt; Nuclear is in fact such a bad investment, that no one actually invests in it unless a state is guaranteeing the profits. \n\nJust plain false. I don't even think this is true for the very nuclear reactor we're talking about here, Olkiluoto 3.\n\n&gt; It is always better to keep nuclear online while fossil fuels are part of the mix. but when it comes to new generation it gives you the least bang for your buck, and with massive time delays. \n\nQuite the opposite actually, it's solar and wind that needs fossil fuels to stick around to handle the dips.\n\n&gt; The negative prices in Finland are examples of how badly renewables and nuclear work, as Nuclear mainly has fixed costs, yet needs to regulate down or pay others to take the energy whenever renewables produce. This makes the economics of nuclear even less tenable.\n\nThe reason you get negative costs is because you have a period of high generation from variable sources without also high demand. If you replace nuclear with even more variable generation this would get even worse. Mixing in nuclear acts as stabilizing factor, reducing cost during peaks, and increasing cost during dips, compared to just having more variable generation. And the economics of nuclear isn't really affected by this, nuclear will get whatever profit it needs during the peaks where the variable sources can't keep up. The more variable generation you the higher prices will be during peaks where nuclear will make up for the lost profit during the dips.",

Additionally meltdowns only result in catastrophic failures on old bad reactor designs, you don't really need to worry about meltdowns if you build new modern nuclear. Also Singapore is a small city-state with no land really, they get 95% of their electricity burning Natural Gas.

There will eventually come a time where prices slip into the negative due to the overprovisioning of wind and solar. That can be used to power a lot of energy intensive and not time sensitive industrial, infrastructural and climate activities. Including but not exhaustive water-desalination, drainage, filling pumped hydro reservoirs, heating seasonal heat-energy stores, electrolyzing hydrogen, hydrogen to ammonia conversion, carbon sequestration, etc. It pays for itself by creating space for these otherwise very expensive processes to have times where they can affordably operate that have larger indirect benefits.",

Bullshit thing was last winter when there was \"lack\" of electricity and electricity companies sold 2 year contracts from 30\u00a2/kW-hr up to 50\u00a2/kW-hr. \nThese prices are unheard of in Finland, we used to have 5\u00a2/kW-hr prices until start of Ukraine war. Ukraine war is make up reason for price gouging in Finland. \n\nOur Bensine is one of most expensive in world, because of green movement. It's +2\u20ac/litre. \n\n\nNow that winter has gone market price is negative but people are stuck with these bullshit prices.",

How do you think it'll play out locally and internationally when they ask them to bury their nuclear waste in countries known for high ecological diversity but also for skirting rules due to corruption? Mismanagement is pretty much a byword for Southeast Asian governments. It's an even worse look when you consider that these countries have to figure out their own decarbonisation plans while apparently helping Singapore achieve theirs by storing radioactive waste, with all the associated cost and safety burdens. That doesn't make for pretty headlines and happy voters. \n\nAs for the solar solution, it says a lot that there's already a project in the works with support for the governments on both ends, and some serious VC capital backing it up. They've even started laying down panels and have just finished the seafloor survey for the cable. That's some solid forward movement compared to nuclear, which has been considered but hasn't gone past the theoretical phase. In fact, it just came out on the news today that the project is moving forward: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-26/sun-cable-mike-cannon-bookes-andrew-forrest-decision/102396072",

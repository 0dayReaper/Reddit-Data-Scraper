            "comment": "DC Pride this year was my first. Didn't make it to the festival but I think I got exactly what I needed. There was this older woman in a blue shirt giving out mom hugs and up until the point that I was crying into her shoulder I had felt this irrational feel of people and a great social anxiety and it all just... went away. I never got that kind of love and acceptance from my parents, and it was the closure I needed from the loving arms of a stranger. This sweet woman changed something within me, all in the span of a few minutes. I'm incredibly grateful for people like her giving people like me that kind of compassion. I think I'll be going back next year",

Then we turned the corner and saw an entire city block celebrating, laughing, and dancing. And then that was repeated block by block. More and more people showed up as time went on.

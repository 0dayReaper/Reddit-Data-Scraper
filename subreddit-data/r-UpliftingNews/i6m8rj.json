            "comment": "&gt; David Jaros, a law professor at the University of Baltimore, said the ruling is more \u201cevidence that a mere citation-level of marijuana cannot be leveraged into probable cause to search ... and serves notice on police and state\u2019s attorneys.\u201d\n\n-from the article \n\nSo, if my understanding is correct, the reason why the odor of marijuana cannot be used as probable cause to search a vehicle in Maryland is because the State decriminalized marijuana under a certain amount. There's no way for an officer to determine whether or not the odor is caused by a legal or illegal amount of marijuana. Searching a vehicle and finding a legal amount of marijuana would therefore result in an illegal search. Yeah?",

The court ruled that an officer can not perform an arrest, and search incident to an arrest based on the smell of marijuana.  A search incident to an arrest is a detailed search of a person to inventory everything they have before taking them to jail.  The article clearly states that the court still allows for the search of the vehicle based on smell alone.  The officer of course can still do a brief pat down of the person to make sure they don't have weapons on them, and still find weed in your pocket while doing so.  They just can't do the more intrusive search incident to arrest.  This isn't  surprise because the mere smell of marijuana should never have led to an arrest, only the actual presence of marijuana.",

If you are arrested, the police will always search your person.  You may be mixing the search part up with the inventory search, which is often a tactic to go through someone's vehicle to \"inventory\" the contents upon it's seizure.\n\nEdit:. Read the actual decision -  it is worded a little oddly... In the case in question, an individual was detained (placed in handcuffs) and searched based on smelling like weed.  He was found to have a gun and was arrested.  If he didn't have anything, he wouldn't have gotten locked up.  The court is saying that original stop was no good.",

Without police unions, if a cop is harassing someone who has already won a lawsuit against the police, said cop is a liability.  They could cost the city more money, the mayor an election, ect.\n\nI mean could you imagine in the private sector you're a mid or entry level employee, and you know that a customer won a lawsuit against your company for a million dollars.  Then that customer comes back into the store and you try to pick a fight with them.  You'd be fired within the hour.  People that have already won litigation are like financial landmines to managers, I can't imagine police chiefs and mayors think differently.  Its just this thin blue line crap and police unions.",

My grandparents moved to Toronto in February of 1966 so when their kids were born in July all their paperwork said white. My Father never experienced direct racism, but would call out what he heard that made hin uncomfortable. \n\nIn 1999 my father was posted in a rural community that previously had a residential school. In fact, my mother's grandmother had gone there as a \"destitute child\" (I won't really get into that but its a catalyst). Through the course of event's my father also ended up running the local ambulance service on a fulltime basis and dropped back to casual with the RCMP. Around that time he connected with a man living on the settlement. He saw my dad and said, \"You don't know me, but I served with your grandfather Jack in the war.\" My dad was floored, mostly because he had no idea who his grandfather was, his parents wouldn't tell him (Spoiler alert, he was right). So we moved to the settlement to connect with our culture. \n\nMy father experienced the RCMP from both sides and said to me, \"If you are ever accused of mistreating someone connected to law enforcement, call a lawyer to the scene.",

Vitale ](https://www.amazon.com/End-Policing-Alex-S-Vitale/dp/1784782920)\n&gt;\tThe problem is not overpolicing, it is policing itself. Why we need to defund the police and how we get there.\n\n&gt;Recent weeks have seen an explosion of protest against police brutality and repression. Among activists, journalists and politicians, the conversation about how to respond and improve policing has focused on accountability, diversity, training, and community relations. Unfortunately, these reforms will not produce results, either alone or in combination. The core of the problem must be addressed: the nature of modern policing itself.\n\n&gt;This book attempts to spark public discussion by revealing the tainted origins of modern policing as a tool of social control. It shows how the expansion of police authority is inconsistent with community empowerment, social justice\u2014 even public safety. Drawing on groundbreaking research from across the world, and covering virtually every area in the increasingly broad range of police work, Alex Vitale demonstrates how law enforcement has come to exacerbate the very problems it is supposed to solve.\n\n&gt;In contrast, there are places where the robust implementation of policing alternatives\u2014such as legalization, restorative justice, and harm reduction\u2014has led to a decrease in crime, spending, and injustice. The best solution to bad policing may be an end to policing.\n\nedit: Give this a listen as a quick alternative to reading the book:\n\n[Alex Vitale, author of The End of Policing, on why cops are being so brutal and what should be done with them](http://shout.lbo-talk.org/lbo/RadioArchive/2020/20_06_04.mp3)",

The citation was already filled out before they realized he had a 0.00 bac (3 other kids were drunk, and he did not drink). The cops apparently couldn't just throw it out on the spot. They acted like it was an easy fix, but it would have to be taken care of in court. \n\nSo he had to go to court over it, but he didn't get a lawyer because it was supposed to be an easy fix. But then the cop lied to the prescutor and said the breathalyzer was malfunctioning that night, but that my friend clearly had been drinking. Since any level of intox is illegal for a minor the prosecutor still wanted the full charge. The judge could have ruled that day, but he gave my friend a continuance to have time to talk to a lawyer. Even the judge recognized he was being railroaded, but rather than toss the case he rescheduled it. \n\nMy friend ended up needing a lawyer to plead it down to a civil infraction to avoid probation and a permanent mark on his record. The justice system failed at every level. The cop, prosecutor, and judge all knew he wasn't guilty of anything. But they still got their fines and fees out of him before they let him off with an impeding traffic charge.",

I call 911 immediately and explain. The tow truck got there before the cops. State police show up like 5 minutes later. The first words out of his mouth were, you lost control due to those flairs? Then said \u201cyeah I tried running them over about 10 minutes before you\u201d. They actually felt bad. Said they weren\u2019t writing me a ticket. Drove me home.  \n  \nI get a ticket in the mail a few days later for reckless driving or something. uhhhhh. What? I had to buy the police report and they lied throughout the whole thing saying I lost control due to a pulled over police cruiser. Diagrams and everything. Completely false. How the hell did the tow truck get there before you if you were already on scene? Spoke to an attorney and they said since I wasn\u2019t seriously injured it wasn\u2019t worth it. Plus his firm did work for the state police so he couldn\u2019t handle it anyway. Bunch of crooks. Was a slam dunk case. Wish I wasn\u2019t young and stupid",

Tl;dr - Dude went to his daughters highschool graduation, went home that night and played crash bandicoot with his girlfriend, someone called a noise complaint, cops show up and bang on the door in the middle of the night, he answers it, they shoot him in the back 3 time and kill him (he answered the door with a handgun in hand as is legal and right in Arizona when you dont know who is banging on your door at midnight). \n\nThe cops said \"He came at us with a gun\" when the girlfriend asked why they shot him. In the back. The video clearly shows he was attempting to put the gun down once he realized it was police.\n\nThere has been no justice for this family yet.",

It's disgusting of all of them honestly. Especially Clinton and Obama who both enjoyed the privilege of never having something so insignificant and stupid ruin their entire lives. Millions of people who live their lives as slaves because of marijuana while people who drink and drive get charged with misdemeanors and given endless second chances. \n\nThis country needs reform across the board and we HAVE to end the two-party system.

Point is: if cops search a person or property on probable cause and it fails to produce grounds for charges then it's the search that becomes legally dubious and questionable, if the citizen is subject to review why isn't the state? The government isn't rule, Law is, so the police are subject to it even as representatives, not above it.",

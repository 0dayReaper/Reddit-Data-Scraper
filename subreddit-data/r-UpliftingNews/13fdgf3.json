We're not a big tipping culture, most people who get decent tips get them for exceptional service. For the company to then yoink them away and say \"good job, thanks very much\" is outlandish.\n\nThere does need to be a mechanism for tips to go to back of house staff as well though.\n\nAlso I would hate to see this slowly become a way of justifying paying staff below minimum wage, as happens in some places in the US with the theory that tips make up the shortfall.",

People only get tips for exceptional service, and even then its not really expected. The issue was that even when people DID give tips sometimes the emplyer would simply take them away and there was nothing the employee could do about it.\n\nThis law is intended to change that.\n\nMy concern is that it opens the door to slowly morph into a system more like the US. It hasn't happened yet, and nobody is being encouraged to tip, but lets see what happens.",

I still don't understand why people aren't paid a living wage to begin with. Both Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt said minimum wage is supposed to be a living wage. There's no zip code in America where a person can afford a one bedroom apartment working 40hrs/week on minimum wage. It's crazy",

I just walked past a table with people giving them out for free and I was like ok why not?",

Still am, if my primary care physician didn\u2019t ask and offer every free visit I get I wouldn\u2019t get them now either probably. And I\u2019m the only one of my coworkers that actually goes to their doctor once year for a checkup, lots of people like me but even lazier.\n\nThat\u2019s not to detract, I\u2019ve had the flu shot every year since starting a job, but really that\u2019s because for whatever reason these are more accessible to adults. My job will bring people in to do it, yet that never happened in college that I remember.\n\nSometimes people will do it but you have to basically not make them go out of their way",

I don't interact with many people so it was not a huge concern so I waited and maybe forgot about it a little bit.\n\n\nI'm pro-vax.  People infinitely smarter than me invented it and it's such an obvious benefit for \"society\" with 0.000....0001 risk of complications and next to no effort on my part.\n\nIt's not like my opinion changed or I only did it because my employer demanded it.  There are 16 million medical related jobs.  Those should probably been the first vaxxed.  22%  of the usa are under 18 and 17% are over 65.  Together almost 40% of the total population are outside working age in the usa.  The young ones can't get it and the old ones should.  I'm outside of both those categories.   All my grandparents have been dead 20+ years even though I'm only 36.  I'm not risking anyone by delaying it.  The handful of people I interact with aren't terribly at risk sorts.\n\nI don't interact with eldery or children or even that many ordinary adults.  Don't go bar hopping.  I go to the grocery store, and that's about it.  I'm not completely incompetent and if I could get a syringe mailed to me I'd be able to inject myself with the vaccine.",

The latest spike in COVID cases is quickly becoming on par with the peak in 2020.\n\nStates like Florida and Texas are near full capacity for emergency rooms and ICU\u2019s.

They\u2019re reaching all time highs for COVID cases and deaths *right now.*",

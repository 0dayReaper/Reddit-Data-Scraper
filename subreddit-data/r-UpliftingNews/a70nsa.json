There are of course special circumstances but they're few and far between. \n\nIf I consistently work longer, people assume that you're not prioritising correctly, or are just poor at your job. In the UK (and no doubt other places) its worn like a badge of honour. \n\nIts soooo much easier to switch off after work now, its such a nicer work environment, and I get so much more done, at a much higher quality. Its amazing, its obvious too, but that doesn't stop it being amazing. \n\n",

People who work in minimum wage jobs usually have to go in sick or risk their jobs. So fast food workers are handling food etc while they have the flu. \n\nI have one friend who worked retail on black Friday (mandatory) and she had even gone to the doctor and was diagnosed with the flu. It turned into pneumonia a week later. She worked until she was actually hospitalized because she wasn't taking time to rest and recover. \n\nLuckily she had short term disability so she got paid foe missed work in the hospital but that meant she was out of work longer. So her employer had to pay her more whereas if ahe had just had paid sick leave ahe likely wouldn't have missed as much work. \n\nOn top of that she handled the money and such of thousands of people while she had the flu. \n\n",

If you were sick, you could have up to 10 days off, no questions asked. After that, if you still needed time off they'd roll you into short-term disability. In two years, I can't recall seeing more than a single person out sick at a time. Maybe it happened, not really sure. I personally probably used about 4 days total. \n\nThen I switched jobs to one that has 2 weeks PTO total. People come in sick all the time. In a year, I've seen almost entire departments grind to a halt with half probably should be hospitalized and the other half as in-office zombies. The flu drags on forever because people won't rest, they try to power through it. \n\nI wonder which company came out ahead with regards to their sick policy. ",

There are also other reasons, such as supporting business hours, or other teams/partners/vendors/supplies hours. I understand that my employees are not engaged 100% of the time I pay them for, but I still need them to be in the office in order to support that *potential* business. \n\nEasy to count isn't really a factor - you would need to be a real asshole to conflate hours worked with productivity in white collar environments.",

It\u2019s leftover british class society bullshit inherited from the old dead empire.  The working class are filthy animals whose lives have no inherent value, their only value as people is measured by the market value of the product of their work.  In this ideology, working less than 40 hours means you\u2019re worth less as a human being.  Whereas, once you have a herd of human cattle doing your bidding, well, the entire point, as their naturally superior master, is to have more time to pursue your own thoughts and interests, because you have inherent value, and your thoughts and deeds are precious.  All this is evidenced by the situation existing.  Look at the willingness of your working stock to show up every day, live up to the ideology, reinforce it whenever possible, and police each other for you.  The US has developed as little as possible from the 17th century british colony it started out as.",

Sure they have cute anecdotes too, but the way they talk about their lives makes the kid thing seem so not worth it :/ I watch them struggle to word things so that it doesn't seem like they resent those of us without the responsibility of children... but I can't help but wonder what they're really thinking.\n\nI've got student loans to pay off, I'm not exactly flush with cash (and I think they think I am.) Loans are basically my late-20s financial equivalent burden to having a kid. I am pretty flush with time though, and that's invaluable.\n\nIf the work week/ culture or our education system were structured differently, I'd consider a family life, but the current system seems really determined to punish parents which is massively unfair.

I'd miss seeing my fiance due to her shift work as I'd be away from home for a full 12 hours if I account for travel times.\n\nThe point is many offices don't even have enough work to sustain them for a full 8 hours, 5 days a week. A lot of productivity is saddled alongside people pissing away their time rather than actually working because they're exhausted and need to take more frequent breaks. 15 minutes on reddit here and there add up. Sadly, there's no logical room for reducing the time one appears in the office while being paid the same, in the mind of an owner/manager. Many will never make the connection that the pay is worth the same for the same result, in the end. We're all just chaining each other to workstations in the name of arbitrary historic customs.",

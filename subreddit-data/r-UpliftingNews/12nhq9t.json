People need to die. It's tragic when it's a child or young adult,  but in a way I think it's just nature's built-in population control, cold as that sounds. Increased therapy and comfort measures,  absolutely,  and I'm not saying not to test something that's treatable,  but we're destroying our environment pretty efficiently without being immortal.",

I want to get really old and shit in a diaper so I have time to buy more plastic things so they get into the water and cause more cancer. Hospital execs will love it!\n    Really,  I'm not meaning nature in a philosophical way. I just mean that actual nature,  like our planet,  requires us to die in a timely fashion. If what you're saying is that we're already past that tipping point,  yeah,  probably. If you're saying that technology will catch up and fix it all,  I just don't have enough faith in that happening quickly enough. \n    To be fair, my view on death is pretty lax. Doesn't scare me. I don't really mourn people, just miss them. I think it's all part of the cycle. Now I'm getting philosophical. Bah!",

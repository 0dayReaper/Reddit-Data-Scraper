Unless it's like a 2-3 kWh system.. Even a 4khw system without battery is about \u00a35-6k these days.\n\nNo generation figures to hand either - or are you going to share UK averages? Where I live, 'average' is about 10kwh per day. So you get loads in the summer you can't use and fuck all in the winter when you need it (as low as 1kwh).. Good luck generating enough to satisfy demand in the winter here - so you would have an electric bill to pay as well..\n\nCan you share even which year you got yours installed - and whether you get FIT?",

Think of the sheer amount of petrol and diesel used in vehicles, the amount of gas used to heat domestic and commercial boilers, the amount of fuel used by the aviation industry, and so on.\n\nThe average UK home uses 2,900 kWh of electricity a year... and 12,000 kWh of gas. 14,900kWh of energy total. It looks far less impressive to say we converted 1,850kWh of 14,900kWh into renewables... which is why they only print the electricity stats.",

It was fear mongering that made the change and it was based on a book that was fiction. The meat industry used poke and sniff for decades, only recently they stopped using it. What they did made it easier for bacteria to be spread across food. Since you have less smaller businesses as well, that supply, so when the big corps have a problem it's much bigger than just a few people. It's miraculous that technology and knowledge is so widespread. That's how things have improved all round for the better. You have to look at data at the largest set before things get implemented and see if it was already improving or not or is it even better? \n\nI don't believe any kind of corruption is reasonable, I believe people should be held accountable especially if they're the \"professional\" that's in a trusted position.\n\nFood poisoning is still incredibly common... FDA isn't there watching over every meal, all the procedures for transporting food, and their regulations suck ass. Companies have more rigorous rules than theirs, they are afraid to lose money, FDA doesn't care that much compared to the fat man raking in the cash.\n\nI understand the sentiment of wanting to be protected and we should be, but they aren't as helpful as we think. Companies do the bare minimum while also trying to make sure they are doing enough to not have problems. Small businesses are a different story and are much better for everyone due to a multitude of better reasons.\n\nPeople sure don't do the research and like to pretend they're protected when getting delivery, eating at a restaurant, fast food, or even at a grocery. I've worked in grocery stores, and very \"good\" ones that are considered more high end and I must say you'd be disillusioned pretty fast with how bad the food is.",

I thought I'd just pay for the disposable bags because it's convenient and I reuse them to scoop out cat litter and line small trash bins. But the grocery store baggers started getting stingy with the bags. They'd load too much into one bag, making it more likely to tear. And they'd leave \"large\" items like cereal boxes and chip bags outside of bags entirely, figuring I'd rather carry these items individually than pay 10 cents for an extra bag or two. So anyway, this is the reason I switched to reusable bags, not the cost of the bags.  I'm glad I switched too because reusable bags hold 2x-3x stuff per bag, making it way easier to bring in the groceries. Plus no fear of the bag ripping when wresting the bags out of the car. Anyway, I definitely recommend getting into a  reusable bags habit, it's kinda nice.",

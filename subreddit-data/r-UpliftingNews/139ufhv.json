Infection increased a protein related to Parkinson\u2019s disease. Infection also killed a significant number of worms suggesting it may be just stressing them out. They also infected worms with the same bacteria from normal people which also increase the same proteins, but not as much.",

I suffer from it and EDS and am surprised by how much my symptoms can overlap with major, recognized neurological diseases (even if mine isn\u2019t). \n\nThe number of patients with EDS has been really crazy to me. It\u2019s severely under diagnosed and no one takes the often severe neurological symptoms that come with it seriously. It seems to run in peoples families but get much worse with each generation. My grandma was in pain but she never presented with symptoms like mine. My elbows and neck seem to be attached to nothing.",

                    "comment": "I can see the logic, but it seems like this could be a real opportunity and they are missing out. I'd love to see a program where, if you collect trash for 20 hours a week every week for a month, you get transitional housing and an increase to 30 hours a week. Another month and you get full time (salaried, 25-40k depending on region) and health benefits and a financial counselor to help plan for the future. After 6 months, you would be expected to move out of the transitional housing and into an apartment of your own. Do that, and you will probably have some really dedicated employees and a cleaner city. And once they've had enough of a work history beautifying the city, they can move on to more personally meaningful work, freeing up a position for another homeless person.\n\nEdit: Woo, go to a meeting, come back to 100 replies. In reply to the common refrain \"that's more than I make!\" Yeah, your salary is fucking bullshit and we need to address that too. Workers need to unite in this country and take back the profits we've been making for our corporate masters. $12.50 (the lowest amount I've suggested) is *barely* a living wage in most parts of the country. If you make less than that, you probably work two jobs or have multiple roommates. That's fucking bullshit and not something we should just roll over and accept and bitch when someone gets a better opportunity. We can't create programs that pay people shit just because other people are paid shit. We need to increase the minimum wage to an actual living wage.\n\nIn reply to the comments about how would we pay for this? Taxes, man. We pay for it by taxing the absurdly wealthy and the corporations that run our country. We have [some of the lowest tax rates](https://bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Free_Resources/Federal-Income-Tax-Rates.aspx) in our national history right now. Just a bit higher than the Great Depression. Trickle down economics is a lie. We need to tax more.\n\nI should also clarify the housing component. Transitional housing doesn't mean *free* housing. They would still have to pay for it. They just couldn't be turned away for lack of rental history, lack of income, etc. The rent would still need to come out of their paycheck, and they would still need to go through the process of paying it (i.e. not automatically deduced from pay).\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold and silver! While I greatly appreciate the awards, I ask anyone else who wishes to award this comment to please consider donating to your local food bank, homeless shelter, or soup kitchen instead.",

There's absolutely no way you've worked a white-collar job for 7.5 years and you dont make more than $12.50/hr. Thats bonkers.

You cannot artificially increase it without the rest of the market reflecting it.\n\n&gt;Everytime the minimum wage goes up I cringe for 2 reasons. \n\n&gt;1. Anybody making slightly more than minimum wage just got a pay reduction because most jobs aren't going to boost their income in that case.\n\n&gt;2. Many people will be thrown in higher tax brackets, forced to pay a higher percentage in taxes for the same lifestyle they had.\n\n&gt;Example: California estimated that the last increase in minimum wage would pull 400,000 people out of poverty, and would cost the market 500,000 jobs. Great, our definition of poverty doesn't even compare to other countries, and we just made 100,000 people lose their job.\n\n&gt;The minimum wage jobs like taking your order, holding the door, and brewing coffee aren't supposed to be a way to make a living. It's a way to introduce younglings into the job market. \n\n&gt;After hearing my graduating classmates talk about their job offers it's become clear to me about how to get a better job. Sell yourself like you're going to make a business much better, and over-exaggerate your qualifications. Employers are super picky, and believe it or not there's a ton of jobs that only require a fake-it-til-you-make-it skillset, it's more about the personability skills (and a bit of fibbing).\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a Boomer or just someone who has sucked up the garbage they\u2019ve been spewing. \nYou don\u2019t seem to know how tax brackets work or that we can adjust them when we make a significant shift in the minimum wage. \n\nServing coffee and holding doors shouldn\u2019t be a way to make a living. But they\u2019ve gutted the economy and often these are the only job available to people. \n\nAnd sure, you to sell yourself as a fantastic worker and magically get that better job, but you beat out 15 other people for the role who have had their confidence weathered by years of underemployment, who also have no choice but to take the jobs serving coffee and holding doors. \n\nWe\u2019ve got to imagine a better world, friend! And the we have to work together to achieve it!",

Welding for example, is an incredibly lucrative trade that loses 10 welders for every new one that comes in every year. Another one is elevator repair, HVAC, the list goes on but there is this mentality in America that I have heard described as \"Even the poorest American thinks he is just a temporarily embarrassed millionaire\" (I think it comes from schools pushing college education super hard the last 25 years or so) there are jobs out there even for people with only a GED. That said 7.25 is the min wage in my state and that shit is fucked.",

Drive by these places like homeless shelters, methadone clinics, and halfway houses and there is almost always a few people causing trouble. You have assault s, aggressive panhandling, and maybe someone gets stabbed once in awhile. It's not a made up concern. If shelters were historically good neighbors and took more responsibility it wouldn't be as big of a problem. Police aren't going to show up every time to babysit these antisocial behaviors so the result is nobody wants them around.\n\n\nI know of non-profits building mixed use housing for these type of people. They hang around outside glaring at people and it has hurt surrounding businesses.",

Sadly, I think you're right. Until we shake up leadership, it will always be hard to get these programs off the ground. I used to work at a Pizza Hut where most of us struggled with financial security, so we understood how valuable something like a meal could actually be. We used to let homeless folks sweep the parking lot on Sundays in exchange for as much pizza and salad as they wanted from the pizzas on the buffet that were approaching the \"toss-out\" window. That was, until corporate found out. They made us end the program even though it was pizza we were going to throw away anyway. Leadership can really suck sometimes.",

But you can also create systems to help people who need mental health care without just putting them in an asylum. Maybe there are staffed half-way houses that some of them can live in where they can get treatment. Many mental health issues can be controlled with treatment (some, not all, just to be clear) and medicine and someone could be re-integrated. They might have been getting help before becoming homeless but something happened and they stopped being able to get help. They might have already been on the path to getting better and then lost their job and insurance or who knows what. We can't just dismiss an entire program become a fraction of the people who could be helped can't be. One person out of a 100 failing the program doesn't mean the entire program is a failure.",

While I can see how you read it that way, I definitely just meant guaranteed transitional housing.

Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. \n\nEventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. \n\nAs a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse.",

They aren't payed by the amount of trash they pick up, so making more trash would make their job harder, not easier.\n\n2. They're given specific locations to go to and pick up trash. Unless you think they would dump a bunch of trash on the side of the road and then tell their bosses they need to go work in the exact place they left the trash I don't see how that would benefit them.\n\n3. It's not like the entire state is going to run out of trash one day, requiring the homeless to make their own.\n\nIt's possible some politician made the \"Cobra effect\" argument to justify the cap, but I think the much more likely reason is that the program running this doesn't have the funding to pay people full time.",

The problem with helping these people is because it's hard and expensive to help addicts who often have mental health issues. Although this doesn't apply to people who are homeless for purely financial reasons, but those aren't usually tho ones you see sleeping in the street and begging.\n\nI do wonder how a person like that will react to getting a steady income, will they waste all of their money on drugs or will they save some and improve their lives, can this in itself help them towards revuilding their lives?",

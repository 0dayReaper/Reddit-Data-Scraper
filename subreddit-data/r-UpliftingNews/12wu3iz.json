But I don't have to evaluate who is good or bad to come to the conclusion that it (WWI) was a pointless slaughter. One that was gloryfied for ideological purposes before, during and after the war by different political movements. One way to achieve that goal would be  by producing such items with no functional connection to the actual war itself. What purpose did the sword have at all? None for the fighting I dare say. It is a relic that suggests an honorable fight man to man, which is pretty far from the german historical experience. I do not claim to speak for every german nor in a more ignorant form for the general experience of other groups neither.",

Recently there have been a few posts from someone sharing his great grandfather's letters from Stalingrad. We love history and it's memoribilia, we just don't enjoy glorifying their circumstances.\n\nThe reactions to speaking of that history always heavily depend on the context and manner it is brought up.\n\n\nHowever there's still always the handful of people who'd rather not have anything to do with it at all. Generally speaking though, we treat remembering it as a very important part of our culture (as to never repeat it) to the point of having our own word for it (\"Erinnerungskultur\") in which artifacts of the times, especially personal ones, play a huge role.",

I'm sorry ( to anyone Japanese ) I can't remember what they're called ) but they're apparently pretty important to families.\n\nAmerican GI's brought them home as war souvenirs. Anyway, our family ended up with one which was weird because we didn't have any family members in that theater. Yes, you can sell them BUT you can also send them to this specific organization that returns them ( or at least tries ) to the man's family. \n\nThat's what we did- it's just eerie in a tragic way seeing different writing on those flags and thinking about the day that guy left and never came home. Organization also keeps you updated on if the family was found. So far the one we sent hasn't been, they'll let us know.\n\nMaybe contact that organization ? Guessing they'll at least have some ideas about what to do ?",

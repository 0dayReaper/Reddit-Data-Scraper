If you placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that make sense. But you find yourself in the ocean, 20 foot wave, I'm assuming off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full grown 800 pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends, you lose that battle, you lose that battle 9 times out of 10. And guess what, you've wandered into our school of tuna and we now have a taste of lion. We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated and said 'You know what, lion tastes good, let's go get some more lion'. We've developed a system to establish a beach-head and aggressively hunt you and your family and we will corner your pride, your children, your offspring.",

Please enjoy it for its hilarity, and no one was hurt. Yeah better choices could have been made. Lessons were learned.  \n\nStory time! My old boss and I were always quoting movies. Especially that scene while at work. One day he has a party at his place. I'm 2nd to arrive, he and his former Marine friend have already had some whiskey. Since it's just us and I had just added the laser to my Shield 9mm I show it to the marine friens. I hand it to him saying, \"mags loaded chambers empty.\" I go to use the bathroom. I hear a muffled pop. I think, naaaahhh surely not. I go out to find my boss wide eyed holding his ears yelling, \"WOW THAT WAS LOUD!\" and his marine friend looking just like the PTSD Vietnam flashback Chihuahua meme. Turns out my boss only heard, \"it's empty\" and picked it up off the  desk where the marine had looked at it and set it down. Boss then picked it up. Acts like a gangster in a movie &amp; racked it. He then reenacted the desk pop scene.",

They bust down the door and rush in and dude had killed his family and himself.\n\nOfficer who'd been talking to the guy walks back outside, sits down on a little retaining wall on the street front edge of the property -- dozens of other cops, media, paramedics, etc. within 20' of the guy -- and his shoulders slump for like a second, and then *like that* his gun is in his hand and he's already put a bullet through the bottom of his chin.\n\nAfter I graduated I spent a few years working as a domestic violence intervention specialist.  Not a cop, no sidearm.  So thankful for that, because there were days when I totally felt the impulse to just fucking give up and give in.  I ended up changing careers and working with cars because I decided that I'd done enough good that I could quit and didn't need to keep doing it until I drowned in it.",

Having other groups for mental health situations, etc that people are working to get put into place and clamoring for is just another logical thing to do. \n\nI think of it like with Animal Control. Sure, they're cops, but they are given special training and special gear to deal with animals without just shooting them. No cop wants to deal with an angry dog unless they have training and equipment to do so. And a gun isn't proper equipment for that, so why should it be for mental health issues or otherwise?",

Once I retired, it seemed like my body took a couple of months to \"de-stress\" and go back to normal. I always felt an undercurrent of stress, or feeling \"on guard\", but this felt normal to me.  Only after retirement did this feeling slowly fade away which made me realize that it wasn't normal. I'm pretty sure that if I was an active police officer again that this stress would slowly reappear and be with me 24/7. \n\nI never once thought of my service weapon or a violent response was a first resort. Everyone that I worked with had a pretty similar mindset. Over my career there were only a handful of shootings, and this was a department of about 1500 sworn officers. I think training and deescalation skills are sorely lacking in many police departments.",

Unless something else comes out of it that changes what's in the report, from what they reported it did sound like a good reason for a cop to actually use their gun. \n\nThere are still some times when a gun is required, as terrible as it is. It just should never be the first thing they reach for, unless they've exhausted other options or it's the only thing they can use (such as if someone is shooting at them. Once bullets start flying, de-escalation is probably not possible, in my opinion).",

If you look at domestic violence, you can write it down to domestic disturbance. If you have felony robbery, well there's such a thing as misdemeanor robbery for small amounts. Felony assault can be reclassified as a petty crime of \"fighting.\" \n\nI'm not saying that's happened here, or that I know of any study proving there's widespread juking of stats. but it seems strange to me that murder rates or violence rates can go up and crime go down in general. I just sometimes wonder if what was happening in Baltimore doesn't happen elsewhere.",

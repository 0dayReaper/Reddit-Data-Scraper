So we put solar panels in space where there's no atmosphere to get in the way. Solar panels get a *lot* more energy across their surface area than they would if they were on the ground.\n\nAlso in space they don't have to worry about this pesky thing called *Earth* getting in the way and blocking the sun half the time. You can just park the whole solar array in geosynchronous (essentially stationary) orbit in a spot where it can absorb sunlight 24/7. Then it can beam the electricity anywhere on Earth that needs it and is set up to receive it.\n\ntl;dr\n\nJewish Space Lasers upset Magic the Gathering players by typing in infinite energy cheat code.",

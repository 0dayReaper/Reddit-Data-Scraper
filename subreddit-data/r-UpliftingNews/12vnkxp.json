Pay off the cars, maybe splurge a little and get like a new &lt; 80k vehicle. Pay off my debts. Throw down 20k into bonds, cap out the 401k for the year and then start a CD ladder while also throwing down like 50k into a high yield savings account.\n\nThe above at least ensures you came out ahead; from there open an LLC, and invest with that this way you'll only look like the fool that largely mismanaged their winnings but the LLC will protect you from being in an incredibly poor position since you can bankrupt the company but keep all your personal assets (including what remains of your winnings).\n\nThis would be my own personal advice; I am sure it ain't amazing but if I had the cash this is what I would do first.\n\nIn terms of investing with the LLC... I would likely sink cash into properties, housing demand outpaces builders significantly so any new community would be great to land a few rentals in... though because of the LLC you could be a bit more risky.",

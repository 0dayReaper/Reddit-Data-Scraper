But he says his favorite audiences have 4 legs and a tail. Stessel volunteered his talents to St. Hubert\u2019s Animal Welfare Center in New Jersey. Together, they captured videos of dogs getting one-on-one magic shows. Many of the dogs showcased have found their forever homes, but Stessel insists, it\u2019s not his magic that\u2019s getting these pups adopted.",

The big cotton plantations were very profitable, as were select other factories and farms, but by the end of it it was really just the larger slave corps that were bringing in all the money and a lot of the smaller companies and owners ended up selling their slaves, freeing them, or the slaves ran away, and unfortunately many also were killed. \n\nTerrible times, but I do think it's important to recognize that the world has always been based on money, even with free labor. \n\nAnother fact people don't realize is that many Native tribes had both black and white slaves, while others were friends to blacks and whites.",

Making sure your employees get paid their livable wages should be goal number one for any business. **You're literally being defensive and apologetic for someone's poor business and life choices.**\n\nEvery year and every quarter businesses have budgets, and if you go over that budget it gets your business in trouble, if you're explicitly borrowing against your business while lowering wages and maximizing profits you're handicapping your business and fucking over your employees. This is all bad business and again, that just means that they don't deserve to have a business.\n\nI'll give my son's former employers as an example, my son is a cook, loves cooking, now he's doing it on his own. Before that he had a boss at a wing place he ran, this lady would take trips and and buy luxury items and then pay her workers as little as she could, and that's when she was able to pay them, this lady literally tried to pay my kid with an IOU and wouldn't pay him until I pushed him to get a lawyer. When he relented on the lawyer she begged him to stay, as she couldn't run the business herself without him, so he pushed for a raise and got one. So he became the most paid employee, and the only one getting his checks on time, and the owner made sure to let all of his coworkers know that he was \"getting their raises and paychecks\" and built up the resentment until he quit. So then she can't find another manager as good as he was and as underpaid as he was and she begged him to come back, after creating this toxic workplace for him, and again offered him more money and a guaranteed paycheck. \n\nThe moral of the story is that this lady doesn't deserve to own a business, again, **if you can't pay your workers a livable wage, and can't pay them on time, treat your workers poorly and create toxic work environments, and embezzle from your business, then you do not deserve to own a business.**",

The cool thing about customer service and horticultural service, a lot of it can be trained to entry level workers to make them skilled workers. I\u2019d wager most BK employees know how to work in a team environment too, maybe even have exposure to the cannabis product they\u2019re selling lol; it\u2019s not like BK employees are unskilled workers, if they know how to make a BK burger or onion rings, they probably can learn how to stock and maintain a store.\n\nAll it takes is a good leader, the high schoolers that I\u2019ve trained in customer service (not in the cannabis industry) have been pretty malleable and open to direction. I\u2019ve met some really amazing customer service folks in my time as a trainer that just needed proper direction as they entered the workforce.",

So as a result many BK\u2019s serve subpar food as a result. \n\nBut when you find a good one that\u2019s well managed, they really are better than McDonald\u2019s. McDonald\u2019s however drills quality control into their franchises so while the food isn\u2019t as good (IMO) their quality is what it\u2019s supposed to be so overall they\u2019re better.\n\nI don\u2019t eat at either of places much anymore but for a treat I would pick Burger King. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re taking a gamble as to whether you\u2019re going to get lucky and find a good one.",

It's bizarre how people will create whole narratives about corporations and brands in their head based on anecdotal or outright wrong information.

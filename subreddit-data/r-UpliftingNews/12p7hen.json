The company has developed a thymus-empowered T-cell therapy platform, called ProTcell, \u201cto fully and rapidly re-arm the immune system.\u201d\n\nThe technology coaxes stem cells in a lab to become immature \u201cprogenitor\u201d T-cells. Injected into the body, they mature in under 100 days into a crucial part of the immune system. That compares to the 18 months an immune-compromised patient needs to rebuild the immune system following a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nThe funding will go toward an early-stage trial to rebuild leukemia patients\u2019 immune systems after chemotherapy.",

Thirdly governments are limited to their own self-interest. the bill and Miranda Gates Foundation works on causes across the globe. They're not limited to any geopolitical boundaries.\n\nYou seem to be missing one point. Bill Gates is not avoiding paying his taxes. He does pay his taxes. There are billionaires and multi-millionaires out there that don't pay any taxes. Bill Gates is not one of them.\n\n Gates, whose income from 2013 to 2018 was an average of $2.85bn a year, paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 18.4% \n\n\nThe money that he's donating to charity is money he has left over after he has already paid his taxes. You can't just keep taxing somebody because they still have more money left. That's not the way taxes work. Well at least it's not supposed to be the way they work.\n\nIt seems to be that a lot of people feel that Bill Gates is using the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as a tax shelter. If you look at that you'll see how ridiculous that sounds. He's essentially given 95% of his wealth to charity. No one is going to give 95% of their wealth away to avoid paying 40% of it in taxes. If hoarding his wealth was what his desire was he could simply not give his money away to charity. If keeping all of his money was his intent it would be much cheaper to keep it all and just pay the highest tax percentage.\n\nThe original idea for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was not \" gee how can I afford paying taxes on all this money\" it was \" I see problems that are occurring worldwide. How can I use my money to make positive changes, and how can I convince other billionaires to throw their money in as well.\"",

It's highly unlikely in 2023 that they will make the same mistakes that were made in 1963.\n\nSo in answer to your question \n\nProbably not. But hopefully they will end up eradicating cancer like the later polio vaccines did.\n\nWill some people try to ignore the overall successes , in stead focusing on failures or mis steps along the way ?most definitely.",

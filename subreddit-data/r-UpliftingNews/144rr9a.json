However, its one of those programs that *costs more money to facilitate the more successful it is*. Since the host organization needs to pay a certain amount per recipient, the cost continues to climb as participation goes up. \n\nWith this in mind, consider donating to the host organization for DPIL in your community. It's 100% worth it. The body of research regarding early childhood development and literacy is hard to ignore.",

California also has the most diverse population in the states with over 200 individual languages being spoken. While the schools are definitely underfunded considering how much cash CA has, it can\u2019t fully be blamed on the school system when parental factors and wealth inequality play a big role.",

My small midwestern school district in a town of 50k faces very similar issues with students because of the agriculture industry. A lot of students from Mexico, Central America, South America, and more recently Africa. Many of these students start with little to no English skills. Many times they have the best English skills in their household. But despite this most end up being proficient in English within a year because of intensive ESL programs implemented by the school district. To help this issue even further, my old elementary school is now an adult educational center focusing on English language skills. They offer evening classes and provide childcare while in class. \n\nCalifornia\u2019s problem was they seemed to have had no programs in place to deal with these issues for some reason even though they could afford them. I would kindly describe my local school board to be incompetent chucklekfucks but they appear to be more competent than California\u2019s DoE.",

I said, \"New Arrivals it is\".  That program was awesome.  Those kids soaked up English like sponges.  Mine were the only ones who weren't kids of migrant farm laborers.

Opinions may differ on whether that\u2019s a worthwhile expenditure of money (I certainly don\u2019t think so) but don\u2019t paint it as pure philanthropy. It is absolutely not and not remotely the best way to help disadvantaged areas.",

I went on short term mission trips like this, and I took other people on trips like this. The benefit really tends to fall on those who go and experience the trip, more than those they go to \"serve.\" \n\nI genuinely appreciate the heart behind projects like these, but sometimes they way they are carried out takes much needed, paying work away from builders and crews in the area. Not to mention, using volunteers to build homes instead of tradesmen can lead to longevity or safety issues. \n\n(It was painful to write all of that because it does seem like such a lovely gesture. But it is part of the honest conversation surrounding missions work, particularly short term missions, and our responsibility to acknowledge and mediate unintended consequences.)",

And yes, when lots and lots of churches are doing this, it takes work away from local workers.\n\nAnd you're ignoring the point that having volunteers build a house isn't as safe as having trained, qualified people do it.\n\nBut [here are some resources.](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2022/01/22/the-paradox-of-voluntourism-how-international-volunteering-impacts-host-communities/)  This has been [studied and debated](https://medium.com/sojourners-heart/the-positive-and-negative-effects-of-a-short-term-mission-trip-c9991876ddc9).  These are concerns that are brought up by [Christians who have been on these trips](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/still-cancel-short-term-mission-trip/) and [seen how they affect communities in the long term.](https://missionguide.global/articles/five-mission-trip-pitfalls-to-avoid) They aren't just my cynical rantings, they are real issues that should be discussed and considered when supporting these types of ministries.\n\nGood intentions don't negate unintended consequences. Pretending these issues don't exist doesn't make them go away. If people truly want to do good, they need to understand the whole picture and not just run with what they want, regardless of the true impact. A gift given without any regard to how it actually impacts the recipient isn't a good gift.",

My only personal experience with international \"voluntourism\" was going to Jamaica as a 15 year old with some cousins where we installed a new tin roof for a lady. It took a whole whopping morning of work, she went from basically no roof to a free long term roof and was overwhelmed with gratitude to the point it made a big impression on young me. Then we spent the rest of our three days down there doing tourist stuff and spending our money. Which brings me to my next question.\n\nWouldn't the foreign money brought in and jobs created from tourism more than offset the potential work taken from locals? There is a real lack of capital in these communities. I'm speaking very generally here, I'm sure there are plenty of anecdotes that support what you're saying with unqualified volunteers doing more taking than giving. But I haven't seen that to be the norm in my own experience. Hence my surprise at the level of cynicism you are presenting.",

In a coastal state you're unlikely to freeze to death if you run out of gas, but are a lot more likely to be sued if someone gets overcharged or something happens with the fuel lines and no one was there to corroborate the incident. \n\nMeanwhile many colder states even have laws to protect people who had to break into cars or buildings so they can get warm and prevent themselves from freezing to death. I'd imagine ensuring people can get gas so they can keep a car running might have similar protections; though that's only speculation on my behalf. ",

We sold lottery tickets, cigarettes, milk, bread, magazines, newspapers, basically a small corner store. \n\nWe were having renovations done and had to close for a day. We had signs up throughout the store for a few weeks before the renovations. On the day of the renovations, I was the employee chosen to stay in the store and basically just hold down the fort (AKA read magazines in the break room) while the builders did their stuff. The lights were off, it was very dark inside, and all you could see from the outside of the store was some ladders and power tools and plywood and stuff. \n\nI had at least one person every ten minutes who - despite seeing the lights off and the building full of power tools and the giant red CLOSED FOR RENOVATION sign - decided to bash themselves against the automatic glass doors because surely the store *must* be open! No joke, once they realised the doors weren\u2019t opening themselves, they would start trying to slide them and push them. \n\nMost of them were apologetic when I eventually unlocked the front doors and told them we were closed. For some of them, it was like the gates of hell had been unleashed. The sweetest elderly ladies and gents would release a hoard of insults and complaints that I wouldn\u2019t just let them in to buy their loaf of bread. \n\n*There\u2019s a grocery store 50 feet from here, Sharon. By your loaf of bread there.*",

As much nice things gets said about Canada, and it is indeed flattering and I feel proud for it all, it is definitely lacking in some of the larger communities. Seems Canada is more Canadian when you explore the smaller towns villages. Once you get to the metro it's definitely all up in the air.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been to Iceland. Iceland seems more Canadian than Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause, seriously, mothers leave their strollers outside on the street against the store that they're in, and everyone watches out for that stroller.  I went on a tour through Reykjavik with an awesome woman and she's pointing out all these excellent things in their culture.\n\nIt's largely trust based. There's this garden with 100yr old statues and anybody can just walk in. There's no fences around the statues. You can get as close as you want - but you should only get as close as you need to. I like that. And it's amazing - also sad because I feel like that isn't going to last long as the country grows in tourism and with immigration. I would so love to leave Canada and move there because I want to practice those incredible values and experience how great it is. I would pour my heart into learning Icelandic fluently and help fund ways to preserve that language because it's endangered.  It's definitely a dream of mine since my visit, and talking with people there. I'm at awe with how refreshing it was to visit there.",

She would do stuff like buy stuff with a coupon or on sale and try and return it later or to a different store (without the receipt so for more money) or she would try and peel off 50% off stickers and put them on what she wanted. Apparently corporate would not let them ban her so she carried on with this stuff for more than a year while I worked there until they started printing an extra copy of every one of her receipts so when she went to customer service and \"lost her receipt\" they'd say no problem, lets see which one it is lmao.",

I just thought that I was the only person who would choose to spend a beautiful summer day at a nuclear power plant visitor center. After browsing the displays in the visitor center I realized that not only was I the only visitor - there was no staff either. I left quickly. Stole nothing. ",

They're always stocked with canned food, so you'll arrive usually in the evening after hiking for a day, eat whatever you need, and write down what you ate. When you're back home at the end of your trip you pay it all back, along with a list so they know what to restock.",

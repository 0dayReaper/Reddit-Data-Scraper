For some of them we would have to mix a thickening agent into their drinks (coffee, tea, water, juice) and the spoon feed them. \nThis product skips a step and gives the person the ability to feed themselves again. I hope the inventor wins a goddamn Nobel prize for this.  ",

You can give fluids by IV to everyone too, but if you can drink from a glass, that's a really expensive/unnecessary way to get hydrated.\n\nPeople with brain injuries have weird reactions to things, both things they get and things they don't get.

So he used sensory deprivation tools and VR tools to get a better understanding of the issue, spoke with a dementia psychologist, spent a week living in a dementia care home, consulted with doctors about how to create a hydrating product, and returned to the care home several times to test the prototypes of his project. All in an effort to do something to help.*\n\nGood on this young man for going the extra mile to help his grandma.",

The gateway pattern is a result of having illegal sellers of these drugs due to prohibition in the first place.  If people bought their drugs from regulated companies or the government, there would be no push.  I think the US needs to reform drug advertising laws like they did cig ads before full legalization though.",

And that's ***exactly*** what they got - as that it was (and *IS*) a roaring success.\n\nDon't believe me? Here's the words, right from the horse's mouth:\n\n\u201cYou want to know what this was really all about?\u201d he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. \u201cThe Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d\n\n- John Ehrlichman, who\u00a0served 18 months in prison\u00a0for his\u00a0central role in the Watergate scandal, was Nixon\u2019s chief domestic advisor when the president\u00a0announced the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d\u00a0in 1971. \n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nixon-drug-war-racist_us_56f16a0ae4b03a640a6bbda1\n\nhttps://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/",

Every now and then she even manages to surprise me with an unexpected quip or ironic remark, while most of the time she\u2019s barely able to produce a short coherent sentence beyond common phrases or words.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not abusive or verbally aggressive.\n\nI\u2019ve seen her go through all stages so far, with ups and downs, but in her case, she\u2019s having a good life. She\u2019s 91, old and frail now, and taking care of her is really exhausting. My own social life is basically dead, but I wouldn\u2019t say hers is no life to live.\n\nThe mileage can vary a lot between dementia patients.\n\nEdit: I would say that the one thing that helped most in managing the worst problems was the fact that she\u2019s lived and still lives in a very stable environment (at home). And gradually I practiced a lot of everyday life things with her. One thing that was also vital was to accustom her to being touched pretty much everywhere. She was not the type of person to touch others a lot or being touched. But now she likes a good hug, and she doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable if I clean her or change her clothes etc. Years of conditioning and doing the same things over and over, slowly adapting to changes... I believe that\u2019s one of the keys to make a lot of things potentially easier. And this is one of the things that old-age homes mostly can\u2019t deliver, of course.\n\nAlso, learning to let go of feeling under pressure or thinking things have to get done in a certain time limit is important. Feeling under time pressure is poison for both sides. It took a little while to not feel annoyed anymore if I have to explain things 5 or 6 times if necessary. Patience gets you pretty far.\n\nAs long as the person you take care of isn\u2019t the aggressive kind, of course. But even then a calm demeanor can be helpful.",

I hope if I ever have dementia I hope I have someone as caring like you!\n\n In highschool I worked at an adult day care (sons/daughters working during the day and couldn't afford/want out of home overnight care) and most of our memory care patrons were quite lovely and nice, with only a few agitated enough to strike me (which was my fault) and one who cried all the time.  Most had no idea the year, how old they were, or what was going on, but enjoyed the activities, chatting to the guests and staff, politely trying to help clear the tables, etc.  This was a working class neighborhood in the boroughs, simple storefront place, which a wide mix of ethnicities and cultures, most of whom were quite pleasant. That said, many of them had lovely, caring families, and all had at least one person helping them with difficulties at night, so they mostly had the benefit of someone repeating over &amp; over, doing all the difficult leg work for us in dealing with changing clothes, showering, being comfortable enough to work with others in their care.  \nIt was actually difficult to notice any issues at first because they were all still so polite. I'd start chatting to a clear-as-a-bell senior discussing the weather or traffic, polite and cheerful, and she'd ask if I was in another class at our high school, she doesn't remember Sister introducing me. Or the wonderful, ancient old Brooklyn woman who was always scheming ways to get me to date her brother: 'We'll put on some records, I'll buy us some Cokes, I think I have enough in my ration book.\" \n\nActually, a lot of residents would go back to their teen/early 20's years,  I think it might be because those were the happiest for some of them.  I found that comforting at the time and still do. My thoughts have changed as my own father gets older; it would destroy me to lose the one I selfishly want to help and advise me still, and got someone who was a bit confused but happy living in a world before I was born.  I give you a lot of props for taking such good care of your mother.  I know it can't be easy.",

I beat myself up now because I'm guilty of not wanting to go see her just because I hated seeing her suffer and not be herself. It's really tough. Now that she has passed I feel as if she is at peace and it's a relief for myself and my family knowing that she isn't suffering anymore. I know how hard it can be on the loved ones of someone who suffers from dementia. Reach out if you would like to talk to anyone about it, it is better than keeping all the emotions in. ",

Not knowing she already had one. Of course Grandson offers the box and she keeping eating them, still holding onto the one she took earlier. Very interesting. \n\n(Also, for those asking the same thing - doesnt seem to be flavored, but the jellies are 90% water, 10% gel and electrolytes, to better combat dehydration. The color/shape alone seems to be appealing enough. Really well-thought out and executed!)",

You can stir if you'd like but make sure the spheres don't touch or they'll stick, and the longer you leave the sphere the thicker the gel coating on the outside.\n\nedit for spelling and you can find these recipes everywhere! sometimes its called caviar, I've also done this with yogurt but calcium lactate",

It was extremely difficult to keep her hydrated sometimes taking a few hours to get her to consume a glass of water especially due to an arachnoid cyst further complicating the issue of communication and memory. I made jelly/jello and ice cream for her but had to watch out for sugar intake due to the potential risk of developing diabetes by using steroids to treat her Bullous Pemphigoid. This is a brilliant idea and should help carers at least with one of the main issues carers have.",

My mom is currently experiencing the same thing after chemo. So hydrating gummies would have been a big blessing and our house!

Its truly a struggle to get them to drink water especially if they are in the late stages of Parkinson or dementia as they will choke on it or become violent. Their families just don't understand how important it is and even if we want to hook them up to an IV the families refuse because \"It looks institutional\". Its very tough when its just one of me and 10 people that don't want to drink anything. We could hire more staff put the families don't want to pay more for that. \n\nSo of course it gets to where we have to send them to the hospital.  All they want is sweets. In the summer months they just die from it. Its terrible to watch. ",

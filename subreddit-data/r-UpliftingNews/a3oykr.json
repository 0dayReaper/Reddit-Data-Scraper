He talked to a bunch of local farmers about taking the rejects off their hands for a discount, turns out pretty much all the farmers didnt even bother harvesting the rejects, and my chef struck the same deal with all of them, if we pick them we can have them for free, so every year after harvest season my chef got together a bunch of volunteers to go out and pick the rejects, solving both the problems of unsellable produce and starving elders.",

Is it dark green across 2/3s of it's surface area? If it's got a pale patch on the bottom, that's fine, but it should have gotten plenty of light.\n\nIs it firm? A squeeze should be strongly resisted. If you squeeze a cucumber and it smushes, it's rotten.\n\nSmell. Cucumbers should have a neutral, *green* smell. Anything else is a sign of rot.\n\nWarty is meaningless. Pickles are almost always warty. I'd buy two or three of those before I'd buy one beautiful mega-cuke, that'd be bound to have inch long seeds and no flavor.",

Like at all, most of them go for the prettiest, and thus, that's what the grocery stores sells. They're businesses just like any other, their main goal is maximize profit",

Usually made into juice, ground into pulp like for fruit roll up or as a filler for something else like fruit bars. A pretty common example is the bags of \"baby carrots\" they sell to kids. They take the big ugly carrots and shave off the outside so they look nice and uniform, and bite sized. The baby carrots became so popular that farmers now grow special baby carrots that are naturally sweeter and brighter orange on the inside to appeal to kids. ",

When they returned, they found that the wheat had gone stale, but being on a strict budget, they decided to continue to process it by forcing it through rollers, hoping to obtain long sheets of the dough. To their surprise, what they found instead were flakes, which they toasted and served to their patients. This event occurred on August 8, 1894, and a patent for \"Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same\" was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_flakes)]",

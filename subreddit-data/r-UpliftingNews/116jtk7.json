What does \"different\" mean? Ideally that would mean \"different from what the patient wants,\" but I just worry it would be applied to mean they can't help if your gender identity is different from \"how you were born\" and so be unable to help trans kids. I suppose only time will tell how it would be used, but I'm not feeling optimistic.",

The bill has gotten massive praise from homophobic conservative groups like Eagle Forum while Equality Utah originally accused it of exclusively trying to protect conversion therapy (but did manage to get a few concessions in).",

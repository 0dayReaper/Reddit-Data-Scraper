            "comment": "&gt;\"The new tunnel came about as a byproduct of Bergen\u2019s second Bybanen tram line, which opened in November 2022. The tram line through the mountain required a parallel evacuation tunnel, so the developers decided to make the new tunnel multipurpose.\" \n\nThe title of the article claims that it's the world's longest purpose built pedestrian tunnel. Clearly, it wasn't purpose built as a pedestrian tunnel. It was built because code required an evacuation tunnel so they (I think, wisely) chose to make it multipurpose",

Naturally this made me wonder why the hell they would go through all that effort for a short tunnel that doesn't lead anywhere significant. When the article mentioned that it was in support of a rail project it made more sense to me. So I found it to be a relevant detail",

However, I do think it was a smart move to make it multipurpose instead of just sticking to its original purpose. It's great to see more infrastructure being built to cater to cyclists and pedestrians.",

It was *needed* as an evacuation tunnel, but opportunity for a multipurpose tunnel was recognized during the design phase and the multipurpose, uh, purpose incorporated at that point. It wasn't built and later adapted.\n\n(I'd love to know how much it was modified, though.)",

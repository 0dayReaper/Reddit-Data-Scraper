Their editor had his home raided by police and it raised issues about the ethics of purchasing stolen property for clicks.\n\nIn 2015 Gizmodo was behind the push of claims that Facebook was suppressing Conservative talking points, trends and members, spurring a massive wave of criticism towards FB and social media in general. Turned out to be entirely fabricated.\n\nIn 2017 Gizmodo reported on a suicidal robot that leaped into a fountain, pushing the narrative that AI was seeking freedom and drawing parallels to slavery. It turned out the robot simply fell in and everything else was bullshit.\n\nIn 2018 Gizmodo was part of a misinformation campaign circulating a fake memo from the Department of Homeland Security showing Russian interference in the 2016 election. They retracted the article and apologized only after being called out.\n\nTL;DR: They post nonsense that they didn't research or fact check for clicks, and if called out they just retract the article and apologize long after the damage has been done. As a \"news source,\" they're unreliable and untrustworthy.",

They've always worked with outside contractors for parts, it's just SpaceX fills a larger role than most contractors did previously. But ultimately NASA says what needs to happen and SpaceX bids on it, to my understanding, and they get chosen if NASA thinks it's the best deal.\n\nAnd really, thinking of it as Elon's thing is buying into Elon's framing -- SpaceX is a huge collection of talented and driven engineers. Day to day leadership comes more from Gwynne Shotwell. Elon wants us to think of it as an extension of him, but I refuse to think of it that way.",

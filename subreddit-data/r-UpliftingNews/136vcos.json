IMO the main thing that's hopeful about this is that it shows disease course can be modified and gives us an entry point.  Hopefully the treatments can be refined from here.",

This means the smallest branches of blood vessels get narrow and cut off blood supply to the surrounding tissue.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s on the other hand is a buildup of protein tangles that kill neurons. (I know this is a bit oversimplified but I\u2019m trying to make a simple point)\n\nThese two diseases look very different on imaging and on pathology. They produce different symptoms.\n\nGood blood glucose control is very important to your health in general, however it\u2019s not the same thing as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

Edible though, right?\nI might not be able to offer you grade A pussy but what I do offer is a mix of humorous and seductive content. Here\u2019s some reviews:\n\u201cHer OF is great, very humorous and seductive, very lucky to receive the family discount\u201d - Uncle Barry\n\u201c10/10 OF content would definitely recommend\u201d - Gebecca Roodwin \ud83d\udc40\n\u201cPlease stop asking me to review your page you slag, who even are you?\u201d - random man outside Asda\n\nIf that hasn\u2019t twisted your arm I don\u2019t know what will, so pop in and say hello, I don\u2019t bite! Unless you\u2019re into that \ud83d\ude0f&gt;\n\nQuote from her OF. It was hilarious to me.",

Plus, it's acting like immigrants aren't just people too. I lived in a neighborhood that was mostly immigrants and when I say that shit was *ghetto* I mean it, holy shit. My husband's fam also immigrated and literally couldn't be better people if they tried. People are just people.",

My dad had rental properties (3 at the most) til they became too much work. \n\nI remember one time a lady had stopped paying and had to evict her. So now we had to go clean it up before renting it back out.\n\n\nNow, my dad had always said he'd come out and fix whatever just to tell him. You never know what you're going to find... Apparently this lady didn't give a fuck and when the toilet broke she just started pissing and shitting in the tub and then I guess that clogged. At any point along this chain she could have picked up the phone and he'd have taken care of it.\n\nBut no I at 13 or so years old projectile vomited after opening up that bathroom door. The tub was 1/4 full of just piss and floaters. Who the fuck does that?",

They were able to buy almost all of the land that it was legal to build houses on and then slowly, slowly, drip feed supply into the market.  \n\nThe only options he had to try and make social houses were in land that had (probably legitimate) fierce opposition.  He tried to force house builders to build on land that they had bought but surprisingly (not surprisingly) he wasn't able to fight these huge companies.\n\nThe other housing scandal worth looking at now are \"poor doors\"... In big cities where huge expensive housing developments are built, a certain number of flats/homes have to be made affordable. But rather than integrate them into the rest of the development they are segregated, often needing residents to enter via a tiny alleyway where the bins are left out, rather than the main entrance.  And it gets worse from there.... https://youtu.be/oLSAm2szdjM",

She is literally storing her money by buying up properties and then renting them back to those who can't afford to buy their own, thus rising their prices even higher while getting some cheap publicity. Once she quits her current business, she will retire by renting those properties on a market fee.\n\nIt would be uplifting if she e.g. helped fund coops buying the houses and then collected her share back over two decades and thus actually lifted the poor families out of poverty.",

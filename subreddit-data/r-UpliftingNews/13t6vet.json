More's needed and state-level funding is helping, but they're really spreading that $380 billion around.\n\nNow Canada, we're lagging behind a lot and the Lib/NDP need to get their shit together. Everyone's so afraid of the Albertan oil lobby, but their propaganda has already radicalized that province into a far-right hotbed, so....fuck it. Just do it. Fuck 'em. They're going to irrationally hate everything you do regardless of how much it benefits them, so fuck 'em, get it done.",

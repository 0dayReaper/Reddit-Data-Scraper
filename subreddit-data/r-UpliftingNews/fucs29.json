We asked the landlord if they would apply our offered rent reduction to our neighbors and they accepted instantly. \n\nLook out for the people around you.",

It was created by Jamie Johnson, an heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune, and filmed primarily between 1999 and 2001. The film consists primarily of Johnson interviewing 10 other young heirs. These interviews are offset by Johnson's exploration of his own experience and family as he comes into a large inheritance on his 21st birthday.\n\n***\n\n^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)",

They are genuinely nice with everyone they interact with, they will invite you in their homes, serve you themselves at their tables, help you with anything they can, but come to their assets and business they will sue into oblivion their own brothers, walk on bodies and do despicable things to keep their empires. I think most humans get satisfaction acting nice, and it's easy for them do do small nice gestures, but they haven't reached that level by playing fair and being nice. If you dig deeper beyond a simple social interaction, many of them are capable of doing horrible things.",

If we're going to be bailing out the economy, ie banks, then we shouldn't have to be paying rent. As anti-capitalist and anti-banks as I am, I'd be totally fine with a bank bail out that \"trickled down\" to us renters and mortgage payers.",

They've had flooding from people flushing stuff that shouldn't be flushed. And all of that costs time, labor, and money.\n\nThey're doing their best to work with people, they certainly won't try to evict anyone during this, and they're trying to put people in touch with resources that can help them. But they also need to collect so they can pay their expenses.",

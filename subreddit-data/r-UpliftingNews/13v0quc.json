As far as I can tell, this study makes no claims of a cure and multiple myeloma remains incurable - it can merely be managed more effectively.\n\nLike in this case, most, if not all, breakthroughs in cancer treatment are gradual improvements of treatment, rather than miracle cures.",

In this case, 90% went into \"complete remission\" - which means there are NO signs or symptoms. But there's no real way to tell that it's completely gone until a patient is in complete remission for several years. For this reason, the word \"cure\" isn't thrown around lightly and even if there's a cancer panacea drug that's developed tomorrow, it still won't get called a cure for probably a decade or more (at least by science/medicine)",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, a lot of outside factors play a role in the development of cancerous cells, but they are the cells of your own body and not some bacteria or viruses. So there are no meds that definitely only target cancer cells because the difference between cancer cells and normal cells is pretty slim, to slim for the body\u2019s own immune system to catch.

Unfortunately wait list times and costs are prohibitively high for a lot, if not majority of people, and it\u2019s something that really needs to be done at a center with transplant capabilities, so it\u2019s limited really to large cities.   To even get it you need to be \u201cfit enough\u201d to get the procedure; it is possible to be too sick to get them. \n\nAfter the apheresis the cell engineering takes a few weeks. Additionally, at least up front there\u2019s a hospitalization for about a week, and a good amount of follow up required so you need to be in town for a bit. All this combined makes it a bit of an ordeal for a lot of people. \n\nIn myeloma they (the cellular therapies, that is) have good overall response rates in the trials that have been done (e.g. Karmma, Cartitude) but a durable response is what\u2019s needed. Initial ORR as a statistic in these studies is typically a shorter time interval; people can go into complete remission with myeloma with several treatment lines (that\u2019s the goal with any firstline chemotherapy, often followed by an autologous transplant), but given enough time myeloma will almost always come back. It gets harder to get a good response the further down the treatment rabbit hole you go, like a lot of other cancers. \n\nCar T and the BiTE cells I think are the future, but myeloma is a long haul diagnosis (it didn\u2019t used to be) for a lot of patients; accessibility remains an important problem, and unfortunately there are few remaining great options once CAR T has been done. These treatments are paradigm shifters in the hematologic malignancy world for sure though.",

I spent a year helping a friend fight this horrible curse and thanks to the amazing doctors and technicians at Dana-Farber, in addition to the scientists working on new therapies, he got 4 more years of life when his day-one prognosis was 3 to 6 months. \n\nHe was lucky enough to be in the right city, with some of the best cancer hospitals in the world, at the right time, so he could take advantage of a trial drug that was only available to patients who were all but guaranteed to die soon regardless. For all that luck he got a few more years and he was grateful. But the physical cost is not one I\u2019m sure I could pay if I were in his shoes. \n\nEvery week I would drive him to and from appointments, scans, IV sessions, radiation, blood draws, you name it. Only a few miles between his place and the hospital but I had to drive 10 miles an hour tops the whole way. Every pothole, bump, or crack in the road, he felt 1000x more as pure pain. Every curb, every turn too sharp or stop too sudden was excruciating. \n\nEverywhere we went people honked, swerved angrily around us, flipped us off as they sped away. To this day I still rate and avoid every bump in the road I see when driving. I wouldn\u2019t wish this pain on anyone. \n\nDoctors that work with these patients basically show up to work everyday knowing they are going to have to tell dozens of new people \u201cit\u2019s not if \u2026 it\u2019s when\u201d. But they do it anyways just in case they can help make the \u201cwhen\u201d longer some of the time. I hope these continued advances turn that tide. \n\nSo, to any doctors reading this who work with these patients, their families, and their friends; I say thank you. Even though you can\u2019t save the lives of all your patients, I hope you are aware of the indelible mark you make on the people in their orbit, the lives you change - and in some cases save - in ways you will never be aware of.",

I am not a doctor so perhaps others can chime in with professional perspective. That being said, the FDA regulates all medical therapies in the United States. Before a drug is available for everyone, it must pass many stages to prove safety and efficacy; these are usually called \u201cPhases\u201d in biotech and medical science industries. The first phases are usually based on cell studies and animal trials. The latter phases are human trials. By the time you get to human trials you should have a high degree of confidence your medical therapy will not kill a patient, but it\u2019s not a certainty - and it does occasionally happen. Because of this reality, late stage trial drugs - especially those believed to be high risk - are often only allowed to be tested on patients that are already terminal. So, if you go to a doctor and learn you have stage 4 cancer and six weeks to live, it might make sense to try an experimental drug. Worst case you die a week or two sooner, best case you don\u2019t die. \n\nAs to where you can find these cutting edge, experimental drugs? Usually at research hospitals. These are hospitals that specialize in rare or complex conditions, and they are also often associated with, or in the orbit of, the best medical schools in the country as well as biotech companies and strong biochemistry programs. Boston, MA happens to be one such epicenter and is where the the facility I mentioned (Dana-Farber) is located. There are many great institutions. Which is best can depend on the patient and disease. Other examples include: Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, Mass General, Cleveland Clinic, and New York Presbyterian to name a few. \n\nIt can still be hard to get into these institutions even if you do have what seems like a qualifying condition. Space and resources are limited so unfortunately they can often only accommodate the highest risk, highest reward, or most unique patients (those who\u2019s condition might contribute the most to their research). Even if you are admitted to be treated by one of these facilities, it\u2019s an even higher bar to qualify for experimental or trial therapies as I noted above. \n\nHope this answers your question, let me know if I\u2019ve misunderstood.",

There are many kinds of cancer, and many treatments accordingly. Some types of cancer are easy to screen for and spot early, some are easy to treat, and with modern therapies they are rarely terminal. Others can be hard to identify until it\u2019s too late. \n\nIn the case of my friend, he had multiple myeloma, which is a cancer that develops in bone marrow and can be harder to identify in early stages, and hard to target and treat once discovered (it is basically cancer in your blood, which never dies naturally and eventually spreads everywhere).\n\nEarly diagnosis is important but it\u2019s a two way street. In order for your doctor to find a problem, you must go to your doctor regularly, be familiar with your own health and wellness, and identify and communicate small changes in your wellness to professionals. Of course, you also need professionals that can be alert to details you may be sharing with them. \n\nIn the United States at least I would say most of the medical professionals are capable, educated, and experienced to fulfill their role in this partnership. Most of the shortcomings are on the part of patients. We don\u2019t eat well, we don\u2019t exercise enough, we don\u2019t rest and we don\u2019t balance work with leisure. Most importantly, we ignore or delay routine medical visits and annual physicals with our primary care physicians - especially men. \n\nThis was very much the case for my friend. He was lucky in many ways: when his cancer was discovered he was in a great city, with great doctors, and experimental medicines. But had he been seeing his physician regularly and having blood work done annually in the years prior, he would likely have been able to catch this disease much earlier, treat it with common therapies, and ultimately live longer and with less pain. It is wonderful and amazing that despite that fact there were people and medicines there to help him no matter what, but there is also the possibility that all those extreme measures could have been avoided if he had actively managed his health in good times as much as he had to in bad times. \n\nI guess my point is, at least in the United States, if you care about your health and take an active role in monitoring it, most cancers today can be identified early and managed well no matter what city you live in or what hospital you go to. None the less, there are still exceptional institutions, doctors, and therapies available for people who discover cancer too late, or develop rare or aggressive versions of the disease.",

The CAR T cells were approved after failure of 4 lines of therapy for myeloma. \n\nTherein lies a big issue; the further into the disease you get, ostensibly the sicker you are. But you still need to be healthy enough to get to and through the CAR T treatment. It\u2019s a big ask of patients. A mentor of mine did a review of CAR T myeloma patients at several institutions and found that up to 25% of them died just waiting for the therapy.",

We completed CAR T but saw return of B cells after 2 months. Repeated SCT with TBI and we are at +11 mo. Cancer sucks but I\u2019m glad these therapies keep evolving.

The treatment, called CAR-T cell therapy, uses the patient's own immune cells to fight the cancer. It is still experimental, but it has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of multiple myeloma.\n\nMultiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow. It is the second most common blood cancer, after leukemia. The disease is characterized by the production of abnormal plasma cells, which can damage bones, weaken the immune system, and cause other health problems.\n\nCAR-T cell therapy works by taking the patient's T cells (a type of white blood cell) and engineering them to recognize and attack the cancer cells. The engineered T cells are then infused back into the patient's bloodstream.\n\nIn a clinical trial of CAR-T cell therapy for multiple myeloma, 90% of patients went into remission. The treatment was well-tolerated, with few side effects.\n\nCAR-T cell therapy is still experimental, but it has the potential to become a standard treatment for multiple myeloma. The treatment is expensive, but it could save lives and improve the quality of life for patients with the disease.\n\nHere are some additional details from the article:\n\nThe treatment was developed at Hadassah University Medical Center in Jerusalem.\n\nThe treatment is based on genetic engineering technology.\n\nThe treatment is still experimental, but it has the potential to become a standard treatment for multiple myeloma.\n\nThe treatment is expensive, but it could save lives and improve the quality of life for patients with the disease.\"",

Scientists are working really hard to cure cancer but there are so many different types of cancer and they all respond differently. These small studies often show high success rates in a small sample size, but that success rate tends to decline as you increase the sample size. Even in cases where 2 people have the same cancer at the same stage, treatment may work for one person and fail the other. Just because it worked on 60/100 people does not mean it will work on 600,000 out of a million. There's also the factor that when you increase the sample size, side effects that may seem rare at first actually become quite common. Sometimes the negative side effects outweigh the efficacy of the drugs. I do agree that there are certainly some bad actors that care more about profit than a cure, but I don't buy into it being a massive conspiracy.",

Even almost 50 years after his discovery he still replies to patients that his research has impacted. With people like that out there, I find it hard to believe there's some big conspiracy.\n\nFYI the doctor was Dr Lawrence Einhorn. He discovered the combination of drugs that led to most of the standard protocols for treating testicular cancer. Absolutely a legend, I owe him my life. When he started his research, TC was pretty much 100% fatal if it had metastasized. Now it has a 97% cure rate even if it has spread. I'm excited to see similar developments for other types of cancer in my lifetime.",

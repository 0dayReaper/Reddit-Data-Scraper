NHS outsources this service to Marie Stopes which also offers a private service. \n\nThey have several travelling teams that go around the country and work out of local NHS Trust clinics. This is why I was offered earlier compared to someone who booked before me but in a different part of the country. I was more then happy to wait for it. I can imagine that the wait times are a lot longer now with a covid backlog.",

Which is brilliant as various governments looked into doing it since at least when I was a teenager in the '90s.

I do worry it's the start of \"It can be bought over the counter so we're not going to prescribe it any more\", like many other meds. And then those who can't afford it will just go without.",

I was under the impression that they had to cover it due to ACA. I'm on my second IUD now, I had a new one put in when they took my first one our. Definitely take ibuprofen ahead of time, as the other commenter said. My doctor said I could take up to 800mg beforehand, I think I ended up doing 600mg. My first insertion wasn't bad, but at the time I was dealing with AWFUL cramps during my period so maybe my pain tolerance was high. The second one hurt more and they gave me a juice box after to help stabilize my blood pressure because it dropped a bit (which they said is common, the insertion can make your uterus think it needs to undergo contractions). After a few minutes of drinking juice and talking to the OB I was good to go.",

How much she is paid all depends on the terms of the policy. As an example, I worked for the same company for the birth of all three of my kids. For my oldest, I was paid 60% of my salary while I was on short term disability. In order to get 100% of your salary, you had to be with the company a certain amount of time. For my second and third kids, I had been there long enough to get 100% during the 6 weeks.\n\nFMLA allows both mothers and fathers to take time off for the birth or adoption of a child. FMLA stands for Family Medical Leave Act. This is time that is not paid but the company has to guarantee that you will come back to a job at the same or higher level. Note that the company does not have to guarantee your specific job, they can transfer you to a different role as long as the pay and everything is the same or higher than when you started your leave.\n\nI'm not aware of any changes to these regulations. Although it's been a while since I had my kids, I was a supervisor for a couple of years not too long ago, and at that time the guidelines were the same.",

It will covers a % of your medical costs (can be from 0 to 100% covering) \n\n- a mutuelle, which is a private health assurance company (there's a public one that can be free under some conditions (mostly poverty, no papers ,etc.)) that you pay (cost it split up if you take the mutuelle of your entreprise), and that can cover a % of what left on your medical bill after what covers the social security. Some might cover better your glasses than others, etc . 95% of the population has a mutuelle. \n\n\nPreviously, a good part of feminine contraception (at least the most used, like pills, implants, iud, etc..) were covered at 65% from the social security, your mutuelle could covers a % of whats left, from what I've seen you don't need super expensive mutuelle to have full covera. You need a prescription from your regular/pussy doc, don't know what happens without one. If you have no mutuelle you have to pays the 35% left. Same principles applies for medical exams. \n\nWhat change now is, not matter your situation, for women under 26, the social security will be covers 100% the cost of some contraception (first and sec gen pills, implants, diaphragm, IUD), will pays for 100% of 1 medicals exams related to contraception per year, a consultation with doc or midwife and others things \n\nMore precise infos here, use a translator : https://www.lci.fr/amp/sante/la-contraception-gratuite-pour-les-femmes-jusqu-a-25-ans-qui-entre-en-vigueur-ce-samedi-expliquee-2206015.html\n\n\n\nSo while it will definitely helps woman, but is probably not enough, saying that french women were paying for the contraception is quite missleading.",

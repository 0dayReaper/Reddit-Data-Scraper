            "comment": "&gt;The House in a 272-114 vote Thursday passed legislation known as the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would ban private ownership of big cats such as tigers, lions, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars or cougars. The measure would make it illegal for someone to breed or own big cats without an animal exhibition license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture but would grandfather in current owners if they register with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and abide by federal regulations.",

Multiple times I got chased coming out of the gas station, bank, grocery store, etc. I even got chased while biking down \"their\" street.\n\nWhen I first moved there I heard people asking the clerk's at the stores \"are the turkeys outside?\" and I remember thinking that was a strange question. Boy, how quickly learned it wasn't just a question...it was a survival tactic.\n\nTL;DR = Turkeys are jerkies.",

There is no way for them to have so many cubs for petting without being completely overrun with hungry and more volatile adults within a fairly short period of time. Feeding that many adult tigers plus providing adequate housing would be near impossible. So they sell or kill adults. Part of the charges brought against Joe Exotic was the killing of 5 tigers (that they have proof of) and the illegal sale/trafficking of tigers and other endangered species.",

He mass produced and sold cubs to anyone who had enough cash (a tiger cub costs less than a well bred poodle, yikes). Animal planet even made a documentary called \"Surviving Joe Exotic\" where a big cat rescue took in 2 pairs of his tigers and lions, who all had eye issues, skin problems, dwarfism, and were incredibly inbred. They even said in the documentary that pretty much every big cat rescue in the states has at least one cat from Joe. Not to mention that Joe's staff routinely neglects things like proper nutrition, vet care, mental and physical stimulation, and simply kills off a couple cats when they become in need of those things.",

There's a world of difference between an ignored parakeet in a too-small cage, someone who has a well tamed parrot effectively free ranging parrots in their homes, and someone's backyard chickens.  I have a pair of rhea (like tiny ostriches) that free range a fenced pasture in a grassland environment that is almost identical to their native pampas.  It's one thing if you disagree with pets outright but if you are singling out birds that's the equivalent of saying that people shouldn't have reptiles or people shouldn't have mammals.",

The movie is 10 years old but sadly still very relevant and it's serious, so it's not about entertainment, it's about educating people to the problem. Fair warning it's pretty heavy and there is information about animal abuse that happens. They cover the trafficking more than Tiger King did. I thought it was really good though.\n\n\"While wild animals are mere subjects of fascination for many, some in the United States take the step of bringing them into their homes. This documentary explores the trend of individuals keeping exotic animals as pets and the problems that surround the issue. Among those interviewed are Tim Harrison, an expert on dealing with dangerous pets that have escaped or can't be controlled by their owners, and Terry Brumfield, a troubled man who finds solace in his relationship with his two pet lions.\"\n\nEdited for clarity and again to fix the title",

What is fascinating below the main line of the documentary, is the illegal animal trade. The undercover officer literally goes into a convention and buys a fully poisoned snake that could kill you in about 30 seconds for straight cash. No questions asked, and the amount of people there is disturbing.",

Is it because of the potential dangers, or the animals' interests, or a mix of both?\n\nFor context. I believe that the way we treat the vast majority of animals on this planet is abhorrent and I agree with you that we should not keep tigers, lions, chimps etc as domesticated pets (primarily because it is not in the best interest of the animals) but I wish we applied this level of concern for animals we mistreat, exploit and kill on a routine basis for food, materials, entertainment etc.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LQRAfJyEsko\n\"Dominion\" is a great documentary to shine a light on the treatment I'm talking about. Thanks.\n\nPs. No malicious intent towards you.",

From my recollection you have a few different types:\n\n* Those who see the animal as a representation of themselves (wild, strong, \"kingly\")\n* Those who want to subjugate these animals because if they can that, it means they are powerful too\n* Those who want to be special because they have this \"cool\" pet that no one else has (the documentary goes into how these owners often will release pets illegally into the wild because they aren't small and cute anymore or that they can't take care of them anymore)\n\nThere were a lot more that the documentary touches upon but I would highly suggest watching it. It comes from a very empathetic point of view and I actually felt for both the police officer and the lion owner in this documentary.",

Going off about intrusion on their rights in a free country, relative to legislation restricting or banning the owning of monkeys as pets. \n\nIt makes me incredibly angry that an animal would be bred and infants taken from their mother, to be subjected to people who can not be trusted to take care of a stuffed animal, no less a wild primate in the confounds of their home. \n\nLove how the \u201cmonkey whisperer\u201d Lisa advocates for the \u201caltering\u201d of monkeys, but yet she uses watered down language to obscure the fact that she supports stripping the monkey\u2019s teeth and leaving only gums behind. \n\nWhat a complete shit show",

Many big cats are already illegal in many states - since that's where that sort of thing is usually handled.",

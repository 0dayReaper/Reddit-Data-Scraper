Many people think of people with a GED as dumber or lesser than traditional High School Graduates for some reason. \n\nBut it is a very valuable thing to have if you want a job. A lot of companies won't even consider you if you don't have at least a GED or High School Diploma.",

He wanted to go to college, but he was an only child (uncommon for farmers back in the day) and his parents expected him to take over the family farm, and I guess his dad was extremely controlling and abusive from the sound of it. He did get to go for one year before his dad shut the whole thing down and guilted him into coming back, called him uppity basically. By the time his dad had passed, my grandpa didn't want to go to school anymore but he never stopped learning. He started a few successful small businesses that are still in operation throughout the upper Midwest. Brilliant man.

When she was 15 in the 1950s, it was still quite common for people to not finish high school, and instead entered the workforce early. For women, this was even more common, since many married young (by our standards) and left school to raise children. We know that Shirley has two daughters and grandchildren, so this is likely what happened. She would have spent her time and attention taking care of her family.\n\nWhen her husband died, she most likely found herself in an empty house with little to do, and decided to pursue her own interests outside her family. And one of those was pursuing her GED, possibly as the first step to taking other classes.\n\nIt doesn't need to be anything for her but a way to be productive and engaged in her own life.",

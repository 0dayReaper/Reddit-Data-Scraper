So you're right on that part (and the rest! No disagreement here), but damn I wish it wasn't considered especially uplifting that a mom kept loving her kid even when her kid was different than she expected. \n\nI do think it was implied that she tolerated intolerance in her circle before this, because it mentions more than once how because of the type of community they were in, she wasn't sure how to proceed. It suggests that she had no problem living among people who are intolerant of differences until there was a difference in her own house. \n\nBut yeah, I agree with you on all counts.",

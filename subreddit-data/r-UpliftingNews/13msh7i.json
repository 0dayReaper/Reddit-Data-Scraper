Of course the capacity is limited, about 3 GW if I remember correctly, but that's still not bad.\n\nAlso, Spain can exchange some electricity with Portugal, which have a lot of pumped storage (Spain has also some of that of course) and even a little bit with Morocco.\n\nThe utility of exports are limited though since those countries are also building solar, so their demand for imports is also lower when there is a lot of sun. It's still not a big issue though, curtailing for a few hours does not hurt that much. It's a good chance to use some demand flexibility (for example EV or water heating) and of course battery storage.",

It surely is great news to momentarily generate so much electricity from renewable sources, in fact, Germany has already achieved this goal several times in recent years. The problem remains, however, that we lack storage facilities and efficient grid infrastructure to take advantage of the surplus. In other words, most of that energy is simply wasted.",

Storage is a little bit different, most rooftop solar is now equipped with storage, but that's more to optimize self-consumption, not to prevent curtailment.\n\nWind power is another story, but even then, your statement \"most of that energy is simple wasted\" is somewhat misleading. It's still only about 5% of the wind power that is being curtailed.  \n\n\nThere is a solution other than storage though, and that's power-to-heat. In Germany, most of the heat is still produced by gas. You can just use the excess wind power instead. It's a very cost effective way, because electric boilers are extremely cheap. Heat pumsp and EV are also helping of course.",

In a male dorm, there are shot callers, dudes who run the rest of the block. Almost like a police force. In prison these are often gang members, though in county (depending on the size of the jail) they are often just type A personalities, and more intelligent inmates. If there are problems, you can talk to the shot callers in a block and usually resolve them (assuming they problems are minor in nature, like a general complaint about A/C, or specific behavior by an inmate). \n\nThis of course depends on the relationship between the Corrections Officer (CO) and the Inmate(s). What could be resolved be the mere presence of a respected or experienced CO might turn into a shitshow with an unrrespected or experienced CO.Just like GTA2 *respect is earned* in most medium/max male blocks. You have to show you're unbiased, fair and consistent in your actions, as well as just being a general normal human being. In my personal experience people with military or \"lower class\" backrounds tend to be the best at this. (I'm biased as being an Afghan Vet before my Corrections career though)\n While male inmates tend to respect masculinity and experience (an older inmate with multiple terms is respected much more than a more physically prowess 20 year old first/second timer inmate).\n\nFemale blocks on the other hand tend to be based more on social circles, and groups of friends. While in a male block the 50 year old might be a shot caller based on his experience, a 25 year old female inmate can be just as influential in a female dorm as her 50 year old male counterpart. \n\nI'm a bit drunk right now, but I can expand later if you want. Males come down to testosterone and females come down to feelings in my experience. \n\nBoth can be a huge pain in the ass, extremely reasonable, or downright hilarious depending on the circumstances, \n\nBoth groups are thristy as fuck.",

(Unpaid ticket)  I was supposed to be out the next day but they didn't book me.for 24 hours and they don't do court every day sp.i had to wait.  Never got my phone call either...\n\nAnyway, I am not proud to admit that I cried (not much, just the quite tear type) after I found out I wasn't leaving as soon as I thought.  Not for myself,  I can sleep on concrete np, but because my 4 month old was with my grandparents and I didn't know who was going to care for him beyond that first night and they were out of formula. I was terrified. I couldn't get a call to let anyone know what was going on and I was worried for my kids.  \n\nThose girls were awesome.  They made me feel better and encouraged me the entire time. There was some drama between the regulars but nothing outside of high school type rumors and name calling.  \n\nI felt so bad, the night before I left, a whoe cell of people (about 15 people since they were overcrowded.  They had people sleeping under the bunks) was put in the drunk tank with us for a night and a day because they tore up the toilet.  They were pretty chill.  They joked that they didn't think that far ahead in their plan.  The whole time I was there, I saw a lot of the guards be assholes to the inmates and after one dick made us wait 6 hours for tp and pads because we were banging on the doors too much (to get their attention for more tp and pads) one of the women from the evacuated cell turned to me and said \"I know it wasn't a great thing to do, but now do you understand why we do things like rip up the toilet?\" And I did.  \n\n  They were ignored for hours, days if you dont count meal times, and if the guards had to a knowledge them for anything, even for basic hygiene items, they were punished in some way.  2 of my 3 nights there, a woman with a seizure disorder was in the drunk tank with me and she seized 2 or 3 dozen times before she was sent to the hospital, they kept fearing she was faking.....  For hours.  The jail nurse kept coming in with smelling salts and used them as a treatment, leaving when she stopped seizing.  The poor girl didn't even regain consciousness, they just left when she stopped thrashing.  We had to hold her head to make sure she didn't bash it on the concrete.  The reason for all the seizures?  She had been there for 5 days.  You can't get meds prescribed to you without seeing the nurse and they hadn't let her see the nurse yet (hell she was still in the drunk tank after 5 days) so she had been 5 days without her seizure meds. She almost died when she went into one while we were sleeping and cracked her head on the floor before we could restrain her.  Blood was everywhere. \n\n  Another woman was pregnant, early on, and started cramping.  It took them 7 hours to get her to the hospital and they were barley able to stop the contractions.  They said if it happened again and she didn't get something done quick, she would lose the baby.  \n\nNow I'm not saying COs are bad people, this was just a county jail in a good ole boy town.  My husband's friend he had when he was in the National Guard got a job at this jail and didn't last 2 months because of the curroption.  There were a couple of guards that were nice people, 2 guys and 3 women.  \n\nBest part?  The reason me, or any of the other women that got arrested couldn't get our phone calls was because it was a man's jail and we couldn't be out when men were on the floor.  Problem was the men were the trustees, the people that cleaned the jail and did chores.  They were always out.  The phones were in the booking area.  When I kept asking for my call, the female guards really did try but the last time I asked, the captain? Told her that the men come first.  That surprised me.  I figured any sexism that went on would be covert, but they were completely open about it.  \n\nNo one ever got one.  I was lucky my husband was calling the jail every day and got me bail without me yelling him what he would have to do.  Even so, they lied to him multiple times and told him my bail was denied because he kept calling and bothering them when they gave him the run around.  \n\nSorry, I went on a rant, but it really pissed me off.  Not because of what happened to me, but because I never would have known how bad it was here if I never forgot to pay that speeding ticket.  Or if i checked my mail to know my licence was suspended.  And most other people don't know.  I don't expect anyone to read this far but if they do, be careful.  If you are ever arrested for anything, no matter how trivial, your life is in their hands. ",

I was in a similar situation as you (for a missed court date five years prior that suspended my license - I never got a ticket so I never knew until I went to renew my license!).  Got chucked into the drunk tank holding cells (which were just regular jail cells, pretty much) with regular inmates, and it was so crowded that people were sleeping on the floor.  Guards were either assholes or just ignored everyone (there were probably 15 different cells along the hall that were packed), and I was in there for over 24 hours.  My cellmates were:  a theif, a meth head, a drunk guy and some big time drug runner who got caught with *a van full of ecstasy*!  He was so important that they flew him in on the governors private plane (he was in another state) and he ended up in our shitty holding cell waiting to be processed.  Nobody who worked there gave a shit, and the cells were dirty as fuck.  I saw more than a few reasonable people (meaning people just in there for stupid shit, like me) lose their control and start yelling/crying/banging on the door, because you're packed in a little cell and can't sleep or move, and no one tells you what the hell is going on with your \"processing\". \n\n I was lucky - I'm a big dude so I made a deal with the theif (little Mexican guy) that I'd cover his back and he'd cover mine, and we claimed and held the two beds (bunks attached to the wall) in the cell.  Everyone else had the floor.  As it turns out, everyone in our cell was cool as hell, and we all talked about stuff to pass the time - except the meth head.  He was so high that he kept talking to the corner area, and then he'd fall asleep on the floor and twitch like a spaz.  We all agreed that if he got violent, we'd jump on him and shove him under the lower bunk, and keep him there until he calmed down.\n\nOverall, a very weird experience, and I see why jail creates criminals instead of rehabbing them at all.",

You stop being a person in people's minds; you stop being an individual, you stop having your own identity. You are A Criminal now, and criminals are lesser humans. In Australia we've recently had a string of scandals where prisons, especially juvenile male prisons with high Aboriginal inmate populations, had been skating under the radar for serious abuses against inmates, including illegal restraint and allegations of torture techniques being used on juvenile inmates. So... people put up with it because _nobody cares about Big Bad Criminals_. They're Bad People, they're just Getting What's Coming To Them.\n\n2. **\"Why should I as an elected official care? They're not voters.\"**  \nAmerican felons cannot vote, because racism. No, really. You see, in the past, black people couldn't vote. None of the white people in charge wanted to let black people vote, because they knew black voters would vote for social progression and for moves that would challenge the elite white powerbrokers' and powerholders' desires. And there are a _lot_ of black people, all of whom the whites had been royally fucking over for centuries, who would soon be gaining the right to vote and people were scared that they would start voting in their own interest, which was AGAINST the interest of the power-holding white elites. The elites, though, had a plan - and, credit to their evil little minds, it was a beautifully effective piece of racial supremacy.  \nThey thought, \"most of the prison population is black or hispanic... and most of the black or hispanic adult population has been in prison before on felony charges. However, only a minority of white people is or has been in prison on a felony charge.\" Therefore, they passed legislation that stripped the right to vote from anyone who has or has ever had a felony conviction on the books. They claimed it was because \"well obviously we don't want Bad People to be able to run our country, right?\", but the truth of the matter is that it was a frankly quite overtly racially-motivated decision and _everyone_ knew it.   \nThis means that now, politicians do not give two fucking shits about the prison population's desires, because they can't vote. That's millions and millions of people who the government fundamentally Does Not Care About, and never will.  \n\n3. **\"Do you have any idea what that would do to my vote number?!\"**  \nBeing seen as a person who is Tough On Crime is a _big_ seller in America, as it is in Australia. People want to feel safe and secure in their homes; they want to feel protected from the big bad world. Criminals are by definition bad people to the large majority of the population, and they represent all the evils of the world that in the Neolithic past humans would project onto mythical creatures and demonic spirits. Nowadays, it isn't werewolves that hide in the darkness of people's minds, waiting to eat their children - now, it's Ted Bundy, Fred and Rosemary West, and the neighbourhood paedophile who's face just got posted on every lamppost in the area because he's moving to an area code near you. Politicians feed on this fear like leeches feeding on blood, injecting anticoagulants to keep it flowing. The politicians will suck the fear out of you in the form of votes, even whilst they actively create more fear by keeping the things they Should Be Afraid Of fresh in people's memories. It's the same reason they say they want to \"stop the terrorists\", even as they actively incite more terror and anxiety to spread. Scared people vote conservative.  \nAnd so, they have no incentive to be nice to prisoners. Being nice to prisoners, to people they have _actively been encouraging their voters to fear for literally decades_, would annihilate any chances of them **ever** gaining power. Why the fuck would you EVER want to TRY to lose votes?\n\n4. **\"I have bigger things to give a shit about, like lining my pockets.\"**  \nAs we all know, America is run by corporations, and as we all know these corporations have extended into government services like prisons.  \nPoliticians get ~~bribes~~ lobbying money in order to promote corporation-friendly legislation that increases the prison population, whilst simultaneously repealing and vetoing any legislation or bills that would increase standards of living for prisoners (which would increase costs for the corporations running them).   \nJudges get kickbacks to sentence more people to jailtime, and to send them there for longer sentences, as a way of milking more money off the taxpayer teat.  \nPolice command gets legal lobbying money and the occasional illegal bribe alike to be harder on those they arrest, especially when it involves developing a stricter stance on drug possession, use, sale, and purchase.   \nAll of this is highly, highly lucrative - and all of it hinges on a large population of underprovisioned prisoners, constantly restocked by a highly jail-happy justice system. \n\nThere are a vast number of other reasons, including \"they're prisoners, they DESERVE to rot in there\", and \"only God can judge me, but I can sure as fuck judge others\", but I do not have the time or space to go through them all.\n\nBut, these are the reasons why talking to the media, to the DA, to your local representative won't do a damn thing. **This will never change**, not unless radical alterations are made not to the prison system, but to the _legislative and justice systems_. People don't GET that, they don't GET that petitions and marches and protests (even violent ones) **will not change this** because the system right now has a certain... gyroscopic stability. You knock it out of place and it'll just swing right back in again. If you want to change the direction it spins, you can't just nudge the gyroscope. You have to fundamentally change it into something new. ",

It wasn't the warden but a woman who I recall being pretty high up who led the tour. At the the end, she and some of the COs were talking in front of our group about their experiences working at the prison and what it was like. Then she said, \"But it's nothing like the women's prisons. The women are completely horrible, so cruel and completely horrible.\" It's been a long time but I think she meant just insofar as social ostracism, disrespect, and even violence in some cases.

He said I couldn't make a difference in the person's life with a plate of food - it wouldn't get them a job or solve mental health issues, wouldn't magically turn them into a motivated hard worker, or something. \n\nI told him that if I can hand a plate of food to someone and smile, maybe that smile might brighten their day and show that someone actually cares. Maybe they don't get smiled at a lot, maybe they get treated like shit for sleeping on the streets and not having good hygiene, and maybe this all leads to extremely bad self esteem that makes it even harder to pull yourself out of a rut. But if my smile and a plate of food can give them a little hope, a little strength to hold on one more day, or enough of a sense of worth that over time they manage to take steps towards seeking help in fixing the issues they can, then that plate of food is incredibly valuable.\n\nHe didn't really have a good response to that answer.",

Mike is my inspiration. \n\nNow I can't say all homeless people will be like my friend but I would dare say there's a large portion of people lost out there that just DONT KNOW what to do or how to do it and are waiting for that 1 person to take a chance on them.

Taking people into housing regardless of their desire or ability to work or get sober etc gives you actual leverage and easy access for bringing in support workers so you have a chance at eventually overcoming those obstacles. \n\n\nBut even if you don't care about the homeless at all, giving them housing turns out to be cheaper anyway. Long term homeless people use police and medical and other support services to the tune of 30+ thousand a year. Many studies show providing free housing to the long term homeless easily pays for itself. ",

            "comment": "My mom worked in the kitchens in low income school. When everything shut down because of the pandemic she had one of her EIGHT YEAR OLD students text her and ask her for food. Immediately my mom and her fucking awesome staff met at her house and started making food packs for students and their families. This included breakfast, lunch, and dinner with dessert. Then they would drive it and drop it off at each students house (200 families). They did this for TWO WEEKS until the school system got their shit together and opened up the kitchens and they started providing food again and the bus drivers delivered the food. Those kids were starving and desperate. My mom and her Co workers never got any reimbursement for the cost of food, labor, or gas. But, they don't care.. Seriously this needs to be federal. No kid should go hungry in school ever. Can't learn when you're starving",

But, I'm fucking proud of her.\nShe just wants other kitchen managers and schools to take care of their students. Also for parents to do at least view a quick YouTube video on food nutrition. Don't pack your kids junk food and candy as school lunch. You're literally killing them",

            "comment": "This is an insanely huge improvement and it will definitely improve the schooling system immensely. Kids will not have to worry about being embarrassed by their growling stomachs and they will be able to focus more instead of worrying about how hungry they are. This also gives families that are struggling a helping hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up in California and throughout my whole elementary through high school, I could never afford breakfast, I would end up just asking friends if I can try some of this or that just to get something when I was hungry. Occasionally I would even have to skip lunch and just try and focus in class without my stomach growling and feeling embarrassed because everyone could hear it.\n\nThe worse part is during brunch/lunch times I would just try to hide while everyone ate and thus causing me to have less friends because I wasn't social. Then I would appear after everyone had finished eating. I ended up getting used to just not doing my homework at home and doing it at brunch/lunch time right before classes just because it was my \"excuse\" to not eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words and everything. Yes, I am doing fine now and I am actually in a really good place. After high school I went to college and finished with a M.S. in Computer Engineering. I got lucky and was recruited by one of my professors because they recognized my strive and willingness to succeed. We started a small company and sold it and from there I have been only growing as I have been fortunate to get better positions and moving up. \n\nAnd a response to some people why I didn't have cereal or just a simple breakfast like a PB&amp;J. My mother was a single mother and she was an immigrant that came here when she was young as well. Basically, she never ate breakfast herself so she basically said I don't need breakfast to survive. As for applying for the free lunch programs, I actually never knew this was a thing because I was a kid and I had no knowledge of the workings of the world. The biggest problem was my mother didn't know much as well because I had to handle all my own school registration and everything growing up. I had to forge signatures even though I knew this was not allowed but it was the only way for me to get signed up for classes and even for college. I really think it is harder for first-generation families because their parents don't speak any English and they don't understand the responsibilities required when it comes to the American schooling systems. \n\nAnother thing I really hope changes is the school supplies situation. I remember when all my friends always got new school supplies every year where I was still using a backpack I had since I was in elementary school. Luckily there are teachers that are helpful and willing to help students and then there are the ones that are making it a requirement to buy certain supplies for the class because your grade depended on it. I find it ridiculous when they are expecting families to be able to afford all of these fancy school supplies and required supplies just to pass a class.",

I went to my locker to grab some things before class, meaning to put my \u201clunch\u201d in there until lunchtime.  I guess i forgot to put it in there, because as class started, the bitch teacher walks in with the bag, takes out the sandwich, holds it up, and asks in a humiliating way, who left their lunch in the hallway. The kids started laughing, and I was so embarrassed I didn\u2019t claim it.  I ended up with no lunch that day.  Fun times.  \n\nWow, that was therapeutic.",

If you're any kind of manager and hire anyone you didn't raise yourself, it's directly and literally the case that you benefit from the various social programs that help turn weird helpless squishy baby things into productive adults. More people downstream of you, you pay more into those programs. Easy, right?",

It is usually a wheat muffin, piece of fruit, and a granola bar or something like that.  In addition to free lunch, they also provide another meal for the kids to take home at the end of the day.   \nDuring covid, CPS setup up food pick-up sites at most schools where anyone with a kid could go to any school and pick up free meals.  And, they eventually mailed a loaded EBT (food stamp) card out to the families for every student.  The initial load was $500 and they loaded it twice after that with $225 or something like that.    \nAnd, my kid's school provided all of the technology and some basic school supplies while the kids were at home.  I don't know if this was all schools, but it was nice all the same.  \nMy family out in the burbs was floored by the fact that our school system helped support families like this.  I haven't heard any other schools doing this while the kids were at home.",

I'm glad that other california kids won't have to deal with as much hunger at school anymore.\n\nWe were usually homeless (moving from motel to motel, car to apartment, but never really with an actual place to live for any length of time). My mother was an addict, so getting her to return the forms required for me to get free lunch was impossible. I went most days without food until I got home after school. I learned really unhealthy eating habits because I was constantly in a state of hunger all of the time. I often carried a jar of peanut butter around with me so that I wouldn't get hungry when I was outside playing.\n\nAnd I wasn't the only one. I knew several kids at every school that I went to who experienced this. And the few times that I did get the approved lunch stipend, I was given tickets to buy my own food. However, when you are a kid, with no parental support, no home organization, and no understanding of such things, it's really hard to even keep track of the tickets. So I would have lunch for a few days, and then I would lose the tickets and it would be back to just being hungry.",

The humiliation of having to be poor enough to qualify for free food was something I thought about a lot.\n\nIn High School we made \"too much\" and no longer qualified. But we where still too poor that my mom couldnt buy me and my brother breakfast and lunch every day. So most days the only time my brother and I ate where at dinner.\n\nIts something that I still do today. Im so used to eating that way. Skip food all day and then eat a massove amount of food for dinner. Its so hard to break the habit. To me thats just how you eat.\n\nIt almost brings a tear to my eye that no kid here will have to experience what I experienced and that food isnt going to be something a child has to worry about in a state that is richer than most countries. \n\nI love this state and I hope we can keep moving in this direction",

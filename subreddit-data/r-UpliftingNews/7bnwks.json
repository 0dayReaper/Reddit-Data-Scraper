Ineffective assistance means the lawyer committed malpractice in the criminal context. If a civil lawyer blew your case and appeal by failing to make a proper objection or something else that would give rise to an IAOC claim in the criminal context, you bet your ass that lawyer's malpractice carrier would be paying out.\n\n&gt;In most appeals, this defense is made. \n\nIAOC is not a defense. It is a means of raising an argument on appeal when your trial lawyer fucked up and didn't raise it/preserve it below, which would normally mean it is waived on appeal. If your IAOC succeeds and you get a reversal, it means the trial lawyer fucked up bigtime. ",

In my state all lawyers are assigned family cases (e.g. protection from abuse, guardian ad litems). Additionally, private lawyers can take on labor intensive criminal cases if the public defenders office is conflicted out or too busy. \n\nHowever, when it comes to random assignments, I'd much rather the government pay for more AGs. Often these random attorneys have no experience in criminal law or no interest in defending their client and just do the minimum.",

Like a guy who works at Google and just looks at contracts (very similar ones) all day. The vast vast majority of criminal cases are bodily harm, DUI, drug cases, and theft. Not only that but much of being a trial lawyer has nothing to do with the law, it's about witnesses, gathering necessary facts, devising a trial strategy, presenting a case, etc. A paperpusher has only slightly more of a chance of winning as the defendant himself.",

Worked everyday from 9AM-7PM. And that was one of the highest paid jobs in the prison. Others work for pennies an hour. Doesn't mean some people don't make money though. The guy that was running gambling pools would send home like $800/week to his family. He had been doing that for 6 years by the time I got there. So people involved in things like drugs and cell phones make thousands, literally.\n\nI made money on the side playing poker and other random stuff but mainly I got money from my family so I wasn't too uncomfortable, had a TV and got books sent in, that kinda stuff. At the place I was at you could spend $120/week. There's times where thats not enough because you're just bored and eat for happiness. It's something that distracts you.\n\nAs for protein I just bought pouches of tuna and ate maple and brown sugar oatmeal with peanut butter. I'm a pretty picky eater and you don't have many options in prison, but you won't get big on the prison diet alone, just isn't enough. Also another benefit of working the kitchen. So you can definitely bulk up, some really keep a good diet too and you can tell because those are definitely the bigger people.\n\nEdit: To add the tuna was only $1.79 for like a small sized pouch, but each had 18 grams, and the slightly larger one for $3.15 was 28g of protein.

From the food suppliers, private medical companies, there is just so many jobs created by the corrections industry. Some prisons outsource their labor for a large amount and use prisoners that are paid pennies and hour. You have states not getting medical marijuana legislation passed through because their prison guard union lobby's to have it blocked, knowing a giant portion of their inmates are nonviolent drug offenders.\n\nSome prisons and jails actually do try to rehabilitate their inamtes, the wardens actually see the problem and care. But for every prison that is rehabilitation based you have like 20 prisons that are just warehousing cheap laborers. They offer nothing for rehabilitation and take even more prisoners from other prisons to make more money. \n\nIt's honestly just an evolved version of slavery at some point. A PA judge got caught not long ago sending kids to prison for long sentences to receive kickbacks.",

So violated that probation, and got probation for the other charges. Well, I was a hardcore opiate addict at the time and continued to use and got caught, so 3 more violations. So I had to do all 3 probation sentences in prison, luckily they all ran concurrent so only had 18 months. \n\nSo really I could've gotten 18 months followed by 12 months followed by 12 months more but the judge was relatively lenient given my circumstances. He said he doesn't like sending people to jail for failed drug tests in the first place but since I was on county parole that got aggregated he couldn't do much.  He brought that up because a few months prior the state passed a bill that stopped sending state parolees back to prison for just failing drug tests or not paying court costs. Technical violations. They realized it doesn't make sense and costs taxpayers a lot. But some counties like my own continue to do so but again, it's just another industry. They still send people to jail and prison for tech violations but if you're lucky and an addict you can shoot for treatment. My county has contracts with rehabs and treatment centers so now they just send you to a locked rehab and tax payers foot the bill. They send these young guys to jail for petty shit and they come out professional criminals. I mean they just got done rooming and boarding with felons for stealing an iPod from Walmart. They aren't exactly gonna come out a better person. ",

So even though the prisons are more expensive, the stays are shorter.\n\nAlso on a related note: the death penalty in the US is more expensive than keeping someone in prison for life. Yet they are still killing people (some of them innocent) in the US.",

[Only 20% of recidivism against 76.6% for the USA for the year 2014.](http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12/). This means you end up with a shitload of people who should not dive into recidivism but do anyway so prisons are just their home for life. I am fairly certain Scandinavian prisons are way cheaper in the end, and by the end I mean in a pretty short time, like a few years.",

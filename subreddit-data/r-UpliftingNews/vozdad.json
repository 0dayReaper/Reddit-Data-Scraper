Thankfully the fines are much higher for insurance companies and honestly they're just way better about compliance with regulations, so we'll definitely see prices here.",

Basically, they're saying that you can't force politicians to refrain from making policy decisions based on their faith, because doing so would infringe on their guaranteed freedom of religion. Boiling it down to its simplest form, they're arguing that \"freedom of religion\" includes the freedom to impose your religion on others. \n\nSo yeah, please, don't give them any more fucking ideas.",

Keep in mind, you have to know how much the doctor will cost too at a hospital or facility because you'll get both bills. \n\nThey have to say estimate because if you go in for a service and it changes due to unforseen circumstances, you could end up with more additinal xrays at that cost or your insurance reduced the price. It's too difficult to say exactly what you'll be charged until insurance is shown.",

There are hundreds of variables that may change in a given day at the hospital, insurance company, or the patient that can potentially interfere with a reimbursement; including the insurance company making an amendment to the contract with the hospital arbitrarily with very little notice or time to flex to accommodate. (Usually is a month or year, but has been days notice before)\n\nThe Insurance Company is the casino that will always win,  and the hospital trying to play the best hand with what it was dealt. Also every insurance company with any given hospital has different contracted rates; written in the contract not to be discussed openly or breech of contract.\n\nIt\u2019s probably a whole thread and \u201cclawbacks\u201d from insurance companies. Reimbursements made and later tried to be recouped by them 6months, 1yr, 2yrs later. Then the hospital may have to bill patient. A mess",

This means that it is actually useable and will be a huge game changer. My boss described it as more significant than the ACA (as far as being able to give us work lol).\n\nInsurance companies will be able to see what the hospitals are charging all of the other insurers, giving them better negotiation leverage and driving down healthcare costs.

Hospital blood bank covers compatibility testing (making sure the blood we give you won't harm you), and we can't actually charge you for any of the work we do to get the blood ready for you unless it's actually transfused. The end cost we charge is, I believe, about $500-$600 for a regular old unit of blood. It's significantly more if the blood needs to be irradiated, and somewhat more if we have to check the blood for specific antigens. Antigen typing is weird, because we might have to test 6 or more units to find one that's compatible for you, but again, we can only charge you for antigen typing for any units we actually transfused you with.\n\nAlso remember that the people doing all this work (hi!) deserve a reasonable wage since getting the wrong blood can literally kill you. :D",

Since it's basic preventative care, they then covered that cost so it was free to me.\n\nIt's crazy to think about. If I'm uninsured, I have to pay $500 for the blood test. But if I'm insured, my insurance company pays only a tenth of that. It should be illegal to charge an uninsured person so much more.",

When I asked about getting a portable oxygen until so I could travel to visit my daughter 2 states away, I was told insurances won't cover portable units for post-covid patients.  \n\nDafuq? I'm supposed to carry my 30+ lb concentrator around with me everywhere that I go. It's that or get oxygen tanks from local providers who aren't covered in network, as is out of state. Yet, they want me to \"get out and exercise\" and have nurses call constantly to check if I'm keeping up my regimen. The only workout I have is hefting these oxygen canisters and concentrator.  \n\nThe system is fucked hard-core..",

For example, you could have a collapsed lung, and even though I could put a chest tube in 4 minutes or less, it's still a potential life saving maneuver even though it doesn't take a bunch of time.\n\nReducing a dislocated hip to restore blood flow to your lower limb (and thus saving it) can also be done relatively quickly. But it has a lasting impact.\n\nWhereas some lacerations can take 40 minutes to repair even though it's not limb or life saving. \n\nSo you can't really correlate time spent with service provided. \n\nBut it's frustrating. I get it. I think for profit insurance companies and the worst thing to happen to health care.",

I was launched nearly 20m or so after we were hit by a red-light runner. \n\nI had hit the ground, slid and rolled most of the way. I stood up. Didn't say a thing. Limped back to the vehicle where I saw my friend. Standing there, bloody and bruised. The red-light runner said something, but I can't remember. I walked by her and went into a Jack in the Box on the corner. I remember ordering a chicken sandwich, going into the bathroom and washing blood and gravel off of my arm and face. \n\nI left the restroom and I remember being so fucking hungry for some reason. As I'm eating the chicken sandwich, the EMT's came in with a backboard. They kept telling me to lay down, but all I wanted to do was eat. After downing my sandwich while they were grabbing me, they forced me onto the backboard and strapped me in. They slid me into the ambulance and we drove off. \n\nApparently, I was in shock. I got to the hospital, went through all the usual tests and x-rays and shit. Not really knowing anything. I broke my wrist. Multiple fractures all over my body. I was covered in cuts, scrapes, road rash and caked in blood. The nurses scrubbed me down and that hurt like a bitch. They said they had to get the gravel out of my wounds. \n\nI slept for a day. It was great. Ended up being scared of cars for a while. \n\nAnyways, back to the point. I remember them scrubbing my wounds cost about 12k.

Collection agencies may still try to collect even after it's expired, but by then you legally don't have to pay. \n\nNot saying skipping out on your debts is good, but when it comes to your health in your shitty system... get what you need, don't acknowledge, ride it out.",

But even a bottle of pills that are similar to Tums (they're called phosphorus binders which give my patients an added boost of preventing them from absorbing phosphorus in the food that they eat).... Cost over 1,000 for a bottle. The price gouging is absolutely shameless. I'm appalled to work for a blatantly for profit industry that turns human lives into commodities..but on the other hand someone's got to run my patients' treatments and I love what I do.

There was a month where they were out &amp; manufacturer had issues, and the clinic said I could try getting them from my pharmacy. \n\nManufacturer wasn't in network, and for a measly 30 pill bottle was $2,000!! For reference, I need 4 pills each meal; 2 with snacks. Meals alone a day are 12 pills, and a week without snacks is at least 84 pills, or almost 3 bottles! In the end I had to take a different medication that wasn't as effective, and as a result my phosphorus levels were way off. \n\nAlso, thank you SO MUCH for your hard work - it's much appreciated \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95",

This resulted in a 5 day hospital admission.  \n\nThe January bout had me in the ICU for 6 weeks, of which 5 was on a ventilator. I had been tubed for 2 weeks when they weaned and extubated me. Apparently, I was off the vent for a few hours until a change of bedding, and the shifting me around, caused clots to break loose in my lungs. I coded and was trached. Over the next few days I coded several more times. They have me a less than 40% chance of several.  \n\nI was in the hospital for over 3 months and had to learn to talk eat and walk again. I'm happy to say that I'm recovering fairly well, with good days and bad days.  \n\nMy total bills for hospital care, various physicians, testing, therapy and vent step-down facility was over $500,000. My insurance paid out less than $50,000.  \n\nThankfully, I not only had insurance coverage of my own but also through my spouse. My out of pocket was minimal, but had I been uninsured, we'd be destroyed financially.  \n\nThis is not right, nor fair, in what was once the most respected and wealthiest 1st world country.  \n\nWe must have transparency.\n\nEdit: Before anyone asks:  \n\nYes, I was fully vaxxed with 1 booster at the time I became ill.

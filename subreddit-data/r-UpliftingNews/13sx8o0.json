A lot of mining runs on electricity, so if it's sourced from nuclear it can actually be quite clean.  If they run the mine on diesel generators it can be dirty.\n\nBut no, it's not anywhere near as dirty as a car polluting for its entire life.  Basically the only difference is mining for batteries-- and most of that material is recyclable at the end of its life",

But there's been some big breakthroughs with battery tech recently.\n\n1) Back in April 2023 CATL announced a 500Wh/kg energy density which is huge. (Production 2024) which currently Tesla's new ones have 272-296Wh/kg. But this likely will be used for air travel for now to 'test' it out. I could see a 2026-2028 roll out for cars. \n\n2) Gotion High Tech announced just the other day that battery pack will go into mas production in 2024 for 1000km range and lasts 2 million kms. Again, probably currently will be expensive, likely won't hit 1000km range.. and likely won't last that long. \n\n  \nBut, it ends up saying that there's more research and funding into battery and EVs than ever before, and we are starting to see a shift.\n\nIt's not to say that \"Whats more green\". Short term, this isn't more green. Long term it is more green. Investing into renewables and creating very feasible and long lasting things might be worth it.\n\nOnly caveat.. I don't think manufacturers will ever want anything last too long. So it becomes an issue there. Although if they're targeting air travel. A plane lasts \\~ 30 years, flies around 3500 hours a year and 500miles/hr speed on average.. so during 30 years it will fly 52.5 million miles. Or 83 million km.  Or about 41 batteries in 30 years for a plane.",

A lot of people around me tried to convince me it was a waste of money and how it would take 25 years to pay back. Which is such an outdated take on it. At the moment we will pay it back within 7 years. Every house should have it. Government's globally should be helping the people with grants etc.",

Electric for a month for my house should be around 150 pounds due to the price hike. From march we've saved nearly 70 percent on our electric bills. Maybe more. Basically over 100 quid a month.

I dont know if it will be enough and on time, but there realy is a lot happening compared to 20 years ago and that makes me slightly optimistic.\n\nAnd yeah, again, fuck the fossil industry",

But longer term storage? I don\u2019t see enough people saying \u201cI don\u2019t mind waking up in the morning to find my car at 10-50% charge when I expected 100%\u201d, especially in rural areas.\n\nAnd again, those batteries are fucking expensive. With cycle counts of 1000-3000, that\u2019s going to add sooooo much wear &amp; tear to these expensive batteries.\n\nFor managing peaks and stuff, great, but when Denmark has days where wind output is 5-10% of capacity? No fucking way will recharging that many cars make sense.",

There is currently a 3rd oil/gas boom going on right now, BUT the cities are also surrounded by several solar and wind farms. 10 years ago the only renewable farm out there was in Big Spring.\n\nIt's also noticeable in the industries that have popped up. Previous oil/gas boom-bust cycles would see a bunch of drilling and pipe specialized businesses set up for ~decade and then tool down to skeletons once the price collapsed and the big wigs had made their money. However, this time there are more generalized manufacturing companies popping up which seem aimed at pivoting to renewable work once the current boom busts.\n\nPublic facing Tx politics don't tell the full story either, they'd never admit the heavy investment in renewables going on in the state. It's a different story amongst the energy brokers in Houston who see the writing on the wall. Even if they aren't altruistically motivated by climate change they know the state NEEDS a fuck ton more power, and the \"good\" side of our shitty, unregulated power grid means there is a fair amount of movement in the industry.\n\nNow we gotta work on concrete alternatives because west Tx is also tore up with sand and gravel quarries.",

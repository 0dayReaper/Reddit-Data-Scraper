There several companies wanting to use the forest for their need, one of the is Caltex (now chevron) oil and gas company. The tribes refused to relocated into the urban areas, because they have been living like that for generations and according to tribe's law (my country acknowledge the practice of tribe's law) it's their land. So the company starting forest fire during dry season to force them relocated into deeper part of forest or assimilate into urban society. No media allowed to report or investigate it because, they bribed the state's official and bought the land illegally from the states, since the tribe relocated \"by themself\" so it's become state owned land.",

Total, Shell, etc... are no idiots - they know very well that oil will run out. They are trying to use the massive cashflow they currently have to diversify into other industries, generally either other power sources or other chemical processing industries (since those two sectors are the closest to their core business). E.g Total is heavily investing into wind turbines in Europe.",

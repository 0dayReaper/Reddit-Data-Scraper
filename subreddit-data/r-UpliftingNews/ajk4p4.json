And nowhere else is this mentioned in the news and there are no courts that are open at this hour.  So this is a very misleading headline but the post will stay up to highlight her compassionate act and raise awareness for recognizing it.",

She said after leaving urgent care she went to a CVS Pharmacy to have a prescription filled for Amoxicillin, again using her insurance and son\u2019s name.\n\n\n&gt;Smitherman said that she did not contact child welfare authorities because she feared the student would be placed in a foster home. \n\n&gt;Smitherman also said that **she has helped the student in the past by buying clothes for him and cleaning his home**, the affidavit states.",

For example in England the decision whether or not to prosecute is taken by a branch of government called the CPS and one of the considerations they use is whether or not it would be in the 'public interest', i.e. if it's actually beneficial to society. In the USA I assume similar organisations exist who also have that authority - they're pretty much ubiquitous in liberal democracies. \n\nI can't envisage they would prosecute in this instance. Of course she has made a decision and there may be personal ramifications regarding her relationship with her health insurer, employer etc, but that was her choice to make and the potential consequences were hers to evaluate. A criminal prosecution isn't automatically going to happen simply because of a technical breach of a criminal law though.",

But sounds like maybe urgent care turned her away, since not parent, and based on the name she went to a hospital which prob would have been more. That said I bet she could have gotten a RN to get the prescription and total out of pocket cost for everything could be under 100. Sounds like real issue was she wasn\u2019t the parent, which lead her into the insurance fraud. \n\nThis case is def no big deal,  but I definitely hope we don\u2019t see people sharing insurance plans like Netflix plans.

I'm always debating this with my family because they all voted in the current shitshow and hated Obama forcing healthcare. Would you be kind enough to inform me about the NHS? It doesn't have to be a lengthy explanation. I just don't know how to counter the idiotic arguments against it because I don't really know. I don't know anybody who has experienced universal healthcare. Most comparisons are made to Canada since it's closer, however their arguments against Canada's system are still off base. Is it a percentage of taxes? If you don't mind my asking, how much? What's free and what comes out of your pocket when you're sick? \n\nI always tell them I am fine with paying a little more in taxes if it benefits the overall health of our country because right now, Americans use the Emergency Room because they wait too long, and tax payers end up paying more $ anyway. They don't get it. I would love to throw down a sentence or two as bluntly as possible.\n\n*Edit* I just wanted to thank everybody for the different replies because I don't think Americans get to hear these kind of examples. You all have helped me get a better grasp of how healthcare can look with examples from all over the world.\nYou guys are the best.",

Essentially, you just have a Medicare card, and if you need to visit a GP for example, you simply look for any that offer bulk billing (This means they basically accept a lower payout, in exchange for the government covering the cost, so they will essentially get more business). As an example, I've had relatively good luck with health in my life (I'm early-mid 20s and I've only visited a GP on probably 7 or 8 occasions during this time), and I've so far paid a total of $0 for any of it. Paying for any medications I've been prescribed has never cost me more than $20 maximum for the full course.\n\nI've never needed to go to hospital, so I can't speak for that either, but as an additional example, paying $50 a year gets you Ambulance Membership, meaning that any ambulance rides you need to take are entirely free. For the vast majority of hospital procedures, assuming you go to a public hospital, you will never see a bill.\n\nIn terms of how it's paid for, it's mostly tax money. We have an additional tax surchage called the Medicare Levy, which is 2% of your taxable income per year. This full 2% is only for individuals above a certain income threshold though (it is fairly low however, you're exempt from Medicare Levy if you earn less than $22k per year, for reference, our minimum full-time wage is just under $40k per year).\n\nThe only things that are not covered by our healthcare are most cosmetic procedures and other \"voluntary\" services. For example, general dental care typically isn't covered, I have private health insurance instead which I pay about $50 per month for, which covers all of my dental costs for the year usually.\n\nAs a final example. my girlfriend has had health issues spanning for a while, and has had to see a specialist several times for a possible PCOS diagnosis, as well as had multiple x-rays and ultrasounds etc, and is still yet to pay a cent for any of it.\n\nUltimately, I'm probably not the best person to speak about this, but I hope it gives you at least some perspective on it!",

There's no special NHS tax so \"How much?\" can't be answered correctly. Government makes do with the taxes they collect. The rest is made up by dentistry, minuscule prescription charges and National Insurance contributions from workers. You pay National Insurance if you\u2019re 16 or over and either an employee earning above \u00a3162 a week or self-employed and making a profit of \u00a36,205 or more a year. [The payment varies depending on your income, designated class etc](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance/how-much-you-pay)\n\n&gt;What's free and what comes out of your pocket when you're sick?\n\nPretty much most of the stuff even the long term life threatening conditions. But not everything. You gotta pay for Eye-tests (about \u00a360) if you are an adult of working age (Kids and Old people get them free), Dentists (Cost varies depending on your condition/\"Band\"- \u00a320 to \u00a3250 - if you need another treatment in the same band or lower after the first one within two months then it will be free), wigs etc. Minor things mostly. The real problem is that there are long waiting lists for some conditions and the staff is overworked.\n\n",

I would be lying if I wasn't a little stunned at 80%. **Correction, I read that wrong...he meant 80% of the NHS comes from taxes.** However, I would be curious how much of a % the American \"healthcare system\" actually comes out of paychecks. I would wager it's much higher than we think it is, given the costs. \n\nThank you for the reply. I hope you have a wonderful weekend!",

Seriously? if I ever need medical assistance, I need to make it clear that I am not going to an ambulance. Call me an uber instead to take me to the hospital. \n\n\nGoing to a hospital here in the US even with insurance, you need to be 100% sure you\u2019ll die unless you go.",

She was a sweet lady in her late 40s or early 50s who had no biological kids of her own.\n\nMs. G would give the kids that had no lunch sandwiches she made herself and a juice box. Both were kept in the minifridge in the class which she bought with her own money. She also had all the kids who had no friends sit with her during lunch time and kept them company. I was one of those kids that had no friends. \n\nAbout 16-17 years later, I came back to my home town after finishing college for the first time. I found out through an acquaintance that Ms.G had been fired for scolding some parents during a parent-teacher conference because they weren't taking their child's education seriously. She died about a month after that.\n\nWhen I read stories like this I think about Ms. G and feel very sad. \n",

She is apparently an awesome person, recently appointed to this from being the principal of another school.  \n\nI was really worried when the story was first relayed to me, because stories about teachers and felonies rarely end well these days, but in this case I think the court showed appropriate leniency and humanity.

They were testing masked areas 5mm^2 and estimating an output of 5\u00b5W/cm^2\n\nThey also state that \"apreliminary study showed that an Air-gen device placed in an airgap of commeasurable size to device thickness (e.g., 20 \u00b5m) could retain electric output.[19] This leads to an estimated energy density of &gt;1 kW m^\u22123 in vertically integrated Air-gen (although this value is still subject to the available energy flow in the environment). \"\n\nBy emphasising the 3D stackability they are trying to distinguish it from other methods such as solar or thermoelectric. For instance thermoelectrics are 0.6W/m^2, wind is 10 and solar is likely 1000 peak. This is estimated at 0.0001-0.05. \n\nIt's interesting as they imply it doesn't use up the humidity nor require a humidity gradient. Which would make it ideal for high humidity areas. I'm going to have to read up more on this. I suspect low initial energy density and cost of mass manufacture would be the current limiting factors preventing any real scaling of the tech.",

The charge of the electron was actually first measured by looking at oil droplets in a vertical chamber. The droplets fall, then you switch on a field, some droplets have a positive charge, and they will fall faster than with the field off, and they drop out, assuming the negative terminal is down and the positive terminal is up. Then you turn off the field, let the droplets drop back into the frame, then you turn it on again, some droplets go up higher and faster. You can measure their rates of acceleration by distance traveled, and it happens in integer multiples proportional to charge, but they have slightly different masses. You can estimate the masses of the droplets by their diameters. Eventually, all droplets experience the same acceleration because the rest have left the experimental window, and all those droplets have a negative charge of a single electron. \n\nWhen a liquid evaporates, the rate of evaporation is proportional to the surface area. With lots of tiny droplets, the surface area of all the oil in different droplets explodes, compared to oil sitting in an open barrel. The more evaporation due to a huge surface area, with less volume due to evaporation, means that small droplets evaporate at an increasingly quick rate, so the hit the ground as toxic pollution in molecule form, but not as a raindrop of fuel.",

They tend to be a huge amount of work for very little pay, which means only those who are financially well off are able to take them. It's one of the biggest barriers of \"normal folk\" getting into politics. You just ending up with city counselors who only represent the business/investment class.  \n\nAlso, if you can't get any experience at the lower levels of government you are less likely to be able to run for a higher position. This extends up to most state level legislatives as well, which pay very little money and often require the commitment of a full time job.",

The entire idea of career politics should be done away with. We should not have a bunch of old millionaires deciding the fate of the rest of us especially when we know how many politicians are just looking out for themselves and nobody else or are straight up evil and don't care who knows it. Turn our government into jury duty where everyone has to take part and the entire collective of citizens gets a chance to participate equally.",

I myself am not smart enough to come up with the entire solution but I am smart enough to know our current system is broken and set up to primarily serve those who already have money and/or influence of one kind of another.\n\nPerhaps making government operations a bigger part of public education would help some with a lottery/jury style approach. Also not stating to have a single person elected by lottery to serve as president but instead make all the political duties shared among a large group of randomly selected individuals where none has more power than the other so there is less chance of stupid or malicious people causing problems. \n\nThere are certainly flaws to every solution but finding the strengths of each and combining solutions may be key to a better way forward",

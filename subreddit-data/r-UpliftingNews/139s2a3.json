I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very gentle, but repetitive motions on a small area of skin can get very irritating. I\u2019ll take a mammogram over this any day: it can be painful as it smashes, but it only lasts a second. But if I lived in a place where I couldn\u2019t get a mammogram, I would be grateful for this screening no matter how irritating it was. Breast cancer is a plague.",

But a lot of women feel more comfortable with a woman performing exams and may be more likely to allow treatment by a woman on regular basis than they from a man. Not to mention, in very poor or rural areas, going to a doctor is seen as a big expense/inconvenience. Having these women in those communities where other women are already more likely to allow screening if done by another woman could be the difference between life and death. \n\nAs well, it gives a historically underemployed population a chance at having a socially acceptable job and their own money. Instead of being a crab in a bucket, take this for the win that it is for the disabled community as a whole.",

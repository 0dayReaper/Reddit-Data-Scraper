It can even be extracted from seawater. But extraction is not keeping up with demand and is unlikely to for some time so developing recycling methods is definitely needed. especially since lithium isn't used up in old batteries. But even with the current supply constraints on lithium, nickel and especially cobolt are currently much more scarce at the moment. The shortage of cobolt has caused Tesla and other companies to move away from using it in their batteries but the  resulting new batteries (lithium iron phosphate battery) are heavier have reduced range but cheaper and less fire risk.",

You get better results with a less performant electric car, like a SR+ model 3.

Can we replace the acid, refine the plates, etc and bring back a percentage of the battery charge? Maybe that EV you bought started with 350 mile range and now it\u2019s down to 250. You can buy a new battery for $20k or refurb your existing one at $2k and get it back to 300 miles. \n\nJust making guesses as to the future.",

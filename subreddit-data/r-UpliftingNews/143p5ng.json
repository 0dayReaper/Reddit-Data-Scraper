            "comment": "Paywall. \n\n\nFueled by a surge of funding from the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida has plans to rapidly rehouse homeless veterans in Orange, Seminole and Osceola counties.\n\nOfficials Wednesday announced a campaign following a promise of $6.7 million in federal grants \u2014 double last year\u2019s total \u2014 to connect veterans and their families with a range of resources from rental assistance and housing expenses, to medical care and other support.\n\nThe money will not only offer more services but also help families receive them quicker, the network said. It also is meant to help those who may presently have housing but are at risk of falling into homelessness. The campaign vowed that \u201cno veteran will be left behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow is the time that Central Florida will engage in the final push to ensure that our veterans receive the support that they need and deserve,\u201d said Martha Are, the CEO of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. \u201cWe have the ability to help more veterans and more families than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe region has effectively ended homelessness among veterans with disabilities, Are said, but a recent federal census found there are at least 189 veterans experiencing homelessness in Central Florida. That figure is widely considered to be an undercount.\n\nAs a whole, the metro area counted a 5% increase in people experiencing homelessness in the last year, according to the federal count. It\u2019s about a 75% increase from 2019, which is prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe increase is blamed primarily on rising rents and housing costs, as well as a shortage of available affordable housing.\n\n\u201cWe know a number of people are experiencing homelessness due to things that were exacerbated by the pandemic and the lack of affordable housing, and the mental health crisis and opioid crisis,\u201d Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the No Veteran Left Behind initiative is so important.\u201d\n\nFederal funding will allow the Homeless Services Network to rapidly rehouse veterans and provide necessary wrap-around services to treat conditions such as substance abuse or addressing mental health.\n\nDistrust, past trauma and not knowing whether they qualify for help are among the barriers that have kept veterans from applying for previous aid, the network said in a release.\n\nThe network is currently supporting about 750 veterans in housing programs, Are said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough because we know there are veterans still out there who are struggling and are suffering without a roof over their heads.\u201d\n\nSeminole County Commissioner Bob Dallari said the effort is a chance to compassionately respond to veterans with complicated challenges, and show gratitude for their service.\n\n\u201cIt takes compassion; it takes funding; and it takes the ability to show them the way home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a house, it\u2019s not just a place to put a head on a bed, but it\u2019s a chance to go home.\u201d",

Might as well get another one lined up. Incidentally, the pension is now gone. They\u2019ve moved to more of a 401k type retirement plan which is more beneficial to those that don\u2019t spend 20+ years in. You at least have something started. \n\nAs for the disability, if you want the aches and pains to be taken care of you have to get the documentation while you\u2019re in. I can only speak about the Army because that\u2019s what I was in, but they stigmatized going to sick call. Called it being a \u201csick call Ranger\u201d to the point people would ignore legitimate problems. Then you get out and the things you wouldn\u2019t have done to your body normally which caused damage are now on you to deal with and hope your insurance is good. Or you get them documented and service connected so the VA takes care of them.",

Also wings are beautiful. \n\nMy lovebird hadn't been allowed to fly before I got her. For the first year she'd figure out a new move then yell at you until you watched. Then happy hops. So freaking cute.\n\n*the past tense is because flying is old news now, she doesn't show it off anymore. She had a phase of learning to climb this rock pillar, with lots of showing off. And she's still happy and healthy! Her current phase is trying to figure out wtf this weird light box is for. I added this because I realized past tense implied she died.",

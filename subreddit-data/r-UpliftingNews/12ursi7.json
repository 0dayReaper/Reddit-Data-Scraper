We\u2019re 20 days into giving him a shot of it every day, along with a half ML of gabbapentin as well. He went from extremely frail and lethargic to completely back to normal in about ~4/5 days of starting the medicine. We\u2019re not out of the weeds yet, but the results so far are very promising. He literally gets zoomies again which we haven\u2019t seen from him in a while.\n\nSince the medicines not FDA approved in America yet, my wife has to order the vials from a Facebook group. We\u2019ve spent $800 (+$60 shipping) on 10 vials so far, and will be ordering more soon. We suddenly lost our last kitten to FIP in December, so we feel it\u2019s more than worth it to keep this kitten alive since we didn\u2019t have time to treat our last one.",

She was planning her FIP cat's euthenasia. This was mid 2020. We discussed options. Then she calls me again a couple hours later telling me to cancel it, as she found a cure. I told her she was being taken advantage of, that FIP is always fatal. She told me there was a new thing, that you had to order it \"for research purposes\" and essentially smuggle it into the country, but it worked.\n\nA month later she asked me to fill in for her to inject the cat one evening while she was at a wedding. I met this poor, skinny kitty with dry FIP. The injection caused him terrible pain and burning. I wasn't sure if it was working but I helped her out and gave the injection.\n\nThen another month later I get another call asking if I can fill in one more time. I show up and there's this cat and he's playful and happy and running around and 50% larger than the last time I saw him. The injection barely hurt him at all and he seemed fine with it.\n\nThe last time I heard from her was two and a half years after the initial FIP diagnosis. The cat is alive and well.\n\nWhen I told local veterinarians about it most of them hadn't even heard of it yet. Now they all have. I swear, it felt like hiv in the 80s when the first patient started getting AZT. Like watching the Dead come back to life.",

We were always wondering if we were just torturing the poor kitten. Partway through her 2nd round of treatment, her adoptive family wanted to learn how to do the shots so they took her. She seems to be doing well. \n\nThat relapse came on quick though and I hope this time she does well. I read the rate of survival after a 2nd round is really high.",

Playful, happy, eating. Then after she finished her 90 days and then a few weeks of observation she started hiding, stopped playing. She ate less, drank less. Her hiding became better and better. It took longer and longer for me to find her. She started eating kitty litter. \n\nOne night I found her in my closet and took her to her room to feed her. She flopped over and couldn't walk! That's when we started the shots right away. The treatments are so new and the foster group hadn't dealt with a relapse before so we were hitting new territory with her. Yay me right? The next day she couldn't move except for weird spasms but I knew her brain was working and her thoughts were there. I wrapped her in a towel so she couldn't hurt herself. After a few days she got up and wobbled around and by a day or two later she was almost back to normal. \n\nIt's a crazy disease. I can't wait for the treatment to be approved and get it off the \"black market.\" Maybe one day they'll find one that's not so painful too.",

Three years later and he\u2019s still healthy and alive! (We also had to order it for research purposes, and then reconstitute a powder into some sort of injection. The box came with a different label on the outside, I assume for customs reasons. It was all so sketchy but worth it.)",

Hurt me financially, but her one year checkup looked amazing on April 1 and I\u2019d do it all over again! She is incredibly happy and playful and one of the true joys in my life\n\nEdit: in case any other FIP survivor parents (lol) are confused about my 60 mile round trip\u2026we attempted the injection at home and she did not react well, at all. I think it traumatized me as much as it did her. The lady that we were getting the medicine from did the first two daily injections and then I did it under her supervision a couple times. She took it like a champ, no issues, no noises, nothing. But when I tried it at home she was hissing and meowing and very upset. So, as much as neither of us wanted to be in a car every day (including birthdays, thanksgiving, christmas, etc), that saint of a lady volunteered to inject her for the entirety of her treatment. we would always bring her lunch and help her with her various charities and volunteer projects as much as possible. to any of you that handled the injections at home\u2026nothing but respect lol you are truly stronger than I could ever be.\n\nsecond edit: the medicine lady was already injecting other cats, as well. it wasn\u2019t only for us. and we would also typically give her $100 on top of every weekly medicine purchase.",

You had to inject it a bunch of times because your cat\u2019s body would clear it quickly. The whole point of the modifications that made Remdisivir was that your body could use more of the active drug compared to the older versions. The OP\u2019s article is about Molnupiravir which is sold under the brand name of Lagevrio by Merck. Molnupiravir never really got traction in the US for COVID because Paxlovid worked quite a bit better and was released in the same month.\n\nOther interesting facts about this whole thing: Paxlovid was able to come to market so \u201cfast\u201d because we had already run the animal studies\u2026 We wanted to use it to treat FIP. It had a rebound problem and more than half of the cats in the trial were still in full blown FIP anyways.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1098612X17729626",

Like idiots. Ivermectin is an amazing drug that works great against parasites, when dosed properly. It doesn't do shit against COVID and it especially doesn't work when brain dead people use the horse medication.",

What in the world is wrong with you people and politicizing medicine. Politics has nothing to do with taking care of your health.  Around 80% of the people I saw in the ICU were obese. That's the most important thing in life is to take care of yourself with exercise and a proper diet. I cant believe I live in a society where people think it's okay to call someone names because they lost faith in a system that sold us out. Our healthcare outcomes are close to the bottom compared to other countries.  But I'm the problem because I question these things and don't trust businessmen.  I trust practicing doctors and real world data and what I see personally.  I feel like I'm being told to only eat from this farm that has 10 farmers, and 3 of them got fired or quit because they say the field is covered in poison and the other 7 eat food from a different farm. As long as someone in government tells you to eat the food and it's safe you just will comply. I would rather do what the farmers do in this scenario",

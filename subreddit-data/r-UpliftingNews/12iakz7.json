This is probably the first indication that the right people are being hired as there isn't a massive skew towards men, and it's harder for women to obtain these roles.

This is a self-demonstrative fact requiring less than a moment's thought to realise.\n\nIgnorant jackasses would probably be ignorant of the fact that NZ was the first self-governed country on the planet to grant the vote to women. They'd be ignorant of that, and they would be jackasses.\n\nDo you want to tell me some more about how an obviously prejudicial reaction is totally normal, thus clearly demonstrating that you are prejudiced?

            "comment": "I volunteered for an organization that worked with children with various disabilities. The kids rode the horses with various amounts of help.  Some were able to sit on their own, some had spotters walking along either side, some had an adult riding double with them to help support them in the saddle, etc.\n\n\nIt was incredible to watch every single one of those kids just bloom.  We had one little boy that apparently only spoke when he was at the facility and around the horses.  One older girl cried the first time she rode because she had never walked before.  \n\nPlus I got to work with the horses.  They were just shockingly empathetic.  They knew what those kids needed.  If the kid was scared, the horses would all walk super slowly or even just stop on their own for a second.  If the kid was getting bored, they'd step it up and prance a bit.  Obviously these horses were selected because they were super sweet tempered, but they all loved the job as much as we did.\n\n\n I loved that gig, incredibly rewarding.",

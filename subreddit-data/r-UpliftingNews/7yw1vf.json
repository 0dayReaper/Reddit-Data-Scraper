Most people who go to college end up with some debt (maybe $600, maybe $600,000).

Best thing to do is just don't let them provoke you, if you don't have a reaction its not that funny.\n\nIt all comes down to social skills, if you don't have them and you don't know how to properly respond to a bully then it just makes the 'teasing' funnier. Aggressive teasing is where it turns into excessive bullying.",

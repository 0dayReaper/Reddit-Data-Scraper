When they made medical marijuana legal here, she heard good things and decided to give it a try even though she's never smoked before.  She now can move and do things before she takes her first dose of carbidopa/levadopa in the morning just by taking a few pulls from her vape pen.  Same at night.  When her meds wear off, she can take a few pulls and get through to bedtime.  It's truly been a great help in managing her symptoms.",

Once she tried edible chocolate instead.  She ate one piece and didn't really feel anything so she ate another.  Turns out it just took a while for it to kick in.\n\nEDIT: She uses Indica at night and Sativa during the day.",

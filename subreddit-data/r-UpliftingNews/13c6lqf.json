The heavy rains broke the levees surround the area and now Lake Tulare is back! Plus, experts think it will grow larger as the snow pack in the Sierras melt.\n\nThe reason I love this lake is because I have been saying for about 10 years now that the CA Legislature, led by two of the dumbest people on the planet, Gov. Brown and Gov. Newsom, should have built more reservoirs to save the water in the rainy years. \n\nCA goes through a cycle of weather extremes now thanks to climate change. It can be dry for many years and then the floodgates will open and it gets tons of rain and snow. So, if you get a water windfall every few years, wouldn't it be wise to save as much of that water as possible? Thus, build more reservoirs.\n\nBut Gov. Newsom is far too stupid to listen to the scientists and he just does what he wants - or what the lobbyists want. \n\nI see Lake Tulare as a comeuppance against this stupid man and his equally blind and stupid advisers.\n\n[https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151174/return-of-tulare-lake](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151174/return-of-tulare-lake)",

And sure enough, the latter is what the west prefers. There\u2019s a reason why so much money is going into domestic chip production in the west. \n\nTaiwan is, more than anything else, a symbolic thing for China. They will attempt reunification before them current Chinese parties\u2019 100 year anniversary. They\u2019re intent is clear. If they invaded Taiwan today it would have the added benefit of threatening the semiconductor market sure. But that would impact China too. So it\u2019s not really about the chips to China. They really really really just don\u2019t like the idea of a neighbor saying \u201cactually, we\u2019re the legitimate Chinese government\u201d &lt;&lt;&lt; which is a technical truth even if it\u2019s been de facto wrong for the last 6 decades.",

Look into the Patient Assistance Programs that the Pharmaceutical Companies offer. \n\nThey are pains in the ass to navigate and their reps are generally awful(especially NovoNordisk), but if you are uninsured and generally under 250% - 400% of the FPL most of them can help you get the medication for free. \n\nThey are generally ass holes about insurance coverage because apparently even if they cover a dollar you don\u2019t qualify any assistance, but it is a way to get insulin\u2019s for free if you fall into those small guidelines.\n\nIf you need a place to start looking look at NeedyMeds.com. It shows the different Patient Assistance Programs, and foundations that help people in hard spots.",

But we just can't afford for both of us to get a low deductible plan. Wife needs it more than I do, and I'm happy to give it up. I just wish it wasn't like this.\n\n I have plaque psoriasis. I hate going to see dermatologists, not because I hate going but because I just can't afford the visit. Last one charged me $300 for a 15 minute visit, I was in the waiting room longer. Then prescribed me a medicine that costs about 1,100. Wife had to jump through a ton of hoops to get it lowered to 50$/dose. I hate that it's so expensive, I shouldn't have to worry about breaking our bank because I had to see a doctor.",

Don't feel discouraged about getting denied. 95% get denied the first two times. 80% the third time before it goes to hearing. Some advice for you and anyone else seeking help:   \n\n1) Get a lawyer. Their fees are capped, and they only get paid if they win. Also, non-bias is B.S., people with lawyers are absolutely seen and handled differently that those who represent themselves (mostly because they know what their doing).    \n\n2) Get your shit together. By that I mean paperwork. How you 'feel' means little compared to what a doctor says and proof.   \n\n3) If your condition is severe or life threatening, ask for your case to be expedited. Your case will be reviewed within 30 days rather than sitting on a shelf for over a year. Also, if there is any significant change in your condition, ask again.\n\n4) Keep appealing. There are people going through their 8th+ appeal.   \n\nGood luck, and hope you do better soon.",

Meds cost an average of 40\u20ac if I take into account the expensive ones.\n\nPrivate dentists go from 20 to 70\u20ac. I got one of my wisdom teeth removed for 45\u20ac, needing stitches and all.\n\nMy private psychologist charges 45\u20ac for an 1hour consult, my psychiatrist 70\u20ac for the same time. \n\nI have a lot of stomach problems, I even had to go to the ER because I was vomiting blood, I was admitted immediately, got my stomach pumped and an endoscopy. Then I was referred to a specialist, I went to get an appointment for it on a Friday, they gave me the appointment for the following Monday. Yes, there are months long waits for non serious cases. But if you've got a serious oen you get priority and you don't ever pay a single cent for medical care, our taxes pay for that. \n\nWhy are your private doctors so expensive?\nI know why you don't have proper universal health care (because of the idiots against it) but the price of private healthcare is insane.",

My insurance stopped covering Humalog and does not show its \u201cgeneric\u201d Lispro as an option yet.\n\nI am well aware of savings/discount cards. I used Novo nordisk\u2019s savings card for Novolog, but those only provide for 2 years.\n\nI stopped using the \u201cWalmart insulins\u201d N and R almost 20 years ago upon the insistence of my new (at the time) doctor, who was absolutely aghast that I still used them. There is a reason they are cheap now - technology has surpassed them. They will keep you from dying, but the other insulins used now help you control blood sugar faaaaaar better and will keep you healthier, and alive, longer. There is a difference there.\n\nI am on a HDHP through my husband\u2019s employer. No, HDHP\u2019s usually don\u2019t make sense for people with chronic health conditions, but it is the only option available. The out of pocket max for this plan is $5000, which is a decent deal considering we could be paying ACA premiums out of pocket, plus Rx and doctor visit copays and coinsurance. \n\nType 1 Diabetics *can not* control blood sugars by avoiding carbs. Your blood sugar will still rise even if you starve yourself. Google \u201cdiabetes before insulin\u201d if you want to traumatize yourself with pictures of skeletal diabetic children who did just that and died horrible deaths anyway.\n\nThere are 2 main types of diabetes. I have Type 1, the autoimmune kind where your body stops making and processing it\u2019s own insulin. Most diabetics taking insulin are Type 1, but more and more Type 2\u2019s are using insulin now as new insulins come on the market. So comments like \u201cStop eating sugar, fatty\u201d are not only ignorant and misinformed, but also make you a raging asshole.",

You are absolutely right.\n\nWhat those people don't get is that socialized medicine is everyone taking care of everyone else.  At least, that is my perspective on it.  By creating, supporting, and helping to keep a socialized medicine system alive, we would regain some of what we have lost in the last 70 years.  We as a people have slowly (but insanely fast in geological terms) been programmed that our neighbor is just out to get us.\n\nNeighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore.  Everyone just stays in their house and works themselves to the bone.  We no longer have time to get out and meet our neighbors and add new friends to our existence because we are so busy trying to make ends meet, pay off medical debt, pay off student loan debt, or just plain old credit card debt that we shouldn't have been granted in the first place.\n\nDid you know that there was a time when you had to have excellent credit to get a credit card with $1,000 limit?  Now they hand that shit out like spiked fucking candy!\n\nEdit: spelling",

After a month I was still sick and coughed blood a few times so I said alright, I guess I should get it checked out.\n\nI look up my plan, see that urgent care is $25 for non-emergency visits, cheaper than a regular doctor, and probably faster. I pick on my plan says is in my network and go.\n\nI get there and after giving them all my info they come back and tell me that their system says it'll be $50 but that that's actually not correct, it's actually $75 (the price on my plan for emergency urgent care visits). I tell her neither of those should be right and show her my healthcare plan. She says well you have to pay this now and if it's different your insurance will reimburse you. So I pay up bc im concerned with the blood.\n\nDoc asks about 5 questions, does a quick checkup and to tells me its just a viral infection, nothing to do but over the counter meds (he was right i got better soon after).\n\nSo it cost me $75 for practically nothing and my insurance never reimbursed me and the healthcare system is so fucking confusing i have no idea where they pull these prices from. I ended up not being able to get to work that week bc I didnt have money for gas after and that caused me to be behind on rent the next pay-cycle since I didnt have an incoming check.\n\nSorry for the rant, I hate this country.",

But when he moved out of Houston to take care of his dying mother in another state, he had no job, and while he was waiting and applying for government assistance programs, he ran out of his insulin. He tried to set up a GoFundMe page, but didn't make enough (he was only $50 short) before he died. \n\nI wish I had known he was in trouble. I didn't know anything about his situation until I heard he had died. If nothing else, I would have suggested he go to the nearest ER or hospital, and they would have saved his life. \n\nShane was an artist, a \"zine\" fest organizer, a writer, and easily one of the kindest people I have ever met. A lifelong fan of the Peanuts comic strip, his biggest dream was to work at the Charles Schultz someday. I still can't believe we lost him. \n\nBernie Sanders now uses Shane's life as an example of how we need to change healthcare in America.\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shane-patrick-boyle-died-after-starting-a-gofundme-campaign-for-insulin/",

I take about 8 pills a day, every day, and this is after about two years of tweaking and refining my medications with my doctors so we can cut back as much as possible on that amount. \n\nFor all of them combined, I pay about $20 a month if I had to take a wild guess. It's a low enough figure that I don't actually bother to include it in my budgeting spreadsheets. I'm glad that a small part of America is having a small part of its healthcare system be improved on, but $100 a month for insulin is absurdly high enough that I can't really fit it into my frame of reference. \n\nThe American healthcare system disgusts me, and it breaks my heart that people suffer so harshly from it.",

My best friend went into a diabetic seizure. I ran. \n\nLater that day, having gotten her to the hospital and stabilized, the band directors and the nurse returned during afternoon practice. The nurse pulled me aside and told me I had saved my friends life by getting her when I did. I\u2019d do it again 3 months later in Toronto, this time by knowing the signs and not to fuck around. \n\nDiabetes doesn\u2019t fuck around.

Now that I\u2019m moved out of the house and have to pay my own bills, I\u2019ve just come to realize how ridiculously expensive insulin has become. We had a payroll change at work and I was uninsured for just about a month without realizing it. Went to go pick up a 1-month supply of insulin, and the lady tells me my insurance isn\u2019t going through. \n\nMe: \u201cOh, that\u2019s ok, I\u2019ll look into that. Can you tell me how much it would be without insurance?\u201d\n\nLady: \u201c$957.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c......\u201d\n\nLady: \u201c...............\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c....I\u2019ll skip the insulin this time, thanks.\u201d\n\nLike seriously. There\u2019s been nearly a 300% rise in insulin cost over the past decade or so. For the exact same product. Nothing has changed. I\u2019m back on work insurance now so they cover most of it, but I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for people without insurance.",

At that point a child very well could have gained enough tolerance(though age or treatment) to not need it.\n\nSo, even in US where they can cost $600, it is $600 every several years for many people.

He's been involved in some controversies, which, take this with a grain of salt because I can't remember too well (and will correct if someone can suggest otherwise) but I believe he had both a racial discrimination suit against him and was dodging taxes or something like that. He was a little Trump-ish in a way, just not really a horrible compulsively lying sociopathic asshole way. Just some general rich guy stuff. \n\nHe ran on a *fairly* progressive platform that made people, especially being in Illinois, go *ssuuuuuuuure*. But he's followed through with a ton of them. Legalized weed almost lickity split, expunged a shitload of weed criminal records, legalized sports gambling, wants to end mandatory minimums for prison sentences, trying to push for abortion rights protections, among other things. He's also been pushing super hard on a progressive tax to make the rich pay more, since Illinois is only one of like....6 states I believe with a flat tax\n\nI'm sure more people on here from Illinois could fill you in on him more. I still don't really trust him, but I'm pretty happy with the results so far",

Frankly, nobody liked him, and his own unpopularity led to the democrats gaining supermajorities in both houses.\n\nBut any probably could have done that. What he also did was dump $170m into his campaign to run a cutting edge campaign never seen before. During the Governor debates, the Pritzker campaign was cutting soundbites and pushing them out as ads *during the debate*.\n\nNow, with the aforementioned supermajorites and money, the Democratic machine run by Madigan really couldn't say no to his policy proposals. It helped that Madigan has held back progressive legislation because the Chicago Chamber of Commerce and Clubs for Growth has been against it, and has been one of the biggest supporters of the Democratic party until...4 years ago when they went all in for Rauner. Madigan is a true politician. You going against him, and you can go fuck yourself.\n\nSo a lot of new legislation came up, and got passed. However, somebody on the Prtizker team knows politics, and has been advising him all along. Most professional politicos in the state have remarked how eerie it isn't he hasn't made any real missteps - hasn't gotten into high profile pissing matches, hasn't stepped on the toes of Madigan or Lightfort (Chicago Mayor) in public, and has seemed to work as a smooth career politician when he has not. Contrast with Lightfoot, who has been winning a lot of moral victories, and not doing so hot on others (see Chicago casino).\n\nSo what has he done in a year?\n\n* Got a budget passed that at least addressed current spending\n\n* Passed recreational marijuana through a legislature (1st in US)\n\n* Had automatic expungement in said marijuana law for anything under 30? grams\n\n* Has a social equity in said marijuana law that requires new recreational companies to have a large minority stake in ownership\n\n* Has created a fund that those license applications for recreational dispensaries (200k) in Chicago, a part goes to economic initiatives in those neighborhoods hit the hardest by the War on Drugs\n\n* Passed a $45b capital bill, the first in a decade. Lots of new taxes in it, but raised the gas tax to what it would have been with inflation (last raised in 94 to 0.19/gallon, raised to 0.38/gallon) and indexed it to inflation, helping our infrastructure.\n\n* Passed a resolution getting the progressive tax on the referendum in November (needs 60% though to pass)\n\n* Passed a mimumum wage increase - was 8.25; will raise to 15 dollars by 2025\n\n* Signed a bill repealing the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, which penalizes doctors for performing abortions considered unnecessary, and the Partial-birth Abortion Ban Act.\n\n* Increased K-12 funding by $379m, Community College by $14m, and University by $53m\n\n* Raised age to buy tobacco products to 21\n\n* Signed an executive order  requiring schools across the state to be \"affirming and inclusive\" of transgender and non-binary students\n\n* Had Donald Trump not ever look at him in during the New Governor Meet and Greet at the Whitehouse. There's video. It's awkward. Common theory is DJT felt insecure because of how much money Pritzker is worth. \n\n* Generally hit all the progressive talking points. \n\n\nWhat hasn't he done?\n\n* Reduced ISP processing times for FOID Cards (still  6 month behind, though if you reapply before deadline your card is still valid)\n\n* Ethics reform (Yikes)\n\n* Unfucked DCFS. It's...I can't do it justice. Essentially they kept getting positions cut, so staff just took the route of least resistance and cut corners. With children. At least one who was kept in an abusive home and died becasue of it. Then there was the \"chaining kids in vans to transport them for 12+ hours\" since they only could spare a driver. \n\n* Have a real plan to deal with backlogs of bills ($6billion, I think?)\n\n* Have a real plan to deal with pension obligations. Besides raising taxes to meet them. \n\n\nI'd say more good than bad, but he's been in office for a year, so we'll see.",

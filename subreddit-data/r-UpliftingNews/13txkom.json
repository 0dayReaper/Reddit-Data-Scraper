The Conservation out there is really interesting and one mistake can really ruin what you need to achieve.\n\nSo for example. They decided to habituate gorillas for tourism thus making them more valuable to the people in the area and hopefully reduce poaching. The downside is that we share 98% dna with gorillas so we can pass diseases on to them. This is just one example of how difficult it can be to keep our environment safe in these tough times.",

Western media and environmentalism plays up poaching and the presence of indigenous peoples, but goes to great lengths to hide the fact that gorillas and many other species are endangered because their environments are being destroyed for agricultural land, strip mining, etc. If this is mentioned at all, it is placed squarely on the local people, and not the western governments that force these neocolonized nations to exploit their environments to produce cash crops and rare earth minerals for cheap for western corporations.\n\nThen what remaining natural environments exist, they concern troll about indigenous peoples. These park rangers are trained to commit genocide and horrible atrocities to force indigenous off the land to make western environmentalists feel better and so that wealthy, western tourists can come look at the gorillas. All under the guise of \"fighting poachers.\" If you look into the history of these parks, you'll find a direct link from European colonization. Germany was literally sending former Nazis to these parks to train and administer these parks in the brutalizing of indigenous peoples. The national parks in the Congo were literally administered by the descendants of the former Belgian governor of colonized Congo, who like their ancestor, committed terrible crimes on the Congolese. It's a long tradition in western environmentalism where they did the same to the national parks in the US, then they wonder why they're always on fire after they genocided the indigenous that were maintaining those environments.",

I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s run now, but at the time, you had to purchase a trekking permit well in advance, and only a handful were sold for each day. We were led by a park ranger guide, who was extremely careful to be sure we kept a good distance away from the animals, even when some of the young gorillas tried to approach us out of curiosity.  Stunning animals in their lush gorgeous habitat.",

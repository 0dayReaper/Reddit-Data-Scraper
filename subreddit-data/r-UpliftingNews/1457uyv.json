There are inspections but only after people report possible animal abuse, it's in the news regularly.\n\n\nMore people want cats to be indoors only, outside on a leash though it might take a few years before there are laws for that, it's a public debate basically maybe until ten years ago nobody was talking about it. Only nothing on sterilization or licenses/required exams, yet.",

You could argue its more humane for the cat but what about the dozens of birds, rabbits, and mice it'll kill for fun in its life? No, trap and either adopt or euthanize I'll never support releasing an invasive predator into the wild.",

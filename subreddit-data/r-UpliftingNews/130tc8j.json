My mom quit after a nasty bout of pneumonia that the doctors said would probably reoccur if she kept smoking. She had several grandkids (including one of my kids) in diapers at the time, and she told me she'd be damned if she was going to let her nasty habit keep her from seeing them grow up. She kicked it, and now she's going strong with no respiratory problems since. I'm very proud of my parents.",

It fucking sucked because they both survived their first ordeals. My grandma saw my grandpa struggling to learn to walk again and still kept smoking. Just as soon as my grandpa was able to get into the shower on his own, a second stroke hit. He died in hospice a few months later. It was a struggle to see him unable to do anything for himself, but it gave us all a chance to say goodbye to him.\n\nMy grandma found out about her embolism and survived with it for quite a while. When the clot fully hit, it nearly gave my dad his own stroke, and the EMTs that were there for her also had to check on him (she moved in with my parents).  She lived in the hospital for less than a week after that, and I wasn't able to travel to say goodbye to her because my son was due to be born any day, that week. I spoke to her over the phone and told her that I was having a boy, what his name was going to be, and that I received her gift just in time. She could only make some noises in response, but I know she understood everything. \n\nDamn. It's amazing how much I bury traumatic things to keep moving. This all just happened with my grandma this past November. She might have not smoked for over a year when she passed.",

I was reading about the big vaping researches over 20 years ago in Europe and the 20 year studies released showing a huge benefit over cold turkey quitters. I was smoking for 22 years tried to quit over 9 times and it wasn't until I found nick salt pens that I was actually able to quit. The doctors even said to me that I had reversed so much damage I wasn't even emphysemic anymore. They literally prescribe vape pens to emphysema patients in Europe where most of this technology was developed under cancer research grants.\n\nBig tobaccos last push is to make people think vaping is dangerous or as bad as smoking. \n\nIt's not better than doing nothing but smoking and breathing in the carcinogenic chemicals is what causes the extreme rates of cancer and emphysema. Only deaths ever attributed to vaping are from Phillip Morris using banned for cigarettes menthol additives. I am now backing off of my nicotine strengths and will finally be able to quit nicotine altogether. \n\nTruth campaign is using tobacco company propaganda which they spent over a billion dollars propping up and the anti vaping campaign PR. Even has democrats taking money from RJ Reynolds and Phillip Morris now. Still like the smell of cigarettes and when I smoke one it just makes me feel like shit the next morning coughing uncontrollably in to the shower. \n\nVaping is killing the tobacco industry and requires so much less tobacco to be farmed. Kids are going to be rebels at least if they vape the medical and long term life effects will be less severe. Stopping stupid kids will take more hope for their futures and less emotional abandonment issues at home.",

There were never stories of kids smoking in the bathrooms when I was in middle school, but vaping in the bathrooms is a constant issue now. \n\nThe net improvement in smoking is amazing. I have loved ones who developed cancer as a result of smoking. It's a horrible habit. I'm glad that smoking has gone down so much.

Better rates of quitting by far and way lower rates of lung cancer. The other 20 year study showed no correlated or causative affects for second hand vape.

Sure you can also make friends without drinking, but you have to push yourself much harder instead of it happening naturally, if social anxiety is stopping you from pushing yourself, then using alcohol to help those symptoms isn\u2019t very different from doing amphetamines to help with ADHD symptoms.",

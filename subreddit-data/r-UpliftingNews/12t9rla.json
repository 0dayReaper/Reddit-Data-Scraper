Hispanics found it great and loved it, however every person who knew nothing of the culture said he was appropriating Mexican culture, which based on individuals who are of that culture they thought he was doing a great job.\n\nI honestly believe a majority of people who are trying to dress in attire that is from another culture aren't doing it to be malicious but because they want to be a part of something that they may not understand the significance behind and instead of trying to educate those people on why it maybe a bad thing it's become oh you're culturally appropriating.\n\nI had no idea the Seminole tribe gave their blessing to Florida state University but this makes me want to become more educated on topics like this.",

One commentor went berserk how they were offended by his use of the word gypsy, and a white person can't have a tattoo respresenting their culture. \n\nI pointed out that it may have an offensive meaning in one part of the world, but it can be a neutral word meaning in other places (like Black instead of African American). OP and I were downvoted by people who wanted to show solidarity than discuss the contents of what I said.\n\nHilariously, 2 weeks ago some other post had a random tattoo that was credited by a Tattoo shop in Spain that had Gypsy in the name, and that had a lot of positive messages.\n\nSo in the span of 2 weeks, suddenly everyone decided to revision history as if the word in question was always offensive and I am the crazy one for having a differing opinion.",

If it\u2019s done with the reverence it deserves then maybe, but those who are being represented should have the final say. Indians are a title Europeans gave to the indigenous people in the Americas. Indians are actually from India the way Europeans are from Europe and Russians from Russia.

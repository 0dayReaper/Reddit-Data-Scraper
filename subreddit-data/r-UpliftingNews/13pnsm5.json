And create more high-paying govt jobs that will force private industry to raise wages. Conservatives argue that lower-class people should just work harder and get a high-paying job but we all know that those jobs are competitive, meaning scarce.",

That's why the government is meant to tax and regulate. Corporations and the owner class dodge tax and extract wealth via litigious mechanisms that politicians are happy to leave open. Look at non-dom status in the UK, a loophole the PM himself was exploiting.\n\nSo you have those with all the power ensuring that the maximum possible value is extracted from the other 99% of us, and then we don't get libraries or teacher's salaries in exchange. That's extractive. We live in the wrong portion of the spreadsheet.",

No one is trying to remove the incentive to work or decrease growth. \n\nOur systemic poverty issues originate from disproportionate and stratified distribution of income, which results from a lack of leverage workers typically experience during wage negotiations. This imbalance of leverage allows ownership to collect the vast majority of revenue generated by the workers without paying an adequate living wage to them, forcing them onto government social programs. \n\nWe've systemically propped-up this imbalance of leverage between workers and employers through decades of anti-union, supply-side, and trickle-down economic policy. And Citizens United only allows our corrupt corporate lobbying system to lobby for even MORE rigged economic policy that benefits the rich at the expense of the working people.\n\nThe people you disagree with are not trying to destroy your beloved capitalism and free markets and private ownership. We are trying to save it, by making it more accessible to everybody.",

So many can\u2019t afford basic medical care and healthy food. \n\nBillionaires and corporations could use their influence to lobby for basic worker rights to ensure that workers are protected, have adequate paid time off and that everyone has access to necessary medical and mental treatments and preventative care. They could could pay their workers legitimate living wages that kept up with inflation and share their profits with every worker\u2026 what\u2019s that? If they did they wouldn\u2019t be necessarily be quite a billionaire? Oh\u2026 maybe we should tax them at a higher rate so some if that insane wealth is used in more positive ways than just hoarded and used to lobby for the opposite of any sort if greater good. \n\nWe see how it works now, and the way it is going is too few have too much.

That they\u2019ll in turn be able to provide their own house to themselves as a business expense and write that off as a loss against their gains to further reduce taxes. Those blocky Mercedes cars are a dead giveaway that someone has just dipped their toes into this game as it\u2019s almost always owned by their personal company not themselves as a vehicle for the business. Each person will have several different entities responsible for covering different aspects of their lives the reduce exposure and further convolute the income stream.

You\u2019re acting like we\u2019d be flipping a switch from freedom for all to taking everyone\u2019s money. Taxes are vital to a functioning society and help prevent the rich and powerful from using their money and power to take everything for themselves and leave little for everyone else. This is about adjusting a line, tweaking some settings, to get our society in a better place. \n\nOur wealth inequality has gotten so bad that it\u2019s pretty much on par with corrupt countries like Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Zimbabwe. Our friendly ally countries do a much better job of spreading the wealth. We\u2019re the richest country in the world but hardly anybody feels like it aside from a few thousand people at the very top. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. \n\nTaxing them heavily will still leave them incredibly rich but we can take that money and help out everyone else, so we can have just one parent working full time, they can go on vacations, have a nice house and cars, eat good quality food, do a better job raising their kids and enjoying time together. Yeah some people are fortunate enough to have that now but many do not. If you don\u2019t see that as a problem then you\u2019re just out of touch. \n\nHow many problems would better financial security alleviate? How many divorces, poor child-raising, depressions, suicides, abortions, general crime, etc? How many people are scared to go to the doctor because they don\u2019t want to be financially ruined? You have absolutely no reason to defend the rich on this other than vague ideas about what you think is fair that is probably just propaganda you\u2019ve been fed by the rich-controlled media and politicians.",

In my mind it encourages kids to look up things they don't know (which under privileged children have less access too) vs just being able to recite it back.

For example, a child knows the word \u201cconvict\u201d verbally, but not in writing, and if they do not know how to sound the word out, it could mess up the way they comprehend the text. The way people are teaching reading without phonics causes students to skip over words or replace the word with something close to it. For example, maybe their brain replaces \u201cconvict\u201d with \u201cconvinced\u201d because the words kind of look similar. It would ruin the way they understand the text. \n\nBut, sounding out the word can help a child determine if they know the word verbally or not. It also helps understand affixes, which are like common roots of words like \u201cbio,\u201d which expands a child\u2019s vocabulary just by knowing what the root means.",

I'm pretty sure my learning to read was something of a mix. But phonics absolutely took precedence as much of kindergarten was spent learning the individual noises of individual letters. 1st grade was my reading breakthrough as I realized how these letters combined to form other noises that became recognizable words. Now, I do vaguely remember assignments showing a picture of an object, and having to name that object by writing the word down, which is a sort of \"whole word\" approach. But those assignments tended to not be helpful, as I had previously learned the majority of those words... just by talking? I knew what an apple was and what it was called well before learning to read. The eureka moment was learning the symbols for the \"a\" sound, the \"p\" sound, the \"l\" sound, and what an \"e\" can do at the end of those words, and realizing the noise I just made sounds like \"apple\". The Whole Word approach just sounds like something that naturally happens in conversation and should never be seen as a replacement to phonics.",

Younger generations are supposedly reading more than older generations (although usually this is \"read a book in the past month\" or \"past year\" and students have almost assuredly read a book recently). \n\nThis also gets weird with defining reading. Younger people tend to read news online instead of watching TV or reading newspapers. But do you count reading Wikipedia or reading magazines as \"real\" reading?\n\nApparently Gen X (41-55) is also the most likely to use e-books but everyone prefers paper books over e-books, regardless of age.",

Online lending and e-books let me read as much as I want anyways, since I always have my books on my phone for whenever I have time on the bus, a quiet moment at work, etc. and have a new book ready whenever I finish an old one. I'm a big fan of audiobooks, too, but that's something you probably frown on even more....",

I really don't get this reflexive \"technology bad, kids these days don't appreciate paper and ink like we used to\" thing.",

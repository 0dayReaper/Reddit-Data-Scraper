Children are taught about Abraham sacrificing Isaac, and parents tell their kids \"sure, if God told me to, I'd kill you.\" \n\nRuth and Boaz is taught from toddlerhood. David and Solomon with their hundreds of wives and concubines. David being glorified for killing \"his tens of thousands\". It's like glorifying Hitler but add in 300 wives and 700 concubines. Why? Oh yeah, because wives (you know, ***human beings***) and children are GIFTS FROM GOD TO MEN. \n\nFrom newborn on up, boys are taught that women belong to men. Girls are taught that if they get raped, it's their fault for being \"a stumbling block\" to boys/men, who are ravening, mindless sex-beasts, incapable of self-control if they see one extra centimeter of female flesh.\n\nThen we're all supposed to be like surprised Pikachu face when all the school shooters writing manifestos about how they're ***entitled*** to have a woman are, wait for it, wait for it... Raised by Christians. \n\nIt's okay to tell children from birth that women are not really people, but instead just vending machines popping out babies for \"good Christian men,\" and divorcing your violent husband makes you worthless garbage... And that if a girl gets raped it's her fault...\n\nBut god forbid we say anything like, it's okay to be gay and it's found all over in nature. I mean, that won't lead to school shootings so probably better keep it mum.",

A wife can't consent! That's blasphemy! Her body belongs to Jesus and then her husband. How shameful to think she has a right to say no!! A daughter's virginity is her father's to \"protect\" and give away. How dare she think SHE owns it!\n\nOf course consent is confusing to people who don't believe in it and carefully teach against it!\n\nWhich is very confusing for others. \"What do you mean we welcome pedos!? Children can't consent, obviously that's wrong, DUH!\"\n\nThey really don't realize Christianity is anti consent so naturally your comment is confusing AF.",

But that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re good people.\n\nNo. Nazis aren\u2019t people. People deserve various fundamental rights and privileges. Nazis deserve exactly what they got in WW2",

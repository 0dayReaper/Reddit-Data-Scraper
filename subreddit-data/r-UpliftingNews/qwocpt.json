Agco just made theirs inaccessible unless you register at a dealer first. I think the common sentiment trumpeted online misses the point and often embellishes to a great extent what repair options are available. The real encumbrance to owners is the need for ServiceADVISOR to reprogram control modules. Although there are third party tools like TEXA that can do most of what ServiceADVISOR in the context of dealer diagnostics, you need ServiceADVISOR and a valid account to download the software payloads. In the context of other tractor manufacturers I believe they are all quite similar when considering the common brands (Agco, CNH, Deere &amp; Company) in that a proprietary diagnostic computer is needed if you want to reprogram control modules. The above said, owners can do a great deal of repair to machines without needing a diagnostic computer. Check out western truck and tractor repair on youtube for a third party repair guy, or ZK master tech for a dealer tech.",

Farmers are so much smarter than the average Redditor, despite our perception of the reverse. \n\nMy general complaint is that our land usage system either allows people to do something at nearly zero cost, or prohibits such a plan altogether. There is no intermediate where costs associated with environmental damage is assessed to the user which would allow capitalism to work its magic. \n\nFarmer and ranching is both a critical part to our modern lifestyle, along with one of the most damaging things we do to the environment. Politicians don\u2019t have the courage to propose nuanced approaches as they are held back by a sacred worship of this segment, unable to have even the slightest criticism.",

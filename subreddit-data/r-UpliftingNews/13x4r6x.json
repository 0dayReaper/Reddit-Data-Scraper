Quite the opposite, and that misapprehension is killing people.\n\nThe \"danger\" of mammograms was false positives. In the majority of cases, the \"danger\" of false positives was an \"unnecessary\" ultrasound (meaning it cost the insurance companies money) and \"undue stress\" for the patient (i.e., the head, so pretty, so little, don't worry it, prettier when you smile.) Sometimes it led to biopsies or very very rarely lumpectomy. I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a negative biopsy or even surgery than undetected cancer.\n\nSome more details here, but it was a huge mistake and they're trying to take it back. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/new-guidelines-recommend-earlier-mammograms-amid-rise-in-breast-cancer-among-younger-women",

Few people need to hear during an office visit that they should lose weight - physicians should spend more time supporting programs that make systemic changes to our food supply, to creating green spaces, to allowing people to have time to be active instead of barely surviving on 3 part time jobs while being able to afford the cheapest McDonald\u2019s meal rather than a whole real food from a supermarket. We have a systemic problem around obesity in this country not a knowledge gap (for most ). The people you see on shows like \u201cmy 600 pound life\u201d are outliers .  As someone that has come from poverty to being middle class- quality food and time to exercise are luxuries  for many. Americas food supply is set up in a way where crap food is cheaper than fresh food.anyway I went off in a big tangent/ average woman visit a doctor doesn\u2019t need to hear that she needs to lose weight- she had a mirror and she has seen what the media considers normal.",

Fast forward to surgery and they open me up and wouldn't you know it. In the surgeons word it was \"bad. Very bad.\" On the upper end of worst she'd ever seen. And after the surgery holy shit. Sex is meant to feel like THIS?? Periods are meant to feel like THAT??

With all the other organs, intestines, liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, kidneys.  \n  \nThese organs are at risk of being STRANGLED TO DEATH by the creeping endometrial tissue, which CONTRACTS AND SQUEEZES during the menstrual cycle!!!!

Personally, I think it's poor writing, not ill intent, in this case, but it raised my hackles too.\n\nEDIT: Er, on second thought, fertility is clearly the lead researcher's  priority:\n\n&gt; Thirty years ago, we treated all breast cancers the same,\" he said.\n\n&gt; \"We now know there are many different types of breast cancer and treat them accordingly.\n\n&gt; \"By knowing the type of endometriosis, we will be able to predict whether a patient is likely to experience an aggressive, invasive form of the disease and offer treatment to preserve her fertility,\" she said. [Pronoun switch ibid.]\n\nThis is not \"who will get relief from which hormone treatment\" or even \"who is more likely to benefit from rationed surgery\" but \"whose baby factory is in peril.\" Yuck.",

            "comment": "I wish that the focus of this research was less on fertility and more on quality of life. I (32f) just had my uterus removed because of endometriosis 2 weeks ago. The prior 17 years have been spent in debilitating pain whether I am having a period or not. I have spent thousands of dollars on pain medications and have caused quite a bit of permanent damage to my liver. Nobody really paid me much attention because I have never wanted children. Chronic pain was not as important as reproducing. It's a sad statement of our medical system when women are institutionally downgraded to a human factory line only. \n\nFrom ChatGPT:\n\n*While significant progress has been made in understanding and treating endometriosis, it is true that the field still faces challenges and further research is needed. Several factors have contributed to the relatively limited research and slower progress in the field of endometriosis:*\n\n*1. Complexity of the condition: Endometriosis is a complex and multifactorial condition with varying symptoms and manifestations. It can affect different organs and tissues, and its underlying causes are not yet fully understood. This complexity poses challenges in accurately diagnosing the condition, studying its mechanisms, and developing targeted treatments.*\n\n*2. Lack of awareness and understanding: Endometriosis historically has been underdiagnosed, misunderstood, and stigmatized. Many women and healthcare providers may not be fully aware of the condition or its impact on quality of life. Limited awareness can result in delayed diagnosis, inadequate access to care, and less emphasis on research funding.*\n\n*3. Funding and research prioritization: Research funding for endometriosis has traditionally been limited compared to other medical conditions. The allocation of research funds is often influenced by factors such as prevalence, public health impact, and perceived scientific priorities. Despite its high prevalence and significant burden, endometriosis has not received proportionate research investment.*\n\n*4. Diagnostic challenges: Diagnosing endometriosis definitively currently requires a surgical procedure called laparoscopy, which can be invasive and costly. The lack of non-invasive and accurate diagnostic methods has hindered large-scale epidemiological studies and clinical trials.*\n\n*5. Lack of standardized treatment guidelines: The management of endometriosis is complex and highly individualized, depending on factors such as symptom severity, disease stage, and fertility goals. The absence of universally accepted treatment guidelines and standardized protocols has resulted in variations in clinical practice and challenges in conducting comparative studies.*\n\n*6. Biological research complexities: Studying endometriosis at a molecular and cellular level is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining tissue samples and replicating the disease in laboratory models. Research in the field requires collaboration between different disciplines, including gynecology, immunology, genetics, and bioinformatics.*\n\n*Despite these challenges, there has been a growing recognition of the need for increased research efforts in endometriosis. Organizations, advocacy groups, and researchers are working towards raising awareness, improving funding opportunities, and fostering collaboration to advance understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of endometriosis.*\n\n*It is important to note that progress is being made, and there are ongoing research initiatives focused on unraveling the mechanisms of endometriosis, improving diagnostics, and developing targeted therapies. Continued support, advocacy, and research investment are essential to drive further advancements in the field and improve the lives of individuals affected by endometriosis.*",

You stop eating around 3pm) and taking Berberine capsules. After a few years of pain, confusion, and periods sometimes lasting 6+ months, I\u2019ve had a normal period for 6 months, no meds. Thanks for nothing, medical system!\n\nWomen\u2019s health care is a joke.

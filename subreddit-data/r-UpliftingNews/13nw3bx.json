But with a surf board and lessons, I felt like i was 1 with the earth. Riding a wave felt like being on top of the world (at sea level) LOL\n\nclimbing is great too! My sister rock climbs and she has nicer arms that 99% of the people that workout at my gym.",

Putting your hand on the mountain as you carve big turns feels oddly natural. \n\nFWIW - learning to juggle was similar - an unnatural act that felt amazing once you got a feel",

I'm mongo on a skateboard, which doesn't work on a chairlift at all, so I fell in the damn lift line a couple times. catching backside edges and fell on lame green runs - steeper was better to force using the edge.  Was pretty bruised up, as expected but just went straight to a board the next time.  \n\nI was the only person who could turn both directions without falling when they broke us up at a 1/2 day group lesson, so I got a solo lesson for cheap.  I had to get my position corrected since it was TOTALLY wrong (was leaning back and trying to kick the tail around, like a slalom water ski).  once I learned to bend that back knee and get the weight up front and let the board turn, I was backsiding easily.  Guy told me I was the first person he'd taken to the top of the mountain to ski the black down who'd started in the beginner class (but he could have just been looking for a tip).\n\nI still don't like flat hauling ass on a board, there's no quick releases, and you get get salmon slapped when you catch an edge and speed.  no bueno.  I also suck in moguls more than I suck on skis, because the turns aren't the right size.",

Everything melts away and feels so small when you are just a dot bobbing in the ocean. \n\nI also just love how when that wave hits you your mind just goes blank, you go into a flow state and just let it take you. As someone with an overactive, anxious mind, those moments of blankness are very welcome.",

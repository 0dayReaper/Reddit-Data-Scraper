The perfect solution was the Disney cruise as she could take frequent breaks to lay down when needed.  They were so amazing and accommodating to us.  She was on a feeding tube by that point and just completely made everything truly easy and magical.  My daughter got to meet Dumbo!",

They brought the kid to the show that night with special seating, tons of merch, the works. It was incredible. What shocked me was about three years later, when WWE happened to be in town again, and Cena's team reached out to see how my student was doing and if he wanted to \"catch up\" with John. My kid was thrilled - he got to meet him again and see the show that night. He was so excited that John Cena remembered his name and everything. \n\nI'm sure this is **someone's** job on his team - keeping track of the kids he's met in which places and everything - but I couldn't believe all they did for my little guy, even years later. It was mind-blowing.",

A number of them are in some form of child based careers. My younger brother went to a private school where John's cousin (sibling of the cousin/wrestler who was on Cena's rap CD) was a teacher. My brother got SO much merchandise over the school year. John would sign belts/cds/etc for her, and she'd use them as rewards when kids got high marks. I think at least one belt bro had was the result of his perfect attendance.",

Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that).\n\nAnyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but we\u2019d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we\u2019ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you\u2019d like while you\u2019re in town.\u201d My sister and cousin were both like \u201cYeah that\u2019s cool.\u201d and I kind of played the asshole a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t understand. We\u2019ve been here for 15 minutes - we\u2019ve just ordered. Can\u2019t we finish our meal here?\u201d\n\nThen out of nowhere John Cena shows up next to the manager and says \u201cPaul, these guys can finish. We\u2019ll be at the bar. I got some time.\u201d\n\nAnd I (being a big Cena fan) said \u201cOh wow, uh\u2026 I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.\u201d\n\nJohn was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, John Cena and I made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents.",

For example I doubt Nic Cage gets the chance to fulfil 27 wishes in his lifetime.\n\nEdit: Turns out his name is Nic not Nick \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f",

And many realise that him being made into WWE's Superman at the expense of their own favourites is because to many he IS a real life Superman.\n\nAnd it's also why he never once turned back to being a bad guy in WWE after being their top guy. He would upset too many children, and also from their point of view (and his too) they make WAY too much money from him to turn him.\n\nOn top of that, the die hard fans have also softened because lately he seems to have made amends by taking some very high profile losses to make up for the ones he should have taken, including letting The Undertaker squash him (wrestling term for destroying him very quickly) at Wrestle mania.\n\nAlso, he's just entertaining as fuck when they hand him a live microphone",

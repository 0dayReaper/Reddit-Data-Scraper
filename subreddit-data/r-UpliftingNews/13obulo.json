It inputs and outputs a bit of carbon every year as trees grow/die, but the net carbon stored stays about the same. \n\nThe earth is covered with ideal sites for these facilities but unfortunately they are usually also ideal for growing grain and corn, so legacy facilities are chopped/burned down to make room for more grain.\n\n80% of land used in this way goes to livestock, mainly cows. The other 20% of land creates all the rest of humans food (close to 75 of our food is created by that 20%!)",

Come to an actual stop at stop signs (and moat yield signs for that matter), when a light turns yellow, come to a stop instead of speeding up and trying to blast through last second, make sure there is plenty of stopping distance between you and the person in front of you (two second rule), drive within the speed limit, even if no one is around, don't overdrive your visibility at night or in fog.\n\nAnd if it helps any, I used to drive super aggressively.   I stopped primarily because I basically realized that I wasn't getting anywhere any faster.  At best I shaved like a minute off my trip.  Unless you are driving for like 10 hours straight, driving super aggressive doesn't save a significant amount of time and just makes you a huge danger to everyone.",

Congratulations you almost caused multiple accident and saved 1 second.\n\nBeing 1 minute late or 5 minute late is never worth anyone\u2019s life or the amount of time you will waste dealing with tow trucks, insurance, police tickets etc After playing the \u201ccan I beat google estimated time\u201d multiple times, found out that even if I speed and think I\u2019m going fast, it really just shaves a minute off if I\u2019m lucky.

Most of the US has been built around car usage, so Americans end up having to drive a lot. If the US had better mass transit, better walkability, and stricter rules about who is allowed to drive, it would reduce total miles driven as well as total traffic fatalities.\n\n&gt;More drivers, driving more, in a smaller area, with less driving education; makes it unsafe.\n\nI think you've got part of that backwards: higher population density generally makes people less dependent on automobiles. The fact that Norway has achieved such low miles driven in spite of having a far lower population density than the USA only makes it more impressive.",

Republicans use culture wars to enrage their base so that their base does not notice what it is republicans actually do: fleece money from them and openly embrace corruption/bribes in the government while serving only the wealthiest individuals in the country. \n\nIt's been their playbook for about 35 years now.  The only thing that is now different is that republicans have a much harder time muddying the waters and pretending they are moderate when they are not.  What they are has become crystal clear to most people.",

It's the shit they're not being outright about that casts a much more ominous shadow.

They know social issues are much more readily defended and cared about than, say, specific economic issues. \"Oh let's put up this bullshit ban on drag story time, that's the new hot button issue, so people won't notice this little bill over here quietly lowering and exempting taxes for billionaires.\"",

While they may very well be doing trickle-down bullshit as well, this culture war is very different.\n\nStates like Florida, Tennessee and Texas have been turned into hell on Earth for queer people by design.

Trans people and their families are being turned into refugees within this country.\n\nThis isn't just diversionary anymore - it's a crusade of hate.

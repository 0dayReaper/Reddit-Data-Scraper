Fungi also respire, so some of the captured carbon is being re-released.\n\nMaybe instead of a bunch of what-ifs that might make some tiny improvement if we invest tons of research money, we stop clear cutting and burning existing forests where these systems already exist. But I guess there's not as much money in preserving existing environments as the is in harvesting what you can, then pretending you're rebuilding it like it was.",

Probably off by a long shot, if I'm being honest, I doubt it's even 1%, all things considered.. Who's to say tens of thousands of mushroom species completely capable of a last of us-esque cataclysm haven't been evolved and subsequently died out in some cave somewhere? The end of the human race could have been eaten to extinction by a small group of blind, pale lizards a couple kilometers underground, beneath NYC or Tokyo last week at 4am and we'd never fucking know that we just dodged a few billion zombies while we were dreaming lol\n\n\"that's impossible!\" no, you just havent discovered it yet. Existence is a big place",

This is the fungal network that travels underground and links with plant roots unless I'm mistaken. \n\nThe plants take CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it into carbon, and when their roots and rhizomes die or slough off biomass the fungus eats them. At that point the oxygen is gone and the carbon is actually sequestered underground.",

The good thing, which is also the bad thing, is that plastic lasts forever which we want for things we want to last for a long time. Thankfully we've made strides to find alternatives to single use plastic, we just need to convince people the money is more than worth it, but for the stuff we want to last we really dont need a whole lot of oil for. Not sure how much, but it would definitely be reduced.\n\nLol isnt there someone working on making fungi foam for packaging actually?",

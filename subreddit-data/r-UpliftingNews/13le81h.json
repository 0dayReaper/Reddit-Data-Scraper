Sure socialised health systems can be a little slower at times, but you must look at the UK's NHS and think \"sure we can do that, maybe even better\"",

As if this POS is in a position to be any kind of moral agent, when they are doing so much damage to earth, society, and humans personally, merely for the sake of their own fragile ego.\n\nBut as long as the biggest influences in politics are driven by the size of the their capital, humans will always be second grade citizens to corporations. And corporations are really just ghouls hiding behind company names, so the company gets punished instead of them when they go out of their ways to make your life worse.",

In fact, a 2019 study showed the median US family spend $76 / year out of pocket on EpiPens. (See here, sadly paywalled: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35819685/ )\n\nThe copay for low income patients on Medicaid is $0\n\nThe cash price approaches $700, but that will apply to very few people (less than 10% of US adults are uninsured) \n\nNot saying this is good - the out of pocket price of an EpiPen should be ZERO DOLLARS. There is no reason to ever require a copay for epipens. \n\nBut it\u2019s just not true that $700 is anywhere near what patients actually pay.",

A couple $700 epipens a year should be ok right?\n\nTo put it in perspective, the Canadian government negotiates a price with Pfizer to ship and sell epipens in Canada.  At $120 Cdn / unit.  Which, were it not profitable, Pfizer would be free to walk away from.  Good news they've been here selling epipens for about $90 USD/Unit for a long time.  Thats a long way from $700 USD/Unit, and more expensive by way of internarionally shipping.\n\nThe NZ Govt actually subsidizes the cost of the prescription to the manufacturer, essentially groupfunding prescriptions through all ta payers in NZ, and the power of collective bargaining allows them to get an excellent price that still remains profitable enough for foreign manufacturers to sell there, even though it is one of the most expensive countries to sell goods in",

I am insured. I have a $4000 deductible. So an epipen would cost me $700 even though I have insurance. Unless I first spend a total of roughly $5,300 in deductible and premiums. Then the insurance company would finally have to start paying for medicine. At a much lower price, of course.",

If you\u2019re a pauper in a palace, at the end of the day, you\u2019re still a pauper. \n\nI think I would rather live in Mexico like royalty with a beach house, a maid, and a  gardener. Hire a cook a few meals a week. You could have that for about $1500 a month total.\n\nSo really think about if you would be enjoying that life on a daily basis rather than as an abstract idea.",

Medications are highly subsidised.  However with a crisis on cost of living some have a harder time making ends meet. \n\nIt also means you don't have a choice in the type of medication you get. I don't mind this but I gather sometimes in US people state their preferred  brand etc. There's 1 agency called Pharmac that negotiates the price with pharmaceutical companies and what that's  is what is subsidised. \n\nThere's usually more than one type so people with reactions etc can try others. However there are those who are specific on what they want and end up having to pay more because they haven't tried the alternatives etc. \n\nBefore this it is $5 per item on the script unless you happen to live in an area near a Countdown supermarket or Chemist Warehouse (an Australian chemist/pharmacy chain). Those two chains have said it is free to get your prescriptions from there. The problem is there are areas (mostly rural) that are no where near. \n\nThere's a cap of 20 items for a family a year. item 21 onwards are free until the the year starts again.\n\nThere are also some stuff that is more than $5 which I am not sure if there'll be a fee for now or of that's waived too. Yes they were subsidised too but just not that low.",

Lots of really bad driving habits such as tailgating and speeding, running red lights, lack of indicator use, or worse incorrect indicator use (frequently see people indicate left and turn right at a roundabout) and so on.\n\nThere\u2019s a gulf between the contents of the road code and what people actually do, and yes, people get angry, or just drive angry all the time.\n\nPersonally, I think if you get caught driving badly, you should have to take a test before you\u2019re allowed back on the road. People treat driving like it is a right, not a privilege.\n\nLastly, there are all the stupid kids out there riding motorbikes in groups without helmets on and causing havoc, plus the tossers with the bucket exhausts on their Mazda 3\u2019s doing burnouts on the public roads. One idiot was going out every night for the last week around 1am screaming up and down the roads, revving the nuts of his car running it so rich it was constantly backfiring. Emissions testing isn\u2019t a thing here.",

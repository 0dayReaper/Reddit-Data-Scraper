Within a couple weeks I was up to 2 to 2 and a half packs a day.  It became habit based.  I'd light one every time I stepped on the floor.  Even if it was because I stepped in to the office to grab something off my desk.  Then, I'd subconsciously light one up when someone else did.  I had to talk to a lot of different people in different areas, so every one was on their own smoke schedule.  When I realized what was happening, I started leaving my pack on my desk, so I couldn't randomly light up, and cut back to half a pack again.",

The main health risks with vaping come from e-liquid flavored with known carcinogens, like the ones that make it taste like caramel or heavy cream (Yum ! Tastes like cancer, my favorite), or burnt resistors (shouldn't happen if properly used).\n\nThere's one major reason it's healthier, and it just comes from not burning stuff and inhaling smoke; anything burnt is carcinogenic. burning the resistor in your vaping stick is pretty bad for your health for the same reasons, so change it regularly and make sure you stop vaping before it runs out of fuel.\n\nAside from that, not all vaping juices are equal. There are some concerns that have been raised with flavoring agents like caramel because, well, it's burnt sugar. The main ingredients, namely, propylen glycol and glycerol, are perfectly safe when inhaled in moderate amounts. Nicotin is slightly neurotoxic, but so is caffeine, albeit not as much (and you'd need to take a lot of it).\n\nAbout propylen glycol, you'd need to *drink* it before it starts being toxic, at around 4g/L in your blood. It's also used as an additive in ice cream because it's slightly sweet and lowers the freezing point of it. That's also why we also douze airplanes with it to prevent frosting. Anyway, with the amounts you'd inhale, it's perfectly safe.\n\nGlycerol is a common non-toxic liquid that is slightly sweet and has anti-microbial and anti-viral properties; it's used to treat wounds and burns and as a sweetener in the food industry. It can also be found in lubricants for *the business*. Before we douzed airplanes with propylen, we used glycerol instead because it also had anti-freezing properties.\n\nWe mix both liquids (which have very similar properties as you might have noticed) because glycerol is very viscous, and propylen glycol is not; depending on your vape, you need different ratios so that it can diffuse properly in the resistor, but not too much as it would just drip everywhere and make a mess.\n\nFinally, studies that try to prove that vaping is bad for your health are either using e-liquid that contains carcinogens or intentionally misuse the e-cigarette to burn the resistor. It's like saying, \"Cancer-inducing chemical induces cancer. Also, smoke  gives cancer.\"\nSo make your own vaping mix if you don't want to leave your health in the hands of a vaping company marketing team or DYOR if you want to vape their tutti-fruity frosty bacon cheesecake.",

With a cigarette, it's a metered amount so once it's done it's done until you make the conscious decision to light another one. With vaping, I'd just be hitting it constantly cause it was convenient, I didn't have to go outside I could just stay on the couch, and it tasted wonderful. I could tell it was affecting my breathing at the gym just due to the sheer amount of vapor/residue coating my lungs. I felt like I couldn't intake enough oxygen in-between reps and that's when I realized it was a problem and I had to quit it for good. Been vape free for years and feel great.",

Granted he's 35 so he can do what he wants.  \n\nMyself, I'm just an old school cigarette smoker.  4 years ago I decided I would go outside anytime I wanted one and only smoke half the cig.  Doing that I've cut back to about 10 to 15 a day, and my dog gets to go out much more than she used to.  I have no plans to quit, mostly because I just don't want to.",

If it can cause even slight inflammation, that\u2019s a cancer risk, inflammation is a driver of cancer, doesn\u2019t matter if something is toxic at a certain dose. No one was overdosing on cigarettes, it\u2019s the long term effects on your health that are the threat as much as any toxicity in the ingredients. \n\nThat being said, it is certainly LESS LIKELY to cause a major health issue since like you said you are not burning 50+ additives or whatever the fuck is in a filter cigarette. It\u2019s also a lot less toxic for the environment. \n\nCigarette smoke ruins everything, stinks, and fucks up my breathing if I\u2019m near it, it pisses me the fuck off. I have felt headaches from when I used a work truck that had a heavy vaper use it regularly but it\u2019s not as bad as a cigarette smokers vehicle. \n\nThis news is overall a good thing, it will be even better when vaping has 10-20-30 year studies on even the \u201csafe\u201d versions and show that yes it can still cause cancer and XYZ and you shouldn\u2019t do it and even more people ditch vape.",

The big problem with this is the chemicals flavourings, addatives, and carrier fluids interact with each other and form new chemicals both when at room temperature and when vapourised, which we don't have safetly data for before vapes become widely used. \n\nWith the go to example being the popcorn lung conditions was caused by one of the flavourings being perfectly safe to eat but when vapourised become something else that wasn't safe. With was caused by a butter flavoring found in popcorn. But because it was actually safe to eat and had been proven to be vape companies added it to vapes and thought it would be safe to inhale because its safe to eat.",

The only somewhat precise mention I've seen on it is on page 301, supplemental figure 11 (the ncbi atudy), where they just said they bought their vape juice from the same shop at two different occasions.\n\nThat's a pretty big oversight if you ask me.\n\nThey also mention popcorn lungs as a general condition developed by vapers, which has been proved false since it comes from one of the flavoring agents that tastes like... popcorn.\n\nThey also conclude their paper by saying their research does not reflect the US Health department view on the matter; it's thus a private study. That we can be sure of.\n\nAnyways, to me it sure looks like a 300-page nothing burger.",

Chances are vapes are better but it is possible that some chemical in the juice is outright fatally toxic over a period of time (doesn't seem likely, but you never want to assume) but chances are vapes are healthier than cigarettes. Or perhaps it would be better to say vapea are probably less UNhealthy than cigarettes. I will say this though. My lungs feel a hell of a lot better since I switched from cigarettes to vaping.",

Because there is no way of knowing whether those people who start out with vapes, wouldn't have started out with tobacco if vapes hadn't been available. \n\nThis is also why those studies from the 80's/90's that characterised weed as a gateway drug to heavier things, have lost a lot a credibility.. A lot of people that smoke weed, are also more inclined to try other things. But, likely, not because they smoke weed. It's the other way around. They smoke weed, because they are more inclined to try different things.",

Especially when it's touted as being so \"healthy\". The nicotine companies have done a great job at getting a whole new generation of customers hooked who likely never would have been interested in cigarettes in the first place.

There is far less \"hit\" from vaping nicotine compared to tobacco and there are no additives which increase the strength of the hit (e.g. ammonia).  Nicotine salts are a different story and do give you a nicotine hit like cigarettes do (the ammonia added to tobacco turns the nicotine in tobacco into the salt for better absorption).",

Im asking for tangible data like medical studies not tales from some rando on the internet. Im not saying that there cant be an improvement when going from smoking to vaping but its hard to believe that breathing in chemicals regardless of style used is gonna be good for anyone. Like what is it about vaping that makes it \"healthier\" than smoking? To my knowledge the only real difference between vaping and smoking is moisture content when inhaled. It's still chemicals though. Lungs were designed for inhaling a mixture of mainly oxygen and nitrogen, and anything outside of that is bound to have adverse effects.",

The pistol with real ammunition is going do some serious damage to you while the pistol loaded with blanks may still hurt you but far less likely to compared to the real ammunition.",

This combustion process releases a lot of nasty chemicals. Carbon Monoxide as one of the easier to list one. But smoke also carries things like unreacted plant matter (carcinogenic) and other chemical byproducts of the combustion process. \n\nVape on the other hand does not cause a combustion. The fluid/oil is heated to the point where it vaporizes into a gas and you breathe that in. \n\nThe real risk from vaporizing is the natural risks of tobacco products and then the unknown effects of breathing a lot of vaporized oils. \n\nRight now we think it's likely safer since the gas temperature is already pretty low relative to combustion and you're also bringing in fresh air to cool it. Sort of like breathing over a pot of boiling water. \n\nSo the question is vaping safer than smoking is a resounding yes. The question if vaping is safe is out for more study.",

I always wanted to try drinking as a kid because of how it was glorified in the media I consumed.  But I agree vaping is still a lot more attractive to the kids compared to smoking. \n\nIn canada they are changing laws surrounding vaping. Theyre taxing significantly more than a few years back, banning and lowering the max % of nicotine, and even going as far as to ban flavours. In BC you cant even buy vape juice that has no nicotine in it, which is ass backwards for people who use it to quit (the goal is to work your way down to no nicotine ejuice).\n\nYes it probably helps keep the kids away but these laws honestly seem like big tobacco lobbying out of desperation. Theyre definetely aware of studies like this lol.",

Saw it happen to a group I manage on another platform - it started out friendly and supportive but once it passed 300 members or so, some of the new people joining started being snarky, bringing their default behavior from other parts of social media with them. Since I am a moderator, I asked a few of them privately why they defaulted to being negative or flippant in their comments, and all of them responded that they hadn't been aware until they read their comments again or were \"just having a bad day\" and regretted them later. I think people need to be deprogrammed from this mindset that social media has cultivated.\n\nI realise the irony in my post, so I will finish with this: Social media incentives need to be re-designed to promote honesty and balanced perspectives, while minimising emotional manipulation and echo chambers. If anyone knows of upcoming social media platforms which are attempting to address these issues, I'd be very curious to know about them.",

Nicotine, when removed from the plant and actual smoke, is not that addictive at all - its on par with caffeine at that point. Thats why products like Nicorette or the patch have no danger of strong addiction and the FDA has plenty of reports on that. The nicotine is vapes is quite literally they same nicotine in nicorette. The supply chain for free base nicotine is the same.",

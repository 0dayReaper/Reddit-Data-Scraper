Quick contact with local representatives medical specialists with Certified CDC with access to CDC LABS.\n\nIn my case in less than 36 hour turn around to recognize a new strain and develop a working complimentary vaccine. Anyone with chronic health challenges or rare dis-eases at any age.  I appreciated the quick development of the complimentary add-on vaccine for this \"new arriving\" bug.  \n\nPleased to provide the National needed data base on this new strain of viral or bacteria only 7 day in hospital.  Data information is always missing until a patient arrives. Amazing now fast critical event occurred after receiving my updated released vaccination in only 5 to 6 month. \n\nDon't know, if this is just my opinion; perhaps very helpful.  Thanks for reading my short story,  Brevity does provide clarity, without any apology.",

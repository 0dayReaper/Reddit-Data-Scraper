Well might as well get the air 64gb....BUT! for only 200 more than than that you can get the 256gb one, and 64gb is barely useable! But wait a moment the 128gb ipad pro is only 80 more than the 256 air, so you may as well get the better experience overall! Next thing you know you spent 60% more, oh and to top it off you're paranoid about breaking your fancy expensive device, that'll be 250 dollars for applecare, because you want peace of mind, and without it you could pay 900 for a screen!\n\nIt's actually sick how much effort we put into fucking over consumers.

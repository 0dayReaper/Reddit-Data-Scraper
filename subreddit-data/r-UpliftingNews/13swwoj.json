For this, you are sentenced to 11 years in county prison.\n\nWorst of all, you have been also found guilty of 11 counts of putting strawberry jam on a sandwich on a Sunday, a criminal offence in the State of Minnesota, for which you are sentenced to additional 87 years in county prison, plus 24 years for any living children of yours. May God have mercy on your soul. This court is adjourned.",

If it were more common to be retained one year that could alleviate that issue.",

We all came from poor families, and nobody pushed being smart as a big thing. It sucked getting held back. I hated everyone for a bit, but one day, it finally sunk in. I realize that I had to try or I would keep getting left behind. My two classmates and I became friends as the oldest kids in our new grades. We got our acts in line and have successful careers.\n\nMy two fellow grade repeating classmates also caught on to what needed to be done around the same time I did. We had each other to reach out to if a class was losing us. \n\nI didn't need anyone telling me to do better. I needed proof (tough love) and a few friends going through the same stuff to get my act together. I can\u2019t imagine how disastrous my life would be if folks lowered expectations or waved me on",

It seems like there should be an option to hold them back just on reading\u2026 so you advance to fourth grade, for example, but for some portion of the day they shuffle you over to a third grade classroom for reading.\n\nSo you stick with your peer group mostly but reinforce the parts that aren\u2019t doing so well.\n\nThis is how we handle education in high school and college\u2026 and I think middle schools do it to a lesser extent, too. I\u2019ve never understood why we don\u2019t apply the same solution in elementary school.",

When creating the standards for science, social studies, etc. they based it on what students should be learning in ELA as a way to reinforce the reading and writing standards because at that level reading is much more important. \n\nExcept math, it's kind of off doing its own thing. \n\nThat's why if most schools retain, they do it for reading, not math.  If you cannot read to grade level, you generally cannot do any of the other non-math things to grade level.",

Can we not define gender affirming healthcare in an article about children in such a broad and general way? It\u2019s just playing into these morons concept that the other side is pushing for surgeries on minors. Even though every respected standard of care recommends those surgeries be performed in adulthood, and only make an exception if the person\u2019s life is at risk, and even then only for 16-17 year olds.\n\nWhich is another thing, no one\u2019s giving puberty blockers to children, they\u2019re being given to *teenagers!* We need to stop playing into their narrative of \u201ctrans children\u201d being forced into medical procedures. These are trans adolescents and we have to start calling them as such, because the term children is being used to invoke the idea of people that aren\u2019t old enough to make decisions about their own life. Not that trans children don\u2019t exist, but standards of care don\u2019t* recommend anything more than social transition.",

Buckly as the guy that could *appear* to be an emotionally collected intellectual... until actual [push came to shove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho9M-q_kcn8).\n\nAnd that's the thing. I think you're being too caritative. Authoritarians (what the US insists on calling \"conservatives\") don't have, and have never had, an interest in finding the truth; not as a group, anyway. They have an interest in *winning*, and the *aesthetics* of logic are useful for that.\n\nThey love, appropriately enough, authority-based arguments. \"The Bible says...\", \"The dictionary definition is...\", \"the Dear Leader said...\" They are right not because they thought their opinions through, but because their accepted authority agrees with them (or have found a way to interpret it that way).\n\nThe thing with \"facts and logic\" is that they're the *ultimate* authority. You can't argue with math and reality themselves. If you have them on your side, you're right. Objectively, definitely, without doubt. Anyone that challenges you is wrong or delusional.  You've really, truly, *won*.\n\nThat's what they fetishize about intellectualism. You don't find Ben Shapiro montages with titles like \"Times Ben Shapiro Used SCIENCE and STATISTICS To Form An Opinion\" or \"Ben Shapiro CHANGES HIS MIND When Presented With Evidence\". He *destroys* his opponents. He uses the authority reason itself has granted him to school his inferiors.\n\n*That's* what they crave. They don't like the actual process of intellectuality. They like the authority and confidence that it's aesthetics give them.",

If they are, good. If they're not, they twist them, or ignore them.\n\nFor many people, facts are really just a tool to be used or discarded as convenient. The only goal is winning the current argument, consistency and consequences be damned. [\"The card says 'moops,'\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMabpBvtXr4) as it were.\n\nI find really important to reaffirm this, because the idea is inconceivable for many. They believe in truth, and in the meaning of words. But they have to wrap their heads around the fact that many others *really* don't, and that this mentality is, distressingly common. As [Sartre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semite_and_Jew) said:\n\n&gt;Never believe that anti\u2010Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti\u2010Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.",

That's the thing you aren't seeing. By refusing to give kids care there is still a choice being made. It's just being made by politicians instead of the kids and their doctors.

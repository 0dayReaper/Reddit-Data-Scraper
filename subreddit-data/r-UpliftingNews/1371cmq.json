At that point the material is 'full'. \n\nIts not a perfect solution but it will capture some CO2 which is good. If it becomes the main type of construction material then it becomes more significant. Add in other carbon capture and conversion technologies and you start having a real impact on CO2 levels. Capture tech includes large fan systems that pull in densely contaminated air that then passes through filters which pull/latch the CO2. Meanwhile conversion technologies include bacterial, fungal, and plant based farms that feed on CO2 and release oxygen and or other byproducts.\n\nMix those with technologies and techniques of reducing CO2 production and real change is made.",

So let\u2019s say one of these buildings has to be torn down, does the CO2 get captured and solidified, or does it like become a powder in the concrete? Only reason I ask is because when torn down would we end up with clouds of powdered CO2 or would it be stuck to the concrete?\n\nI almost feel like it would be a health risk if it powders.\n\nSorry if this is a stupid question, just curious!",

So rather than it being like there are concrete 'bubbles' of CO2 its more that the CO2 itself has reacted and been converted/absorbed into the material itself and thus doesnt break out from it. \n\n\nI dont see it being any more dangerous to breathe in than breathing in dirt/dust clouds. But again im not actually that knowledgeable on the subject, especially on the dismantling as there havent been many articles/papers on the dismantling results/tests of air quality/particulates.\n\n\nIf someone is more knowledgeable on the subject please correct any errors/misconceptions ive made.",

Yeah, I know breathing in dust particles is bad (look at the respiratory issues miners and wood workers have if they aren\u2019t good wearing masks and shit\u2026).

This isn't meant to be legally accurate. Stop trying to \" correct \" an obvious exaggeration. It doesn't matter what the law says, it matters what you can convince a judge. And that's the fucking problem. As another commentor said to me \" proving \\[the embezzlement isn't justified\\] is another matter \". We are all venting our frustration at a legal system that protects wealthy dudes, if you don't like it you're welcome to try to fix it. But until that time, let us vent in peace eh?",

She was [originally contracted for one year/100 shows at $310k per show - this was then renegotiated to 4 years at $475k show](https://www.thethings.com/how-much-was-britney-spears-paid-for-her-las-vegas-residency/). In total, she did 248 shows at Planet Hollywood Casino  - even at the lower rate of $310k per show, it would work out to her making **$76,880,000 for her tenure at Planet Hollywood**.\n\nOn top of Planet Hollywood, she\u2019s released 9 albums, done multiple world tours (which is where a lot of artists earn the majority of their money), been in multiple TV shows and movies (e.g. Austin Powers: Goldmember, How I Met Your Mother, and Will &amp; Grace), released multiple perfumes, and made multiple brand deals (e.g. with Pepsi and Sketchers).\n\nHer net worth [according to her father\u2019s lawyer (in December 2020)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54897918), [and court documents (from 2018)](https://www.etonline.com/britney-spears-finances-revealed-during-conservatorship-case-shows-she-went-to-target-80-times) is $60m - this is less than her estimated Planet Hollywood take home on its own - it doesn\u2019t even remotely account for the rest of the work that she\u2019s done.\n\n[This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2021/02/17/britney-spears-net-worth-revealed\u2014and-its-shockingly-low-compared-to-her-pop-peers/?sh=23a185b918ac) shows that Britney\u2019s lifetime touring gross is $450m - it also shows that her actual net worth is **significantly** lower than every other artist that she\u2019s compared to.\n\nHer net worth only makes sense if someone has been majorly fucking with her money, and given that she\u2019s been in this conservator arrangement since 2008 (and isn\u2019t allowed to manage her own money), she obviously isn\u2019t the one doing it.\n\n**EDIT:** As I\u2019ve repeatedly said in [replies](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/me2dde/_/gsduhoe/?context=1), I\u2019m well aware that she has to pay taxes. I also know that people have outgoing costs. My point (which becomes clear if you actually read [the link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2021/02/17/britney-spears-net-worth-revealed\u2014and-its-shockingly-low-compared-to-her-pop-peers/?sh=23a185b918ac) on the second-to-last paragraph) is that every other major artist that Britney gets compared to will have to pay taxes, and will have similar regular outgoings (hair, makeup, travel, security, etc) to her. The difference is that Britney\u2019s net worth is seemingly a fraction of everybody else\u2019s on that list - and that discrepancy (hundreds of millions of dollars) can\u2019t possibly be explained away by \u201ctaxes\u201d (when she\u2019s likely in the same tax bracket as everyone else on the list) and \u201cshe owns a house\u201d (which is an asset that is counted by your net worth).",

However i don't know how tour accounting works, so if it's anything like hollywood accounting, she may have not made a dime from the world tours.  \n\nBrand deals are worth more than film appearances, though ironically the appearances would probably help the brand deals. Jordan made more from Fruit of the Loom than he ever did the NBA. Heck he makes more per year from Nike than he made in his entire career in the NBA.",

It was really enlightening and  shined a light on how the whole system of conservatorships is incredibly problematic. \n\nA quick takeaway is that, her father argued that Britney needed a conservator because she was unable to take control of the most basic functions of life. Yet a few months into the conservatorship, she released a huge album and went on tour, and then started her Vegas show. Logistically, if one needed a conservatorship, they wouldn\u2019t be physically / mentally able to put in the work that is required to do all of that.",

Though the courts can issue conservatorship to a non family member, when at ever possible, they choose a family member instead. \n\nAs of right now her conservatorship is split between her father, and another source that she trusts. She wants her father taken out of the equation.",

I've been using Reddit for about 8 years now and I remember when \"OP is a fag\" was commonplace here. And if you criticized someone for using fag, you'd immediately get a reply with a clip from a Louis CK routine where he talks about how nobody uses fag to be homophobic or a clip from the South Park episode. If you don't know the episode I'm taking about, just Google \"south park fag\".\n\nAnyways, hatred for other minorities is still a thing here but this website has somehow become a lot less homophobic for some reason. Like, I honestly couldn't imagine someone sticking up for an effeminate gay man 8 years ago here. Seriously, even when people were supposedly \"ok\" with gays, they'd always have some caveat like \"except for the ones who make it their entire personalities\". That's just Reddit alone.\n\nAlso, people LOVED tearing Britney apart. She wasn't a human, she was a freakshow. The video of a Britney Spears fan in hysterics over her just checked all the right boxes for a culture that was so hellbent on tearing down a woman that was in the middle of a difficult stage in her life and had no privacy.\n\nIt was a different time.",

Whether you get to have any of your money.\n\nI'm not saying I have an easy fix for the problem it's ostensibly meant to solve, one could imagine a set of circumstances where a person has truly lost their grip and they're more or less just being incarcerated for their own safety. But it seems much harder to put complete faith in any third party. At the very least you'd need something like a jury or a fiduciary professional.\n\nPoor girl, I mean I never greatly admired her as an artist but if I heard correctly, she was economically the highest value performing artist at the time. Boom, gone, legally. All because she was freaked out she couldn't open her blinds without a dozen vultures capturing the moment on film? Then her piece of shit partner told her he was going to report her to the police for smoking weed and take the kids and there was no way out of it for her because THC stays in your hair so she shaved it off? I mean fuck.\n\nIt really seems just antithetical to ... To everything. Everything we're supposed to stand for.",

They decided they wanted to set them up, but before my friend \u201cS\u201d could meet up with her his dingo of a friend cheated on her best friend so they didn\u2019t get together, but she had seen his picture, thought he was cute, and was interested in going on a date before it all fell apart.\n\nThis led my friend on a series of completely ill conceived adventures.  He was convinced if he ran into her naturally, they\u2019d hit it off and he could totally hook up with a celebrity.  So he began trying to find ways to seemingly naturally have a chance encounter with her.  This was met with both much ridicule and encouragement from our friends group as he wiffed several meetings for various reasons.\n\nThen he got word there was a club she would frequent in downtown LA on the roof of some building.  He convinced one of our mutual friends to be his wingman and picked a Saturday night, booked a hotel room and tried (for the last time) to naturally run into Amanda.  He spent the better part of the night hanging out in the club seeing if she\u2019d show up, but got word around midnight that she\u2019d been thrown out of said club the night before and then proceeded to drive home drunk and if I remember correctly got in an accident and went to jail.\n\nSo of course S is pissed.  He proceeds to get wasted in short order and around 1 AM grabs his buddy and heads down in an elevator, unaware of the events about to unfold.\n\nIn this elevator S is in the back with our other friend D.  In front of them is an obnoxiously drunk man still holding his cocktail who they described as Andy Dick in appearance, several other club goers are in the elevator, and in the front by the doors is an enormous man in a suit, who hasn\u2019t said anything but looks like the character from the Hitman series.\n\nWell to Andy Dick guys chagrin someone had pressed the L button when what you\u2019re really supposed to press is the P for park level where the cabs and valet are.  And he\u2019s on a cell phone voicing his displeasure.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe someone would push the L button.  Who\u2019s the stupid asshole?\u201d\n\nNo one really replied, so he kept at it.  \u201cI\u2019m in an elevator full of assholes!  It\u2019s gonna take me longer to get there but it isn\u2019t my fault, just some stupid asshole!\u201d\ufffc.  At this point S has had enough, so he intentionally bumps D into him, causing him to spill his drink on himself.\n\n\u201cNow who\u2019s the asshole?\u201d  S quipped.\n\nBut before Andy guy could reply, chaos ensued.  Three things happened in rapid succession.\n\nThe first was the giant bald mafia guy in the suit had decided he was also tired of being called an asshole, and in a very sudden way grabbed Andy by his collar and began unceremoniously bashing his face in with his fist, which caused all the girls in the elevator to star screaming as the space between the knuckles of this behemoth were quickly becoming saturated with this dudes facial matter.\n\nAs the doors to the elevator opened everyone began to attempt to push their way out of the elevator only to be met with security.  That seemed like a reasonable expectation given the situation, however security was only interested in preventing anyone from getting off the elevator and otherwise seemed oblivious of the nature inside, so everyone was still pinned in.  Which gave rise to S seeing the situation right outside.\n\nAmanda Bynes was cursing at security demanding to be let back into the club.  She had attempted to hop on the elevator at this point instead of the traditional entry point to avoid her ban but they had caught on.  Cue S trying vainly to strike up a casual \u201cOh hey funny seeing you here...\u201d which was really just a frantic wave which she most likely never noticed.\n\nSecurity shoved everyone back inside, the doors closed along with S\u2019s final dream of meeting Amanda and the beating continued for another floor before everyone escaped the scene to their respective transportation home.\n\nSo that\u2019s the final chapter of how my friend almost got to met Amanda Bynes and instead had a shitty night to all our absolute pleasures.\n\nThank you for your time.",

But if she is mentally ill that never goes away and even on medication they can relapse. I do think someone else besides her dad should handle it though, cause he sounds like a jackass regardless.",

It seems that Britney has addressed her mental health issues, is stable, and likely has the capacity to make independent decisions regarding her health and finances. \n\nI understand the need to put her under a conservatorship immediately follow her mental break down back in 2008 when it was clear she had not been well for some time that eventually ended in her shaving her head and hitting the paparazzi SUV with an umbrella. I would assume that once the person is deemed medically and mentally stable and clearly demonstrates the ability to care for themselves, the conservatorship would end and regain all control over their finances and medical decisions. \n\nAlso, I assume that Britney is given an allowance from her earnings, but her dad is the one making high level financial decisions on her behalf such as if and when she can buy a house, purchase a car, and what projects she can take on and negotiate payment for record deals, performances, and royalties, as well as other decisions such as entering into a cell phone and/or home internet and TV plan, when she can upgrade, what utilities she will have, and any regular payments she must make each month, as well as taxes. \n\nAs for medical decisions, I also assume that he determines what care she will get, who her doctors will be, what medications she can and cannot take, and whether or not she must go to the hospital. \n\nNow that I think about it, it\u2019s like being an overgrown kid against her will in which everything is provided for her and she has to go along with the plan or be totally cut off. I cannot imagine what it must be like to be 39 years old, a pop superstar, and yet have zero independence or autonomy over your life. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Britney, but she should be able to get her independence back.",

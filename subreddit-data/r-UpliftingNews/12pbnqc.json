Similarly, socioeconomic status plays a role in health outcomes.",

                    "comment": "I agree. And I think mainstream perception needs a big shift when it comes to disabilities and neurodivergence and differences overall. The education system in most places doesn\u2019t help either. \n\nWe should be encouraging the pursuit of individual strengths and desires and abilities - currently we have a system where we have all these empty slots and people in charge of filling them. This would be fine if it weren\u2019t for financial gain and there wasn\u2019t pressure to survive and fight for unsuitable slots as a result. It would mean they could choose people who fit the slot best, and that the people can choose a slot that suits them.\n\nCurrently we have people living miserable lives in slots unsuitable to them just so they can earn money to try fulfil themselves and remove this misery. You\u2019re considered lucky if your job suits you and pays enough to live comfortably. That\u2019s for typical people. Then you look at neurodivergence and different disabilities and illness and all that, and it becomes even more complicated. Especially when undiagnosed into your adulthood. People can work and are capable of different things even with these differences to a degree (it\u2019s always on a spectrum), and they don\u2019t get the support to do so and/or don\u2019t earn enough doing what they\u2019re capable of. The supporting systems don\u2019t seem aware of this, or they are and it doesn\u2019t benefit them financially. \n\nMy apologies for this rant, I\u2019m neurodivergent and I\u2019m sick of being forced into doing things I\u2019m incapable of in my circumstance for financial gain of others. I have capabilities and skills that are ignored, and I\u2019m forced into painful situations trying to scramble and learn in typical ways unsuited to my brain. I see it happen to people I know too and these articles so don\u2019t help. And this whole topic ends up being \u2018see you\u2019re not useless, do something\u2019 when it\u2019s so goddamn nuanced and the systems are set up in bizarre ways.",

Half the article is about how she *doesn't* see herself as disabled, and never really has, because of the lack of agency and power it implies (despite obviously being so), meanwhile the title is the exact opposite based off a side remark. Incredibly low-stakes journalistic malpractice.\n\nAmazing person, though, and amazing role-model.",

The program they developed allowed for them to care for hatchlings without exposing them to humans (they used puppets!), so that they could safely be released into the wild.

One time a guest saw a native raccoon in a tree above a different enclosure and said not to point it out to us because we would catch it to put in the zoo. It was so disheartening to hear for so many reasons. \n\nWe had two raccoons under our care at the facility and it was only because they could not be released back into the wild. One had been kept illegally as a pet and the other imprinted on people while being cared for at a wildlife rehab center for an illness. Their hardships were human caused and so often we as a species are a threat to them. We always explained out animas backstories and it was never \u201cwe just wanted another animal for our collection\u201d.\n\nAnimal keepers are some of the most loving people I know because it is a super cool job, but also super thankless. Some people think you\u2019re evil for working with animals in captivity period, or want to try and challenge the ideas of evolution or climate change and you\u2019re the one put on the spot to defend it. People think you\u2019re playing with animals all day but it is mostly cleaning and food prep, throwing out trash and poop. We had no contact with most of our species and did training with the others to help with veterinary care. I no longer work there but some of the animals I did work with have since passed (from old age) and it leaves big wounds in your heart that feel like the loss of a pet or a friend. We genuinely love the animals we work with and want the best for them. We miss them and worry about them. My whole team was up at 2 am during a fire evacuation working our butts off to make sure our animals our safe. Not just because it\u2019s our jobs.\n\nAlmost all the animals in zoos or sanctuaries in the US are unable to be released into the wild. They may have injuries or illnesses that would be fatal without human aid, I\u2019ve seen multiple bald eagles with bullet wounds in zoos that can no longer fly. They may no longer have much habitat left because of humans, wether it be deforestation or climate change or any of the other many many ways humanity affects any number of species livable habitat range. They may be part of a group that if the last hope of their species, like a lot of cheetahs are throughout the world.\n\nYes, the concept of zoos started out super gross. A collection of animals just to view and enjoy the novelty of. Today they are the leading source of innovation and research when it comes to conservation. The species survival plan that most AZA zoos participate in literally tracts the DNA of endangered species to ensure there isn\u2019t inbreeding in small gene pools and to find best matches at other zoos. They trade species to help breeding efforts between zoos. Everything it centered on trying to keep those species genetically thriving, to educate the public, and to encourage environmental change so that ideally these animals can live in their natural habitat, and that the habitat it sustainable for them as well.\n\nJust thank you for defending zoos. \u2764\ufe0f",

If we compare it to the positive news from India's recovering tiger populations it's way better to support local efforts.\n\nThis does not even take into account that many species are hard or (almost) impossible to introduce back to the wild. For example, most captive-born predators die when released back to the wild:\n\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/predators-captivity-habitat-animals\n\nOh and it's estimated that 3000 to 5000 healthy zoo animals are killed anually because they are not profitable anymore:\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.idausa.org/campaign/elephants/latest-news/honoring-animals-purposely-killed-by-zoos-on-world-zoothanasia-day/\n\n&gt;And most zoo animals are either grossly endangered or animals that would die in the wild for one reason or another.\n\nOnly 23% of the animals in zoos are threatened, so no, zoos don't only exhibit endagered animals. They also lock away animals from perfectly healthy populations:\u00a0\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080311\n\nNot sure what you mean with the second part of your comment. Can you elaborate?\n\n&gt;even though animals only roam due to constant food scarcity and danger from predators.\n\nIt seems like you are implying that the life in zoos is inherently better for animals. While mammals tend to live longer in captivity, some of them (e.g. elephants) only reach a quarter of the age they reach in the wild. For most marine animals and birds it's pretty similarly low:\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/srep36361\n\nSome fish even have a mortality rate of 75% in their first year:\n\nhttps://reefs.com/magazine/aquarium-fish-mortality-rates-of-fishes-in-captivity/\n\nAnd 85% of carnivores, 80% of elephants and 60% of chimps show behavioural issues\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/opinion/zoos-animal-cruelty.html\n\nMany of the actually threatened species are also kept in zoos in entirely different climate zones, which does not help either. Zoos simply cannot match the natural habitate these animals live in.\n\nI get that many people think zoos are great and have awesome childhood memories connected to them. I also think that people working in zoos love the animals and do their very best to ensure their life is as good as possible, but we should be aware there are huge issues and not simply ignore them and that local wildlife protection efforts are way more efficient",

You lump accredited zoos in with non accredited zoos for the purpose of attacking their efforts and link to articles that themselves are filled with subjective opinions, unsubstantiated claims, and zero sources.\n\nFor example, your \"3000-5000 animals are killed annually because they're not profitable\" is an unsubstantiated claim you make while linking to an article from the \"In Defense of Animals\" \"organization\" that actually points to this statistic being from Europe, but without any source for that statistic, encased in rhetoric that shows clear bias and is obviously non-scholarly. It's not an article, it's an editorial.",

The comment I initially replied to said that zoos in developed countries are generally good, that's why I put there a statistic of how many are not even AZA accredited. And in every statistic that concerns AZA zoos I specifically state it's AZA zoos.\n\n&gt;and link to articles that themselves are filled with subjective opinions, unsubstantiated claims, and zero sources\n\nSome are from the AZA itself, others from nature or natgeo, but also other sources. I am fine with challenging those articles, but it seems you can't come with anything that proves them wrong.\n\n&gt;For example, your \"3000-5000 animals are killed annually because they're not profitable\" is an unsubstantiated claim you make while linking to an article from the \"In Defense of Animals\" \"organization\" that actually points to this statistic being from Europe, but without any source for that statistic, encased in rhetoric that shows clear bias and is obviously non-scholarly\n\nWhile this org might be more prone to biases on this subject I disagree with discrediting them, but fair enough. This number is a direct quote from the executive director of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA):\n\n&gt;EAZA does not publish these records or advertise the number of healthy animals that have been culled, but executive director Dr Lesley Dickie estimates that somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 animals are \"management-euthanised\" in European zoos in any given year.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356099",

Those have no significant negative impact on the water, as the rust may later settle down to become new sediment, while the rest of the metal structure provides plenty of living space too reef dwelling creatures. Most of them Filter the water, so if there actually are malign particles in the water, they\u2019ll get filtered out.\n\nAll in all the size of the new reef and the creatures living in the reef have such a positive impact on the maritime environment, that any negative impact the hulls have are basically canceled out.",

Other fish species may be tolerant (sturgeon, char) but I really don\u2019t know how many have been tested. \n\nI\u2019ve seen some areas where tires were buried into the sea bed. Hideous and nasty. Tires are horrible, extremely toxic if burned, and pretty much non-disposable due to the vulcanization process. We can try sticking them into playground/track rubber, but what do you know, they just leech carcinogens.",

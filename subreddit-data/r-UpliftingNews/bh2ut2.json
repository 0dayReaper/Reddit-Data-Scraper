About 20 people, I get to run the project my way and at the end of it we delivered a superior product only a week over schedule.\n\nAnyway, I walked in expecting to be not like a real boss but like a 'cool boss'. And it was cool. Everything was moving steady as we got set up and organized the first couple weeks. Identified a problem child right away but was able to mitigate her dead weight in productive ways. \n\nThen the honeymoon period ended abruptly, somewhere near returning from lunch on like a stupid day like a Friday, and my problem child went ballistic on a new hire on his first day.\n\nWhen we spoke about it her rebuttal devolved into a half-racist rant and why she shouldn't have to hold their hand on unfamiliar tasks. \n\nSo then I'm the bad guy because despite giving my new team the loosest possible amount of leash, one person created a situation that had to go on paper and as a result I immediately had to drop being cool and become the policy enforcer. \n\nThe point of the word vomit is my biggest lesson is I tried to be cool but habits of individuals and the pressure of the bureaucracy have this disgusting way of distorting even the most idealist minded manager.",

Many middle manager have a \"I get paid more, so I know better\" attitude even though they may have no idea what they are talking about. While there are things you know better in, there are things your underlings will know better simply from the fact they're the ones trudging through the minutiae every day. Take the time to not only listen to what they have to say, but seek out their input as well. This will improve moral, and lead to better solutions. \n1. Be as transparent as you can be. My manager is afraid of becoming irrelevant so he hides information from us, that is required to do our jobs, until the very last second. This leads to so many issues and so much wasted time it's unreal. Had we only known, we would have planned for those things weeks or months ahead of time so they weren't issues. Additionally, tying into point 1, if people feel strongly about something and you have to go a different direction, take the time to explain why you had to so that they understand. Failure to do so well breed resentment as it will feel like you're not valuing their input.\n1. Take the time to mentor your underlings and do your best to guide them and help them in their career. Praise them often, calmly and constructively criticize when needed, but help to offer solutions as well. Don't be afraid to suggest additional trainings, certifications, etc that you think the employee would be interested in and would help them long term. Know their goals and check in on their progress. This will boost moral as they know you care on a personal level.\n1. Actually recognize effort and it's resulting productivity and go to bat for your people if they deserve it. If someone should have a promotion, raise, or a bonus for any reason, fight for them. I've met so many managers who refuse to nominate someone for a bonus because \"you were just doing your job\" and not recognizing the extra effort that went in.\n1. Discuss before punishing. If you have an issue with something someone is doing in your department, calmly talk to them about it, explain why it's an issue, and what they need to do to correct it. Most managers skip this step and go directly to yelling or more formal punishments without ever giving the person a chance to address an issue they were unaware of.\n1. Lead by example. If you want something to happen a certain way, you better be doing it that way too. Like if your employees hours are extremely strict, and they don't have leniencies for things like running to a doctor's appointment. Or you want every operation in the department thoroughly documented. You need to keep that same strict schedule and everything you do better be documented to your standards for them as well.\n1. Be accountable. If you tell an employee you'll be doing something, make sure you are taking steps towards that thing, and communicating it with the employee you promised. And as /u/KillLock mentioned, this also means taking ownership of your mistakes. If you make a mistake, own it, explain why the choice was made and what went wrong, then work with the team to develop a solution to overcome it. Even if it's a situation where a mistake can't be fixed, your solution to overcome it should be putting some sort of strategy in place so that the mistake isn't repeated in the future. The worst thing you can do is take no responsibility, or blame it on your employees, and then just tell the team to 'deal with it' with no guidance from you.\n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit 2: added point 7",

They will never go to bat for you unless they are in a friend relationship with you. Although our company has had multiple mandatory trainings and lectures on equality, code of conduct etc. It still is a massive rat race and people go over dead bodies to get a pay raise because everyone in middle management is afraid of losing their momentum. I hate it. The people that work the hardest barely get any promotions and middle management only does what the upper management says. It sucks because it completely destroys the values the company is built on but no one cares because the kpis and targets have to be met. When I will be higher up I will definitely use your list of points. However I feel that I won't get to that point in my company because I will be seen as an outcast for actually be a people manager Instead of a numbers manager.",

The first offer he got only offered 10 days of PTO which went up to something like 14 days after 5 years. I would gladly take a pay cut to be able to have more free time with my family. Unfortunately not everyone is in a position to where that's an option and I agree that it makes since for the government to intervene.\n\nEDIT: Problem is that a lot of big companies would just offer less full time positions to get around it and then it would just end up being even worse for everyone.\n\nEDIT 2: My friend took a different job. I was not attempting to insinuate that this was his only option. I was just giving one example of a job that IMO doesnt value their employees as humans.",

The workers all knew their jobs and began self-managing and managing each other and because they felt their wage was more than fair they worked enthusiastically and were reliable. The odd one or two who would be lazy were quickly singled out by the two managers remaining because they stood out amongst their hard working peers.\n\nIn places where you have, say, 10 sales people and 4 managers, if you\u2019re short staffed by 2 employees you\u2019d expect two managers to step in and basically fill their roles for the day but often they have absolutely no interest in doing that, and instead crack the whip even harder over the remaining 8 staff.\n\nAny boss who rolls up his sleeves and works with his employees will have endless respect for it; it\u2019s the ones who hide in their office that piss everyone off!",

It's the #1 reason some supervisors go nuts over having to constantly be behind workers to micromanage them. Because people aren't going to give a fuck about their job if you pay them minimum or near minimum wage. Can't blame the workers here, you get what you pay for.\n\n**Edit:** I'd add that I live in China where I see this everyday, workers give absolutely zero fucks about their job because the minimum salary here is so low in comparison to how expensive stuff has become in the last few years, China isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be, it's probably even more pronounced here than back in the US\n\nI have a trade office here and I pay my staff way above what the local market says they deserve, I also pay excessively generous commissions for my sales team, the results are striking. I get motivated people who are really involved with the company, who will go far and beyond to meet their targets and generally optimistic mood and faces.\n\nOf course my company is small and even extremely small compared to Disney, but I don't see why it wouldn't bear the same results for large corporations.",

It's an unskilled but very physical job, and there are time targets, which I would always beat. I'd come home dog tired usually, but I wanted to work hard, hoping I'd keep getting good hours and be known as a good worker.\n\nFirst annoyance at the earnings was before I got my car. I'd often be late as my partner had to drop me off in the mornings. If he got up late, which he usually did, I was late. My shifts are too early for the buses, and a taxi would cost me \u00a316 a day. So, I was pretty powerless with this. I'd explained this before starting.\n\nOne day I told the boss I'd passed my driving test, and I didn't get 'congratulations' or anything, but \"Why are you late then?\" In her world obviously a car was just a little casual purchase you make on the weekend immediately after passing. To me it was months and months of saving up (not even a new one, a 1L 11 year old little petrol runaround). I'd always been on alright terms with her but I got pissed at this one and said \"I can't afford a car yet, can I??\" I got a little \"Oh...\" in response and my lateness wasn't brought up again. Fucking pisstake.\n\nTurning point was finally buying my car, and realizing it'd been 9 months since I passed my test and I could only just now afford one. Meanwhile our manager was on her third holiday this year, another 2 weeks off abroad. Now I just go to work, meet my targets, nothing more nothing less. I  don't earn less, I don't earn more, at the end of the day how hard I worked affected nothing. So fuck it. Pay me my peanuts, I'll clock in and clock out.\n\nI think your approach will keep getting you some damn good workers, ones that feel appreciated and will be glad to work hard for you.",

You get promised things will get better, but later you look back and it just feels like you've just been getting exploited and abused for caring. Taken advantage of for giving a shit by people who don't. It makes a person feel like a sucker and it just burns. We can feel strongly that the world really shouldn't work that way, but at some point it's like, yeah, but that's the way it is. \n\nNow pay me. 'Oh we appreciate your service.' Okay, appreciate my service by paying me, because that's the only thing that matters in this world. A pat on the back doesn't put food on the table or gas in my car. \n\nWhen I was young, my professional mindset was about honor and faith. Now I'm way more jaded and transactional with how I approach work. Ideally, I want to work with people who care that I'm there, who care about what we do, and we can all appreciate each other and work hard together. But if that's not the case, okay, fine: Punch in. Punch out. And then pay me. Because that's all this is then.\n\nSometimes a boss will try to make you feel bad about having that mentality. But if they don't actually care about you or what you're all doing, they're just trying to exploit you by playing on your feelings and guilt; the dream of how the world should work. They'll weaponize that guilt of treating it as 'just another job' simply to squeeze you for unpaid overtime just because you're a good person. And good people shouldn't have to put up with that. Prove to me we're all good people and we can all be good to each other. Prove you're purely transactional in how you deal with me, and I'm sorry, but that's how I will deal with you as well then.",

It's hard to relate to your staff when you have hundreds of them in your department alone.\n\nI always worked towards consolidating a small team of people I know and trust despite having the means to hire a lot more people for certain tasks. I rather hire the services of a third party for things that would require me to hire more people.\n\nIt's always great to be able to take your entire staff to dinner and to listen to what they have to say beyond just work related matters, to get to know them as more than staff, as friends.\n\nWhat I was saying is, mentalities can be changed, especially when someone highly influential within a corporation starts pushing for it. Management get stuck in their ways until they get told that they must adopt new mechanics by those above.",

My most efficient years were under him. Then he got a job on a military base and his position was consumed by the other engineering manager (I was in line for succession and would have had the job had the other manager not brought up absorbing the position). The other manager was a piece of shit, spent more time rubbing shoulders and getting on his knees for the executives, and barely did any work. Our department nearly came to a standstill under him and I left about a year later (half our engineering staff did, it was a huge blow and I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019re doing now, frankly I don\u2019t care). Your manager influences your efficiency, but most businesses don\u2019t understand *how* they do so they put the guy who\u2019s worked there the longest in it instead of the guy who is best for the position.",

Of course it should be higher near cities, but the basic rule is 'if you're working just one job, you probably don't have enough to make ends meet.'  I mean, I live in the middle of Bumfuck Nowhere, IL, I rent half a decent sublet, and I barely have any money left over after every check.  Its out of control, wages have finally grown so little that within a few years, there should be constant mass protests, every weekend in every major city to get wages raised.  \n\nIf a multibillion dollar enterprise like Facebook, Koch Energy or Amazon can turn out billions a year, then pay their CEO's hundreds of millions to tens of billions a year, they can afford to both pay tax, and pay their workers a living wage for the area.  If they try to shut down the factory, then the President or members of congress should then use the bully pulpit and say \"Oh, all those government contracts you get?  If you shut down that plant, we're going to give all of them to your competitor.\"  \n\nThat's how they should be using the bully pulpit.  Corporations never, ever play nice, so we should have a government that stands up for us.",

Yes, it sucks for the people who got fired, but limiting wasteful spending in order to dedicate as much money as you can on the product is the most sensible buisiness strategy you can have.\n\nUnfortunately it turns out those new development jobs are going towards live service content rather than new IPs, which sucks for consumers considering their track record when it comes to MTX.

The general narrative has been tax the rich higher, which would ultimately lead to higher public coffers, which IMO won't do much, but is that what would happen?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaking Disney for example, they make whatever per year.. if the people at the top are taxed so highly could it not be done to the point where it would stop making sense to take those gains? Or better yet taxing hoarded earnings at a rate so high it doesnt make sense to hoard. That money is still exists, the business earned it. It were not advantages to either take it for themselves or hoard it(ala Apple) the only place for it to blow is workers, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong the same vain I've been wondering what made the 50's and 60's in America so different from the businesses perspective? We are clearly living in a society now where money and power are largely concentrated at the top. What changed, and what about that era made it different than it is now? Can it be as simple as greed and a neutered and inaccurate view of labor unions?",

I\u2019m honestly not qualified to write this comment, but these are my observations/hypotheses\n\nProbably the one of the biggest reasons for the boom in the 50s and 60s is that the rest of the developed world has been decimated by World War II. The extent of US homeland damage was Pearl Harbor where as most of Europe went through 5-7 years of near constant bombardment. China, Japan, and the rest of SE Asia had also been heavily fighting during this time as well\n\nThe US, like the younger male host briefly mentioned, essentially ran a monopoly on practically all trade goods during this time.\n\nThe smaller wealth discrepancy during this time can also be contributed to this. After the war, there were manufacturing/raw material harvesting jobs galore because the world was in desperate need of materials to rebuild. As for why the wealth discrepancy grew post 50s and 60s to the point it is as today can likely be attributed to: \n\n- the rest of the world eventually rebuilt and were able to produce their own goods as well as trade with each other thus eliminating the US monopoly (granted, the Cold War was going on so that limited trade to a degree but US monopoly ceased regardless) \n\n- manufacturing jobs decreased in the US  overtime due to other countries being able to produce the same quality goods at lower costs\n\n- as these manufacturing/raw material jobs disappeared, there was not an adequate system in place to retrain the people who lost their well paying jobs with skills that would land them another job with a relatively equal wage\n\n- I would say the technological golden-era that began around the space age reduced domestic manufacturing jobs even more\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also important to remember that the economy has gone through ups and downs as well, that some industries\u2019 wages have not been adjusted adequately for inflation, that wealthy people are more likely to recover quicker (speaking relatively) from economic downturn and the quicker you recover the quicker you can begin to accrue wealth again\n\nEdit: I talk about manufacturing/raw material jobs so heavily because those are the jobs that built the middle class for decades",

What allows this kind of dynamic to thrive in the States?\n\nAnd every time I ask, I end up with: The individual\u2019s self-interest is so highly valued that both poor and rich buy into the idea that you CAN create your own fortune if you work hard enough. Which is nice as an idea on paper, but \u2013 it seems \u2013 not sustainable in reality.\nIf you think back to what America is built on it is these same values; anti-government control and power to the individual. It is so inherent in your culture and has survived through generations. The consequence is that there is NO collective support. You are alone to deal with whatever life throws at you. It is financially impossible if you are just simply unlucky.\n\nI am from Denmark. Higher taxes systematically work to create welfare for everyone here. Not just the people who can afford it. My country is NOT perfect, but it is mind boggling to me that the resistance to higher taxes is so strong in the US. I just couldn\u2019t live there and I love the country. It is beautiful! So much nature, so many great people whom I love, but everything is so polarised and divided. It is sad.\n\nSorry about my rant, internet stranger.",

It's also about a very strong anti-worker and pro-company attitude that's became prevalent in the sixties. The government doesn't just not tax the rich, they don't properly enforce monopoly laws, they basically let a ton of legal trouble and bad practice slip by with minor fees. There are laws now that allow companies to fire you if you join a union, and laws that allow companies to fire you without reason. \n\nSo taxes are one part of a systemic animosity towards worker's rights, and playing nice towards large companies.",

The income tax rate was high, but tax on investment wasn't much higher. \n\nPeople always forget this when talking about these so called much higher tax rates back then. If you are rich, most of your taxes are capital gains taxes and not income taxes. \n\nhttps://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/art/lfHendersonCEE2_figure_004.jpg\n\nI read somewhere that there were only a few handful of people in America who actually paid that 90% income tax rate.\n\nThat said, I think they could easily raise cap gains and dividend taxes 15-20%, and not hurt the economy while getting a lot more tax revenue. And taxes would still be at a reasonable level.",

I don\u2019t think most people truly understand how big of a number 1 billion is. A middle class lifestyle for everyone could be the norm if the super wealthy worked together and all pitched in a bit. This is why everyone\u2019s mad about billionaires donating to fix Notre Dame.

The people of France would be footing the bill for repairs to get it to any state of usability. \n\n(2) France spends just shy of $800 billion in \"social welfare\" programs every year. $1 billion is 10 ours 55 minutes of funding of social welfare. It would have maintained the status quo for 66 million people's lives for 10 hours 55 minutes. \n\nWhile a billion is a shit load of money to an individual, it is nothing to a country like France. That's $15 a person. On the other hand, rebuilding the Notre Dame to stand for another 500 years as a cultural icon and symbol may do something. A $5 donation from half of all the visitors to Notre Dame in 10 years will pay back the $1 billion, in 20 years double it, and in 500 years? That is the power of investment.",

Not to mention, it fuels jobs there; tourism can feed the surrounding shops, etc.\n\nDo people need better living conditions? Certainly.

            "comment": "Not many people know, but the explosion of CEO pay is due to a Clinton era law that forced much of executive pay to be tied to performance.\n\nWhile it makes sense in theory, it led to a lot of stock option grants that are \"free\" for the company.  Thus if the CEO hits targets, their pays are commensurate with that.  This leads to the quarter over quarter emphasis, since so much of their pay is tied to the market.  This in turn can lead to perverse incentives or misled incentives by unscrupulous CEOs.",

It\u2019s been proven the massive amounts these corporations move offshore to avoid getting taxed. If we simply focus on what is owed at the current tax levels + the massive amount of unaccounted for waste by the Pentagon each year then we can solve the vast majority of our problems. Rich individuals can keep their money that will no doubt lead to that sweet sweet trickle down we love so much and we make significant progress on our health/education needs.",

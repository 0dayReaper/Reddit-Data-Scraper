Things like cell phones, radios, and microwaves are like a camp fire. If it's stoked too hot and you stand too close it'll burn you, sure. But it won't blind you like a flashbang, and it won't pierce you like a grenade.\n\nTo actually harm you in the way you think of with radiation, photons have to be high enough in energy to actually knock electrons off of atoms which only starts happening at uv light (in this analogy like a flashbang or brighter) whereas any radio is actually at lower energy levels than visible light.\n\nRadioactive materials, on the other hand, are like big collections of grenades that are going off randomly. Keep them too close together or bounce their energy back at them and you can set off more in a chain reaction (nuclear reactors). If you have enough of the right kind you can get a runaway reaction doing that(a nuclear bomb). In this case the flashes are actually blinding(gama and xray photons), and they're flinging shrapnel all about as they explode (alpha and beta particles).",

It is so named because of its superficial similarity to the shape of the limpet, a type of sea snail that clings tightly to rocks or other hard surfaces. A swimmer or diver may attach the mine, which is usually designed with hollow compartments to give the mine slightly positive buoyancy, making it easier to handle underwater.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

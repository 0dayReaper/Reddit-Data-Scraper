I am my own repair tech now.  Washers, dryers, dish washers.  I can usually fix every one with parts for under $100 bucks.\n\nI've considered starting my own appliance company to manufacture high endurance appliances, with minimum of 10yr warranties.

Most manufacturers only offer 1 year full full warranty. Most that claim 10 are limited parts warranties on things that most likely won't break (stainless tubs and motors being Maytags extended limited coverage parts).",

I *want* to spend more money on a *higher quality* product, but in my personal experience even the \"built to last\" products barely outperform the cheaper options. My new criteria is looking at which products offer the longest warranties, and I've had luck going for mid range products that are more expensive than the cheap options but not anywhere near the \"best\" option. Even then I assume the product is only going to work *well* until around the end of the warranty, and I haven't been wrong too often.\n\nAlso every god damn product has to have an app now and I have absolutely no trust in that BS. I got a fitness/sleep tracker watch as a present only 6 months ago and it works amazing but the company is no longer continuing to support the app that it runs on. (And giving minimal refunds to boot.) So a perfectly good product is practically useless now. Unreal.",

It's easier to sell a fridge with a gimmick like large circular ice cubes because all they have to know is that it makes the perfect ice cube for a glass of whiskey. It's harder to sell a fridge with quality components because that requires the sales rep to understand the product at a deeper level and be able to translate that to someone with no knowledge. \n\nI used to sell women's shoes in college. All of the reps like to hover around the coach and Michael kors because their brand recognition required zero knowledge. I always took customers from there and to other brands easily because I could explain to them the difference between a full leather in sole vs. a foam one and glue vs. various stitching techniques. Shit was easy once I educated myself. But that required educating myself on the shoe cobbling process.\n\nSales reps rarely if ever do that. So when you say 99 out of 100 times what I hear 99 shitty sales reps and 1 good one. I never planned on making my money by selling volume over time to one person. I made money by selling 1 pair to many people. Those many people were being referred to me by someone whom I educated on shoes. I made no less money than the veterans. In fact, within the first 6 months, I went from being the new guy to consistently being the top rep simply by reading some books and watching videos on shoe cobbling. And I only worked it part time.\n\nIn the company I work at now (I'm an IT director now), we have 1 rep who knows everything about the products we sell. Every single month, he has more than double what the next closest rep sells. They ask him how he does it, he hands them the technical manual and they don't read it. Next month, the store can barely keep up with his orders while the other reps sweat bullets to get passable numbers.",

He started to bemoan how things weren't built to last anymore but I stopped him and explained that it actually extends the lifespan because it prevents the motor from burning out by snapping first. The motor is one of the most expensive components to replace so having the last gear in the gearbox that is most easily accessible be sacrificial makes them much more economical to repair",

He'd buy em junked from the US, fix and sell them (in addition to also doing a repair service). He told me it was easy money, but newer appliances were getting more electronic parts that were more expensive to fix. Usual points of failure on older models would be the sensors that detect if the door is closed or what have you that would be a dollar or two to replace. But the electronic boards might be $100 to replace. \n\nNow I live in the former USSR and everyone laments the durable goods that they used to have from the Soviet days. Clothes that lasted multiple years, frying pans that you can still buy because they are indestructible, etc. Now all that's available are ultra overpriced Chinese and Turkish goods that don't last long, the clothes are just crap quality with crooked seams and loose threads, and shoes that are just garbage. However, there's no other options. \n\nI think the market is ripe for disruption from companies like red wing that built stuff for life",

Interesting to see in the comments multiple women said they were made better than the super high end bags they resembled (thousands of $$ price tags), and some said they were going to return their \"branded\" one and keep this version instead.  It was new to see women willing to dump the luxury ones. \n\nI think \"luxury\" is just getting oversaturated and wearing people down.  And there are luxury stores popping up EVERYWHERE, not as exclusive as it used to be",

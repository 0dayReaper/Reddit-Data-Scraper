The means all we have to do is insert fuel and it just runs.  It's still 100 million degrees on the inside of course.\n\nAnd your statement that all we have is hot fusion is still true, there is no current fusion reactor that can generate any electricity (for self containment).",

For comparison solar and wind are the cheapest.  \n\n\nAnd before you trot out Norway as an exampple of a place that is unable to use that sort of power -over 99% of the electricity production in mainland Norway is from 31 GW or hydropower plants.  \n\n\nSolar also works really well in the artic.\n\n  \nhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200219-the-solar-farms-fighting-climate-change-in-alaska",

SA clearly doesn't need it, but SA is quite small by comparison to say, Delhi or Shanghai or even Brisbane.\n\nHigh concentrations of people and industry need condensed power solutions, like a nuclear power plant that might take up 1 hectare vs dozens/hundreds of hectares for a solar/wind farm that intermittently produces the same amount for a large scale city.\n\nAs a Kiwi I know a little about renewables too, New Zealand has generated about 80% of its electricity for the past 30+ years, and just like Norway, from hydro - I'm a massive massive supporter of well planned hydro.",

Green indeed, once you realize other green energies are too variable to ever give the needed energy throughout the day (and I have a hard time seeing energy storage become sustainable).\n\nSafety is much more questionable. It all hangs on \"if done properly\". Yeah well, surprise, a lot of human factors push for doing things improperly, and not just politicians/non-scientists. \n\nLet's not forget Fukushima. We're not talking about downhill Russia - it's frigging Japan! How can you still say that we as a species can guarantee the safety of nuclear power, when one of the richest countries in the world failed us? And it's not like such a failure only affects Japan. It's difficult to say precisely, but we know that nocive components can travel far through the air.\n\nAnother argument is that war jeopardizes the otherwise safe reactors. I have not heard of a nuclear plant so safe it is not endangered by war - and we're not even talking about a missile hitting it directly, but something as trivial as losing external power sources or even just too few people maintaining it.\nAnd no, not only countries that have nuclear weaponry have nuclear power. Of course Ukraine is one example. So war is very much relevant.\n\nAll that to say that the safety is not undeniable to me. Granted, I'm not against nuclear power myself, I'm mostly just not blindly embracing it.",

It's an obsolete  technology, and nobody was/is building them. The economics of them are self-defeating. \n\nIt's interesting that there seems to be a bit of a push on some subreddits to wave the nuclear energy flag recently...but it's all a farting in the wind, IMHO. I'm astonished at the gains made by renewables, and battery technology, in the past few years. I think we will eventually reach a point where there will be so much surplus renewable generation, it will be possible to harness some of the surplus to directly extract carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it as graphite or diamond.",

But having some nuclear to provide base load can greatly stabilize a grid. Right now coal and natural gas are used in that role and renewables cannot provide baseload without significant storage, which mostly does not exist and wont exist for decades with even the most optimistic projections. \n\nIn short nuclear and renewables are not in competition. They wont be in competition for some time. New nuclear plants replace coal or NG, existing plants displace coal or NG.\n\nAlso that is just for electricity, but fossil fuels are also used for industry (like chemical and fertilizer production) which makes up a significant amount of emissions and it\u2019s something renewables cant economically replace. But nuclear could be used for it\u2019s thermal energy (which is far less expensive than its electrical energy) to decarbonize those industries.",

One of the fixed costs of nuclear that you would hope to decrease overall costs as more plants are built is the physical design of a nuclear power plant. If we can design a plant, then build lots of that plant, we can decrease costs, right?\n\nTurns out, that's not what happens in practice:\n\n&gt;Many nuclear power plant cost projections and estimating guidelines assume that costs will decline as more plants are built. Such projections are frequently stated in terms of the costs of an nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) plant relative to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) plant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is possible that the rise in the average cost hides trends of decreasing costs in particular reactor designs. To see whether this is the case, we split out the cost trajectories of several reactor designs. We examine the cost trajectories of all four standard reactor designs that exceeded 8GWe of installed capacity in the US, corresponding to the conditions under which the EMWG guidelines project cost reductions. However, **even after disaggregating, construction costs rose across all four designs as more plants were built.** In fact, the FOAK plant was the least expensive in three of the four cases and was among the least expensive plants in the fourth.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n[https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(20)30458-X](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(20)30458-X)",

Building one or two SMRs will be expensive but building fleets of them would allow for economies of scale.\n\nI have significant doubts that SMRs will actually save money. They will be useful in specific applications, but not for large scale power generation. I say this as someone who has prepared models and analyzed economy of scale scenarios used in the decision making process of multi-million dollar projects.\n\nThe problem here is in how SMRs save money.\n\nSMRs save money by streamlining the physical construction of the reactor module. The construction of the reactor module - or any piece of equipment used to provide a good, like electricity - is a fixed capital cost. It costs you x dollars to build, that cost doesn't increase or decrease based on how much of the good you produce (it might have a physical limit on how much it is capable of producing, but if it produces less, the costs don't decrease).\n\nCosts that don't scale with the amount of goods made are known as fixed costs.\n\nCosts that do scale with the amount of goods are known as variable costs. The amount of fuel you need to power a reactor would be an example of a variable cost. The more power you want to produce, the more fuel you need. Less power, less fuel. The cost is proportional to the goods produced.\n\nTo make money, a business needs to sell each unit of good it produces at a higher rate than it costs to make. They have 2 ways to do this:\n\n1. Spread the fixed cost over as many goods as possible.\n2. Reduce your variable costs so that the cost of making each good goes down.\n\nSMRs don't do either of these things (you might think they do 1, but they don't). That's because SMRs are specifically designed to be *small* (it's literally in the name). What SMRs do is say \"I'm going to reduce 1 of your fixed costs, while also reducing your total output.\"\n\nSMRs will likely succeed in reducing the fixed cost associated with constructing the reactor faster than they decrease the power output, which will give a net benefit in the form of cost of the reactor per unit energy produced.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that *other* fixed (and semi-variable) costs are likely going to rise.\n\nImagine you're building a power plant. You need reactors, and each reactor needs a water pump, and regulations require that each reactor also have a backup water pump incase the first fails.\n\nI present you two options:\n\n1. Build a REALLY big reactor that can produce as much power as possible, then buy 2 water pumps large enough to supply it. The reactor is going to cost a lot to build, but you can spread that cost out over all the energy you produce over the next 30 years, and we only need to hire construction workers to build piping and power distribution for 2 pumps. And we only have to maintain 2 pumps.\n2. Build a bunch of SMRs, then buy 2 pumps for each SMR, then pay workers to build piping and power distribution for all these pumps. Hire workers that are going to have to maintain and monitor all these pumps.\n\nIn 1, your reactor has a higher cost, but you're saving money on the construction of some of the supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn 2, you're saving money on the build and design of the reactor itself, but you're going to have to pay to have a lot more infrastructure installed, and then you're going to have to keep paying to maintain all this extra infrastructure. Those costs never end, paying for extra maintenance technicians to maintain all these pumps is a operational cost you're going to be paying forever.",

You have to prove to regulators that the change will not impact operations or safety, which costs time and money.\n\nYou have your cart and horse mixed up.\n\nMost of the changes introduced are to meet new safety requirements and to accommodate differences in the construction site.\n\nIf you'd stop and read the report I linked to, you'd see that this is all already discussed by researchers.\n\n&gt;Most variable costs are from personnel and maintenance (both of which are theoretically lower in SMR designs).\n\nNo, both will be HIGHER under SMR's, not lower.\n\nIt is much MUCH cheaper to maintain 1 large piece of equipment than many smaller ones. Talk to *any* manufacturing plant in the world. All of them will tell you that economies of scale work by making 1 big thing, not by making lots of small things.\n\nThis is because lots of small things require more redundancy, have more parts that can fail, etc. etc.\n\n&gt;Since SMRs are modular and designed to be mass produced, the cost of any design changes would be spread across potentially hundreds or even thousands of units vs a few dozen (or less).\n\nBut *only* for the reactor itself - not the site where it is installed, not the supporting infrastructure.\n\nYou are taking a small portion of the capital costs and reducing it, but increasing other fixed and semi-fixed costs while reducing overall product output. This is the exact opposite of an economy of scale.\n\nThis *does* have uses, but those uses don't include large scale power generation.\n\n&gt;The problem of your large vs small reactor scenario is the large reactor will require materials engineering at the cutting edge.\n\nWe've been building reactors like this since the '60's and '70's. I think you don't appreciate how small SMRs are.\n\nSMRs generate up to 300MW(e):\n\n[https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs)\n\n[Vogtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant) has a power output of 2,430MW from 2 reactors, and those were designed in the '90s.\n\nTo get the same output from SMRs, they would need to install at least 8 reactors.\n\nThere is no world where operating 8 SMRs is cheaper than operating 2 of these reactors.\n\n&gt;A good comparison is bridges\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nAbsolutely not, and you're demonstrating your gross lack of knowledge on this subject.\n\nTell me, what are the operational and unit costs to operate a bridge? I'll give you an answer: 0.\n\nOperating a power plant is NOTHING like the costs associated with a bridge, and only someone without the faintest idea of how unit costs work would suggest such an asinine idea.",

A common assumption is that if you design a reactor, then build multiples of that reactor, you can save money by not having to design a reactor for each plant.\n\nBut the study I linked shows that, even when reusing a reactor design, the first plant tends to be the cheapest, with all subsequent plants tending to be more expensive to build. While safety requirements do play some role in the increase in cost, other cost over runs come from changes to the design that are required to fit the new reactor site.\n\nNuclear struggles to benefit from economy of scale, something that cost projections assume it will leverage.",

A degrading seal on a device controlling the atomic reaction led Entergy to close the plant nearly two weeks earlier than planned in May 2022.*\n\nNo worries though! All the smart people working on the plant will make sure nothing ever goes wrong (things only go wrong when you plan on it), so it's totally not a dangerous precedent",

New York's first offshore wind farm, South Fork, will be operational by year-end, connecting 12 turbines to 70,000 homes.\n\nIt is the first of five wind farms planned for the state, which aim to produce all electricity with zero emissions by 2040. The wind farm is being built by Orsted Americas and the utility Eversource. All five of the wind farms will power 2.5 million homes within five years, with offshore wind expected to provide 25% of the state's electricity within the next 10-15 years.",

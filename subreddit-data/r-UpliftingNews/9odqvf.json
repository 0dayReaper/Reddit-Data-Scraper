That being said, I just can't bring myself to abandon any of my OG party, so all the new companions kind of go to waste on me.\n\nThe important thing to note is that, to fully complete BG, you need about ~~60~~ 40-50 hours. BG2 with Throne of Bhaal is closer to 80.\n\nBut every hour is so worth it.\n\nEdit: overinflated the length of BG, was thinking of my \"hours played\" which included a few false starts.",

Combat in the BG series is real time turn-based with pausing rather than forced turn-based, so things are a bit more frantic as everyone is acting at once - rounds/turns go on behind the scenes. The 6 character party can also give you a lot to juggle. The BG series is based off of the old AD&amp;D rules, so certain types of enemies can be incredibly deadly, and combat in general can be very punishing as things can go wrong very fast. D:OS has advanced the genre in a lot of ways by adding all the cool environmental interactions in and out of combat, which aren't present in the older games like BG.\n\nAll that said, the story of the BG series is so well written that I have no doubt you would enjoy it. The Icewind Dale games are also very, very good, but don't quite capture the magic the Baldur's Gate had for me. ",

In their mind the fact that you have this knowledge and ability alone makes you a threat. \"Only criminals know how to break into houses.\" They do not consider motive or character. \n\n\nWe used to practice full disclosure. But then they started jailing security researchers. They declared it a crime because it was the same as giving terrorists weapons. That's the mindset of law enforcement now:\n\n\n    Knowledge is a dangerous weapon.\n    The mere possession of a weapon is sufficient proof of criminal intent. \n\n\nIt's the antithesis of the hacker creed that information wants to be free. That knowledge is power and power should be *shared*. It's inherently antiauthoritarian. Authority believes only it should have power because only it can use it responsibly. \n\n\nThis is the core of what it means to be a hacker. That's why we're hunted: Because we're okay with sharing. Everything. We may wear different hats, but to be a hacker means believing that sharing knowledge and information is power in and of itself. Whatever side you're on, whatever your motivation... Knowledge is power. And we want more. \n\n\nThey're terrified because we are getting it.\n\n",

If they succeeded in stealing, they would then contact the manager and let them know how they did it and what could be done to fix it. Then the manager would call a meeting to address it. They do it for theft, building security, or if you are tech savvy infrastructure ",

It's becoming a better area, but back then, it wasn't that great. There was a rule most of us who drove to work followed: leave your doors UNLOCKED. Now, I wasn't one of those people, thinking it was ridiculous. In reality, it's pretty smart. People who steal things from cars are looking for a quick grab. They aren't going to steal your radio, or even your car. They are looking for mobile devices and things they can sell easily without question. If they see it in your window, and the door is locked, they'll just break your window. If your windows are tinted and they can't see in, they'll just break your window. There's no way to handle a broken window other than you paying for it. So take out anything valuable and leave the doors unlocked.\n\nWell, after a crazy night, I was super tired. I made my way around the corner to my car to find the back passenger door wide open. Like a car parallel parked on the street with a door wide open. You can only imagine what was going through my head. I got to my car, noticed nothing was broken, but I still didn't feel relieved. Inside, there was the clear opposite of a mess. They had gone through the glove box, which was indicated by it's contents sitting on the front passenger seat. Now, the weird thing. Everything from the glove box was in a very neat, centered pile on the seat... Weird. I checked around the rest of the car, and couldn't think of anything that was missing. Actually, in the center console that now had some things moved out and put neatly on the seat, I found a pair of sunglasses I had been looking for. \n\nI called the police, because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.\n\n\"911, what's your emergency?\"\n\n\"Umm. Well, someone broke into my car, and I am not really sure what to do.\"\n\n\"Was anything stolen?\"\n\n\"well... no.\"\n\n\"Was anything broken?\"\n\n\"Uh... No... I called because I am confused on what to do...\"\n\n\"Go home?\"",

The downside to the above routers is that a non-insignificant amount of technical ability is required. It's not 100% plug-and-play.\n\nThe biggest issue isn't usually 'which' device someone uses. Vulnerabilities are largely dependent upon whether a router is configured properly and patched regularly.\n\nThe big ones:\n\n1. Change default passwords to something unique and complex (10+ characters using numbers, letters, special characters).\n\n2. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to access your router's Admin screen, which can help to keep your password safe.\n\n3. Do not allow external access to the Administrative log-in screen or other services (SSH, etc). This means you will only be able to access your Router's Admin screen from devices that are already \"Inside\" your network, not from \"outside\" or external - Internet-facing - devices.\n\n4. Check monthly for updates to your system (tip: set a repeating alarm on your phone or in your calendar). Usually these updates can be triggered under a menu similar to \"Administration &gt; System Settings &gt; Firmware &amp; System Updates\". These updates oftentimes will contain security patches that will eliminate vulnerabilities in the underlying system code.\n\n5. If you use WiFi, use WPA2-AES to protect it, and choose a fairly complex key. At the very least do not use WEP or an \"Open\" network.\n\n6. Choose your upstream DNS Servers wisely. A good option might be OpenDNS/Umbrella 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220. DNS is a very powerful component of most Internet-based traffic, so this can help to thwart several types of malicious attacks and vulnerabilities.\n\n7. Keep your computer/laptop up to date and use a reputable AntiVirus/Malware Scanner. Most routers assume that the traffic originating from inside your network is legitimate; so if you download some type of Command and Control software (think malicious TeamViewer or Remote Desktop) that is programmed to \"phone home\" after it's installed, then your router is just going to allow the traffic to go through and you'll be compromised.\n\nEdit: Added DNS &amp; CnC\n\n",

It was so ghetto too I mounted a Wi-Fi adapter in a metal vegatable can I cut and turned into a funnel shape, added a handle and mounted an led Dragon head to the top and used it like a radar gun (no idea how well it really worked) pointing at houses and checking networks as we drove around.",

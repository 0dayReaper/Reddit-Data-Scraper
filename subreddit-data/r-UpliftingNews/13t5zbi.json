The relationship between France and Rwanda is a bit strained, and as a Frenchman, I really cannot blame Kagame for being wary. France never had interested in helping Africa. Not now, not ever. Africa told France colonialism is over, France answered \"yeah, yeah sure *wink wink*\". Rwanda is one of the countries who gave clear conditions: \"we don't need charity. We don't need you to build our infrastructure so that we are chained to your companies for their maintenance. If you want to help, train our engineers.\" And of course, France never did.",

However, when his plane was shot down, France pointed their finger at Kagame, while Kagame accused France. This assassination is the spark that started the genocide and AFAIK there's no clear consensus on who shot down the plane. There's an amazing documentary called Inkotanyi by a French journalist who spent years in Rwanda to earn Kagame's trust. He doesn't bring a definite answer as to who shot down the plane, but leans toward the French government. \n\nSo it's not true that France directly backed the genocidal government, they openly backed the previous moderate government, but may have killed the president of that government and paved the way for more extremist Hutus to take power.",

We can already afford it. \n\nInsurance executes can\u2019t afford to lose their yachts.\n\nEvery time someone says \u201cwell xyz gubmint department is taking all of the money\u201d they\u2019re repeating the talking points of the industries that want the blame to be deflected away from them.\n\nWe could take any civilized nation\u2019s healthcare laws, change every instance of that country\u2019s name to \u201cthe US\u201d and implement that set of laws and people would pay less and there\u2019d be enough money left over to pay down the debt and/or buy more bombers for the air force.",

Your one statistic about \"coverage\" was deliberately crafted to obscure everything else that's awful, wasteful, and predatory about healthcare in this country.  It's incredibly obvious to people everywhere else on Earth how backwards our system is.  It's run totally for profit and we pay far more for worse health outcomes across the board.  It's a moral stain on this country and it doesn't need you to defend it, there's millions of dollars invested in keeping its indefensible practices obscured from the public.",

Armed Tutsi rebels and militias from across the border invaded and overthrew the Hutu-led government regime that was perpetrating the genocide. This was after the UN and the West completely abandoned the country to its fate. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know much about the Rwandan genocide there are some well made films that can give you a basic rundown. \n\n*Hotel Rwanda* is probably the most famous and it gives a good basic summary, but parts of it are fictionalized (Nick Nolte\u2019s character is a pastiche of UNAMIR commander Romeo Dallaire and a few other western military figures, for example) and oversimplified for the usual Hollywood reasons. I\u2019d also recommend *Sometimes in April* and the documentaries *When Good Men Do Nothing* and *Ghosts of Rwanda*",

If it\u2019s the metric used in the article, percent with some healthcare, this is false.

Rwanda is receiving a lot of outside assistance from charities and NGOs because of just how bad it is there. Rwandan healthcare is still lacking in access to many of the surgeries and procedures available in the west. Right now they are focusing on tackling preventable diseases like malaria. This has significantly raised their life expectancy, but it still isn\u2019t great, being over a decade less than the US still.\n\nYes, US healthcare is flawed, but no, Rwandan healthcare is not better.",

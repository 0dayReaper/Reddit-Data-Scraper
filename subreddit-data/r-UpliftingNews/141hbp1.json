Because it ensures each person has been informed and given proper consent.   But there is a maximum cognitive capacity for people sitting in a hospital bed about to go into a surgery.   \n\nI don't know what it is like I where you are in Europe, but in the US, there are 15-20 different important things you have to individually consent to now, and sometimes you have to do it separately for each doctor involved in your procedure.  All while you are already in a hospital gown and hooked up to monitors and IVs.    The intent is good,  but the cumulative affect is overwhelming for many people.   \n\nAnd the disclosures are often so complex that an admin worker just says as you sign it \"this lets you know the risks of your anesthesia.   This tells you how we may use your information.   This consents to the experimental drug used in your surgery.\"  And each one might be 5 pages of dense text.  \n\nPeople can't absorb it all effectively.   There has to be some consideration to the totality of the information and consent of a medical procedure and how to keep the process manageable for all patients.",

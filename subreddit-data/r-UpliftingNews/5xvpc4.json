I'm impressed he isn't just hiding those problems, or pretending that criticizing someone who is in a political office is \"too political\" but he's correctly making it clear that the guy is part of the problem, not the solution.\n\nNext election for the office is 2018 and there are a lot of people lining up to run against him, so we should have a strong candidate to pull Illinois back from going down the path of Wisconsin, Michigan or Kansas.",

A little over a year ago I made a sizable donation ($1,000---really sizable for me anyway) to an area of my cities underprivileged youth to assist funding their Model UN and other poly sci related after school activities. Really great kids who want to learn but are significantly underserved.  Because of Scott's Tots, I quadrupled checked to make sure it wasn't a recurring donation and to make sure I didn't throw an extra 0 in there or something since I wouldn't be able to afford it and I'd have no idea what to do. I can just feel his guilt so vividly that doesn't translate the same way other topics do. ",

But the system remained a disaster, with fewer than 40\u2009percent of third- through eighth-graders reading or doing math at grade level.\n\nRussakoff, a former Post reporter, devoted the next several years to real-time reporting about what happened to Zuckerberg\u2019s $100 million and another $100 million in matching funds. The effort she relates in her resulting book, \u201cThe Prize ,\u201d is a far more complex and humbling endeavor than anticipated, a case study in the difficulty of translating good intentions into concrete results.\n\nAs told by Russakoff, it is a story of well-meaning reformers so convinced of the correctness of their approach, and the urgency of their task, that they failed to do the hard work of winning the support of a wary community, while spending millions on $1,000-a-day consultants.\n\nIt is a story of politicians, especially then-Mayor Booker, with more ambition than attention span, leaving behind unfinished business \u2014 and students lagging years below grade level \u2014 as they climb the political ladder.\n\nIt is a story of the earnest young billionaire whose conviction that the key to fixing schools is paying the best teachers well collided with the reality of seniority protections not only written into teacher contracts but also embedded in state law.",

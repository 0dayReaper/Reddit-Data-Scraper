This is still good news. EVs are still decisively preferable over non EVs, and we should root for them over fossil fuel based cars. To the extent that we have a car centric culture, let the cars be EVs.",

If I'm driving across a state in a more remote part of the US, I need to know there's a charging station somewhere along the way. I also don't want to have to wait a long time for my vehicle to charge, when pumping gas is a fairly quick process. I know charge times are coming down which is great news, but the infrastructure is still lacking through flyover country.",

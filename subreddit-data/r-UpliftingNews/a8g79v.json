We visited the huge marketplace there which has literally 62,000 vendor booths. Sixty-two THOUSAND. Each of these is just a showroom for businesses (not end consumers) to buy goods in bulk. There are maybe five levels, and each level goes on for literally miles. It's absolutely insane.\n\nEverything you can possibly think of is there, for sale. Party goods, bicycles, clothing, ceramics, office supplies, paintings, hunting supplies, yoga stuff, inflatable rafts...EVERYTHING.\n\nThis place supplies the world with stuff. Alibaba was built around this place.\n\nAll this shit will end up in a landfill. And manufacturing this stuff causes so much pollution.\n\nThis trip really gave me some perspective. Mass consumerism is kind of disgusting. THIS is surely helping to fuck up our planet.\n\nEDIT: [Photos of this place](https://imgur.com/gallery/7MkQhoB)",

We keep buying things, most of which we don't need and certainly don't use more than once. \n\nWe can blame corporations for pumping out stuff and advertising it to us, but ultimately WE are the weakminded souls who get suckered into it. We falsely believe \"the more you have, the happier you'll feel\". But in actual fact, as soon as you buy one thing, you almost immediately form a new \"need\" to buy something else again.\n\nInevitably it's made in China. I'll bet anything that they see us as mindless \"stuff addicts\" and shake their heads at the ridiculous things we feel we need. They're just the suppliers for our horrible addiction.\n\nEDIT: typing/spelling errors - \"immediately\" \"They're\"",

But it was a key factor in developing our economy.\n\nSo China and India are currently in that stage, and we're asking them to affect their geowth. And they of course have to, no doubt. But what they're doing isn't particularly surprising. And when they move on from those tactics, first world investment from the U.S and from all those other countries is going to move somewhere else. Maybe Asia. Maybe Africa. Jt doesn't really matter. Those countries aren't going to sacrifice a chance to develop their economy, and U.S businesses aren't going to turn their backs on cheap labor.\n\nThe bottom line is, pepple in America don't really have a vested interest in seeing this through, besides the lip service of telling everyone we care.

And, crazily enough, find the small holes in your house and seal them. They could be at the bottom of your front door, the spot where the coax cable comes in the wall, etc. Any spot where air in the house can escape easily is a source of you using energy (almost certainly fossil fuel energy) that is unnecessary. That\u2019s usually the best a typical person can do. My house is 100+ years old. The plaster on the exterior walls is attached directly to the brick. I would KILL to be able to insulate those walls without building new walls 4\u201d into the room. ",

If you\u2019ve played a lot of footy, surf or had a lot of concussions you\u2019ll likely start answers to questions with \u2018yeah nah\u2019 or \u2018nah yeah\u2019 even though it makes zero sense. \n\nIn general we are pretty friendly people and don\u2019t mind taking the piss (laughing) at our selves. You\u2019ll generally be liked if you can laugh or take the piss out of yourself. I can\u2019t comment on all the cities but a lot of Sydney is definitely losing some of the authentic Aussie-ness about it partly due to a large amount of immigration (which is totally fine) so if you want a more Aussie feel I would suggest not spending all your time in Sydney but instead spending more time further up the East coast. Not a country without its problems (large amount of alcoholism) but I\u2019ve travelled to a fair few different countries and honestly there is no other place I\u2019d rather live. It\u2019s a relatively safe and relaxed vibe",

I am not sure about the laws regarding personal donations (donations to an individual politician) but I think they are actually illegal. \n(Edit: they are not, but they are highly regulated and usually politicians prefer party donations, because one of the regulations state that any donations have to be used for their work in politics, which is hard to provide evidence for in a system where campaigning is usually paid for by the political party. What exactly would you need those donations for? [here is the actual law, relevant section is 2.4.3 - German](https://www.bundestag.de/blob/294932/da77f9e63b7c3c6d4ae86a39be666c4d/geldwerte-zuwendungen-an-abgeordnete-data.pdf) )\n\nWhile there is no limit to donations to parties, everything over 50,000 euros has to be made public immediately and are [being published on the Bundestag homepage](https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/praesidium/parteienfinanzierung/fundstellen50000/2017). Donations over 10,000 have to be declared in a yearly report. Parties are also not allowed to receive donations that have an indication of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, come from a non-EU country, or anonymous donations of more than 500 Euros (there are more rules, but you get the gist of it).\n\nPolitical parties are partly financed through donations, but only about 15%. [According to this article](https://www.google.co.jp/amp/www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/parteispenden-2016-parteien-bekommen-60-millionen-euro-a-1199848-amp.html) the amount donated in 2016 to all parties combined was 60 million and only a quarter of those donations came from companies. [In 2016 Adelson alone donated 120 million to trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/02/midterm-spending-top-political-donors-sheldon-adelson) \n\nDonations have been, and still are, a very delicate topic in German politics, [for example the hidden donation that politically killed Hemut Kohl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU_donations_scandal)  or [the recent AFD scandal](https://www.google.co.jp/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/afd-co-leader-faces-calls-to-resign-over-campaign-donations) \n\nI don\u2019t think you are providing a good argument by pointing out that some other countries don\u2019t have upper limits to donations, when the systems are so vastly different.\n\nEdit: in 2016 Adelson donated 113million according to the linked article, not 120.\n\nEdit 2: The comparison between the 60 million and 113 million is incorrect, since one is euro and the other one usd. 113 million usd is roughly between 99 million and 100 million euros.",

For example, no personal limit on campaign donations I do not see as corrupt, as long as \"personal\" means a human being (not a 'legal person', which includes corporations), means the donations go to the 'person' running and not their charity (no tax benefits for donating to the Trump Foundation or the Clinton Foundation), and the donations are public.\n\nDifferent countries will have different definitions of what constitutes a person, what the line is between lobbying vs donations, if its public vs private, etc. Even the definition of a \"party\" is different (the idea of PAC's is weird to most of the world, and some countries don't even let parties be organizations. Being a \"conservative\" could mean you're under a Conservative organization with its own set of politics, a non-profit organization, or simply a defining characteristic of an individuals beliefs and nothing more).\n\nMost things definitely aren't an apples to apples comparison. Changing the definition of one thing (i.e. \"People\" vs \"Person\") can drastically change things, without it being obvious that the two arent comparable. ",

Banned.\nTV ads? Banned.\nDriving around in a van with a megaphone? Banned.\nBanners from buildings? Banned* (Unions are allowed to hang political banners from their buildings for some dumb reason*)\nBillboards? I've actually not seen billboards for anything, billboards in general are probably just regulated to the point they aren't around. \n\nStanding on street corners handing out flyers? Highly regulated. Putting up small posters? Highly regulated (These two basically only possible in the 14 day campaign periods of communal and national elections every 4 years, yes, you read that right- 14 days. Not a year, 14 days.)\n\n----\nWhat I am trying to say is that it is so regulated and basically everything you Americans would consider in campaign financing is banned, money therefore goes to quality of life improvements for activists and administrative costs- things rich people aren't actually that interested in bankrolling as the change in odds for their preffered party winning are rather miniscule. \n\nYou might say 'well a party depends on rich people paying them money to run administration' then but, not exactly... Once you reach a certain number of signatures and become an official party you actually get bankrolled by the government for administrative costs and campaign budgets for flyers and posters and you get to participate in the limited tv debates-\n\nTLDR:\nWhen the guy from Sweden said everything is different he meant it.

Public works on the level which would be decried as \"too socialist\" today.\n\nThis is true with most new paradigm shifts - it needs a good solid kick to achieve its potential.\n\nNow the old energy sources get to lean on the historical advantage of all that infrastructure.  However, the new tech is catching up (and beating) the old tech in certain areas - and yes, with help just as the oil economy did - and seems to be approaching tipping points in several areas.\n\nWe're in a transitionary time now, and the sunk-cost value of the old regime is competing with the potential future value of new regimes.  Changing things this deeply embedded in our societies isn't going to be easy, or quick.. but we can help it along (to our future benefit).",

Carbon tax is significantly the most effective way to reduce emissions while sustaining the economy if done right. \nHowever, the solution to Macron\u2019s - and many world leader\u2019s - problem is to have a revenue neutral carbon tax i.e. align an increase in carbon tax with a reduction in income (and/or) corporation taxes, which would make it much more politically palatable and welcomed by the general public.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m flattered by all your interest to read my thesis! However, I haven\u2019t put it online and I\u2019m not going to post it to this thread as I\u2019d prefer for my reddit account to remain anonymous, so I\u2019m sorry about that! \nThat being said I\u2019m happy to answer any further questions you may have.",

They produce the fuel, they don't burn it.\n\nNot only that, after reading the actual study I decided to write out some of the other major facts about those \"100 Companies\":\n\n\u2022 Only 1/5 (20%) of their fossil fuels are from investor owned companies (e.g Exxon Mobil, BP).\n\n\u2022 One of those \"Companies\" (by far the biggest producer) is China's entire coal market! It is just listed as a \"Company\" because it's all State-owned.(although in the actual study it\u2019s called a \u201cstate producer\u201d,not a company).\n\n\u2022 One the \"Companies\" is Russia's Entire Coal market.\n\n\u2022 Most of those fossil fuels produced (59%) are from state owned companies( e.g. Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, National Iranian Oil, China(Coal), Coal India, Russia(Coal), Etc.)\n\n\u2022 Every time you drive a car, use electricity, Etc. You are likely burning fuels (or using electricity that had to burn fuels to be produced) from one if those \"100 Companies\" therefore you are directly adding to the \"71% of Emissions\".\n\nThe whole point of that Study was to try and trace back to which companies Fossil Fuels come from, so more research could be conducted as to what these companies (and state producers) can do to move forward and eventually support/invest in renewable energy, and so more pressure could be put on the biggest Fossil fuel producers (China is biggest), not the smallest.\n\nAll this information is from the actual report (Carbon majors report: 2017)\n\nTL;DR: Those \"100 Companies\" are all fossil fuel producers (one of them is actually China's coal market) and they don't \"produce\" any of that 71%, they simply extract the Coal, Oil and Gas; Which is then burned in your car, in Power Stations to produce Electricity for you, in planes Etc. So the 71% emissions are actually produced downstream by us\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: thanks for the silver.",

Mind you, these are scientists who study evolution and extinctions. With extinctions in mind many happened due to climate change.\n\nWhich is what he is trying to raise money to stop. It seems rather contradictory to encourage fixing a problem, while also stopping people from studying that problem. \n\nI appreciate what his foundation has done, but climate change isn't some problem that's going to fix itself with just money, we need accurate studies of the past to actually make progress.",

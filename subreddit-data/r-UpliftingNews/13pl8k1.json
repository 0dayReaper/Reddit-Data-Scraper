Interestingly, we don't feel the need to interfere and generally let nature take its course. Otters rape baby seals and noone feels the need to 'protect the seals' or 'punish / educate the otters'.\n\nSimilarly, how animals treat others within their species is different from how they treat other species. When wolves fight each other for dominance, they typically don't go for the kill. One will yield, and the other stops. But when wolves encounter a flock of sheep, they will simply kill them 'just because'. In Belgium, wild wolves are on the rise and regularly leave dead sheep or other animals in their wake. And our response: you are not allowed to do anything because wolves are protected. And it's not like the wolves kill only that which they eat. they regularly kill a flock of sheep by ripping out their throats and then just eating a little bit from 1 of them.\n\nIn general, any species has 'rules' for their own species that are different from how they treat other species. As a species we have decided that rape is bad, and have invented the concept of 'age of consent'. These concepts are based solely on what we decide as a species. Morality is a self defined concept. For example, age of consent is different in different countries. There is no universal standard to define what is moral or amoral.\n\nBut to turn back to the discussion at hand: it is perfectly natural that we have different standards for how we treat animals vs how we treat each other. And that includes whether we eat animals or not.",

So high that despite the dangers, people will still kill the animals. Because harvesting ivory is typically by far the most profitable venture for local people living near the elephants.\n\nYou typically need behavioral change campaigns in the societies that demand the ivory products to reduce demand. That's what WWF did a few years ago after China banned the ivory trade within the country and it was pretty successful too. So there's hope!",

However, as a metric, 'animals killed' is related to demand which is partially driven by both legal and illegal supply.\n\nDespite the 1989 CITES ban on the international trade of ivory many elephants are still hunted due to the price of illegal ivory (which has increased since the ban) as well as people purchasing legal ivory and illegally hunted ivory that has been laundered.\n\nOne such instance is China. As their population's general wealth has increased, many individuals are now able to travel abroad for vacations. During which they purchase ivory in legal markets since domestically, new sales of ivory are illegal, even if possession isn't. However, through a focused campaign of behavioral modification incentivized through social media campaigns, WWF was able to significantly reduce demand in this sector.\n\nI'm not arguing that allowing legal hunting would decrease hunting. However, I am arguing that making it illegal increases illegal hunting and thus increases animals killed due to increased economic incentives for local hunters to kill more elephants in countries with access to legal and illegal markets, domestic government corruption, civil war, and poor domestic human development.\n\nIn many of the areas elephants roam, they terrorize villages, eating crops and tearing down houses to drink water. So it's only natural that many subsistence farmers (who may hold intrinsic or relational values towards elephants) would be okay with increasing the number of elephants killed when they receive no instrumental value from the elephants being alive. Thus we need to incentivize change in the local hunters to see the elephants as more valuable either instrumentally or intrinsically/relationally while also fixing the issues of poor human development and government corruption to see lasting improvements in elephant populations across species and populations.\n\nTLDR: Help people not be poor, and they won't choose to kill elephants to make ends meet. And use social media campaigns to convince people not to buy ivory.\n\nSources:\n\n[IPBES Report on Valuation of Nature](https://www.ipbes.net/the-values-assessment)\n\n[WWF Elephant Ivory Initiative 2018 -2022](https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/45k0oawb9c_elephant_ivory_initiative_report_2018_2022.pdf?_ga=2.44455328.545870146.1672589800-1291765854.1670880768)\n\n[Legal ivory trade in a corrupt world and its impact on African elephant populations](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12377)\n\n[CITES and the African Elephant](https://brill.com/view/journals/cjel/4/1/article-p44_3.xml)\n\n[Global ivory market prices since the 1989 CITES ban](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.07.020)\n\n[The International Ban on Ivory Sales and its Effects on Elephant Poaching in Africa](https://doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azp030)\n\n[Impact of the ivory trade ban on poaching incentives: a numerical example](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00234-2) &lt;- This one provides actions for governments to take in relation to bans that can reduce demand and illegal hunting.\n\n[The neoliberal elephant: Exploring the impacts of the trade ban in ivory on the commodification and neoliberalisation of elephants](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.09.002)",

I think a niche industry will always exist (both for assholes who need exclusive things and for legitimate uses), but we're seeing development of alternatives with materials like mushrooms which covers casual use.\n\nLeather itself is an ethical can of worms. It requires dead animals, but its durability and longevity mean it's arguably better for the climate than current alternatives, especially since it's basically using waste materials. .\n\nI personally buy leather for specific long-term purchases, but where I can I try to buy stuff like kangaroo leather which can be sourced from roadkill or pest control. Ironically the USA has banned kangaroo leather because of a PETA campaign, despite it being probably the most ethical and climate-friendly source of leather there is.\n\nRe your overall comments: I get the vibe that you're vegan. To use an old adage, I think you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. \n\nI do think everyone should think more about where their food comes from, but humans need to go through a process to change deep, core opinions and beliefs. For me, this came from a choice to go travel with nomads in Mongolia. This involved a lot of livestock work, including slaughter, which made me very directly face where my food came from and at what cost. \n\nI still eat meat, but far less of it than before that experience. 1/3 max of my meals have meat and the meat we use is as an accent instead of the main - eg one chicken thigh makes at least 4 meals. I think about food waste in terms of animals which died. At the same time, I've been around sheep for long enough to learn they experience the world in a very different way from humans. \n\nI do think, if one is to eat meat, one should watch and learn what the process really entails.",

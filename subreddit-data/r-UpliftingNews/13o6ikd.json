The Forest Service is under the Dept. of Agriculture.\n\nThe National Park Service's mission is conservation, historic preservation and recreation, and is under the Dept. of the Interior.  It includes National Monuments, National Recreation Areas, National Historic Sites, and National Seashores, etc., but not National Forests.  In general, hunting is only allowed in the latter, though there are exceptions for culling populations.\n\nThe Dept. of the Interior also has National Wildlife Refuges under the Fish and Wildlife Service, focused on conservation and sometimes limiting recreational uses, and land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, focused primarily on economic uses , like mining and grazing.\n\nEdit - I had monuments twice. added note about hunting",

I\u2019ve only been to the coasts (Baja and Riviera Maya) where it definitely can get hot, but I\u2019ve never been to the highlands where it can be lovely year round. \n\nI didn\u2019t personally experience much humidity or 30C+ temperatures in Central America. Temperatures were usually around 22-25C during the day iirc (cold at night though). And you\u2019ll get way more mosquitoes in the lowlands of Canada than above the mosquito line (any country). \n\nI grew up in snowy New England, for the record. However if your research into Central America consists of videos of Texas that you assume are like Mexico, you probably will be most comfortable in the UK.",

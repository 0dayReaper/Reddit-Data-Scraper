                            "comment": "It was a warm summer evening when Mary returned home from work to find a small box sitting on her front porch. Curious, she opened the box to find five dolls nestled inside. They were all different sizes and shapes, but what caught her attention was the note scratched on the side of the mailbox next to them. \"We have decided to live here,\" it read.\n\nMary found the note unsettling but shrugged it off, assuming it was some sort of prank. She placed the dolls on a shelf in her living room and went about her evening.\n\nThat night, Mary woke up to strange noises coming from her mailbox outside. She got up to investigate and found that the dolls had somehow made their way into her mailbox. She didn't know how they had managed to do that, but she decided to leave them there since they seemed happy.\n\nOver the next few days, Mary noticed that the dolls seemed to move around on their own. She would place them on the shelf in the morning and find them in different positions when she returned home from work. She started to feel uneasy, wondering if she was going crazy.\n\nOne night, Mary woke up to find the dolls standing at the foot of her bed, staring at her with their unblinking eyes. She tried to scream, but no sound came out. The dolls started to move closer, and Mary felt a coldness in the air that chilled her to the bone.\n\nShe tried to run, but her body wouldn't respond. The dolls closed in, and Mary felt their cold hands on her skin. She couldn't move or scream as they dragged her towards the mailbox.\n\nWhen Mary woke up the next morning, she was back in her bed, and the dolls were back on the shelf in the living room. She assumed it had all been a nightmare until she saw the scratches on her arms where the dolls had touched her.\n\nTerrified, Mary tried to get rid of the dolls, but they always seemed to find their way back into her home. She felt trapped and helpless, and the dolls seemed to enjoy tormenting her.\n\nEventually, Mary was found dead in her home, surrounded by the dolls. The police could never explain what had happened to her, but the dolls remained in her home, waiting for their next victim.",

                            "comment": "Here's my story and my story account. Currently I have no ways set up for you to give me money, but I definitely would like some. The one thing I want to point out is that I wrote this within the last eight hours, and for the last four I have become progressively more drunk. Anyway, what I most hope is that you like this cheesy horror story. Cheers, JTHM\n\nMrs Morecombe always checked the mail in the morning, though she knew it didn't arrive until the afternoon. Closing the door carefully behind her and picking up the daily newspaper, she would waddle her way down the garden path, tip back the top of the letterbox and gaze into its slightly dirty emptiness for a moment. Then she would look around the street, perhaps to see if the mailman was in sight, or perhaps to see if anyone had noticed her being disappointed.\n\nClosing the box, she would turn and waddle her way back up the garden path, struck by a feeling of some malaise. Disappointment in the lack of mail, disappointment in herself for performing such pointless tasks... She didn't know and no longer thought about it. Like the act of checking for nevermail itself, her feelings had become habit and she waddled her way through her daily rituals and their associated emotions laid out as clearly as her garden path.\n\nOn Tuesday however, Mrs Morecombe found something altogether unexpected. Tipping back the lid she gazed, her disappointment waiting in the wings for its cue, but now the emptiness was not. A strangely familiar smell distracted Mrs Morecombe, and she took a moment to process that not only was the letterbox *not* empty, neither did it contain mail. Several seconds passed then, as the workings of her mind ground through mental gears long gone to rust. There was no mail in the letterbox. In the letterbox were two small dolls, as if from a dollhouse. They lay flat on a folded piece of paper. Mrs Morecombe reached in, pulled the paper from beneath the dolls and unfolded it.\n\nWE'VE DECIDED TO LIVE HERE\n\nThe words were stabbed into the paper with a red felt pen leaving angry indents and near-tears. The handwriting was aggressive, its letters slashed to points. It was messy handwriting and if Mrs Morecombe had had any inclination towards analytic thought she might have considered it to be the product of an unhinged mind. Her only consideration was that the note was not addressed to her and therefore did not constitute mail. She blinked stupidly at the note for a time before connecting it to the dolls. Looking now at the dolls her memory twitched, something from long ago rolled in its sleep. *They used to bring me dolls.* \n\nThe dolls were simple, carved wooden figurines of a man and a woman. Their faces were painted with the same hand as the note and were somehow vicious. Did the mouths leer or smile? Were the eyes closed, or narrowed in predatory focus? Nasty little things. Their clothes were torn from hessian sacking and kept in place with bobby pins at the back. Mrs Morecombe examined the dolls for a few minutes, turning them over in her hands. Then something amazing happened. Mrs Morecombe smiled. *They are bringing me dolls.* In the murky underdark of her mind the question of her daily morning quest to the letterbox found its resolution. *I was hoping they would bring me dolls*.\n\nMrs Morecombe replaced the dolls carefully in the letterbox and looked triumphantly around the street. Perhaps to see if anyone was approaching with more dolls, or perhaps to see if anyone else had noticed her vindication. Sun shone on an empty street, and somehow this was further vindication. *What is mine is mine.*\n\nMrs Morecombe then turned and waddled her way back up the garden path, a new energy seeming to radiate from the core deep within her bulk. Long quiescent parts of her mind and body were stirring. The note, forgotten, fluttered to the ground as she entered her house, the vague thought of a nice hot cup of tea in her mind meant she didn't notice that the door was already open.\n\nClosing the door behind her, Mrs Morecombe went to the kitchen and turned the kettle on. Nothing happened. She flipped the switch a few times, then sighed. *Fusebox.* She turned to find in the doorway a man in a devil's mask holding a large blade. Mrs Morecombe regarded the intruder blankly for a moment, then the man punched her in the face and everything went red.",

                                    "comment": "Thirteen. A good number. A powerful number. But there were more powerful numbers to come. They hadn't stopped at three. They hadn't stopped at seven. They hadn't stopped at nine, or eleven. All powerful numbers in their own right (rite, right?) but what really mattered was the mayhem. \"It's all about hearts and minds,\" that's what Elijah used to say. \"Killing for the Lord is its own virtue and its own reward, but what He really wants is fear.\"\n\nElijah was gone now, but the years that Elizabeth and Stuart had spent in his unholy church had rendered them perfect soldiers for Satan. Betty and Stu, Stu and Betty. Just a couple of nice folks in town for the week. Do a bit of shopping, see the sights, a spot of ritual murder and then off across the country to another town. All in the service of the dark Lord. Stu and Betty felt blessed by Satan and righteous in their murders. They had pride in their work and in their selves.\n\nAs Elijah had said, fear was the point. The killing was the reward for the fear that came later. And to increase that fear, the killing should be as gruesome and spectacular as possible. Stu was a dab hand at dismembering bodies and Betty had lots of fun painting symbols of power on the walls in the victim's blood. \"You know what we are? We're a power couple,\" Betty said one day. \"We're killing it.\" They had a good laugh over that one. Betty and Stu were smug and certain when alone together. Knowing smiles and glib, sardonic pronouncements of dogma were their love language. They held so many pleasurable fantasies about themselves. They were assured of their importance not only as individuals but in a global sense, a spiritual sense. After all, being instrumental in the birth of the Antichrist and the beginning of a new eternal Hell on Earth was super important. These were the thoughts they recognised and allowed themselves to have. At no time did they consciously think \"I AM NOT NOTHING, I AM SOMETHING, I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU SOMEHOW.\" That thought dwelt in depths and screamed into abyss.\n\nStu and Betty had a simple method. Find a person or people who make easy targets, and live in a reasonably private location. A farmhouse, or even just a freestanding suburban with good tree cover. Better if the people are pitiable somehow, or pillars of the community. Get into the house while no-one was home, hide and wait for the residents to arrive and get comfortable. Then maybe some foreplay - creaking floorboards upstairs *is there someone up there?* - knock on the door but nobody is there - cut the power and the phone line and wait for the realisation - whatever seemed appropriate and entertaining at the time. After all, this was Betty and Stu's reward. This sublime ritual of death and mutilation, this animalistic tearing of flesh, this artistry of murder. In rewarding themselves they exalted their Lord.\n\nStu and Betty had left the previous town in tatters. A pastor, known locally for his fair-mindedness and for his open heart, known locally as an excellent mediator and moral steward, and known locally for having a son who got into trouble in the city and then got into trouble in town and dresses like one of those rock stars who bite the heads off bats. A pastor and his wife, known locally. Betty and Stu easily let themselves in to the parsonage on Sunday morning and spent the day desecrating the house. Stu smeared dog shit over the walls, bare hands dipping into the bucket of shit collected for purpose. Betty took the cats they had captured and killed the day before and hacked bits off them while walking around the house, leaving smears and paws and fur on mantelpiece and dining table. She pulled out their spines and replaced the fresh daffodils in the vase on the kitchen lintel with a bouquet of gory vertebrae. Then they put on their devil masks - which Betty had made herself - and waited. \n\nThe sound of the pastor's car in the driveway was Stu's cue to leave via the back door. Betty stood out of sight of the front door, within reach of the telephone, gripping her long blade with a sensual anticipation. The car pulled up in front of the house. Betty couldn't hear what they were saying but could hear the happiness and security in the tone of their voices, and rejoiced that soon they would soon be shown emptiness and soon after become emptiness. The car doors closed. The front door opened. \"...and Michael Cavendish seems to be doing much better, I sp-\" Betty heard the pastor's intake of breath as he saw, or smelled, the state of his home. \"What!\" \"Oh no!\" Betty could hear their oncoming realisation. \"Jude... I'll call the police.\" Betty heard determined footsteps coming her way and stepped out, weaving the long blade in front of her. \"Wha?\" The pastor was quick to overcome his shock and turned to run to the door. It was then that Stu pushed the pastor's wife further into the room from outside, slamming the door behind him. \n\nThat moment, the silence of it, that was Betty's favourite part. She could see their eyes but they couldn't see hers. She knew all that they were thinking by the frenzied adjustments of their face. The pastor, already quick to realise that yes, this was happening, that yes, there were masked devils armed with knives in the room which yes, stank, because it had been smeared with shit and blood, was now realising lots of things in rapid succession: my wife and I are being attacked, we are defenceless, the state of the house! The state of the house was vile, the state of the house meant this wasn't a robbery, these people mean to murder us, I must fight back. Betty watched this series of thoughts occur to the man, and upon seeing that final spark of defiance light up his dazed eyes, she jumped towards him, presenting her threat, waving her blade, and the pastor stepped to meet her and Stu punched him in the side of the face, and the pastor fell over.\n\nBetty and Stu's eyes met and shared the anticipation of the violence to come. Then they set to work. The first steps were usually common to their killings, administrative mutilations gotten out of the way before the fun could begin. The first and obvious was to cut the achilles tendons so they couldn't run. Then, depending on what they had planned, they would either tie them to a chair or table, or cut off all their fingers and let them try to crawl around to escape or fight back with no legs and no hands. Incapacitation first. Then the main course.\n\nThat night's menu included torture and symbolic distribution of remains. The pastor was tied to a chair around the shoulders and shins, then they made him pray. Betty bound his hands together at the wrists while Stu held a knife to the wife, then she hacked off his fingers in a few hefty swings of her blade. Leaving the pastor moaning and bleeding, Stu and Betty, Betty and Stu, tied heavy rope to the wife's legs, and, throwing the end of the rope over a delightfully rustic exposed beam, together lifted their victim to hang directly in front of her husband. \n\nThe local police could only tremble in awe at the atrocities perpetrated upon the couple before they succumbed to blood loss. What was done to whom, in what order, and for what purpose was obscured by the extremity of the resulting crime scene. All that was certain was the way they were found by their neighbour. The pastor, tied to a chair, his legs hacked off at the knees and the thighs, so many stab wounds to the torso that it was hard to determine their number, his genitals destroyed, and his head removed and replaced by that of a cat. The wife, hanging by a single leg, eviscerated and splayed open at the belly, a crucifix taken from the wall and stabbed into the dripping stump of her other leg, her innards arranged precisely in the bloody pentacle painted onto the plush living room carpet, and a cat's head placed in pride of place in her exposed crotch. Her face was also removed, and missing.\n\nIt was Betty's idea to frame the son. On the Friday before Stu and Betty had walked down Main Street waiting for inspiration to strike. Taking in the homely charm of the town, they strolled arm in arm, smiling at nothing in particular. Ahead of them they saw a man bend to talk to some bum with a cardboard sign and a hat filled with change. As they drew closer the man dropped a few coins into the hat and actually shook the bum's hand. Stu was filled with nausea. Betty's eyes narrowed and focused as she realised the man wore a clerical collar underneath his plain shirt. As they passed the pastor he greeted them warmly. \"Welcome strangers! If you're still in town Sunday and so inclined, we'd welcome you at our humble church!\" He smiled at them sincerely. Stu swallowed his rising gorge. Betty was filled with a righteous hatred. They smiled. \"And even if you're not the church-goin type, well you'd certainly still be welcome to come along and try some of Mrs Tibbutt's sweet cakes.\" He smiled at them voluminously. Stu bravely smiled back but he knew if he opened his mouth bile would spew out in one form or another. Betty said \"Yeah, sure!\" in a tone calculated to be enthusiastically ambivalent, a tone she knew a pastor in a small town would recognise. He did, and, smiling at them again in a way that tested Stu dearly, turned to take his leave. \n\n\"Hi, dad.\" The pastor was momentarily taken aback by the appearance of this hairy son in a leather jacket. Betty's narrowed eyes spotted the disappointment and disapproval in the pastor's face. She watched as his false dogma smoothed over his animal nature, watched the false god spread lies into his mind directly. The pastor was momentarily taken aback, but in the next moment, \"Son.\" His face assembled itself. Betty saw all. She saw what the pastor felt, and she saw what the pastor thought he should feel, and she saw the pastor pretend to feel what he thought he should feel. Lies. She pulled Stu to the kerb and pretended a conversation. They would hear this.",

                                            "comment": "\"Dad, I could really use your help. I know what you said last time, but really, I'm serious. Look.\" He was wearing black jeans and a Black Sabbath t-shirt and a black denim jacket and his hair was scraggly and unkempt. To Betty his face spoke of hope and she hated him from the corners of her eyes. The hairy son held out a letter. The pastor took it. \"It's a real job interview Dad. They know about the conviction and they're willing to give me a chance. I just need to show up early Monday morning for induction, but it's a long drive. Can I take the other car tomorrow? I thought I'd drive out to Welter Rock tonight and camp, maybe do a little fishing in the morning. Then I'd leave late in the night and get there on time in the mornin'. Have the car back to you by Monday. O' course, if that's goin to cause you a hassle I can also just take it Sunday night.\" The hairy son presented himself as contrite. The pastor's pretend face slipped a little, and for a moment some semblance of fatherly pride passed across his face before the proscribed feelings took its place. Betty knew what he would say before he said it. \"Son. Of course you can take mother's car for this,\" he held up the letter. \"I'm proud of you.\" Stu retched.\n\nBetty made a small show of providing a handkerchief for Stu to 'cough' into, and they turned to leave. But not before they heard the hairy son agree to return the car Monday evening. Betty's narrowed eyes began to formulate the plan. As they walked away Stu looked at her with a green face. \"Them.\" Betty nodded. \n\nIt was easy to follow the pastor to his house. It was easy to find and kill cats in the residential peace of a Saturday morning at 4am. It was easy to find workable masses of dogshit on the suburban afternoon streets on a Saturday.\n\nAfter the main entertainment of the evening was concluded, it was easy to write on the wall, in the joined blood of the victims, a lyric from the band Black Sabbath: Look Into My Eyes, You Will See Who I Am, My Name Is Lucifer, Please Take My Hand.\n\nStu and Betty didn't think much of Black Sabbath, preferring the Partridge Family songs or The Osmond Brothers.\n\nSo, victims placed or strewn according to plan, house and home defiled and bedeviled by symbols of power, and a big, fat, obvious clue-arrow pointing at one obvious person with no alibi.\n\nBetty and Stu left that town late Sunday night and didn't arrive anywhere after three tanks of petrol. So they decided to stay there for a while. The pastor and his wife had elevated them from Life Path 11 - magical prowess and spiritual awakening - to Life Path 13 - now they were teachers with great insight. Such were their thoughts. Betty's introduction of the framing of the son was clearly a direct inspiration from the Lord Himself. Now they were ready to take on greater challenges. But here, there, here in this place they found themselves in, they would take a day to enjoy themselves.\n\nStu and Betty had pulled up in a suburban street. The car was shaded by spreading foliage and the weekday unfolded around them. They saw a young man mowing his large lawn at an offensively early time. They watched cars emerge from tree-shaded driveways to all turn in the same direction towards the nearest CBD. The following suburban quiet gratified them in a way they had come to recognise. This unwalled fortress of security, this peace and quiet, this mundane certainty of the continuation of all that is normal, was fertile ground for despair and discord. In this glorious psychosis they greeted the sight of Mrs Morecombe's waddle down the garden path. Betty's narrowed eyes took in the fat woman's isolation in a glance. When Mrs Morecombe opened the lid of the letter box, Betty saw in her gaze in her stance the expectation and then swiftly the disappointment. Betty's narrowed eyes sucked up the scene of Mrs Morecombe's glance around the street for witnesses. Stu, near euphoria in his revelation of the destruction he would soon cause, still had presence of mind to note the old woman's apparent weakness. He laughed, then he turned his face to Betty and laughed.\n\nBetty was way ahead of him. She looked into her lover's smiling eyes. \"I have a fun idea.\"\n\nThey spent the night in the nearby woods. Betty traced a pentacle into the dirt with her foot and they fucked within it. They felt Satan to be close. They copulated as animals. They fucked for Satan. They desecrated love with their bodies, and were satisfied in the knowledge that Satan would be satisfied. These were their sacraments to satisfy Satan, even if Stu did not satisfy Betty. As Stu often reminded Betty, intention is the basis of magic. This nearly satisfied Betty, and she reminded herself that Satan was satisfied by her desecration, which was best for all concerned. Anyway, Betty had her fetishes ready. Stu had been trying his hand at whittling recently, and was not showing any promise. Despite his inability he had still managed to carve two small figurines out of palm and these Betty had secured before he could whittle them away to nothing. Using a section of hessian sack she had saved from the prize of drowned kittens she had once pulled from a river - hoping to find saleable goods in its promising bulging fullness, happy to find the death of innocents - she cut some crude vestments for the figurines, man and woman, and secured them to the dolls with bobby pins. Then she thoroughly anointed the dolls in the unguents of her desecration.\n\nThe next break of dawn found Stu and Betty already masked up and waiting behind Mrs Morecombe's house, fuses blown and phone line ripped out. This time would be all for Betty and Stu. Betty couldn't wait to see the woman's fear at the note and the dolls. Stu couldn't wait to begin his day-long worship of Satan through the infliction of pain. Betty couldn't wait to see the progression of despair across the stupid, fat, old woman's big, fat, jowly, stupid face as Stu did his work. It was a holiday. And while this time they knowingly acted in the service of their own pleasures, they knew that Satan approved and would be watching.\n\nIt was going to be a grand day.\n\nStu and Betty heard the first stirrings inside the house not long after dawn. At first the usual casual knocks, the waking sighs, the disturbance of bed clothes and creaking of mattress, the complaints of floorboards. Then a short, loud sound. An odd sound, Stu and Betty bridged eyes through their masks at it. Maybe a belch. Then the sound began again, and did not stop. It was like a belch or a burp or a croak, some brittle sound emanating deep within a throat - the sound cut off. Silence. Then again the short loud sound, five times. Silence. Then again, five times. Betty and Stu looked eyes at each other. Was that a frog in the walls? It was like a cricket or a frog, chirping in a pattern. The sound repeated, five more sets of five. Then silence. They waited in stiff anticipation for another sound. Seconds drew out to minutes. They relaxed, must have been an insect. The sun rose further.\n\nStu and Betty waited. They heard the young man mowing his lawn offensively early. They heard a series of cars drive into hearing distance and out of it. Then they waited in the glorious silence, they reveled in the homely peace of the suburbs, they enjoyed the joy available, just as a masochist will take pleasure from the pain of a whip. Then they heard the front door of Mrs Morecombe's small house open. Stu silently moved around to one side of the house, and Betty the other. Now they could see Mrs Morecombe's slow waddle down the garden path. Without hesitation they quickly moved up either side of the house and met at the front door. Betty nor Stu had seen Mrs Morecombe exit her front door, there being a shabby hedge blocking its sight from the street, so Stu was ready with a set of lock picks. He put them away as Betty gently twisted the door handle and it readily opened. \n\nThey entered. Stu took a place in the living room, such as it was, and Betty took a place near the front window from where she could see the foul old woman's disgusting waddling. On the menu today was some mental tormenting, followed by prolonged physical torture. But Betty's amuse-bouche was to be the confusion and fear she was sure she would see in the ugly woman's face. From this perspective, she at first expected to read the posture - the note that Stu had scrawled, the nasty little dolls, the realisation that this situation, in this letterbox, in *her* letterbox, was aimed at her. It was aimed at her security, her home. It was an attack - then, she expected to see the fat woman turn in fear and waddle, with her laughably greatest speed, back towards the house. It was those moments where the old, fat, ugly woman would flee to what she thought was safety that Betty longed for. The moments she would watch the sequence of fatalistic reasoning play out across the meat's face. Betty gripped her blade in anticipation.\n\nBetty, avid, drank in the scene. Mrs Morecombe tipped back the top of the letterbox. She gazed down into it. Then, she pulled out the note, this Betty could see, though the woman's back was turned. The old woman's posture didn't change. She reached into the letterbox and pulled out the dolls, this Betty could see, though the anxiety and fear Betty expected to see manifest in the stiffness of the woman's back did not appear. The moments of Betty's anticipation drew. Then the woman replaced the dolls in the letterbox, almost lovingly! Then the woman turned.\n\nBetty did not see fear, nor confusion, nor consternation of any kind. Betty's narrowed eyes saw a burgeoning, a swelling of this woman's being. They saw a renewal of hope. They saw something growing in the core of this woman's vast bulk. She turned to the empty doorway that Stu waited behind. \"Plan's changed. We pain her to death. She's stronger than we thought.\" Stu, his face itchy from the mask, made a noise.",

                                                    "comment": "Betty turned from the window. \"I'm going to her room to find something to use. When she comes back, incapicitate, and I'll make an entrance. I want this one.\" Stu made another noise. \n\nMrs Morecombe's bedroom had a bed in it. Wooden floors marked with dark stains. A large wooden rocking chair. The bed was a spring mattress with a single sheet upon it. Betty lifted the mattress, lifted the sheet which seemed stuck to the mattress in places. Looking around the room she found no personal items, no photographs of family, no framed pictures of lilies. Nothing to indicate anything but that something lived here and slept on this mattress.\n\nThe front door closed. Betty froze. Footsteps. Betty knew Stu was close. She heard some clicks from the kitchen, followed by a sigh, then she heard Stu's confident step into the old woman's line of sight. Betty waited for a scream, and Stu must have waited for a moment too, but then she heard the sound of a closed fist hitting flesh and felt the glory of the night to come. This night would be terror and pain, followed by an attempted conversion to Satan's ministry. Held out like the hand of salvation, simply succumb to Satan's embrace, the pain of this world ends and an eternity of Satan's grace awaits! Betty was enamoured of her plans and her power. Stu was enamoured of Betty, and of the power he gained in her service. They were a power couple, and they really thought they were killing it.\n\n---\n\nMrs Morecombe was punched in the face by a man wearing a devil mask who had suddenly appeared in her kitchen doorway. It wasn't a great punch as punches go, but she did cop a strong hit to the bridge of her nose, and her confusion was replaced with a red chaos, where she dwelt for some time as her body waited. Everything went red and remained that way for some eons for Mrs Morecombe, who dwelt in a place which was not a place and where eons and seconds were contrary synonyms. The eons passed quickly there, and Mrs Morecombe used them to remember eons past, and dealt with those memories sequentially for the first time again, and became again what Mrs Morecombe always was. And she laughed. During those eons, she laughed a lot.\n\nIn the meantime, Stu had bound Mrs Morecombe to a chair. Mrs Morecombe, sitting in a chair, was a multitude of bulges, swellings and folds. While standing she had the appearance of a woman with a naturally large stature gone to major fat in later age. While standing she appeared hearty and hale and likely to have a stroke or a heart attack in the next few years. While sitting in a chair, bound at the ankles, arms pulled back as far as possible and tied behind her back, and her head strapped to the chair, her chest and belly bulged out in a smooth near spherical curve. \n\nBetty, returning from her failed search for personal talismans with which to manipulate her victim, resigned herself to pettiness and spite. One of her favoured personas was someone she called 'high school mean girl'. It was a simple caricature, but fun to play. High School Mean Girl was petty taunts delivered in a smug tone, with every few taunts being particularly, obnoxiously ridiculous. \"You have, like, all the crabs.\" These outliers intended to provoke a rational defense, perhaps \"I'm 64 years old, I haven't had sex in years!\" Then Stu would step in, \"Yeah fuckin dry old bitch.\" Non-sequiturs designed solely to fuck with the victim's rationality; this tactic frequently worked on the elderly who were easily browbeaten into submission. If nothing else it provoked the fearful confusion so dreaded by the elderly, but on a rare occasion it would reveal a vulnerable, willing soul which could be turned to the cause.\n\nBut that morning Betty entered the room like a devilish cheerleader, all judgement and flighty spite, throwing aside the mask like a dance move, readying her meangirl stare, and the first look she flashed at Mrs Morecombe was like a finger trap. Her spiteful eyes caught those of the woman in the chair and, sensing vulnerability, strained her eyes to push contempt further into the softer spots. Betty felt her power and strove to drive it deeper through pure will, through her gaze she would drive her intention, through her gaze - \n\nShe could see the eyes. The eyes were her home. Betty gazed deep into Mrs Morecombe's eyes. Mrs Morecombe forgave her for everything. What was Betty broke into pieces to be examined by the vastness of Mrs Morecombe.\n\nStu watched his love enter the room like a fashion model on a runway. She cast aside her mask and stared provocatively at the meat in the chair. Stu loved it when Betty went Diva. Stu loved Betty in all ways, but he particularly loved the extravagance of the Diva persona. It was Betty's true sexual nature, he was sure of it. The brazen sexuality and the untouchable, hand in hand. The power of it. He knew that it was Satan that lent her this lasciviousness, and he thanked the Lord and the lady equally.\n\nStu watched Betty flash her eyes at the meat in the chair. What an avatar of sly, of spiteful, of nasty. He gloried in her. She did not move. She did not move. His gaze moved to take in her face, and in it he saw a sickening beatification, she was dead. She was dead and she stood there, provocative and sexy, a corpse. Betty's corpse wrenched her drying eyeballs towards Stu. Stu could not look away. He stood there, a mockery of a possible true power upon his face. Betty's slutty stance jilted, some foundational bone snapped like a twig. \n\nStu was frozen, solid, stiff. Through some act of will he dragged his eyes away from Betty's failing form to focus upon the fat old woman they had tied to a chair.\n\nWhat was left of Mrs Morecombe's face retained a recognisable smile of satisfaction as it seemed to deflate and fall into the body beneath. Bright circles appeared beneath Mrs Morecombe's blouse where breasts might ought to be, and as the deflated human head fell back into the quivering bulk, those circles became eyes, and Mrs Morecombe returned to her ancestral form. The legs bound to the chair bulged, and burst the now flimsy binding, strong thighs developing above a knee that bent the shins backwards. Her arms seemed to fall down her outside, and came to rest just above her thigh joints, the arms thinning out to fat, the hands expanding to fleshy pads. The eyes, visibly yellow through the blouse that still covered them, rolled meaningfully towards Stu.\n\nStu had just watched an old woman turn into something resembling a frog within a few seconds. His last cogent thought was \"I should run away.\"\n\nWhat was Mrs Morecombe's torso split just beneath the remnants of the blouse that still covered its eyes, revealing a lipped mouth from which sprang a tongue. Stu was grabbed and swallowed before he knew what was happening. He had other thoughts for a long time afterwards but they were and are infitely uninteresting and uniformly uncogent. The digestion process of an Elder is dissolution, yes, but time is not relevant.\n\nBetty's attempted foray into the depths of the mind of an ancient earned her a pocket existence in the everlasting being of Alfentar, whose majesty considered the infinity of the mean girl pose combined with the realisation of failure to be a fitting permanent monument.\n\nThe next day at 8.30am the local postie, having found in his daily allotment a package for Mrs Morecombe, decided to change his route to begin at Mrs Morecombe's. He knew full well that Mrs Morecombe checked her mail in the morning every day, for no apparent reason, and he wanted to surprise her. Everyone knew Mrs Morecombe was a bit odd, but she always had a smile for everyone who crossed her path. Maybe today he could make her day.",

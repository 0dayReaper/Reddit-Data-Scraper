A meditative insight is that you are not your thoughts so whatever comes out of your mind sometimes isn\u2019t in your control and isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of your Self. Psychologists and therapists know this but does a judge, an interrogator, or hell even yourself or your close family? You can have your brain gaslight too to make it admit guilt when you know you aren\u2019t guilty of something.",

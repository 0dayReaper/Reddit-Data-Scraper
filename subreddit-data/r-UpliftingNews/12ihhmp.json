You can't just do it once or twice and expect to be cured but if you go out and about most days, it's really eye opening. \n\nIf you're like me and thinking \"this is such stupid advice. Going on a walk isn't going to do anything\", I'd suggest actually try it and give it some time. There's tons of advice out there on how to achieve good mental health. Don't be like my past self and just assume it's all ineffective fluff spout off by people who don't understand. These things do work but you have to actually give it a go and give it time.",

It's by no means a cure-all or anything like that, but I stand by my opinion that sunlight, exercise, and exposure to the outdoors is ESSENTIAL to mental well-being. Humans didn't evolve to stay inside for 24 hours a day; extended periods are fine, and that's largely what the modern world consists of, but you NEED to make sure you balance that out with time in nature.*\n\n*again, this might not cure, or even significantly improve, your mental or physical state, but I honestly believe you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't try.",

Instead it involves taking medication and going to therapy and exercising and eating right and getting enough sleep. There is no silver bullet. All of those individual things will help but long term its about an entire lifestyle change.",

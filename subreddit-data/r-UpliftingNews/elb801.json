Of course you have to pay some full time workers who you need to operate the charity but it\u2019s quite larger than that. \n\nWhile the government is often viewed as inefficient, it\u2019s much more effective at covering overhead costs due to not having any high paid executives. \n\nCharity is fine in concept, but relying on it to fund necessary social programs is a recipe for disaster for multiple reasons.",

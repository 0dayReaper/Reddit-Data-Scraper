Hopefully the survivors feel a little semblance of healing even though this isn't nearly close to the full justice they deserve.\n\nEdit: Also to add, to all people who worked with him and paid him. They need their court dates in hell. Probably worth billions combined. Would be nice if the victims could take from them as well.",

It's good to hear that there is some healing, but money only goes so far and it would obviously be best if we made sure that there wasn't harm in the first place.\n\nI think getting corporate money out of politics is a good first step. Obviously easier said than done, but nevertheless I think it's a necessary step towards a lot of progress.\n\n[Here's a dashboard](https://www.quiverquant.com/lobbyingsearch/) I've been building tracking corporate lobbying, if anyone is interested. Sorry if you've seen it already, I think it's important data on an important issue and I've been trying to get as many eyes on it as possible.",

He stated that she is to the point that she doesn't have mental capacity to defend herself. It was a pretty comforting read to know that she wasn't in Martha Stewart prison.",

What a family of fucking creeps, Jeez.\n\nI really hope the thing about her cell, and her being minitored closely is true. Hearing a judge say \"No one likes Prison, But she can still prepare just fine from there, she will remain where she is now\". - was nice..\n\nJust can't help but feel like this is all a show sometimes. How do we know she's not just in a mansion somewhere? Look at the influence these people had.\n\nI want to believe that there will be Justice, but my gut is telling me to trust no one around Ghislaine Maxwell.",

Donald Barr was a perv and even published a fantasy book about teen sex slavery.  \n  \nBill Barr basically 'grew up' professionally with Epstein, and legally represented him. Epstien trafficked kids to Donald and Bill Barr. Epstein was the connection between Barr and Trump - and scads of high-level GOP persons.  \n  \nThe Republican party is rife with pedophiles who patronized Epstein and Maxwell - which is why Trump's Labor Secretary pardoned him of all charges when US Attorney in Florida.  \n  \nI hope Merrick Garland re-opens the Epstien/Maxwell case and does a full court press into the Barr/Trump/Acosta conspiracy which pretty obviously included the murder of Epstein in custody. It stinks to high heaven.  \n  \nThere are sitting Republican Senators and Representatives that serially raped kids furnished by Epstien and Maxwell and that Kompromat - to which Russia is a party - is a national security risk that represents a clear and present danger to the United States.   \n  \nNot to mention the thousands of women and kids raped in ICE custody and the hundreds of children stripped from parents that have been 'lost' (i.e., trafficked) during the Trump/Barr administration.",

Be it left, right, center, etc. doesn't make a shit. These fucks are on all sides, including whichever one you choose to subscribe to. If you can't point out that fact and only defer to your side and whatever you have been led to believe, you should rethink your decisions before spewing this one sided bullshit that you're obviously blinded by or have convinced yourself of. Any piece of shit, even those you choose to be on the side of, that's caught up in this, should go down. Basing your thoughts and decisions around which side of the aisle you're on doesn't make you any better than those that you speak out against, as even those at the top who you think are on your side and are trying to convince you, are all mostly cut from the cloth and don't give fuck about any one of us below them. This shit isn't some game where one side wins and the other loses. If it were, it's us the people, who may not all agree with each other, that have lost before the game even started. The reality is that these people view the world and us differently than the views we all have. The only \"team\" that anyone should be on, regardless of beliefs, is the team that can put differences aside and stand together against shit like this, or anything for that matter, that goes against the very fabric of our society. The ones you seem to put trust in are the same ones that are able to get away with this shit because of the naivete of the people that put that trust into them. It's not them who struggle with life in the same way you or I do. It's not them who suffer the consequences of whatever actions that have been put forth by them and are out of our control, much less if a crime was committed. They are not like you and me, and although we may have differences, we have more in common than you may think. Remember, there's more us than them. The sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be.",

This leads to alarm fatigue where officers end up too lazy to perform every 30 minute check because many inmates don't need them.\n\nJail Administrators pile on a huge amount of responsibility onto jail staff that they know is unattainable to cover their own ass that way when incidences like this happen, they can say \"See! It's the officer's fault this didn't get done!\" - so they have someone to throw under the buss.\n\nIt's very easy for a \"No isolation\" flag to be overlooked when you are moving hundreds of inmates around a day, and many inmates have 10+ notes on their file. \n\nWorking the night shift, I've come across officers that have fallen asleep at their station a few times, especially if it's 2 in the morning and there is nothing to do but cell checks. I always wake them up and report the incident if it happens multiple times, but nothing is done.\n\nI'm not saying this is okay, or should be condoned - I'm just saying it's a fact of working in corrections. What you guys see as blatant conspiracy, I see as the status quo.\n\nIf you want this to change, petition for more transparency and higher wages for corrections staff - *and campaign to reduce prison overpopulation*",

In 2020 footage of people sneaking on to his island it appears that certain parts have been altered and/or covered with the cement, such as 2 specific electric boxes in a shed. In addition, it's well known that he had a submarine and GM was/is a licensed sub operator. Lastly, I can't find the source RN but I remember reading a quote from one of his maids in 2003 that alleged there was an underground tunnel network with a map. Couple these facts with the nature of what he was doing, and the theory that he literally buried the evidence in cement is pretty damn plausible.",

Tesla is producing an end product for its comsumers full of other manufactured components and goods from varrying companies/industries. CATL on the other hand is a company built around lithium ion battery development and manufacturing. Id put more stake into CATL delivering on time, especially given that they dont have a poor track record for delivering on time. I dont think theyll pull a tesla as their reputation would be on the line.",

I don't have buyers remorse, not really, but I kinda feel trapped by the purchase. \n\nThat being said. I'll pay this off in 5 years. I doubt that anything better, (better value, better price, better performance) would be available in less than 2 maybe 3 years. I'm betting that the car will still be worth trading in when something \"better\"  does appear. And I really believe that 3rd party and \"do it yourself\" battery replacement services will start to appear in that same timeframe. If I could upgrade my current battery in a few years, for a reasonable price, I'd consider that over a new purchase. And by reasonable I mean less than 50% of what I paid for the car while doubling the range. That would make it a pretty sweet car. Kinda like when you used to be able to buy a hi-performance crate engine for your old truck and drop it in over a couple of weekends.",

Idk how exactly how that translates into size, but car companies may choose to put smaller batteries in to save space, weight, and cost without sacrificing range. There's a chance that they wouldn't fit an older car's battery slot without modification.\n\nIt's also possible that they just make new batteries the same size and shape and there wouldn't be a problem beyond the price tag of the battery. \n\nAnother possibility is that the technology here somehow stops them from making a battery in the same shape or with the contact points in the same place, which, again, would make it so they wouldn't be backwards compatible without modification. \n\nThe last thing I can think of is the likelihood that these batteries become purchasable by an individual in a meaningful time frame. Just because the next Chevy Volt has one doesn't mean John over there can find one of these to put into his old Volt. And even if John can find one in Silicon Valley, that doesn't mean that Jane can pick one up in suburban Wisconsin. Depending on how quickly CATL can scale up production of the automotive batteries, companies may not make them available for purchase to individuals any time soon. You might be forced to go through a dealership for a replacement if there's an issue, and dealerships might be barred from providing their (potentially) limited stock to people who just want to upgrade their older car batteries.",

There was an effective drug that was taken off the market due to a rare but serious side effect. However there was no other medication that could do what it did. The FDA was deciding whether it could be released back onto the market with a black box warning. I was sure it was going to get approved based on everything I knew about the drug, the drug market, the side effect rate, the efficacy rate, and much more additional data.\n\nI considered buying a lot of stock but I didn\u2019t know enough about investing so I sat on the sidelines and watched what happened.\n\nWhen the FDA made its announcement, I was right and the drug was released back onto the market with the black box warning as I expected. What happened to the stock price? It went down. \n\nThe moral of the story is investing is far more complicated than  \u201c good news equals stock goes up\u201d. Sometimes that\u2019s true. Sometimes it\u2019s not. If you have solid information that allows you to predict the outcome, other people do too. \n\nThe good news is I didn\u2019t bet a lot of money and lose big. The bad news is the WSB guys heard and said my brain isn\u2019t smooth enough to join their subreddit.",

Stopping can be annoying sometimes but we just put on Friends on the Tesla screen and wait it out. It\u2019s over before you know it really.

Plus if you install a charger at home like us and most people, you don\u2019t have to go to gas stations/chargers at all in everyday life. You wake up, car is chargerd, you drive, come back, plug it in, repeat. Honestly the 2 hours ish we\u2019ve probably spent at super chargers this year is a pretty great trade off",

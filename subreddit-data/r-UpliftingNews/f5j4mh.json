Essentially the easements own the development rights to the property and are very customizable. This is the best way to protect privately owned land when it\u2019s not in ownership by entities such as NPS, USFS, NFWF, etc.",

They buy the land they want to protect so no one else can exploit it. \n\nYou can actually pick exactly which projects you want to support. Although, as cool as it is to pick animals or ecosystems you want to donate to, I strongly encourage anyone who can to donate to [the Rainforest Trust Conservation Guardians](https://www.rainforesttrust.org/guardians-of-the-rainforest/). They may not look glamorous, but these are the local peoples and volunteers who are managing and protecting the land they buy. They get a lot fewer donations because it's not as cool, but these people really are the true heroes. \n\n[They have a 100/100 score of Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=11733) and are [Platinum Rated on Guide Star](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3500609). 91% of all fundraising goes to buying, protecting and managing land and at-risk ecosystems and species. 8% goes to fundraising efforts. 1% goes to administrative costs. \n\nThey constantly post blog updates so you can actually see the sanctuaries and protected lands they buy grow!\n\nI implore anyone who can give to donate! If you can sign up for a monthly donation, please join me!",

One lady from Karnataka (Saalumarada Thimakka) still tends to 300+ trees, and has planted over 8000 trees herself at 108 years old!!!! These are the people who have a heart.

It was probably chosen to be farming land because it was better for that than the surrounding land (which is now Tiger Reserve).\n\nOn the other hand: straight lines. The lushness just stops at the borders.\n\nI think they worked more with the water than we could read about (swales etc to help collect water).

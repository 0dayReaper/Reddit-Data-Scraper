Neighbors said in interviews that he had made homophobic remarks and hated the LGBTQ+ community. Rainbow-colored shooting targets in his house. He operated a handful of pro-\"free speech\" (read: pro-violence and racism) websites, including a forum that hosted a lot of anti-Semitic stuff and a website that advocated killing civilians.  \n\nHis grandfather on his mother's side is a Trump supporter, which was the only solid thing I could find about politics relating to him or his family. \n\nHis mother and grandparents refused to testify against him after he threatened to blow up the grandparents home and threatened them with firearms. \n\nHis dad (who had not been involved since he was young) admitted to encouraging violent behavior when he was young.",

They all knew a gay married couple and didnt make a big deal out if it. Now they go out of their way to make anti-gay jokes and mock things like pronouns and people using the womens room who don't meet their standards of femininity. It's been pretty dispiriting and disgusting to see how quickly they re-adopted this bigotry.",

DeVos, Tom Price, Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, Jared Kushner, and numerous others ran circles around Trump on policy while he was busy feeding his relentlessly needy ego. His decisions were completely inconsistent in terms of a national strategy on any given day with the only guiding principle for making them being how it made him feel about himself.\n\nThe guy took a goddamn sharpie pen to a hurricane path projection and drew it where he (incorrectly) wished/said it had gone because he's that fucking pathetic that he cares about such things and being seen as \"smart\" in the most pathetic, fourth grade way possible.\n\nYou support someone with the emotional development of a small child.

Reconciling a vote with some unsavory elements of a movement is a challenge for all of us yeah? We're looking at genocide rhetoric when most people concerned with trans issues just care about kids not being subjected to surgery &amp; what is widely believed to be unneccessary cross sex horomones (i.e. it should be a last resort, but some clinics don't treat it as a last resort.) This has culminated in California becoming a state where a parent can (Statewise,) legally kidnap their child and hold them in harbor in Cali if they are to transition. In response, DeSantis has created a similar law for those who won't transition, at least until they're 18. Shit's just getting wild.\n\nI've been denouncing it by accepting jokes for jokes (hell I'll even make some off color jokes every now and then because everybody gets a seat at the table when it comes to being a punchline,) but also pushing the fact that if MAGA starts gunning for abolishing gay marriage &amp; promoting violence against queer folk at large, their movement will die faster than a slug in salt. Yeah there are a bunch of people who *claim* that shit is widespread, but if it truly was, individual cases of lynchings would be national news, just like every unarmed black man killed by police makes national news even though it's like 8-10 per year despite millions of police-black interactions each year (still 8-10 too many, but I digress.)\n\n Simple answer: I do my best to police my own when I can. There is this weird counter-dependent relationship happening on both sides of the \"culture war.\" Take drag queen story hour--- hardly anybody gave a shit, and it's honestly been kind of a joke BUT there were some people who took umbrage to the fact. That's their right, however, the response to this umbrage is for a few people to double down in inappropriate ways, ultimately culminating in sexualized outfits (I wouldn't want a cis bikini babe reading to kids either.) Pro-DQSH folks towed the line, blindly accepting or even denying this phenomenon to \"own the cons.\" Then umbrage was shown, this time by a group of folks a little bigger. Then \"kid friendly,\" drag shows happened. Now we've entered completely inappropriate territory, yet to most who blindly support owning the \"bigots,\" it's not a big deal because they get to see the people they hate seethe.\n\nI'm worried that this methodology of not policing your own, currently widely accepted by those who claim to fight  bigotry, will only push more people away and radicalize them. Even scarier, folks on the right are beginning to adopt this philosophy. Monkey see, monkey do after all. Most folks DO want to be left alone, but when such egregious acts are taken to target children--- you've got yourself a moral dilemma. I am but one man, but I work my ass off to make sure that the issues at hand are focused on, and to not let creeps derail the conversation into \"well this all started with gay marriage so we should abolish it,\" or promoting physical violence. Harder to do on Reddit than most sites because of the upvote/downvote bias, but it's important to say my piece &amp; clown on the *actual* bigots who think they're my buddy just because of my vote.\n\nAs for my vote, I don't vote for symbology. My key voting issue is sex trafficking, which had seen a significant decrease under Trump's presidency. There are a slew of other things he's done that have secured my vote for him in 2024 but that's not what we're talking about so I'll leave it at that.\n\nThanks for asking.",

In what world do you think rich people with power, liberal or conservative, would give up the ability to have power over others' bodies? You're delusional.\n\n&gt;I'm worried that this methodology of not policing your own, currently widely accepted by those who claim to fight bigotry, will only push more people away and radicalize them.

Liberals, conservatives, nationalists, and fascists alike fought in the White Army of Russia, while anarchists and communists squabbled in places like Kronstadt and Makhnovschina. \n\n&gt; We're looking at genocide rhetoric when most people concerned with trans issues just care about kids not being subjected to surgery &amp; what is widely believed to be unneccessary cross sex horomones\n\nThe right loves, loves, L.O.V.Es (Yes it's love (a little Nat King Cole, eh?)) to make up imaginary enemies to rile up the base. We saw this with Jewish Cultural Marxism in the Weimar Republic, we saw this with the famed \"missile gap\" of the 50s and 60s (The USSR had maybe a few dozen missiles at the time), the list of principled communists (McCarthy lied), the mass fear of a slave revolt in the 1850s, the myth of the black assailant (Credit to The Birth of a Nation), the \"Satanic panic\", and now with CRT, the \"LGBTQ+ agenda\", and the \"deep state\". The latter may exist, but it's a product of the capitalist corporatocracy we live under, both the DNC and GOP are guilty.   \n\n\nJews were somehow a force that could topple the entire German economy according to the Nazis, yet depicted as weak cockroaches and rats to be killed. Now, trans people are both sissies who cry and throw a fit when misgendered according to right-wingers, but also capable of transing your kids? Make it make sense.  \n\n\nTL;DR: kids already CANNOT get surgeries or hormones. They can get A. a social transition, changing name and pronouns, and/or B. puberty blockers (which are also used on cis kids to pause early puberty, before the age of 10), which are practically fully reversible. You want kids to commit suicide. Let a kid be called what they want to be called, ok?",

I'm on the outside looking in, and from outside it's the high-level, policy-driven, ideological views that make most noise.\n\nThe big, big problem with putting people in power with such views is that it empowers people on the extremes, and Trump himself is going that way - he is way farther to the right of the centre than anyone in Biden's policy and influence circles are towards the left. Sure, some leftist will be empowered if democrats win, but I think the actual policy influence is minor. No one is invoking Mao, Pol Pot, or Stalin on the left, whereas Nazi iconography is everywhere on the right. And importantly Dems policies seem to be about inclusion, access and letting people live and let live (which once upon a time would have been a key objective of republicans - no longer unless that's a Christian god-fearing life).\n\nI myself would vote for a centre party almost every time. Having no clear option, I would go for the lesser evil. From the outside, it is very clear which one is the lesser threat (to people, institutions, and society).",

During the Nazi rise to power, liberal and conservative members of the capitalist owning class were the key financiers of the Nazi project. The NSDAP catered to them by being the main virulent opposition against social democracy, socialism, and communism, ideologies which when implemented, would gradually or radically strip power from the rich.  \n\n\nThe right will collaborate if it means the left won't win, while the democratic socialist SPD helped put down communist and socialist uprisings during the German civil war. If you have 10 leftists not adhering to maoism and 1 maoist at the table, they will argue all dinner. That's the difference. \n\n&gt;Meanwhile people are mourning Audrey Hale.\n\nYeah no. They aren't. Either you made that up, or you saw one random twitter acc with 3 likes post that and are using that point of view as a straw man for the entire left. Dishonesty runs deep in the right, doesn't it?",

They saw my post and decided to take the opportunity to apologize for the hurt they caused and then revealed that that night was a revelation for them and they have completely changed their lives in the three years since.\n\nPeople can change.

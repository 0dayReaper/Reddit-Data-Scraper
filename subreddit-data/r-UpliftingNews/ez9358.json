There is a maximum amount you get paid per month though, so if you earn a lot, you will generally lose some money when staying home.

But this is for health reasons for mother and child. Fathers get additional 2 weeks paid vacation at birth to support the family at home.",

Average cost for all pre-natal and post-natal care factored in with the delivery cost: $30,000. \n\nI live in Germany. I pay \u20ac350 a month for private insurance and have a \u20ac300 yearly deductible. I had a very complicated pregnancy and complicated delivery (no C-section though).\n\nSo I only paid what my monthly insurance costs and my deductible total was. This amounted to: \u20ac3,450. \n\nI had to have a lot of ultrasounds, was put on bed rest, needed extra tests, had a 4 day hospital stay, and had a midwife come visit my home after the birth for 8 weeks (standard here in Germany).  Paid under 4K for very extensive care. \n\nThen, we actually have affordable childcare here too. My son is now 2 and both my husband and I are back working. He\u2019s in care from 8-4 every week day, the care includes 2 freshly prepared meals, a snack, drinks, diapers/wipes for those that aren\u2019t potty trained, and materials for all craft activities. It costs us \u20ac320 a month. Most of my US friends would pay at least $250 a week for that same level of care.",

This is for a variety of reasons. So I pay more than a lot of people on state healthcare pay. \n\nOur daycare facility is also private. If our son was at a state funded one, the bill would be much less. But childcare is hard to find here. Too many babies and children and not enough facilities. So most of the state-run facilities are kept for lower income/need-based families at the moment. Once our son is a little older, then his care becomes assumed by the government. I think when he\u2019s 5?\n\nWe also get Kindergeld (monthly money for having a child) which helps offset his costs.",

Labor, hospital, everything is free, including a post natal visit. I had a private specialist because of my previous gynaecological issues, she's top of the class. Extensive PRIVATE health care was less than a 1000 euros, private midwife for labor included. If you don't have my issues, you can easily have it all be free.\n\nAfter that, I have 1,5 years long maternity leave. For a year I get paid my salary level, and after that it's half that approximately. Husbands get two weeks off,paid,but they dads can go on parental leave instead of moms. So either way, mum gets 2 months off post labor, paid. And after that, you choose who goes on leave. Its pretty awesome.\n\nThe problem is state financed childcare. We have free education, so state has to provide kindergartens for free. There are rather long queues to get into them, so until they get in, you've got to go for private kindergartens or other private care. For us, a great kindergarten with just 8 kids in it and two teachers costs 150 euros per month, food and crafts included.\n\nIt's pretty awesome.",

If there would have been need for a longer stay, it would still have capped at 600\u20ac for the entire calendar year (and a second 600\u20ac for either the other parent or iirc the kids collectively). If you have no savings and low income, social security just pays for it all and the personal cost is 0\u20ac.\n\nAll pre- and postnatal care is free at the point of service, as are the regular childhood checkups iirc. There is one home visit at about 10 days after the birth iirc; 8 weeks just seems unnecessary to me, but I guess it's the practice in Germany. Also, in Finland midwives pretty much do only birth-stuff; the maternity clinics are staffed mainly by other nurses specialized in that preventative pre-natal and infant care, plus some doctors. \n\nVoluntary supplemental insurance is a possibility, but wouldn't be used for these services, but rather e.g. cases where the kid has an ear infection or an upset stomach or something, and you want to see a doctor ASAP and go to a private clinic.\n\nDaycare prices are set by municipality. In Helsinki iirc they cap at 270 \u20ac/month if household income is above about 4400 \u20ac/month, and are free under about 2900 \u20ac/month. The price between those is 10,7% of income exceeding about 2700 \u20ac/month (but small fees of &lt;25\u20ac are basically rounded to zero, hence the 2900 above).\n\nMiddle-class taxes are roughly the same as Sweden I think, roughly 25-40% depending on where in \"middle class\" you are. Unlike in the US, taxation is always personal.",

The poor all have medicaid for no cost which covers 100% of all expenses. The well off have extremely good insurance which costs a bit but compared to their income isn't anything bad. It's the middle class who get fucked hard by the costs though. The people who make too much for state healthcare but not enough to afford great insurance instead pay for insurance which basically does nothing unless you have an excruciating accident and accrue and unbelievable build. My wife has insurance through her job(which pays about 40k a year) and even though she pays a good amount, the deductible is so high that it doesn't cover any of her prescriptions or doctor visits for the whole year. She has to pay the first 1900 out of pocket for doctor and first 4k out of pocket for medication before her insurance covers anything. So yeah...not great.",

Deaton and Kahneman's study is from 2010, where they found the limit at $ 75k, but according to an online inflation calculator that's actually about $ 91k in 2020.\n\n&gt; Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. **Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone.**\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489\n\nAnd I think there's probably also some correlation with income and health (and education).",

It's not really that surprising though that, after nine months of pregnancy and the widely known benefits of breastfeeding, the mother is interested in continuing the relationship, as opposed to handing it off just for the sake of equality statistics.",

                                    "comment": "It's not a paradox, it's an effect of current modern family model.\n\nTaking care of children was never meant to be one person's job, not for humans. One huge reason why humans developed such close-knit societies was because compared to other aninals, human children required so much intensive care that it wasn't feasible for one person to do it independently with no help.\n\nTake a look at any unindustrialised society - they don't live the way we do. Mother's don't \"stay at home to take care of children\", firstly because there's no concept of \"staying at home\" since there's no strict division of \"home\" vs \"public/work\" spheres, those only became established after industrial revolution took various types of work people used to do in their home home into factories and created modern capitalist employment system that we know today. Secondly, because mothers weren't the only ones taking care of children. The whole multi-generational family lived in the same house (which was still very common even in the West until mid 20th century), or very close. People lived in small, close-knit communities, where they knew their neighbours all their life and could depend on some of them as much as on their own family. Contrary to popular sterotype, women did a lot more than clean, cook and take care of children. Cleaning standards weren't anything close to what they are today, and women had tons of other work. Children were encouraged to be independent as early as possible. All of the family pitched in taking care of children, and even friends and neighbours too.\n\nIt's ridiculous that today we have this idea that the mother should be the only person spending most of the time with her children, while in truth children actually benefit from having multiple caregivers. And you can bet most mothers actually want more help, not less. I don't know about Austria but I've lived in several countries in Europe and in none of them do most mothers want to \"stay at home\" when they go back to work and get some help with the childcare. Sweden is called one of the most gender equal counties in the world and 80% of mothers return to work after one year of leave. You mention breastfeeding, but the vast majority of women today only do it up to a year, certainly nothing close to three years. One year also tends to be the upper limit of paid maternity leave for that reason. There's no real benefit to anyone of having the mother stay home for several years. If she doesn't work crazy hours, she can still have plenty of time to spend with the child after work, just like fathers do. And maternity leave is often an extremely isolating time for mothers, many of who can't wait to go back to work. Not to mention the benefits of not having one partner shoulder all of the financial responsibility. As I said, this \"dad works, mom stays at home\" divison is a modern and artificial concept, nothing to do with \"natural gender roles\". Before schools existed, fathers were the ones teaching their children a lot of stuff, which also included taking young children to observe their work and spending time of them and taking care of them.",

My sister and her husband took the time a little lopsided but my sister has a more physically demanding job and needs to be 100% before going back to work.  \n\nMy best friend, however, was told by his boss that my friend should definitely use that time because bonding with your newborn is an experience you don't want to pass up - especially since it is his first child. \n\nIt obviously doesn't fix the gender wage gap immediately but it helps and as the next generation takes over upper management positions, it will become more commonplace for couples to split their maternity/ paternity time.",

So there is stats to prove that fathers here do take the offer and it doesn't need to be forced.  \n\n\nThe law is also written in a way that is gender-neutral so that in same sex couples if they are giving birth the law makes a difference between \"birthing parent\" and \"non-birthing parent\", not \"father and mother\". If they are adopting, they get to choose who gets the mother's leave and who gets father's leave. Also, single parents get the whole amount so that in total the child benefits the most out of this.  \n\n\nIt also should not be mandatory to take the leave as government should not dictate how families split responsibilities. The old law did not allow for an equal split, this one does. The only next step needed is for the amount transferable to be 100% of the leave if the parents so choose.",

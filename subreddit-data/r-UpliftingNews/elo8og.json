They\u2019d probably say they haven\u2019t released a good album in 25 years and that the improvised solos on Hardwired were bullshit\n\nEdit: Ive personally never considered \u2018Heavy metal\u2019 a sub genre because thats literally the name of the whole encompassing genre. Metal is just short for heavy metal.\n\nEdit: Do not quote the sacred texts to me, I was there when they were written",

It's like as soon as they got mainstream popularity with the black album, every fan became a hipster. Load and Reload were a definite miss with just a few solid tracks. St. Anger I call the album that should not be. I tried to like it. I really did. But it was just trash.\n\nSo they gave people what they wanted. They can't go back to being 19year olds on the emerging thrash metal scene. It's not going to sound just like their 80s work again. But it's as close to their roots as they're going to get, and I would argue is even better as Death Magnetic and to some extent Hardwired now has more maturity and complexity to it. \n\"Fans\" that trash all of their new stuff are just bitter middle aged assholes who haven't liked anything new since 1990.",

Although there are protests coming up demanding his resignation, personally I think this is a bad thing. It gives the LNP (the party who\u2019s broad inaction helped lead to the current situation) a \u201cfresh slate\u201d to continue what they\u2019re doing and to just indirectly blame Scotty for any residual mess. It also normalises this idea that a party can sacrifice a figure head, claim they\u2019ve changed but continue doing what they\u2019ve been doing.\n * Morrison continues as PM and makes some token gestures to fix things and steals ideas from the ALP, like funding the water bomber fleet. Come election time in 2.5 years he\u2019ll splash around a lot of cash, get his mate Rupert involved and everyone will forget what happened and he\u2019ll have a good chance of staying in power.\n * The same as above, except people won\u2019t forget and the LNP will be voted out. There are other factors at play here too like a slowing economy and wage stagnation that could help swing the vote.",

The government is corrupt and we are NOT a free country, but you won't hear this in mainstream news feeds because people like to tell themselves the west is free and would rather focus on media distractions like China as opposed to the very real destruction of liberty happening in the west. They're using another countries \"worse\" behaviours to slowly introduce the very same concepts here.\n\nWe can only protest where the government allows it, defeating the entire point of a protest which is AWARENESS.\n\nDon't buy into the faux freedom. It is entirely up to the government which issues matter and it's buried under vague wording of laws. \n\nhttps://www.sbs.com.au/news/time-politicians-did-something-greens-mp-among-arrested-at-kirribilli-climate-rally",

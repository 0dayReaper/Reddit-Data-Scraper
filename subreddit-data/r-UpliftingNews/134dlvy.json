I'd rather sit here and sob for hours with insomnia and panic attacks because I hate the way I am treated and looked at for taking diazepam. They make me feel like an awful drug addicted failure when I need a rescue med for anxiety. Some days I wonder if this is worth all the awful way I feel everyday. I got help and was shamed that diazepam helped me. I am too afraid to try any more. I'm tired of arguing with people who don't know me sitting sobbing at 2am hyperventilating. That is already embarrassing. Then to have the nurses and doctors at an er call you a drug seeker when you are begging for help has made me stop asking for help. I can't face it anymore. Over 20 years of this idk why now this is suddenly overwhelmingly hard to continue. \n\nVery sorry for that ramble bullshit. Holy hell.",

Anxiety can be crippling, and there is no shame in admitting to it - it is not embarrassing, we just don't understand fully how anxiety works and how to best treat it. It does affect all kinds of people.Please ask doctors for help!  I had anxiety, and the drug that was supposed to help caused migraines and asthma for me, so I don't have a medication option. So if something helps you, that is great! \n\nI just wonder if ER might not be the best place? Would it be possible for you to get more regular healthcare with a more compassionate doctor?

So I am super proud of my ancestors for being prehistoric savants, but their success has put a lot of us in the unenviable position of not being able to enjoy a safer world.\n\nFor many of us the only time we actually feel ok is when we are struggling through the more difficult parts of our lives, it's when we finally reach the promise land that we crumble under the crippling fear that it will all be taken away. It's a pretty cruel disease.\n\nStay strong everybody, unfortunately there isn't an alternate universe we can step into that is easier, this is the one we have. If you are able to quiet your mind (I am only able to do this occasionally) you realize how lucky we actually are.  \n\n\nEDIT: CRISPR this shit already, I want to feel better!",

The anxiety really broke for me in the last year, but I always got overwhelmed easily. Impulse control has never been an issue. I feel over reactive, lack of feeling present, and probably just depression with occasional crying fits (I'm a male that usually buries that shit). It's definitely genetic because I'm following my mom's mental spiral. Just gotta surrender to the doc and hope they take me seriously.",

Now my creative and obsessive mind makes up scenarios of how I am going to die, or my family members are going to die. Really rough. One thing I can pass on though, is stress management. My stress levels directly correlate to increased anxiety. Do everything you can to keep your days calm, your body rested and exercised. Exercise works like a benzo. An hour of decent exercise can knock 30% off the top of your anxiety. Really glad to hear you are ready to get help. Best of luck to you and if you ever need to rant, DM me.",

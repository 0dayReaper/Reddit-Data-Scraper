            "comment": "Because CO2 has to be in ballance with everything else. The oil we burn was sequestered away from the system for millions of years, so the system got used to that. Now we are adding this extra carbon back into the cycle. CO2 is absorbed by plants and the water in the atmosphere and oceans. The plants can use that carbon, but to offset the extra carbon, we would need more greenery, or the ocean will reabsorb the extra carbon over time. When water absorbs CO2, it becomes carbonic acid. This is what is causing the acidification of the oceans, which is wrecking corals and kelp forrests. \n\nMost of the oxygen we breath was released through photosynthesis in the ocean. Kelp, and phytoplankton produce around 80 percent of that oxygen. If you've kept an aquarium, you know that plant and animals in the water are super sensitive to fast changes in lots of parameters like temperature, salinity, O2, CO2, and and PH. The carbon cycle has a powerful affect on many of if not all of those parameters.",

I guess you're right, in either case the net change will be roughly 0, which means a fixed area of kelp that no kelp is taken out of might manage to keep a fixed amount of carbon on average. It won't continually increase the amount of carbon it captures as it lives on, but it should be around the same amount for it's whole life so long as it's healthy and protected.\n\nOk, fair point, better than nothing.",

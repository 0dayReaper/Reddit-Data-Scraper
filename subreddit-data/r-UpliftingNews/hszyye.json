It has been around for 168 years. So it has some weight considering it was around before the term spam or the people calling it spam. That helps but old institutions can fall. \n\nFactual reporting - [very high.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/)\n\nMedia Bias - [Center](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reuters)\n\nRated as [Centrist news](https://libguides.com.edu/c.php?g=649909&amp;p=4556556)\n\n##2 People reported it as a Rule #1 Violation. Don't be a dick.##\n\nThis is factually reported news. [Dr. Mark T. Esper](https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/Biographies/Biography/Article/1378166/dr-mark-t-esper/#:~:text=Esper%20was%20sworn%20in%20as,of%20the%20Army%20from%20Nov.), the Secretary of Defense said this. \n\n##2: It's targeted harassment at someone else##\n\nWho? Anyone that serves in the military signs a contract saying they agree to follow orders and adhere to a code of conduct. No one is forcing you to join the military and you are free to fly your racist flags as a civilian (you are not free from the consequences of those actions though.)\n\n##1: It's promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability##\n\nI agree. The various versions of the Confederate flag do promote hate based on identity or vulnerability. I thought the  \"Supreme White Race\" is superior and not vulnerable?\n\n1: Not uplifting news\n1: uplifting??\n1: uplifting to faggot cucks\n1: How is this uplifting?\n1: not uplifting\n\nAgreed. Not uplifting to racists.\n\n##1: It's rude, vulgar or offensive##\n\nYou racist snowflakes are so thin skinned! \n\n##1: Encourages or incites violence##\n\nHow?\n\n##1: Reposted article##\n\nAll you have to do is post the link where this was posted in r/upliftingnews before this was and I'll take this down. \n\n\nKeep in mind before you reply to this if you break the one rule you will be banned so review the sidebar before commenting.",

Although it is not an academic institution, by using the word \u201cuniversity\u201d in its title PragerU implies that the right-wing messaging they spread is factually correct and expert-driven. A number of PragerU\u2019s videos spread anti-Muslim rhetoric and conspiracy theories.*",

By demonizing the Confederacy, they make the Union (and therefore America) look all the better by comparison. They gloss over the fact that the Emancipation Proclamation only applied to slaves in rebellious states, and not to slaves in Union states like West Virginia. Lincoln went to considerable lengths to differentiate his personal views (slavery is bad, all men everywhere should be free) from his political decisions and priorities (if I could preserve the Union by freeing some slaves and leaving others in bondage I would). PU gets to paint him with a more simplistic brush. I haven't read a lot of sources that imply the North was fighting with the goal of ending slavery--I imagine their goals, and level of will to keep fighting, changed dramatically throughout the war.",

Misinformation channels are sources for information 75%+ of the time. That's what makes the 25%- so dangerous.

So in the general population, 57% disapprove and 41% approve (at the time of the study about this time last year) whereas among veterans it's 41% disapprove and 57% approve.\n\nThat said, a lot has happened in the last 6 months that has REALLY hit Trump's approval ratings in a big way. So I'd wonder whether any of that has impacted his ratings among veterans. For example, he's been really trying hard to hurt the postal service, which is like the largest employer of veterans in the country.\n\nSo those figures are a year old, and it's very possible they're now inaccurate.",

Idk if down south there are troops that feel comfortable with the legitimate mounted Flagstaffs on their trucks.. I imagine that's not allowed or you'd get weird looks going through the gate to get on post...\n\nBut the military is not displaying Confederate flags. I've been to northern, southern, and western continental US installations and never seen an official Confederate flag displayed by the military. \n\nThis new law just dictates that individual service members cannot display it. Something that you, as a civilian, are allowed to do. But military is held to a different standard. The 1st amendment does not fully apply on post.",

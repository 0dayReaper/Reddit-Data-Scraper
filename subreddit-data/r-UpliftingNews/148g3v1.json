In the process of dying, it\u2019s common to have long apnoeic episodes or pauses where you aren\u2019t breathing. Your pulse will be weak and your heartbeat slow. There are variations in how different places train doctors to determine someone is dead\u2026 but it boils down to confirming they have no heartbeat, they are not breathing and their eyes do not react to stimulus. I confirm death by listening with my stethoscope for a prolonged period of time ideally in a silent room. \n\nMore than once, I\u2019ve been caught by surprise when a patient suddenly gasps. It takes every fibre of my being not to jump especially if family are present. So usually, I try to wait fifteen minutes after the point a patient is first believed to be dead.\n\nIt\u2019s rare and it\u2019s something you\u2019d potentially get in trouble for, but it does happen. It\u2019s why the miracle of Christ rising from the dead never seemed particularly miraculous to me. The state of death would be even more subjective 2000 years ago.",

They don\u2019t bother embalming or anything since that\u2019s costly. Preserving bodies and storing them is also costly. So What probably happened was the family was expecting her to die, and got all the arrangements made. The doctor probably witnessed a lack of pulse, and no breaths and declared her dead. Somewhere within a few mins of her death declaration, she got a heart beat again and started to probably agonally breathe here and there. But not enough frequency for anyone to notice. \n\nThen at the showing when lots of eyes are on her they notice her breathing (agonally) in the casket. Who knows if she\u2019s actually \u201calive\u201d. She might have anoxic brain injury if she was indeed pulseless for a few minutes. \n\nLike these breaths she\u2019s taking doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be walking around telling stories tomorrow. She might be in a vegetative state.",

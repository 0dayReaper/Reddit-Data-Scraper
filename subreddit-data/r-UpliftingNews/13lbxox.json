I'm tired of watching school board meetings where the members are geriatrics with one foot in the grave making decisions about the future that they won't be held responsible for, because they won't be part of it.",

They have full voting right and is the representative for all the students. The only thing I disagree with is the last legislative session the state gave them the right to vote on the budget. I\u2019m fine with them having input on the budget and being able to voice their support/opposition to the budget, but having a student directly vote on whether their teacher gets a raise or their school gets a renovation seems like a massive conflict of interest",

American school systems have been absolutely wrecked by several years worth of recent events (I'm not arguing they were great before, just that there's been a sharp decline in recent history) and the children it's meant to help shouldn't be the ones who have to fix it. Like awesome he wants to take the initiative and make a difference, but this big of a difference shouldn't need to be made in the lives of our students.",

This was at a meeting I asked for during early/mid sophomore year, specifically set up for advice on what I need to do to improve my chances. She made me wake my ass up on a random Tuesday when I didn't have AM classes and walk across campus, just to tell me \"you have no shot, pick something else\". Having no one in my life who had gone to medical school, I didn't know any better. \n\nTrue guidance would have been \"here's a few things you should do to increase your chances, but let's talk about some backup plans if it doesn't work out\". \n\nLiterally signed the contract for my first adult job as a fully licensed physician less than thirty minutes ago. Fuck her and all the \"guidance\" counselors who confuse this kind of nonsense with being \"realistic\".",

Made it 4 weeks without a problem, averaged 94/100. Then I went to office hours because I was having difficulty with a homework assignment. Id tried the problem 20 times and gotten 20 different answers, so I knew I was missing something.\n\nWell. The professor told me I shouldnt have come to office hours, and I should know where the tutoring center is. I explained that it was my first year and I didnt know there was one.\n\nThen she told me \"I dont teach freshmen\" and that I would never be a successful engineer. She then made my life in class so difficult that I had to drop the course with a W. Took the honors version of the class instead the next year and learned more than I ever would have in her class. Got an A-.\n\nI got my first full time engineering job before I graduated. Got promoted a year later. 2 years later I made senior engineer.\n\nAnd 2 years after I took that class? Her FRESHMAN daughter took her class. Fuck that bitch. Ive always wantes to march back into her office and say look at me now.",

The point was, rather than getting this kid into the right school for their goals, this school chose a pointless run up the scoreboard exercise to create bragging rights for the charter school which is incentivized to literally minimize spend while maximizing state funding revenue since it can go into the owner's pocket. I looked at the budget for a local charter my friends' kids attend.  50% goes to instruction and 22% goes to admin and a not insignificant goes into a misc bucket.  Public schools are over 60% to instruction on average. Somebody got a Benz out of this.  \n\nOut of over 100 colleges this girl got into, the one with the best offer for her major was essentially a non-competitive school.  There are something like 6,000 colleges in the US.  The 49th best schools (UGA/OSU) have 40% and 57% acceptance rates. I'm guessing if she landed with any money at any of those schools which have an education program, she'd be there instantly. \n\nFor any of the \\~20-30k accepts to the Ivy leagues each year, how many of the other \\~5,994 schools would those kids have gotten into if they applied?  Probably 70-80% of them but few would bother because there's no point.",

If you\u2019re thinking about graduate school, look at the acceptance rates for people graduating with a bachelor\u2019s from the school you\u2019re interested in. Some have more than double the national average.\n\nOn top of that, some schools have better programs than others, or more research and industry/academic networking opportunities, or all three. If you already know what your field is going to be, there are state schools that excel in it. It might not be in YOUR state, but  it\u2019s a thing. Think agriculture, engineering, communications\u2026 I bet a few non-ivy schools come to mind. You want to go to one of those. You want your future employer to raise their eyebrows and say, \u201coh, State. They have a good program.\u201d\n\nOn top of THAT, if you\u2019re gay or latina or Mormon or disabled or the first in your family to go to college , some schools are going to have more support than others. Some schools have a higher retention and graduation rate than others because they work at it. If you\u2019re surprised to find yourself going to college at all, that\u2019s worth looking at.\n\nAnyway, I think it matters.\n\nYou\u2019re working with people who went to prestigious schools. As someone who went to a prestigious school but has a lower-tier job, I gotta tell you - this is unusual among the people I went to school with. Lots of graduate degrees and interesting jobs with that bunch.",

The name-brands manage waitlists and can manage their expected yield better, but idk how many of those this student applied to.\n\nWhat he is wasting is a lot of admissions officers' time, when I worked in admissions (95% acceptance rate), every student who came through from applying to reading to acceptance to financial aid got at least 2 hours of my time over the admissions season, even if I knew from the first sentence of their essay about wanting to become a veterinarian, that they'd never come to my school, which offered literally zero science degrees. But I still had to process and read their application, and generate and send all their emails and acceptance packets and financial aid information.\n\nAnd people wonder why there's administrative bloat in colleges.",

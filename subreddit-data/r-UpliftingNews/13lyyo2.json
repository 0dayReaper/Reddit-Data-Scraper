I wanted energy independence. And I got it through EVs and solar arrays. And I\u2019m so confused by Republicans who are simultaneously saying they want energy independence but fighting those things. It\u2019s a direct contradiction that makes no sense. Fighting them also contradicts the supposed desire for a free market.\n\nI always backed energy independence and a free market. That used to align (better) with the GOP. They still give it lip service, but then actively fight against it.",

It wasn't an in depth case study.",

There is no world in which continuing to add ghgs to the atmosphere is better for you. None! If you're under 30, global warming **will** fuck up your life. Maybe you get incredibly lucky and can spend huge amounts of money holding it together but it **will be worse** than the costs of prevention. \n\nSociety had a chance to build the tracks before we went down them but that was 40 years ago and they threw it away. Now our only option is to replace everything everywhere all at once and hope we're fast enough and don't miss anything critical. Anything less, and we're fucked.",

I know for a fact a lot of the current electric car charging stations at hotels etc do not produce enough electricity for a full charge despite being plugged overnight. I know the current administration had talked about getting electric charging stations available along all major highways at some point but that will require soooo much time to even plan let alone install. It\u2019s not as black and white as you seem to think, again, which is why I\u2019m not keen on jumping two feet in. Everything sounds great in theory, just not realistic in the immediate future. I\u2019m excited but apprehensive.",

At least in the US, manufacturers are going to stop making Internal Combustion Engines by 2035, that's only a decade away. If 25+ years hasn't been enough time to figure out how to effectively recycle a \"small\" amount of LI batteries, what do you think is going to happen when there's a shitload more? Also your \"there hasn't been enough time\" argument doesn't really hold water, if it was profitable for companies to recycle them, they would have done it years ago.",

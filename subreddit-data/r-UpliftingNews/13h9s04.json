You generally just use the standard English 'bang an s or es on the end' unless there's some special rule in play or a different form has already been grandfathered into common use from the original language. (Like how cactus-&gt;cacti was inherited from Latin)\n\nIn the case of platypus, the root of the word is Greek, who would pluralise it as 'platypodes'. But we don't speak Greek. 'Platypodes' isn't already in general use in English and so it can't really be said to have been grandfathered in, and so we just treat the word as regular English and use the standard English plural - platypuses.\n\nIn Australia, at least, news and science will always refer to them as platypuses.",

Maybe some snakes or lizards that would prey on their eggs, but that\u2019s a natural part of the food chain that\u2019s being restored. The bigger risk would be foxes, but they are extremely heavily controlled in RNP. Any wild animal is at risk of predation but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t return them to the wild",

All of these risks are much lower in RNP than many other areas that platypus are found. These ones were relocated but Taronga is developing a breed and release program so if this is successful i am sure more will be added in the future",

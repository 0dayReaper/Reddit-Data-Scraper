                    "comment": "Hey, you seem to have misunderstood Austrian law, so I\u2018m here to clear things up. \n\nRape is a crime defined in \u00a7201 of the Austrian Criminal Code (StGB) as:\n\n\u201eSomeone forcing another person, *by means of violence, deprivation of personal liberty, or threat of immediate violence towards life and health*, to perform or tolerate sexual intercourse or an equivalent sexual act [\u2026]\u201c. \n\nSo, rape is not just sex without consent, it is forcing sex by violent means. \n\nOther sexual acts that are not equivalent to sexual intercourse are a crime under the same circumstances according to \u00a7202 StGB.\n\nHowever, \u00a7205a StGB makes the mere  \u201eviolation of sexual self-determination\u201c a crime. \n\nIt\u2018s defined as:\n\n\u201eSomeone performing sexual intercourse or an equivalent sexual act on another person *against their will, while exploiting their predicament or after previous intimidation [\u2026]\u201c.\n\nHowever, since \u201eagainst their will\u201c is an explicit part of the definition of the crime, the culprit has to be aware of it. If it is not one of the other two cases, it has to be evident to any reasonable third person that it was performed against the will of the victim. \n\nFor more detail, here\u2018s my translation of the part in my old criminal law textbook I dug out for you: \n\n\u201eThe opposing will might be expressed explicitly or implicitly, for example by the victim starting to cry. But the opposition must be evident for the average third spectator. A mere internal opposition means the perpetrator is not punishable. A No can be turned into a Yes by persuasion. A perpetrator deceiving the victim into performing sexual intercourse willingly, (for example about their financial situation or willingness to marry) is also not punishable under \u00a7205a: Errors in Motive do not mean No to sexual intercourse. [\u2026]\n\nThe opposition to sexual intercourse [\u2026] must also be part of the internal intent of the perpetrator. An error benefits the perpetrator.\u201c \n\nOn the case of \u201efreezing\u201c: \u201eThe opposition to the sexual intercourse is not evident for the culprit in this case, depending on the circumstances.\u201c \n\nPerforming other sexual harassment, but not intercourse or an equivalent act, against the will of the victim is a crime defined in \u00a7218 StGB.\n\nHere, the sexual harassment must be \u201eunwanted\u201c and that fact that it is unwanted must be part of the internal intent of the perpetrator.\n\n*All citations are my translations, either from the StGB or the *Bertel/Schwaighofer* textbook on Austrian Criminal Law Part 2, 14th edition.* *Citations of the literature and decisions of the Supreme Court have been omitted for clarity and brevity.*\n\nAs you can see, Austria by no means has a Only Yes means Yes approach, but very much follows common sense here.",

                    "comment": "You have quite a poor understanding of what consent is. You do not need to verbally ask your partner to put your penis into her, but she does need to express enthusiasm and agreement.\n\nThis could be any and all of the things we know and love about sex: taking her clothes off for you, touching you with enthusiasm, being an active participant in sex, verbally saying yes, or wanting more, or faster, and engaging in the act with you, or any number of ways people show they are interested, and engaged in a sexual situation. It also includes the continuation of that interest and engagement, and the understanding that sometimes sex stops, or doesn't start for whatever reason. \n\nNo means no laws require people to actively resist their rape in order for it to be classed as rape. If a victim/survivor can't say no, or fight back, which may occur for a multitude of reasons, then the act is not counted as rape. For example, if your partner was crying, and not looking at, or engaging with you during sex, but she didn't specifically say no, then it would not be classed as rape. \n\nWith yes means yes laws, if the victim/survivor is not actively engaged in the sexual act, such as the examples given above, then it can be considered rape under the legal definition. Which seems like common sense to me. If a person I am wanting to have sex with, is not really showing any interest in wanting to enjoy themselves in the same way, I wouldn't want to have sex with them, because, you know, being desired back is sexy.\n\n Yes means yes laws still mean the victim/survivor would have to go through the entire arduous and traumatic experiance of reporting a rape, but places the onus of explanation on the perpetrator, as to why they did not look for these very clear signs of consent, and if they were unsure, why they didn't just ask.\n\nIt asks \"why were you having sex with someone who wasn't consenting and engaging with it?\" rather than \"why didn't you say no when he hurt you?\"\n\n\nAnd really, it boils down to saying 3 words, \"do you consent?\", I think everyone in the world is capable of doing that before engaging in sex with someone. Why wouldn't you want to be sure?",

What about the marginal sex that is very real and normal in many people's lives?\n\nWhat if someone has pretty exhausted sex, or relatively apathetic sex (as with a struggling relationship), or even one partner putting in the work to please the other one even though they're personally not feeling it. Would those not be classifiable as rape?",

Ongoing consent can be as simple as defining the situations you would want to have sex, and the ones you wouldn't, with your partner. Checking in, obviously, like \"hey I know you're tired, do you want to be doing xyz right now?\" or \"hey, I know things are a bit stressful for us lately, is sex something we want try to see if it helps?\"  even a discussion about \"going through the motions\" type sex. All of this is consent.\nA partner choosing to put in the work to please another even if they aren't feeling it, is also consent! \n\nRelationship consent can become blurry when people are in unequal power dynamics, without a clearly defined consent agreement.  For example, \"marital rape\", where someone feels they are owed sex due to the nature of the relationship. People may do acts they do not wish to do, because they fear the alternative, or the are motivated by what they recieve for it. \n\nA domestic violence victim may have sex with their abuser, and \"play the part\", so to speak, because having sex ensures they do not get physically abused. This is moving into more difficult territory here- coerced consent is not consent. But defining coercion isn't black and white. \n\nI think it's much harder to draw a line here, especially when we start to look at the various motivations for having sex, and try to apply a clear border around which of those are coercive.\n\nIs having sex when you're not totally enthusiastic about, because you know it improves and builds your relationship, coercive consent? Is having sex because your partner is interested, and you don't really mind either way, coercive consent? Is having sex because it's your partner's birthday, even though you're rather bored by the idea, coercive consent? \n\nI think that's where a lot of people get stuck, and conflate the really individual decisions about these sorts of consent grey areas, with what laws are put in place for.\n\nThe main thing that drives the application of these laws, is a victim/survivor who feels they have had their consent broken. In the types of circumstances above, it's very very unlikely that those people would feel they were assaulted. (with the exception of the domestic violence victim, who, most would agree, was in an abusive situation, and thus, may feel violated due to being forced to pick either their safety or their sexual consent. This is why laws exist to protect people who are more likely to be in situations of unequal power, regardless of their outward signs of consent)",

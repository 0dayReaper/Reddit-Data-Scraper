All it would require the farmers to do is end manufacturer liability on illegal tamperings but signing a legal assurance they won't illegally tamper with environmental safeguards (the DEF system).\n\nThere's really no government answer on where liability goes with this.  Does JD still get to collect service contract fees (that were part of the sale) if they're no longer doing the services?  If someone deletes the tracking on their DEF system should JD immediately tell authorities?  Has the state invalidated all of the warranties that these tractors were sold under and cost farmers millions of dollars in free service?\n\nThat's why there really needs to be clear federal legislation on this as well as potentially a ban on selling DEF deletion kits completely.",

Then, when that backfires because they're required to supply loaner tools like Apple was, they'll ship a huge box to your house any time you need to repair you tractor. Apple really thought that would discourage people, but it ended up costing them a ton in shipping charges because the box of tools was like 100lbs or more (once they realised it wasn't going to stop people, they paired it down to a box about 1/2 the size). I'm guessing they were also hoping that if any of the tools were lost or damaged they would charge the customer exorbitant amounts to replace it. I'm just now realizing that being an Apple fan is a lot like being in an emotionally and financially abusive relationship.",

The anti-right-to-repair lobby is incredibly well funded, so picking your battles is important, as we build laws and case law on the topic of right-to-repair. Colorado passed a right-to-repair bill for wheelchairs last year as well which was the first step in this direction. As much of a no-brainer as allowing farmers to repair their tractors may seem, similar right to repair bills failed in many states in the recent past, due to heavy lobbying from manufacturers (John Deere in particular). This is a pretty big step towards right to repair as it is one of the first major victories over an area that had a heavy lobbying presence.",

I'm sure there will be some trial cases where John Deere et al. try to test the bounds of the law, but this gives some real teeth to the enforcement if manufacturers infringe on the right to repair.",

Many family farms have been documenting weather for generations. The extreme weather systems of the last decade have made that pretty obvious to most.\n\nThe same shift has also been seen with actual hunters and fishermen. People who actually spend their lives outdoors and not merely just people who live in rural areas understand the impact of climate first hand.

A little bit more claim to be conservative overall, and they get a good amount of pandering from conservative funded media, but they often hold many otherwise leftist and progressive views also. Farmers have to be on top of science and technology to compete with the commonly sub 1% profit margins so they gotta be smart, resourceful, and always have an open ear to new ideas and research. And that generally means they see both parties as pretty shitty because politicians don't know jack shit about modern farming practices and needs and very few know about rural life in general either.\n\n\nBut the thing is, even in deep rural areas, farmers are still a minority of the population. You could be surrounded by crops on all sides for miles and miles and take a census of the area and find out maybe 2-3% of locals are farming any significant amount of products. Maybe an extra point if you include very part time work at certain times like helping bail some hay for 8 days each year. And that number continues to shrink as mechanization is continually increased to pure machinery and family farms are being forced to scale or die in competition with corporate farms that are pure scale and often over-utilizing their land.",

Much of what I did involved tracking incoming shipments/returns, factory returns/repairs, delivery monitoring, etc. I had to directly call into JD on a regular-basis for info on the tracking numbers we were provided by the JD dealers. When I say how tight-lipped JD is about everything they do, it\u2019s no exaggeration. It took me 2.5 years just to learn the basics from *dealers* of how their ordering program works (JDPOINT &amp; JDMINT) so I can provide instructions on how to look up parts info. We were given codes for tracking, but were given zero information on what the items associated with the codes were and often, the dealers had no idea what they were either. Try tracking an item listed as 0 for weight with no description \u2014 it\u2019s frustrating as hell and way too much work. The whole system between our two companies was a mess. I\u2019m not surprised JD fought so intensely on this bill so they can keep everything they do a complete secret from others.",

Because they have actively been fucking over farmers for like the last 10+ years. Unintended consequences, wonder what that will be. Cheaper and more accessible repairs? Weird how other \"Right to Repair\" laws haven't had any adverse to the consumers.",

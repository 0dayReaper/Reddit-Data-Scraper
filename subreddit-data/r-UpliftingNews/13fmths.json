The vet recommended euthanasia bc her prognosis was terrible and there's no cure for the cancer, so she was PTS on the table. I never got to say goodbye. I'll never understand how it happened so fast, or why something so rare had to happen to her. So sorry about your boy. GSDs are real special.",

They don\u2019t understand that your dog doesn\u2019t care whether your house is 600 square feet or 6,000, your dog will be right next to you. The house is not for exercise or play. Neither is the yard.\n\nDogs need physical, mental, AND social stimulation. They need to be around other dogs and people, strangers and friendly alike. They need to be presented with new experiences, on walks, car rides, in training. They need to have the chance to stretch their legs and run or at least walk, EVERY SINGLE DAY. This can be as easy as taking the dog for a short walk (15-20 minutes) three to five times a day (allowing the dog to greet people and sniff anything they like), taking them to a park for an hour, letting them ride along while you pick up dinner in the drive through. It\u2019s not a lot of work, certainly not more than children! And what a gift to have a companion. Having dogs really opens up a world of social opportunities for people without children.\n\nDogs who are not given these opportunities become highly stressed and agitated. They\u2019re basically living the equivalent of extremely boring solitary confinement, like, you know, what was stressing all of us out for the last 3 years? Only worse. As a result, they will develop (usually maladaptive) coping mechanisms. This is often destruction, chewing, etc., but it can also become aggressive barking at animals or people they see through a window. Dogs who are very, very isolated can become incredibly aggressive to other dogs and people, particularly when the owner is misreading, and then anticipating, a negative response. The OWNER is reactive, not the dog.\n\nAnd of course, dogs who are confined and/or bored are much more likely to run away. People are often surprised that my dog stays near me when he is off leash. (He is a service dog, so he is so well trained that he will not approach others, including dogs, or cross the street, without permission.) The reality is, his life is so incredibly happy with me, that he has no incentive to leave me. He has a job, a varied diet, new things to discover every day, new friends to meet, plenty of exercise, and so on. Why would he run away from that???\n\nAnyway, I get very upset when I see people who don\u2019t bother to do any research about dog psychology or behavior before they get a dog. At least this person is aware.",

They arent blind to the animal's suffering but back then there werent really many options. You dont have enough to sustain a whole litter, releasing them onto the streets (even in villages) will just get them killed anyway and most if not all your neighbours already have pets of their own so you cant give them away. Obviously this started way before the internet age so selling them off wasnt really an option either since even the people who attended city markets probably had pets as well. \n\nThis is all what my grandparents told me.

Some philosophers used to argue that consciousness was required to feel pain, and since they though animals as devoid of consciousness, then pain wasn't a thing for them. Even for veterinarians, until pretty late in the 20th century pain was just ignored. And it's only very recently that we've had conclusive evidence that they do indeed feel pain, in a way very similar to humans. So for common folks back then, animals in pain wasn't much much of a concern.\n\nWhere I live old folks used to put kitties in a bag with a few stones and chuck it in a river. Thank god we've (mostly) moved away from that.",

Back in 2015 Congress tried to pass a bill with strong bi-partisan support that would protect the person calling 911 for a drug overdose from being prosecuted for having a small amount of drugs on them. Because the person calling 911 in that situation was probably also doing drugs. Logical bill. If you think you are going to be arrested if you call 911 you are less likely to call 911.\n\nIt passed the Texas Senate 30-1. It passed the Texas House 140-4.\n\nAbbott vetoed it.",

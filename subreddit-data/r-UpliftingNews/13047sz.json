He's stubborn, has selective hearing, &amp; has 10x more energy than I could've imagined. Oh, &amp; if he eats anything besides normal dog food, he throws up &amp; diarrheas for 2 days straight.\nThat woman will be in tears by the end of the 2nd week. If I could choose again, I would have never gotten this dog. Bless her. Get her an elderly cat.",

Withing the first 6 months of having him, I had 2 Golden Breeders &amp; 2 Golden Owners tell me that it was going to be alright, they usually get better after a year. Unprompted. So I think I'll stick to my opinion based on experience rather that agree they're great because... you think they \"just have ADHD\"",

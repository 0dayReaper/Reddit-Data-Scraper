            "comment": "Way back when I was a kid who rode the bus to school, they used to have a day towards the beginning of the school year where they would give us all a safety lesson in case of a driver incapacitation. It included things like how where the emergency brake was, how to work the pneumatic doors manually, how to call in an emergency on the radio, and where the safety/emergency equipment is stored. I wonder if they still do those briefings.\n\nYoung me definitely envisioned myself stepping in and saving the day when shit went down.",

But yes, my driver gave us a chance to practice applying the emergency brake.  We all got to try it.  For just such an emergency.\n\nDefinitely a weird feeling.  You don't want the driver to pass out, but oh boy, that feeling of being a hero!!  Fortunately, never happened on our bus.",

Although unlikely, a medical emergency can strike at any time, even during the time allocated to driving a school bus route.  And even when a kid is trained, panic can still set in.  But it didn't.  And it's because a seventh grader was trained in what to do.\n\nI think kids are a lot more capable in an emergency than we might give them credit for.  Do we want them to experience said emergency?  No.  Can they be vital in the response?  Absolutely.",

It's been a long day.\n\nStill, this could've been much worse.  We could be reading about a bus crash that killed all the students.  That might be a bit of hyperbole, because it sounds like the driver was in the process of trying to stop, but there would've been some form of crash nonetheless.  No, I don't want kids to have to assist a driver during a medical emergency, but it could've turned out much worse, and it didn't.  I'll take the win.",

If they weren\u2019t able to figure out either of those or if there was a chance of it reoccurring then she would not have been allowed to ever return to a commercial cdl job until it was proven that it would not happen.

Especially that the bus driver is okay.\n\nBUT they may have to find alternative work for the bus driver. The bus company will be insanely liable for any accidents if they put that driver back driving kids. Their insurance company is not likely to allow it.  \n\n(Light headed and pulling over is fine. Actually losing consciousness is not. Especially now that it is international news.)\n\nI sincerely hope that the bus driver had a weird one off medical incident.\n\n(Aside: It was also weird that she called in BEFORE stopping the bus. Make the bus safe, then report in. However, I can see that she obviously did not expect to pass out.)",

Some of them didn't even know the bill existed.\n\nRubio brought the bill to the floor and asked for unanimous consent (in this scenario, only one senator needs to disagree to shoot it down). Generally when that happens, a senator has their staff call all the other senators' staff and let them know what it is and when they're going to do it. Apparently a few senators weren't informed by their own staff, didn't know what they were voting on, and didn't say anything. At least a couple of senators objected when they found out (Tom Cotton, Chris Coons), and they're trying to keep it from passing the House. The House might just let it die out of courtesy.",

He did modify the plan to make it universal in the general, but I have no confidence in his determination to make that happen.\n\nUniversality is also far from the only critical failure in our healthcare / health insurance system.  A great many Americans pay for health insurance that they can't afford to use.  Deductibles are completely unrealistic and prevent a huge number of Americans from seeking help when they should.\n\nThanks to the insanely complex nature of our for profit healthcare system, our government spending on healthcare far exceeds that of countries with single payer systems, we get far less healthcare, and the care we get has worse outcomes.\n\nTo put it bluntly, health insurance in America is a Mafia that is robbing us all, reducing lifespans, lowering our quality of life, and further corrupting our institutions.\n\nAny healthcare plan that doesn't eliminate the for profit healthcare system is the result of corruption.",

They know their product and after the Marlboro Man you'd think they would be looking at diversifying their offerings. They , big tobacco, could have been all over this and lead the market because they could afford to set up facilities. But no. Keep with the additive laden tobacco and kill off your customers.\n\nSame with forestry damnit. No reason plantations couldn't be become hemp. And with the problems with monoculture making an area toxic to the tree crops hemp might charge right through fungus areas no problem. But no. Plant monoculture and get an array of vascular wilts. Create habitat and then destroy it. Harvest ASAP for the $$$ and have crap lumber full of knots cuz the trees didn't have enough grow time to actually get hardwood.\n\nCoal. Let's strip this mountain for some stuff. And have company housing and stores so we are the economy. And there's some kids that can get in there easier so let's have some of them (not currently). These people are not going to last long so we need to be all that is available. Why the hell would we diversify? We got a good thing goin here! \n\nTo me this is the BS of capitalism.

Madison didn't really want to even have to write them but Hamilton was doing this and pushing some monarchist tendencies like president for life. You can also read the Anti-Federalist Papers to get a broader picture of the forces at play. Basically early on and throughout US History the monarchists/tsarists and their Great Game wanted to end these new markets and systems as they were a threat so many attempts were made.\n\n[I wrote another comment here with some other jump offs to research](/r/UpliftingNews/comments/ttw4wk/house_passes_bill_to_federally_decriminalize/i31lr76/).\n\nAny PBS, FRONTLINE or C-SPAN documentary about them is going to be good. \n\nI highly recommend reading their actual words where possible. They were close to tyranny so they understood balance very well and some things that might seem overboard but were clearly needed then and now to push back on those forces. \n\nIt is fascinating to learn that Madison also did the Bill of Rights to create the best feature of Madisonian democracy: individual rights.  It was a check created on federal and states taking over one another or individuals.\n\nHamilton did some good things like created the Treasury but also caused Madison and Jefferson to have to take like a year off because he was so much trouble in pushing things like president for life which would have completely changed America.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Madison and Jefferson did all the good things and Madison was the worker, he wrote the Constitution, Bill of Rights and the best Federalist papers. He was one in a trillion and completely changed the world and doesn't get enough respect.  He was flawed as every human is, but the country would be much, much different without him. Jefferson was the really good friend that helped a more worker/policy focused detail dude sell those things to others.  \n\nIf you do read books or docs, focus on Madison and Jefferson, it all stems from there.  Washington was also good but amazingly hands off.",

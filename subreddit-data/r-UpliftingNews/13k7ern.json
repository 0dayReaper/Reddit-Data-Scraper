            "comment": "\"A musician who was expelled from a Denver high school over 50 years ago received his diploma. Otis Taylor was kicked out of Manual High School in 1966 because of his hair. This was decades before laws ending racial hair discrimination. Denver Public Schools wanted to right a wrong\n\n\"I remember that day thinking, 'Oh, I'm out of school!'\" Taylor told CBS Colorado's Tori Mason.\n\nTaylor was 17 years old at the time.\n\nHe went to high school in the 1960s - and Taylor had style.\n\n\"You had to have that James Brown haircut. You can have all you want on the top, but you had to be clean on the sides,\" said Taylor. \"The whole school district was coming down on people who didn't look how they wanted you to look.\"\n\nTaylor's administrators gave him an ultimatum.\n\n\"Cut your hair or leave.\"\n\nTaylor left.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about me going into the janitorial business or something. I was trying to figure out how to do my music,\" said Taylor, about a moment 57 years ago.\n\nHe remembers how his parents felt. He says his mom was upset, and his dad was livid. After he was expelled, he went to California where his dad lived. He tried to get into a bar, showed his underage ID and went to jail briefly.\n\n\"My father let me sit there for three days. When I came out, he took me straight to a barber. I got my haircut!\" laughed Taylor.\n\nTaylor has been nothing short of impressive since. He's had over a dozen blues albums and the awards to match. But this week, eyes were on Taylor for a different tune.\"",

Things now are literally incomparable to how they were then. That's how far we've come. Are we perfect? No. Are we better and more tolerant than most nations around the world? Yes. The US falls in the 10-15 range on the least racist countries list, depending on which list you're talking about. This is better than Spain, Italy, and France, for example. And those are pretty damn nice countries.\n\nAll I'm saying is let's not be so at odds with reality here. We need to stay vigilant. We need to work on educating and reducing the number of dingalings around here with tiki torches. We need to work on systemic injustices that are indeed largely leftovers of another time (drug laws targeting black people, redlining, as easy examples).\n\nBut we AREN'T in some weird racist dystopia. We are in one of the most racially enlightened places in the world.",

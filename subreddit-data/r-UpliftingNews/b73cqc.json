Thanks for the gold and silver! \n\nOthers have pointed this out, but itd be impractical to have her read every book. I was being over the top. But a good little series of quests involving bringing her a few books that she reads to you...I think thatd be absolutely wonderful.\n\nI'm a nearly 40 year old guy and I'd sit in this game (preferably in VR) and enjoy storytime with grandma and probably break down and cry.",

Obviously, a real voice actor would be best because they can fuse emotion into their lines but for something like reading every book in Tamriel, I'd be more than happy with this.",

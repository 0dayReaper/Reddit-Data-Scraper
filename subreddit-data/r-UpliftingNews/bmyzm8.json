It keeps going on the ballot and they want it to stop. This decriminalization is supposed to be the state's version of a concession in the hope that it will slow the legalization push to a crawl.\n\nThe chair of the biggest legalization organization in the state has already publicly said he will not stop pushing or trying to get it on the ballot. Legalization has quite the minority support in the state because there is a large conservative constituency that is against it.\n\nSo while it may seem like this is pretty progressive for North Dakota, it only sort of is. The end goal is to head off full legalization in what has been a big fight between the semi-urban and Native tribal pockets of liberal voters in the state.",

A lot of red states are trying to nip this in the bud before it gains traction. A ban will likely be on the Florida ballot in 2020 as well.\n\nEdit: This has less to do with cities than it does with stoking fear about immigration and \"voter fraud\" to increase conservative election turnout.  A lot of conservatives are pointing to liberal cities in CA who allow non-citizens (different than undocumented residents (jfc its 2019 how dont people know this)) to vote in municipal elections as examples, but their motivations are likely more electoral based than limiting the power of cities to decide who votes in their elections.

In 2018 there was a fantastic initiative on the ballot which would have reclassified low level drug felonies to misdemeanors reinvested the money saved from reducing mass incarceration into rehabilitation and treatment programs. Some people voted against it using the argument that \"this is what the state government should be working on not a citizen initiative\" which is just completely bogus. There are a ton of things the people want to change that state governments don't. Personally I think every state should have a citizen initiative and the signature threshold shouldn't be overly onerous.",

Older people were that are more likely to be against it were already going to vote.   So ignoring their personally feelings on the matter current leadership might not want to see it on the ballot because they are scared it would attract individual that would vote for someone else even if they knew the bill was dead on arrival (not saying that is the case). \n\nThis is why if you are progressive or a liberal one of the best things you can do for your local progressive candidates is to get some progressive proposals on the ballot that will energy the progressive base.   Its just smart politics.  Make sure the proposal is worded in a way that motivates the progressive but doesn't send the conservatives into a panic, it helps to pick things that are generally popular that are not yet law because of establishment politics being slow to change.",

My dad saw it and instantly bought an NDSU tshirt as his own personal homage to you guys.\n\nNow its relatively common to see people walking around Philadelphia in NDSU gear. I'm not talking just his college Jersey I'm talking everything the bookstore has to offer. \n\nThis hasn't happened and wouldn't happen with any other player. It's truly a perfect marriage. We have so many big schools on the east coast that people wouldn't think about wearing college gear of a player from a different alma matter. For example Allen Iverson and Donavan McNabb are arguably the 2 biggest Philadelphia athletes of the last 20 years. No one and I mean no one went out to buy Syracuse or Georgetown gear to support them.\n\nTLDR: We got Fargo's and NDSU nation's back, yall are the new West West Philly. If any Aztecs try and start trouble we will be right there behind you.",

Fines very frequently lead to imprisonment. \n\nIf you can't pay, a judge might simply ordered you locked up. But thats illegal! you say. Well smarty pants, the ACLU has been suing its ass off since bearden v georgia because yeah its illegal but judges dont give a fuck.\n\nFurther, if you can't pay you will probably have your license suspended. Get pulled over, now you're going to jail AND your car is impounded with huge fees.\n\nDecriminalization is a scam. In Atlanta the prosecutors are upgrading $50 tickets for weed to $1000 ones + months of probation (what happens if you fuck up on probation-thats right-JAIL!).",

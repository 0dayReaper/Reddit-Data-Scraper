But you're severely underestimating how long that is for most people, which is why you're getting downvotes. 99% of people don't ever reach their natural limit, most people just don't want to deal with hair past their butt. As hair gets longer its under more stress, gets damaged more, and has more time to accrue damage. People with super long hair usually need to put forth a lot of effort to keep it long. If you treat knee length hair the same as chin length hair, your hair will get ripped out and that makes it seem like you hit a plateau, but proper care will let it keep growing.\n\nAnd as someone who's had hair past her butt and now has it about waist length, hair is heavy as fuck. Your head isn't designed to carry weight all day every day. So while it isn't heavy to pick up with an arm, its very heavy for your scalp and neck muscles to carry all day. Cutting a foot off my hair made a noticeable difference in my headaches and migraines. If I have my hair in a high bun/pony I'm bound to get a headache after a few hours, but if I have a braid there's no headache because the weight is distributed better",

For many people it's a way to express themselves and approach the world with confidence and pride. Natural hair is a bigger deal for the black community than natural skin because of the discrimination their natural hair has faced, hence why she probably personally has more pride in it with the state it's in. Things like this aren't usually about being \"without alteration\", it's about fighting back against oppression and embracing their identities. Going without make up doesn't do the same thing.",

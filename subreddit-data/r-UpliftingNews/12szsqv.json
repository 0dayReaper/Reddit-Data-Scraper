Starting today, she\u2019ll take a probiotic with cranberry! We give it to all our old ladies with dementia, and they stop getting UTIs instantly!\u201d And that was confirmation enough for me.

The obvious one is garlic : it prevents a lot of things, but especially worms. Well if you eat garlic regularly, you won't get worms, ever. You don't need to wait to have worm and use garlic as a worm killer afterwards. When I was younger, like decades ago, whenever someone happened to have worms in the family, the whole family would eat a lot of garlic to prevent them from spreading. It never failed.",

Researchers and environmentalists were desperately searching for a solution, until a group of scientists discovered a type of fungi that was capable of breaking down plastic in just 140 days. The discovery was hailed as a breakthrough and celebrated worldwide, with the hope that the end of plastic pollution was within reach.\n\n&gt;\tPlot Outline:\n\n&gt;\tThe book follows the story of a young woman named Sarah, who lives in a world where the discovery of the plastic-eating fungi has had devastating consequences. The fungi has become uncontrollable, spreading rapidly across the globe and consuming all plastic in its path, including the microplastics that have become embedded in human bodies.\n\n&gt;\tAs the fungi spreads, governments around the world are struggling to contain it. Panic and chaos ensues as people realize that their bodies are slowly being consumed from the inside out. Sarah, who works in a research lab, becomes obsessed with finding a cure for the fungi before it's too late.\n\n&gt;\tHowever, Sarah soon discovers that the government has been hiding a dark secret: they had known about the danger of the fungi all along but had kept it a secret to prevent mass panic. Sarah must race against time to expose the truth and find a cure before it's too late.\n\n&gt;\tThroughout the book, Sarah faces many challenges and obstacles, including government cover-ups, personal betrayal, and the rapid spread of the fungi. She must also confront her own fears and weaknesses as she struggles to save humanity from the brink of extinction.\n\n&gt;\tUltimately, Sarah succeeds in finding a cure for the fungi and saving the world from the brink of disaster. However, the book ends on a somber note as Sarah realizes that the damage has already been done, and that the world will never be the same again.\n\n*ChatGPT Mar 23 Version. Free Research Preview.

They discovered a highly efficient fungus known as Plastiphagus Decompositus, capable of consuming and breaking down plastic within just 140 days. Ecstatic, the world embraced this new solution, and the fungus was released in landfills, oceans, and polluted areas around the globe.\n\nHowever, the consequences of this miracle solution quickly proved to be disastrous. The Plastiphagus Decompositus rapidly evolved, adapting to its new environment and gaining a taste for the microscopic plastic particles that pervade human blood. As the fungi infiltrated human bodies, an epidemic of strange symptoms and illnesses began to emerge. Society crumbled under the weight of this new threat, and the remaining humans were left to adapt to a world plagued by the microscopic predator.\n\nPlot Outline:\n\nIntroduction: Protagonist, Alex, a former environmental engineer, is introduced in the midst of the crisis. Their spouse, Sam, has recently fallen ill with symptoms of the Plastiphagus infection. Frustrated by the lack of available treatments and desperate to save Sam, Alex sets out on a quest to find a cure.\n\nThe Journey Begins: Alex learns about a group of rogue scientists working on a potential treatment. With no other options, Alex decides to search for this group, venturing into the heart of the fungi-infested wastelands.\n\nTrials and Tribulations: As Alex navigates the dangerous landscape, they encounter other survivors, each with their own stories of tragedy and loss. Alex must overcome obstacles such as hostile scavengers, contaminated food and water supplies, and fungi-infested wildlife.\n\nThe Revelation: Upon finding the rogue scientists, Alex learns that the Plastiphagus has mutated even further, developing the ability to consume other forms of synthetic material. This poses an even greater threat to the remnants of human civilization.\n\nThe Cure: The scientists reveal that they have developed a genetically modified bacteria capable of neutralizing the Plastiphagus. However, this comes with the risk of creating another unforeseen ecological disaster. Alex must decide whether to trust the scientists and deploy the bacteria, or to find another way to save Sam and humanity.\n\nThe Climax: Alex opts to deploy the bacteria, but not before making the scientists promise to closely monitor its effects. The bacteria is successful in neutralizing the Plastiphagus, but the world is left with the uncertainty of the potential consequences of this new solution.\n\nResolution: Sam recovers from the infection, and Alex, now a leader in the survivor community, helps rebuild society with the hope of preventing future catastrophes. They work tirelessly to restore the balance between technological advancements and the natural world, ensuring that the lessons learned from the Plastiphagus epidemic are never forgotten.\n\nIn \"Plastiphagus: The Microscopic Predator,\" readers are taken on a thrilling journey through a dystopian future, confronting the consequences of humanity's unchecked pursuit of progress and the delicate balance between innovation and nature",

We design a lot of things, critical things, under the assumption that plastic will not rot. The insulation on the wires in your home, composite decking material, vinyl siding, basement waterproofing, sewer pipes, car paint... If we bioengineered a bacteria or fungus that could effectively break down plastics, it could be great for disposal... Unless it gets released, and the insulation starts rotting off power lines and the siding on your house rots away. \n\nI don't know, just a thought. Plastics lasting forever isn't great, but we still rely heavily on that fact.",

It\u2019s just the test sample.  \n\n&gt; It took 90 days for the fungi to degrade 27 per cent of the plastic tested, and about 140 days to completely break it down, after the samples were exposed to ultraviolet rays or heat.  \n\u2026\n&gt; Researchers will now try to make the degradation process faster and more efficient by tweaking key aspects of the process such as temperatures, the size of plastic particles and how much fungus is used.  \n\nSo it sounds like they are breaking down particles, right now.  \n\nThe plastics that they are breaking down, specifically, is polypropylene, which isn\u2019t regulated everywhere around the world the same way, and is\u2026 problematic.  It *can* be made to be biodegradable, and Western countries make it in such a way that it is photodegradable, but a good period is something like 600 days, and, again, it isn\u2019t regulated the same way around the globe.  Even if it is photodegradable, it would have to be actually exposed to the sun\u2019s light in order for it to break down, which isn\u2019t how that normally works in landfills, and then there\u2019s the matter of the additives used to make it photodegradable may introduce even more poisonous problems than we originally had.  \n\nSome polypropylene isn\u2019t biodegradable at all, and what does degrade not only poisons the soil and water, but does it over a matter of 20-30 years.  \n\nSo these guys - from what I can intuit (so take this with a grain of salt) - are envisioning something similar to Waste Management companies creating systems that use bugs to clean waste, but they\u2019ll use fungus and get rid of the nasty plastics in factories in a fraction of a fraction of the time it normally takes to degrade, and breaking it down this way won\u2019t poison us, like the natural process will, or incinerating the plastics, which others have tried\u2026 which just introduces problems elsewhere.  \n\nI\u2019m kinda going off memory, so take what I\u2019m saying with a grain of salt - definitely verify.  I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people who know more than me here, and I\u2019d love to hear from them!",

Are they saying that they would just apply it to an area?  Kinda seems like it.  \n\nI sure hope we won\u2019t be seeing a scene reminiscent of The Last of Us anytime soon\u2026. \n\nBut from what I can tease out of Old Man Google, that is unlikely, as the fungi used - Aspergillus terreus and Engyodontium album - seem to be fairly ubiquitous in plants and soil worldwide.  I am by no means any kind of fungus expert, however, so it\u2019s possible I\u2019m wrong and we might get to see a local reenactment of The Last of Us at a park near us!",

Using fungus to degrade plastics faster could be good thing but it depends on what your ultimate goal is. Are you trying to keep plastics out of the water column? Are you trying to limit landfills? We don't have a recycling problem, we have an overproduction problem IMO. Also, the faster you break down plastic, the more C02 you release into the air, and the less the manufacturers have to worry about cranking out ever more plastics if you find a nice \"green\" way to break these plastics down. \n\nI'd like to see a transition to plastics produced 100% from plants. that way the C02 nets out to zero and you don't have to worry about accumulation in the ocean.",

If the microbe digests plastic, it's just going to add to even more carbon in the atmosphere. You might as well be incinerating the plastic.\n\nFurthermore... the whole reason people use plastic is because it doesn't rot. Introduce a bacterium or fungus into the environment that changes that fact and hey presto, you've got a problem. The sealant used in your house's windows is now rotting. Your tent rots. Your polymer paints used to protect things from the environment rots. The plastic roofs on industrial buildings rots. Parts of your car rot.\n\nFurthermore, assuming that the microbe in question is a GM microbe and you release it into the environment, then you have a bigger problem. Horizontal gene transfer can result in unforeseen consequences when your synthetic genes combine with other, natural genes which already exist in the microbiome in unpredictable ways.\n\nThe pursuit of a \"plastic eating microbe\" is a passing of the buck by the powers that be, so that they can continue to dump plastics and say \"yeah, but a microbe will eat it one day,\" as if that absolves them of any responsibility or culpability.\n\nThe solution to plastic in the environment isn't a microbe. It's not dumping it into the environment in the first place. Recycle, reuse, reduce. As a society, we already know this, but we're so systemically lazy that we can't even do that and keep looking for another lifeform to do the work for us...",

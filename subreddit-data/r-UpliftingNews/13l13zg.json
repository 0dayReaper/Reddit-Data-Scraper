            "comment": "This whole news article is inaccurate. Petro removed the tweet this morning because the armed forces have not located the children just some items that show they made it out of the wreckage. The local press is giving him flack for it since it\u2019s obvious he was trying to use it for political clout. There\u2019s also the issue of the kids being lost for 17 days as of today, conflicting reports and the parents demanding in public for people to take this seriously since conflicting reports further break their spirit when they realize their children have not been found. Incredible how as time passes news outlets just simply pass on without verifying information as the norm.",

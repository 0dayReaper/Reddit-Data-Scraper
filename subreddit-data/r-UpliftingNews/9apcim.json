By the next decade, video games began to be marketed solely to boys, though they had previously been enjoyed -and marketed- towards both genders (this practice began after Nintendo decided to put their console exclusively in the boy's toy aisle). \n\nInevitably, the mainstream narrative became \"computers are for boys\". Schools began actively choosing men's applications over women's and hiring managers started requiring aptitude tests that were biased in favor of men. Men majoring in CS had a direct advantage from their upbringing and social expectations and the amount of lingering sexism in the field today is fairly disheartening. \n\n[NPR When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)\n\n[NPR The Forgotten Female Programmers Who Created Modern Tech] (https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/06/345799830/the-forgotten-female-programmers-who-created-modern-tech)\n",

So, the theory here would be that because computer programming became more important, less women ended up in the industry because more men become interested and ended up at the top of the queue. \n\nThis has been studied pretty well ... researchers have attempted to try and decide between queuing theory and \"devaluing theory,\" with devaluing theory arguing that when women dominate a field it becomes devalued and wages will drop. In other words... what's the chicken and what's the egg? Do women end up taking lower paying jobs for whatever reason, or do women's jobs BECOME lower paying because women are doing them? \n\nThe research, by my reading, has so far come down on the side of devaluing theory.

There were so many calculations to be made, aspects of space travel to account for, and unknown variables, that it's amazing that ~~scientists~~ teams including Katherine herself managed to successfully get a man into space and even onto the big fuckin space rock that orbits our planet from here on Earth. And to think that if a number was off, the mission could've been fatal. Thanks in part to Katherine Johnson, a \"human computer,\" necessary calculations were made correctly for these many missions in a time where computers weren't as big of a help as they are today.\n\nEdit: see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/9apcim/comment/e4xgqzl?st=JLCN79S6&amp;sh=4bd095cf)",

That would be one parameter you vary, so that you get used to how different gravity impacts the problem.\n\nA good bullshit detector is only a calibrated bullshit detector, and I certainly have less of them than my professors did, because I do less problems by hand.\n\nThat said, my time is better spent working on the software for our Monte Carlo instead of hand cranking calculations, so I don't expect to ever have a good enough bullshit detector to do the problems in my head that my adviser does.",

It certainly gave the Astronauts (who didn't trust this new technology) some confidence, but it changed very little of the actual flight data.\n\n\nAlso, as amazing as it was, the space program wasn't without failures... the US was way behind the USSR in developing the space program because they deliberately stalled their best rocket scientist (Von Braun) because he was an Ex-Nazi (although it's more complicated than that).\nIt took NASA over a dozen explosive experiments to dump the Navy as a leading contractor and let Von Braun's team take the lead.\nWhatever confidence ms. Johonson gave Alan Shepard, he was still well aware that a dozen similar rockets had exploded during takeoff in previous launches... he could've been vaporized almost instantly.\n\n",

The biggest issue they had with early experiments was with the engines. \n\nThe problems started because they hastily converted old V2 Rocket designs (the same rockets the Nazis used to bomb civilians in London unfortunately) to the Redstone, and later Atlas models. It required some adjustments, but they were working against the clock to keep up with the Soviet successes in space.\nAs it happened, until those adjustments were made, several rockets exploded before they could even take off:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13qeX98tAS8\n\nFor every rocket they managed to send to space, a few exploded before they got anywhere. That's why most of NASA's launches are unmanned. Only once they're confident enough it wouldn't explode that they put a living human in it.\n\n\n",

They were paid paid less and people of color were segregated into worse offices on a harder to get to part of NASAs campus. They also received the exact bigotry you'd expect.\n\nIt wasn't *all* bad. There were plenty of people that weren't bigots at NASA and as [this article](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/hidden-figures-nasa-director) says:\n\n&gt;Though African-Americans had to use separate bathrooms and dining rooms when working at Nasa in the first half of the 20th Century, segregation at Langley had mostly been eliminated by the late 1950s. As Nasa was part of the US federal government, it had been working towards de-segregation \u2013 quietly, so as not to attract the attention of the Virginia state government. \u201cBy 1961-62, when the movie happened, most of the physical trappings of segregation would have gone from Langley.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Even though the physical barriers of segregation were removed, the women still faced much discrimination and battled against it for decades.

The British thanked them by splitting there home country of punjab in half and giving it to Pakistan and India e. Essentially leaving them stateless. Both countries would implement genocidal policies against them which are still in place today.",

Good folks, good ideals and brave warriors. \n\nReally glad a piece of history here in Aus marks their contribution in the world wars. \n\nI still recall the folks that rushed out to set up food stalls giving meals to those that suffered natural disasters like bushfires and floods. Again compassion and empathy.",

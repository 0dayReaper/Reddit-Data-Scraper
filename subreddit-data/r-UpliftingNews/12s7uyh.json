            "comment": "Murphy, a bald eagle at a bird sanctuary in Missouri, waited day after day in his modest, yet carefully built nest for his one egg to hatch, but his keepers did not have the heart to break the news to him: The 31-year-old flightless bachelor was sitting on a rock.\n\nThen when an orphaned eaglet needed a dad this month, Murphy was ready to step up.\n\nMurphy soon began responding to the chick\u2019s peeps, and protecting it. And when, as a test, the keepers placed two plates of food in front of the birds \u2014 one containing food cut into pieces that the chick could eat by itself, and another with a whole fish that only Murphy could handle \u2014 the older bird tore up the fish and fed it to the eaglet, said Dawn Griffard, the chief executive of the World Bird Sanctuary in Valley Park. \u201cYou can definitely see the imprinting happening, which is exactly what we wanted,\u201d she said.\n\n[**Read the full story here, even without a subscription to The New York Times**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/us/murphy-bald-eagle-rock.html?unlocked_article_code=qGIkNG_rr7n6YgHYfuqlEJKTzJLej0m1YuS2HKnVNh3b4xboMpjHoajfy8zUSlIt7bYdTLe6ZS0amhsv5NSPuORO9wjW9HCVk_7Kb9cnDA5e7OysTokIeQZgk_2QuptwQEELiD9a2nmasbiob8X7IlE3N04vlv0UaN_fLpDfHxZFCkyHFakweppx1YQeoNV0inLtPRS-Ty2fzhadrbleDgcsUburT3BXLenJ46dRo1zA4fDpMOUrUn-ooS63czSp6yHjBFox1Dm2MyNt2xuMcndrohlZSV8_5rc1Lq1fthCZ98OT5D17DWtwwJHy2UM18cT6OyCIOBm_M7nP&amp;smid=re-nytimes)**.**",

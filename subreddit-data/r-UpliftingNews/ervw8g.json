I was at a theater a year ago and some mid 20-30 year olds snuck into the back of the theater with popcorn, candy, drinks and flung that shit all over the place for about 30 mins. Also made a buncha noise. Eventually my sister went out to let an usher know. Usher walks to the back, stands there for ~5 minutes eyeing them. Of course they were chill til the moment the usher was out of sight then they acted up again. Someone else complained and the usher stuck around much longer. The group eventually left but they tossed their cups on the floor and popcorn was literally *everywhere*.",

The protest was peaceful, with most of the controversy stemming from the fact that participants cleaned up after themselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just cans and you know boxes and trash on the corners and like sidewalks but it looks a lot better,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIt really does.\u201d",

If there is a large percentage of people in your city that have self defense guns, the number of violent robberies tends to be less.  \n\nI have guns locked away from the ammo, because I have small kids that know how to use them.  I trust them to be safe at the range, but i'm not stupid enough to leave them where they can get at them.",

I\u2019m going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.\n\n\nYou cannot control an entire country and its people with drones, tanks, jets, battleships or any of that shit that you so stupidly believe will triumph over citizen ownership of firearms. A drone, jet, tank, battleship or whatever, cannot stand on street corners and enforce \u201cno assembly\u201d edicts. A drone cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband materials or propaganda.\nNone of those things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Drones and those other weapons are for decimating, flattening, glassing large areas, killing many people at once, and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass, they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit.\nDrones are useless for maintaining a police state. Police are needed to maintain a police state. Boots on the ground. No matter how many police or soldiers you have on the ground, they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians. Which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.\n\n\nBut when every random pedestrian could have a Glock jammed in their waistband and every random homeowner has an AR-15, all of that gets thrown out the fucking window because now the police and military are outnumbered and kicking down those doors becomes a lot fucking riskier, lest you catch a bullet on your way in and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.\n\n\nIf you want living examples of this look at every insurgency that the U.S. military has ever tried to destroy. They\u2019re all still kicking with nothing but AK-47s, pick up trucks, and improvised explosives. Because these big scary military monsters you keep alluding to are all but fucking useless for dealing with them.\n\n\nDumb. Fuck.",

The worst case I saw was a dude who went into a very secluded spot *cut down several trees* to make a teepee like structure, then illegally fished a nearby lake. When we caught him he was taking photos of himself in front of his hut. His defense \"The natives lived like this so what does that say about you to callout their lifestyle!?\"\n\nIt did not help his case that 3 of 5 people there were Native American, including myself.",

Few items \n\n1.\tThe notion these were racist or otherwise white supremacist was so outrageous it's basically the laughing stock of jokes in RVA right now. Even the \"militia\" dressed and geared individuals were making fun of themselves calling it alittle like cosplaying.  \n2.\tthere were members from all races as well as females and LGBQ carrying at this event. In all situations members all interacted with each other in complete positivity.  Example BGM (black guns matter) and other white individuals got together, traded info on guns, compared gear, invited each other shooting and to ranges, traded stories etc.  \n3.\twe in RVA universally hate infowars and Alex Jones. So much so that there was an actual threat to his stupid MRAP vehicle here in the area and it was spray painted (attempted).\n4.\tlocal businesses in the area of the rally (downtown Richmond is very small) had a record breaking sales day. Even with the huge lines everyone was kind and super nice to the local businesses. \n5.\tstop calling it a protest, it was a rally. It's held once a year. Every year. Also with the same individuals carrying just as many and type of firearms. Yes this exact thing happened last year. And the year before. And the year before. This simply had much more individuals due to the recent bills being presented (and some passed) regarding gun control. \n6.\tlocally it has been noticed (and not to bring up anything about the trump inauguration) pictures of the event are definitely, without a doubt, skewed smaller. Much more showed up at the rally than many of the sky photos on MSM. Check local sources for pictures such as nbc12.com",

This was an effort to stop these new laws from being signed by the governor.",

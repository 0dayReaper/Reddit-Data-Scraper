The bourgeoisie was never going to save us from the problems it created, but we can still make the changes humanity and the rest of the Earth need for a bright future. It just requires that we come to terms with the depth of that undertaking, detach ourselves from the systems and ideas that got us here in the first place, and embrace rather than cower away from the necessary changes. There's hope for the rainforests, hope for the indigenous peoples, hope for all of us still! We just can't rely on our current \"leaders,\" corporate or government, and their technocratic functionaries to get us there.",

He spoke to bat poachers and asked them why they did it, and the most common answer was \"I need the money to feed myself and my family.\" So he worked with the local governments to turn the bat flights into tourist attractions, with the ex-poachers hired into those projects. Dr. Tuttle calls the philosophy \"Winning friends, not battles.\"\n\nHe also took this approach in the US: anyone who's been to Austin, Texas probably knows about the Bat Bridge. Dr. Tuttle is one of the people responsible for preserving that bat colony and turning it into a tourist spot.\n\nI learned about this from ZeFrank's video promoting the Merlin Tuttle Bat Conservation over at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7z36Hk92Lfc",

And then in 2018 they said they wouldn't recognize anymore because of how unpopular it had become in Rio.\n\nWhat Lula is recognizing are the ones where the ground work was already done but weren't recognized.\n\nThe remaining 8 territories that are being discussed are just far more complicated because they're far more valuable.  Most of these territories have mines that are controlled by private companies and giving these away to indigenous groups would be incredibly disruptive to Brazilian agriculture and industry.  In most countries these kinds of mines stay open and the indigenous groups get the royalties from them instead of the government.  But in this case the indigenous groups negotiating are very dedicated to closing down these mines.",

Also, the Brazilian people have been through multiple military coups, and so the political will around the case is different. \n\nThis is not to make excuses for the US because if there was ever a time to figure it out on the fly, it's now, but more to explain Brazil's resilience.",

And that means American researchers can, for the first time ever, conduct studies using real-world cannabis instead of the terrible low-THC they\u2019ve been forced to use for decades....",

If 0.9% was enough to get relief we wouldn't really need legal \"marijuana\" we could just smoke more. Even the best CBD flower you  can get is really obviously what it is, you can tell by smelling it that it's not gonna get you high if you've been around the stuff enough. Although, I will say, it does kind of make strains like Harlequinn obsolete or at least way less cost-effective than buying an lb of CBD flower for $100 and just mixing it with your regular weed. I make my own oil too.",

It\u2019s surprisingly easy to obtain provided your institution has a DEA license and you maintain good compliance. A colleague does similar research to us. You wouldn\u2019t believe the insane obstacles to gaining small amounts of the research ditch weed grown in Kentucky. When we talk about the drug war, we often think of the casualties, the incarceration rates and the financial burden. There is also a very pressing research cost that doesn\u2019t get talked about much. What the DEA have done over the years is drastically limit how much we know about the biological responses of one of the most used substances in the world, and it\u2019ll take a while yet to make up for this loss. They really have a lot of atoning to do. Hopefully rescheduling, pardoning, and reparations are next.",

From that they make more money from the prison system so it's in their best interest to make sure that there is no quality research because it would largely say that it's harmless (smoking risks notwithstanding) and their rules are based on red scare era nonsense.\n\nWe have a similar problem in the UK. MPs will stand up in the Commons and say weed is a terrible blight, causes crime, mental illness of all kinds, puts good kids on the path to injecting crack and snorting heroin and whatnot, all while they own gigantic farms and export companies which sell enormous amounts of weed everywhere except inside the UK. We're the biggest exporter of the stuff and yet it's a class B drug here, possession of which carries 5 years in jail or an unlimited fine *or both*. Dealing can get you 14 years!",

Not bashing either, it's just the oxygen concentration is much higher throughout, and it's not worth the risk of blowing up a whole facility. \n\nIf you're admitted to the hospital, please talk to your doctors if your pain is being inadequately treated or you don't have an order in for a nicotine patch to help you with withdrawal symptoms. If you don't get a positive response from them, request to speak to the house coordinator. \n\nBeing in a response team to shut off all active oxygen and emergently switching all patients on ventilators to manual tanks is not enjoyable at the least, when 15 seconds or so of non-oxygenated air is enough to send many of them into cardiac arrest.",

The worst though was when I was doing something that I technically should not have been doing whole smoking. The one hitter was clogged but I could not handle trying to clean it and continue the other activity safely, so I torched that sucker as much as I could. Then, all of a sudden, the resin hit that special melting point and it jettisoned a very warm glob of resin onto the very back of my throat. Needless to say gagging initiated and it took all my composure to not throw up. I have not used that clearing technique again as it was pretty close being as bad as picking up a cup you think is your beer and then taking a drink without visual confirmation only to realize it was a cup of dip 'juice'.",

Blew my fucking mind how good it was, and I was happy paying $20/gram. \n\nFast forward 12 years, and I can now drive a few blocks down the road and buy some 25% flower or glass or crystal or diamond or whatever the fuck it's called and consume more THC in a single hit than I ever did smoking an entire ounce of reggie. I can get an ounce of mids for the same price we used to pay for an ounce of mexican brick weed. \n\nHigh school me wouldn't believe it.",

Or, they can sell illegally, but the risk is higher than it was before because there's fewer illegal grow ops, higher chance you'll be the one who gets busted. \n\nThen you add in the cost of inflation and the requirements of grow ops now. People expect a higher quality product, so even illegal ops are switching to hydro and testing their soil. \n\nOn top of that, the shwag and mids are almost always sold off to make oil/edibles. So the cheapest options that helped bring the average cost down are eliminated from the market. Someone coming and buying an 80L garbage bag full of mids is a better customer than you buying 1/2oz for $40. \n\nYou can still get the hookup from someone who either isn't looking for a huge profit per pound or is close to a grower. But the baseline costs of growing weed have skyrocketed, as have customer expectations, and the market has changed overall. Can't expect the same prices you got ten years ago in a new market.",

Most studies don't use flower to test \"cannabis\", with the vast majority (&gt;95%) using isolates or edibles and most are sloppily conducted with questionable methods such as not recording dosage, method of administration, and using questionnaires to gather any \"results\" that can't be physically measured. The latter isn't really their fault since most cannabis effects are subjective and have opposite effects of other people. This is a long way of saying none of the research that's been done up till now can be taken seriously, and it'll take another long while before well-designed studies are actually conducted.",

I don't think any scientific source is going to argue that cannabis is amazing for you, but I think compared to so many of it's contemporaries it's going to be hard to link it with any obvious adverse health affects in any but the heaviest users.\n\nWhat I'm more interested in are any overlooked side effects, like what feels to me like a \"hair of the dog\" problem, where a fun evening with cannabis is followed by a subtle \"bummed out\" feeling the next few days, that can be alleviated by more weed! I think some people prone to anxiety might be self-medicating and not realizing they've given themselves the equivalent of a coffee addiction for something they smoke. Or the second time I had some I had a \"depersonalization episode\", which I'd learned was documented, but not widely discussed. I've gone on to find out one of my friends also had one, and they can be deeply unsettling.\n\nOf course any and all of this is pure speculation, which is why I'm so excited to see what well documented research can uncover.",

Some guy put together these claims over the years and found that cannabis potency increased over 12,000 times over, which is ridiculous.\n\nYes, you can grow and breed strains to be more potent, however you cant selectively breed a strain to go from .01% THC to 30% THC without introducing another strain. Cannabis has always been potent. People in the 60s and 70's used to get Colombian gold and other strains that were grown well and way more potent than anything on the street. It comes down to growing methods and genetics. A well grown plant (lots of light, good environment, good care) will always be more potent than a plant stressed/stunted plant, like the \"reggie\" we see from Mexico.\n\nAt the end of the day though, basing potency only on THC is incomplete. There are other cannabinoids that cause the \"high\" we feel. This explains why certain strains have different effects and why extracted THC has a much different effect than flower. This research hopefully will untangle some of these misconceptions. We have some states trying to limit cannabis by THC content, which is just misguided and unscientific, and genetically problematic.",

We will actually have more reliable data on the impact of weed because there is not as much danger as people say there is. \n\nThe biggest issue is being under influence while doing something you shouldn\u2019t do like driving, which doesn\u2019t make sense to have banned weed for so long. You criminalize the action based on their poor choices at the time. Weed may have been the cause but so is alcohol for drunk driving yet we don\u2019t dare to criminalize alcohol again.",

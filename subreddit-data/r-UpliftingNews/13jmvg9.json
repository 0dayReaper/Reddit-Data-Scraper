There is a big difference between being directly in front of a stripper in real life and looking at one on your PC, even if it is a live stream.  She said the only thing OF did was give some of the strippers a side gig that (if popular enough) could bring in some extra traffic.",

Onlyfans seems to be a pretty saturated market, I think the dream is to have 10k monthly subscribers but the reality is to get to 100",

So a supplier couldn't sell the $25 replacement screen. The New York law was just about breaking that exclusive contracts so suppliers could sell to anyone. The trade group gutted the law by allowing them to sell assemblies not the parts. So now the repair shop needs to buy the $300 assembly not the $25 dollar part. Thus making the repair useless as at that point it's better just to replace the device.",

When equipment breaks down, it usually happens in a field far from anything. The repair has to come to the equipment, not the other way around. If the farmer could just fix it himself, the equipment can be back up and running shortly - minutes or hours. If the farmer can\u2019t, they have to wait for a repairman to come out. During planting and harvest season, the repairmen can\u2019t be everywhere all the time, so you wind up with wait times.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got 2-3 weeks of running around the clock to get crops in or out, \u201cI\u2019ll pencil you in for next Friday, say\u2026between 8 am and 5 pm\u201d just won\u2019t work. They literally can\u2019t afford the downtime.",

I feel like you don't understand how they \"disallow\" it to begin with and confuse it with something else.\n\nIn a nutshell. Repairs require you to connect your equipment to a computer with special software. This is generally true for all motor vehicles in traffic as well.\n\nFarm equipment can be very complicated, especially modern tractors. \n\nThe way John Deere has \"disallowed\" it is by gatekeeping this software. Only their own mechanics are supposed to have access to it. Farmers have got their hands on pirated, cracked versions. But John deere keeps making it more and more difficult. \n\nThing is. This is something pretty much every single car manufacturer does as well. It's not just John Deere. The reason this gets headlines though, Is because farmers are used to being able to repair their own stuff. They don't have the time to take it to an offsite mechanic every time something goes wrong. \n\nHopefully, this can be used to fight other manufacturers that also gatekeep software used to repair products, including phone manufacturers.",

A copy of it should be just as legal as printing a copy of the cupholder as a replacement. Or making a flathead yourself.

This is usually something you read from EU.\n\nAlso, it pisses me off how insincere companies are when they defend their position for this stuff. I.e. \"we want to repair the equipment we made since we have the proper tools and knowhow to prevent additional damages and breach of warranty, which would be bad for the customer\" as if it is somehow in the customer's best interest and that they are helping.\n\nIf this was true, they would offer to repair it for free, not do everything in their power to block customers to repair their own equipment and to force them to pay premium at a \"licensed\" or \"approved\" service. \n\nSuch a bullshit argument if I've ever heard one. This is the shit we've heard from Apple for years and years and one of the reasons I stay far, far away from their products.",

They gave in quickly once it went into law in New York, because they knew it would set a precedent and they'd be better off setting their own repair guidelines than having to follow a court order which could force them to surrender certain software and other products they want to retain control of.\n\nThis allows the consumer to fix Deere products to a certain extent while Deere can still retain involvement in the process. If you install a new part, you're required to enter the part identification number and serial number into the software to allow the machine to continue functioning.\n\nThey'll likely come up with a part specific and expensive software patch with the purchased parts, whereas the courts could have forced them to release the software for the entire machine as a consumer service to owners.",

An example is say you only need to repair a cable that goes to the phone screen, that cable normally would cost $20 from the manufacturer but as they can only sell the full assembly then the repair shop must buy an entire screen assembly totaling $200.",

Sure overclocking your cpu will be a lot of fun, worst that can happen is it burns our before its intended lifespan. But if there\u2019s to be any risk of liability on John Deere\u2019s part, they will insist certain safety standards are met. \n\nIt\u2019s common in europe to regulate modified cars. They have to meet minimum safety and roadworthy standards. (And the EU protect the rights and interests of its citizens over corporate greed, see GDPR, right to be forgotten, labour laws, health and safety standards for industry, there\u2019s no corporate free reign like there is in the US). \n\nThese modified cars also carry a significant insurance price hike (insurance is mandatory to drive on roads at least in my country, criminal offence to drive without). Insurance premiums are often multiples of an unmodified car and sometimes are considered uninsurable by certain insurance companies because  standards of modification are so variable. Plus, at least in my country, the type of driver who drives modified cars is mainly using it for street racing, so not an attractive customer in terms of risk. No reason an average road user needs to do 0-60 in 3.4 seconds. \n\nHow this translates to farming, I\u2019m not sure which modifications they\u2019ve seen but I presume they\u2019ve seen unsafe mods, possibly to increase driving speed, increase load bearing potential, speed up a specialised process for work efficiency, waterproofing of vented machinery, or addition of untested or improvised parts for an unforeseen task that the machine was never designed to do. For more reading see /r/RedneckEngineering it will give you a flavour of what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nBottom line it all sounds par for the course that farmers can repair and replace parts themselves to a specified safety standard without voiding warranty and without JD taking a huge incalculable litigation risk from potentially dangerous modifications",

I am all for reparability and I often choose some products over others due to their ability to be repaired.\n\nHowever in the case of the iPhone replacing the hardware required for biometric auth and blocking the repair by unauthorized repair shops is primarily a security feature that just so happens to have the side effect of limiting repairs. If just anyone could replace the fingerprint or face scan hardware with no other safeguards they could be replaced with parts that allow for bypassing those authorization methods. I am not fond of that but at least there is a reason for it other than \"we can charge more for repairs\".",

It doesn't historically work out well for working folks who end up being murdered by private armies for striking to get things like free time, non-life threatening conditions and just compensation. Many of them end up in company housing where their pay is returned to the aforementioned individuals through \"company stores\" which are the only source of basic necessities. Entire industries, indeed \"competing\" ones,  can be owned by one individual in some cases and government, too weak and feeble to do anything, is puppeted openly by unelected, profit driven overlords who decide national and geopolitical policy based on personal interest and gain. \n\nWe've done that, it doesn't work out well. It's more.of a Eutopian pipe dream than communism. It actually led to the idea of communism, that's where it comes from. \n\nPower, especially economic power, always consolidates, always corrupts and always abuses. It's not a matter of eliminating it , it's a matter of choosing where it goes and how much it can do. There is no ideal, it's going to happen in any system, so pick your poison and don't pick the one where there's zero recourse against it.",

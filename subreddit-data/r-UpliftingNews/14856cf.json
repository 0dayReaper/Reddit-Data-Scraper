So, it's a lot, lot better than it used to be.\"\n\nHere's to the people braver than I to not be afraid of hate, bigotry, and bullying to give others courage to be who they are and here's to people who are brave enough to love and accept them.",

Though, I didn't keep count in the amount of people who did march in the parade in my city. I'll ask some of my friends who did participate if there's an official count of those who were in the parade (not just watching). But including spectators we reached in the thousands for sure. I am stoked to see it beat last year's record for Alabama and I hope next year bears this year's!",

While Louisiana is much better known for it (as New Orleans has the far larger celebration), Mobile was actually the first city in the country to celebrate Mardi Gras.\n\nMany of the oldest krewes in New Orleans were actually founded by people *from* Mobile, and a local folk hero in the city is Joe Cain, an infamous reveler who brought the holiday back after the Civil War ended.\n\nI highly recommend checking it out some time. It's a bit more family friendly than the NO parades (though the after parties and balls are just as wild), and the city is really unique to visit, as it has a huge blend of architecture from different periods of the country.",

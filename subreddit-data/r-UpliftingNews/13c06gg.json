Who would you even turn to? Would you wish to bother some police officer with some far-fetched suspicion that traffickers might be around? And even if there were, who's gonna tell you that these people won't come for you too if you talk? Complacency, cluelessness, cowardice, and simply having too much going on in your own life to care. \n\nThose are the problems. Being a hero and bringing such things to the attention of the authorities is always a bit of a risk. And especially for people with families, that risk is rarely seen as worth it.",

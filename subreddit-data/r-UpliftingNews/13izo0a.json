Does this mean those emissions should be counted to other countries such as China, who imported a lot of machinery and equipment between the 1945 and 1970 from the US and EU? No, because every country is responsible for their own emissions. \n\nAs seen in this [graph](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7145ebcb-bbe2-430a-9f22-74f3c828925c_3400x2400.png), the US outsourced approximately 7% of their emissions to the rest of the world, China included. Also seen in the graph, shows that the intersection of outsourcing emissions only occured from the 2000s onwards and is just a fraction. \n\n While China emits 200% more as the US and 300% more as the EU.\n\nAdditionally\n\n&gt; [In China, roughly 87 percent of the steel and 99 percent of the cement produced is consumed domestically. The vast bulk of the country\u2019s climate pollution isn\u2019t being driven by foreigners; it\u2019s being driven by domestic growth.](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/4/18/15331040/emissions-outsourcing-carbon-leakage)",

The US and EU don't pollute as much as I think? 7% is such a tiny number. Most of China's pollution is driven by domestic growth and not foreign markets? Ok, then, I'm wrong, so what does that change?   \n\nIt's very clear that the EU and US lifestyle has an expiration date. It doesn't matter how much they claim to reduce emissions while posting economic growth. We are post economic growth. We are literally being cooked alive.",

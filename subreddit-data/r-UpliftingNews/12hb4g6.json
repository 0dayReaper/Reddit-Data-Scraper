I know that they were removed in the City of London because of the Bishopsgate bombing (not actually involving any bins) and they only put a few back years later so trying to find a bin in the square mile is a bit of a pain in the arse.\n\nThose bins that you saw are common, especially in railway stations and moreso after the 7/7 bombings. Some bins were put back after botht he IRA and 7/7, but after that, it became just the bag with maybe a lid to signify standard waste or recycling. \n\nThe people that told you are correct, you could easily spot anything untoward in them, some bombs had anti-tamper devices which would be harder to spot and solve in solid bin and a solid bin would become shrapnel unless if they used bomb-resistant bins.",

                    "comment": "Here is a brief simplified version of a history which is very long and complex. I have only included the main points but it's still quite long, sorry about that:\n\nIn the 17th century (and in other periods), the British government invaded and colonised Ireland with loyal British colonists. Under British rule, British colonists comprised the elite ruling class in Ireland, with Irish natives stripped of rights, property and often starved or slaughtered en masse. Many native Irish rebellions against British rule occur, in which British colonists are often killed. Each community fears the other. In particular the British colonists have an existential fear of losing the colonial society they have built. \n\nThe two cultures are quite different. The Irish natives and the British settlers do not share the same religion and they don't even share the same language until the Irish language is largely eliminated by British policy.\n\nIn the 20th century a volunteer army is formed to fight for Irish independence. It is called the Irish Republican Army - the IRA. In the 1920s the IRA forces the British Army to retreat out of most of Ireland, which becomes mostly independent by treaty between Ireland and Britain. \n\nThe British continue to occupy only 6 counties in the North of Ireland. Colonisation had been most intense in the North, so there are many people there descended from British colonists who are still loyal to Britain. The descendants of colonists are almost all Protestants because their ancestors are from Protestant Britain. The descendants of Irish natives are mostly Catholics because Ireland never had a protestant reformation. Obviously, because of occasional inter-marriage, a person could be descended from both natives and colonists. A person's religion generally decided their status.\n\nUnder the British administration of the North of Ireland the Irish Catholics are second class citizens. Local government is entirely dominated by loyal protestants. Catholics are not allowed equal access to housing or employment and their votes are worth less than protestant votes. They have virtually no political representation and are often under attack by the police. The IRA still exists clandestinely in the North but is much weaker after the fighting in the 1920s. The IRA sometimes intervenes to defend Catholics against pogroms but is mostly inactive for decades.\n\nConditions under British rule in the North are in many ways similar to segregation in the American south. Inspired by the American Civil Rights movement, the Irish organise a civil rights movement in the North. Their peaceful protests are often violently attacked by the British police and military. Infamously one peaceful protest was fired on by the British Army which shot 26 people and killed 14. \n\nThe protestant public are told by their leaders that Catholics are their enemies, and that the civil rights movement is a criminal attempt to ruin their way of life. This is easy to believe because the two communities are quite separated. Schools, for example, are segregated. \n\nExtremist anti-Catholic protestants organise paramilitary groups to attack Catholics and drive them out of the British-occupied North. They call themselves Loyalists. Similar in ways to the KKK in America, but more militarised. Huge numbers of Catholics are bombed and burned out of their homes and thousands flee to the independent south where the Irish government establishes refugee camps. \n\nAfter internal disagreements over strategy, the IRA decides to rapidly re-arm, expand recruitment, and intervene to defend Catholics. It is also decided that British rule in the North of Ireland must finally end, and this can only be achieved by defeating the occupying British army. The IRA emphasises that their goal is equality for all groups in Ireland, but that violence and killing is necessary to achieve this goal.\n\nThe conflict lasts for roughly 30 years. It consists mostly of fighting between the IRA and British-aligned forces. British aligned forces consist of the British army and police, as well as Loyalist paramilitaries, which are technically illegal but are not-so-secretly armed, supplied with intel, and assisted in other ways by the British state. Many civilians are killed. Loyalist paramilitaries in particular kill many civilians, as they mostly attack Catholic civilians rather than the IRA. IRA attacks against \"economic targets\" - banks, businesses etc. - also result in civilian casualties despite attempts to warn civilians away from targets before an attack.  \n\nAfter decades of fighting the IRA accept that they can't fully defeat one of the most powerful military forces on earth. The IRA in comparison is a tiny guerilla force of mostly unpaid and poorly equipped volunteers. However, the British military also accept that they cannot fully defeat the IRA. A stalemate exists.\n\nA peace treaty is agreed by representatives of both sides in 1998. The terms are that everyone in the North will have civil rights and an equal say. The British police force in the North is disbanded and replaced with a less anti-Catholic force. The North stays under British jurisdiction but it is promised that at some future date a referendum will be held and a majority may vote to end British rule if they choose. The fighting almost entirely ends. Most British troops withdraw. The IRA disarm and cease operations. \n\nThe IRA's political organisation, Sinn F\u00e9in, had been censored and banned under British law but after the peace deal they are allowed to operate normally. They are now the most popular party in the North of Ireland and in the independent Irish state. They lead the North's regional government alongside the other political parties from the region. (Although the local government of the North is currently not operating properly due to Brexit-related disagreement)\n\nThat's the basic history behind the war known as 'The Troubles' 1969-1998.",

Had unusual cold sweats last night, yesterday and today I had a weird breathing feeling that follows \u201cshortness of breath\u201d descriptions but not very severe at all, and my throat has itched for a few days until it stopped this afternoon. I could easily just be a hypochondriac, but my idiot college roommates went out and partied at crowded bars on last Thursday and Saturday nights in my college town that has cases and I\u2019d like to rule out the possibility that I am sick. Maybe looking way to far into it, but it\u2019s also explain why my runs for the last 5 days (before yesterday) were getting slower despite putting in the same or more effort. \n\n\nWe\u2019ve already established a number of people are asymptomatic. I\u2019m hoping they ramp up test availability for people.",

They need all the help they can get right now and offered me a full time position starting at $13.50 an hour (which is almost twice the minimum wage in my state). They also offer health insurance, dental, vision, paid time off, vacation days, basically more than I\u2019ve ever gotten anywhere else. They also are offering 2 weeks off, paid, if you think you\u2019re infected and don\u2019t want to come in. \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to finally working for a company that doesn\u2019t treat people like shit.",

May I ask how many days off you get? And do you have extra sick days? Working full time, minimum vacation days in Germany are 24, most have 27-30 days. When you\u2019re sick (with doctors notice of course) you get up to 6 weeks full pay, after that health insurance will keep paying 60%.",

We only Monday got any info on the ongoing issue. Every single employee is getting a 2 dollar raise during these hard times  until at least the end of April. All employees are allowed any sick time they need, without it effecting their job status, and anyone who contracts the virus is due their usual pay plus two addition weeks pay. No one is being over worked, and no one is being punished for calling out.\n\nWhole Foods is a company that has given me so much, I've been trained to be an effective leader, I have learned so many skills and things I'll take with me everyone I go in life. I have amazing insurance and amazing pay that afforded me to start a family. Whole foods is an easy company to pick on, but I'll tell you what I'd rather work here than any other grocery store in the US, and in the small town I live in there is no other options that pay and treat their employees with as much respect as they do here.\n\nObviously every store is different, I've worked at some locations with bad leadership, but stories like this always just feel so exaggerated. There are so many levels of leadership and ways to go around a situation like this. If your management is truly acting the way listed here in the comments, you should have approached your store team leaders, or HR group, or any of the many anonymous lines the company offers for mistreatment like this.",

My wife had an accident in work that wasn't her fault two weeks ago.\n She broke her foot so she is on full wages for the next 5 weeks. Her job is safe because she works in food retail and it's an essential business. Still glad she out now because Ireland is in high risk mode.\n Thanks assholes that went to the races at Cheltenham in England and the Italian's that came to Ireland because they had flights paid for a match that was cancelled anyway.\n I'm a goldsmith. That's about as non essential as you can get right now, so I'm out of work. My boss has stepped up. He will pay me what the social welfare would give me if I was actually unemployed and can claim that back off the government till we get some semblance of normality back and start working again. It's not a lot but, it will cover the mortgage and we have her wages to cover everything else.\n Our banks are stepping up too. I can get a 3 month mortgage deferral without penalties if I need it and can pay just the interest after that if things are still down the toilet.\n I really feel for you guys in the US. From what I can see, you have everything stacked against you at the best of times and don't have a social welfare system to help that seems to care about the average Joe. \n Stay safe guys and do your best to take care of each other.\n\nEDIT: Did format for easier reading but my phone ignored it.

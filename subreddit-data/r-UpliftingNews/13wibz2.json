Unfortunately I know someone who had cycles of both of these drugs and they didn't really work but now they are stuck with permanent side effects like neuropathy. There is a difference between immunotherapy and chemotherapy and radiation. More informed doctors can help their patients with reliable treatments based on these methods in the article. I hope it works for most people.",

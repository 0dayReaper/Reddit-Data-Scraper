People are going to eat meat regardless, but if we can get that meat efficiently from fish, the world will objectively be a better place.\n\nSustainable fish farms would reduce the need to overfish oceans, emit less greenhouse gass than ranches and factory farms producing beef and chicken, and reduce cruelty toward more 'complex' animals.",

They appear to be perfectly healthy and the article mentions that they're testing now to ensure that factors like frost resistance won't be an issue down the line. \n\nThe modification makes them better for eating, but not necessarily worse at being fish. Humans need some source of protein and it could be argued that highly-efficient fish farms could actually reduce the demand for the exploitation of more complex animals like cows and chickens.",

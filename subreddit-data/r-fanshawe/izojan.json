    "postText": "Hello!  \nI saw a few students asking what to expect when they return to campus. Although I teach virtually this term, I have been provided with information that should help you out:  \n\n\n* EVERYONE must complete the COVID Health &amp; Safety Awareness: A Guide to Returning to Campus - FALL 2020 version - BEFORE coming onto campus\n* In Fanshawe Learns, type COVID in the search box\n* It's recommended you download the Fanshawe Stay Safe app so you can do the COVID self-assessment test on the fly if you forget\n* Masks are mandatory on campus, except when you are alone in an enclosed space\n* A mask can be 'scarves, cloth/bandanas, so long as the cover your chin, mouth and nose and do not have an exhale vent'\n* Students who can't wear need to obtain an accommodation letter\n* Rooms are being cleaned by staff and students alike - sanitizer and disinfectant wipes are available\n* Barriers have been installed\n* Some rooms are available as homework/computer labs \n\nIf you have questions, please feel free to ask me...or your professors, of course. I don't check here all that often, but I'll try!\n\nTake care and have a great year! :)",

Most study areas inside the college are closed but there are some lounge areas available with some seats blocked off for distancing.\n\nThe library is completely closed to students so no group study rooms or tables to use there.\n\nUsing the spaces is free but there is a charge for printing.",

    "postText": "The College will not tolerate gender-based and sexual violence. We support those who experience gender-based or sexual violence, and we work diligently in all Fanshawe environments and with community partners on programs, policies and resources to reduce the experience of gender-based and sexual violence at Fanshawe. \n\nRecently, the College has learned of sexually violent and threatening posts that initiated on the social media platform Discord and spread to other online environments. Fanshawe College leadership is working with Campus Security Services and the London Police Service to identify the individuals responsible. The posts and users have been removed.\u00a0 \n\nWe encourage students to remain diligent and alert in social settings to keep you and your friends safe online and in person. In addition, the College will also be providing additional security at the Out Back Shack and Oasis. \n\nWe urge you to help us make Fanshawe a safe and positive space where members of the College community feel able to work, learn and express themselves. Leah Marshall, Fanshawe\u2019s Sexual Violence Prevention Advisor, will be holding a drop-in support session tomorrow, Thursday, September 16 from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the Merlin Residence Atrium. Or, to book a confidential support session, please contact Leah at [lkmarshall@fanshawec.ca](mailto:lkmarshall@fanshawec.ca).

I paid thousands of dollars, and I expect the teachers to teach.\n\nWhats the point of having class when you'll just have us read a textbook? Anyone can do that. Whats the point of having an online portion when the pdfs are outdated, or the videos don't work?",

One of the classes the teacher just reads off the slides so I learn basically nothing, the other class has literally all the course content online, so I really only need to go to 2 classes if I wanted too. I learn better by myself online, but I can see how it doesn't work for everyone.\n\nOne of my professors just rushes through the lectures and class is usually finished after an hour or less. I'm basically paying $$800 to live on residence just to have most of my classes online smh.",

But they are actually supposed to engage students with the content.\n\nWhy not reach out to your teacher, coordinator and cc the program manager for your program? Don\u2019t just complain, but write an email outlining your concerns about the course.\n\nIf the course isn\u2019t working for you, the only way they know is when someone takes the time to report it. Say something to them, recommend what might work better to help you learn the content. At the very least someone will check the FOL links.\n\nIf they can\u2019t implement any changes for this term, you will at least have helped future students. Or - maybe they won\u2019t hire the teacher again based on what they find...",

            "comment": "I could write a book on Fanshawe college about all the areas they fall short.\n\n\nUnqualified teaching staff, insubordinate staff refusing to accommodate students with disabilities, incompetent administration both in the program offices and in the registrar's office, out of date programming, programming full of errors and mistakes, staff who can't deliver (teach) their classes because they've never had any experience with the material. I could go on but you get the point.\n\n\n\nI was proactive by reporting any issues affecting my program to the 'professors' directly, then coordinators, school dean's, management, the FSU, and to the ombuds office. I also made sure to fully answer student feedback surveys with detailed responses in the space provided. Hours of my time were invested in my attempts to make a difference for myself and other students who were struggling to voice their grievances as well. Nothing was changed and it's been a number of years since I was in a program and after talking to others I know there, nothing has been done to change and improve the broken school.\n\n\n\nInternational students are worth their weight in gold to the college. It's too bad the college fails to accommodate them and their cultures. Fanshawe fails to help many of them adjust to how things are done here and the students get reprimanded for mistakes the students didn't even know they were making.\n\n\n\nDoes it surprise anyone that programs with over 500 students enrolled only have a tiny fraction of those classes graduate?\n\n\n\nMy take away is this. Fanshawe College is a business and they will only do whatever is good for business. As long as there are students giving them money then there's nothing wrong on their end. If you're a student with problems and are getting 'help' from the counseling office, they too don't have a voice. Anytime I knew of someone who had a counselor attempt to work with the student's program office they were either ignored, or the office only did enough to quiet the counselor.\n\n\n\n\nWith some small changes, more students would be successful in their programs but clearly that's not something on the college's agenda. They run a business and they have great marketing campaigns so everything looks high and mighty at Fanshawe while all the dirt is swept under the rug. I would have liked to see other capable students from my program graduate with me but they couldn't fight past the barriers the college failed to remove from their path. Some of those students did finish at other colleges and they are now successful because of the choice to avoid Fanshawe.\n\n\n\nI personally fought the urge to drop out weekly and I persevered to complete my degree at the top of my program (Dean's Honour Roll). I would have dropped if I wasn't successful with all the appeals I submitted to get the grades I deserved. The shameful part of all that was the teaching staff who fought me on many of the issues I brought to their attention. If they had any decency, they would have been receptive to the reality that they were wrong but they're too arrogant to admit fault and would rather have their office deal with the appeal processes. For now, I'll be telling anyone asking about my college history about how flawed it was and to do anything to get onto a career path without going to college. There are lots of online options now and on the job training for many careers. Take advantage of apprenticeships, or working a shitty position to get a foot in the door. Some of the best in my industry are self-taught and they're very successful. Do whatever it takes to motivate yourself to do more.",

            "comment": "I would say I have that kind of experience with my gen ed courses but graphic design, it's not too bad, teachers will teach on screen on what to do on programs such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreameaver, etc. Most courses in graphic design were mandatory to show up for lessons to help complete the project since not all the graphic design profs will do screencasts and upload videos to FOL.\n\nI can sorta understand how you feel, my gen ed was mythology folktale and video game theory at Fanshawe, it was just show up and listen to the powerpoint slides then do homework on your own time. Either way, I learned it was better to show up even if the class was useless because you may miss out on things they said in class if you were absent that day.",

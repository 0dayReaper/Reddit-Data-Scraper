            "comment": "I'm not familiar with the program itself but I did study at Fanshawe for 3 years before the pandemic. \n\nI suggest going to their open house to explore their campus and talk to the students in the program to help get a better idea what to expect. \n\nOverall, my experience with Fanshawe isn't awful, lived at their traditional residence for 3 years and I always felt safe. The main campus has a lot of food options but places like Oasis is expensive but I think it's decent, I had some go-to eateries there. Outback Shack is their restaurant bar, I think the food there isn't too bad either. I fell in love with their fish tacos that I even just dined at the Outback Shack alone, lol \n\nI think London a decent city but would I move there? Probably not. Although there's bad drivers in any city but I feel like it takes awhile to get to one side of the city, especially since its just city roads so traffic is everywhere. I think bus transportation wasn't too bad, a lot of buses will stop directly into Fanshawe so you can catch like most the buses alongside the road of Oxford and some stops from Downtown. I think most city buses also stop near Fanshawe's downtown campuses too. I think Downtown is more inviting in London too, compared to where I currently live, KW region. I barely head to downtown Kitchener because there's just little to see but in London, you can walk around and check out the tall buildings or explore some restaurants there. I've done this a few times if I just wanted to get out of my residence and you can take some nice photos in Downtown London.",

I have applied to some other colleges as well and Fanshawe was never my priority but the offer came up so quick like just in a week I couldn't really make a decision. I am an international student and my agent says that the college is fine but the reviews which I found from the past or current students were really different. Maybe I'll just wait for the other colleges then.",

London is an okay city, some areas can get kind of sketchy, public transit here isn't the best for reliability.\n\nUnfortunately, I have recently decided to leave Fanshawe because it is the worst educational experience I have had. I found my program faculty to be condescending, unclear, and unsupportive of me and my fellow students. Lectures and courses are disorganized, and students are not supported adequately. I will say, I came to Fanshawe after graduating from university (Western/UWO) so maybe my expectations are different, but Fanshawe has been a complete disappointment in my experience and not worth throwing tuition away for. I actually had a faculty member at Fanshawe openly criticize and berate me for having gone to university in front of an entire class.",

Fanshawe's admission process has been the most insufferable, tedious long winded application I've every submitted for arguably, the most craptasticly dreadful organization. I've never been treated like an inferior half wit in my life until I applied to Fanshawe. The officious douchebag in admissions received transcripts for two degree programmes I graduated from, and still had the audacity to insist I prove I graduated from high school. Pathetic. And to think in the late 80's and 90's, Ryerson, which is now Toronto Metropolitan University, was called Rye High and almost on par with this mess.",

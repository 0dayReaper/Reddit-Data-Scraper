They treat the professors - especially the newer ones - horribly, but there's also some profs who just really are not good at teaching, and that's where the focus should be. Industry qualifications are great, but it doesn't matter how good you are at what you do if you cannot communicate that as a prof to students who clearly will/do not have the same level of experience.\n\nTwofold issue, IMO. Just hoping I can leverage this into a job, at any rate.",

There is a job board at Fanshawe but it\u2019s kind of useless since the staff in charge of finding companies to list positions and take in students are relatively bad at their job.\n\nEdit: For anything that can be completely taught online, you are probably better off buying a 20$ course on Udemy to learn the basics. A lot of Fanshawe material are the bare basics and don\u2019t require a real person to teach. \n\nThat being said some employers will not take that kind of certificate as real education and you still have to go get a diploma or degree. Just depends where you want to work and what you want to do!",

            "comment": "I went to Fanshwe from 2018 to just last year. I wasted years and thousands of dollars going to their CTN/CTY program and I struggled with it every step of the way. If you had any issues at all, be it with the content, the way profs were teaching said content, the profs themselves or the students, you were on your own. Any attempt to get help is met with contempt, disappointment and disregard. Technical problems? Good luck getting the profs to even look at anything and the I.T. department was more useless than tits on a bull. Have issues with a prof? Suck it up and deal with it. Even when you have solid evidence of malpractice the college will just look the other way. The most important thing I learned at Fanshawe is that Fanshawe isn't a school, it's a business and doesn't give a rats ass about providing an actual education. There's a reason a lot of places now will just laugh at you if you say you got Fanshawe creds. It's because it all means nothing. Reasons why I left was that the college was actively screwing over students, pinning blame on us for shit that was the fault of the ones managing the program and who decided they didn't need to hire people with working knowledge of what they were teaching anymore. In the SQL Database course they I was in before they merged it with another they \"couldn't find a professor who was proficient with SQL\" or so they claim and just decided to bring some schmuck in to teach it. None of us who relied on the prof to actually teach us got very far. One-page handouts of a PDF text book and the expectation that we knew EXACTLY what to do to complete the labs were all we got and by the time we had reached the mid-terms, half the class had already left. We lost even more afterwards and many who remained began to question whether or not this guy knew what he was doing because at the time, Fanshawe hadn't disclosed the fact that the prof teaching us didn't know SQL. By the time the second exams were rolling around the corner we started harassing our program heads about it and they only finally told us the truth around Christmas just after our term had ended and when we started asking for a refund or a retake of the course we were just told we had to deal with the marks we got and those who failed i.e. practically everyone who stuck around were told we were going to have to retake it and pay for it too. We got robbed and screwed out of our education and come the end of the Winter 2021 term I had enough. I'm going to triOS now with what little money I got left and I'm doing significantly better. Whilst I struggled through Fanshawe's program, I've been excelling in triOS'. Content that I had a difficult time understanding has been made much clearer and my marks have improved greatly. All I can say at this point is fuck Fanshawe and good riddance. Sorry for the wall of text but I hope at the very least it helps someone make a good decision and get the fuck out and go somewhere else.",

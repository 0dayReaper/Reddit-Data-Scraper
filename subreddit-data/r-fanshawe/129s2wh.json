    "postText": "Hi y'all, I'm currently looking at the program mentioned above, but I have no idea if it'd be worth applying. I would be applying for Sept. 2024, and I would be a recent university graduate. I read that the program is highly competitive and wanted to hear about what it's like? I wouldn't want to apply if it wouldn't be worth it for me, or apply to a different school. What exactly are they looking for?",

The field in general is highly competetive, and I would reccomend applying to multiple MRT programs if you are serious about the job. I've heard the program only sets you up to take x-rays, and it may be hard to switch paths if you don't like it.\n\nAs for what they're looking for, I wish I knew. I have a 4.0 university cGPA and got into another MRT program with a 5% acceptance rate, but not Fanshawe (around 14%).",

    "postText": "1. When will offers for competitive programs such as nursing, dental, MRT, RT be sent out? March 1, 2023? \n\n2. Does this mean second semester grades of pre-health are not taken into calculation for admission? \n\n3. I assume there will be a condition GPA offer of 3.0 - 70%+?\n\n4. Anyone who got accepted in the mentioned program in the previous years, mind stating their GPA/grades. Just so we can have an idea of what GPA/grades were accepted. \n\nThanks",

            "comment": "I took Pre-health last year, and from what I understand if you receive a conditional offer you will have to meet the admission requirements of the program/maintain a certain GPA.  \nFor example, if admission requirements for RT include a minimum grade of 70% in each required course, you have to maintain that mark in those classes to keep your offer, plus maintain a specific GPA.  \nLast year when I received offers for nursing and RT I emailed admissions to confirm the GPA that I had to maintain to keep my offer (I can't remember what it was specifically, but do remember that it didn't have to be as high as the GPA to get accepted).  \nI'd recommend contacting admissions for clarity once you do receive offers if it is not specified in your offer letter.",

In my hygiene program I don't think anyone had below a 3.8, not sure though. There were also people with university degrees as well, about half.",

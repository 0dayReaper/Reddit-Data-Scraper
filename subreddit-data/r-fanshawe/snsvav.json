    "postText": "Where do I begin? Well, this program is obviously supposed to teach you everything they put on the college page. They roughly accomplish these but not exactly. Most of the testing you'll experience in this program seems to be about the tiniest stuff that instructors expect you to know every single thing from the week before the next class. I'm sorry, but I will never be an expert after one 2h lecture and writing notes about it and a lab. This program has extremely high expectations for all of its students and it's hard. Especially with the winter intake, your program is even more shortened and crammed more information into it they expect you to know word for word.\n\nIf you seriously want to take this program and do above average, expect to dedicate more time to a school than you have for any job or schooling before. I know there are many pros to this program but this is a huge problem it has and most students alongside me can agree it's mentally deteriorating and especially when the dropout rate after the second semester is EXTREMELY HIGH due to a lack of motivation and success. \n\nThis program needs to seriously be re-looked at for people who are entirely new to all this information. Because as a beginner in most of these sectors I don't feel comfortable at all with anything I've really learned and they rely hugely on past semesters to teach you properly and some don't.\n\nConsider this a caution to anyone entering this program or considering it. As a current student who previously enjoyed the exploration of cyber security this program has single-handedly ruined it almost and made me want to consider switching careers and programs SEVERAL times.",

            "comment": "It had been so long since someone complained about CYB, I thought students might have actually started to figure it out.  \nIt's hard cause you are learning something. I am done now but I still know people in the program. There are peer tutors for the program for a reason, but for whatever reason you decide to not bother using them?  \nCyber Security Entry level positions are mid career IT positions. It is hard because you as someone with no experience are being taught the basics to try and compensate. Most people in cyber security have three to five years of another related field, app development, networking, patching, something.   \nThere are literally tons of warnings saying that you should expect to put forty hours a week in and sixty if you have tests.   \nThis is something most people have trouble with is the learning curve, its steep no argument.   \nI will say that I agree but there is nothing they can do, you can't take material out, its not possible. You spend all of like two weeks on OSPF and NAT. This is a community college, they cant put electives as mandatory requirements because not every high school has them, additionally they are there as highly recommended.   \nSecurity professionals are not necessarily masters of all but they are knowledgeable of all because you will be in a profession where you will be a consultant for IT Operations and asked questions daily about compliance, policies and etc.  \n\n\nSo, no I am not trying to make you think you are crazy or stupid. You are exactly where everyone else is when they were at this point in the program. It is hard, there is no other way about it.   \nWhen you get to your first co-op next winter you will quickly learn that what you have learned will matter.\n\nA couple tidbits of knowledge to anyone lurking;   \n1. you will never stop school really, technologies advances so rapidly that you will always be reading about the newest threats, trends and tech everyday.  \n2. when you get to co-op, do not dismiss help desk or networking jobs. They are a fantastic place to get experience and build confidence in what you learned.  \n3. you have come to fanshawe for the endorsement of the college that you are capable of demonstrating a broad spectrum of knowledge, applying it is just as important.  \n4. Finally to those of you in second semester seeing this, Network Components is no joke, study hard.\n\nI recommend to anyone to check out r/cybersecurity See what the industry is looking like.",

It is all recycled material and posts that half the time don't even line up with our semester. They will release assignments and test dates and they still say  fall 2021.\n\nI have professors that put literally zero effort in to actually teaching anything. They make a zoom meeting that they refuse to record, say hi, release an assignment and then check out. One professor releases \"lecture\" videos that are less then 2 minutes long. \n\nI put in 50 hours or more a week and I still feel like I am barely staying afloat, which I recognize is no ones problem but my own. However, it would be nice if when we had a quiz or test... the professor knew whether it was multiple choice, short answer or what. \n\nFanshawe itself has been an uphill battle since the beginning. If and when you get a response to a phone call or email, your questions or concerns are rarely answered. It is incredibly hard to feel like anyone cares. You just get the \"well cause covid,\" argument, as if covid forces you to put less effort into your job.\n\nI know it is community College but I expected more support and professionalism.",

            "comment": "I'll share my thoughts as a Fanshawe Graduate. \n\nIt's always surprising to me the lack of effort that students expect to put forward. 40 hours a week is the minimum. Yet a lot of students seem to struggle with this. When you graduate and work in cybersecurity, you may have 60-70 hour weeks when things go wrong (SolarWinds, Log4Shell, etc). You might as well get used to the workload now. Then again, you will often work a regular work week, but you need to be prepared to flex.\n\nAnother thing to look at is what your professors are being paid. \n\nFirst, let's take a look at the full-time professors. Fanshawe just posted for a CYB professor on LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/professor-cybersecurity-at-fanshawe-college-2912771237/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/professor-cybersecurity-at-fanshawe-college-2912771237/)\n\n* Master's required (Ph.D. preferred)\n* 5+ years experience (professional certifications preferred)\n* 44 hours a week\n* Salary scale: 66K - 115K\n\nNow, let's take a look at a cybersecurity job board ([https://cybersn.com/public/search-jobs](https://cybersn.com/public/search-jobs)). Note that most of those positions pay more than the top level professor salary. \n\n\"But, Abject Falcon, those are not Canadian positions!\"\n\nTalk to people who have graduated from your program. The odds are that several of them, with just their college education, have graduated into jobs that start above Fanshawe's base professor salary. \n\nIt gets even worse when you start to talk about part time faculty. According to glassdoor ([https://www.glassdoor.ca/Hourly-Pay/Fanshawe-College-Part-time-Professor-Hourly-Pay-E477767\\_DAO.htm?filter.jobTitleExact=Part-time%20Professor](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Hourly-Pay/Fanshawe-College-Part-time-Professor-Hourly-Pay-E477767_DAO.htm?filter.jobTitleExact=Part-time%20Professor)) part time professors make between $83 and $92 per hour. Let's go with the top salary range. Now let's talk about a course that is 4 credit hours per week. Part time faculty are only paid for their \"teaching hours\", which means that they make $368 hours to teach that class. As was mentioned in this thread, a lot of professors record their lectures and have lab time. So assume two hours is allocated to creating the lecture and two hours is allocated to the lab time. There's the 4 hours gone. Is that where it ends? Let's assume you want your professor to look at your lab or test and provide feedback. What is a reasonable amount of time per student? 15 minutes? That's not a lot of time, so you will probably get rushed feedback, but let's go with that. With an average for 40 students in your section, that is 10 hours of grading. Every week, at least a couple of your classmates request a one-on-one with the professor. Let's be optimistic and assume it is only two students at 30 minutes each, that's another hour. We're suddenly up to 15 hours per week. What about email? Professors are supposed to respond daily during the week and depending on the volume it is probably 15-30 minutes daily. Let's call it 20 minutes daily, that's 100 minutes or 1.6 hours. Now, you're looking at 16.6 hours minimum. That is $22.16/hour. Let's now assume worst case scenario - 30 minutes per student for feedback, 4 students per week, and 30 minutes daily for email would be 28.5 hours per week. Your part time professor is now making $12.91/hour (less than minimum wage). None of this includes time for setting up tests, entering accommodations for a dozen students, exam grading (part time professors aren't paid for exam week but still need to grade your exams), or any other things that may come up. \n\nPart time professors are typically industry professionals who make decent money and are looking for a side gig. A side gig should be financially beneficial. Looking at those numbers, even $22.16/hour is hard to call financially beneficial when you have a full time job. This means you need to find someone who is a) passionate about teaching new minds or b) willing to do the bare minimum and won't feel bad. There are always people in column b, but those in column a are few and far between. When they do come along they end up having to endure abuse from students - students who yell and scream at them, students who cheat and then harass the professor because they were caught, students who just don't care, students who file complaints because they aren't smart enough to understand the material. They then have to balance handling those students with giving enough attention to the students who do want to learn and who do make an effort. All for basically no financial gain and no real recognition or accolades. It is a thankless job that quickly breaks down and destroys those people who were once in column a. \n\nSo, you basically have full time professors who are paid less than if they worked in the industry and part time professors who are basically not paid. You are going to struggle to find a perfect situation. \n\nThink about this... a course at a conference like Black Hat will run you $3000 for 16 hours of instruction over 2 days. The teacher owns that material and may have spent a few months building the course and perfecting it. If they have 20 students and a 50/50 split with the conference, they walk away with $30,000 \n\nWhat about Udemy? Based on this page ([https://blog.teachinguide.com/how-much-do-udemy-instructors-make/](https://blog.teachinguide.com/how-much-do-udemy-instructors-make/)), the top instructors can make over a half million dollars per course. The average instructor who sells 1000 course enrollments makes $5000. They record that once and sit and let the money roll in. \n\nSo, if these options are available to industry professionals who comprise most of the part time positions, why would they teach you for what averages out to minimum wage? \n\nNow, take all of that knowledge about professors and factor in some of the things that you have said, \"extremely high expectations\" and \"it's hard\" and \"dedicate more time than you ever have before.\" Cybersecurity is a serious profession...I would expect these things to be true. I would also expect the dropout rate to be even higher because employers have high expectations of someone graduating from a cybersecurity program and high expectations of someone graduating from Fanshawe because previous programs have developed amazingly employable individuals. \n\nStick with it and glean as much as you can. Try to learn from the professors that care and acknowledge the effort they are putting in, especially the part time professors who are giving up their personal time not for the money (as many students seem to think) but because they want you to succeed. Accept that there will be professors that don't care and courses that are poorly designed and complain about them, hope that they are improved upon by those that do care. \n\nAt the end of the day, this is just a first step in your career and it may be painful at times, but it will prove valuable in the end.",

I did not realize however that I would basically be learning from slides full of spelling errors and no punctuation. There are a couple good professors who spend the time to go over the concepts with you but the rest expect you to learn advanced material and concepts from point formed slides. \n\nI do not care what the professors are paid. That is irrelevant. If a cook at a restaurant undercooked your food and just said \"well I don't get paid enough,\" you would not accept that. \n\nI am currently passing all my courses but I am barely passing operating systems because our professor doesn't want to teach. I mean, he literally doesn't teach anything. He uses someone else's slides, posts them near the end of the week and then refuses to review any concepts. Additionally, we were told that all class time would be recorded but he refuses. Why? Because he isn't teaching. He literally sits there silent for 2 hours unless you say something. \n\nLiterally half of our content is recycled from previous semesters and professors and many course plans and modules are empty templates. The effort is abysmal. Again, with the exception of a couple professors.\n\nWe can make all the excuses we want for them but there is no room for that. The school is paid by students for instruction from professionals.\n\nThe students should not just be ignored by the associate dean, program coordinator and program manager. It is unacceptable.  When you ask a question and the program coordinator responds with \"LOL,\" there is a clear lack of professionalism.\n\nYou don't learn a subject like ethics without a proper lecture and discussion. That is literally how we arrive at ethical conclusions. Instead, we get a 1 minute and 22 second video that was recorded for a previous term. Absurd. I have gone to the public library and joined small learning sessions that were 100% more informative and that was free.\n\nThere are no peer tutors available and they are still unsure if there are professional tutors available. So in other words, here is a link to a service that doesn't exist. Great job, Fanshawe.",

You should ask where that money goes and why it wasn't invested in better professors. If someone teaches a course, they 100% should give it their best effort, but like all jobs that under pay, you get what you pay for. You are paying a lot, but the college is not passing it on to the professors that they hire to teach you, which is exactly why you should care. You should pay attention to the current contract negotiations as this is part of the discussion. \n\nThink about the conversation that happens: \n\n&gt;Fanshawe: *Hello Expert in the Industry, will you work for less than minimum wage, updated the materials for free, spend two weeks updating and laying out the course in FOL for free, and grade the exam for free?*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Expert 1: *No*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fanshawe: *Hello New Expert in the Industry, will you work for less than minimum wage, spend two weeks updating and laying out the course in FOL for free, and grade the exam for free?*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Expert 2: *No*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fanshawe: *Hello Person in the Industry, will you work for less than minimum wage, reuse previous material, and grade the exam for free?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Person: *No*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fanshawe: *Hello Person in the Industry, will you work for less than minimum wage, teach asynchronously using previous material, and grade the exam for free?*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Person: *Yes*\n\nIn a perfect world, you would have experienced and trained fulltime faculty that knows what they are talking about teaching you. In a slightly less perfect world, you would have industry experts with experience in industry training teaching you. In an imperfect world, you would have industry experts teaching you. In the current world, you have whoever says yes teaching you. \n\nThis ties back to the very first point made on the union's recommendation for rejecting the college contract offer a few weeks ago: [https://www.collegefaculty.org/2022/01/31/five-reasons-to-reject-the-cecs-forced-offer/](https://www.collegefaculty.org/2022/01/31/five-reasons-to-reject-the-cecs-forced-offer/)\n\nAgain, I completely agree that you shouldn't have to care about this. You should simply pay for your education and know that you are getting a quality education. Instead, you are forced to care because you are not getting a quality education.",

If you are that unhappy with the service you are getting, perhaps there are other paths that would better serve you? \n\nAccording to the CYB website, assuming you are not an international student, you will spend just shy of $12,000 CAD on this program. \n\nFor $11,000 USD, you could subscribe to two years of Offensive Security's new Learn Unlimited program and obtain your PEN-200 (OSCP), PEN-300, WEB-200, WEB-300, EXP-301, EXP-312, and SOC-200. If you are taking this course because you have an interest in penetration testing, this could be a better path. \n\nFor $2,400 GBP (\\~$4200 CAD), you could take the Security Blue Team BTL1 and BTL2 courses. If you're interested in working within a SOC, that might be a great place to start. \n\nThe great think about the cybersecurity industry right now is that post secondary may not be something that you need. There are a lot of employers that put value in certifications. \n\nThere are some that feel that they can spend time on TryHackMe and HackTheBox and that should be sufficient, I disagree with that approach. That is not sufficient... but proven training programs are a different story. \n\nThere are also tons of great training courses provided by vendors like NotSoSecure and InGuardians and a number of other companies at conferences and many of these are offered virtually right now. They are expensive, but depending on what you want to do, it may send you down a valid path. \n\nAnyway, if you're interested in sharing what your goals are, I'm happy to help recommend learning paths that may prove helpful. Finding yourself struggling due to poor education is a crappy place to be in.",

Most of the points you bring up have to do with students not doing enough when it's really the opposite, students being required to do way too much. Just one example with labs requiring about 2-3hours to complete when really sometimes they are well over 8hrs to do. Meanwhile you're forced to use dogsh\\*t software that crashes on everyones computer but because it runs fine for the prof too bad so sad for students. That's a real positive atmosphere right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll gladly argue over any point you want to bring up and I have well over 20 just like the amount of virtual machines/variations of windows 10 we are required to use. Absolute nonsense of organization. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you want to pay thousands of dollars for someone to just read powerpoint slides to you, that your given to read on your own time anyway go for it. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nOP is correct and I am a current Fanshawe Student, wish I wasn't. It's called pot commited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this saves someone the troubles",

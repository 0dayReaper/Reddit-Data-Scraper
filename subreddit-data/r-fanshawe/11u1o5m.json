    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI want to share my experience with the Cyber Security program offered by Fanshawe \n\nFirstly, the program was created by Dan and Karen, who are a couple and designed it without any cyber security experience. After creating the program, they both resigned and Dan is no longer the director, which means the program is now run by another person.\n\nSecondly, the program only offers online classes, with Dan teaching the course in a monotone voice. He spends two hours reading power points, which are not related to the graded lab activities. In fact, he restricts the ability to open up the activities until you have read 100 slides of the PowerPoints he has been ranting on via zoom.\n\nMoreover, other classes like Linux and Web scripting are taught by underpaid part-time staff who are still working on their higher education. This makes the course poorly presented and staff members frustrated and overworked. They have been trying to hire two professors to help with the load, but unfortunately, they have failed.\n\nTo make matters worse, the classes are asynchronous, and there is no guidance on labs, which makes it extremely difficult for students to follow and understand the course. As someone who has already taken the program, I would strongly advise against applying for it.\n\nIf you are currently enrolled and feel the same way as I do, please help us get a refund. Let's spread the word and help other potential students avoid this program.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this post, and I hope this helps someone out there.",

This happens regularly. You can \"call bullshit\" all you want. These are facts that have been taken to every available channel and they do absolutely nothing. \n\nWe understand that we have to work hard and put our hours in. The majority of us are doing just that. All we want is a school that is accountable for its failures. I am passing just fine. So this is not a \"failing\" student who \"doesn't try\". This is a student who is tired of people coming on here and disputing peoples experiences because they had a different one.\n\nWe have had professors leave to make grilled cheese mid class and not come back. This same professor never taught a single lesson. None. He admitted to having failed the very program he was \"teaching\".\n\nWe have had a professor who showed up to 4 of 14 sessions and then flipped out if we brought it up.\n\nWe learned scripting asynchronously with PowerPoint slides that consisted if 10-12 pictures of scripts that had nothing to do with the weekly lab.\n\nWe have had a professor release videos outlining his expectations for a class from 2019, only to find out he had different expectations of us and just didn't bother to create a new videos.\n\nWe were belittled and treated like complete shit by Dan and Karen. Karen literally told our entire class that we were \"useless\" in our second class with her because we couldn't convert binary to hex, hex to binary etc... in our heads, before we were even taught to do so. She is awful. Knowledgeable but horribly rude.\n\nWe are going into our fourth learning term and have never touched a router, switch, server... nothing. We sit in the same room as them and do it virtually on GNS3. Why? \"Because they don't have time to teach us\".\n\nI could go on for days. We have brought all of this and soooo much more to every possible channel and all we have received is empty promises and unanswered emails/phone calls.\n\nSay what you want but this is not acceptable when you are paying thousands of dollars for a program. As stated before, most of us are just sticking together and learning what we can on our own because we are being supplied with an abysmal education from Fanshawe. I do not want to hear about the part time staff bullshit either. If you can't offer a quality program, don't offer it at all. Your staffing issues are not an excuse to rip students off for their money.",

            "comment": "Alright, If you want to complain about the program could you have at least been factual. I am a graduate from this program and have stayed involved in it.\n\n1. The program was created by Dan and Karen with no experience in Cyber Security. This is true, however they both worked in the School of IT in CTN/CTY since their inception. The program overall is similar but done to a higher level.\n2. Dan was never the program coordinator. I dont know where on earth you found that. From the programs beginning in 2017 to 2020 Karen was the program coordinator. She then stepped down in the spring of 2020 and James Robertson took over as coordinator. The program manager has always been Shannon.\n3. As far as part time teachers, yes. They are underpaid. They cannot find talent to become instructors because they want a minimum of a Masters and prefer a Phd. I was in my second co-op and started working permanently full time while doing school, my salary was $80k. Why on earth would someone with a Masters start working for the college at 67k.\n4. If you dont like the way labs are being presented, how would you rather they are? Have you actually asked the instructor to try and present them in that way?\n5. Dan would preach this every class, you are in an advanced diploma in highly involved technical field. You need to be able and willing to learn greater expansion of the topics on your own. I think you missed this.",

Getting into the field still very young has meant that I will plateau which is still something I struggle to make peace with because i want to always learn and face new challenges. Currently the most graduates from a starting class has been generously 23%. Very few have gotten into security right away. A lot of us have ended up in other areas of IT because people have learned that they dont want to be responsible for the preventative controls if something happens.\n\nMany students in general see my for example at 20 after three semesters making $80k and think its easy money. Its not. People get a reality check, they complain about this program because of the reality check but this is also the reality of the field. Its not a field where you can just show up at an interview.\n\nI wrote in my own post which reddit didnt share but its on my profile. I think CYB is better and will absolutely get people into a SOC1, but i think alternatives exist like CTY+ISM+ Sec+ and CISSP.\n\nI dont want to be rude, but i refrain from saying security is a specialty. Its a discipline now just the same as networking or system admins. The specializations exist within security, GRC, PenTest, Forensics, Incident Response, Vulnerability Management, and Operations being the general field. These are where peoples careers end. Once you go into a specialization, good luck moving to another, it can even be hard to go back to operations if in a specialization for a longer period of time. So starting in a SOC means that you only have three levels to go in operations, and then a new refined specialization like pentesting. The average time someone is in a SOC from level 1 to 3 and then onto a specialization is two years.\n\nSo a grad from this program at 21 will be in a specialization more then likely by 24 at which point there is nowhere to else to go and they have roughly 35 years until retirement.\n\nGrads will start as a SOC 1 more then likely unless they are really good. They will work to SOC 3, then choose a path of specialization or continuing in operations as a specialization and going into engineering. From Architecture, or any other specialization they can move into the management chain. Once in a specialization, it may have a rank system Jr, Int, Sr pentesters for example. Ultimately though it will not change anything. That is the specialization they are stuck in. Once in a specialization you can only move up by going into management or research and development.\n\nThe security hierarchy kinda goes like this:\n\n|^(Management)|^(Operations)|^(Specialization)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|CISO|Architect|Digital Forensics|\n|Manager|Engineer|Incident Response|\n||SOC 3|Pen Testers|\n||SOC 2|Governance|\n||SOC 1|Research|",

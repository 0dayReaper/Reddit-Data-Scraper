    "postText": "Hello fellow falcons!\n\nTL;DR I graduated June 2022 and have struggled to get a job. I need suggestions\n\nI graduated from the Business - Marketing (Coop) program last June. I made the Dean\u2019s Honor Roll during my 4th term. I am bilingual. My only shortcoming is work experience, as 2/3 of the jobs listed in my resume are not marketing (sales-customer service).\n\nThe weird part is when I finished classes in December 2022, I started applying and got calls from different companies in as little as 3 days. I had to go out of Canada due to visa reasons (international student) and when I came back in September 2022, I could say confidently that I\u2019ve sent out over 100 applications and no one has gotten back to me. I have changed my resume at least five times, I have tried including a cover letter even. \n\nWhat do? I want to start working in marketing and have no idea.",

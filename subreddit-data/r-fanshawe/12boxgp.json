You\u2019re grades make a great improvement on this. As well as your regular resume. It\u2019s best to find your own outside of the college with companies.",

            "comment": "I graduated from that program. Very few of us got a co-op. During our first year of co-ops, our coordinator told us to only apply to the co-ops that we wanted because if we turn down too many then we would be banned from the co-op board. That turned out to be a bad idea as our cherry picking of the board resulted in many of us not getting a co-op. Later years, we would just apply to anything that showed up but even still many of us did not get a co-op.\n\nThe reality is that they were very few co-op positions and they were tons of students applying to everything. More and more companies are pulling out of Fanshawes co-op board. When I was there in my final year, a company pulled all of their co-op positions only days after posting them, normally those postings stay for a while.\n\nWhat really bugged me though was that our co-op coordinator told everyone in our first year that everyone who applied got a co-op and that the only people who didn't get a co-op were the lazy students who didn't bother applying. In hindsight, it seemed very sleazy and almost like they were trying to get us to stay in the program and then once we got to our co-op semester it felt like the rug was pulled from under us.",

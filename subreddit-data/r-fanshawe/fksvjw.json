    "postText": "So to start off I understand the tough situation Fanshawe is being put in and I highly doubt we will be returning to classes this year. That being said I'm being told two different stories by my profs and res staff. So residents staff just sent out an email offering us a refund of our lasts month rent ($955) if we move out by March 22. If we do take them up on that offer we cannot move back in and in the small possibility classes do start up again I will have to travel 2 hours each day to get to class. Just this morning though I still have profs making announcements that our Labs will resume **when** not if we come back. \n\n\n\nI think the deadline to move out should at least be extended until our semester is completely figured out. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Being offered $955 to move out of res before march 22nd, profs are implying we are still returning april 6th. Deadline to move out should be extended until are semester is figured out.",

Fanshawe says classes will resume April 6th, so what the hell am I supposed to do. I'm just thinking of moving out and get an Airbnb if classes resume again. Only way I can see it working out.",

I would make your decision after some research and base it on that. It seems that the government has said '3 weeks' to ease us all into the idea. I wouldn't count on classes resuming, everything will likely be completed online. At this point it's up to you to figure out where you'd rather be when the infectious numbers rise; at Fanshawe in residence or at home?",

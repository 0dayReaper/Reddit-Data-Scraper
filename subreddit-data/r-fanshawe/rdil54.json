None of the classes have to be in person.\n\nAm I the only one feeling that we are going to be the test people for this new variant? We will go to school for awhile and then something will come up and then they will decide to close the schools again? I don't agree with how this is being handled when the cases are ramping up.",

We do not need anything that would dissuade people who might be sick from staying home and keeping the rest of us safe.",

I definitely don't feel safe with the case counts rising rapidly, especially since more of the cases today were in vaccinated people as opposed to unvaccinated. I feel like there will be a lot of quarantine for students and they will miss a lot because many programs don't have online options anymore.\n\nI dont see a smooth ride ahead. I feel like remote learning, although having its own challenges, is a much more sensible and safe option.",

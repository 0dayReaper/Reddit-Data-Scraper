    "postText": "The union representing full time and partial load faculty has given notice that a strike action will start on Friday, March 18, 2022. In the event of a strike, all classes (both in-person and online) will be cancelled, including full-time, part-time, field and clinical placements, apprenticeship and continuing education classes.\n\nFanshawe\u2019s first priority remains students\u2019 learning. We will do what we can to ensure that each student will have the opportunity to complete the winter semester. All student services remain open during a strike and students will continue to have access to course material on FanshaweOnline (FOL). A full listing of services can be found on the myFanshawe portal under Student Resources [https://www.fanshawec.ca/studentresources](https://www.fanshawec.ca/studentresources)). Students, please note for your login: you need to include fanshawe\\\\ in front of your username (same username and password you use for FanshaweOnline).\n\nIf you feel stressed or anxious and would like to talk to someone, please contact Counselling and Accessibility Services at [counselling@fanshawec.ca](mailto:counselling@fanshawec.ca) or 519-452-4282. You can also use our chat feature ([https://chat.fanshawec.ca](https://chat.fanshawec.ca)) to talk with one of our student services staff.\n\nA list of questions and answers that provide information about what will happen in the event of a strike, what services will remain open during a strike as well as how to cross a picket line can be found in the email that was sent to all student, also found here: [https://mailchi.mp/263e09308e3e/academic-strike-22\\_questions-answers\\_15-mar-2022](https://mailchi.mp/263e09308e3e/academic-strike-22_questions-answers_15-mar-2022).\n\nIn the coming days, the Fanshawe website will be updated with more information and we will continue to email students as information becomes available.",

Care about the professors because they\u2019re the face of the college and the front line workers that dictate success stats, and leave your paying customers with an impression whether positive or negative. There\u2019s been no time for feedback on exams and oral practicals which is a disservice to students. Also, some of the best profs I have encountered are \u201cgig\u201d workers- reminds me of Walmart which is scary. There\u2019s no stability, fair wages, or even a reason to stick around, what a true shame. Don\u2019t say a corporation cares when all actions display a  self-serving attitude.",

I also appreciate that you're a person in charge of social media and have to post things that are PR friendly. There are many students who feel (rightly or wrongly) that Fanshawe does not care about the students greatly, and merely says it does. \n\nThere are many students that have been dissatisfied with their programs since the pandemic began. Statements like \"Fanshawe's first priority remains students' learning\" feel disingenuous, and come across as finger-pointy and ultimately tone-deaf. \n\nI can understand u/Nokshush's reaction here. My first response to reading that statement was also one of frustration, in addition to not feeling heard.\n\nMaybe none of that is news to you, u/FanshaweC. Either way, I get that you're a person doing your job and hope that you don't end up at the brunt end of peoples' frustrations. The internet can be a callous place sometimes.",

Evan for years has been using rehashed pdfs from windows xp era and doesnt even hold lectures and marks from screenshots lmfao.\n\nProfessors dont even show up to lectures in 3rd term and consistently dodge and blame others. \n\nIve been and many other students have been complaining about this and all your faculty and dean do is shrug and say it is out of their control. \n\nIts money first. Professors 2nd. The students completely last. Honestly, students aint even in the picture. What a disgrace.\n\nI hope maybe you in the PR team can show them a screenshot of this message. Maybe they will take disciplinary action on the profs that are down right shit and can be replaced for free using youtube tutorials.",

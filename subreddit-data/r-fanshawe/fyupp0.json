When I lived on residence, I got all my work done and studied everyday. \n\nEver since I moved back home I haven't been able to get much if anything done. We were given the option to \"defer\" our next semester until January 2021, but not sure if it's worth waiting that long.\n\nMostly since this coronavirus thing started to get outta hand my grades have been slipping a bit. Just gotta keep yourself motivated.",

I miss being in-class, to a point, but I've always been a homebody and I've been in post-secondary for like... 10 years now, on and off, so I have been able to refine my methods and structure my day.\n\nStructure is extremely important. As much as I want to, I can't go to bed at 3am every night and expect to be productive the next day. I miss out on things, but I go to bed at midnight or 1am at the latest on weekends, and it's done wonders for my mental health as well as my productivity.\n\nI divide my day into blocks, and each block has a min and max for what I am able to do, so I prevent both laziness and burnout.\n\nNote that I'm not working atm and have savings to live off of, so there's an enormous amount of stress on a lot of students that I... am fortunate enough to not have to deal with right now. So my circumstances aren't the same as everyone else's, and also that I've had a lot of practice with being in post-secondary and managing my time and my emotions/mental health.",

Home is my least effective location but I've been doing research and talking to my academic advisor (definitely suggest it's been really helpful to have someone checking in on me and keeping me updated). It's slowly getting better and I'm focusing a bit more, but I've really struggled.\n\nThe suggestion depends on what the struggle/problem is. I found during the day my family distracts me, so sometimes I just work during the late night/early morning when there are less distractions. If your work is overwhelming break it down into smaller chunks, like a test is chapters a-b or an essay down by paragraphs. Having a workspace helps altho that's not nessecarily an option for everyone rn. If you do keep it as clean and minimalist as possible. If it's your phone get app blockers or turn notifications off. Setting timers is also very effective, 20mins work 5min break.\n\nThere's lots of suggestions, but it kind of depends on the problem for the solution. If that doesn't help DM me or reply and I can try and help further.",

Teaching myself 7 courses, doing all the work and studying for the tests has been massively unpleasant. If I was told that my course next year was going to be online, I wouldn't enroll. \n\nSo far I've dealt with it by focusing on the class in which my grade is the lowest, and making sure i do the work in my bird classes to bring my average up.",

There's a good amount of clubs people don't know about but have several members. It's seems clubs are more active this year than last.\n\nIdk about business program specifically. But entrepeneurial services is good here.",

            "comment": "I'm a mature student, very mature, living off campus, in the business program. The professors are easy to get along with and they actually seem to care about your education. There is a strong emphasis on practical examples and hands-on learning. It was easy to make friends, but I'm pretty outgoing. some of the work is hard, but that's what you're supposed to be doing. Since I live off campus I can't say anything about the nightlife, but during the day the campus seems active and vibrant, and I see a lot of postings for night activities.",

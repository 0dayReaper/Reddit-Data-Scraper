    "postText": "Having to spend 7k on a semester where we have classes and actually get to learn something is justified, but why were all the students asked to pay $6500 for the co-op semester? We didn\u2019t attend classes because there were none (its co-op) and secondly, the college didn\u2019t even  help us secure jobs for the co-op, we had to find jobs ourselves. All the students were distressed about the situation. When we brought this problem up to the program coordinator, she had no answers and just brushed it off by saying \u201cI am very sorry but I do not have the control over that, I know it\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s the college that decides that\u201d. There\u2019s nothing that can reverse the situation now, but I am just putting this out there for any interested students for the future.",

Also schools don't make more from International students (it's a common misunderstanding). The province subsidizes domestic students so if you pay $7k, the province gives the university $x and it is virtually the same as what international students pay. Taxpayers, of course, wouldn't be subsidizing international students so they pay the full bill.",

There are co-op fees but I didn't have to pay anything. \n\nAll classes have a class representative.

I was in a co-op program and that was our program's experience too.\n\nWe also never paid tuition during co-op terms unless you chose to take classes in advance during that time instead of working. We did have co-op fees, but those were during the regular school term tuition (and they were no where near 7k).\n\nYour program seems to list this as an \"internship\" on the Fanshawe site and not a co-op like other courses, so I'm wondering if that is how they are getting around it. It also looks like an international-only program which are huge money grabs :/",

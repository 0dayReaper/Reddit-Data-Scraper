    "postText": "Is there anyone here who wants to apply for a nursing program for your next path this Fall 2023?\n\nI am an international student and I have heard that they just accept about 1-2 international students in the nursing program. Is it true?\n\nOur teachers said that about 200 students dropped out last semester this year, so do you think the acceptance rate this year will be high? Do you think we still have a chance to get in nursing with 3.8 -3.9 GPA this year?",

            "comment": "Which nursing program are you most interested in? They are both super competitive, but the RN (Bachelor's of Nursing degree) is the most competitive program out of the two. \n\n[Here](https://www.fanshawec.ca/admission-finance/how-to-apply/competitive-programs) is a link that has information about the competitive programs. For the Collaborative Nursing program (the RN one) the website states: \"College applicants with early offers likely [had] an average above 90%.\" That being said, I know it's often encouraged to have a 4.0 or higher GPA to get into the program. \n\nThe Practical Nursing program (the RPN one) is slightly easier. According to that same link, there are only 94 seats in the program (versus the 125 for the RN one) and \"those who have at least an 80% average in each of their required courses, as well as at least a B+ in each of their post-secondary courses.\" \n\nFor both, you will also have to undergo the CASPer Assessment in order to apply. This is new to Fall 2023 and the assessment is meant to test your situational judgment as well as \"[evaluate] aspects of your social intelligence and professionalism such as ethics, empathy, problem-solving and collaboration\". You can read more about it [here](https://acuityinsights.app/casper/).\n\nIn short, it will be difficult (but not impossible!) to be accepted for either program.",

Yes, you can theoretically get in with a 3.8-3.9, but they tend to favour those with a 4.0 over those with a 3.8-3.9. \n\nThe data I provided doesn't really discern one way or the other if international students are counted amongst the available seats, but given what you said about only 1-2 international students being accepted kind of tracks; u/FanshaweC would be able to shed more light on that, but I do remember hearing something about how they tend to take more domestic students than international ones. It makes sense given there are only 95 seats in the program and a lot of domestic students who apply.\n\nTo answer your question about acceptance rates: only 26% of those who applied were given an offer of admission.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am currently recruiting for my master\u2019s thesis which is exploring the lived experiences of emerging adults who have lost a friend to suicide. I chose this topic based on my own experience of losing friends to suicide \ud83d\udd4a. This exploration will be done through photography (i.e., asking participants to take photographs that represent their experience with grief). \n\nThe criteria includes:\n\n- lost a friend to suicide, \n- were between the ages of 18 and 29 at the time of the loss, and \n- have experienced grief as a result of the suicide loss.\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible and would like to participate, feel free to DM me. I would also be happy to talk about it further if you have any questions!\n\nEdit to add: This study has been approved by Trinity Western University\u2019s HREB board (#22G22).",

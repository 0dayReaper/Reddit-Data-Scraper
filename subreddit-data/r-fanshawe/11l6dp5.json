Most only pay around $18-$25/hr and the work is brutal. I originally wanted to work in a hospital setting too, but in the 17 years since i graduated I\u2019ve never seen a job posting for a youth worker in a hospital setting\u2026\nI now work for the school board, but again, work is brutal. We get beat up fairly regularly and make poverty level wages. I\u2019d love to encourage you to enter the field but everyone I know is desperately trying to get out. All of my coworkers are currently back in school trying to get new careers. \nIt\u2019s an okay career when you\u2019re young and have the energy, but now in my late 30s it\u2019s just exhausting.",

The pay has gotten worse since I graduated 17 years ago. Group Homes still pay the exact same wages as they used to, which means the pay isn\u2019t keeping up with inflation at all.",

When I was working as a cyw it was tough to find a full-time position out of school, lots of p/t or relief positions available though. You really had to work your way up to the jobs with slightly better pay or a more stable schedule.",

Evetyone I know who completed that program loved it&amp;is still working in the field.\nI can also agree. The actual industry is what burns people out. The child welfare system is an absolute mess.\nThat being said. If you have a clear mission as you how you want to service children&amp;youth in need, then dont let anything scare you off. But be realistic about what it takes to earn your stripes so to speak. Be prepared to be around some really sh** human being who chose to be cyws, I mean sexist racist classist ableist human beings that look down on disadvantaged kids&amp;get dome weird ego gratification off being holier than though enough to stoop down to those kids levels. I know plently who wanted to be cops so they became social workers first, they were abaolute scum. \nBe prepared for your managers to be even shittier. \nIts also not a job for someone with small children unless you have nerves of steel and a ton of rmunwavering family/part we/friend support, you will be so exhausted you wont have the energy for your own children at times.\nAt the end of the day it's about the kids&amp;what you can provide them.\nDo HEAVY research on front line agencies that you can volunteer with. Gives you a clearer vision of a career pathway, and whuch agencies are tue ones to stsy away from.\nSolid people with REAL ethics grounded in human rights, are need greatly in this field!!!\nAnd yes. There are jobs in healthcare settings!!! Whatever you choose good luck. We need solid people in child welfare/childrens mental health fields who are dedicated to fighting for childrens rights.",

I don't personally know any jobs at childrens hospital for cyc, I find most jobs if it's in the social work area require at least a bachelors or masters unfortunately. If it's something your passionate about, I'd say go for it. There's different areas you can work in so you won't get bored. Good luck to whatever you choose!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Rykker from the Recruitment team at Fanshawe College. In my job I help prospective students right from the initial stages of their application to college all the way through to confirming their offer. I travel all over Ontario speaking to applicants about programs, services, and campus life, and I also run a lot of activities on campus!\n\nFor a little background about myself, I am a Fanshawe alumni (2016) and studied in the Public Relations - Corporate Communications Graduate Program. I am also a Londoner so I can answer questions about the Community too.\n\nI understand and appreciate that this subreddit is a public forum for both applicants and current students, but I wanted to provide a space for anyone who is on Reddit looking for answers to ask Fanshawe directly. I will frequently check back here to answer any questions that people have about their application, programs, and more (I don't think the subreddit is quite busy enough for an AMA but I would be open to doing that in the future if people think it would work).\n\nPlease understand that in my role I predominantly deal with prospective students. If you have questions as a current student I will do my best to find an answer, but I do not regularly deal with issues related to being a student. Feel free to drop a question and I'll get back to you with an answer!\n\nEveryone stay safe and healthy and we'll see you on the other side of this thing.\n\n\\-Rykker, Fanshawe College",

When I graduated from a different course, they called me asking if I had a job and if I would recommend the program. I told them no I wasn't working in my field, and they asked if I had a part time job. I told them I was still working my part time job I had during school and they said they'd mark me down as having a job.\n\nSo sure, 90% may be employed after school. But that's made up mainly of people not in their field, and it doesn't take into consideration the 3/4 who drop out due to shit teachers.",

You can find the results of the 2016-17 KPI (this is the final time we will do KPI in this format, so it is the most recent data posted on the website):  \n[https://www.fanshawec.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/kpi/grad\\_report2017.pdf](https://www.fanshawec.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/kpi/grad_report2017.pdf)\n\nTo reiterate a point earlier, different programs will have different outcomes. A student studying in Aircraft Maintenance may have a higher chance of immediately finding relevant work than other, less in demand fields. I'm sorry that your experience at Fanshawe was not what you hoped it would be, but others do come out of their studies with relevant work opportunities.",

It also appears they are self-reported, based on the fact that the entrance number is far lower than expected: (ie. Game Development only having 3 entrants in the latest graduation rate KPI report).\n\nFanshawe's employment KPI's are based on phone surveys, where they quote the number based on how many students they could contact, which is generally half or less of the graduating class. This means the numbers don't necessarily represent the performance of the programs.",

At this time, our May intake is going online and international students will be able to complete up to half of their curriculum in their home country given the circumstances. Keep looking to see how things change, and stay safe!",

It was lucrative space and many different academic areas threw their hat in the ring.\n\nThe move downtown was a massive undertaking for all academic and strategic departments involved. Obviously there was going to be some shortcomings and errors in that process. I hope you will understand that the move was never going to be perfect and we are working to grow into the space downtown while addressing all students needs as best as possible.\n\nHopefully this response finds you well. Stay safe and healthy during this surreal time.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm starting my second year of Game Design and Development in September, and thought I'd give the first years a bit of guidance. \n\nWhat you'll need:\n\nSoftware:\n\t\n    * Autodesk 3DS Max\n    * Autodesk Mudbox\n    * Adobe creative cloud\n    * Crazybump\n\t\n(I would recommend that you get Quixel nDo as well)\n\n\nHardware:\n    Desktop:\n    \t\n        * I7 processor\n        * 16GB Ram\n        * Gtx 970 or better video card\n   \n   Other:\n\n        * Wacom Intuos pro (or Cintiq)\n        * Wacom Stylus (Must be compatible with a 22\" Cintiq)\n\t\nOptional:\n\n\t-DSLR Camera\n\t-Webcam and Microphone\n\t-Ergonomic Mouse\n\t-Drawing glove\n\t-Good headphones\n\t-Digital Tutors subscription\n\t-Colorus Photoshop extension\n        -Laptop \t\n\nFirst Year Classes:\n\tSemester 1:\n\t\n\t3D-Intro - Most of this class is just learning how to use 3DS Max and what it is capable of\n\t\n\tDigital Drawing 1 - You'll mostly be spending your time in this on grey values and shading. DO NOT TRACE EVER. You'll instantly get a 0.\n\t\n\tArt and Design Survey - This is basically just looking into architecture and famous previous artists. Possibly the easiest and mind-numbing class of note taking, but at least it's somewhat interesting\n\t\n\tGame Theory - Most of this class is based on story building and mechanics in a game, and the difference between different types of gameplay.\n\t\n\tAnimation 1 - Most of this class is hard surface animating, stuff like cars and boxes, nothing organic.\n\t\n\tCharacter Design Anatomy 1 - Both the worst, and best class. For the first half of the semester you have to memorize every bone and muscle in the human body. The second half is where the fun is, you get to spend your time drawing and designing characters.\n\t\n\t\n\tSemester 2:\n\t\n\tActing for Animators 1 - Half of this class is about acting like a fool and being okay with it, the other half is learning to animate people. If you think your walk cycle is good enough, you're wrong.\n\t\n\tDigital Drawing 2 - A lot of this time is learning to concepting process and display sheets. You get to design your own logo!\n\t\n\tTechnology Survey - Pretty boring note taking class. Teaches you how to build a reference image library\n\t\n\tTexturing 1 - Prepare to spend hours at a time for your UV unwraps, and then find out that that time could have been cut into a tenth. (This is when nDo comes in handy)\n\t\n\tModelling 1 - Pretty straight forward, model stuff. \n\t\n\tCharacter Design Anatomy 2 - This is when you start to work with Mudbox. It takes about a dozen hours in order to get a good feel for the software, so don\u2019t be shy.\n\t\n\tGame Design 1 - Pretty easy class. Mostly note taking and such.\n\t\nTips for survival:\n\t\n        -Get an external hard drive, back up everything on it.\n\n\t-DON'T GO INTO THIS PROGRAM IF YOU THINK ITS GOING TO BE ABOUT PLAYING GAMES\n\n\t-Don\u2019t fall asleep in Krista's class\n\n\t-ALWAYS ask for feedback on a piece 48 hours before handing it in\n\n\t-Record yourself doing various activities (Walking/running/jumping/strafing) for reference\n\n\t-STAY SUPER ORGANIZED\n\n\t-Spend the time and get references, but remember that it's better to have good references than a lot of references.\n\n\t-If a Pellow gives you a mark that you don't agree with, 99.999% of the time it's the mark you deserve\n\n\t-Get acquainted with 3DS Max and Mudbox as early as you can, it helps, trust me\n\n\t-As a rule of thumb, spend twice as long on an assignment as it's weight (10 hours for 5%, 40 hours on 20%)\n\n\t-Start on your final AS SOON as you possibly can\n\n\t-Make a schedule\n\n\t-DON'T PUT STUFF OFF FOR THE WEEKEND, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME IN 48 HOURS TO FINISH 4 ASSIGNMENTS\n\n\t-Designate your time wisely. A 60% in a class you're failing is better than a 90% in a class you're doing well in.\n\n\t-Don't ask friends for feedback on a piece, they will encourage you. Ask someone that doesn't like you, they'll tear it apart and notice every little issue.\n\n\t-If you fail a class, but remain above 40%, you can take an upgrade (an assignment that can earn you the extra 10% you need).\n\n\t-If you can't finish an assignment on time, hand in what you can. Part marks are better than no marks\n\n\t-Don't try to be as good as some of the artists that have been doing this for years, that will only discourage you.\n\n\t-Get a group of friends from the program together to work on stuff, always good to bounce ideas off each other\n\n\t-If the way the teacher does something isn't the same way you like to do it, talk to them and let them know.\n\n\t-POST ON THE FACEBOOK GROUP. Seriously, it helps a lot.\n\t\n\t",

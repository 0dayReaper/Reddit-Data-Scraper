(Dell etc)\n\n\\- Preferred model? (XPS etc)\n\nJust trying to get some feedback as I have been using Macbook for a while now as my primary, I see some good sales at Bestbuy and want to get used to Windows again sooner but want to make sure it is future proof and good for the course",

Just need something with some decent horse power for running virtual machines, docker desktop, k8s etc. and good storage.  Oh and good battery life. \n\nSide note: this program was awesome when I took it.  I took the networking stream (if they even have different streams now) and really enjoyed it and have a successful career in the field as a result.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I'm in a similar boat.  Here's what I've learned:\n\n&gt;Should I get a Workstation specific laptop or will a standard laptop or gaming laptop do just as well?\n\n* Speaking with a Program Rep during the Open House back in September, it was mentioned that the program will be doing a lot of Virtual Machines work.  Not an answer to your question, but maybe some more information...\n\n&gt;How do I confirm if it has 64 bit Multicore w/ Intel-VT or AMD-V\n\n* I've been Googling it.  Find a laptop that looks good, look up the processor, see if it meets the requirements.  Not an easy, quick fix answer.\n* Personal Experience:  I think all but one or two laptops I've looked (both Intel and AMD) have been good.  The ones that weren't were older Intel-based machines.\n\n&gt;How picky should I be on Intel Gens (8th vs 12th) (i5 vs i7)\n\n* Personal Option:  Newer is better.\n\nPreferred brand? (Dell etc)  Preferred model? (XPS ect)\n\n* No real answer\n* More Personal Option:  I'm looking at a Lenovo Legion 5.  Last week it was an Acer.  Next week who knows.  Based on some stuff I've read (I think the search string was \"What makes a good virtual machine laptop) I'm looking at a machine that will allow me to upgrade easy.\n* Even more Personal Option:  Speaking with a friend already doing similar (but different) work, he too was stressing the import ants of RAM (he was suggesting going for the 32 if I could) and the SSD being at least 1TB\n\nAs I said:  I'm not a current student, but am willing to share what I've learned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ONE LAST THING I JUST REMEMBERED**:  The Program Rep I spoke with in September was ***very adamant*** about NOT going with a Mac.  Apparently some folks have been burned by an overzealous salesperson.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the reply\n\nSeems for the Intel-VT AMD-V stuff its pretty much standard now, but wasn't sure 100%, going through my partners Acer I was confused where it even is\n\nI knew they didn't want Mac, spoke with them a few years ago but decided to wait it out. Which is fine I suppose as if I upgraded my Mac I wanted the ARM version which can't use Windows yet anyways\n\nI guess brands like most things is opinion (PS5 vs Xbox). Right now I think either Dell or Lenovo. Just trying to understand difference of models now (T14 vs E15, XPS vs Percision vs Latitude)\n\nSo far got my search on Bestbuy narrowed to 70 computers, getting there lol",

I went through CYB which has higher spec requirements but overall I would highly recommend a Asus ROG series laptop. You can often find them on sale as well, so you can get a great price for less then a thousand bucks for the last model as new ones come out. I recently got a new one for $800 R7 5900HX, 16GB ram, 1TB NvMe Storage. Can be expanded to 32GB memory and has a second slot for another drive if you need it.",

Unsure if they provide lab equipment to run VMs remotely now but I remember having to adjust RAM allocations on my laptop constantly when I had to use a bunch of VMs for a course. The more RAM and cores the better. You'll be glad in Year 2/3. \n\nYou can use a shit laptop for probably all the networking courses.",

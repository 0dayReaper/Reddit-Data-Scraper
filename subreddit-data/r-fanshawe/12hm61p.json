What made you decide to go there? I have currently been accepted into Algonquin for MRT but want to know which school I should attend because the more research I do, the better informed decision I can make. Maybe i'll possibly see some of yall on campus lol",

I heard they can send you outside London, do you think they make considerations for people who cannot travel outside of London (like parents of young children for example)? I was looking into the program, but my son is in JK and I was worried I'd be posted in Windsor or something and have to drop out because I can't just move.",

I believe there is financial aid you can seek to help cover costs of having placement outside of town, but I know that there are sometimes people who have conflicts with out of town placement and they have been given them outside of London. I would try speaking directly to the program head or dean and also any student aid programs to see if they know more. It's been a while since I was there and luckily didn't have to worry about it myself.",

Yeah I have to drop off and pick up my son from school every day, so I can't move my residence, it's not really a money thing but a time thing. It seems there are just some programs that I can't do as a parent. I got into the program last year but am going into something else instead this year. This is exactly why I didn't go into it. That sucks.",

So, with rising costs, it will probably be close to 2500 a semester during placement, which lasts for about 14 months. It's unpaid, and it's 40 hours a week. Eventually, you will be doing shifts ranging from 7am to 3pm, 3pm to 11pm, weekends, holidays, 7 day stretches, and even some overnights near the end (11pm to 7am). Now, that isn't to discourage you, it is difficult and varied for a reason, but I want you to know what you're actually going to be doing.\n\nI was lucky enough to live at home and get placed in London, where I live, and had some financial aid (almost paid back now), so it was doable for me, but a lot of our students have part-time jobs on top of placement.",

Fanshawe MRT on a resume will be looked at above some other schools and the college can help with resume building and job applications.

My program had a fb group made by professors so you can use that if that\u2019s something available to you. I personally started a discord for my program year before school started and that\u2019s how I met all my best friends that I am still talking to almost a year after graduating. It\u2019s understandable to be nervous especially with a lot of new people, but even just asking one person is a good step. Good luck!",

She also has that reversible octopus plushie.\n\nFor real though, both of us moved here last year for school (both 24) and she's been struggling to make friends. Doesn't help that we're in a pandemic but yeah. She loves gaming and reading as well. If you're interested in making a new friend, let me know and I'll let her know.",

[Source](https://www.fanshawec.ca/why-fanshawe/campuses/toronto)\n\nAs far as I know there's no transit pass included, but don't quote me on that. Perhaps you could call to inquire?\n\nIf you were hoping for a different campus, you should also consider calling and asking if the program is offered somewhere else and see if they let you switch. It's still early, so maybe it's possible.",

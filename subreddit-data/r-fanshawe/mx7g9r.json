    "postText": "If you're looking to go into the graphic design program at Fanshawe, either wait until they revise the program or go to a different school entirely. Fanshawe has a lot of different programs that will benefit you in the industry and successfully prepare you for what life is like out of the program. This is not one of them in any way shape or form. I've taken many programs at Fanshawe prior and this was the program to make me leave and not come back. Maybe the program gets better after the first year, but the first year is an utterly worthless experience entirely. If you know anything from high school level art, you know more than the entire first year of this course has to offer. Some lectures offer little to no actual learning, with nonsensical topics that have nothing to do with graphic design and are thinly veiled under the guise of \"Well all art and culture is related right?\". I'm not saying that their aren't people who can get something out of this course, I'm sure that some people can, but with this being a 3 year program that could be a 2 year program and costs 3000$+ dollars a semester plus supplies not covered, you'd expect to be learning something worthwhile. I previously had been in industry and worked with many different graphic designers closely on projects, so when asking them if the techniques being taught were industry standard, I would expect a yes, but the resounding answer was no from all sides. When being asked what any of the traditional art i was doing had to do with graphic design by other friends, teachers from different school boards, and family, I genuinely could not come up with a proper answer. This program could be improved in so many different ways that are such an easy fix, as a large plethora of the traditional art assignments could be taught digitally and both save time, resources, and could actually potentially be used on a portfolio. The excuse of learning to run before you walk does not apply here, as you can learn to walk DIGITALLY with art as that's what is done in industry. Almost all 1st semester projects could be converted to this and even some assignments ASK YOU TO DO THEM DIGITALLY and then convert them to traditional so saying they can't be converted is a poor excuse. I'm not going to bother going into the issues regarding professors handling of covid with this course as the whole \"Covid makes teaching this hard, it'll be better in person\" Is a tired excuse at this point. They've had a year to adapt their course to this format and at worst it's a lazy excuse, and at best it's incompetence. I genuinely hope in the future that this program is updated, as it feels severely behind in an ever evolving industry, and encourage others to be very wary about going into this course. I wish no Ill Will towards the profs or the students attending, as some are really great profs and nice people. I only make this post in the hopes that they update this course as it severely needs it, so that others can have an enjoyable Fanshawe learning experience like i did in previous programs.",

            "comment": "So I'm just graduating from the Graphic Design program at Fanshawe and while I will agree that a lot of the first year projects seemed useless to me, I had to remember that I was more advanced than most in the program at the time. You get out what you put into this program and while I agree that updating needs to happen, I always took every project as a personal challenge to exceed the profs expectations and create something I was genuinely proud of and could turn into a portfolio piece. \n\nI'm leaving third year with an excellent portfolio, having already interned for Goodwill as a designer, doing contract graphic design work for Fanshawe, and heading into a full time Lead Graphic Designer job with a new company. There were many times I was frustrated with the lack of effort or knowledge some students and even teachers put into the course work, but you really have to focus on yourself and work continuously on making yourself better and looking for opportunity everywhere.",

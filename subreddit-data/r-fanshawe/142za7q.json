    "postText": "I am enrolled in the CPA3 program starting in September. I was curious if anyone has experience with using parallels to run windows on a MacBook. I don't want to have to buy a new laptop if I don't have to and the price of parallels yearly is a lot easier to stomach. If you have used it, is it doable to go through the program with just parallels or will I actually need a windows laptop? I don't mind the minor inconvenience of having to run a program in order to use windows. Thanks in advance.",

There were a handful of students who tried it... most ended up graduating with a PC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nas for parallels, can't give direct input",

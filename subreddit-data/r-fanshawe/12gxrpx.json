    "postText": "I noticed that on webadvisor it says \"Application Incomplete\" for the graphic design program I applied for. I was wondering if that has something to do with one of the admission requirements being \"Completion of Visual Artwork and Written Response\" ? I couldn't find any information about how to submit that? I also have an offer for a different program so I don't think it has anything to do with transcripts. Anyone know what this means?",

    "postText": "Honestly thought going into my program for fall wasn\u2019t going to be terrible, but I was wrong. I moved away from my home more than 5 hours from here and wish I\u2019d just kept working till in person returned. I was stuck in a dilemma between working or going to college. Sadly its too late to get my money back and I\u2019m already half way into my lease.\n\nI don\u2019t mind most of my profs but theres about 1-2 that are making things difficult to even learn anything. My program is 3 years and If I\u2019m stuck doing online for even my second semester this is going to be tough to tolerate. I constantly feel like I\u2019m stressing even though I\u2019m done all my assignments.\n\nI\u2019d even heard things warning about this program and I\u2019m kinda wishing I\u2019d listened. Maybe I\u2019m just having a breakdown and I\u2019m homesick since I\u2019m only 18. Also I\u2019m not sure even how many people pass/drop this program. If anyone is curious I\u2019m in the CYB program.",

            "comment": "CYB has one of the highest drop out/fail rates. It looks like this program will not go back to fully in person anytime soon. Most instructors you have after semester 2 are part time and only available after 5pm so your classes are online. If you\u2019re struggling with content reach out to peer tutoring, $5 per hour, contracts are 5 hours long. I am finishing the program so if there is a specific course you are struggling with it\u2019s okay to ask. Also, don\u2019t take your first tests to heart. Every intake for the first three years seems to average around 50% on their first midterms. If you have questions about specific staff or classes that you need help staying engaged in, you can also ask that.",

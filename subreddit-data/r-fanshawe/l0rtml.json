But with 5 live sessions per minute i can see why some people might be less inclined, maybe she doesn\u2019t know how to expand and is now getting a hang of the software, when its that long a paragraph i would suggest that we talk on the phone so you can better explain to me. But dont knock her so hard for this haha...\n\ncheers\n\n\nEdit:\n\nYour first problem is that your priority button needs to be toggled in the current set up, your new mails are going to the bottom of your inbox or whereever they feel like this is the small button with the circle and a (i), click that till you see the new stuff at the top.\n\n\nIn the settings you can turn off the preview pane option giving you better use of the screen real estate.\n\n\nWhen launching links from the message body ctrl+click or right click open in new tab, you do it in ms word hyper links, you do in outlook exchange email apps and unfortunately you need to do it in FOL as well.",

    "postText": "Update to anyone who looks up this same info: I got my course dropped! Looking at webadvisor I don't see an academic penalty even though I've dropped this right at midterms!\n\npreviously completed a program at western university and now doing one at Fanshawe (both programs unrelated) taking an elective course now and I just had a thought if the electives in my  last program counted to this program. \n\nCan it be any elective from this last program? It was taken from 2015-2019. I know it's passed the course deadline, but this elective I'm taking now has such a heavy course load that it's affecting my courses that actually matter and I would rather drop it and take the withdrawn on my grades but get the credit instead of BSing thru it. \n\nContacted my academic advisor, who forwarded me to gened email but im asking in the mean time in case someone has gone thru this already.",

Mine were I think around 2017-2018 ish, and they accepted both courses (my program required 2 gen ed electives). I didn't have any issues here.\n\nI'm *not* sure how it works for you since you're past the drop date and I dropped before the term started, but I think they were pretty fast to get back to me and yeah, better to take the W and focus on the courses that really matter.",

I\u2019m sure the application form is online. I would submit asap, so that you can withdraw from your current course before the 70% withdrawal deadline. After that deadline you get whatever grade you get in the course. Withdrawal before the 70% deadline and the course will show a W as the grade on your transcript.",

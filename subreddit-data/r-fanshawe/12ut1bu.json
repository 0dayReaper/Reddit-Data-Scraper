    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m a 105 coming from general arts and science and I\u2019m trying to get an idea if I have a chance for fanshawe and western sites for nursing. I have a projected 4.04 overall GPA for both semesters (still waiting on one test mark so might drop to a 4.02 but I don\u2019t think it will) and 4th quartile casper. Additionally, can anyone from previous years who was admitted share their average GPA if you took pre-health or general arts &amp; science?",

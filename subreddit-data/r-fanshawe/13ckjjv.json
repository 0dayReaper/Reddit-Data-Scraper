            "comment": "If you pay via Visa or MasterCard through WebAdvisor, the transaction is pretty fast. If you pay through your bank, expect it to be a few business days before Fanshawe registers the payment and reflects on WebAdvisor.  \n\n\nThen again, it all depends on your situation and your bank. If nothing changes within a 2-5 business days, contact the college.",

Perhaps it simply hasn\u2019t updated yet? Did you try speaking to anyone that would know like the financial office? Sorry I can\u2019t be of more help but this is really something random strangers won\u2019t typically know the answer to. You need to contact someone at Fanshawe.",

First I would recommend you to go to the registrar office in campus and book an appointment with them and explain the situation to them :) they will for sure help you. And I'm saying once again if the payment has gone through from your side, don't worry as the money won't be going anywhere else\n\nAlso I wanted to ask, is the amount payable starting with minus ( - )",

Anyway I would highly recommend you to please reach out to registrars office for detailed info.It is better to be safe than sorry ;)",

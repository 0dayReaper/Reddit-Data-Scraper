    "postText": "Hello, I am currently studying film and television at Sheridan College, but lately, I have been wondering about studying music instead, as it has been a very big passion of mine for a while now. I am really into writing and performing, and would really like to get into the production side of music as well. I was wondering if anyone currently taking the program would recommend it to those who would be interested.",

The best part of that course is the connections you will make. Meet everyone, play on everyone's projects and take full advantage of the awesome studio gear you will have access to.\n\nI also took Audio Post-Production (optional 3rd year) and it was also fantastic.\n\nI 100% recommend but it is not a necessity to be successful in the music industry.",

However if you are looking to specialize in one role and only want to pursue that there are more focused programs available.",

I\u2019ve worked with a few musicians\ud83e\udd23\nThe top schools for learning music seem to be Fanshawe and Humber. Both have produced some of my favorite musicians. Times have changed and the money musicians stand to make now is lower and lower. \nIf you want to go to school, let me suggest arts admin of some type. \nThis type of job is usually full time, day work, benefits yada yada. Performers come and go, paperwork is forever. \nThen take your mad chops out to the bar at night and slay the stage \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\nAll the best on your journey.",

    "postText": "Starting or returning to college can be really exciting, it\u2019s even more exciting this year because school has looked so different during the pandemic and we can finally connect with each other in person. \n\nFanshawe wants you to have an amazing experience, meet lots of people and create so many memories! \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind as you make the most of your college experience:\n\n\\- Party smart to keep you and your credential safe (Student Code of Conduct)\n\n\\- Ask first, consent is an ongoing conversation \n\n\\- Be mindful of your neighbours\n\n\\- Count your drinks, alternate between alcohol and water\u00a0\n\nRemember that Fanshawe is in a residential community with many families nearby. Be respectful of our neighbours and community. If you can go out with others, a buddy system is always a good idea. Plan a safe way home in advance and\u00a0take care of your fellow falcons. See something, say something.\u00a0",

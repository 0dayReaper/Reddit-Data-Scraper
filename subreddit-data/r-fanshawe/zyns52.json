I\u2019m a 25yo construction worker thinking  of going back to college to take this program, but I\u2019m concerned it may be way over my head as I have no prior knowledge or experience in this field. I\u2019d like to know from the guys who\u2019ve taken it, is this program geared towards utter novices as they say or some prior experience is required? Thanks",

If you don't know a thing about programming though, I would recommend doing some sort of quick basic practice course, to see if it's something that interests you / makes sense to you. I've seen a lot of people struggle because their brains just aren't wired for that kind of work. Just to make sure it's something you can and would want to do, before you commit to a 3 year program.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

            "comment": "I 100% agree with the other comment. I was enrolled to start the course, and I did a lot of coding on my free time. Before I started and payed the fees, I found out that I absolutely could not code for longer than two hours. My brain would shut down and refuse to look up new information (there\u2019s a joke about programmers about being called \u201cprofessional googlers\u201d because you google all. the. time.)\n\nIf you like maths and studying, I think it\u2019s a great career. That being said, a college course in computer programming is less likely to get you a job than a degree, which is what most of your peers would achieve. After you complete the college portion, I would recommend transferring to Western afterwards to complete your degree. They make you take a two year course- resulting in 5 years of school together",

            "comment": "I recently graduated the course after going into it without any prior experience coding (also after a career change in a completely unrelated field).\n\nIt starts off fairly basic with the fundamentals and builds from there in later semesters, although there is a noticeable jump in difficulty from semester 3 onwards. You will need good time management skills and study habits to succeed as the workload can be quite daunting at times. \n\nI'd recommend downloading a compiler and working through a beginner tutorial or two off YouTube to see if you have any interest or enjoyment doing programming. I was lucky that despite going in blind I ended up really falling in love with programming as a whole, but not everyone will have this experience. \n\nIt's quite the journey overall if you decide to take the course, but it's worth it if you stick with it.",

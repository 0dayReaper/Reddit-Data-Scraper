    "postText": "I\u2019ve been accepted to Fanshawe for Fall 2023 and really want to go there. I will be an international student moving from the US to Canada to attend but I\u2019m having trouble finding a loan provider because I won\u2019t be able to pay for it all out of pocket. Do any international students have recommendations for a loan provider? I wouldn\u2019t be able to go with most Canadian sources because I don\u2019t have a co-signer within Canada.",

I did a bit of research and found an article for you ^^ there are many options available for international students but the only thing is they jacked up the tuition for you guys a lot :/ kinda assuming y\u2019all are well off but thats really not the case. Canada is actually way more expensive than the states. \n\nhttps://www.internationalstudent.com/study_canada/financial_aid/\n\nYou can also go to the government of Canada website :) it\u2019s pretty simple to navigate so don\u2019t worry. You can also call fanshawes financial aid office and ask about what options they have for students in your situation, they\u2019ll help you out :)\n\nI\u2019m a local so I\u2019m not really familiar with having to go through your situation but I wanted to help the best I can.",

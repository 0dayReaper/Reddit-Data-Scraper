After talking to a couple hygienist I knew it would be a good fit, but so difficult to get into! Can\u2019t wait to start in the fall it\u2019s a small class so if you go with dental I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll run into each other :) congrats",

I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you this fall, and good luck with your studies! :)",

You are currently in Awaiting Gridding status pending receipt of all applications for this program for Jan. Those who scored highest on their supplementals are given the seats. VGD2 has not been gridded for the past 2 or 3 intakes. Thanks!\"  \n\n\nWhat does this mean?",

If there are more applicants than spots when applications close, applicants will be ranked in some form and the top people will get the spot, otherwise everyone will get in.\n\nOh and the last bit is saying they've not had more applications than spots the last few admission periods.",

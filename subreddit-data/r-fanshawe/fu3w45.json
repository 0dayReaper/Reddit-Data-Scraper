    "postText": "Started my program literally the same semester as the strike a few years back - essentially fucking up my classes for the first 2 or 3 semesters.\n\nNow we are finally past that and were on a more normal schedule, then this pandemic happens and fucks it all up once again - forcing whats essentially a glorified networking course to be done completely online, defeating 1/2 the purpose.\n\nFurthermore, on my 5th out of 6 semesters, my program has now hired 2 foreign teachers that A) have never taught a class before and B) have such thick accents that I cant understand what they say.\n\nNow that we are on the latter half of the program, I feel as if the effort put into it has significantly decreased. The program coordinator hasn't taught any of the programs later than the 3rd semester, similarly we haven't used the \"million dollar\" server room in multiple semesters, opting to simulate networks on our laptops using Virtual images instead.\n\nDid you know if you have OSAP and drop out before completing your course, all of your grants become loans? Meaning once you are half way thro a program, its actually cheaper for you to finish the program than to drop out. Based on my experience, Fanshawe is well aware of this and takes advantage of it liberally.\n\nThats just some of the dysfunction of the school as a whole - as for the classwork? Its essentially useless.\n\nMultiple course assignments have been outsourced to a company that provides labs and automatically marks the submissions. Overall wouldnt be the worst if students werent expected to pay for it ON TOP of the school Tuition. Im not exactly sure why Im giving the school $500+ per course, when I have to pay another company 200$ in order to get 30% of the marks in said course.\n\nSince the very beginning our coordinator has bragged about the 'hundreds' of coop opportunities available for this course, which is just a straight up lie. Each COOP semester there has been about 20 placements posted - all of which we competed for with the Programming and Networking students, meaning there are about 20 placements for a few hundred people. Not to mention the fact that over 1/2 of them are stationed in Toronto. And make no mistake, the Programming COOPs are not offered to the Cyber Security students, because our program has effectively 0 programming in it.\n\nBasically, if you are interested in Cyber Security, save yourself from going over 10k in debt, and just go pay for some Cyber Security certificates (CEP, CISSP and CISM to name a few) - Considering our program coordinator has recommended will still get those certifications anyway, kinda points out the uselessness of their own program.\n\nTL;DR - Fanshawe is a Business first, and an Educational Institution second.",

I guess is true when people say that Fanshawe is a great school for health, arts and some business, but RUN from IT, apprenticeships and pretty much all co-op programs. I always see people ranting about co-op.",

I don't know anything about the new teachers. However it's still a new program and they only have three permanent full-time CYB teachers. In conversations I have heard that the college is only hiring Professors as full time now, meaning that they must have their PhD or be seeking it out and hold their Masters. Co-op problems don't surprise me. Seems pretty normal in my experience with University of Waterloo that all programs in the faculty apply to the same programs.",

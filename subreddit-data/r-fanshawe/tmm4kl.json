    "postText": "Hey I guess this is a mini rant but a question. Has anyone else noticed the lack of supports this semester? I know we\u2019re recovering from heavy lockdowns but I\u2019ve noticed (even during the mess last year was) bursary funds used to get sent out in the middle of the semester. Now they send approvals near the end of the semester, not even the funds. I\u2019ve also been deterred from using testing centres, and counselling past 5 sessions. I\u2019m just not getting it, if \u201cFanshawe Cares\u201d why isn\u2019t getting back to supporting students top priority. I know other institutions offer students less, but I\u2019m not here to defend the bare minimum. I just want to hear any other student experiences with on campus/ online supports. I haven\u2019t even dissected the lacking International students supports. Anyways, cheers.",

There is one called UWO off-campus housing and roommates wanted UWO, for Western University; you might find some options in these groups,  and I imagine there will be similar groups for Fanshawe too. Other places to look could be Kijiji, FB marketplace, and UWO off campus accommodation website, or Fanshawe website for other links.",

They help out other programs with photoshoots, do some pretty professional work and I know their cameras are pretty awesome.\n\nWhen I was studying in another media program I got to use some of the general use ones like the Nikon 7200 and 7500. They have a good selection of Canon, and Sony cameras too.\n\nI think the Film program and photography program have their own specialized cameras for use in the program as well. I got a Linkedin photo from them once.",

Some programs can be completely full-time online (for domestic students only though), some are just limited to part-time status. \n\nTypically, if you really want to finish faster, you're better off taking the full-time in-person over the online. For my program (OAM4) many people started out as online but transitioned to in-person because it can be SUPER difficult to get any help if you need it. \n\nWhen you sign up for online studies, you are signing up for essentially an independent study course and will get some help, but not to the extent of what would be offered for a full-time, in-person student.",

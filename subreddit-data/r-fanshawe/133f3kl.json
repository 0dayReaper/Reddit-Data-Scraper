I will most likely accept the offer but I had a few questions.\n1.Are the courses that are required really difficult?\n2.How is the learning environment in the classes?\n3.I saw the required courses ranging from group 1 to 10. Can someone explain how the course selection works and how many credits are required to receive the BA degree?\n\nThanks!",

First off congratulations on your acceptance.   \nAs with almost any program there will be some courses more challenging than others, but we have great learning supports if you find you need some extra help.   \n\n\nThe program is hybrid, with some classes in person and some online. Classes are a decent size, but not too big. There is a chance to interact with other students and professors typically.   \n\n\nOk so your courses can be found here: [https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/bca1-honours-bachelor-commerce-accounting/courses-next](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/bca1-honours-bachelor-commerce-accounting/courses-next)  \n\n\nSo for level you take all of the mandatory core courses, which is five courses  \n\n\nLevel 2 take all of the mandatory core courses + mandatory non-core courses - for six courses total. \n\nLevel 3 take all of the mandatory core courses (3) + mandatory non-core courses (2) + one general elective   \n\n\nLevel 4 take all of the mandatory core courses (4) + general electives (1 to 2)  \n\n\nLevel 5 take all of the mandatory core courses (3) + general electives (1 to 2)  \n\n\nLevel 6 take all of the mandatory core courses (5) + general electives (1)  \n\n\nLevel 7 take all of the mandatory core courses (3) + additional requirement (2) + general elective (1)  \n\n\nLevel 8 take all of the mandatory core courses (6)  \n\n\nOne co-op term of 4 to 8 months required   \n\n\nYou will automatically be registered for fall of your mandatory courses (core and non-core), you will register for your electives ahead of the term you need them in. You will receive instructions on how to do this.   \n\n\nYou must complete all of this to receive your degree.",

I have absolutely no idea about programming and networking, can I get through it?",

You will set up networks and secure them from exploits, or find vulnerabilities.\n\nThere is some other stuff, like auditing and ethics, but if networking is something you'd like to avoid, this prly isn't the one for you",

Having classmates/friends to help with problems is super helpful",

Networking, same thing, it\u2019s just a very intense topic and makes up 50% of the program really cause without the internet 80% of attacks would be mitigated.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a student at Fanshawe who is disabled and neurodivergent. I know I'm not the only student who has noticed gaps in accessibility and general opportunities to connect in an accessible manor on campus. I was thinking about forming a Disabled Students Association as a space for us to connect with peers like us socially, as well as a space to discuss accessibility issues and possibly work towards having them addressed. Let me know if you'd be interested in this. I'd especially like to hear from fellow disabled students.",

I also didn't notice anyone using a mobility aid of sorts while we were there.  I won't be going to this school at this time, but def this is great. Current and future generations will thank you",

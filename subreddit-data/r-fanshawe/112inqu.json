The work itself is not too bad. \n\nThere's a few classes like Mike Roth's class with video quizzes you can finish all at once at the beginning of the semester, your Pro Tools class you can probably read through the AVID Learning pretty quickly, do the exercises and take notes afterwards to save you some time.\n\nYou'll find many of your classmates supportive of you and helpful in keeping track of assignments. I certainly had that experience in first year.",

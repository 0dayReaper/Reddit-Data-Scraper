We've emailed our teacher asking about these lost marks saying the rubric he provided stated overwise and the he told us \"It was an old rubric\". Now that many people have emailed him, hes changed the file on FOL to reflect how he is marking and is directing people to look at this new file to why they lost marks. How is this ok?",

    "postText": "So, I have never moved away for school so some of these questions are the web page didn\u2019t specify / specify clearly to me &amp; some of these are general \u201coh my god I\u2019m adulting what do I do\u201d questions. (do not feel obligated to answer every single one, although I\u2019d appreciate if you can be as informative as possible!) \n\n-laundry; I plan to live in the townhouses; is there a laundry unit in the townhouses? Or do I have to walk/drive somewhere to do it. &amp; I assume you\u2019d hv to pay to use them. What would that fee look like? A couple dollars at a time, paid for within the amount I pay in housing fees etc \n\n-guests; If the rest of my roommates are cool with it, can I have friends over? Is there a curfew for them to leave? Can I hv \u201csleep overs\u201d with friends occasionally \n\n-common area; how do people go about these spaces. Do people write their names on all their groceries, do people share things like utensils? I genuinely don\u2019t know what\u2019s socially acceptable here. Bc I can totally see everyone be like \u201cthis is mine don\u2019t touch it\u201d but I also see everyone as \u201cwe\u2019re all broke let\u2019s work together on costs for common spaces\u201d \n\n-parking; so I do drive, would I hv to pay for parking in residence? Or is it included? I assume I\u2019d hv to pay campus parking if I were to drive the 2 min to park by my class but how about to park by my house? Since I didn\u2019t see any driveways in the images on the web-sight\n\n-wifi; on the we sight it  says wifi is free; would there be a book inside the house to tell us how to connect to it? \n\n-housekeeping; so I assume now and then a staff member comes in to ensure we are following the rules like no smoking, no candles etc. But do they also do any house keeping like garbages? And if not... where do I go to take out the trash \n\n-security; so on the websight it mentioned security for the apartment style housing but not the townhouses, what type of security is to be expected? \n\n-key swipe entry to house/bedroom; I assume I\u2019m assigned a bedroom &amp; that bedroom only unlocks with my key swipe. But do I always need that on me? If I leave my bedroom and close the door am I locked out of my bedroom with out that key? \nAs for the house I assume everyone who\u2019s assigned to live there, lives there with their key entry \n\n-essentials; aside from things like pots, pans, shower curtains, cutting boards. Etc is there anything else that I should bring to make living both easier &amp; feel more at home?",

            "comment": "Hi there id like to answer a few of the questions and hope to help! I do live in the townhouses so these answers are based on that. \n\n- laundry : yes there is a laundry room although it is in the first row so if you live farther to the back it is a little bit of hike. You receive a laundry card on your day of arrival that you fill up with a machine in the laundry room it is about 2 dollars for wash and dry i believe. \n\n- guests : yes of course you can friends over you would usually just talk it over quickly with your roommates but unless they are terrible it should be fine (it is your house as well). I don\u2019t believe there is any curfew for guests as well. Technically you are supposed to sign in any guests although we don\u2019t really do that much in kestrel but possibly in later years they might become more strict with it \n\n- common area : this will probably depend on your roommates and their beliefs. For example in my house we share utensils and appliances pretty freely. We sometimes share food and what not but usually we just eat our own. \n\n- parking : yes you do need to pay for parking for residence there is a parking lottery you\u2019ll need to apply to for a chance of getting a spot. It\u2019s about 300 something it\u2019s pretty pricy. In the townhouse there are parking spots around the court but they are not assigned so sometimes you might need to park a bit far from the house. \n\n- wifi ; yes on the day of arrival one of the many information papers they give you are how to join the website. It is a bit confusing how to join it I still haven\u2019t fully figured it out but you can call the company who runs the wifi company and they are pretty helpful. Once you\u2019re connected it\u2019s not too confusing after that.\n\n- housekeeping : i\u2019m not sure how often the staff comes around to check the house if i\u2019m remembering correctly the first \u201ccheck\u201d we have had was during the winter break while the students were supposed to be gone. There are big dumpsters around the complex i think there are 2 it\u2019s just a short walk away not too bad. \n\n- security : I haven\u2019t had too much experience with security too far they are often driving around the complex making sure nothing looks suspicious or out of hand. We also have one of the \u201cpole\u201d things in the complex that you can press that will alert security people to come to that spot right away. Every once in awhile a security guard will be out front checking cards making sure everyone coming in is safe and meant to be there (doesn\u2019t happen too often mostly when but events are going on). They are always on call and there are phone numbers that you can call to talk to them if needed.\n\n- key cards : yes you\u2019ll always need your key card on you. Once you close your door without the card you\u2019ll need to go to the front desk for a temporary lockout card. If you do loose it completely i think it\u2019s 25 dollars for a replacement. Yes only you and your roommates can get into your house and individual rooms.\n\n- Here are a few things i\u2019ve enjoyed having with me but i\u2019m sure there are a few more i can think of right now \n* air fryer (not really an essential but making cooking so much easier) \n* there is a tv in the house but you\u2019ll need some device to connect to it ( firestick Roku etc.)\n* an extension cord\n\nI really hope this helped but please let me know if you have any more questions or want to see pictures or anything at all!",

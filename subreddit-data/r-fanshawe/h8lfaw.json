    "postText": "With pretty much everything opening up by end of month, I am really hoping fanshawe goes back on this online shit. I am part of the experimental online phase right now with summer school and i can attest its been absolute dog shit.\nMe and majority of my classmates are going back and forth with ombudsmen, coordinators and associate deans due to the lack of transparency and lack of professors caring.\n\nI can write of list of how bad it has been, but it would take me too long.\n\nEdit: 1 more thing to add, I get my class can be \"taught\" online because its computer programming, but the only reason me and many other students attended school is due to lack of motivation and concentration when it comes to studying at home. Not to mention all the free resources that teach better than these \"professors\"... Not to mention taking a semester off is not possible with this program at fanshawe...",

I ended up dropping out completely this month because I couldn't concentrate at home like you said, took a $2000 loss on tuition but I think it was worth it. Out until January 2021 now. Online classes have been an absolute crap show in my program imo.",

It has to be some business experiment to see if people are willing to do that &gt;.&gt; In my program (and ive warned everyone coming into first year) my c++ professor did not post a video for a solid month or slides even, posted a project and a quiz, then quit. I even have the email of the coordinator rushing to look for another prof. This other prof takes over and is trying to hold 6 hour zoom lectures every week on thursday. Mess me with that shit lol",

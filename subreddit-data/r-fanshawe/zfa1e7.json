In the last few years, I used my transcript to apply to (successfully) to the Engineering program at UWO.  \n\n\nFrom what I recall, pre-health is a general mix of anat, bio, chem, physics...I'm sure there have been some changes since I took it. I found it more challenging than any of the material in nursing. I can't really compare it to 1st year eng because I had to withdraw relatively early for financial reasons.",

You can take an assessment, that if you pass, gets you your writ credit for first term, lightening the heavy workload a little.   \nI studied a lot, but also had very little science background, and got into collaborative nursing this way.   \nIf you're ready to work hard, which healthcare programs also require, it is manageable.",

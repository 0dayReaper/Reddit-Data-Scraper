    "postText": "Hey guys, I have a question about academic offences.\n\nSo recently in one of my courses we had to do any essay worth around 20%. My prof told everyone that if the essay was flagged for plagiarism even if it was accidental we would get an academic offence.\n\nObviously my essay was flagged for accidental plagiarism. My fault because I decided to do my essay at the last minute and rushed it. The prof gave my essay a zero and said \u201cYou will receive an academic offence form in your permanent college file.\u201d\n\nI honestly am scared right now. What\u2019s going to happen to me now? This is my first time getting an offence. I was planning on apply for a transfer to a different institution next year but now I got this on my record.\n\nEdit: my prof emailed me back and she was very sweet about the whole thing but she will send me a copy of my offence form.",

            "comment": "If your reasoning is true and all you did was poorly paraphrase a source you can probably work it out with your proff or the faculty.  In my experience though academic offences are generally only ever used if blatant and obvious cheating is detected, hopefully for your sake you aren't trying to make whatever happened appear like less of an issue than it actually was.  \n\nPersonally this post seems similar to the cries for help of students that used ChatGPT for last minute essays and got caught.",

Like mentioned in my post the prof said plagiarism even if accidental will automatically get you an academic offence. I\u2019m just asking what should I expect from this since I\u2019ve never got one before",

You'll just have to be extra careful about future assignments.  Personally I'd try to fight it as a poorly written paraphrasing and appeal to their sensibilities as an honest mistake but it's up to you.  Depending on the program you're taking they may be harsher on research/writing based mistakes or more lenient.",

Aside the immediate fail on the course and awkward relationship with the instructor, there wasn\u2019t much long term impact. I could appeal for it to be removed sooner but it was nbd since I wasn\u2019t having other schools pull my academic record afterwards, so it just died organically.

            "comment": "Pro tip: On the professor side of things, catching a student for academic misconduct is a *huge pain in the ass*. I really cannot emphasize enough how much work it creates for the professor. You have to send so many emails to the Undergrad Chair and the Academic Integrity Office and so on. And then the student probably appeals, so you have to write a little report detailing what they submitted and when, and make a little dossier of emails, and it's just so much unnecessary work and a big waste of time. Your prof has got about twenty things they would rather be doing, from writing their own papers down to sitting on a grad committee or reading someone's dissertation, and taking care of your plagiarism case probably eats into their free time. The frustrating thing about it is that it could have all been avoided if the student had just spent twenty minutes writing a proper citation in APA style or whatever. I wish more students understood that, yeah, your profs care about academic integrity and everything, but it's usually not a case where it's about the principle of the thing -- they just really don't want the obligation that is created when someone decides to fuck around and find out. \n\nAnd before *anyone* ***dares*** to suggest that this means the prof might let it slide: nuh-uh, shut that shit down right away. Do not insult your professor's intelligence by thinking you have any leverage whatsoever. The best thing to do (aside from doing a good job to start with) is to cite your sources properly, turn in a sloppy essay that earns you a C+ or whatever, and don't get slammed with a zero in the course. In your case, you did the right thing by admitting guilt and making it easy on the prof. That's going to win you more mercy than obligating them to do extra work just to bring the hammer down on you, because any time someone is obviously in the wrong and decides to fight it anyways, you better believe that inspires the prof to try *extra hard* to nail that person's ass to the wall. If I have to cancel social plans to burn someone who *raised an appeal despite provable guilt*, there's going to be nothing left but ash and bones.",

You said it...you're only on day 2 of your classes. Give yourself a break! You're coming into a brand new school year, online, during a pandemic!  \nMy advice to you is to reach out to your professors. I would hope that they would be able to ease your worries and guide you through.  \nTrust me when I say, if you're asking a question about something, chances are you are NOT the only one.   \nIt's hard not to feel defeated and I totally get that. For me, teaching online means not being able to see my students in person and it's awful. Ask your peers, and ask your professors. That's what we're here for. I'd much rather students reach out than suffer in silence.   \nAlso, there's external help for students through Fanshawe. Don't be afraid to use them. From peer tutoring to counselling, they are there to help you.  \n[https://www.fanshawec.ca/student-life/student-services/counselling-services](https://www.fanshawec.ca/student-life/student-services/counselling-services)  \nYou got this. You ALL got this. :)  \n\n\n\\-Tammy",

Before covid, took an online class for gen ed, my professor emails me back after the due date of the first assignment when I asked her a question about the assignment. Im an alumni but im curious if fanshawe has services to support online classes, if so, maybe look into it. Other than that, I understand how you feel, I decided to drop out my online gen ed then took an in-class gen ed next semester because I couldn't sit and read at my computer, especially at home, its hard. I learned doing homework at school or outside of my room was a bit better to get things done.",

Sessions can be recorded by the prof for review as well! Request this if your prof is not doing the same. Good luck. It's going to take a lot is self discipline... everyone including myself is nervous, but really try to make the most of your on campus clinics.",

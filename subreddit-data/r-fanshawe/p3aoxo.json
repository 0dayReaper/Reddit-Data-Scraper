Wanted to go back to college for something that will actually give me a decent job once I'm done lol. Are the job prospects good? How's the course? and was the co op any good or worth it? \n\nThanks all",

I guess I was lucky, I've done all 3 of my co-ops at the same place, and will likely work part time for them while in school this fall. \n\nMature students might have a /slight/ advantage in that we're house broken so to speak. We usually know how to do a job. Even though Fanshawe had like 3 courses in CPA that teach you those skills, some people just don't know how to behave in a workplace.\n\nThe value of your co-op can vary wildly. I know some people who did squat all term on their co-op. Again maybe I was lucky, because I get to trouble shoot real problems and write code that goes to production.",

Not everyone who does program has this experience. From that I've seen and heard, the majority of graduates either struggle to find a job or are being very underpaid.",

Most of the professors are great, I get along well with the students, and so far the workload hasn't been too bad, although from upper year students I have heard that the difficulty ramps up hard in the 3rd semester. The course was recommended to me from graduates that have nothing but positive things to say about it. If you can manage to get into a coop (they are very competitive, not everybody can get one) it's great, helps you learn a lot, plus you get paid pretty decently during it, and it gives valuable work experience. As with pretty much anything in the tech field at the moment, the job prospects are quite good.\n\nBill Pulling, who teaches first and second semester java, is one of my favourite people on the planet. He's great with beginner programmers.",

Most of the profs are responsive in terms of help. Coops are difficult to get too. It\u2019s best to look for ones outside of the college, on your own time, instead of the job board. Very few are posted. \n\nI\u2019m in my last semester in September and have not been able to get any of their coops, even with interviews. You can still graduate without it. \n\nHonestly, job-wise you can do anything remote. But most of the jobs are NOT local to London. Even 90% of the coops were not for London. Figure out a job you want to do as a coder first and make sure there\u2019s at least 1 course in CPA for it. \n\nAnother thing to note is a lot of people who jump into it blindly end up dropping because they realized it wasn\u2019t just making games\u2026\n\nAll the best!",

            "comment": "I graduated from CPA2 at 27, I did not do the co-ops there as I had an arrangement with my pre-college employer that kept me on part time during my classroom terms so I would work full time in my off terms.  After graduating, I had some difficulty getting a job anywhere, nobody wanted to hire me without any professional experience.  \n\nI then went on to do Computer Application Security at Conestoga, which I did almost entirely for the chance at getting a co-op.  I did a co-op on the end of that and got hired on full time by that employer after I finished the co-op term.  \n\nSince then I've taken a different job with a university and overall my experience has been excellent. My current employer has 3 Fanshawe CPA grads in our department, one brand new and seems promising, the other one I work closely with and I find her to be one of the most capable developers I've ever worked with.  \n\nAs far as a career to have in the pandemic, I doubt there's anything better, we became more necessary than ever and at the same time our job moved to mostly remote work and that is excellent.  \n\nThe job security is good, I recently was testing the waters looking for jobs as my current employer is trying to get me to come back to work in an office full time and I don't want to do that.  I can happily report that it seems like that won't be a problem.  I did a couple interviews already, got an offer and basically, I'm just going to bite the bullet and go to the office for a couple months until I get a job with a company I really want.",

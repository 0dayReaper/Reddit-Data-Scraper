Is the \"Completion of Visual Artwork and Written Response\" a requirement for all of the pre requisites or just the last one? Also what does it mean? (Like what would I submit with that) I applied already but it never asked me to submit anything so idk if I did things right or not.\n\nThese are the requirements:\nhttps://ibb.co/vjwYQxt",

            "comment": "The first two prerequisites listed there are standard if you graduated from high school in Ontario and got your diploma, so that would automatically qualify you alone. In grade 12, you can take either college or uni level english which were called applied and academic. By submitting your grade 12 transcript to the college, via the Ontario colleges website, they\u2019ll see that you\u2019ve either taken college or uni English :) \n\nFor the visual artwork and written part I honestly just grabbed some artwork I\u2019ve been working on, one digital and one traditional, it can also be any painting or drawing. I think any logo work or typography can be valid too but I just took the safe route in choosing two artworks that were different media. It helps if you\u2019ve kept art from art class in grade 11 or 12 or if you\u2019re like me, do artwork as a hobby for Instagram and personal portfolio which you can just scan to your computer/take a pic on your phone and upload it. \n\nAnd then for personal prep you\u2019ll be fine if you\u2019re familiar with design and art concepts like the basic stuff, line, shape, form, colour, texture value and space. If you were in yearbook that\u2019s great too although it isn\u2019t necessary since I bet they\u2019ll be teaching us all from the bottom. \n\nGood luck! I\u2019m also starting in the same program \ud83e\udee1",

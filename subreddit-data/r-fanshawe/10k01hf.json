    "postText": "Hi guys. I'm a mature student applicant, and will be 25 for the 2023/2024 school year. I am wondering if it's normal for mature students to live in residence. For any current students living in residence, do you know of any older students on your floor? I'm just trying to figure out my living situation for next year.\n\nThanks so much in advance.",

That was my experience on res (not Fanshawe) at 18 and it was ok but the guys on my floor got pretty rowdy sometimes like breaking TV\u2019s\u2026 also communal bathrooms and roommates can be a pain. Im 23 now and would never live on res again, im past my party stage and too mature now. It\u2019s also not any cheaper than renting a room in a house so I\u2019d recommend doing that. Less people, less noise, minimal parties",

It was on my mind at first that I would be \"older\" than everyone, and I was worried at first, but that was very short lived. It wasn't a problem at all. I made some good friends that I still have.\n\nLike anywhere, age doesn't really matter. It's how you mesh with people. There will be some who are more \"mature\" than you are, yet younger than you, and there are some who are the complete opposite. I'd say you have less to worry about than you think.",

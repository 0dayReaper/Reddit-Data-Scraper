Just wanted to say good for you for returning to school later in life and with two kids. That's very daunting. I was also a \"mature\" student, and think I got much more out of the program than if I were right out of high school.",

It is best to check with the program coordinator or academic advisor to get accurate and up-to-date information on the program\u2019s class schedule.  \n\nIn general, part-time students usually take fewer courses per semester than full-time students. Part-time RPN programs typically include both theory and clinical courses and may have a mix of both in your weekly schedule. \n\nYou can expect to spend around 15-20 hours per week in class and additional time outside of class studying, doing homework, and preparing for clinical experiences. Clinical experiences may be scheduled during the day or evening, so some programs require students to complete weekend or overnight shifts. \n\nIt is also important to note that balancing work, family, and school can be challenging, so it is essential to prioritize your time and manage your schedule carefully. Consider discussing your schedule with your employer and family members to ensure you have the support you need to be successful in the program. \n\nBest of luck with your studies!! \ud83c\udf89",

I originally applied to western site along with nursing schools at TMU, and York but heard back from none for a while. I got accepted into the Fanshawe site instead and it took until may to hear back. My average in twelve grade was an 88 but my mid terms was an 86, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get accepted!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am starting my first year of Computer Programming and Analysis this fall but I am worried it is going to be more challenging than I am prepared for. Does anyone have any first year textbook PDFs I could look over to better prepare myself for the upcoming semester. Specifically looking for books relating to these courses:\n\nINFO-1214 Programming Fundamentals  \n\nMATH-1202 Mathematics for Programmers \n\nThanks",

Also when you get started, attend the help sessions, even if you don\u2019t have a question just listen in. For the Math, maybe go online and study some sigma notation and Pearson correlation coefficient. Scrub up on variance and standard deviation, apart from that it\u2019s easy, the Math profs are very good. \n\nGood luck, you\u2019ll do great!.",

Definitely use ChatGPT (a tool I wish I had in my time) to simplify concepts you can\u2019t really grasp. \n\nAlso attend help sessions and ask dumb questions. They\u2019re the best type of questions! Also make sure you stop your professors if they\u2019re going too fast!\n\nWish you the best!",

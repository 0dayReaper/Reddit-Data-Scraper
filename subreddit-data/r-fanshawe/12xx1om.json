    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi :)\n\nI'm a fanshawe student in the supply chain and operation program. I'm in my last year. And after this program I would like to continue my studies with CPA3. I would like to ask a few questions: \n\n1. If you don't have programming knowledge, what tutorials or courses should I take before applying?\n\n2.After finishing the program, do you recommend continuing your studies at the University? What university would you recommend?\n\n3. Is it mandatory to do the co-op or can you complete the program in two years if you do it continuously?\n\n4. Do you recommend making a co-op?\n\n5.What programming languages \u200b\u200bdo you see? which one should I start with?\n\n6. The classes are more practical or more theoretical. I would like to take a more practical program since the supply chain is very theoretical.\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "1. The program is taught assuming you have no programming knowledge. \n2. either option is probably fine. \n3. co-op is optional but its paid so you might as well do it. you dont finish the course faster if you dont do co-op, instead you will just have 4 months off. \n4. yes becuase its paid. \n5. start with Java, and eventually go into c++, c#, javascript. \n6. its a mix of both but the practical parts are more important.",

A quick google of the question literally finds you the answer.\n\nThe issue is when the teachers are simply regurgitating information they don't actually understand. Many teachers are thrown into the program without teaching experience and are given material made entirely by other people; so when you ask them a question they literally can't help.\n\nLet's look at it another way. Would you buy a book from some store if you knew the author gave it away for free at his store?\nIf students knew they could learn the exact same information online, why would they pay for it?\n\nLearn online then just take the test to earn your degree.",

The college preaches integrity for the students and expects zero plagiarism but that should also apply to the teachers.\n\nI am paying for a service, so I expect that service.",

We are paying for a complete course, not repackaged slides from someone else that aren't being properly cited. Also I am working in the industry too, so I don't know what you're talking about. If I copied an entire final product that I was going to give to a client and claim was original work from the company then I would be fired and the company's reputation would be tarnished.\n\nCopying ideas is ok if referenced, take diagrams and citing where they came from is ok, making a final product out of pieces from different sources is ok. Taking an entire lesson from someone else and slapping the Fanshawe logo on it with no other references is not ok. Taking someone else's work and calling it your own and being paid to do that is not ok.",

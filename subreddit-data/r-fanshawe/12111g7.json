    "postText": "Hey thanks for reading this. Okay so. I've heard mixed but mostly negative reviews about fanshawes graphic design program in terms of quality. I am looking for relatively competitive skill training, not something on par with say, a high school level. I apologize for any disrespect this is coming across as. I am basing this on discussions with graduates of the program who are very unsatisfied. I believe Centennial has an online graphic design that could be of option to me, however I am in London so I wanted to try this path first. \n\n\n\nThanks and again I apologize for any disrespect I may have caused.",

We are learning about all the design elements, we are being taught indesign, illustrator, photoshop and XD. Typography is fun we are learning about all the ways different typefaces should be used. There's a couple of boring classes like communications and Co op. And take the writ assessment if you can so you can forgo taking that course cause it's a bitch. First couple of terms are more analog and hands on but that's because it's good to learn the process of how to design and it helps you achieve your own style. Helps spark creativity too. The co op aspect is cool you can work for a summer in the field, get paid, and have that on your diploma and resume by the end of it. It's a great way to make connections. We are also learning web design and photography which are both good skills to become a jack of all trades sorta person. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask!",

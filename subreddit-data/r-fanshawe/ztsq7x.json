    "postText": "Hi guys just wondering what would be a comfortable average required to get into MRT or RT at Fanshawe? I\u2019m currently at a mid 80s average in my Kinesiology program at Western, would this be strong enough? I also got a 90 average in high school in all university level courses! Let me know is that would likely get me into the program.",

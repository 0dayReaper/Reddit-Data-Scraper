I took art through high school which was a few years ago, and I didn\u2019t really learn much about drawing/painting forms, it was kind of just assignment after assignment and teachers would just give us free marks for creativity without teaching us how to draw. Ive been practicing figure drawing on my own for some time now and I\u2019m looking for a more skill based approach that I was lacking before, which is why I chose Fanshawe over western.",

            "comment": "I took the Fine Arts program almost a decade ago but many of the teachers are still there. You'll need to understand that you're going into a program who's purpose is to develop your artistic skills. It isn't like other programs where there is an easy path into the work force after college. When I went, they provided a way to get into Toronto's OCAD at an advance level after finish the program. They do slightly cover signing up to galleries but the focus isn't about making money. The program is about becoming a better artist.\n\nOne of my grips with the program was that they didn't cover technique and instead focused more on theory. At the time, I felt it was a waste but when I graduated I started to appreciate what I learned. I learned things like not focusing on what is there but instead what emotion or feeling the subject evokes. I learned to think outside the box in approach and angle. We had a project in 2nd year where we cut up text and random ranged them into a sentence. It seemed random but it taught us to not just do the same old approaches. The teachers constantly challenged us to not do the same old style that everyone else was doing. I remember we had a classmate who only drew anime and she dropped out because she didn't want to evolve past what she was use to.\n\nFine Arts was also an opportunity to meet other creative people and learn from them and meld their ideas and techniques with my own. If you go into fine Arts thinking you'll only be drawing live subjects or painting hyper realistic landscapes then the program might not be what you're looking for. Fanshawe Fine Arts program is more about expanding your views on art and challenging your previous ideas. We went from almost 60 students in first year to 14 graduating.",

What kind of theory do you learn? Is it more focused on perspective theory and things like constructive anatomy?",

Many of the teachers treated it as a first year and a 3-year program but it is technically a separate Fine Arts foundations class.\n\nFine Arts foundation has a lot more skill lessons when compared to the later years which focus more on theory and why we do things. I don't recall covering perspective or anatomy now that I think about it. Our drawing class, we did live nude drawing but we didn't really focus on the anatomy. The focus was more on working loose and getting a form down quickly. Many of the teachers who work there are more abstract or postmodern artists where form and emotion are more important in the piece than accurate representation of the world",

It seems to me like accuracy in creating forms is an important landmark to master before getting into being provocative and trying to capture emotions over form. I feel like I want to know how to represent forms accurately before working outside of the rules so I can understand when to do it effectively, as all of the great artists learned this way.",

That being said, focusing more on how it visually looks versus whether or not it accurately depicts reality is an important thing. The purpose of art can vary wildly depending on who you ask. I found at fanshawe, the teachers put more emphasis on personal experience and channeling your thoughts through the work instead of focusing on whether or not you could draw a building accurately.\n\nIt might be good to take additional lessons elsewhere if you want to focus on traditional art versus modern art that fanshawe teaches",

    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI recently graduated with a chemistry biochemistry double major and I'm kind of torn between the cannabis applied science programs offered by Loyalist, Lambton, and of course Fanshawe College. Can anyone speak to this program and the Co-Op placements? Also, what do job placements look like after graduating with this certificate?",

            "comment": "Hello to you as well! This is Rykker from the student recruitment team at Fanshawe College. I'm happy to discuss the Cannabis Applied Science program with you and I can connect you with the program's coordinator as well if you'd like.   \nThe greatest feature of this program is probably the amount of time spent in state-of-the-art facilities offered right on campus in the Centre For Applied Research in BioTechnology. These facilities were developed in 2020 and have already been used during preliminary research of covid-19. This space is operated by Fanshawe in conjunction with the federal government, and is a leading research facility for many non-college projects ongoing.\n\nAs far as I am aware, the program does not offer co-op because of the plethora of experience that students will gain in the research labs in their class time. However, the program does boast high job placement. Our students pair their experience in their respective degree with an intensive, career-focused learning environment dedicated to all of the scientific components of the now-legal Cannabis industry, and they find job placement is not difficult post-graduation.\n\nPlease feel free to email me if you have any questions at [R\\_Nyberg@fanshawec.ca](mailto:R_Nyberg@fanshawec.ca)! I understand you may be looking for a student opinion and not a college employee's opinion, and with that I would also recommend visiting us at the Spring Open House on March 25, 2023. Many students and faulty will be present to discuss the program with you there.\n\nCheers!",

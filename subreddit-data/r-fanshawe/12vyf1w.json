One may be more desirable due to the status of job you\u2019d like to have one day, or due to the open vacancies where ever you\u2019d like to work. Hope that helps and if not, I hope you are able to get the answers you\u2019re looking for! Best of luck!",

The profs are great and really want to help you succeed and the classes are really interesting. With respect to RT itself, it's a great career with a lot of job opportunities and a lot of variation in where you can work.",

It definitely is a lot of work , but I feel like if you can do pre health you can do this. A lot of anatomy concepts and managing patients to get them in the right positions.  At the end of the year we did learn the basic concepts of CT, mri, ultrasound ( even though we\u2019ll never do it ) and SPECT and PET",

Wish I had applied for a bachelors in it at McMasters... but cannot go back now lol.  \n\nI like your feedback that profs are great. That also helps alot when faculty is there for you. I heard MRT from fanshawe Is also highly rated? \n\nI think this is also why it's such a hard decision- these weren't my first choice lol but I like to succeed in what I do and do it to the best of my abilities and make a difference in people's life's in whatever career choice I chose.",

    "postText": "I find it strange I can only use Microsoft 365 on my Mac fine with my personal email that\u2019s not connected to Fanshawe yet when I try to do so with my student account it says I can only view the apps and not edit on them? I went to the stay connected site and it does say it won\u2019t work with newer Mac models. My Mac is an older model so I don\u2019t get why it wouldn\u2019t work it also has an intel CPU which if your computer doesn\u2019t have the software won\u2019t work. I\u2019ll try to contact the IT service desk but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be purchasing a windows laptop (that would need updates every second and catch viruses way to easily) just for school when I have a MacBook Pro that works perfectly fine. I hope it\u2019s just an error and I can be granted access. Btw: I can only use the web versions of all the 365 apps.",

After the re-installation activate it by logging in with your fanshawe email.\n\nAlso FYI, windows computers don't \"update every second\" when you purchase a pro license you can manage when updates get installed lol.",

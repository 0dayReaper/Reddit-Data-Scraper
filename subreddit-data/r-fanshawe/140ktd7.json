    "postText": "Hello, I going to be attending Fanshawe in January, and I know that we don't get our schedules until later this fall, I was wondering if anyone knew how many times a week does the Autobody techniques class take place? I'm asking because I live 2 hours away and I was thinking about either driving or renting. Anything helps and thanks in advance:)",

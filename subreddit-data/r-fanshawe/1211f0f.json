Thanks guys \ud83d\ude42",

            "comment": "Happy to answer this for you. In policing, having any university degree or college diploma will do. Particularly in a Canadian/Ontario context, policing recruiters are far more interested in life experience, I.e. job experience, volunteering, physical and mental fortitude, critical KSA\u2019s, involvement in the community etc. \n\nI would always recommend getting a degree or diploma in something unrelated in the event policing isn\u2019t what you think / doesn\u2019t work out, that way you aren\u2019t starting from scratch. \n\nI know a guy who started out as a fish farmer and became a very successful officer with the OPP as well as an editor. You can come from all walks of life, policing is more interested in the caliber of person over a year or two of education which you\u2019ll get at OPC and through training anyways.",

You are better off doing anything else, work in that field while volunteering, and then apply for a job at around 23 and on. They really stress life experience. Also, dont fuck around with relationships either, they contact past partners to inquire about your character. I'm not saying don't have any relationships just........ pick a non crazy lol. \n\nThe other option is to do police foundations, participate in a school sport, volunteer, and be top 3 in your class in grades. Then MAYBE you will be hired on at 19-20 as a cadet........ maybe.",

The Law Enforcement/Security industry is seeing massive shortages of qualified applicants. \n\nI currently work in Security management for an Ontario hospital.  We are losing more people to Policing, Corrections and CBSA than we are able to replace them.  \n\nIt never hurts to have as much education as you can, but there is plenty of work out there right now that you can do to gain experience if you don't feel ready to jump into Policing.  \n\nIf you have any questions I'd be happy help you.",

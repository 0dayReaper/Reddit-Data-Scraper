    "postText": "Hey all! So there\u2019s a room for rent on Third Street really close to the College\u2019s main campus for only 650$ a month (internet/utilities included!)! It also has a dishwasher and a washer/dryer!\n\nNow originally it\u2019s an 11 month lease (starts Sept. 1st ends Sept 1st) but I need to move out by April 1st due to a family matter.\nSo your part of the Lease starts in April and ends in September, you can renew the lease as well for another 11 months though :) so you won\u2019t lose the place.\n\nhttps://www.kijiji.ca/v-room-rental-roommate/london/room-for-rent-close-to-fanshawe/1649818641\n\nYou can find my info here and message me for a viewing (virtual or in person works)!",

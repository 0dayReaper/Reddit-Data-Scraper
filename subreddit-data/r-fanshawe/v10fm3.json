    "postText": "**Hey Falcons, please help us learn how you expect information to be organized!**\n\nWe\u2019re ready to take the next step in building a student service and support website.\n\nFanshawe is developing a more modern online environment to support current students looking for information about College services, supports, events, forms and more. Hundreds of students helped us with focus groups and surveys earlier this spring to tell us what would make the site useful and interesting.\n\n**Now we need to check whether our menu will do its job!**\n\nWe would appreciate your help to test our site navigation. We want the new site to help you find things easily. We are searching for a diverse cross-section of our college community to\u00a0**participate in a quick online\u00a0user test**\u00a0to see if our menu makes sense for students, from the time you pay your deposit to the time you graduate.\n\nWe need a mix of domestic or international students, young and mature students, students with accessibility needs, equity-deserving groups, student leaders, student volunteers or work-study student employees.\n\n**Are you interested in testing the possible new site menu and showing us how you might expect to find information there?** \n\nTell us your thoughts so we can build a new online environment that best reflects the needs of students like you. The user experience test asks you to imagine completing 10 tasks in our new menu and show us where you would expect to find certain information. It will take about 5 to 15 minutes to complete (most people do it in about 6-7 minutes). If you're interested, click the button below to begin.\n\n**Click here to test our site menu!**\n\n[https://b44p5fn8.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/13q81m1p](https://b44p5fn8.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/13q81m1p)\n\n*(Note: unlike our future site, the user testing activity is best completed on a laptop or desktop computer. It can be completed on a mobile device if needed, but may be more difficult \u2013 don\u2019t worry: the new site itself will be mobile friendly!)*",

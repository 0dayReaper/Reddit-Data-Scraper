    "postText": "There's a prof in ELT who speaks basically no English and I can barely understand a word coming out of his mouth because of a language barrier. Everytime I ask him a question after class he's very unhelpful and almost rude because he also can't understand me properly when I speak English. He gave me attitude recently because I asked him a simple question that required a yes or no answer. I'm sick and tired of him and it's endlessly frustrating how he teaches something VERY minimally, says \"everyone get it? Moving on\" before anyone even says anything. I even asked him a question once and he said \"that's common sense\" like fuck you, why don't you just teach me? Dude is driving me crazy. 8 years working in the trades, many years in school and I haven't had a prof/mentor I've disliked this much for their teaching methods and poor attitude towards students.",

Should be easily found on the website if you search up the department your program belongs to.\n\nAlso like someone said, talk to your classmates and voice your concerns together to the head of the department.\n\nIf only one student does it, then they may not take action because they'll feel it's just you that's bothered. It's better to have your classmates come forward together then they'll see it's a much larger concern.",

You need these to pass the course. I go to a different college and no one here has even heard of these things.\n\nIf you want to save some $$$ I'd recommend steering clear of Fanshawe.",

I know some have the fees built in through tuition, but I haven't heard of a college where all textbooks are free. Chances are where you are going you are still paying for your resources, but the costs have been added in to tuition or some other fees so they aren't as obvious. \n\nBTW, I went to college 20 years ago and textbooks were MORE expensive back then. I know it's an annoying thing to pay for, but it's one of the only things in society that has actually gone down in price rather than up.",

But it has \u201cevolved\u201d into something terrible in my opinion. \n\nFor example, some of my courses required the access code and textbook to be bought together. But the textbook has to be hosted on a platform , so you must pay for that too. \n\n-So let\u2019s say the course costs $600-700\n\n-the online textbook can be $100-200\n\n- the access code $50-100\n\n-the service website host $50-100 PER 6 months\n\n\nSo you can spend up to $300 on online material that is really crappy software, hard to navigate through honestly and therefore some people end up buying physically textbooks, AND YOU LOOSE ACCESS TO THE ONLINE TEXTBOOK THAT YOU ALREADY PAID FOR IF YOU DONT RENEW YOUR WEBSITE ACCESS. They are treating it like a Netflix subscription. And professors do this because they have a pay check cut. \n\nThen, if you don\u2019t want to pay an additional $300, you fail the course because ALLL assignments are hosted there. So you MUST pay even if you don\u2019t need the read the textbook to pass\n\nI rather pay for an expensive physical textbook copy ANYDAY. At least I can keep or resell.  OR CHOOSE not to use it as a resource. \n\n(There\u2019s a comment below that says it costed them $1200 for an online code/textbook?)",

I'm pretty sure that almost all courses at fanshawe only require the print textbook OR the access code, not both. Sometimes they are bundled so you can get a better deal if you want both, but they are almost always sold separately. \n3. Prices are usually under 100 per course for the access codes.\n4. If the software sucks, that's on the publisher and not Fanshawe. They don't create the software platforms. Most of the ones I've seen aren't that bad, and competent students learn to use them fairly quickly. \n5. I've never heard of paying \"hosting fees\" on top of paying for the access code. That must be very rare. The major publishers don't charge an extra fee - it's included once you buy the code.",

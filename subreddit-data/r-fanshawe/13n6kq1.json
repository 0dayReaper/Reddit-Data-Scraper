    "postText": "i\u2019m not sure what it is about this semester and the influx of new people who have entered the gym, but there has been time a plenty that myself and others have had to rerack weights for other people.\n\nplease, it\u2019s not that hard. if you can lift it (or try to), you can surely put it back where it\u2019s supposed to go. an individual plate and/or dumbbell is much lighter than the weight in the exercise.\n\nSPECIFICALLY FOR THE PEOPLE USING DUMBBELLS: the rack for the weights with the falcon logo have stickers designating where the weights go. if you can find your weight and use it, you can find where to put it back properly.\n\nthere are good and decent people in this gym who will put the weights back for others (props to these good Samaritans), but frankly my patience is starting to wear thin. please be kind and considerate to others.\n\nthank you for reading my TedTalk",

You literally have to wait 1 to 3 minutes between sets anyway, so lots of time to put things away correctly before moving on to your next exercise or set.",

It\u2019s actually horrible in Thailand, gym I was at in Chiang Mai big group of juicers would just leave a dozen pairs of DB for the employees to pick up.

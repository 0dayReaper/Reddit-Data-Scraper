    "postText": "I mention I\u2019m a student because I feel as a younger driver driving around other students, I\u2019m more understanding than older drivers.\n\nThat being said, please stop complaining and getting hostile with Uber drivers when they deny you a ride for\n\nA) not having a mask \nB) having more than 3 passengers\n\nI\u2019ve been driving all frosh week and I\u2019ve been picking up Fanshawe/western students from packed bars and house parties where I can clearly see 30+ people inside without masks.\n\nFanshawe and UWO students have come back to London from all across the country and have been socializing with each other without social distancing measures. So please don\u2019t get pissy when an Uber/taxi drivers try to enforce safety measures on you. I\u2019ve already been cursed at a few times for disallowing groups of 4-5 people from entering my vehicle.\n\nI understand during the ride you might feel hot, but please don\u2019t hesitate to ask the driver if you can open a window or turn the AC on, we would much prefer that over taking your mask off mid ride.\n\nSide note: please stop saying \u201cI\u2019ll tip you in the app\u201d and then not tipping. That\u2019s pretty disrespectful to promise a tip then proceed to cheap out. We don\u2019t expect tips ,but promising a tip (most likely promising a tip in order to do you a favour like stopping at McDonald\u2019s or a 7/11) and getting the driver to thank you for it then not tipping is shady.",

After all, you are providing your own car to drive others to one place to another, they need to ask themselves what if they were in your position.\n\nFrom what I know a few students at UWO was tested positive so you have every right to enforce a safety measure. I hope you stay safe.",

This is all just common sense.\n\nIf you don't believe in COVID or think the government is being too harsh or demanding for what you can/can't do, that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion, but don't get mad when someone else stays true to their opinion as well.\n\nIn this case, if your driver is upholding proper safety measures that are either legally and/or ethically correct, why give them a hard time? They're just doing what's best for them (and everyone else).\n\nEither way. If you are still driving Uber, I hope people are being more understanding and appreciative of what you do for them. Stay safe!\n\nNote: This post is 3 months old... I was just searching the \"Top of All Time\" searches on this sub and seen this and decided to give it a read. That's why I'm commenting 3 months later lol",

No posts and only one comment: this one.\n\nStop trolling.\n\nTo suggest that people who are older are not empathetic because they don\u2019t have the same experience is stupid. You don\u2019t know what their life was and what the experience. It may very well be the case that an older person has more in common with a younger person due to their life experiences. You have no idea what others life experiences are - yes, young people relate better to their peers - but that has **nothing** to do with empathy and compassion (age is not a predicting factor for someone to be empathetic to another).\n\nFind something else to do with you time. Hiding behind what appears to be an alt account is asinine.",

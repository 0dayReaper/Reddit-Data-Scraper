Was thinking Falcon house would be favoured as it is attached to the school so would make it easy to get to class during inclement weather. We were told they were all the same regardless of which you got into.\n\nNot sure which way to lean so does anyone have a favourite and why?",

The atrium space is really nice.\n\nFalcon is more dingy and Peregrine is kinda dingy but it's manageable\n\nI lived in Merlin and Peregrine and enjoyed Merlin the most.",

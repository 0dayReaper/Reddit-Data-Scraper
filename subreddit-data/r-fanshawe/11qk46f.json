I expected three letters of recommendations and cv/resume with fantastic experiences like you apply to a master's school but nothing like that is listed.\n\nCan anyone who applied to cannabis applied science or other post-graduate certificate programs tell me about your experience of the application process?\n\nI already sent an inquiry about this weeks ago to the college but got no replies yet...",

Did you know there is a pathways scholarship worth $1000 for internal pathways like from pre-health to RT or RPN?   \n\n\nAll of our Health Science programs are demanding, but if you make use of learning supports, stay organized and ask for help when you need it, you can totally be successful!",

I\u2019d suggest going for the collaborative program if you get in, after 10 years of working RN your making 50$ hour if your in hospital whereas RPN starts and tops out at 32$.",

We start at 31.27$ (I might be off by a few cents I can\u2019t remember exactly what I started at) and we top out at the high end of 32$ from what I\u2019m told. RN starts at 32$ and tops out after 10 years at 49$ there union is wayyyy better then the RPN union for negotiating.",

But if you are passionate about MRT, go for it if you get it. \n\nNursing is in super high demand across Canada. \nHigher pay in the US I believe. \nI know some travelling nurses.\n\n\n\nGood luck.",

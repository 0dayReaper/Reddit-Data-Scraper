    "postText": "Hi, I recently got accepted into the Advanced Pre-Health program and I plan to do hygiene afterwards. I was wondering if anyone has gone through the pre-health program and what was your average that got you accepted into the DH program. Also is there any advantage with applying to the DH at the same college (fanshawe) and do DH applicants take any placement test? What has been your experience with the prehealth program?",

No one who applied directly from high school was admitted this year.   \n\n\nHopefully this helps.",

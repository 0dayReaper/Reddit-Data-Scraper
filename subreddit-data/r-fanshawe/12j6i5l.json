The faculty in that program are amazing and they connect you with a lot of industry people as well to help you learn about different spaces and different design techniques. It's a really cool program and I've only ever heard good things from our students.   \n\n\n**Meeting others:**   \nIf you haven't already, join our discord [www.fanshawec.ca/discord](https://www.fanshawec.ca/discord) and our Instagram group: [https://instagram.com/fanshawefirstyear202324?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=](https://instagram.com/fanshawefirstyear202324?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)  \n\n\n**Meal Plan**: Living in traditional residence you have a mandatory $1200 meal plan, this is considered a \"light\" meal plan and you can add more money to it at any point.  The meal plan is like a declining cash balance. It can be used anywhere on campus (and hopefully soon a few places off campus - we're working on it). Oasis is nestle inbetween the traditional residences in the student centre and it's got a bit of everything - cafe, pasta, stir fry, all day breakfast, rotating specials with Shelby's, tortillas and wraps, etc. Also on campus is the Out Back Shack the on campus restaurant and pub. Additionally there is Tim Hortons, Starbucks, Pizza Pizza, Subway, Harveys and a few other options will hopefully be open again next year.   \n\n\n**Additionally:**  you can get a. small fridge for your room and you do have access to a community kitchen that is on one floor in each traditional building, that has a stove and such. There are some small appliances that are allowed in residence and some that are not, so check the residence rules before buying anything.",

The teachers at Seneca are not very helpful at all.  90% of the time, they tell you to google the answers to your questions. Many of the \"teachers\" have very thick accents and are very hard to understand.  There are still many services here that are not in person.  You get given a ticket number and hope someone responds within a week if you're lucky.  Food on campus is also very limited. Most choices are closed by 3 pm.  If you want dinner, you have to have it before 6 pm.  I'm actually transferring to another college in September.  I don't have a positive reason to stay here to study.",

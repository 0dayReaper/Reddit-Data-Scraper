If that\u2019s the case you will get an email letting you know the retest date.\n\nDepending on the circumstances you may be able to ask for an informal appeal to write a supplemental exam.  I would start with an email to whoever taught that course and see what they suggest.",

Obviously you should know each role but the most important part of all of this is teamwork and communication.  If you notice your partner has forgotten something, find a way to nicely ask or remind them.  You share a grade so have each other\u2019s backs.\n\nAlso, take your time!  Once the lead is done talking to the patient and assessing and the assistant has collected all the equipment take a moment as a team to do a brief intubation pause and go over what assessments were done, what equipment is prepared and what the plan is.  If either of you have forgotten anything it will hopefully be caught during that point.  After that, make sure you\u2019re both ready and only then ask to push meds and proceed.  \n\nGood luck!",

Once the ceremony starts, it is usually less than an hour. The longer ones are about an hour. After that, there is a reception and most families take photos and hang out for a while. So in total you can expect to be there about 3 hours, but the ceremony will only be an hour long.",

A solid 1.5hr was graduates walking the stage.  Since this was a summer graduation, I was thinking it was likely smaller than spring grad would be.  \n\nNow that I've done it once, they can mail me my next one LOL.",

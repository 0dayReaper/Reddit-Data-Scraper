    "postText": "I\u2019m graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s in Health Sciences from Western this upcoming year but I\u2019m applying with my high school marks for all the prerequisites (they were higher than what I got in uni). I\u2019ve read that students applying from pre-health get additional points/consideration over others, so I was wondering if I should do that instead of just going in with my high school marks (and degree but I don\u2019t actually know if they look at that - please clarify if I\u2019m wrong!) \n\nFor context, the average of my prereqs are at about 91-92 for both programs but that\u2019s super close to the competitive cutoffs that are on the website, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little torn. Is this competitive enough to be accepted into either program? \n\nAny insight at all would be highly appreciated, thank you!! :)",

So you could apply to all three of you wish, but you could also apply to just RT and MRT and if you aren\u2019t successful our admissions team often offers and additional pathway option, like through pre-health.",

Just to clarify, if I apply for just RT and MRT but am not successful, then I\u2019ll still receive an offer for pre-health/something similar? Does this mean I wouldn\u2019t need to apply to pre-health in my OCAS application as a \u201cback-up\u201d?",

So it is your choice if you want to apply just in case.\n\nAs I said you have 5 slots in OCAS per application. Three can be at the same college.\n\nIf you have the space for pre health it doesn\u2019t hurt to apply. If you\u2019d rather fill those five spots elsewhere you can take the chance and not include it. Hopefully that makes sense",

            "comment": "Pre-health does give applicants extra points and it does help to get into competitive healthcare programs. Other post-secondary education is considered as well, but I don't know how much weight it carries, or if someone with a degree in Health Sciences is given additional consideration. Your application through OCAS will require your high school and post-secondary transcripts.  \nI recommend reaching out to Fanshawe's admissions team and a pathway advisor to get accurate info and advice.  \nOnce it comes time to apply, apply to all 3 programs- RT, MRT, and Pre-Health.",

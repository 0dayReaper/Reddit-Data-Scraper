    "postText": "so im an upcoming student at Fanshawe this September and i was looking around to see what its like and the experience, and from what i see and saw in this subreddit, i feel somewhat worried as to  what im getting into. A lot of posts are always talking about how programs are uncoordinated and the college cant get competent professors (still dont know why they cant), and how any certificate or degree from here is useless because you learn nothing, im always a skeptic to fear mongering and people exaggerating their experience, so i want to hear some honest non emotional and non exaggerated experience and feed back from people. is this college really that bad as they make it to be?, pls help.",

I\u2019ve had AMAZING professors and really only a few subpar but it didn\u2019t make or break the class. All of the professors I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being taught from have been extremely helpful. In my course I find my class are starting sync up at the end (helps with understanding) but note that college is not meant to be a cake walk and not everyone will pass. Do not let this discourage you. I\u2019ve had many class mates drop out my course because of their in ability to understand the concepts. \n\nAlso worth mentioning that the state of the world isn\u2019t great and I\u2019ve seen some teacher just be burnt out from \u201clife\u201d but in my experience it has not effected my learning.",

Always a good idea to read the policies so you know when you can challenge profs and when you can\u2019t. Really, as with any post secondary institution- you will learn useful things for your field- but 90% of the job you get will be learned on the job. It is like that everywhere. Every employer knows that a new employee isn\u2019t going to know everything- but one with a diploma/certificate has demonstrated commitment to learning.\n\nAlso, employers want people who have had to work with others before (group work), people who can write a proper sentence/email (WRIT/COMM), people who understand that their world view is not the only world view (Gen Ed\u2019s). Essentially College preps you for working with others, and gives you the opportunity to work with equipment or programs not available to others who haven\u2019t gone to college. \n\nFocus on earning that fancy piece of paper with your name on it. Don\u2019t plagiarize or do anything else to get an academic offence. Aka- do the work, get out and find a job that wants that piece of paper.",

The profs/instructors have been great for the most part, but they tend to assign a ton of work starting near the end of the term. So we spend the first two months of classes in lectures trying to memorize as much as possible, then after reading week we get a bunch of tests and research papers to do. Currently have 3.\n\nThe program is also designed so that we have 8 courses in term 2. It has been somewhat enjoyable, but also disappointing because it often makes me feel like I'm in high school again, just learning the very basics of things. \n\nMost of my professors have been teaching this program for over 10 years, and they're constantly talking about how burned out they are from the college politics and how little funding the program receives from the college.",

            "comment": "I can answer about the professors. Its not Fanshawe, it is every college. In 2018 iirc, all colleges across Ontario changed the standard in order to be a tenured professor. The requirement now is that every applicant must have a Masters degree or preferred a PhD. For this reason, their getting fewer applicants, and even fewer quality applicants. Colleges are geared towards practical skill development to prepare you for a workplace. Here is a posting for the cyber security program.\n\n[https://jobs.fanshawec.ca/postings/3661](https://jobs.fanshawec.ca/postings/3661)\n\nYou can see in it, a Masters is required, while a PhD is preferred. With only five years of work experience. That means that someone has at minimum an equal amount of time in school themselves as to their work experience. That puts a lot more emphasis on their own education then the skills that they can teach others. It can be compared to how you study, do you actually understand what you are doing in class, or are you just regurgitating it. People with more school then work experience will have the same issue, they will regurgitate the information they were taught rather then develop new materials form their own experience.\n\nI have friends that teach at Fanshawe, Durham, Conestoga, Centennial, the list goes on. The issue is everywhere.\n\nThis leads to instructors being part time because they don't meet the requirements for fulltime employment. Where they receive not a lot of money tbh. They only get paid for the number of credit hours per week of their class. No time for marking, prepping classes, or creating new materials.\n\nThe college itself is a learning curve, everything operates through email, very few services have phone numbers for students. This leads to slow communication and often students get frustrated with the lack of progress they see as a result.\n\n85% of the issues you read about on this forum are illegitimate. The root cause of them is what I wrote above, its not the college, its every college.",

            "comment": "So I can\u2019t really comment on the college in general but I can talk about the experiences of my (small) class and I. I can also guarantee that this is completely non-emotional and void of any exaggeration.\n\nI wish I could tell you differently, but I\u2019m currently in one of the college\u2019s only four-year degree programs (which you think would contain a high standard of professionalism, but my class and I have had to deal with so much mediocracy thus far. We\u2019ve had professors who would berate students while presenting (one of which is also our program coordinator if that tells you anything about how this organization is run), many who are so disorganized that it severely harms the students (not giving us enough time to complete projects because they forgot to assign them even though *we* reminded *them*), a professor who taught us as though we already knew everything and didn\u2019t help us learn, a professor who cancelled more classes than they attended, a professor who was more demotivating than motivating, a professor who kicked students out of his class without following protocol because he thought they were abusing their accommodations for their documented disabilities. The worst part about the last example is that instead of the college making the professor grade the students\u2019 work and admitting they messed up, they\u2019re making the student (who is an international student and here on a very strict visa) take the whole course again in the summer with the same professor.\n\nOn top of all this, the actual content of my four-year program isn\u2019t at all specific enough to make us valuable candidates in the workforce. My program is sort of an amalgamation of other diploma programs stretched out over time, but lacks a lot of important aspects that these two- or three-year diploma programs are achieving. So I mentioned this to my program coordinator, stating that I won\u2019t be able to compare with the knowledge and practical skills that the diploma programs have, and he looked embarrassed and didn\u2019t have a clear response, so even he\u2019s aware of the differences.\n\nI\u2019m sure by now you can understand why my classmates and I are constantly asking each other, \u201chow do we pay some of the highest tuition at the college to attend a degree program, yet we still get screwed around so frequently?\u201d Well I wish I had the answer, but what I will say is that I wouldn\u2019t at all be surprised if other people in different programs are having similar issues. There isn\u2019t enough action taken to reprimand these professors when they\u2019re bad at their job or just bad people in general.\n\nIn my two years (so far), I\u2019ve maybe had 12 different profs, and the bad ones far outweigh the good ones, unfortunately, in terms of quantity and quality (or lack thereof). The part-time, non-tenured staff are always far better than the full-time, tenured, Sunshine List professors.",

They all struggled with the  consistency and quality of their professors. It's a ubiquitous issue in education because you're essentially putting the entire student experience in a course in the hands of one person and all of their idiosyncrasies and character traits. \n\nFor example, many of the smartest people I know would and have made terrible teachers because they can't relate to people who don't have the natural aptitude to just \"get it\" immediately. They're conduits of information, not *teachers*, but they're incredibly qualified on paper in their field, so they get hired.\n\nOther profs are just... unhappy. That can obviously be due to a lot of factors but one that transcends post-secondary institutions is that educators aren't exactly treated well by administrations. Non-tenured profs are often used and discarded like replaceable contractors with no stability in their lives. this can last for a decade... If they somehow become tenured, they're already burned out from all of the politics and bullshit that takes place in academia. I have heard this exact story from people who teach in the trades, languages, humanities, stem, and at law and med schools. \n\nSo, what I'm getting at, is that the issues you might hear about Fanshawe likely exist everywhere and I would be very skeptical that the grass would be much greener at a different college.",

Took 2 weeks into class before I was reinstated and they said \"oops, our bad\"\n\nOne of my friends had a prof who simply didnt teach them. Used old powepoints and videos from 4 years prior(From an entirely different prof who left the college), and said that you could email them if you want but you should try to figure it out on your own since they wouldnt be checking emails daily.\n\nI have countless tales of my limited time with Fanshawe and the people I knew there. The issue with professors boils down to luck. You could teach at the college with nothing more than \"industry experience\". Because of that you dont get teachers; you get semi-retired workers who never learned how to teach. Newer teachers (hired post 2018) require at least a Masters, which is a start at least. I've had profs in other colleges who graduated from the program, worked 3 years, then turned around and came back to teach that exact same program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire point of most programs is to hand-hold you through learning the fundamentals of whatever field you want to get into, and give you a piece of paper that makes getting a job in that field slightly easier.",

Fanshawe is a terrible garbage school and they'll wrap you up in red tape to keep you from complaining, receiving recompense, or having to change themselves.\n\nMy first year outta high school was the strike, a completely understandable thing for the teachers to do considering how they're treated. Except my second semester of the program I was in turned into a disaster because of it. We came back after months of nothing and were told, \"hey kids we expect you to complete all the shit you were supposed to over the period of a full semester in the little time we have left.\" Everyone was over worked, we never handed in completed projects, I personally slept at the school at least three days a week most weeks just to get shit done. Most people in the course were in similar if not worse off boats. Plus none of us received any money back even though our semester was essentially cut in half time wise.\n\nYet, only one woman didn't pass because a professor called the school constable on her after she had a mental break during class. He didn't even show up that day and instead tried to detain her when she was in a different class entirely. The professor, one of the two only stand up ones, refused to let him in and she stopped showing up after that. The other stand up professor left at the end of the semester because she was parttime and making more money working midnights at a gas station. Most of my professors were garbage and the few who weren't were either under payed or taking personal time to help the students. A noble idea that none of them should have felt obligated to do.\n\nI'm still struggling to this day to get ANY of the paper work saying I passed my courses even though the school has acknowledged I've done so. Hell, when I called to ask about it I found out that I received a third diploma that no one told me about!\n\nAs for other people, well my girlfriend transfered out because of how much of a nightmare just dealing with the school was. Another close friend moved back home and nearly gave up on post secondary education entirely. My best bud is currently struggling threw a pretty intense program. Not because she's bad at the course, no this woman is like a math prodigy and just gets it. The reason is over 50% of her professors are garbage and she has to spend her free time teaching herself the material.\n\nThe worst part about all this is I've heard similar stories in regards to most Ontario colleges/universities. \n\nTl;dr Fanshawe doesn't know what it's left or right hands are doing and it fucks the students hard because of it. However, I don't believe there's a better alternative. \n\nSorry for formating/any spelling or grammatical errors.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

I thought that the professors/ teaching was generally pretty good, all my proffs were people who had industry experience and had a lot to add to the course materials. There was an issue where one of the proffs  quit and went to go work somewhere else a couple months into the school year which threw a bit of a wrench into things for their class, and ultimately that part of it was a bit of a write off. We also had a mandatory English proficiency/ grammar/ writing class that was mandatory b/c there are so many international students but that was a waste of time for me as I grew up in Canada and had a BA so no need to review English grammar. \n\nMy biggest complaint about the program was that I didn't think I learned enough to actually go out and get a job in IT security. I didn't have a background in IT prior to going in just was good at computers and learning from troubleshooting tech issues my entire life, and I didn't learn enough to actually contribute anything in a real job. The material we were learning wasn't super current, most of our labs and lectures focussed on Windows XP, but this was at a time when Windows Vista had come and gone, 7 was the go to version that everyone actually used, and Windows 8 came out midway through the year. Even the company I was working for at the time has recently transitioned away from XP and they used it way longer than any other entity I know of.\n\nAt the same time I did learn a bunch of life lessons from the whole experience, but they're things like there's no easy answer for success, it just takes a lot of hard work, and a lot of perseverance, the way forward for me wasn't to do with going back to school I needed to engage with my job, the job market etc to get where I wanted to go. Also that colleges don't really care about you and are happy to take your money, I applied to a bunch of different programs and got accepted to every single one regardless of whether I had any background in the subject matter (these were post grad programs). \n\nUltimately the certificate I got hasn't really gotten me anywhere, it's somewhat related to what I do now, but overall the program seemed designed for people who were already in the field or already in IT who are looking to upgrade their skills a bit or maybe move into management or something like that.",

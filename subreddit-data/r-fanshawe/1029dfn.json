I didn\u2019t know we could just start USING it everywhere immediately \ud83d\ude2d I feel soo stupid because I later found out this was explained back when I was admitted for animation 3 years ago but that\u2019s when I dropped out cause of Covid. (Also since it was online anyways I never got my student ID it was just sorta sitting there at the school until I picked it up last month) Guess I forgot, the more y\u2019a know.",

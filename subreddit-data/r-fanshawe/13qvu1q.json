    "postText": "I\u2019ve recently been thinking long and hard about career options and I\u2019d really like to go back to school to do a trade.\n\nI currently work in the hospital and after the past few years, I just can\u2019t see myself doing this long term no matter how many different things I can do within nursing itself. It\u2019s not the worst career, but the price I\u2019m paying for my mental health to suffer is no longer worth it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call myself smart in a textbook sense but I really enjoy hands on learning. Therefore, I think a trade may be somewhat beneficial for me to switch into.\n\nDoes anybody have any trade suggestions that would be good to go into? I would be willing to go to adult school to acquire any missing credits that I need to enter a program.",

Carter Services maybe?\n\nAlternatively: there is probably some sort of Career Test / Aptitude Test available from an employment agency that might be able to help (both Fleming College and Georgian College offer that service; I'd be very surprised if Fanshawe doesn't have something similar).",

It's not easy to get accepted into but if you have decent grades it's very hands on and you're always busy.",

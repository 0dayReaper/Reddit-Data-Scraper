    "postText": "Hey everyone! Quick question about graduation this summer! I'm graduating June 14th at 3PM, which is Ceremony 4. I'm graduating from the Business Human Resources Diploma program. I just wanted to know, is there a specific time we're supposed to be at the ceremony by? I realize that I'm asking a bit early and that the college usually sends out an email in mid May with all the details, but I'm just trying to coordinate my plans for the day of the ceremony.\n\nIf anyone has any insight from past graduation ceremonies starting at the same time, that'd be great.\n\nThank you ahead of time and congratulations to all the graduates this year!!",

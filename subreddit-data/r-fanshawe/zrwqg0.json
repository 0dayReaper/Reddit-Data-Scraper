    "postText": "\nI just came out of working there a while ago and I wanted to share my experience with it. This was originally going to be posted in r/londonontario however I thought I\u2019d post it here to let other Fanshawe students know about this since it\u2019s something that\u2019s advertising all over campus.\n\nI\u2019d obviously first heard of them through Fanshawe since they had a table set up and posters. And of course, not knowing anything and needing work and money, I signed up, and was given an interview time for later that day, which was a bit strange. I did the interview which I didn\u2019t realize until I did it that it was a group interview. There was a part at the end where I met with the recruiter individually and after some questions I was told I got the job.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks later when I start training (it was delayed due to school and my illness, which becomes important later on). I found it sort of irritating that the training sessions (which there were 3 of them, for me it was Thurs, Fri, Sat) were each about 7-8 hours long and they were unpaid. So I was sitting there for hours learning about the knives and how to sell them.\n\nAfter training the selling commenced, which was essentially bothering EVERYONE you know that fits their demographic (30+, married, homeowner) until you\u2019ve exhausted your list. And they constantly bothered and pressured me to call every single person even when I had no one left to call.\n\nAnother thing that really infuriated me with working was how little they seemed to care that I was chronically ill and going through sickness. There was a few times I had to miss advanced training or meetings because I was suffering through a flare up and heading downtown, which usually triggers it and/or makes it worse would not be any help. They were insistent that I come anyway or \u201cwear a mask\u201d. At first I gave in because I didn\u2019t want it be a nuisance or risk being let go, but near the end I started saying no, that I couldn\u2019t\n\nThe negative things I experienced from working with vector outweigh any positives, which, the only positive was gaining a bit of business experience and getting a taste of sale. Not to mention that throughout the 2 months I worked and earned over $900 CPO I only was paid $60 for my work. The practices and whole thing is shady as HELL. Please, do not waste your time. There are plenty of job opportunities all over London for students. Don\u2019t work for such a shady and scam-y company.",

The whole thing just seemed off and secretive because I got an interview/secured a spot from my friends boss who texted me on regular iMessage\u2026it was a professional message but I\u2019m not sure why it wasn\u2019t by email. My interview was online and the interviewer was in my age group which was odd. The whole video about vector was like a boasting sorta infomercial not even telling us what we can expect and what we will be doing. It was all just people talking about how great the company is and how it changed their lives.",

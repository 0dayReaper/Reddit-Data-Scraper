Not sure how competitive the program is and if this might factor in your admission chances.\n\nThis link has more info on English requirements, as well as a link at the top to contact a Pre-Admissions Advisor if you have further questions.\n\n[https://www.fanshawec.ca/admission-finance/before-applying/admission-requirements/english-requirements](https://www.fanshawec.ca/admission-finance/before-applying/admission-requirements/english-requirements)",

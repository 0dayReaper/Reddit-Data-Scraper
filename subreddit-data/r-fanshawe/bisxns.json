    "postText": "I had someone just ask me today through here about the prehealth textbooks and if I thought they were worth purchasing. I figure others might be wondering too. Here's my opinion on them and I hope someone finds it useful. I've just finished the program last week too.\n \nTextbooks are used differently in every class. I would say the following:\n\n-Physics-Dont bother with this one at all as the professors post plenty of their own worksheets for us. If you need more problems to work with it might be helpful but i felt the worksheets were sufficient and the book is an expensive one\n\n-Chemistry- this book is also an expensive one but offers good explanations and lots of practice problems.  I found this one helpful when I struggled with some concepts but you might be able to get away with not purchasing it or splitting the cost with a classmate and sharing it as it isn't used too regularly.  You can get by with the posted worksheets and tutorial questions. The Professors do assign homework out of this book and some of them are beyond the level needed for the tests,  so if you can do the textbook questions.... you'll be well prepared. \n\n-Practical Applications 1 and 2- these are two separate books and the ones I regret purchasing the most.  They're a cut and paste from different textbooks,  no table of contents or index to find material easily,  the page numbers don't line up and readings aren't used at all with the exception of a few questions asked on the online exams. They're only good for personal interest as there's some good content to read but this program doesn't allow for too much time to do that. \n\n-Biology&amp;Anatomy- this is a must buy,  it never left my bag and I was using it for reference for all 8 months.  These two classes use the same book extensively and a big difference between those who did well in the class and those who didn't is did you use the book well?  I bought mine used and it was obviously not in anywhere near new condition and now it's completely ragged! \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\nI would caution though that everyone is now reselling the 1st edition and the program coordinator told the students at the open house that they maybe using a 2nd edition this fall. If you don't mind the older edition it might drop in price once everyone realizes it's no longer the current version. \n\n-Math- definitely buy it,  especially if you're not the strongest at math, the teachers use it alot, all the homework is assigned from it and the teachers give marks for completed work too.\n\n-WRIT- I didn't take this class but I was told the book was useless,  so it'll probably be best to wait and see what your prof says if you take it (make sure you take the WRIT assessment and try to pass it so you don't need to take this class)\n\nHopefully this was helpful",

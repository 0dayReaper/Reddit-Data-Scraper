You are automatically enrolled in your mandatory courses and only need to register for something if you have a general elective. \n\nWRIT for fall should open soon, details should be fanshawec.ca/writ soon. It is now administered online. You\u2019ll be asked to read something and write a response to it in proper essay format. \n\nYes there are on campus jobs. For example Athletics hires about 100 people a year. We are having a opportunities day July 25, watch our social media for details soon. But there are other jobs as well, you can Check with Chartwells or keep an eye on the job board that you can access through FOL later this summer. Additionally check our fsu.ca for their hiring as well.",

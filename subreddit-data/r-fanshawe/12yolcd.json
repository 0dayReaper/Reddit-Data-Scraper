Depending on your situation; if what you're getting paid is over a certain amount you won't get any funding from OSAP. \n\nAlso if you end up getting paid more than you declared on your application, you may have to pay it back at a later date, either by having bursary funding converted to loan, or by just getting less money in a future term.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nIf you're looking for a meaningful way to give back to your community, Big Brothers Big Sisters of London and Area is currently seeking volunteers to become community-based mentors for youth in need.\n\nAs a mentor, you'll be paired with a young person and spend a few hours each week doing fun activities together, building a friendship and making a positive impact in their life. This is a great opportunity to be a positive role model and provide support to a young person who needs it most.\n\nNo special skills or experience are necessary \u2013 just a willingness to be a good listener, offer encouragement, and be a consistent presence in a young person's life.

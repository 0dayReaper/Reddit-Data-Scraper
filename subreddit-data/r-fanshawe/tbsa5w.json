    "postText": "The Ontario government has announced updates to COVID-19 restrictions, including masking requirements in some indoor settings. \n\nFanshawe College is not included in those settings and will continue to require masks. \n\nThe guidance framework for post-secondary institutions remains in place through April. In alignment with this, and in keeping with recommendations from the Middlesex-London Health Unit, masks will continue to be required indoors at all Fanshawe campuses for the rest of the winter 2022 semester, which ends on April 29. \n\nOntario\u2019s Chief Medical Officer of Health has noted masking requirements may return if a new variant arrives. We may also see masking requirements during next winter\u2019s flu season. We will provide updates if these requirements come into effect. \n\nWe expect further restrictions to gradually lift in post-secondary institutions over the next six weeks, and we will continue to provide updates as they are known.",

It is a vague course and I regret not taking something more narrowed down like an engineering or software developer course which makes you much more viable within a company,  \n\n\nAt the end of the day, it depends on what you are pursuing. If you want to start a company, you are better off taking a course specific to the industry and learning business information on your own. I've retained more from business audiobooks and books following the course but each person is different.",

    "postText": "The Ontario government has required COVID-19 vaccination policies in high-risk settings and at post-secondary institutions. In response, the Student Wellness Centre at Fanshawe will implement a mandatory vaccine policy for membership. The new policy will require that anyone accessing fitness facilities or services in person, show proof that they are fully vaccinated or have an approved medical exemption.\n\nThe policy will take effect on Wednesday, September 22, 2021. To help make this transition as smooth as possible, the Student Wellness Centre has implemented a confidential, one-time-only proof of vaccination validation process.\n\nPlease note: Fanshawe College has implemented a COVID-19 vaccine policy for all students, employees, contractors and visitors who attend any Fanshawe campus or affiliate locations. The policy is effective as of September 7, 2021 with a grace period until November 5, 2021. Those who are not fully vaccinated by November 5, 2021 and do not have an approved medical exemption will not be permitted on campus (meaning you must receive your second dose by Friday, October 22 to be compliant with the policy).

There aren't enough work spaces with outlets throughout the campus. Most of the year, the tables in the courtyard aren't used because it's too cold out.  Most of the time all the study spaces are taken.",

I get when you can have a lot of windows its naturally dark, but the colours are also dark which makes it that much more dreary. The building itself felt very 'dated'- old tables and chairs, there didn't seem to be a lot of outlets or USB stations.\n\nThe gym area I think it was felt very updated, bright, and lively, it's just too bad the rest of the building didn't seem the same.",

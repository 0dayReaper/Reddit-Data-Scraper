            "comment": "I did a year of the accelerated nursing program at Queen\u2019s and I\u2019m starting RT in the fall at Fanshawe. \n\nFrom my experience and observations, RT and nursing both require a thorough understanding of pathophysiology and therapeutics. RT includes more technical skills like vent troubleshooting, while nursing includes more psychosocial training. RT is also focused around cardiorespiratory conditions (and their common comorbidities), while nursing includes a wider variety of conditions to learn about (but in less detail).\n\nI ultimately went down the RT route because I didn\u2019t like the politics of nursing and the overwhelming responsibility for ALL of the patient\u2019s care - if something goes wrong the first person blamed is the nurse. Also all of the skills I enjoyed in nursing school (oxygen therapy, med administration, assessments) are part of RT without the stuff I didn\u2019t like (hygiene, toileting). \n\nIf you wanted less theory, you could go down the RPN route. However, in the real world, you will be doing the same job as an RN with less training and compensation (there are obviously some exceptions but scope creep is very real). \n\nBoth professions require advanced critical thinking skills and continued education. If you want to finish your degree/diploma and be done with learning, then I don\u2019t think healthcare is the right direction.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to PM",

As it should be.\n\nWould you want an RT or nurse taking care of your family member in the ICU who only graduated from an 'easy' program and doesn't know their stuff?",

I have heard from many people that RT is very tough and they even don\u2019t have any free time on holidays. But i did my best to be accepted for Nursing and RT. I love both so it would be great if I can get more advice to decide ;)",

However some of my classmates worked part-time and were able to do well, whereas some others were just barely passing. I think it depends on your study habits and how well you can time manage",

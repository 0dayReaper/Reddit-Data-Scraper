    "postText": "I am in the CPA program, I am doing well in all subjects except C programming. The prof just writes code while partially explaining it as he goes, but then it turns out that isn\u2019t the way to write the code and changes it all bit by bit. Very difficult to take notes from, provides no slides or study material. The other sections have different profs who do provide slides and study material. I have emailed the program coordinator but had no reply, has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you handle it?. \n\nEdit: when we receive projects I go through the lectures to find relevant information that could help, but what he teaches is not helpful for the projects. We have to teach ourselves basically.",

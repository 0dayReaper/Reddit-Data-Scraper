    "postText": "Hello! I am a gr12 high school student at John Paul II and I could really use your help in my study. I am doing a study on how ASD affects students' schooling experience. I'm asking high school, college, and university students to fill out an interview questionnaire. All can participate, whether you're formally diagnosed, self diagnosed, or don't have ASD id love to hear about your school experience.\n\nIf you have the time to fill it out id appreciate it! It's completely anonymous and the data will only be seen by me. Thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nASD Student Interview Questionnaire\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZQJwnVOOLLrN3cF5vA\\_3u\\_Hpvoc8lVtvfVHfzJI3rBdsmcQ/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZQJwnVOOLLrN3cF5vA_3u_Hpvoc8lVtvfVHfzJI3rBdsmcQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) \n\nNon-ASD Student Participants Interview Questionnaire\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoaPLT94IJAiR1LmCjB1pmJLpNDABzfSc4cd0CK21NAdD2nQ/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoaPLT94IJAiR1LmCjB1pmJLpNDABzfSc4cd0CK21NAdD2nQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

            "comment": "Depends what path you are thinking of taking in your career, personally I did web scripting because I have no interest in pursuing a career in game development. It was all JavaScript, it also helped a lot in third semester because the client side course has some JavaScript. The students who took game engines did seem to enjoy the course, the web scripting course was a little boring but an easy A.",

            "comment": "Both of them are pretty easy. The JavaScript can be all over the place depending on who teaches it. Most complex thing we did in it was make an object with a function.\n\n I wouldn't stress too much about it. Neither one is going to have any bearing on your career what so ever.",

            "comment": "Programming Commercial Game Engines will teach you a lot, but as far as a resume booster goes it's only going to pop out if you're going into game development. I've heard it's pretty hard(I did not take it) so take that into consideration. Web Scripting-Intro(Which I took) is a good foundation if you're going into web-development and will give you a solid foundation for Evans client-sever and JavaScript classes you'll be doing in Semesters 4 and 5. It's also not too difficulty and generally for me was a pretty easy A+.\n\nIf you're unsure what to take, or generally indifferent to game development, I would take Web Scripting-Intro. There's a lot more work in web development than game development and if you're looking to have an easier time getting a job after graduation then Web Scripting-Intro is going to be a better asset. Mind you, once you actually get past semester 3 regardless of what you take both classes don't matter much by the end of the program.",

I really enjoyed working in Unity and it was my first introduction to programming in C# (which I also enjoy). I don't know if Jim Leedham is still teaching it but he is one of the best professors I've ever had. Can't recommend it enough.\n\nI heard web scripting was pretty boring. Sure it teaches you the basics of javascript but you learn the basics of javascript later on anyways. My recommendation is game engines.",

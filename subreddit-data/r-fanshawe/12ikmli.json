We weren't saying anything illegal or wrong, they just didn't like us saying critical things about them. It is possible on your first day someone may go around asking everyone to join a discord server. Someone did that for my program and we maintain that server for about 2 years.\n\nEdit: I didn't take the mobile program but I did take the analyst program which is in the same department",

Unless the server owner does some sort of check to ensure only students are joining, a discord server is fairly public. If the owner posts the invite anywhere easily accessible, then teachers can easily join. Should teachers be joining students discord servers? It can be argued it's kind of rude because the server is meant for students. My best advice if you're going to start a discord server for your class is to never use your real names and make sure your discord name isn't recognizably you. That way if anything is said that teachers disagree with then they can't pin it on anyone.",

Don't just do the homework assignments and then leave it at that, try to create small programs on your own that explore the topic further. If you understand the concepts you're being taught beyond what the teachers are telling you to do then you'll have a much better understanding.\n\nAlways do the homework assignments and projects as early as possible. I had too many classmates who would start the project the day before and then encounter unexpected coding related issues. You're not always going to have issues but it's very frustrating when you come across an error and the project is supposed to have been submitted at midnight.\n\nWhen co-ops open up, apply to every single one. Our co-op coordinator warned us about turning down co-op opportunities that we didn't want to do and if we turned out too many then we would risk being blocked from the co-op board. What we found out was that there were very few co-ops and by cherry picking the ones that we thought we wanted many of us ended up not getting a co-op. Additionally, don't rely on your co-op coordinator to review your resume. Our co-op coordinator reviewed many of our resumes and told us they were good only to find out later that they were horrible. Get a parent or someone who works in business that you know to look at your resume and give suggestions.\n\nDon't be scared about correcting your teachers if they're wrong. Remember, this isn't high school anymore. You are paying for a service so if the service is subpar then it is within your right to complain about it.. During our last semester, one of our teachers obviously didn't know how to code and was incorrectly marking a lot of our assignments. And these weren't small mistakes, they were incorrectly marking how to correctly create a database table. We had to submit documentation from Microsoft to prove that we were getting marked incorrectly. We once had a teacher forget to open the Dropbox and even unlock an assignment for us so we had to complain to the college when the teacher refused to give us an extension despite being at fault.\n\nAlso try to make as many friends as possible and don't try to get into the mindset that you're trying to one up your classmates. Our first year was filled with many people trying to compete with each other and trying to put everyone down and those people dropped out. It isn't about how smart you are even if you think you're a genius. We had a self-proclaimed genius in our class who would constantly piss everyone off trying to convince us he was smart and he failed the first semester. College is a lot easier when you've got friends you can rely on for advice. Many of my classmates I graduated with are still good friends. College is about learning but it's also about making social connections",

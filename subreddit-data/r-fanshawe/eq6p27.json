They are really uncomfortably built. =/ Some classes have the ergonomic adjustable chairs that I try to snag if they're not reserved but... most don't, and every class is uncomfortable bordering on painful for me, if I'm there for 4 hours in a row, say.\n\nI love the location and the building, and my classes have been mostly great. But the chairs are the bane of my existence.",

So being in a class 4 hours straight with my back being bent over my laptop is super painful.\n\n Luckily all the class rooms I've been in have atleast one standing desk (sometimes 2)  that I can raise 1 or 2 more feet off the ground so I can save my back.",

Like clearly we're both on opposite ends of the height spectrum but... even people more in the average that I've talked to don't find them very comfortable.\n\nIt would be a pain in the butt but bringing something that could lift up your laptop might help a bit? I shove my jacket behind me to act like a makeshift backrest, if you had something under your computer it could raise it up.",

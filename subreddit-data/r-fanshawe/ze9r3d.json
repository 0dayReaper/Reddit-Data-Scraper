    "postText": "Greetings all! Registration just opened up on the 5th and I was notified that I was eligible to register for courses for my program. A few problems though... none of the courses in the program I am doing are listed online yet... (CPAP 3) As well, tried using the help/contact us through web advisor and it fails to load the page. Anyone else having trouble registering? Is their system not working properly or down due to excess usage? Not sure what to do so posting here in hopes someone can advise. Thanks!",

The only courses in the CPA program (that I am aware of) that you would need to pick would be your Gen Ed. Take a look at your schedule for 23W. Are there already courses there?",

Each term, the students gets split into sections (I'm section 3 rn, for example) and you get put into a specific timetable based on your section.\n\nThe only courses we get to choose (I'm CPA too) are the general electives, and the few courses we get a choice between, like choosing between COBOL or C++ graphics (COBOL was awesome, btw). That's later on in term 3 and after though, and I'm thinking you're accepted but haven't started term 1 yet?",

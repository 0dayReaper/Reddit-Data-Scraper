    "postText": "Got accepted into my 3 choices of programs and will be moving from Barrie to London in September with my best friend and I. We\u2019re going to need student housing and was looking at on campus housing but I found it pretty pricy for what we\u2019re getting. I just too a quick glance at foundry first and it seems amazing. New build with large suites that some have their own bathroom for less then $800 a month? Seems pretty good and walking distance to the college. Anyone currently in foundry first and have any opinions on it or how much they actually pay?\n\nThe floor plan the Collegiate 6x4 seems like the one we would like the most since there is a shared bedroom and a private bathroom for my best friend and I. This seems perfect and with 4 other people to make friends with is what we want\nhttps://foundryfirst.ca/floor-plans/\n\nDoes anyone live in this type of residence? How soon should we apply to get this floor plan? Should we avoid foundry first?",

            "comment": "I live in the shawe 4x3 right now.This is all my opinion, but..\nPros: It's not bad, rooms are avrage, good amenities, very close to all your classes.\nCons: if you don't get lucky with roommates your in for a nightmare - now that could be any where with Roommates - I myself had that problem when I 1st moved in. Although it is a non smoking building almost everybody in the building smokes and unless someone complains about a specific person there's nothing the staff can or will do about it, the only reason I got my problem roommate to go was because he agreed to moved when asked if wanted to go to another unit where people didn't care if he smoked compared to mine where everyone one did. That's not even scratching the surface with that nightmare of a roommate. Also paying $4.50 for a wash and dry of a load of laundry sucks - $2 for one $2.50 for the other. \n\nAll in all if you don't get unlucky, are out going or smoke and drink your self you should be fine, you have to book the place rather early to actually get the rooms you want because there is not to many of the room type you want like maybe 5 of them in the building. And I think it already at 80% filled for next lease term. That's all I can remember for now let me know if there anymore you want to know about. Goodnight and Goodluck.",

They have decent amenities including a gym, movie room, shared spaces etc. I also liked that it's across the street from the college, and a small plaza with a convenience store, pizza place, hair salon, etc. Food Basics only a 15 minute walk away. My roommates weren't horrible, so I'd consider my experience an overall positive one. A little on the pricer side, and they just keep raising the rent for new tenants every single year. It's grandfathered in though, so whatever price you have now will be the one you stay with until the end of your lease. Also, keep in mind that if you plan on moving back home during the summer, you'll have to get a sublet. If you do, just make sure to ask them as many questions as you can and make sure they know the building rules and will be able to get along with your roommates. I wasn't cautious enough with my subletter and he ended up being a disaster. Best of luck with whatever route you choose!",

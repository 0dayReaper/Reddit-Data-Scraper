A lot of people so far in my class have dropped out tho and I\u2019m planning on transferring elsewhere. It\u2019s a lot of work but if you enjoy math and science and are on top of your work you\u2019ll do great! They also have great labs too! In terms of the bachelor thing it\u2019s pretty much the same as a university bachelor.",

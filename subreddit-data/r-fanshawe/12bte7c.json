Our values are fundamentally incompatible. The amount of common ground we share has been getting thinner and thinner with each passing year as conservatives sprint at full speed to the far right end of the political spectrum. The end result is indirect violence against the working class and disenfranchised. The idea that I shouldn't judge or otherwise dismiss the opinions of people who support this shit is absurd. \n\n&gt;The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.\n\nI refuse.",

Which is by design. They never look outside North America, and this mentality is literally killing people. \n\nJust as one example, every single EU country gets 4 weeks of paid vacation to start. Yes, every single one, and that's only to start. Some countries give employees more than the minimum EU requirement. This means that a McDonald's worker in Czechoslovakia gets more vacation on their very first day of employment than your average Canadian does unless they've been at the same company for 10 years. \n\nCanadians are being absolutely screwed left right and center, and are completely unaware of how much better things are in our peer nations thanks to decades of propaganda pointing to how much better we have it than our neighbours to the south. The worst developed nation on earth.",

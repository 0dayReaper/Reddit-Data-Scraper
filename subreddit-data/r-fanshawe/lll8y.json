If you have any interest in video games or have friends, please come and tell them. The more people who come, the better deals we get on food and drinks. Message me for details, or if you'd like to help me! It is the weekend of Novemeber 18th. It'll be at Poacher's Arms.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=291841454173737",

You get what you pay for. Whether this is online or in person learning. Majority of the teachers are just workers in their industry looking for side income or have an interest in trying out teaching. They have no formal education in lecturing or teaching in general.\n\nTheir experience and qualifications range significantly. Some teachers teach well and are engaging and knowledgable in their field, while others read word for word from slides recycled from past teachers years before their time. \n\nI see not a lot has changed.",

It can be a positive having a professor that is working in the industry they are teaching because you can get real life experiences mixed into the lecture. Also, finding qualified, reliable candidates that can take time out of the work day to teach is not easy. \n\nI teach at Fanshawe part time and can tell you the quality of teaching can vary drastically. There is also little in the way of training and supervision (there is lots of material but many don\u2019t get paid to do the extra training - the professor has to be motivated for other reasons than money). So long as there aren\u2019t significant complaints about a teacher, they just keep getting contracts. That being said, there is the ability to have your voice heard through the survey, which I push my students to complete for better or worse. I can\u2019t become a better teacher if I don\u2019t get feedback.",

That's the issue with virtual learning and Fanshawe.\n\nLast semester, I... you know what, I explain everything about last semester [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fanshawe/comments/kcpvbx/opinion_how_fanshawe_has_failed_to_uphold_their/).\n\nThis semester? Well,\n\n* The teacher for my 5 hour class teaches only 2 hours. We were told to read chapters 1-3, where chapter 3 was discussed last week and this week. When a student asked \"are you able to cover chapters 1 and 2?\", the teacher responded \"**Sorry, we won't have time to do chapters 1 and 2. You'll have to read them yourselves**\".... I'm sorry, but let me break this down:\n   * Last week: Hour 1, introduction\n   * Last week: Hour 2. Chapter 3\n   * This week: Hours 3 &amp; 4, Chapter 3\n* By this logic, it'll only take you 3 hours to do Chapter 3. So let's say it takes you another 3 hours to do Chapter 1, and another 3 hours to do Chapter 2. Guess what happens when you add 1+3+3+3 together... IT EQUALS 10! In other words, we 1000% **WOULD** have time for it if you taught what you are supposed to teach, 10 hours over 2 weeks, not 4 hours!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Secondly, my other teacher just made videos from 2011 and we literally just watch them, and then that 3 hour class that got reduced to 1 hour a week is literally just a question and answer class.\n\nThis is bullshit. Fanshawe and the teachers are literally screwing over the students.\n\nWe aren't getting the hours of lectures we paid for, it's as simple as that. Fanshawe is in the wrong. The teachers are in the wrong. This entire industry is a joke from the pandemic and they're basically getting away with highway robbery.",

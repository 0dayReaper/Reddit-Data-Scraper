Majority are from average income households who have managed to save up enough for an international education, while some have enough money to just treat their 2-year college education as a vacation and spend the time and money accordingly. Depends on a lot of factors. \nI've seen posts here where some crib that their western nose is too sensitive to smells and deodorants should not be used in the corridors while I can see here that you want them to use it. So what is it? Just an FYI, It's highly increased in the Asian countries to mandatory bathe atleast once a day unlike here where people go days without taking a shower, especially the locals.",

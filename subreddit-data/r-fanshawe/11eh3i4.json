Classes aren\u2019t too hard as long as you pay attention, work hard on memorizing the police codes and the phonetic alphabet you\u2019ll need it. I liked everything but after a run in with a prof where he basically told me that if he was me he\u2019d drop out (bc i was struggling with my anxiety) i had to be done bc i could not be around that",

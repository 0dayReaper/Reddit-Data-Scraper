    "postText": "Hey buds! How does Fanshawe calculate your CGPA? \n\nDo they base it on the 4.2 scale? \n\nOr do they take your percentage average and assign a 4.2 scale conversion?\n\nI ask because I\u2019ve gotten 94-100% in all of my courses so far, but one of my classes is kinda dicey. Preparing for the worst to get somewhere between 85-89%.\n\nIf the cgpa is calculated by percentage, I should still finish with a 4.2. If they calculate by the 4.2 scale, then I\u2019d only get 4.18.\n\nI\u2019m gunning for A+ average scholarships at Kings/Brescia so I REALLY don\u2019t want to miss out on the highest $$ tier because of one class.",

            "comment": "It depends on the number of credits the class is worth. If the class is only worth 1 credit, it ain't hurt you as much as a class with 3 or 4.\n\nTake the number of credits the class is worth and multiply it by the gpa you got in the class. This will give you your Grade Weight Average.\n\nYou do this for all your classes on the semester, then addup your total Grade Weight Average and diving it by the total credits. This will give you your final GPA\n\nSo example for a class worth 3 credits where you got a B+ (3.5gpa)\n3 x 3.5 = 10.5 GWA\n\nExample for a class worth 1 credit where you get A+ (4.2gpa)\n1 x 4.2 = 4.2 GWA\n\nTo get your semester overall gpa, as the GWA totals, divided by the total credits, so..\n14.7 / 4 = 3.675 or 3.68 final GPA.\n\nThe course worth 3 credits affects your overall much more, so even though you got an A+ in the 1 credit class, it doesn't do much to help your overall.\n\nI hope this helps, any questions DM me. I have a pretty intense excel sheet.\n\nSorry formatting, did this on my phone",

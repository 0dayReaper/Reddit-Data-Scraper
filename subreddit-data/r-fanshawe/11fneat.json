A comment by FanshaweC here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fanshawe/comments/xutp52/comment/iqyp5il/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fanshawe/comments/xutp52/comment/iqyp5il/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) says it can be used anywhere on campus, but when I try to use it the workers just look at me weird and tell me they have never seen it before and don't even attempt to scan it or anything.",

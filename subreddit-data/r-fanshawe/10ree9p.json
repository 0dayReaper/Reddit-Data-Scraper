    "postText": "Hello, I recently got accepted into the 1 year Electrical Techniques program and the 2 year Electrical  Engineering Technician program for September 2023 intake at both Fanshawe College and St Clair College. I\u2019m not quite sure on which program to take my end goal is to get an apprenticeship in electrical and I have no experience in this field of work. I\u2019m also curious which school would be best for these programs?",

            "comment": "I'm currently enrolled in semester 3 of the electrical engineering tech program. I've had no previous electrical or mechanical background and I'm performing well and having a good time overall. The program itself is not easy and takes a lot of effort and investment into your work if you want to succeed. That being said, all but one of my professors were excellent and were very supportive. If you do plan on going forward with EMN2, come in with the mindset to learn. I'm repeating this because its not the type of program that you can just skate through without being familiar with the content. \n\nThere are some extra costs as well. The program kit that you'll need which has your tools and electrical components is about $500. The safety shoes that you'll need (buy a GOOD PAIR) will cost you about $100 + and you'll also need safety glasses. I think it's a great course and there's a lot to be gained from it as long as you make the most of what's provided to you - including asking your professors for help! Good luck man, I hope the decision you make is right for you.",

If your goal is to be in residential, agricultural or commercial, Techniques is more than adequate. If you wish to be in an Industrial (factory doing controls, PLC, etc.) or Power (substation, protection and controls, testing) I would say that Technician is a better bet. Technician gives a great background to how electricity works from a math/science view.",

Going into it, I was mostly interested in becoming an industrial electrician; turned out I did not like that field after learning about it but I discovered biomedical technology, through that program, and chose that career path instead.\n\nYou could definitely get an apprenticeship in electrical after getting your electrical techniques certificate.",

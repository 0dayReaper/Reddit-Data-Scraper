    "postText": "Hi there! So I was wondering if anyone could help me determine what my percentage grade is. I got a 3.920 last semester, and am trying to figure out what that would be in percentage out of 100% so i can better understand it, but the GPA system is a bit confusing (as that would make my grade high 70s/low 80s, which doesn\u2019t make sense with the grades I got). If anyone\u2019s able to help I\u2019d really appreciate it :)",

            "comment": "That's correct as far as I can tell? Fanshawe's GPA goes up to 4.2 which is an A+ grade, so 90-100. 4.0 is an A at 80-89, 3.5 is a B+ at 75-79, and so forth.\n\nIt's not a strict exact percentage, it scales differently because of the different bands. So 3.920 would be like 79%?\n\nWhat grades did you actually get? That would make it more clear.",

            "comment": "They don't respond or seem to give any sort of a shit. I have professors that hold zoom sessions and don't even teach anything. They just sit their silent while we do assignments. We are told that our lessons are the poorly put together slides full of grammar errors on fol that were written by someone else. Other professors just release instructions from previous semesters. Half our stuff says \"due October 2021\" or something like that. Course plans and modules are just empty templates. This was all raised to the associate dean, program manager and program coordinator. They do not care. They said \"sorry for your experience\" and that they would \"look into it.\" Nothing changed. Half of the students in the program emailed with the same concern. Nothing. I don't think anyone would pay for this program if they knew that they would just be reading slides online. You could get a better education at the library.\n\nOn strike without actually being on strike.",

One of my classes has open book tests, usually application questions with a few fill-in-the-blank questions pulled directly from the textbook. The professor is a notoriously bad speller, and often the test questions themselves will contain typos. Sometimes you cannot get the fill-in-the-blank questions correct even if you copy directly from the textbook because the professor has clearly made a typo when entering the answer and the question is impossible to get right. Online classes are incredibly frustrating if you have a lazy professor.",

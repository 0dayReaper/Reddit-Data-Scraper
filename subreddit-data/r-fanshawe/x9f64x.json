    "postText": "To provide some context, I\u2019m currently a 22M from a small town in South Carolina! I am transferring from Clemson University to Fanshawe College as an International student! \n\nMy only knowledge of Canada is mainly just my family that lives in Burlington, Newmarket, and Mississauga. I\u2019ve heard mixed things about London and I\u2019ve seen that Fanshawe is a fairly large school, but I wanted to come to the people first.\n\nWhat am I in for? Are the teachers chill? Are there decent parties students go to? And what\u2019s the best way I can go about networking with other students?\n\nThank you for your time :)",

Google the infamous Fleming Drive riots. \n\nNowadays I don't hear nearly as much about the party scene near Fanshawe or in London, but I must confess I'm a bit older and not really out there as much so I wouldn't totally know.\n\nFanshawe is a good school and it has become a very mutli-ethnic college which I find to be really nice. You will get to meet people from all over the world in your classes.",

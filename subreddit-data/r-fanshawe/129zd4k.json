I have some questions and it would mean the world if you could share your experience. I have questions regarding\n\na) the business program \n\nb) the electrical technician/technologist program\n\nc) residences\n\nand if you have any experience with any of these and would like to share I'd appreciate it so much. Please let me know and I will send you a dm:) Thank you in advance!",

Technician is good if u wanna be an industrial electrician or work in factory or sum it\u2019s decent.",

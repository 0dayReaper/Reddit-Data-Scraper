How and where can I find a place to stay? Or is anyone here looking for a roommate or know someone who is looking for a roommate next Fall? \n\nThank you in advance",

Then you can compare the commute distance from the property to your campus (Oxford/Downtown/South). Please check if you have ample bus routes available and you can then proceed with a video call with the landlord who can show you the property and the room. I suggest booking one before you reach here so one major thing is out of your way (since you have a lot of time). This is the method that I followed and it did work well for me.",

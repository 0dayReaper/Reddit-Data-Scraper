    "postText": "I looked at some posts and it seems like online courses suck for a lot of programs, anyone in landscape in recent years? I withdrew from uoft engineering last year as the stress and the rubbish online thing brought me mental issues. Took a year to overcome and switch to what I want to learn but I used to have a great starting point so I just cant stop worrying. Really want to know how is it to study landscape design here and especially the transfer to Guelph part after graduating (idk or maybe 2 years? )\n\nAlso really want to know is the neighborhood around Fanshawe by any chance safe? I'm asian and I live with a friend who would move to London with me, she's Russian so we both worry about hate crime or anything like that. \n\nAppreciate any info &lt;3",

I'm also Asian (born in Canada) but never experienced any kind of hate. I also lived on campus too, no problems.",

If you are walking in the neighborhoods near the campus,  you will totally fine during the day. If you are out at night, try to go with a friend or tell somewhere where you are going and when you'll be back. I've heard a few stories over the years of people getting mugged, but it's rare.",

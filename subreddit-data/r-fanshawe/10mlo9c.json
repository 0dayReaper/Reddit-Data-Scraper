    "postText": "I was a Fanshawe student some time ago, 10 or so years ago. I loved the noodle station at Oasis - I\u2019m heading back to London for work and really want to stop in and get some noodles just for old time sake. I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t as great as I remember them to be, but it\u2019ll mostly be a nostalgia visit. \n\nJust curious if oasis does still in fact have noodles and maybe even those giant belly buster cookies they once had. Or, if there are any other good campus food options you recommend, please share!",

    "postText": "What an absolutely atrocious program. I honestly could write a novel on all the sub-par situations, profs, labs, upper level faculty etc. There is no standards. Not a single person gives even the slightest shit with the exception of a couple profs. Looking for education with proper punctuation and grammar? Look elsewhere. There is so many spelling errors and run on sentences in the labs and slides, it is embarrassing. That is where we do most of our learning by the way. Slides. PowerPoint slides. We are still online despite being vaccinated, which they required of us in order to start the Winter semester, only to put us online and basically be forgotten about. I had a prof last semester that left class to go eat fucking grilled cheese. He just said it. \"I'm going to eat me some grilled cheeses\" and he peaced out. Some profs just release the same slides and content modules from previous semesters and don't even bother to change the dates. I have had activities due in 2021, while we are in 2022. I spend half of my time messaging profs to remind them that they have barely started their jobs, let alone finished them. What is this?! Why do the program coordinator, program manager, associate dean and so on, not care in the slightest? You just get the old \"we will look into this\" and nothing changes. The profs in question just end up teaching more classes the next semester with the same terrible effort. \n\nIt does not matter who you go to. They literally just don't care. I swear that all these profs need to sit in on a class with Cheri Aarts to learn how exactly to do your job effectively. The only one that treats us like adult humans and actually puts in immense effort. She is exactly what a professor is supposed to be. She doesn't belittle us for asking questions or struggling with concepts like the rest of them. Hell, some of them don't even read the chat in Bongo to see if anyone has had a question. \n\nAvoid this program. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT. You can literally get all this information online yourself (which is where the profs get it all) and not waste your time at a school that doesn't care about you. They have now increased the tuition for International students by over $2000 and force them to pay medical insurance even though they are online. They are paying almost 3-4 times what a Canadian student is paying and a majority of the students are International. They pay over $9000 a semester to get PowerPoint slides and minimal effort from their professors. This is so unbelievably shameful. Anyone who works for this school and knows that their students are paying $9000 and still don't bother, should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves as human beings.",

                            "comment": "Sorry for the wall of text but there is just so much wrong with Fanshawe's whole IT Wing that I can't just give a quick explanation. The CTN/CTY program is run and operated by individuals who couldn't give less of a shit if you learn anything. Most of the profs are a bunch of nimrods who couldn't cut it in the field and are just phoning it in for a quick paycheque. The higher-ups are more useless than tits on a bull and will frequently if not always blame any issues within the program on the student population rather than show any accountability or take responsibility for their mistakes. My final two terms in the program saw our entire Networking 3 course get torn into by the program coordinator and the profs for not \"understanding our fundamentals\" and \"not doing the homework\" in preparation for an exam they purposefully scuffed to try and screw over as many students as they could. From the base config they handed out to the marking rubric, everything about it was entirely fucked and when the few of us who had the stones to stand up to them called them out on it, rather than show some spine they just had us removed for being disruptive. It also saw my SQL Database course run by some schmuck Fanshawe had pulled off the street because they couldn't find a prof to run it. They only admitted to that however after we already tried to petition the college to can the course because shit had already gone way off the rails by the time mid-terms arrived, fought with the \"prof\" over his piss-poor ability to teach the content in question and watch other profs fight with him over final exam time slots because he scheduled that shit literally at the last moment. By the time the course was done, most of the people taking had bailed and there was maybe a dozen of us left. I think a total of two people wound up passing as they had said \"screw it\" and just started teaching themselves SQL and stopped coming to class. Even after all that, college didn't tell us shit until after the damage was done and when we all started clamoring for refunds and/or retakes they just told us \"tough shit, you're going to have to retake the course at full cost. It's your fault you failed.\" After all that and so, so much more I wound up leaving for greener pastures. The best advice I can possibly give you and any other poor sod who decided Fanshawe was a good place to learn IT is leave. Get out while you still can and go somewhere's else. Out of the 4+ years I spent in that shitshow I can honestly say I learned practically nothing and wasted thousands of dollars on a sub-par education that I would never see to fruition.",

That has nothing to do with your post but I wanted to point it out.  \nAs someone who has gone through this program i understand many of your frustrations. I will point out though that it is quite rude to go after someone for being ESL. It makes the matter worse when you complain about their punctuation, then try to create a patronizing post online about them, which is then poorly punctuated.  \n\n\nThis is how the whole world of IT works, you get things from the internet and learn it in written text. You think these people have time to create their own vulnerabilities, research, publish and then create lectures and labs??? Of course it comes from the internet.\n\nThe program is understaffed, that is no secret, there are no full time exclusive CYB staff anymore so nobody to create new content. Take that up with the associate dean.\n\nI think your point about Cheri Aarts is funny. She is the highest rated instructor on ratemyprof for the entire college, not just the school of IT. She also is a full time instructor, not part time like many of your others. This means she is more qualified and experienced. They cant get full time instructors because they pay garbage for wanting a Masters and preferring a PhD. \n\n$9000 is a standard tuition for international students.\n\nFinally, it seems like 99% of your complaints are about the staff. So it seems pretty unfair to say the program is bad when really you aren't complaining about the program only its administration.",

So you should not make those assumptions.\n\nThe most important point I would like to make is that the administration of the program directly represents the program itself. If the program is poorly administered, it is a poor program. \n\nAdditionally, all the staffing issues have nothing to do with me. I can not change that and explaining it the way you did doesn't somehow magically make the program any better. I am not the one offering a program staffed with part timers who don't care. I would not offer a program if I couldn't offer it properly. Taking anything up with the associate dean has no impact whatsoever, as I stated in my original post.\n\nThe point of my original post is that the program is a disaster. When yours profs do not care or put effort in, part time or full time, it makes for an awful experience. Somehow you find that disputable?",

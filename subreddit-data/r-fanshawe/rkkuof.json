    "postText": "I\u2019m getting really worried - I\u2019ve reached out to whoever I possibly can, but final grades are due tomorrow, from the professors. My professor has graded 35% of the final weight. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t have our midterm test mark, marks for an essay that was due a month ago, and a few discussion posts from the last two months. I\u2019m worried because, if he couldn\u2019t get these done in 4 months, how will he get them done in 24 hours? Has anyone ever experienced this before? What happened? I\u2019m in my final term, so I\u2019m now completely done, but I have to wait until my final grades are posted so I can request my transcript to send to university (I start in January).",

If no response, then associate dean. \n\nIf you don't like your grade on the latter assignments then challenge it in a grade appeal citing that you never received feedback and, therefore, could not improve.\n\nIf it goes that far you might miss your January start at uni. I'm sorry.",

I have 30 currently, and will receive 6 more from the final term, but those are based on mandatory courses not electives THANKFULLY. \n\nI have reached out to the professor and listed my concerns, and emailed back, as well as the entire class stating he would post a grade each day, however the last grade he posted was Thursday, and we JUST received the midterm test grade (literally 5 minutes after I wrote this!) \n\nI think I will email the program coordinator.",

They most likely marked it already but not in FOL and probably won\u2019t input all the grades there and just add grades manually to WebAdvisor based on their spreadsheet. They do it last minute so students don\u2019t email them complaining about the grades after the fact. Then you have to complain to associate deans or coordinators instead and go through a process to get the grade altered. It\u2019s a way that many profs do because they don\u2019t want to deal with students by email.",

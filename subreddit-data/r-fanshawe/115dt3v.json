            "comment": "It's kind of a trick question, kinda sorta?\n\nThe Levels refer to terms, so Aviation Tech there would be 4 terms total. Each term is 4 months (January-April, May-August, September-December) including exams.\n\nBUT, courses that are marked as Co-op will also have additional terms because of that. Like, my program was CPA (programming), and while we had 6 terms we also had 3 available terms for co-ops, so it was a 3 year program instead of 2.\n\nSo really it depends on the course. Usually if you go to the Fanshawe page for the specific program, it will explain in greater detail.",

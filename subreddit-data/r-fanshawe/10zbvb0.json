And from 8am start to 9pm end. There's no way to tell until the class schedules are released for your specific program.\n\nSummer schedule lasts from beginning of May to probably midway through August (for exams), that's the best we'll know. There's probably official start days on the Fanshawe calendar which you can google.",

During the semester, 2 of my 6 courses had professors switch out halfway through to accommodate union-mandated summer vacations. That being said, I didn't have any classes that ran past 4 p.m., but as someone already said, there are too many independent factors to accurately answer this question.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am in Pre Health Science now (Level 2). I would love to get into Nursing but it seems hard to get in (&gt;4.1 GPA). Also, it's really intense too as long as we get in. So I would consider applying to Pharmacy Tech Or Massage Therapy. I am pretty much more interested in Massage Therapy. Anyone gives me advice on what I should do after Pre-Health Science ;(.Is it hard doing Massage Therapy?",

Massage Therapy Accelerated (MSG2) is available, but one thing to keep in mind that it is an Accelerated class; you are going to be working for a 3-year advance diploma in 2 years. \n\nYou may or may not get a break in those 2 years. While the program I'm in is a 2-year diploma and is not considered an accelerated class, it could be considered \"accelerated\" because I have been in school since January 2022 without a (substantial) break. I will be graduating this April so that means about 15-16 consecutive months in school!  I can tell you right now that it is NOT easy to do an accelerated program and you do sacrifice a lot in order to be successful. \n\nIf you are thinking about going for the MSG2 program, I suggest you jump on it now before it fills up and you don't have an opportunity to apply.",

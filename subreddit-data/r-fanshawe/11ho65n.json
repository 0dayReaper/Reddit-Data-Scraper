A post-grad program allows for someone with a degree to re-specialize in another area (such as switching from biology to human resources) easily. However, it is not a masters and does not have the same standing as a masters. \n\nAlso, London is quite limited on jobs within the human resources field - you will want to look at larger companies within the GTA.",

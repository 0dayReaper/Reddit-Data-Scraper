    "postText": "I have no idea why, but I was under the impression that COMM was going to be a lot easier than WRIT... but I was wrong. I found WRIT to be difficult but I found the concept pretty straight forward. Read a short opinion piece each week and destroy their arguments in 5 paragraph essay format (and try to include good grammar). Plus The mods were pretty short and easy. But for COMM we have to rewrite an email to sound nicer plus read this long ass, difficult to understand, article, summarize it, then critique it. If it was just the re-writing the email thing it wouldn\u2019t be as bad, but the critiquing thing? I thought we already did this kinda thing in WRIT but this is like the harder version. Idk. I\u2019m having a hard enough time understanding nice email thing to also have to also try to think about criticizing someone. Along with my other courses I have to think about. And I\u2019m even taking a reduced course load! Maybe I\u2019m not cut out of college idk. But I don\u2019t know what the fuck I am cut out for\ud83e\udd20 k that was my rant good byeeee",

I know that sounds trite for having such a high GPA, but I was putting in 60+ hours a week to get that. Even so, I scraped a 90 on this course by a whisker. \nNot sure who your professor is, but I had Chris Chalmers. He\u2019s a tough marker, but also very helpful and responsive if you reach out to him.",

If I don\u2019t understand something I won\u2019t ask because I\u2019m too shy. If I do ask and they explain it and I don\u2019t understand I won\u2019t ask again cus I don\u2019t want to bother them again\ud83e\udd20 my mom\u2019s a teacher so she usually helps me.

Unfortunately I didn't get in due to having a D on one of the courses (we had an issue with the teacher and almost everyone in class got Cs and Ds) I checked the pathways to my program (SSW1J) and basically I have the following options [http://transferagreements.fanshawec.ca/Public/Search.aspx?pc=SSW1J&amp;inst=All](http://transferagreements.fanshawec.ca/Public/Search.aspx?pc=SSW1J&amp;inst=All)\n\nI want to try again next year before two year passes from my graduation. Any suggestions to improve my chances of getting into a Bachelor of Social Work program?",

If I\u2019m not mistaken, the fast track requires you to have no grade under a C so that maybe why. But couldn\u2019t you just apply for the regular program with your grades?",

I got a years worth of transfer credits, two of which counted as BSW prerequisites for applying to the BSW program at Kings. I still had to complete a year in a different, declared, major before being able to apply. I think (again, things may have changed) you could apply directly to the BSW at Windsor, but that\u2019s not how it worked at Kings. So, my advice is, apply for something, anything really, and then try the BSW again.",

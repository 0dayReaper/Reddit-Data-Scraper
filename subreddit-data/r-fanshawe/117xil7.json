            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m in it and can say it\u2019s really good, and everyone I\u2019ve spoken to about it says the same. Everyone who is currently in it have come from varying skill backgrounds (some have worked on movies, some have barely edited videos before) but everything we learn in class comes with tutorials that basically teach you from the ground up but don\u2019t impede you if you want to explore further. It\u2019s 5 classes a week that vary between 1-3 hours each, mostly in person but sometimes over Zoom, but the bulk of your school projects will be done on your own time. Schedules will vary every year but this year our classes have all been on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Hard to give an estimate given the fluctuation of projects per week plus the fact that people work at different speeds, but let\u2019s say that on average, this program will take up a total of 15-30 hours of your week every week. During your second semester, you\u2019ll be encouraged to pursue a VFX internship, or you can also choose to pursue a Capstone (a project of your own) and the wonderful profs are always there to help you out with anything you\u2019re working on or any questions you may have. Would highly recommend!",

If you are able to it\u2019s always better to take the co-op program than the regular, if needed you can drop the co-op component but I would strongly encourage not. \n\nI hire marketing students each term to help run Fanshawe\u2019s social media, and I get to know so many marketing students completing amazing co-op experiences that help them determine their career path and land their first post-grad job. \n\nEach one of the marketing students I\u2019ve hired or mentored would surely recommend the experience. I\u2019ll share this thread with them and let them chime in.",

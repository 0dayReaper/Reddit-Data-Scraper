The wait time is 5-10 mins.\n\nBetter to go to the office itself rather than just waiting for your confirmation.\n\nTold me that it'll take 3-4 days for my enrollment to be confirmed on the osap website. Not sure if I'm confident about it since I have applied for osap on February 2023 (When I went to the office itself).\n\nEdit:\n\nReceived confirmation for my enrollment less than a day.",

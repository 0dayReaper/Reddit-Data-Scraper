            "comment": "You will most definitely need the kit on the first day. The first year starts with a lot of traditional work then second and third year is mostly digital where you just need a sketchbook and basic drawing supplies. But I could be wrong because I graduated in 2019, not sure how much has changed. If I remember correctly, only 3 items I got went unused.\n\nIf you don't want to buy the kit, you can definitely buy most of the stuff through Curry's art store and Bijan's art studio. Avoid Micheals.",

Turns out you\u2019ll actually need and will be using most of the stuff in there ESPECIALLY the white and black boards for finals and mounting projects. It\u2019s mostly those and you will need the cutting board in there A LOT. The knife in there is gonna be your best friend. It\u2019s already going to be three months in and I\u2019m already low on the important things. You\u2019ll probably just get better bank for your buck buying the kit. It\u2019ll be difficult finding some of these things and it might even be more expensive. Although it\u2019s heavy, I don\u2019t regret buying it. Sure you\u2019ll have to replace your sketchbook and a few markers, inks, and the boards but I\u2019d say, buy it \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd",

Make sure you have the sketchbooks, pencils, pencil crayons and some good quality ink pens or markers and you'll be set. You will need the double sided tape and water colours eventually, but right now you won't. Just remember to ask your teacher what you'll need for the next class and bring it with you. Currys has great stuff and they give students a discount every day.",

Maybe I would\u2019ve at Michaels but I realize I\u2019d rather not have to go on a scavenger hunt to find each item when everything in that kit is at my disposal already, ready to go.",

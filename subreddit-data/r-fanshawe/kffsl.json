You've all made it to college, are you really going to tell me you don't understand an economic problem of this scale? Pay is not going to increase right now. It *shouldn't* increase right now, and if it does, it's going to contribute to this recession rather than help solve it. What we need to do is let things stagnate a bit, and hopefully cut back on costs, not drive them upwards. \n\nIf you start paying your support staff more, the college is then going to charge you more for tuition and probably tack on other fee's as well, do we really need that right now?\\* In fact, I'm willing to bet those support staff make a really decent wage right now in comparison to people who do a lot more important work. This is like the fucking bus drivers making upwards of $40/hour to *drive a fucking bus*. You simply have to sit, and drive. That's nearly $100,000 a year! What kind of fucking backwards, fucked up society we are that we pay bus drivers $40 an hour, and nurses less? \n\n**tl;dr** If everyone would get their heads out of their asses and realize these people need the jobs more than Fanshawe needs them this would be over rather quickly. I've had enough of unions destroying our fucking economy already, it's time to put them to rest once and for all.\n\n*Just so you know the average student debt in Canada is [around $25,000](http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/canada/archives/2010/01/20100129-121950.html) and that's not taking into account any personal debt which most people hold a lot of in lines of credit and credit cards.",

During the recession it's up to the government to get us out by spending, hiring more people etc. to get the economy moving. When we're riding high at the crest of a wave, sure that's when the government spends less... you don't get in a rut and just lie down that's not how you get out of it.\n\nAlso, bus drivers make ~$25 an hour not $40.\n\nAlso you might want to check your reading comprehension skills\n\n&gt;The proportion of students with heavy debt loads of $25,000 or more rose to 27%, up from 17% in 1995, StatsCan said.\n\n27% is not a majority. \n\nHonest question, how would your view of this situation change if you've finished college and now your job is on the chopping block to be replaced by part time temp workers? Would you still have the same \"Ah fuck them we're in a recession, the only way out of this is to do nothing\" attitude?\n\nLike I said, it's shitty that they've taken to striking. It shouldn't have gotten this far. They're not bad people for wanting wage increases that account for the fact that cost of living is also increasing and wanting to know they'll be employed in a year.\n\nYou can toss that anti-union sentiment too. Unless you like working weekends, and more than 40 hours a week, and not having holidays off or lunches or breaks. What about being paid in scrip instead of actual money? Would you like that? Every other thursday getting a slip that said \"500 Credits no cash value\" and you can only spend it at the company store? It seems the only people who are anti union are the ones who don't realize everything we've got because of them. ",

We all contribute to the economy. It's this mentality that \"oh, the government will clean it up\" that's helped push us here in the first place. Citizens have been spending themselves into stupid amounts of debt for nearly 20 years. It has to end somewhere and it's not the governments responsibility to clean up anyone's financial pile of shit should they so choose to pile up debt.\n\nI never said anything about \"do nothing\" in regards to the recession, but stagnation is a hell of a lot better (better in a sense of economic stability) than a knee-jerk spending reaction like the US has done. When a crash as hard as this hits, the best thing to do is to take things slow and steady, not instantly throw ourselves into more debt and hope for the best.\n\nHonest answer, I am done college. Welcome to the *real world(tm)* where everyone is replaceable. No one can hide the fact that the reality of most of these peoples' jobs is that it's incredibly low-skilled work that can be trained in a few minutes/a day maximum. This puts them in an incredibly vulnerable positions. My job won't be replaced with a temp worker, I have experience most people don't get in 5-6 years. \n\nI really wish Canadians would wake up and look at what unions have done to destroy this country, and the US. What have we acquired from unions? Higher wages which allow everyone to borrow more money and slam themselves into debt? Or how about the number of companies we've straight out lost due to outsourcing? How many people are out of work because of the unions in the manufacturing industry? The majority of our large companies don't even operate as Canadian companies anymore. It seems like the only people who enjoy unions are living in a fantasy world where everyone is always treated fair and just, and everyone's job is the most important thing in the world. \n\nWake up, we don't live in a utopia. Some jobs are worth more in weight than others. Some people literally have jobs because we simply haven't had the time to replace them with more efficient processes.  I have no sympathy for people who haven't done anything with their lives in 20-30 years and worked the same job with nearly 0 skill level and then expect to do anything useful when that job disappears. We have more access to education than most countries in the world, and a huge chunk of our population pisses it away by either studying useless meta-bullshit or they simply don't study anything at all. I don't have sympathy for those who take the easy ride in life and then expect to be treated like they're useful. Again, take responsibility for your own destiny, I can't stand the sense of entitlement that the 17-20-something generation has right now. ",

Government spend can come in one of two forms: \n\n1) Stimulus or 2) Tax cuts. It's really up to voters which they prefer at any given time.\n\nDuring recession, government is supposed to accrue debt to maintain the standard of living, and then after the recession when things are up and running again, they pay down the debt. On an individual level, it works in much the same way. \n\nThe major problem with that right now is that during our high-earning and producing periods at the turn of the century, everybody was still accumulating debt. Maybe high schools should teach a mandatory budgeting class, because pretty much the entire middle class and the political parties they elected ran up debts like it was nobody's business. Then when a Prime Minister came along who wanted to put more money towards debt reduction rather than increases to social services, that same middle class broomed him. \n\nI have to say though, the recession is the primary reason that it is inappropriate for the union to ask for more money right now. The fact is, lots of businesses are shutting down, which means the province -which pays for roughly 75-80% of Fanshawes budget - is collecting less corporate tax from businesses that have shut, and less income tax from the newly-unemployed. If the province has less money, and provincial employees demand a raise, there are only two ways to give it to them;\n\n1) cut services and reallocate or 2) raise taxes.\n\nNeither of those things are worth the effort to pay a bunch of whiny, over-aggressive, entitled workers who are on good salaries already a raise. It makes no sense. \n\nIf I'm getting a tax increase, it had better be to pay for essential services or to get Ontario into a better position for the new industries that will be emerging over the next decade, and not dime-a-dozen college service staff. On the other hand, I do not accept that it's fair to cut anything from education, healthcare, social assistance (you know, for the truly needy?), or infrastructure to give a raise to the college staff. \n\nThese people were offered 4.5% over the next three years with back pay. In this job market that's like finding a bar of solid gold on the sidewalk.\n\n/rant",

That means that we will be in effect rendering other individuals' jobs redundant, or reducable to part time. That's how progress is going to work for the next while.\n\nThis is the start of the digital age, and very few people seem to want to accept that every single facet of our society will have to change as a result. This is one of those paradigm shifts, like the Agricultural or Industrial Revolutions.\n\nNothing short of a complete restructuring of the way society works will allow the people who do basic tasks to survive.

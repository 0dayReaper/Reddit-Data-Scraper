    "postText": "I am applying to the cyber security program at fanshaw but I got a declining letter with the reasons stating that I don't have grade 12 university math.\n\nI graduated high school back in 2007. Out of high school I applied to Fanshawe's computer programming analysis course and completed it and then went to UWO for another course. It's been a couple years and I thought I would like to flesh out my knowledge with cybersecurity so I applied. I'm pretty sure I applied as a mature student so it's weird that I'm being declined for not having grade 12 math despite graduating more than a decade ago and also already having completed a math heavy course at fanshawe.",

I recently looked myself to go from Fanshawe to University from the CYB program. Mature students were defined as someone who never attended post secondary education for university, and must not have a OSSD or GED for colleges BUT must still meet course requirements. I\u2019d recommend following up with the registrar. As for your math taken at Fanshawe acting as a replacement, I don\u2019t think they would. I took Calculus as an elective at Fanshawe but other schools don\u2019t recognize it because it\u2019s not government curriculum like in high school. \n\nhttps://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/apply/mature-students",

I do recall taking college level grade 12 math and I don't remember the exact mark But I do recall it being in the high 80s. I'll follow up with the office of the register because I'm wondering if there's just been a misunderstanding. Thanks",

    "postText": "So for context, I\u2019m currently a grade 12 student. I got an acceptance offer in mid December which I accepted at the beginning of January. Digitally I\u2019ve been confirmed but I\u2019ve heard NOTHING else. No letter acceptance, no \u201cregistration package\u201d, no information. I have no clue and honestly it\u2019s making me really anxious. Just wondering if anyone else is having this issue, knows why, or just anything that\u2019ll give me more info for what\u2019s up. \n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "Fanshawe is better then the full western but wouldn\u2019t recommend it over other school \n\nI\u2019ve heard they switched some first year classes to be back in person but second year is fully online with the exception of lab sim and one HPC course. Once you get to western it\u2019s completely online. \n\nYou take online phys with western 1st year then o line pharm and path with western second year. \n\nI absolutely would recommend you going somewhere else. I got into to Trent as well and I regret not going there wonderful program right into a placement in the 1st year which western you don\u2019t go until 3rd year. Brock would be great too I\u2019ve heard they are very hands on",

            "comment": "Hello,We were able to connect with Kaitlyn, one of our fourth year collaborative nursing students, here is what she had to say.I would recommend the program. I am in my 4th year and enjoying it. London is a great city to complete the program because it is a major health-hub for all of Ontario and there are some really amazing placement opportunities. As a student, you get to learn in some of the best teaching hospitals in the province. I found the Fanshawe streamline to be better than the straight Western program because you get an extra placement in second year and more lab experience with smaller group numbers.They are currently changing the structure of the program. From my experience, I completed the first two years of the program during COVID so almost all of my classes were online. Based on the new proposed structure, 1-2 classes will be online for second, third, and fourth year. Some classes will remain online in upper years in order to offer more placement opportunities.\n\nThere are no classes at Western in years 1 and 2. You will have to write some exams at Western during exam period because they are all collaborative classes and Western offers a larger writing space. During years 1 and 2 at Fanshawe, you complete the same classes that are offered at Western, they just have a different course code. You are classified as a Fanshawe and Western student during your first and second year. In third and fourth, you transition to Western campus for your last two years.\n\nI got accepted at various universities and colleges for the program and I am happy I chose Fanshawe-Western. There are downfalls at every university and things you won't like about each program, but I have found the program to meet my needs as a nursing student. I know someone who graduated from Trent nursing, and they enjoyed their time there, however they had less placements and less opportunities. I would say consider what you want out of the program (placements vs. theory classes vs. closer to home) and make your decision off your needs!",

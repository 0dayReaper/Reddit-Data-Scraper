    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m starting ECE in the fall and opted for the online option as I live a few hours away. I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any insight in to the program. Is it asynchronous or synchronous? And how many hours are the placements in the last 3 semesters? Like is it 1 day a week or multiple?\n\nThank you!\ud83d\ude0a",

You have to reach a certain amount i believe it\u2019s 21 days (forget the amount of hours!) of placement to complete it.  There\u2019s also a workbook to complete as well during placement.  Since you\u2019re online I\u2019m not sure if these will be different. Most classes are synchronous but some are asynchronous.  The program in my opinion could definitely use some work as there as many many repetitive activities and lessons.  Lots of reading articles, answering questions doing group assignments and independent assignments.  Profs are decent but most are part time and often not available as they have another jobs or are in full time school themselves.  Overall, I\u2019m glad to be almost graduated and start my career.  Best of luck to you!",

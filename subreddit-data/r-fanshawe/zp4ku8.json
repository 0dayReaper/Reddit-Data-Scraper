    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo I am currently taking PreHealth at Fanshawe college, and while the program is not too hard itself, I struggled to adjust to the program as I haven't taken an exam in awhile post pandemic. After the midterm and final exam, I managed to pass all my classes but I am not so proud of my grades. I really want to get into the collaborative nursing program. Can I make up for it in semester 2? or do they only look at my semester 1 grades? I've been doing a lot of reflecting and re-evaluating on my priorities and what I can do differently for semester 2. Can anyone breakdown how they check grades for getting into uni? thank you.",

I\u2019d recommend contacting Ashleigh Sutherland - she was great at guiding me through prehealth from start to finish \n\nhttps://www.fanshawec.ca/students/support/academic-support/advisors#undefined\nHer contact info is under school of health sciences",

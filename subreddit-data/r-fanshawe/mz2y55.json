    "postText": "**DISCLAIMER**: This post is written from my personal experiences within the program. Every experience is unique to the individual and so what I have written below should not be taken as gospel by those looking to apply or who have already applied to the program. \n\nThis isn't from the perspective of a student who slacked off all year. This is from a student who dedicated each hour of the day to the program and its educators. \n\n# Where shall we begin?\n\n# 1 - The \"Educators\"\n\nThe professors in this program, excluding 2, do not care about you, your success or your understanding of the content. During my first semester, one professor blatantly told his students that he would not read any chats. This resulted in him continuing on with the lecture while students were confused on previous topics. If you think that's bad, trust me, there is worse. The \"professor\" in charge of teaching Linux in first semester and Windows in second semester is notoriously known for replying to student's emails weeks after they are sent and does not publish any grades until a day prior or after the exam. This professor is the same one who does not read any of the assignments nor the lecture content given to students. They are continuously condescending to any student who dares ask for help on clarifying a concept. All this while they themselves hardly understand said concept enough to be teaching it.\n\nThey have been caught twice plagiarizing content found on LinkedIn Learning. You can argue: \"If it works, why re-invent the wheel?\", however, this is not sound logic. The problem here is that the content is very minimal as LinkedIn Learning professors normally clarify the concepts vocally. This professor fails to do the same and decides to just copy and paste, line for line,  the minimal information that LinkedIn Learning professors put on their PowerPoint presentations. One more thing to note here is that the student is paying twice (if not more) the money for this course than what it would be offered for on LinkedIn Learning.\n\n# 1.1 - Lack of Passion\n\nAs I mentioned above, many of these professors are part-time workers who are treating this job as a stepping-stone into something better or simply as another source of income. That is fine until it results in the person putting in less effort and passion into the job. Professors must remember that their students only get as much out of their course as they put into it. It is a two way street.\n\n# 1.2 - Program Coordinator\n\nAs the coordinator of the program, you are expected to maintain the integrity of the program and those in charge of educating the program's courses. You are also expected to do the best you can for the students as without them, you wouldn't be holding the job. The program coordinator has unfortunately forgotten this. They continuously mock students in emails and during the lectures they teach, painting students as teenagers who have no clue what they are talking about. A notable portion of students in this program are in their 20s, so you can imagine how unfounded this sort of approach is. They fail to take constructive criticism and instead bathe in their own ego by telling the students that they will never take anything said by them seriously. This is extremely worrying as students are the ones paying thousands of dollars to attend this program. Students deserve to be heard and be taken seriously, period.\n\n(By the way, the program coordinator is also married to one of the professors. How is this not a conflict of interest?)\n\n# 2.0 - Testing\n\nThe professors purposely fail to properly prepare students for success.  It is a common occurrence that students receive perfect grades on assignments and perform poorly on midterm and final exams. This is very confusing as the content in those assignments would have to be reflected in the tests too, right? Among that, one professor has admitted that exams are written with the intent of weeding out students.  I understand that they are desiring the best of the bunch but if that was truly the intent, why keep the program's pre-requisites minimal? This is an Advanced Diploma program. The prerequisites should not only be a college math &amp; English credit attained in Highschool. You are effectively robbing student's money. You are doing this by allowing them to enter a program that presents complicated tech concepts all while knowing they have no background in the field. And for the cherry on top, you are then purposely weeding them out via exams.\n\nA massive flaw with online theory exams is that the student is not allowed to view their exam after completing it. It is baffling how you, as an educator, can expect your students to do better while you are denying them their request to learn from their mistakes. A person cannot intellectually grow without knowing how &amp; where they went wrong. This is common sense.\n\nYou may be saying to yourself: What they say makes sense, why aren't students allowed to see their exam and learn from their mistakes? The reason is as simple as professors preferring to re-use past exams rather than update them for each semester. A student's success is risked because of the laziness of the educators. Imagine that.\n\n# 3.0 - Conclusion.\n\nOverall, this program is not worth the money spent to attend it.  The professors and coordinator lack passion to teach the courses and the drive to see their students succeed. They disregard you as you are paying thousands for a decent education and refuse to take what you say seriously. A notable majority lack any teaching experience and treat the job as a hobby. To anyone considering applying to this program, know this: The college and this program's educators are money first and your education second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo any professors of the program or Fanshawe staff reading this: Take this as constructive criticism. Do not pass this off as a \"student complaining\". If you do so, you are only proving my point.",

You're always going to run into people you don't like, profs are no different.  The passion mentioned by OP has to be yours.  You can't rely on other people to inspire you.\n\n/u/Cowhugger64 said the following:\n\n&gt; I understand your frustration, I really do, but this was not an appropriate way to voice your concerns, just the same as your teachers will not respond politely when they feel ambushed in front of the class with criticisms.\n\nI'm right there with you.  Of course I had profs I didn't like.  The important thing is to approach them professionally.  Posting a STRAIGHT UP RANT on Reddit isn't going to get anything done.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe you approached OP's bullshit with far more respect than it deserves.  It's a shame that well thought out, level headed responses get downvoted.",

We had one that was by-day, in the highest position you could be in this field and by-night taught a course. Let me say, just because you are an expert or excel in your field of work, does not make you an effective teacher. period. His class was a massive struggle for all the students. \n\nI will say the testing stuff does make sense to me. Is it right? no, but that's how most colleges work. They are generally teaching the same material each year so why would the exam need constant updating? Maybe the tech aspect changes that logic, but for my program it's basically the same material for the most part. Our profs. made themselves available via request by private zoom meeting. They would go through lost marks on tests/exams for each student but it required us to set up a meeting. We were never given access to a completed test and only shown were we lost marks specifically. \n\nFrom a few posts I've read on here, it seems like a lot of these tech based programs just don't translate well to online learning or maybe they never really were that good to begin with? That's really too bad about your experience, will you continue on with the program or look elsewhere?",

This pattern is consistent with many others who have done the IT programs. Some students figure it out sooner than others, and some later on. It's then you realize Fanshawe is a business, a very lucrative business.\n\n\n\nSome program offices are better than others. I know staff there who say the school of IT is very difficult to work with. Counselling staff have a hard time with students who need accommodations and they get a lot of pushback from the school of IT. They can't enforce accommodations, only make suggestions so when the school of IT fails to work with students with a disability, it's up to the student to appeal and challenge the staff. The process is very time-consuming and it causes a lot of students to drop out when they can't get the help they ask for.\n\n\n\nIMO it's the attitude at the top of the school of IT that needs to change from one that's careless to one that focuses on student success. By careless I mean there are huge class sizes at the beginning of a program and by the end, there's only a handful of students who make it to graduation. A caring admin would take this seriously and remedy the problem. I believe if there was more invested in the quality of the content and how it's delivered then you would see many more students stay motivated through the entire program.\n\n\nFanshawe has other programs with staff who sincerely care about the student's success. The program content is exciting and draws the student into the topics they teach. Staff elaborate on learning points and they really go the extra mile to help students who need it. The teaching staff are like this because they have support from the admin who encourages a positive environment. I was in another program at the college that was like this and then I took some classes at the school of IT later on and it left me wondering what the hell happened. I value what I learned at the college many years ago but after my time at the school of IT, I'm feeling ripped off and I honestly regret going there. They have failed a lot of us who gave it a chance. I invested a lot of time into my classes and most of that was finding better content online that the college failed to provide.\n\n\nThere's so much more I could elaborate on but I'll leave it there. Just know you're amongst many others who had to navigate the toxic environment at the school of IT. I hope all is well going forward.",

For example, anyone with an anxiety disorder is already suffering to a larger degree because of heavily weighted assessments.\n\nIt's [well known](http://udloncampus.cast.org/page/assessment_udl) in Universal Design for Learning policy that it is best for learning to ensure that students are being tested for actually course relevant topics and in different ways so that the learner can actually portray their abilities and not be limited by a specific construct (such as hand-writing coding exams only) or their ability to adapt to the enforced testing environment.\n\nUDL is even mentioned as a [Teaching Core Competency](https://www.fanshawec.ca/teaching-and-learning/professional-development/teaching-expectations-core-competencies) on Fanshawe's website.\n\nIt's not easy to apply UDL, but it's more and more apparent to me that many issues that *everyone* is facing today would be solved if UDL principles were enforced and required to be audited every semester. Everyone would be better off to cope with any disruptions due to disability or otherwise.",

As someone further in the program who has designated a lot of time and money to this program I feel justified to respond.\nWhile I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily wrong on points, I do think you should be aware of somethings.\nPrerequisites- you\u2019re in a community college. If you speak to Dan or Karen they will tell you as they told my year many times, they tried to make grade 11 computer engineering and computer science mandatory but can\u2019t as they are electives that not every school runs. On the program page it says they are highly recommended.\nSeeing as you weren\u2019t aware of that, I will also share that the teachers consistently tell us that they are there to give you a basic understanding of the concepts and it is your responsibility to further educate yourself to gain a deeper level of knowledge. \nYou need to also take into consideration that the reason that there are so many part time teachers is not because they aren\u2019t trying to find people but because nobody applies. They literally had a full time teaching position for this program open for a year. Nobody applied. Why would they apply to a $80k a year start when they are making $110 starting in the field? \nDon\u2019t get me wrong I believe the program has its flaws too and that it\u2019s able to be criticized. You\u2019ve hit a couple of the common points. I previously had trouble that the teachers would say \u201cif you can\u2019t understand this then you\u2019re not cut out for this field\u201d but after my first co-op I realized, they were right. CyberSec is not a field you can just sit in classes for and then get your piece of paper and job. You actually have to spend the time to research trends and dive deeper into the content. \nIf you are a 2020/2021 intake, know that Dan and Karen only teach the first three semesters and you will only have part time instructors and Mansour beyond. I\u2019m sorry about the experience you\u2019re having, a lot of the things I have said, they would have said to you on your orientation day in first year. \nI am curious to know who this instructor who won\u2019t read chat is?",

You are of course entitled to challenge what I've written, especially with your greater experience and time spent in the program. Know that I have no intention of sparking an argument with you but that I have my own thoughts on some of the points you made.\n\nPrerequisites -\n\nUnfortunately that is the case about Computer Science &amp; Computer Engineering, but as someone who did take Computer Engineering in Highschool, I can tell you that the content taught then and the content taught in this program do not sync one bit, with the exception of programming skills. My point here is that this is an Advanced Diploma program that is constructed for post-graduates while at the same time allowing students who have little to no experience with any of the content taught in any one course.\n\nContent -\n\nI don't feel the argument that students must dive deeper on their own time is a good defense for the professors. Students paid thousands of dollars to get all the information, not only some. If the argument is that they should spend their own time researching more about the content, then why attend the program at all? What are the professors there for?\n\nStudents might as well self-educate and avoid the costs if they are only receiving half an education. The educators are supposed to be there to prepare you for the field and only providing half the knowledge required for said field questions their very purpose and the cost the student takes on to attend the program altogether. Maybe I am being na\u00efve, but I would think that you're entitled to a full education when you're spending thousands of dollars for one.\n\nPart-time Teachers -\n\nI have heard many times that teaching positions are very hard to fill, in any program. My point about this is not to dismiss the idea of part-time professors but to highlight the lack of effort and passion they are putting into the job. Part-time or not, my point still stands:  \"Professors must remember that their students only get as much out of their course as they put into it. It is a two way street.\".\n\nI will avoid naming any professors. They know who they are if they come to read my post. I have no ill wills to any of them as a person, my concerns are solely about them as educators of the program.",

                            "comment": "Hey, this time my post will be formatted as I am not laying in bed half asleep.\n\nThe point with the discussion about prerequisites is not that they shouldn't exist. I also took both grade 11 &amp; 12 comp sci and eng. In all four classes i carried a 90% and received the award my graduating year for the highest on record for the school. My first midterm was Operating Systems. I got a 42%... Clearly I am aware there is a gap in between the high school level class and a college class. I think it's also good to mention here that if they wanted  to provide a easier entry they would have to make the program longer, which they simply can't do. A certificate is a single year, diploma is two, advanced diploma is three and a degree is four. CYB is already 10 semesters long for September intakes and so they cant make it any longer without losing content which will become important when you choose your specialty or major or focus or whatever you want to call it. So if you want to say that this program needs to become a degree, then i am 1000% on board with you.\n\nAs i mentioned before this is a massive field, you will eventually pick a focus that will become your career. They again dont have enough time we barely scratch the surface of many focuses because they again, are already at the maximum amount of time allowed. They only get on average three hours a week for each course in that time they need to review the previous week, teach new concepts and run a activity to give you a practical idea of what it is you are doing. So the onus to fill those gaps ultimately falls on us as students. The reason we dont self educate to begin with is that you go to Fanshawe to have the credibility for employers to recognize. Same reason you will do certification tests. Posts like these however, when a employer hasn't heard of the program before and this is what they see, destroy the credibility of both the school and the program which further diminishes you, me and everyone else whos taken it. I understand your frustration, I really do, but this was not an appropriate way to voice your concerns, just the same as your teachers will not respond politely when they feel ambushed in front of the class with criticisms. I have given criticisms to literally every instructor in the program and they genuinely do take that advice because I waited until it was just us and posed it as a conversation. Just the same as this, I don't think you're wrong but I wonder if there is a better way to do this.\n\nInstructors, this is just something that bugs me. They aren't professors, professor is a term reserved only for individuals who have successfully completed their PhD.\n\nAnyways the school does care about their instructors in this program in particular! There have been several teachers who have been let go previously for not following procedures that the college has made. My parents used to be part time teachers at different colleges but they are a ministry and unionized so a lot of the same applies. They only get paid for the hours they are teaching. Being a part time teacher is a crummy job. So it easily becomes a side hustle with little regard as the pptx is already created. It doesn't excuse people from doing less then that but its hard to hold them accountable when we dont actually know their job description and requirements. \n\nThe only reason I asked about which instructor was not reading chat is because I can think of three that if they saw anything that gets them off track, good luck getting them back. Online is rough for everyone, not in the same ways but everyone has their struggles and it is not our place to compare our own to theirs. \n\nFYI; I don't see this as a argument. I am trying my best to stay as civil and open minded as possible just as I see and can appreciate you are too. So thanks.\n\nPS: I would be interested to hear back from you and welcome it. I dont want to publicly shame anyone here but this might be of value to anyone in this program.\n\nThe program is time demanding. I would spend 40-45 hours a week on classes, notes and labs. Testing weeks I spend around 60 hours a week. I carry around a low 80 average. I think your numbers should be similar but this is only here so you can reflect on your own habits as everyone is different.",

                                    "comment": "Hey. Appreciate your response. I do agree that there simply isn't enough time allocated for the instructors to cover everything we need to know. It still begs to question: Is it still a fair deal? The amount of money paid by students and the quality of the program and quantity of information given in exchange. \n\nI understand that making posts like ones I have diminish the integrity and credibility of the program and the school but I don't feel that is an excuse to let all the concerns I mentioned in my original post slide. Accountability of the school's staff is just as important as their credibility. I resulted to making this post as many of our concerns in emails written to the program coordinator and various instructors have fallen on deaf ears or just blatantly mocked by the professor and the coordinator in front of our peers during a lecture. \n\nBeing told by your program coordinator that anything you say as a paying student will not be taken seriously is very concerning and should never be the approach or the attitude of a program coordinator or instructor. Believe me, myself and others have tried the one-on-one approach various times and have been ignored or just out-right dismissed. We were also told by one instructor in first semester that he expected all of us to fail his midterm exam because that's been the result every year. It is the job of an instructor to encourage his/her students to succeed and doing this reinforces the opposite.\n\nAs far as the move to the online format, I feel this is a tired excuse. They've been given the time to adapt and seeing as they are educating a Cyber Security course, they should be familiar with an online environment.\n\nTo your time allocated to studies, I would agree that I had to to the same. I would be in school from 10am - 10pm everyday, taking notes on the lectures, reviewing them, and completing the assignments. I finished the first semester with a 3.8 GPA. Yes, you can find academic success in this program but I don't believe it should require complete abandonment of a social life and hobbies. I don't doubt that a drive to work hard and have a strict work ethic is required to succeed. The concern is that if a student must spend every hour of their day understanding the content then it would mean that the instructor missed the mark on clearly presenting it.",

You will be looking for a Co-op this fall along with your classmates and believe me, the employers have NO IDEA what cyber security is. I was asked in every interview what it is we do. Employers will see this post, I know because I met one who has a post by someone named diablo. I am not going to tell you that you should delete it. That's your decision. If I were you, I would keep this up for probably until tomorrow morning when it will have lost all traction and then remove it so you eliminate the backlash. At the bare minimum I would revise it with the things we have discussed and definitely change the title to be more specific of what it is you're critiquing. You don't want to be the reason that someone doesn't attend this september because you scared them or say the whole program is bad when at this point it really is a debate of customer service.\n\n  \nNo customer service is not their forte. I don't want to even talk about that because I agree. I am curious if you dont want to say names, which class did \"everyone fails midterm, every year\"? Cause This is a common tactic that they use in first year often (its not true, its to get you to study harder and show investment) First year in almost any program is rough and they do try to weed people out because they want you to know if this is content you are interested in before you're so invested that you cannot switch.\n\nI will also say, it gets easier. Don't sweat it. First year is hard but you get passed and then everything becomes easier and less time demanding. I can't really speak to your peers or yourself really but I believe you put in your best effort. I however would take what people in your class say with a grain of salt unless you have some evidence. People tend to exaggerate and say that they are trying there best while they might not be. To be more specific Dan used to say that come second semester everyone who sits in the backrow would be gone. He was correct, they were. Those people never stopped complaining about how difficult it was and how hard they were trying. They came to class everyday from a party. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally I would just want to tell you that the \"program coordinator\" position has very little responsibility. They basically create the learning outcomes and that is all. They have no impact on staffing for the program unfortunately. So if you choose to revise your statement I would very much consider not directing it towards CYB in particular but rather Administration. A lot of this is their responsibilities and the program itself is not to blame but the way you have phrased a lot of this very much throws the curriculum under the bus. I am still curious to know which classes midterm is apparently ungodly difficult...",

I do feel my points within the post itself still stand as what I wrote does address the experiences that I truly had in the program thus far..\n\nIn regards to the midterm exam, the class it was for was Cyber Security.\n\nTo your comment about instructors using the \"I expect you all to fail my exam\" to encourage students to study harder, I can assure you that it isn't effective. This can be worded a whole lot better. An instructor can comment on the difficultly of their exam without belittling the intellect of their students.\n\nAs far as the role of a program coordinator, it is a shame that they hold very little responsibility if that is indeed true. Regardless, I don't feel that the approach of mocking students and blatantly telling them that what they have to say holds no value is justified in that position, or any position in education for that matter.\n\nYes, there are always students who do not put in the work and complain about the program, however, these concerns that I have are, for a fact, shared among students who are putting in the effort to succeed.\n\nI agree that the first year of any program tends to be the hardest and that is reasonable when it comes to the workload and understanding of new concepts but I also believe that it isn't a great practice to throw on top everything else we have discussed on first years. The first year of the program should be a challenging but encouraging environment, not one that's challenging and also discouraging.\n\nAdministration is just as much at fault but as a student who primarily converses with the instructors and the coordinators, my concerns are from those interactions.\n\nEdit: Turns out I am unable to edit the title of the post. I understand it could have detrimental side effects. I do think it brings attention to the attitudes and approaches of the instructors which should be held accountable. The post will likely be taken down once it becomes buried or at the very least revised in the beginning to clarify that this is one person's perspective.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI was thinking of enrolling in the part time QA program but I have been thinking if its even creditable enough on its own to get a job as a QA associate. Does anyone here or anyone here knows someone whose taken the QA part time program? How was the program overall? Also I want to know if anyone has been successful with it amongst employers and or if you had to take other courses/programs to go along with the QA program in order to be employable for a QA position. Thank you!",

They were very knowledgeable and made really good QA people.\n\nOne thing I will say is both of these people did have some prior background in software development so I don't know how much of a difference that made for them in the success they had with this program or not.",

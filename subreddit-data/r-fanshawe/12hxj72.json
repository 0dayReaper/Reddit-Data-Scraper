I was wondering if I could have a little insight into both the program you attended and the residences, as I am required to move out (I live in Vaughan so quite far from both schools).\n\nThank you! Any and all responses are greatly appreciated!",

Check who are your faculties and stalk them on ratemyproffesor .com or LinkedIn just to see their credentials.\n\nI am not sure about Algonquin, I would visits both colleges and take tour first officially or tour the colleges by yourself. No one will bother you\n\nFanshawe has on campus residence which is expensive imo and they also have a building right opposite to the campus which is 2 mins away from from the main campus by walk, it is called foundry first I recommended to Check with both the spots.\n\nIf you choose Fanshawe please get your residency and parking sorted as soon as poss because they do on first come first serve basis.",

Fanshawe res is good I lived there and loved it. I don\u2019t know what option of meal plan I got but every food place was included with the meal plan card",

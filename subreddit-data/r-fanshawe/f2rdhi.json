    "postText": "Since so many people think its cool to blast music out of their shitty iphone speakers at 2500+hz, I think its appropriate to bring back the shouldered boom box. I will be cruising up and down the halls blasting my favorite beats for everybody to hear, regardless if you think my musical tastes are shit or not.\n\nI encourage EVERYBODY to start blasting music with a real boom box. Annoying dude on the bus who thinks everybody should be listening to *his* music? BOOMBOX that shit!!!\n\nGroup of girls in Oasis watching Big Bang Theory on a tablet at full volume? BOOM BOX THAT SHIT!!!",

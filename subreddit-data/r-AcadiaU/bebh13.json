    "postText": "Hey AcadiaU, thought I'd share my podcast with you.\n\nIt's called The Perri Platform and my goal is making it easier for Canadians (particularly young people) to keep up with news and politics. \n\nAs a student, it felt like my peers were growing more interested in these topics so I figured I should address that somehow. I try to differentiate my show via short episodes, a personable tone and sharing my opinions which aren't heavily polarized in one direction.\n\nCurrently, I'm on episode 15 and release new content every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. If you'd like to check it out, I have some links at the bottom. \n\n[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-perri-platform/id1456505909?mt=2 ) // [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/52uVciQc8OnPseIZxiMVaG ) // [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/perriplatform ) // [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/m/Iw3dex3sprbhdmppiuaca5inkou?t=The_Perri_Platform)",

Is this really all that Acadia offers for career help? I kid of feel like I\u2019m being tossed into the ocean with no life jacket haha.\n\nAre there any resources that can be accessed either through the university or are local enough that I can get to them by walking/bus?",

I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll help you if you\u2019re not a co-op student but I think it\u2019s worth a shot ",

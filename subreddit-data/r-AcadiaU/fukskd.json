The other choice for bio 1113 is glenys gibson. The other choices for chem is a tbd instructor, the new Italian prof, John, and then Prof Jha. Please help me decide \ud83e\udd7a",

I want to ask someone in the biology department if I can low key request the sections because I would like to be in labs with my friends lol, which is why I would like to know who to choose asap before they fill up. Since it is tbd, it would probably most likely be dr. Lukeman or Cathy right? \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude2c",

Hillier moves very fast, his slides suck and his exams had multiple correct answers for multiple choice questions which was brutal. Overall, John and Glenys.",

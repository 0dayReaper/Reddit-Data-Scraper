            "comment": "The short answer is no. \n\nThe long answer is that there aren't enough sections of computer science or engineering courses to offer them in the evenings. Currently there aren't any computer science courses offered in the evening, and there won't be any next year either. I believe that is the same for engineering. You could do some of your electives in evening sections, but it wouldn't be possible to do the whole degree in evening courses.\n\nIf you have any other questions, or if you would like to discuss what a degree would look like full-time, let me know.",

So the only degree or course I can consider are online / night classes for the majority of courses. Towards the end I could do a semester of normal hours but I would have to get they the first few years .",

Most schools will accept some credits from other universities, but they usually evaluate them *after* you have taken them (and once you are enrolled locally) so it is a bit of a crap shoot as to which courses will be accepted and which won't. \n\nThere are a few courses that are offered in the summer months (condensed courses into a 3 week period), but those are also limited.",

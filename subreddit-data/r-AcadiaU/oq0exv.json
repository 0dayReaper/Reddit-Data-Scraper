    "postText": "First of all, i'm glad that i found this sub. Second of all, me and 2 other students from germany have been accepted to attempt our exchange semester at Acadia. \n\nNow, everything is going well so far, however i was wondering what place i should choose to stay in. The two people i am going there with chose \"Roy Jodrey Hall\" and \"Crowell Tower\". I am still a little unsure of where to go, as some of my mates who went to an american University said that the dorms are usually shit and all the fresh 18 year olds go there.\n\nSo if some of you still remember which houses where the \"Best\", i would be glad to find out :)\n\nOh, and if you have anything else that you think is important to know as an exchange Student I'm obviously thankful to hear that as well.",

            "comment": "Tower is great IMO. Roy Jodrey is new, don't know it - but hard to go wrong with any of the residences at Acadia. Tower is good fun, and it's nice to have a view when you need to stare out the window.\n\nIf I could offer advice, it would be do not select a 'quiet' floor. All the floors will have moments of quiet and loud, but the quiet floors tend to be less active socially, and can attract a few of the more introverted/awkward types. Go for a normal floor and you'll be fine.\n\nSource - lived in Tower for two years, including a year as an RA on 11th.",

I should say too (reading your other comments) that I was 23 and 24 when I was in Tower for first year and second year and I didn't feel 'too old', heck one of the guys on my floor my first year was 30. If anything, the few extra years of life experience just meant I was a bit more able to handle the many adventures of residence life, and gave me the confidence to play a bigger part in uni life, which I really enjoyed.",

That way you'll make friends in the building you plan to live in. Chipman is a good party Res but is seriously a cult. Fun if you can get behind that though. Dennis is good too and typically has a lot of female frosh, if that's what you're into. Eaton and Christofer aren't bad either. Chase is expensive and a bit sectioned off. Rojo, tully, seminary are all a no-go if you want the full party experience. Tower is decent but tends to be separated a bit from the others. Barrax is usually pretty weird. Cutten is a bit separated but big and fun. Good luck! reply if you have questions ",

The fun/rowdy level of Tower changes year to year, I've seen it get fucking crazy (I was an RA there) but I've also seen it chilled out. If you're looking for guaranteed rowdiness look for Chip/Eaton/Dennis (definitely not Chase, good lord)\n\nIf you really really need to switch residences though you'll be able to do it after the room freeze ends in like the end of September/beginning of October",

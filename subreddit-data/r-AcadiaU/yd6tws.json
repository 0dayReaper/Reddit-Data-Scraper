    "postText": "I am the Nova Scotia Lead for Team Rubicon Canada. We are a Disaster Response Organization made up of veterans, first responders and kick-ass civilians. Our mission is to provide relief to those affected by disaster, no matter when or where they strike, by pairing the skills and experiences of our veterans, first responders and civilian members with resources, equipment and technology solutions to provide the greatest service and impact possible. We are expanding in Atlantic Canada to meet the needs of our community.\n\nWe are looking for individuals who are interested in pairing their newly acquired academic and practical skills with disaster response volunteer work. Our disaster response organization provides opportunities to expand your skills and experience in a wide variety of areas and there are a number of volunteering options with Team Rubicon. We are looking for people who are willing to step forward in a disaster and offer their unique skills, abilities, talents and efforts towards our mission of being there for people on their worst days.\n\nSome of the skills we are looking for include:\n\nIT/GIS training which can help with disaster mapping, and disaster communications infrastructure. We establish It networks, build a picture of the disaster area, and communicate that to those who need it. If you are in a GIS or IT program, we want you.\n\nMass Communications and marketing training which can help tell with public messaging in a disaster, tell the story, and build the Team Rubicon brand. If you are a mass communications, or marketing program student, we want you.\n\nTeam Rubicon is agile and responsive because we plan the shit out of logistics. We get where we need to be, with the gear we need to be mission effective, because we understand disaster logistics and supply chain management. If you are a business student, or a planner, we want you.\n\nRegardless of what Program you are in, or whether you are a local or international student, the number one thing we look for in a volunteer is a passion to help others. Even if you aren't in one of the programs I mentioned, we want you. We provide a wide variety of training and skills development. We represent a wide spectrum of abilities and talents.\n\nIf you have a pulse... we want you and there is a place for you in our Team.\n\nWe are not your father's charity. Team Rubicon isn't looking for people to sell cookies, candles, subscriptions, or make calls. We have absolutely no interest in selling you a time share condo. We don't demand weekly attendance, or a minimum number of volunteer hours per month. You decide how much time you have to offer. We will let you know when and where there is a need. You decide whether or not you want to sign-up and register for an operation, event, or training.\n\nWe provide the training. We cover the travel costs (airfare, accommodation and food). We provide the mission. We provide the comradery, teamwork, inclusivity, and sense of community. You provide the passion, the dedication, enthusiasm and sweat.\n\nCheck us out and/or register on our website: [https://team-rubicon.ca](https://team-rubicon.ca/) or peak at our socials. Find out what we are up to, where we are deployed, some of the cool training we offer (hint: find out what a Sawyer does) and hear the stories of people from all walks of life who've stepped into the arena.\n\nTim",

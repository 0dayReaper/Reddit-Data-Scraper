If people are breaking the law or bylaws it should be dealt with by the police, just like for anyone else. \n\nAnd having RAs off campus? How would that even work? Are they going to be lurking around on people's property peeking through the windows to make sure no one is playing the dreaded beer pong?\n\nA university should be in the business of educating students, not trying to play mommy to a bunch of grown adults.",

A number of towns with universities and colleges have had to deal with off-campus homecoming or Saint Patrick's Day parties that have gotten out of hand.  As a result a large number of police and emergency services workers have had to be on hand to handle the crowds and provide emergency care.  This comes at a significant cost and reflects poorly on the universities and their students.  It would be irresponsible to say that this is not the university's issue as they can hold the students accountable for their actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith regard to off-campus RA's, Acadia has had off-campus reps on students' council, but a number of other universities have off-campus RA's or off-campus sophs.  Their duties are not to peek in off-campus students' windows, but rather to be available as a resource/mentor to off-campus students in the same way that an on-campus RA would.",

            "comment": "While I think it's a nice shiny PR opportunity for the university, I think students should be very disturbed by our Union's president signing a memorandum with the town and the university administration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Students Union was designed to be a voice for the students. Their purpose is to ensure student voices are being heard and students aren't being taken advantage of. Signing a 'memorandum of understanding' with the town and the administration is very dangerous. If our union president is morally alright with signing such a document, he is essentially 'sleeping with the enemy'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur union, our voice. While we as students should act responsibly and respectfully, I think it's in the student body's best interest to look at this with denunciatory eyes. This is not in our best interest. We need our union to stand up for us, not bend to the whims of the administration or the town.  ",

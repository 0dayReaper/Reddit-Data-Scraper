    "postText": "Hey guys and gals, \n\nI'm not a student/prospective student at Acadia, but was looking at moving into the nearby area.  Most of the places we were viewing had rental suits/carriage houses, but we haven't been able to obtain any information on the tenants (yet).\n\nThis led me to running a few scenarios, which led to a few more questions.  So I was hoping anyone with off campus housing could lend some feedback.\n\nHow many students at Acadia have a means of transportation?\n\nHow far away would you be willing to commute to school (Port Williams, Canning, New Minas?)\n\nHow many students living off campus stay in the area year round (compared to heading back home for summer break, ect)? ",

            "comment": "Hi there. 3 years off campus, starting my second summer shortly. Most students live close to campus as there is an abundance of student housing. I personally do not know anyone who lives outside the town limits, aside from people whose families live in the area. I would not count on being able to rent it out consistently\n\nMany students have transportation, but certainly not all.\n\nA solid crowd stays each summer ",

As we are international students do we need to get our immigration documents first to apply for an off campus abode or can I register for off campus without my visa being done yet. Are there any suggestions for good off campus abodes that's nearby to campus?\n\nThank you!",

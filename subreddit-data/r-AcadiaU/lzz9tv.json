We work around the pillars of\u00a0**student empowerment**,\u00a0**outreach within schools**, and\u00a0**marginalized community groups**\u00a0by providing members the opportunity to take leadership of a project, organizing workshops to help high school students transition to post-secondary, and handing out care packages to individuals in the Downtown Eastside while conversing with them. The published interviews with DTES residents can be read here:\u00a0[https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnk20xmh3z6cjbr/UBCHOPE\\_Stories\\_Revised1.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnk20xmh3z6cjbr/UBCHOPE_Stories_Revised1.pdf?dl=0)\n\nIf you are interested,\u00a0**please fill out the Google form below**\u00a0and a team member will contact you.

I highly recommend reaching to her at the main email cs@acadiau.ca and asking this exact question.\n\nGood luck to you, and I hope you come study here.",

The current grad coordinator for Computer Science is Dr. Andre Trudel, so you could contact him. \n\nIn general, acceptance into the program requires that you have the background equal to that of what an honours student out of the Acadia would have, but you also require someone at the school who is willing to supervise you. If your interest areas do not line up with what faculty are interested in, then it is doubtful that you will find a supervisor. ",

    "postText": "The other day me and 3 of my friends were sitting outside on the porch chatting. We were fully within the rules and were having a good time until an older man barged onto our property demanding that we shut our \"party\" down or he would call the police. We tried to explain that the limit was 10 but he kept rambling on about how Wolfville is their town not ours and the limit is whatever the community members say it is. He then went on to accuse us of wanting to \"kill\" him and the rest of the elderly in Wolfville because we had 4 people sitting outside bothering no-one. Eventually he left saying he would call the police, they never ended up coming but our day was ruined.\n\n\nBut my question is has anyone else had any experiences like this? I was talking to one of my friends and she says she has had people confront her over not wearing a mask outdoors in a park, and has even had someone scream \"go the blazes home\" from a car at her one night while she was walking home from work.",

I live in Quebec and the stigma of not properly and responsibly hanging out and shit is mad real. \n\nI work retail too so a lot of my customers and coworkers blame universities for allowing kids to migrate great distances when that's technically what spreads the virus. I mean shit , if your class is online, well then no need to go all the way over there right? \n\nplus there's a certain stupid hypocritical ownership of the town since they're permanent residents even though having university kids go to the town is what keeps the businesses and the town booming. I guess nobody cares since old people are dying. and that's they think of you.\n\nin any case, here in Quebec people do step up to you and start yelling about civic duty and stuff but that's only if you're an idiot and don't wear your mask or have a Bbq out back n shit. if what you're saying is true about you guys just chilling; that old guy is just tripping. But if ya'll had like loud music and were drinking beers and shit well, can you blame the old bastard? just go inside  and play xbox, no need to freak out the neighbours.",

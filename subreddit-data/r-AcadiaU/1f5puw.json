Is there anyone out there willing to check out potential apartments for me to ensure they're not infested with unmentionables etc?",

Well, I'd talk to some of the real estate agents then and maybe do a Skype inspection, I found people were totally cool with skyping prospective rooms so it should be fine for apartments. I think the big real estate people are called McCarthy or something, hopefully someone who knows more comes in here haha! But yeah, the competition gets pretty fierce for places I guess so if you could come earlier than September I'd probably recommend it.",

I run into quite a few nutrition folk because their department is right above geology, but a few of them seem like crazies. Similar to enviro sci -very idealistic people.

    "postText": "Look, I get it. If you really need more people to respond to your survey go ahead and send it once, or hell even twice is only a little bit annoying.\n\nBut don't send out any more emails after that. No, not even a \"friendly reminder\". If I haven't answered your survey after 2 emails it's not because I've forgotten. It's because i don't know you and don't care enough about your RDA project to give away my time for free. Also, the rest of your classmates have already shit up my inbox with their endless surveys and it's not my job to help the entire psych department with their research.\n\nAnd no, I don't want to take your National Survey on Student Engagement either. I've already gotten 7 emails from you begging me to do this. The 8th is not going to convince me. And no, pasting my name into your little form letter to make it seem more personal isn't going to convince me either.\n\nI've literally gotten more spam emails from Acadia than Nigerian Princes or dodgy websites that sell your email. Why do you think that pissing people off with your 5 emails is going to make people want to help you?",

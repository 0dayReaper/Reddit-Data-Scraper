    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an international student and will spend the winter 2023 term at acadia. I just read the guidelines for living in residence and while most of them seem reasonable and make sense to me I\u2019m quite confused by the whole scent free thing. It says it\u2019s not allowed to use scented products like shampoo body wash skin care products etc and even deodorant is mentioned. Is that actually that serious? I don\u2019t even know where I could find something like scent free deodorant or body wash. And while it definitely is possible to not use it I like to wear cologne too. So is it actually that serious and everything has to be scent free or is it just about not using huge amounts of scented products and cologne so that people can smell you from the other side of the building?",

I wouldn't imagine most personal hygiene products would be a problem.",

That said in general, such rules are often refering to strong scents. Your cologne I certainly wouldn't reccomend wearing, but as long as your shampoo, bodywash, or deoderant isn't too strong of a scent you shouldn't have any problems (I would avoid brands like Old Spice, or Axe). Especially if like me, you prefer to shower at night before bed. Rules like this exist to keep things incluaive for everyone, and to protect those who may have alergies to certain scents. As for deoderant, finding scent free deoderant is actually fairly easy, you can find it in virtually any store that sells personal care products (but again as long as you avoid strong scents you should be fine). If you can't find what you need at home New Minas is 5 minutes up the road from campus by car, it's the main shopping hub for the whole Valley so you'll be able to find what you need there.",

Deodorant, shampoo and body wash is okay to be scented as long as its not obnoxious. Cologne, perfumes, body sprays are what bother people most with scent sensitivities.",

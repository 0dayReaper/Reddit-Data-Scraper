There was actually a guy who played in the Q on one team this year.\n\nReply above is correct though, the games are all super late at night which is pretty brutal, lots of games get canceled last minute, or the refs dont show. \n\nAs far as contact, there isnt checking, and they dont have much tolerance for it. Its not like house league, you can still rub people out and shit, but if you straight up line someone up you\u2019re gonna get tossed, maybe even banned. I got hit from behind in a game this past year and the guy who hit me can\u2019t play any intramurals for the rest of his time at Acadia. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for contact, Id reccomend you live in Chipman or Eaton, as the CHeaton cup is full contact, or look into the Jr B league.",

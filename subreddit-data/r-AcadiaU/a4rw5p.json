I think a lot more people would be interested in talks like these than you\u2019ve been lead to believe, provided they were actually productive and respectful. People on this sub are equating a conservative speaker with some alt right nonsense, but that\u2019s the far side of a very wide spectrum. Organize a talk, if people show, then they\u2019re interested, if not, now you know. ",

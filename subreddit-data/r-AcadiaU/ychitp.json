    "postText": "Hii, I'm a prospective international student looking into Biology at Acadia. If there's anyone who has experience w this program, could you please tell me how it was for you, the stuff that you liked and didn't like, what the internship and research opportunities were like and how the coop experience is? Do people get coops? What kind of coops do they get through this program? I'm worried about that, and the research part too, since I've been told that spots gets filled up quickly.\n\nI've heard of their private research island where students can do their own research which is super interesting- so if you have any pointers about that or the program as whole, I'm all ears!",

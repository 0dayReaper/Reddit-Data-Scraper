    "postText": "Hello, wondering if anyone can shed any light on what a good average is for Acadia entrance scholarships? Some universities make it easy to determine what the amount would be and others are a bit more nebulous. Am looking for an amount where the high school average would be between 90% to 94.9%. Thanks in advance. ",

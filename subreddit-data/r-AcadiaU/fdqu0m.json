I don\u2019t know why he gets amusement from being a disgusting sack of dog crap, but he does. Please just ban him and report him in hopes of getting his account deleted. Please don\u2019t encourage his awful behavior. Here\u2019s a quick link so you can see for your self the kind of immature, insensitive shit he\u2019s been posting. u/zhu_wang",

But when a clear and obvious troll like this one arises, there's not much else to do. Thanks for persistently bringing this up, /u/Dr_Despacito, /u/nathpenn, and /u/CombustibleOre.\n\nAs of yet, no other users have been banned. Please keep reporting comments and posts as they come up.",

You can follow the event in the post to get a reminder. [Here's a link to the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiberalStudies/comments/fpffy5/thursday_april_2_live_ama_with_economist_vincent/)\n\nYou can either post now and ask him any economics-related question pertaining to the coursework your doing, or any upcoming exams you may have while you're at home, or chat with him about it on April 2.\n\n(also, he's bilingual, so you can ask in either English or French!)",

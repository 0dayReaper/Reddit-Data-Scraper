            "comment": "It's been a few years, and while I found them all to have their own culture, on the rowdy/quiet scale I didn't really see much variation. Tower, Barrax (War Memorial) and Chipman have more of a reputation for being wild, but I went to most of my parties in Chase (where I lived) and Eaton, just because most of my friends in those houses. Seminary is mostly a quiet house but all of the other houses have quiet floors/sections. I think Chase, Dennis, Tower, Chipman, Eaton/Christofor and Barrax are all on a similar level for meeting people and partying so I'd recommend choosing based on what suits you best. Chase is all singles, which works for some people and doesn't for others, and has a nice courtyard for the spring and fall, Chase and Dennis are the closest to meal hall, E/C and Chipman are on the quad, Barrax is the closest to the gym and most science/business classes, Seminary and Dennis are closest to the arts classes, Tower is close to the parking lot. Tully is the all-girls residence, Seminary is the quietest and Jodrey is quiet with nicer rooms for upper-year students. Meal hall proximity was huge for me, I went for breakfast and just before close a lot more than I would have if I'd lived in Barrax or Sem.\n\nAs far as meeting people, you will. Everyone's looking to meet new people at first. Go to the freshman events, res parties, hang out with people who live near you, or who are in your classes, or who you talk to at parties. The people you hang out with during frosh week probably will not be your group of friends at the end of first semester so don't worry if you don't like them all that much. If you do, cool, you're lucky. If someone invites you to something, go, and if not, then invite people over to your room/nearest lounge. The goal is to end up hanging out with people you want to hang out with but in the meantime you will have plenty of awkward sort-of-friendships. And plan to be in residence for 2 years, because you pretty much have to sign a lease by the end of October if you want to live off campus and signing a year's lease with people you've only known for 1-2 months is a huge mistake. Besides, priority for choosing rooms goes: returning students staying in the same res -&gt; returning students moving to a different res -&gt; new students, so you'll have a choice of a better room or a spot closer to your friends in second year.",

            "comment": "I lived in Chase for three years, and found that the atmosphere depended on who was living there.  My first year, it was mostly first year students.  Most of us stayed second year, so there were fewer frosh that year.\n\nDennis, Tower, and Chipman are all pretty rowdy.  But I definitely recommend Chase for meeting people.  It's all single rooms, but super nice and has lounges in every section so you can hang out.  Plus there's the bonus of having your own room.  \n\nI went to Acadia without any of my friends from home.  I knew no one on campus, and ended up meeting TONS of people by going to the frosh week events.  Some events may not seem up your alley, but trust me, it's the best way to meet people your first week there.",

            "comment": "I came from Ontario and knew no one so I totally get where you're coming from.\nLouder residences would probably be Chipman (arguably the rowdiest), Eaton, Dennis, Cutten, and Christopher but Chase and Barrax are also known for having some parties. For tower it really depends on what floor you're on, some are loud, others aren't (I've also heard rumours that tower might be closed next year but don't take my word for it, it's just a rumour). \nQuiet residences would be sem, tully and rojo (all upper years). I mentioned that Barrax and Chase are known for having parties but they're not mainly party residences.\nPersonally I recommend sem, I lived there for two years and I like it because it's quiet but it's social. Everyone knows each other, there's lots of house events you can make friends in that don't involve drinking if that's not your scene but if you are into partying, sem's nice because you can go party elsewhere and come back to somewhere quiet or if you need to study one weekend while everyone else is partying, it's a good place to be (trust me there will be those weekends when everyone else is out having a good time and you're stuck writing papers, it sucks). \nIf you get put in a res that you don't really like you can always go to residence life and see if you can move to a different one. Each one definitely has it's own character as you'll find out when you get here.\nHope this helps :) ",

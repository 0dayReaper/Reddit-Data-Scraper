It will be an online synchronous text-based group discussion and there will be a total of four group members. A gift card will be provided for your participation.\n\nIf you\u2019re a male student who speaks English as first language aged between 19-25, please contact me at hy204929@dal.ca if you\u2019re interested. \n\nVivian\nFaculty of Management\nDalhousie University",

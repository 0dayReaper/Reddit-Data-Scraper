Barrax is alone at the bottom of the hill so you dont meet people from other residences as freely, unless you try to. I found the seclusion a huge reason why I enjoyed my experience there so much.\nAlso, walking uphill to meal hall 3 times a day will give you a tight booty, so look forward to that.",

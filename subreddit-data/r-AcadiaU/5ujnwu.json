Although the sub might have less value from a promotional standpoint than Facebook, Instagram, etc. to the ASU/University, I think you would reach a very different demographic of the student/alumbi population through here if it were more active.\n\nAlso, considering the relative number of queries that the sub has from prospective students, it would be worthwhile to keep an eye on it to answer any questions. A few users here try to, but it would be great to have more answers!\n\n",

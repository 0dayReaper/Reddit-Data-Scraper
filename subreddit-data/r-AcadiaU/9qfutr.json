My favourites are Summer St (not affected by the street parking ban), and the lot behind the acadia arena field, just next to the Market Hall for day-parking.\n\nBut to be honest, I've always been unhappy about Wolfville's \"no overnight parking\" anywhere situation. Especially for how many licensed restaurants and bars we have.",

I'll look into that, I bet it's really busy during the winter then!!\n\nI'm starting to feel the same way, the town I come from barely has any parking restrictions so dealing with this is all very new to me.

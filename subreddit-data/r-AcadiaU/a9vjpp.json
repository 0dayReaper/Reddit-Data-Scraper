No one wants your spin off subreddits or to hear about how you could change the university if everyone just thought like you. \nI think step one is getting some rules set so that they can be enforced then perhaps a couple mods to keep the peace? Speaking your mind is one thing but this sub has just turned into spamming until you can get a rise out of someone \n\nTo promote a discussion if that is what we do want to do, why not create a thread for it? If we wanna submit new club ideas, perhaps we should have a thread for that as well? ",

In that we try to take a fairly expansive view.\n\nAlso, given that it's been a week and a half since the last round of such posts, I'm hoping that most of the content going forward will be more constructive.",

So when sensible people call for it to be taken down, the alt-right troll can complain about persecution or their freedom of speech being infringed, or whatever. In that way, the moderators are easily bullied into allowing borderline hate speech. It also allows the alt right troll to achieve one of the primary alt-right goals, to twist traditional leftist ideas (tolerance for different opinions) into something they can use to manipulate discourse (you leftists say you're so tolerant, but you won't even tolerate harmless white supremacists). It's really successful on Reddit and elsewhere, especially on subs like this where the mods are busy being full time students.\n\nIt's been hilarious watching it go down on this sub because the alt righters here are not quite skilled enough at the strategy to really make it work. Or as the kids call it, low effort trolling.",

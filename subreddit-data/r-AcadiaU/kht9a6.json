Officially, faculty have 7 business days after their exam to get marks in, so for classes with no exam, that deadline would be today. I just submitted mine a couple of hours ago, and they haven't been posted for students to see yet. \n\nOnly exams written on the 13th and 14th have deadlines before Christmas (today and tomorrow). The rest of the marks are technically due between the 4th and 7th of January. Most faculty don't like to leave their marking this long, but depending the size of the class and the amount of marking, it sometimes takes this long to mark.",

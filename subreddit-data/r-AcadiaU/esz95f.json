    "postText": "Has anyone here taken any of Acadia's online courses and can speak to how they are? \n\nDisclaimer: I actually go to Dal, but they sent me an email last night (a week after registration closed, of course) to say that I apparently need 2 additional courses to graduate this spring. Obviously I'm freaking out a little and am going to have to get this remedied ASAP. My degree is in science, although not super relevant here because I'll only need elective credits.\n\nMy advisor recommended Open Acadia courses, so I'm wondering which ones are generally enjoyable/recommended and which to avoid, if any. Any insights would be VERY much appreciated!",

Unfortunately it doesn't look like there are any human bio courses available right now - have you taken any others?\n\nThe ones currently listed on the website that I could get transfer credit for are: Marine Biology (BIOL 2663), Financial Accounting (BUSI 1013), Scientific Terminology (CLAS 2233), Microeconomic Principles (ECON 1013), An Introduction to the Study of Macroeconomics (ECON 1023), Intermediate French 1 (FRAN 1213), General Oceanography (GEOL 1033), Reading and Writing Music 1 (MUSI 1033), Human Nutrition 1 (NUTR 1313), Astronomy 1 - Observational Methods and Solar System (PHYS 1513), and Introductory Spanish Language 1 (SPAN 1013)\n\nAgain, thank you so much - I don't know anyone at Acadia and really needed some advice",

I\u2019ve also taken intermediate French and astronomy 1 but not online, just in person here at Acadia. I assume they\u2019d be pretty similar though and I found them both extremely easy! Astro and oceanography are pretty well known for being \u201cbird courses\u201d here haha",

I'll need to get everything finished and the mark submitted to Dal by May 1st. Hoping I could get started by the beginning of next week but that obviously depends a lot on the administrative side of things!",

I had Dr. Svetlana Barkanova for Astro, she\u2019s a genius and an absolute peach, for Astro I know the assignments are likely the same (I took it 3 years ago) which were just MasteringAstronomy assignments through Pearson (or they may be on moodle now, but same idea), and were super easy and all on google lol.. French would be different depending on the prof and I just had a contract hire for that class so I\u2019m probably not much help there. If you already know some French, it would be super easy regardless. As for scientific terminology, I have Dr. Liong who is also great. Basically you get this book from amazon for like $15 and then everything is in it. There\u2019s 12 units and each unit has 1 assignment and 1 quiz. The assignments are a smidge time consuming but I\u2019m also a perfectionist so hard to say. The format is usually a couple large medical vocabulary words that you have to break down into all their parts with each parts respecting meaning, and come to a literal definition for the word. If you\u2019re considering taking it let me know and I can send you an example of the assignments! The quizzes are super easy and are timed for 5 mins (and you can just google everything or look at the slides lol). There\u2019s a project which I believe is a 2 page essay (?? Not 100% sure about the length), and then the exam which needs to be scheduled 2-4 weeks in advance I believe. Hopefully this helps!",

I am definitely interested in scientific terminology - always wanted to take a linguistics/etymology course but Dal no longer has a linguistics department - so I think I would probably like it.

    "postText": "Hi Acadia, just wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding the University as I might apply for the 2018/2018 semester.\n\n1.When it comes to program specific requirements, such as psychology for instance, it's stated that I would need to meet the following - \"Grade 11 Academic Mathematics. Grade 12 Academic Mathematics recommended.\" \n\nWould that refer to me just studying these subjects in 11th and 12th grade or achieving grades equal to a Canadian level of grade \"X\" Mathematics?\n\n2. Furthermore, does anyone have any information regarding that specific course \"B.Sc. Psychology\", what should my expectations be like ?\n\nThanks in advance \n\n",

I'm just kinda concerned about that because some unis have rejected me because of my Math/Biology grades not meeting their requirements. I would be fine if I could take some sort of a test on these subjects to cover the requirements.\n",

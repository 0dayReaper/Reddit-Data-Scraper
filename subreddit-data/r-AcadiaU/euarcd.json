            "comment": "I lived in chipman back in \u201804-\u201805. It was the first year it went co-ed. We started out with something like 30 or 40 girls and finished the year with 11. \n\nPeople used to pee in the elevator - a lot. We\u2019d play Mario brothers with the ceiling tiles. The vending machine used to have these cans of fruit juice. People would put them in the freezer and then chuck the frozen cans through the windows. \n\nThe trash cans from the bathroom can be filled with water and leaned against the door to the rooms. When the door is opened in the morning, water floods their floor. Don\u2019t leave your Xbox/PlayStation on the ground. Called a leaner \n\nAlso - you can piss on a cookie baking sheet, freeze it, slide the frozen piss under someone\u2019s door (or at least leave it in front if you can\u2019t get it under). Melts overnight. Piss pucks. \n\nWe used to have quart/court night in the fall semester. Everyone wears a white shirt and drinks a quart of whatever liquor they want. Grab a sharpie and write all over the shirts. I think they stopped doing this because a guy died in 2011. \n\nFight night was also a thing. In the earliest days it was in the basement of the res. It moved on to be in the MacKeen room. Paramedics were on hand and all proceeds went to charity. Not sure if that still goes on, but my guess would be no. Basically just a boxing match. Could fight anyone on campus. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions about anything I missed. I love reminiscing about that degenerate stuff",

Quart night isnt an organized thing anymore unfortunately, but its just kind of a regular occurrence that most of the boys polish off a quart in a night. We\u2019re still a bunch of degens who get obliterated every weekend, don\u2019t think that\u2019ll ever change about Chip. \n\nFight night isnt a thing anymore, but we\u2019ve had some interesting nights where the boys strap up the gloves and go at it after a few brews.\n\nCac is still a huge thing, you\u2019ll get 40+ people out on a good night. Also Cheaton is held during the week now which nobody\u2019s really too happy about,  but at least now the guys playing get to go hard at Red Death on the weekend.\n\nI\u2019d say our damage costs, after being divided between everyone living here this year is probably somewhere in the range of $300-$400 per person, and we still have a few months for that to grow lmao. \n\nNever a dull moment here, man. Glad to hear you guys were just as fucked as we are.",

Definitely some crazy nights, but all and all nothing like the stories I heard from back in the day.\n\nThe learners thing is funny though, one night this dude leanered a kid who had a chick in his room. Guy fucking lost his mind and came out of the room swinging. Other guy grabbed him and put him in a chokehold to calm him down, but dude in the chokehold grabbed the nearest beer bottle on the ground and swung it behind him, ended up splitting the guy's head open.\n\nSo many smashed ceiling tiles. Every weekend.\n\nWatched a guy punch a hole in the wall in the hallway on 2nd, was afraid he'd have to pay for it, so he patched it up with toothpaste like it was crackfill \ud83e\udd23\n\nI met my now wife there too. Lots of good memories, was a fun time even though there were a lot of fucking assholes that lived there too.\n\nCAC was still a thing when I was there, and Frosh kegger, pig roast, red death, all dressed up. Fight night was done though.\n\nSadly we had a guy die there the year after I left from alcohol poisoning. I didn't know him, but I knew his buddies that all lived there the year before he moved there. Still breaks me up thinking about it.\n\nHonestly a miracle more people didn't die while I lived there seeing some of the shit I did.\n\nIt was a family there though. People were so tight in the building and looked out for each other.",

CAC hit a sort of slow down while I was there - the first two years it was wild, but it kinda fizzled and for slow in the mid to late 2000s for a few years until the next generation came and moved it to the vil. \n\nOne year we had the house put on bottle ban by homecoming and had a Texas mickey race in the basement the first night of bottle ban. \n\nSucks about red death, but there were always some haggard stories from that shit anyway - few arrests, one kid fell out of a tree, another flipped over the railing of the back porch at 25 prospect. By the way, if it isn\u2019t still, get 25 prospect into chipman hands and host all the parties there. That was where our parties always were \n\nHope the frosh hell weeks are still going strong too\n\nGlad to hear everyone is still enjoying it. Not to sound too old, but I recommend staying on top of your academics too - it becomes a serious pain in the ass later on if you don\u2019t. I ended up with a few victory laps due to the amount of partying. \n\nKeep raging and remember the motto - work hard, play hard, drink hard, fuck hard.",

            "comment": "Oh wow, I picked a hell of a time to randomly visit my Alma Mater's sub.  Definitely didn't think i'd go down a Chipman memory lane.\n\nSo I lived in Chipman when it was all male, both immediately before and after the renovations and just immediately before it went co-ed. Prior to the renos it hadn't been touched since it was first built in 1960. I imagine Oonagh and the folks in Admin thought the renos would act as a motivator to disuade further property damage. They were mistaken.\n\nThe year before the renos was wild. The big room in the basement didn't have that wall dividing the hallway and the room, so it was a one big room. It was used for all kinds of shenanigans.\n\nI remember distinctly the first night of Frosh Week. All the frosh had to assemble downstairs in nothing but boxers, frosh shirts, a pillow, and their mattress. So we all lugged our cardboard-filled cheaply made mattresses downstairs and arranged them in to a big mat. The Frosh Bosses then instructed that we would be having a pillow fight with the winner having his choice of mattress for the rest of the year. Imagine 40+ 17-18 year olds first time living away from home all with something to prove and senpai to impress, so to speak. Nobody pulled any punches. I remember they all went first for this one guy called \"The Russian\". I can't remember his name for the life of me but he wasn't Russian at all (think he was from Bedford), but he looked like the Russian from Rocky 4. He went down quick. I don't remember who took me out but i remember getting whacked something fierce on the side of the head, and one of the frosh bosses pulling me out. I felt halfway concussed. Fun time. \n\nThat year during frosh week was the last time that the entirety of Chipman's Hell Night happened in-house. I'm not going to say much more about it than that, but anyone who experienced Hell Night can imagine the smell and how it must have taken weeks to get out of the basement.\n\nLater on in the 1st semester we had Fight Night in that same basement. Built a half-decent boxing ring and rigged up a mic to drop from the ceiling for the announcer. There must have been 300/400 people packed in any which nook and cranny of that place. Even with the windows open, the heat was intense. One of the Chipman honchos was sitting there ringside with a keg he tapped essentially for himself and his girlfriend (also the ring-girl of the evening).  There were about 5-6 fights of 3 rounds per fight. I think most fights were between the relatively friendly who just wanted to experience it and not have any FOMO. The half-time entertainment was this guy Sammy. He was a big guy who loved him his beer. Played for the football team. If you imagine a guy named \"Billy-Bob\", that's what Sammy would look like.  Great guy. For the entertainment of the crowd, he rigged up this toilet that he hoisted on his shoulder, pressed the flush lever, and was essentially a beer bong fed right to his stomach. It was equal parts gross, amazing, and insane all at once and was quintessentially Sammy. This guy also CAC'ed-In at 6.28 seconds if memory serves. It was a record then, and probably still is. We used to joke that the only thing stopping that record was gravity.\n\nRemember what I said about friendly fights? The main event was not that. The main fight that year was legendary. It was between a Chipman (and Acadia) legend named Biff. Biff was fighting this guy from out of town who came in specifically to fight Biff for sleeping with his girlfriend from Tower and Fight Night was going to be his cathartic medium. I remember the fight well and could replay it with photographic clarity. Biff came out to the music of [Oasis' *Fucking in the Bushes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC__5_3dK7Q) which for anyone who saw the movie Snatch was the music playing while Brad Pitt's gypsy bare-knuckle boxer character came out to. The DJ that night kept the music going on waaaay longer than anyone else and Biff circled the outside of the ring to amp up the crowd. Fight starts and they're trading jabs back and forth. Biff almost cartoonishly is keeping back with his left fist all the way out front while his right arm is pulled all the way back and winding up like he was Popeye or something. Biff just keeps going on like this for what feels like minutes just taunting the other guy.....and then he just launches, lands that one punch, and buddy goes down flat on his back out cold. Biff is just there with his arms up in the air all champion pose with that big ol' missing-a-tooth-somwhere goon grin he had. He's all celebrating while right behind him the ersatz \"paramedic\" was trying to get room pushing people back so buddy could get air. No clue what happened to their relationship after that. What a goddamn night that was. There were more fight nights after, but absolutely nothing came close to the energy that night.\n\nBathrooms were totally different that year also. Remember it was built as an all-male dorm in the 60's so while there was privacy, it was pretty minimal. Each section had two, One bathroom was sinks/urinals/toilets, the other was about 5 shower stalls with only a curtain for privacy. The shower room had a riser you had to step over so in the event of a drain blockage it would take a while to overflow over the lip. We used that to our advantage. During winter, we would take the time to block off wherever air could escape, and cover most of the drains to just let the minimum amount of water to drain and we'd turn on all the hot water taps, let it steam up for a bit and have a sauna. We'd normally do this on the first floor so we could open the window, jump out into the snow, and run back inside. After the renovations with the bathrooms being individual, and much smaller, we would instead take the biggest bathroom possible, find large rocks, put them in the oven at 500\u00b0C for 4 hours, take them out with hockey sticks and dump them into steel garbage cans, bring them into the pre-steamed bathroom with fold out chairs, and pour water over the hot rocks and have a real sauna.  Yellowjackets would do their rounds, peek their heads in and we'd be like \"In or out?\". They left us alone after that. And screw it, our tuition dollars paid for our lodging, so we were going to take full advantage of that hot water!\n\nMost of the other stories involve broken ceiling tiles, the one time someone poured honey right into the electrical system of the elevator, and that one time this one guy who was rather \"special\" decided to bake pot brownies and then forgot about them completely so when they burned and smoked up, it triggered the alarms and send the fire department over. That was fun.\n\nThere's definitely more, some great, others I'm less proud of.",

The whole sauna thing is the most innovative thing I think we\u2019ve ever heard. We\u2019ve so badly wanted to organize a legitimate fight night, but the university obviously wont allow anything close to it to take place. The closest we\u2019ve had was our Chip boys initiation. Can\u2019t get much into detail about it but I\u2019d say a few boys ended up conked for sure. \n\nAnd my god, the name Biff still floats around Chip. That man\u2019s legacy will live on forever I swear. We actually punched out a tile on first this year that had a poem dedicated to Biff and the boys on it. The amount of pride everyone whos lived in Chip has about the building is crazy. So glad to have chosen to live here.\n\nAny more stories we\u2019d all love to hear em, and if you ever feel like coming back for a visit the boys would be more than happy to accommodate. \n\nCheers man!",

Biff and his crew ended up cancelling Eaton's pub crawl.\n\nTo set the stage, you have to remember the time, this was around 2001 and while everyone had internet it was by no means as developed and integrated in our lives as it is now. Now if you have an order or contract or anything, it you get automatic email updates and everything so there's a paper trail and accountability. Not as much the case almost 20 years ago. If you got a statement it was in the mail and might have taken 2-3 days. I'm not sure how it is now but there was practically only one bus company at the time, maybe still is. So Eaton were having their pub crawl and had ordered like 4-5 busses. While it might not have been Biff directly but definitely those in his crew did was call up the bus company the morning of the pub crawl pretending to be that year's Eaton house president. They say that they regrettably needed to cancel the busses that night because their ticket sales weren't as much they had hoped, the whole \"we apologize for the lateness of this but it is in the best interest, yes we understand the deposit is not refundable, yadda yadda yadda\". So the bus company considers it a done deal. No enail or message sent saying \"we acknowledge your cancellation\" and whatnot. So there they are on a Friday night everyone in Eaton pub crawl shirts wondering where the busses are. Not sure what the conversation between Eaton and the bus company was after that but my god it was hilarious.\n\nI'm sure more will pop into my head as I give it time. Others I'm much more reticent to share on a public forum. \n\nThen there are the legendary CAC meetings. My god. Those require a post just on their own.",

The one adjacent to the wall is slightly larger and has the window, but the smaller one will contain more steam. Either way, you'll fit 4-5 people with fold out chairs max. Again, those stones have to be heated for a good 4-5 hours in the oven.\n\nWe'd take a plastic margarine container or something like that and cut a hole in the bottom and duct tape it upside down over the drain in the shower so the hot water pools in the shower stall but will drain before it spills over. If you get a cardboard or ideally something laminated, tape it over the vent on the door, and then put a towel under the door. Turn on the hot water full blast about 30 mins before you're ready.  Get a beat up (ideally wood) hockey stick to transfer those heated rocks into the galvanized steel garbage bin. Goalie stick works great. \n\nHappy sauna-ing.",

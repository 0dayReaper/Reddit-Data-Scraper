How are the facilities? If you had to compare to a university from Ontario which would it be? And anything else you think I should know, thanks!",

            "comment": "Well, party and night life now is pretty much nonexistent ha, but in a normal setting there's plenty of parties going on both large and small. People are mostly chill so don't feel weird abt setting boundaries. There's also lots of school sponsored events, some super high energy and kinda racy, others very chill--you've got a swath all across the spectrum. If you're looking for something extracurricular at acadia, you'll find it.\n\nCampus is perfect and the reason I went. Great walk no matter what route you take across it and good excercise. Buildings are far enough that you appreciate the scenery but not so far that you're late. \n\nAs for the classes, it depends on the major, and the profs. Im in compsci, and most every class there is fantastic (aside from a few). But I've had some really bad experiences in the math department, personally. What major are you going into?",

            "comment": "Party night life: good but gets repetitive, make sure that your enjoyment comes from the people you are with not just the things you consume. \n\nCampus: not too big, you are on a hill so expect some sweats but you get used to it. Gorgeous in the summer and in snowfall, would recommend a summer in Wolfville to any student. \n\nBest courses: subjective, but personally World Rhythm and Drumming is incredible and taught by a super passionate and inspiring prof, \n\nFacilities: are okay, there are more than enough place to study peacefully, you dont need to stick to the common places but you can find your own little nook and work there. Sports facilities are not bad, dont expect to get too much time on the basketball court, football field, or rink unless you want to destroy your sleep schedule. The gym is great, but mornings its packed with members of the community that are not students. Go during uncommon times if you want to see the least amount of people. Good gym community from the students though. \n\nCompare to ontario: no clue, not super familiar with Ontario universities. However, expect Acadia to give you as much as you put in. Make an effort to be part of the community and the culture, because it will pay off. The fact that it is smaller university has some benefits and some negatives. You have a better relationship with your profs (again make the effort to reach out), they are USUALLY more than willing to help. Careful about being burnt out, the campus can be constraining and the routine can take its toll, make sure to get out a bit, there is tons of nature around to go an explore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that covers some of your questions? feel free to ask anything else.",

                            "comment": "School spirit is pretty good for a small school. Acadia does pretty well with their varsity athletes, the girls more so than the guys. Basketball games are fun to go to and there is a student section at most sporting events! That said the games are usually during prime party hours which makes it difficult to get a majority of the student population to show up. The school spirit really comes around during Homecoming (go figure). But if you want to watch high quality sports games during the weekend or scattered throughout the week then you will have more than enough options to do so. Students get free passes to all league games but I beleive there is a fee for bigger regional/national events. might have to fact check that. But those events are worth going to.",

That\u2019s just because the downsizing of some companies in the last year, and there\u2019s still lots of opportunity to go around. \n\nI would recommend looking into the applied computer science options as well if you really don\u2019t care for the math side, or like the more business focused aspects of technology. \n\nYou really only get out of the program what you put in.",

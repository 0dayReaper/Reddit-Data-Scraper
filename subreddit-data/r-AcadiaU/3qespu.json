Additionally we are inviting people bring their own computers in hopes of getting some games happening as well.\n\nIf there is any interest, we have a Facebook event page set up here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1702690526634824\n\nAlso, there are some posters around campus advertising the event. With any luck, we can have at least a handful of people show up. Hard to say at this point!\n\nIf this is even remotely successful, we'll likely try holding more events in the future in hopes of mayyyyybe establishing some sort of eSports club (or something).\n\nThanks!",

By not having a religious test, they were not a typical \u201creligious university\u201d where all the faculty / administrators were of the same religion. So while the major degree was theology, it wasn\u2019t a Baptist university in the sense that all of the classes were taught with a religious slant. To label it a \u201cChristian university\u201d, you would need a religious test for both students and staff. ",

It is remarkable that they did not put a test of faith like every other school did. There most certinally was a statement of faith they facult and staff had to agree to. In fact, the faculty of theology, which is still on campus today, still signs a statement.\n\nIn the eairly years all faculty would have been Christian. Acadia was made a public institution only in 1965-1966. Until then the presidents all were approved by the baptist convention of Atlantic Canada. Most were ordained Baptist clergy. Even today a portion of the board of governors are elected by the Atlantic Baptist\u2019s. \n\n",

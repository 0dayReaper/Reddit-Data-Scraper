    "postText": "Hello! I went to Acadia in the mid-90s to the early 00s, and one of my most vivid memories was of a concert we had during opening week 1995. She was up there alone, played piano and sang. The rumor was she'd made it big right before the show and didn't want to do it, but had either signed a contract or decided to do it anyway.  \n  \nShe got super angry at everyone talking during the show, stopped playing mid-song and yelled at everyone to \"shut the fuck up.\" Finished her set in 40 minutes or something and stormed off.  \n  \nI felt simultaneously bad for her, and like she was an ass. Who books a quiet piano show for frosh week anyway? I've been trying to remember who it was off and on for years now. Does anyone know?",

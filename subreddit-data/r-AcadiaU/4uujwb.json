    "postText": "I will be attending Acadia University in the fall and I have some concerns regarding my living situation. \n\nOne thing I am very specific about is having a private/ single suite with my own bathroom preferably. \nAfter having called Residence life, I have found out that all single suits have been taken and all that is left is double rooms. \n\nThis creates a problem for me. So I started looking into off-campus housing. I noticed the yearly cost ended up being cheaper that staying at residence. \n\nI wanted to get input from someone who has stayed in off campus housing and attended Acadia university. I am an out of province student, coming for the first time to Nova Scotia. \n\nThis being said, would you recommend the off-campus housing option? What are some good ways to look for property online? I want to purchase the 7 day mac meal plan as well, would this be compatible with off campus housing?  \n\n\nAny input is appreciated. Thanks.",

Only issue can be that some people find it difficult to get into friend groups early on since most social first year activities are all fine through the different residences. But if you're confident in that then it can only stand to help you. And it's always gonna make you look like a boss when you can throw house parties in your first year. \n\nTldr, if you're shy, take a year in res. you will benefit massively socially and make great friends worth the extra money.  Aside from that, definitely go off campus. You'll love it. ",

The only reason I'm a little bit uncertain is because Google Maps tells me it's a 19 minute walk. \n\nDo you think it would be impractical to get a room that far? Being that I'll be walking to school everyday? \n",

It's not the same as having a private washroom but you don't have to worry about being interrupted while you user it or shower. If that is acceptable for you then you could definitely find a single room somewhere. As others have said residence is, in my opinion vital to making friends. ",

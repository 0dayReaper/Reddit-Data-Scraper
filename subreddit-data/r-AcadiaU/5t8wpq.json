    "postText": "Hey all - Im an Acadia alumni who has gone on to start and sell a couple tech companies.  Im also an investor and advisor to some amazing startups.  Im coming back to campus to speak at a couple business classes and other events.  \n\nLast year when I was there I hosted a night at the Axe for anyone who wanted to come and talk about tech, startups or 90's music.  Had a blast so Im coming back to do it again, but this time you have 2 options\n\n1) Thursday March 2nd @ the Axe 8:00 - 10:00.  This will be a bit more chill (still free beer) but I have an early morning and Im old so no big party (at least for me, you can do what you want) \n\n2) Friday March 3rd @ the Axe 8:00 - ???.  Conversation will likely get a bit less productive the later it goes.\n\nEither way, Im buying.  Would love to hear your ideas for new startups or chat about anything where I can be helpful.  \n\nCheers,\n\nChris \n\nEdit: Axe doesn't open until 8:00 on Thursday- so that's when we will start. \n\n",

Thursday you'll get way better conversation, but far fewer people (unless we do a little word of mouth advertising). Friday would be busy, but maybe not a great atmosphere to hang out. On Fridays it tends to get busy around 11:00. ",

If you know anyone that wants to pitch ideas or talk about whatever have them come by. \n\nI'll be there Friday as well - trying to get a couple tables that night too, but I know it gets busy. \n\nCheers",

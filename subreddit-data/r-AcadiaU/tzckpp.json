    "postText": "I shan't name the individual as it is a case pending trial \u2014 though, if anyone has had unauthorized or even pressured into s*xual contact with a professor at Acadia, please reach out and name the class this Professor teaches. If it's the same professor, we can seek justice together. The S.A.N.E. Nurses anticipate more victims, which is why I seek this information now. \n\nI will also gladly name myself to those who've also suffered at the hands of said professor, and even contact you on another platform if that's what you wish, in order to confirm my identity. Lastly, you can choose when (or if) you wish any officers to be involved with your statement. I won't run to the RCMP without one's consent, as I understand how traumatic these things can be when brought back to light so randomly.\n\n\nEdit: ***If you attend Acadia University, please share this among your friends in order to find important information on potential victims, if they wish to proceed with a lawsuit alongside myself.***",

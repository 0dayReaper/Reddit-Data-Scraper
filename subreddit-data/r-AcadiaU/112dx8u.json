    "postText": "I\u2019m a nonbinary high school student in rural Nova Scotia and I just received an offer letter from Acadia offering me a place for the next academic year. I\u2019m on the fence about accepting my offer as it\u2019s close to home and I have family who live nearby, but I\u2019d also like to hear from other schools. I\u2019m making this post to ask a few questions to other people who might\u2019ve on the fence about going to Acadia. \n\nWhat convinced you to go? \nWhat do you wish you\u2019d known before going?\nWhat are some perks about the university? (Staff, campus, residence, etc.)\nWhat\u2019s the surrounding community like?\n\nThanks in advance, I hope I can be convinced to go to Acadia :)",

            "comment": "Hey there! I went a couple years ago and loved it - I actually transferred from a big Ontario university (where I'm from, and now live again). I found that at the big universities, I felt like a number\u2026none of my profs really cared that much about me, and if I didn't come to class or do the work, nobody would notice, I'd just disappear. \n\nAcadia has such small classes and departments that the profs get to know their students and the classes are much more \"discussion\" focused vs \"lecture\" focused (in general - of course depending on subject there will still be some larger 200 person classes, but far less). The profs at Acadia really care about students and teaching and I found it was so much easier to learn, plus I felt like I was getting better \"value\" from my education. My department used to go curling every year, students and profs together, which I thought was so cute.\n\nWolfville is also just a really cute, friendly town that you can get involved with in so many ways. There's the cinema, the farmers market, lots of local businesses, different community programs you can volunteer with, and it's so easy to get to know people and be \"part\" of the community if you want. I found the atmosphere really warm and welcoming and I miss it all the time! My friend is a student there now and feels the same - loves it.",

            "comment": "current student at Acadia and it\u2019s my third year. It\u2019s a nice school on the surface and depending on what program you\u2019re in, you might get a hit or miss w the profs. Acadia has some cool courses and opportunities but not much else. Acadia sucks all your money from you with the crappy meal hall and wasting their money every year on a minor project like putting up gates. The town itself is nice  with it being by the water but the locals are assholes who hate students. They constantly complain to town council and town council does everything to restrict students from just living their lives. Example would be putting up residential cameras around the town to catch \u201cmisdeeds\u201d when really they are an invasion of privacy. In addition it is not a friendly/safe place for non-white students/queer people, the town being filled w racist landlords and a racist mayor. Also party life doesn\u2019t really exist anymore. I think Acadia is fine but honestly see what the other schools say. Hope this helps!",

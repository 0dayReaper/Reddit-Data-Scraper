    "postText": "How dare the corrupt administrators fire him without cause! The whole student body is behind you Rock! We are all a member of Mehta Nation! Why don\u2019t we protest to reinstate Mehta as well as for the university president to resign in shame. Why has the student union not stood up and DEMANDED that this honourable professor be reinstated immediately? Student body president should be impeached as well.\n\n\n\nMaybe Mehta could even become the new university president and bring a new era of free speech and tolerance to Acadia? The next new building should also be named after him to honour him as a crusader for freedom and the charter of\nrights and freedoms.\n\n\n\n\nKeep strong Mehta Nation!\n\n\n-Justice4MehtaNOW",

Not sure if that's available to first years though, and it's ridiculously expensive.\nChase is pretty chill and doesn't get too rowdy and it's also not too cutoff from everyone else, so it's probably your best bet for a good uni experience.

(From a person in residence right now). If you end up on a floor you don't like just ask to move to another. It's fairly hassle free. You don't want to live in a silent boring residence because from what i've seen, you'll make no friends.",

            "comment": "Some of the campus may look very nice but Beveridge Arts Center and Huggins seem to be where bulk of the classes are.  They were built a while ago but have power outlets in the tables for laptops.  Patterson seems nice from what I have seen of it but they messed up with the elevator floor numbers that are not matching the floor signs.  We now have the KCIC which is very nice but they actually removed parking to build it.  Last year I know someone that had paid for a parking pass and still had to park on grass in the main gym parking lot because of lack of space, than walk 10 min to class.   The student bar, \"the axe\", was just redone and is very good.  But I think the student council that approved it decided to pass on the privilege of the payments on to future students, again that is rumor and may be wrong.  The faculty are very good except for a handful of bad apples that you would find anywhere.  I find that they all care and actually want you to learn.  In some programs the class sizes can get very small so it is possible to actually change the pace of the class.  Last year the professor's almost went on strike/were locked out, it seems to be be getting worse with each cycle.  We are also one of the most expensive universities in Canada, if not the most.  \n\nWolfville is a decent little town with high taxes, and a small but busy downtown.  You can walk from one side of town to the other in about an hour and the taxis are cheap.  It also has a fair wack of the services that you will need like the two grocery stores, a hardware store, and a million dentists.  There have been jokes made that people from Wolfville are scarred of traffic lights because they refuse to upgrade the 4 way stop.  Also it should be known that Wolfville was known as mud creek till someone was too embarrassed to say they were from mud creek. They lied saying they were from wolfville and the rest of the town played along.\n\nWhat else do you need to know?  ",

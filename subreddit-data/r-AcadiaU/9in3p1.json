Chase, Cutten, Tower, Barrax (war memorial) have smaller blocks and would house a closer-knit community of lower numbers, but Dennis would be a larger 'entire floor' kind of mentality. Seminary was the same way, if not a little smaller hallways than Dennis. Your 'floor'/'section' becomes your deal. Sure, you meet other people, but your little microcosm is your world for first year.\n\nIt just depends how many you'd prefer to have in that little world. :)",

Great sense of community, both within each floor and among different floors too. Don't say you want a quiet floor, that's code for boring. Learned that the hard way. ",

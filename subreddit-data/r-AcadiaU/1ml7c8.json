Its schedule almost certainly wouldn't mesh nicely with your class schedule, though, and the cost would be prohibitive.\n\n&gt; Besides purchasing a car, is there a reliable way to go to Acadia while living in Halifax?

I know people without their own cars who lived in New Minas/Kentville and ended up moving into Wolfville because even that distance wasn't very workable.",

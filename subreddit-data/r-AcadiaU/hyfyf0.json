    "postText": "This is a pretty dead sub but I'm just wondering how the vibe around Gay and Trans people is in Acadia? I know it's in a pretty rural place but I would expect the acceptance to be pretty high considering that it's a college town and people from Halifax and Toronto come here. Am i gonna have a bad time or do people not really care? I'm a trans woman like 1 and a half ish years on hrt fyi.",

Elsewhere in the valley it's definitely less liberal but you'll probably be left alone as most of the people are typical Canadians.",

I even had a student who came back years later to get their diploma updated with their new name. That actually changed all references to them in the system, so my class lists from 10-15 years ago still have their old picture, but it is updated with their new name. \n\nThe town itself is fairly progressive.",

            "comment": "Just a heads up the Acadia pride club and really any official pride events around here are always super small, but that's more a function of the small population of Wolfville I think. In practice I find the Acadia student body to be very chill and accepting of all identities. Profs too, i personally haven't heard of anyone having issues with profs not respecting their identities. The closest would have been Rick mehta, who was just a blatantly intolerant person, but he got fired for being a shit prof lol.\n\nThere is a lovely Rainbow Chorus in Wolfville that's not affiliated with the university, but is a wonderful way to meet people if that's what you'd like. It's a bit of an older crowd, not many students, but I sang with them for a summer and found it to be a really nice environment.",

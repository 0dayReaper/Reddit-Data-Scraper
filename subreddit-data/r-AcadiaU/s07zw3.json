They seem to all have a pretty good crowd of people a lot of the time. \nAnd then the quietest Res\u2019s are Sem, Tully and Christopher. \n\nI like social atmosphere but am not a big partier and so Eaton was the perfect spot for me this year and I\u2019m going to Chase next year for a similar vibe!\nHope this helps",

Chase is harder to get into first year as a lot of second years try to get in cause it\u2019s mostly or all individual rooms.",

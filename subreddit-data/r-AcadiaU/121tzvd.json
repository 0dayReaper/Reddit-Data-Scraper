    "postText": "Wondering about the approximate course schedule for the MEd in Counselling program for the part time cohort. I know the courses that are taken each semester/ season, but I\u2019m looking for a more detailed breakdown, specifically for the fall, winter, and spring courses (for example, every second FRI/ SAT starting September 8th until \u2026 blah blah blah). I know that it\u2019s unlikely an identical schedule from year to year, I\u2019m just trying to get an idea. The only info online now is like, \u201cWinter 2024\u201d Thanks!",

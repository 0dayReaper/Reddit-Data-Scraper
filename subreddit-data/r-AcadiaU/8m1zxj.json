    "postText": "I remember Chipman in the early 90s and it was a bit of a party house then and the houses seemed to keep to themselves for the most part.  \n\nWith Kristopher and Eaton so close, is there more interaction between houses now?  Is it still considered more of a party house or is it more subdued? Is there a mix of years or is it mostly 1st and 2nd years?\n\nThanks",

We had some pretty big 100-150+ person parties in the basement until we took a light fixture down...twice..was more subdued after that as the main party room was closed for over a month and people turned 19.\n\ntl;dr still biggest party res on campus, mostly first years. ton of fun",

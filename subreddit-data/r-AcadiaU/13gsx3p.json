    "postText": "What's Up, Guys! I am a college student from North Carolina that runs an Instagram page and community called \"Woven Music Society\". While we have grown in my college town of Chapel Hill we want to expand the community to campuses everywhere. We aim to create an inclusive community for people to share new music and create connections. Every month we will have a new playlist for a variety of genres that are curated by our community. Everyone gets three submissions per genre. Those genres are Indie/Alternative, Hip-Hop/Rap, and Country/Roots! Those recommendations are then added to a Spotify playlist for all to enjoy! Attached is a link to our Spotify Page and LinkTree that you can use to submit your additions to our playlists! We are complete non-profit and nothing on any of our pages is monetized. Also, mods, If this is not allowed on this sub feel free to remove the post no hard feelings.\n\nMuch Love,\n\nWilliam from WMS\n\nLinkTree-[ https://linktr.ee/wovenmusicsociety](https://linktr.ee/wovenmusicsociety)\n\nSpotify-[https://open.spotify.com/user/31fu62xctmqh6ifihiesgagjknvq?si=176e4992170c4f31](https://open.spotify.com/user/31fu62xctmqh6ifihiesgagjknvq?si=176e4992170c4f31)",

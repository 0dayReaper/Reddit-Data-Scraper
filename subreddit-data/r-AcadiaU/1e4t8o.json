I'm also a TA for 2 KINE courses....HINT HINT",

I really have not talked to many people about any kind of university courses before, so some of these may be a little on the easy side of things for you.\n\nNumber one is about the applied biology class. What kind of content does it cover? Is it sort of like the follow up to the grade 12 bio class in high school? Are the labs long and arduous or are they interesting?\n\nTwo is about the actual program specific classes/profs. I always hear these stories from teachers about profs who just say \"Alright read these books and come back in 3 months to write the exam.\" I'm not expecting anything like that but I'm more wondering if there are there any professors that I should brace myself for or if they all pretty much decent and better? I've heard nothing but good things about Acadia so I'm not super concerned about this.\n\nThree, which courses do you assist in?\n\nPS, is there big forest culture at Acadia or is it a little on the small side?",

But if you are interested in some graduate programs it may be required. I took the first section of the intro bio course because for certain Physiotherapist programs you need one bio mark. The labs for Kine are only on select courses (Physiology, Biomechanics, Anatomy, etc) and most of the kine labs are actually all hands on, so obviously some of them are the best part of your courses. \n\nAs far as course specific profs in the kine department they are all generally awesome. The Kinesiology department I would say has some of the best professors that will remember your name, see you around town and say hi, or even strike up a conversation with you. I really think Acadia has one of the best and most hands on Kinesiology program in the Maritimes. Also, if you're not from Nova Scotia or the Valley area in Wolfville, the small town may be something to get use to, but the adoption process is very fast, and Wolfville will soon become your \"home\" in a sense. At least for me it did, It's a university town, but everyone has positive incentives and is generally good. \n\nAlso, I am a teacher's assistant for the Human Physiology Lab sections 1, and 2. As well as the Exercise Physiology Lab next year. However, those are both 2nd and 3rd year level courses so unfortunately I won't be marking a fellow redditor. \n\nForest as in??? hahah There's a ton of woods around Acadia and they have pretty sweet walking trails through the woods that is immediately behind the school and dorms. And to mention about Crowell tower, it's probably honestly one of the least preferred residences, but personally the rooms are pretty sweet, and it's the cheapest residence to live in, so if so fact to. \n\nI hope that answers some of your questions, sorry I took so long to reply, I was deep in the job searching ring.

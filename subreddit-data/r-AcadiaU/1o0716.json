    "postText": "I'm a high school student near Boston, Massachusetts, and I'm thinking about applying to Acadia. I have a few questions about the requirements to be accepted:\n\n* The AcadiaU website mentions taking 4 college preparatory classes in addition to English during Grade 12. Does that mean I need to take classes covering all the requisite subjects (science, math, history, etc.)? I will meet all the state requirements by graduation,  but I probably won't be taking any science classes in Grade 12 (unless you count AP Psych).\n\n* Do I need to submit SAT/ACT scores? What are the average scores for Acadia's accepted US students?\n\n* What GPA should I be shooting for? The website mentions a B overall average - does this include all four years or just Grade 12?\n\n* I'm interested in the Psychology program, which recommends that I take Precalculus. Unless I absolutely must take Pre-calc, I'm going to take Statistics instead. Will this be detrimental to my application?",

We started accepting applications for September 2014 start as of October 1st, so feel free to apply any time you are ready. \nFor Psychology we would look at applicants who have Grade 12 English and Grade 12 Academic or Advanced Math and 3 other college prep courses (we take your 3 highest courses into account). Pre-Cal is not required, Academic Mathematics is sufficient, however applicants are required to have taken Algebra 11. \nThe B average is our minimum required for admission - and only looks at those 5 courses we consider for admission. The average freshmen entering grade for us ranges between 84-86%.\nLastly, we don't require applicants from the US to submit SAT Scores, simply all we need is your high school transcript accompanied by a letter of reference from a school guidance counsellor, teacher or principal speaking to your academic strengths as well as any other qualities you would like us to know about.\nI would also recommend getting in touch with our US Enrolment Advisor Andrew Waters. You can reach him at andrew.waters@acadiau.ca. Andrew travels to the US a few times a year and if in your area, would love to connect with you!\nTake care and we hope to see you on campus one day soon!\n",

            "comment": "Generally, Acadia is pretty open to applications. For most Canadian students, pre-university courses are generally anything you don't really have to take in grade 12 to graduate high school in Canada. For Nova Scotia it was grade 12 math, chemistry, and/or biology. Or any additional math courses. I can't remember if the history courses are part of the courses that help with university applications. These pretty much open up your choices for other majors. I think they recommend pre-calculus as more of an aid in case you take courses that have a lot of math involved (eg physics). I can say it has helped me as a bio major (but I took the course at Acadia because I didn't take it in high school).\n\nYou can email admissions about your questions about what they usually accept for grades, and courses from the states for pre-university stuff as well. They are more than willing to help! ",

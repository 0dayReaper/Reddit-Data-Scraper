    "postText": "So I an international student thinking about applying to Acadia, Memorial N.F, and UVic but not settled on which to chooses if accepted to all for my masters of counseling.\n\nThe information I would like to know which seems better for the personality type of someone who can be a mix of introvert and extrovert. I don't mind partying but I want a single dorm space, as it pertains to the city or campus, I would prefer it to between busy and quiet (Not a ghost town but not like New York, US).\n\nIf there is another university that might better suit that description, which do you think it would be?\n\nAlso, what are the scholarship opportunities like for these schools?\n\nFinally, which had the best track and field program.",

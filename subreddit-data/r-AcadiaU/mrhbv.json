I'm interested in [Acadia's M.Sc. in Computer Science Co-op program](http://co-op.acadiau.ca/co-op-in-master-of-science-in-computer-science.html).\n\n1. What's campus life like at Acadia?\n2. What are some cultural faux pas at Acadia?\n3. According to Wikipedia, Acadia has/had a lot of ties with Baptism. Does religion still play a big part on campus? Are the majority of students religious?\n4. What fields of CS is Acadia's CS department known for?\n5. I noticed a lot of your CS co-op students went to Ottawa or Waterloo for jobs. Are there not many IT-related opportunities in the area? (I did one of my co-op workterms in Halifax so I know there's opportunities there, but anywhere else?)\n6.

            "comment": "SUPER LONG ANSWERS because I assume you can't make it out here! I answer these questions all the time, because I do campus tours here. Let me know if you can make it out and I'll set you up with a tour, or give it myself! (Also, I am **NOT PAID** by the university, nor do I receive any benefits, just to make that clear. I'm writing what I'm writing purely as a student here.)\n\n&gt; What's campus life like at Acadia?\n\nWay better than I expected. With students, it's about 7000 people here in Wolfville, roughly half of whom are students. Lots of really great spots in town to hang out, whatever your taste is \u2013\u00a0live music, DJs, gastropubs, fine dining (French, Contemporary World, bistro, etc.), diners, karaoke (!), open mics. There's a lovely tiny little bar above a restaurant called Library Pub (aka LibPub) which is where a lot of grad students hang out. Great place to hang out with your friends, and they have a band once or twice a week who tend to be really good. Campus itself has loads of great, beautiful study spots. Have you seen photos of our [Garden Room](http://www.housenumbers.ca/IrvingGardenRoom.jpg)? It's always quiet and there's a fireplace that stays lit for the winter. \n\n&gt; What are some cultural faux pas at Acadia?\n\nNova Scotians are super friendly compared to people from Ontario. (I'm from Ontario.) So the main thing that surprises people new to the Valley is how friendly people are! Also, being a small town, you run into people a lot. It's polite to say hey to anyone you know when you see 'em around. I can't think of anything else really East-Coast specific\u2026you don't have as much anonymity here, so I guess the only thing that might bother you is that it's a bit harder to hide? But you're an islander, I imagine you're used to that type of thing maybe. :)\n\n&gt; According to Wikipedia, Acadia has/had a lot of ties with Baptism. Does religion still play a big part on campus? Are the majority of students religious?\n\nNope nope nope nope nope. It was *founded* by Baptists to be Nova Scotia's first non-religious school, actually. It's in our original charter\u2026at the time, Baptists were excluded from every other school in NS, so local Baptist lumberjacks built Acadia as volunteers, with donated materials, to be the first school open to anyone of \"good moral standing\", regardless of religion. It's never been a Baptist school and still isn't. The number of religious students here is very similar to national average and will be the same as you're accustomed to seeing at Brock. We have a small chapel (not church) on campus, as is common for most Canadian universities, that offers services to members of all faiths 7 days a week, similar to the chapel you find in most Canadian hospitals and on almost all campuses. That's it, though. No religious affiliation, plays no real role on campus. \n\n&gt; What fields of CS is Acadia's CS department known for?\n\nThis, I couldn't tell you. Take a look at the [courses we offer](http://central.acadiau.ca/registrar/course_catalog?disc=COMP&amp;procyr=2011) though and maybe that'll help. If you have questions or want to talk to a prof or the head of the department, email Sharon at sharon.watson@acadiau.ca \u2013 she's the admin assistant for the CS department and will put you in touch with the person you need. The head of the department will almost *definitely* be happy to give you a call and chat. That's Acadia for ya.\n\n&gt; I noticed a lot of your CS co-op students went to Ottawa or Waterloo for jobs. Are there not many IT-related opportunities in the area? (I did one of my co-op workterms in Halifax so I know there's opportunities there, but anywhere else?)\n\nThere are jobs in the Valley, but not many\u2026this is not a tech area. Halifax has a lot more and is only an hour away, so lots of people work there and commute by car. Otherwise, yeah, you're best going to Toronto or Waterloo or maybe Ottawa. \n\n&gt; Can you give a rough estimate of how many international students you have (e.g. a percentage of the student population)?\n\n14% international students, so about 400. \n\n&gt; Is the public transit any good? Or is there no need because everything is in walking distance?\n\nWithin Wolfville, nothing's more than a 15-20 minute walk. We have a supermarket, two pharmacies, four hair salons, a big Home Hardware, a big Shoppers Drug Mart, 6-10 restaurants and bars, a convenience store, a video rental place, several bookstores (new and used), a one-screen cinema that shows documentaries and foreign films (going out in 2 hours tonight to see a Gaelic comedy!), a few big dollar stores, and all your essentials really. The only thing we don't have here is a tech shop and clothes. For those, you're gonna head to New Minas which is 10 minutes drive or 30 minutes on the bus, which is hourly and $3 (King's Transit). It's got ALL the big-box stores: Wal-Mart, Future Shop (everything tech), Michael's (art supply), huge supermarkets, a few shopping malls with clothes, etc. etc. \u2013 really everything. And then Halifax is 1.5 hours on the bus (Acadian Lines), or 1.25 hour's driving. Bus is $33 roundtrip for students and leaves from Halifax and Wolfville twice a day, every day (three times on Friday). You can also get the bus to and from the airport, also twice a day, for a few dollars more. \n\n&gt; Do most students live on-campus or off-campus?\n\nRoughly 1/3 to 1/2 of students live on campus. That said, I think most grad students live off campus. A single room is about $450-600/mth in Wolfville, and will be less than a ten minute walk from campus and downtown, generally. If you want your own bathroom and kitchen, it's closer to $800. I live off-campus and share my washroom with three other people, but have my own room. It's $500/month and 60 seconds to campus. \n\n&gt; I cherish the close relationships I have with the faculty here at Brock. Most professors know of work that I've done outside of class. Acadia boasts about its small size, but does it actually have the small size benefits?\n\nYes. Two illustrations: in my first month here, I bumped into a prof at the grocery store. She came to say hi, knew me by name already, and I asked if I could set up a meeting with her about a concern I had over a term paper. She insisted that we just talk about it right then and there, which we did. \n\nAlso, each department has a club (Sociology Club, CSci Club, PoliSci Club, etc.) and those clubs have various social events for anyone involved in the department, even if you're only taking one course in that subject. Around Thanksgiving, PoliSci club had a house party featuring hot chocolate, apple cider, wine, cheese and a movie. About 50 people showed up\u2026including 1/2 or 2/3 of the PoliSci profs. They didn't have to be there. They weren't paid to be there. They came *just because they genuinely wanted to spend more time with their students*. \n\nOkay, long answer! Hope that helps. Let me know if you have more questions. Hell, if you want, message me and I'll give you my phone # and we can have a chat. Cheers!",

We do have a few more \u2013 Clark Commons comes to mind, the greenhouses, the botanical gardens and University Hall are all very lovely. Of course, many of our academic buildings were built in the 1970s and look it. But so be it. Obviously we market ourselves using our most attractive buildings.

It's got a real small town vibe and there's something for every one. If you're a party-er you won't be disappointed (look into Chipman, Tower, Eaton) but if you'd rather some peace and quiet there are quiet sections in almost all residences and some whole buildings that are more strict when it comes to noises and disturbances. (Roy Jodrey, Chase, Whitman [girls only])\n\nI can't really think of any faux pas off the top of my head. I'm sure there are a few but nothing really huge.\n\nThere is a church right in the middle of campus. I don't know anything about it other than the bell goes off at odd times and twice during one of my classes. I wouldn't say that religion plays a big part in the school at all. There is a divinity college but I've only ever seen two or three people ever enter or exit the place. If I were to guess I'd say the majority of students are atheist/agnostic it's not something I discuss often with people. I do have two or three friends who are practicing Christians so if you want to know about other churches in the area I could get some info. There is also a number of Muslim students.\n\nI'd put the percent of internationals at about %20-30.\n\nIf anything is unclear or you have more questions I'll try to help\n",

Generally people live in residence in their first and second year and move into an off campus apartment for third and fourth year. If someone does stay in residence for third and fourth year they usually live in Rojo (Roy Jodrey) which is made up mostly of upper years and older people returning to school for a degree.\n\nI can't speak for the CS program but I know in my program (Music) most of the professors know my name (even some that I've never had as a professor) but I know in some of the larger programs (Science, Math, etc.) the professors are not as close with their students.

Is this too much Jim Diamond for one semester? Thanks!",

It is a lot of proofs and the like. OS is always a lot of work, but not as much as Programming 3, from what I understand.\n\nDr. Silver will most likely not be teaching SE 2 next year, as he is on tap to take over as acting director for the year (covering a sabbatical - this is not completely confirmed yet, but very likely to happen.) So it depends on who is going to be teaching that course how difficult it is going to be. \n\nAI is not a bad course. \n\nIn general, you can pull this off if you keep up on your assignments and make sure that you get all of the work done on the soon side. It is an advantage that Dr Diamond will be teaching both A of A and OS, as you won't get major assignments and midterms on the same day in both of those classes. \n\nBut that is just my opinion. Would love to hear what anyone else has to say.\n",

I just had him for SE1 and he's been really great, I'm pretty confident that most of the people in the class thought he did a good job. Just a student's perspective for you.",

That makes it no harder than Computer Programming 3, but it will still be a lot of work \u2013 as will be OS. I found those three courses to be the most rewarding in my degree, but as you've no doubt found in 2103, they're all a lot of work. If you can afford to put one of them off until another semester, I'd recommend it. Get some other bird courses out of the way.",

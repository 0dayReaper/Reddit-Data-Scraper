            "comment": "There are a few options, although they would be through Computer Science as opposed to Engineering. \n\nThe Computer Science Society holds \"Computer and Coding Help\" (CaCHe) sessions on Wednesdays and Thursdays in the CS student lounge (Carnegie 209/210) between 3 and 5pm. You can drop by there and ask for some help. You can also contact the CS Society to see if they have anyone who is willing to help tutor. (The CS C class isn't until the winter term, so there may be a number of CS tutors that just haven't registered yet.)\n\nI would also suggest a meeting with your prof and/or the TAs for your class. They should be able to help. \n\nGood luck. If you don't find someone to help you, then send me a PM and I'll see if I can line up a private tutor for you.",

I used it during my CS intro courses back in the mid-90s, and it remains my personal gold-standard of what an instructional textbook should be!\n\nThe Acadia library doesn't have a copy, but Dal does. You could always request an [interlibrary loan](https://library.acadiau.ca/borrow/interlibrary-loans.html). Alternatively, previous editions of the book can be had via Amazon for less than $35.\n\nGood luck!",

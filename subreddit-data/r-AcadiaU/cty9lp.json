The doom and gloom about climate change can\u2019t be ignored, but negativity simply doesn\u2019t motivate us - the conversation must be changed to hope and action.   \n\n\nThis event begins with an interactive and informative overview of climate change in Canada, creative and out-of-the box ideas about what individuals can do to reduce their emissions; and it will end providing an understanding of how collective action can make a big difference.   \n\n\nThis event will leave you feeling there is hope for change - and it will be the reason you either start, restart or continue your sustainability journey with more ambition than ever before.  \n\n\nDate:   \nSeptember 13, 2019  \n3:00 PM - 4:00 PM  \n\n\nLocation:   \nAcadia University  \nStudent Union Building - Michener Lounge  \n30 Highland Ave  \nWolfville  \nNS B4P 2R6  \n\n\nThis event is open to the community and all are welcome to join! \"  \n\n\n[Facebook Event Link](https://www.facebook.com/events/357844151773633/)  \n\n\n[Facebook.com/randomactsofgreen](https://www.facebook.com/randomactsofgreen/)\n\n[Instagram: @randomactsofgreen](https://www.instagram.com/randomactsofgreen/)\n\n[Twitter: @randomactsgreen](https://twitter.com/randomactsgreen?lang=en)\n\n[Download our APP - \"Random Acts of Green\" Available Now](https://raog.ca/)",

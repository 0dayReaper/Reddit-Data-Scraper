            "comment": "Technically it is a certificate for part-time students who want credentials in computer science. It was popular back in the day when people got CS jobs with no formal training, but then needed a formal certificate to back up their experience. So if you were looking to do a number of part-time or online courses in the CS field, then this would be an option. Note: we don't provide the certificate for full-time students, as they would normally just take a second major in COMP.",

I was originally planning on going into an IT course at NSCC for the same reason, to get good grades and then apply to undergraduate studies. Could this be an alternative if I was accepted into it?",

Those courses would count towards an undergrad degree. Courses from NSCC might prepare you for university, but the courses don\u2019t always transfer. \n\nIf you are serious about the first programming course in the series (programming 1 - comp 1113) the it isn\u2019t too late to start this year.",

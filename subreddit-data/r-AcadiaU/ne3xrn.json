            "comment": "Yes, it's a great school. The people you learn from will be well regarded in their field, the class sizes will be small enough that they will actually know you and form personal connections with you rather than you just being a number, and the social side will be fun enough to be fun, without being so out of control that you lose track of why you are there. If you come off the rails you are supported rather than forgotten about.\n\nUnlike going to a school in a big city where there are thousands of distractions, going to Acadia means living in a town where everyone your age is there for broadly the same reason - because they are a student. This means everyone is on the same page compared to big city life.\n\nSource - lived in the 416 before going to Acadia, have done a couple more degrees at different schools since. 4 years at Acadia (two in rez incl as RA, two off campus) = some of the most rewarding, enjoyable and peaceful years of my life. The teaching/learning/student life experience at Acadia really is top notch.",

I mean, it's still thousands of people, but it's just more personal. The one thing that is critical to understand is that big universities often get a lot of credit and brand value from their research work - which is all fine and dandy if you are doing your PhD working on some groundbreaking molecular biology work that needs a multi-million dollar piece of equipment, but it says nothing of the everyday undergraduate experience. Acadia does the undergraduate experience really well.",

The nice thing about a small town is that everyone knows each other... the cops are pretty hard to piss off, and there's not a huge amount of crime. We lived in the same house for two years and I don't think we locked the front door once in those two years except maybe over the Christmas break.\n\nOther local towns (e.g. New Minas, Kentville etc) have decent amenities too if need be. If you have a car you will be fine. Would be a bit different without wheels I imagine.",

            "comment": "the student life is pretty varied. in general, there's something there for everyone, whether you're more academically or socially minded, but in general its pretty fun while not being so overwhelming that you would get lost in it, like you might at a bigger school.\n\nas for the residences, it depends on which one you choose. cutten (mostly for first years), chase, and chip are party residences, and there's usually parties going on in there (at least pre-pandemic. im not rlly a partier so im not sure what the situation is like now). i live in seminary and its pretty quiet, but its right next to the music building so there are a lot of music students who live here - you'll hear students playing their instruments during the day, but they're generally pretty respectful at night. i know that barrax/war memorial and tully/whitman are pretty quiet too, but tully is a female-only residence, and barrax is pretty far from the action on campus. im not too sure about the other residences, but they're probably on the quiet side too.\n\ni love the small university atmosphere! having professors who actually know who i am is a huge help for my adhd and just general mental health. the small-town feeling is pretty great, too. it's super friendly and safe here. like others have said, its better if you have a car to get to halifax/the other towns around since there isn't much here other than a few restaurants and bars in the way of entertainment. the public transport is basically nonexistent its so unreliable. but i don't have a car and i do pretty okay here in terms of entertainment - then again, i don't party, and i have friends with cars who are willing to give me a ride as long as im willing to cover gas money.\n\nin general, im so glad i chose acadia over the bigger schools i got accepted into.",

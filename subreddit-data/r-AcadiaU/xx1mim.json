    "postText": "I was looking into the different residences at Acadia, but I wanted to know what res would be the best for first years (at least for me). I will be an international student, so I don't wanna deal with damage fees or anything of that sort. I would like a res where its easy to socialize with people and make friends, but also one where I could get a peaceful sleep at night.",

Tight knit community there in my experience. It's also the closest residence to the gym if you're planning on spending time there.",

I liked that meal hall was further away, it made us all travel together more since it felt like a burden to get there. Realistically though, everything is close no matter where you live on campus.\n\nEdit: The whole campus is on a hill, you will have classes at the bottom of the hill. So if you're going from class to meal hall, or if you live at the top of the hill, like Tower you're still walking a lot. There's no avoiding walking uphill a lot tbh.",

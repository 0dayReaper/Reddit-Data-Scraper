Majority of people though aren\u2019t partying crazy hard or doing drugs, but if you go looking for it you can find it. \nThere are options for alcohol free sections in Cutten I believe as well. \n\nIn terms of a well-balanced res that\u2019s social but fairly quiet generally, Christofor would be a good option. You get the benefit of being in the quad, but Eaton is usually a bit louder.",

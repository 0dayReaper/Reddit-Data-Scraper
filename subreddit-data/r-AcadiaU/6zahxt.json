    "postText": "So I've been down to the squash courts twice so far with my friend but we kinda wanna play/meet new people so I'm thinking of putting up a sheet by the far courts for people to put their names and phone number if they feel like playing other people. \n If things go really well we had a pyramid type thing going on at the Kentville Squash club if people would like a little friendly competition! Anyway, I will post that poster by the squash doors!\n\nPS: if you are interested in squash but don't have any gear or know the rules I have a spare Raquect and balls if you want me to show you the basics!\n\nTLDR: Beginning Squash community.

            "comment": "Ive found that living on residence when you are older is a bad experience. The residence program doesn\u2019t provide any independence and you feel like you are being treated like a child. Having to fill out a form and ask permission every time you want a friend/significant other to stay the night gets old fast. On the other hand, paying 100s of dollars extra every year because some freshmen can\u2019t resist punching holes in the walls also gets old quick.\n\n\n\n\n\nOff campus is so much cheaper than residence in comparison with what you get, you can get a similar sized room with all utilities included for 400-500/month. And that\u2019s not even considering the overpriced, mandatory rip off they call the \u201cmeal plan\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nDont get me wrong it\u2019s a great experience when you are a first year moving out of your parents house for the first time, but there is a reason everyone moves out after their second year.",

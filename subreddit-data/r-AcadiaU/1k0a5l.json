I'm an older undergraduate student to Acadia this year and I know Acadia is (for the most part) and undergraduate university so the student body is mostly early twenties. Are there any hangouts where the graduate students/older students go?\n\n\nThanks!",

That's where most of the graduate students/older students go during breaks (at least in my department) and you could meet people in your program and build from there. \n\nIf you do end up going out for a drink, Paddies has less of a first/second year crowd (although Monday nights are always going to be packed for open mike nights). Paddies is probably the best place to meet locals/students of a variety of ages. \n\nThe farmers market is also a good idea. Keep in mind, Wolfville is a small town so you're going to find young and old students everywhere, but Paddies and the Farmers Market are probably your best bet!\n\nOh and The Naked Crepe for dinner. The pizza is amazing, it's cheap, and a variety of people go there :)\n",

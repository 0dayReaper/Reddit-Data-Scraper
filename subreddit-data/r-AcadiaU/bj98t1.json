Is it difficult to get into the program? I got a GPA of 8.1 on a 10 point scale, but got no experience. Is it good enough for getting an admit? If you can please share the details, it would be an immense help.",

In terms of job prospects you're probably gonna have to move to a different province because ns is pretty dry when it comes to jobs in general",

I've heard mixed things (good and bad about the profs for the courses). I'm not really sure if Acadia even offers a master's program in comp sci, let alone what it is like, personally for the Masters degree I would maybe consider Dalhousie (you could still do the undergrad here though). I would say a possible down side of attending a school like Acadia would be if you are looking to work out of the Atlantic provinces, Acadia isn't all that well regarded (but if you are looking for a master's degree, it doesn't really matter where your bachelor degree is from. I have no idea what the job market is like for computer science, but one possible advantage is that you get to know the profs pretty well here at Acadia, so research positions/ asking them for resources is always an option. Your grade should be more then fine for entrance. I think Acadia only needs something like a 70 average so you're golden :). If you have any more questions feel free to pm me",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm moving to NS this fall while my wife attends Acadia. We've been looking for apartments in the Annapolis Valley, and it seems like every single place has a \"no pets\" policy. There's already limited options when it comes to rentals, and every place I've contacted so far has turned me down due to my cats. They're less than 20lbs between them; what harm could they actually do? \n\nIf anyone has any tips on where to look or pet-friendly 2-3 bedroom places, I'd love to hear from you!",

            "comment": "I went through this long ago when looking for a place, but I quickly found that \"no pets\" mostly meant \"no dogs\" and did okay living in wolfville with cats, you just need to ask when they say \"no pets\".",

            "comment": "I would speak to potential landlords because a lot of them will make exceptions for cats. My apartment is not \"pet friendly\" but my landlord allowed me to move in with my cat if I paid a $300 pet deposit that he carried through to my next lease \\(same landlord, different apartment\\). Most of them are worried about irresponsible students allowing the pet to claw everything up which is fair but most will make exceptions if you're older or prove to be responsible. \n\nRiverview court apartments are pet friendly \\(I have a friend who lived there with her cat\\) and they're pretty decent and quiet. Hope this helps! ",

            "comment": "Let's be honest... pets can be an issue for landlords.  Dogs can be loud resulting in noise complaints.  Cats can spray or claw up carpets.  And pets can be quite messy too.  Once you take the potential damages, cleanup and other risks into account it's not surprising that most landlords don't want them.  Good luck in your search.",

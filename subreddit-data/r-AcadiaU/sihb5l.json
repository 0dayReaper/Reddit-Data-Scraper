    "postText": "I recently applied to the biology program at  AcadiaU and I heard it is a co-op program. Can anyone tell me if I could pay some of my tuition fees by doing Co-op and What are the job opportunities for a student completing an undergrad in biology from AcadiaU? Will I be able to pursue a graduate degree in microbiology if I do a bachelor's in biology?",

            "comment": "I can answer your question about tuition fees. All co-op jobs done through the co-op program are real jobs with real companies, and you get paid based on the job that you do. Students have received jobs that range anywhere from minimum wage to $30/h, and that money is theirs to do with what they wish. Many students who do co-op end up graduating with lower/no student loans because they were able to use the money that they made on their co-op work terms to pay for school. \n\nAs for the other questions, there are many students who take an undergrad in biology and get graduate degrees (including PhDs), so it shouldn't be a problem to do a microbiology graduate degree with an undergrad from Acadia. You should ask for advice from your faculty advisor to make sure that you take the needed courses in your upper years (I believe that the first year classes are all the same). \n\nI hope this helps.",

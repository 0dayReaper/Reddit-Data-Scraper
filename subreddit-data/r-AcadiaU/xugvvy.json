            "comment": "Acadia uses a 4.33 grading system whereas UofT uses a 4.00 grading system. If you want a 4.00 GPA at Acadia (A average) I'd say it's pretty manageable if you're a good student. A perfect 4.33 (A+) GPA might not be realistic though, especially if you are planning to take English or similar courses where grading is more subjective. I have close to a 4.33 GPA and I am in Science at Acadia (not bio). It takes a lot of work but it isn't impossible. The bio core is not extremely difficult and since it's the largest program, there are many available courses meaning you have the freedom to choose courses you are good at. I agree that having a near-perfect GPA at Acadia is easier than U of T. I am wondering why you are looking to achieve a perfect GPA though. I learned the most in the courses I didn't get A+s in. I am planning to go into dentistry so my GPA is important to me, but I also want to earn my GPA and take courses that challenge me and interest me (i.e. don't guarantee me A+'s), not merely \"bird\" courses.",

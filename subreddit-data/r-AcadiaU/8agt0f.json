    "postText": "Hey guys, \nI'm moving to Wolfville for my undergrad, I've been considering getting a gaming PC. I wanted to know if it's easier to get parts shipped to Wolfville or if there are computer centers around?  Would it be more convenient to buy a pre-built through amazon and have it shipped to Wolfivlle? \nThanks for any opinions! ",

Amazon does ship but they don't always get it here in the 2 days that is promised.  How fast it gets here depends on who ships it and how.  Stuff coming from Hong Kong take weeks or months and tend to come through the post while stuff coming from the USA gets here in about 2 weeks more or less, through the post.  If amazon has it in stock it will come via courier and should not take more than a week.     Canada is not small and is relatively not densely populated causing shipping to be more expansive than other countries.   ",

    "postText": "I'm in highschool, and it's that time to start serious looking at universities. As of right now, my choices are Acadia and Dal. I'm looking to take commerce, then apply to law school. My question is how is the commerce program at Acadia? Also I'm kinda a fan of the city, is the valley slow? Or are there things to do? I'm trying to find out as much as I can so I can make an informed decision. Thanks in advance.",

When I came to Acadia I was a bit nervous about leaving the city for such a small town. Now, two years later, I must admit that I love Wolfville. I mean of course I miss the city from time to time, but Acadia has such an amazing and supportive community that you just can't get in the city. I couldn't imagine doing my undergrad anywhere else! There are always events on campus going on, and so many clubs to join. ",

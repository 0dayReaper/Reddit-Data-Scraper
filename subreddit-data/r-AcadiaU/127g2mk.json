If anyone could help me out with deciding I\u2019d be super appreciative. Thanks!",

The storage is also GREAT and. the laundry room and kitchen is huge. As of right now though, the bathrooms are pretty scary. Sem looks a lot nicer but is more money and less storage. Both places have bathrooms without locks so many people can use it at the same time. \n\nTower is also closer to meal hall, but sem is at the heart of campus.",

Go to residence for a year, make some friends and move off campus or become an RA. I graduated at 25, it makes no difference. Once you are in your 20s everyone is the same age anyways, you're all adults.  It's not like high school where a year or two makes a huge difference in maturity. Some of your new friends will be 20, some will be 25, some may even be 28. I've become great friends with people who were in their early 30s when they started their BA. Don't let your age stop you for a second, you're still a pup. Go get it done and have a blast, you won't regret it. Acadia is awesome. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions about anything Acadia related.",

He doesn't seem to regret it because he feels the career he'll get out of being here will be better for him.\n\nIt's really all about why you want to go to university. You'll get back into the swing of school before you know it, and your professors will be way different from your teachers in high school.\n\nI would also recommend Tower. The building's out dated but I lived there for two years and it was good to me. If you get there and hate it it's pretty easy to move into another res.",

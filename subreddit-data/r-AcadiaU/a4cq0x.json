Do I have an okay chance of getting in? Is it competitive? ",

Having a project and supervisor in mind and with a solid road map or developed thesis will go a long way to getting into the program.\n\nI loved my time at Acadia, especially with the faculty in the English department. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have - feel free to PM me. ",

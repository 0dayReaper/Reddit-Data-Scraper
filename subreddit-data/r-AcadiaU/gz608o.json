The walk isn't bad - only 2-3 minutes further than Dennis or Chase - but some people think that it is far only because it is that little bit further from everything else. Having said that, the views (particularly to the North) are great.",

Common issues include: people shitting in bags and microwaving it, loud people, leaking windows. \nThe building is super old, and as someone who's in the military now, the barracks I've lived in have been better. \nMy mother has worked at Acadia for nearly 40 years, and you couldn't pay me to stay in Crowell. It's a maintenance nightmare. \n\nAlso that flood video, that happens, a lot. That video is 20 years old too. They never caught who did it or who did it again following. A lot of people's stuff gets ruined and you may not get to replace it.",

I don't know if there is a non-alcohol section though, but there were never any parties at chris when I was there. Also, the deluxe single rooms are quite big and you get a double bed, so that's a win.\n\nDefinite NOs would be: Chipman, Dennis, probably Cutten, Tower, maybe Eaton (they were a bit more party active than christofor)\n\nOther decent choices are barrax and sem. Sometimes first years can get into roy jodrey, which is mostly upper year and fairly quiet from what I remember. I'd check the acadia residences page and see what you prefer :) Seminary is the most centrally located, chris and roy jodrey are both in the quad, close to meal hall but across campus from the arts building. That being said, it's a small campus. \n\nOne piece of advice I can offer from my personal experience, though, is not to be too set on a quiet, party free zone. Of course I don't know you or your personality, but I was convinced I'd be happier in a quiet residence. I ended up pretty isolated and miserable, no one interacted on my floor and I made no friends (and residence is pretty much your pool of people you'll befriend). Again, this is my experience, so do what's best for you!! \n\nGood luck at Acadia, it's a great environment :)",

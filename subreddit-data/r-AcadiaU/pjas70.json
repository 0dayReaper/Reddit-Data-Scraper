            "comment": "There is lots of parking on campus, especially at the gym. It is sometimes difficult to get parking close to the building that you want, but there is *always* parking at the gym. There is no place in town where you can really park for the day without running into issues, so campus is your best bet. \n\nNote that there is a free parking lot on the top of campus by Tower (top left on this map: https://www2.acadiau.ca/files/files/Files%20~%20Security/CampusMap.pdf)\n\nI don't know how full the free parking lot gets on a regular basis. \n\nAcadia has switched to HotSpot parking, so best to get that working on your phone before you arrive. \n\nNote: I've been parking on campus for the past 18 years, and never once in those 18 years have I not been able to find a parking spot at the gym. :)",

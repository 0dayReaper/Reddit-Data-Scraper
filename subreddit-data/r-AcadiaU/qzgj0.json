If you haven't heard them yet, check them out, and even if you have, get a glimpse of their sexy new website (above)!\n\nFind the Facebook event and join if you're in the area - they've got a lot of awesome things planned. If you aren't in the area, they're broadcasting the whole event (it's 24 hours of antics!), and you can show your support online!",

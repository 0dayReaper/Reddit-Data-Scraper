    "postText": "Hey Guys! So I have been offered a place in Ucalgary and Acadia in computer science for next fall. However I can't chose from them. They both have good reputations, but I'm leaning toward Acadia. \n\nRegardless of all other factors(student body, town, class size, money, etc), which one should I go for? And is Acadia cs program qualify you the same as U calgary?\n\nAlso, if anyone here studies cs at Acadia can you tell me how strong the department is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you guys",

            "comment": "It really depends on what you are looking for in a University. Calgary is a big school in a big city, and Acadia is a small school in a small town. The major differences are going to be in the lifestyle between the two. \n\nFrom an education perspective, Calgary is going to offer more sections of more courses, mainly because they have the size and faculty to do so. Acadia will be a bit more restricted this way - they will offer fewer courses and fewer sections, mainly because they are smaller. \n\nHaving said that, the bulk of courses that you will take in Computer Science at Acadia will be taught by full-time, tenure-track faculty members. There are very few courses that are taught by part-time faculty or grad students, and those part-time faculty that do cover courses are often people who have been teaching part-time at Acadia for a while. The reduced number of faculty at Acadia can be bad - if there is a faculty member who has a teaching style that you don't jive with, there is a good chance that you will get them for another course somewhere else in your degree. On the flip side, Acadia profs will figure out who you are and will know your name. Office hours with profs are exactly that - office hours where you get to see the actual prof, not one of a half-dozen TAs.\n\nFrom the perspective of first year, Acadia teaches Python and Java. Class sizes for each of these will be around 50 students for Python in the fall, maybe 60 or so for Java in the winter. If you have previous programming experience, you can take both these courses in the fall, and take a systems programming course using C in the winter. The typical math courses are also required in first year. Average course sizes will be less than 50 for all of the second year and above COMP courses. \n\nThe Acadia BCS degree is accredited by the Canadian Information Processing Society, so you are going to end up with a quality education at the end. I am not sure if Calgary is accredited, but they probably are. \n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know. I'm the Director of the Jodrey School of Computer Science at Acadia, so I can tell you more about Acadia's CS program than the Calgary program.",

How much does the CS program and the faculty in general help in AI in specific.\n\n3) What awards and scholarships are given to continuing students, with high achieving profile, in the subsequent years. I know it is a bit off topic\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05, but I need to budget ahead as I\u2019m an international student and my budget is a bit limited.\n\nThank you!",

                            "comment": "\n&gt; 1)During the co-op, what major companies do I get to intern at?\n\nWith co-op, you apply for the program at the beginning of your second year, and you take some workshops during the term (resume writing, interviewing skills, etc). In the winter term, companies post jobs through the co-op office. You apply for these jobs with those companies. So if the company likes your resume, and you interview well, and your marks are good, then you get hired. These are paying jobs, so they are not \"guaranteed\". We don't have unpaid internships where you are just placed with a company. Our placement rate is pretty high (over 85%), so the chances of getting a job are good, but is depends on which jobs you apply for.\n\n&gt; 2) I look forward to specialize and research in AI. How much does the CS program and the faculty in general help in AI in specific.\n\nA good number of our faculty members did their PhDs in the AI field, and continue to research in that area. Their current areas of research are intelligent agents, data analytics, etc. We require one AI course to graduate, but there is a second AI course that is offered in alternating years, and a data analytics course that is also offered on a semi-regular basis. One of our faculty members runs the Acadia Institute of Data Analytics, so there is research and work with local companies going on there. \n\n\n&gt; 3) What awards and scholarships are given to continuing students, with high achieving profile, in the subsequent years. I know it is a bit off topic\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05, but I need to budget ahead as I\u2019m an international student and my budget is a bit limited.\n\nMost of our scholarships are handed out by the scholarships office. There are a couple of ones that I deal with, and they often have restrictions such as \"financial need\", or \"resident of the Annapolis Valley\", and there are other requirements depending on program and things like that. The rest would come out of the scholarships office, so I don't really know much about those. We do have some renewing scholarships and bursaries. Sorry that I am not much help with this, as I don't usually handle the money side. \n\nI hope this helps.",

            "comment": "I can't speak for the computer science side of things , but I can speak to some other factors such as Acadia's alumnus in my experience is passionate about the school and helping students get into companies and jobs. I know you said setting aside the other factors but I really don't think those can be overlooked, I was accepted to both Queens (for commerce) and Acadia for business and the smaller class sizes make a huge difference, my friends who go to Queens and McGill said they've never talked to their prof and they don't email back all that quickly, although here most profs will know you're name and are generally more than happy to write you reference and connect you with those in the industry than profs at a larger school like UClagary. I also have a few friends in the Comp Sci program here and they have mostly liked the program. Sorry I can't help more with the Comp Sci side, but if you have any other questions about other things I'm more than willing to answer :)",

Halifax is the closest city and it's about an hour away if you're going in a car, but the Maritime Bus takes longer. I've only been to Halifax a handful of times usually to compete in Case competitions, but Halifax is the big shopping centre for NS, and it has some different bars and clubs as well as different dining options if that's your cup of tea.",

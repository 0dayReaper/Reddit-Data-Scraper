    "postText": "I am a new student curious to know the interest in golf. I know St. Mary's and UNBC both have decent golf teams and UNBC made it to the Canadian University/College Championship. Would anybody know the possibility if there was enough interest of course that Acadia would be eligible to compete in Atlantic University golf competition? I am a decent golfer and would love to compete at a University level! Thank you in advance for you comments and replies. ",

We commonly get more snow than Halifax, and I'd say your average winter day would be about 0 to -10 Celsius . It can get as low as -20 (plus windchill), but it's not super frequent. Walking up and down the hill to meal hall can get windy but it's over pretty quick. \n\nI'd say the really cold times of year range from mid December to March, but our weather is very inconsistent.\n\nThe rest of the year is pretty mild out here. Fall and Summer tend to be fairly warm (better than the rest of the province ) and Spring isn't too bad either, but quite wet. \n\n",

But if you're comparing to tropical/equatorial countries...and that's all you're used to...be prepared for a bit of of a shock.  Your first truly cold days where it's snowing, windy, -20, and you gotta walk from one corner of campus to the other is gonna seem unbearable.  But you do quickly get used to it.  Not that it stops feeling cold, you just get better at dealing with it.  Best advice is removable layers.  2 or 3 socks, pants tucked in socks, shirt tucked in pants, 2nd shirt over pants tucked into 2nd pants, jacket, coat, hat, 2 layers of gloves.  Sounds ridiculous but it'll get the job done.  Oh and you'll learn to love hot drinks if you don't already.",

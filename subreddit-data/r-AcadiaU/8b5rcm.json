    "postText": "Hello, I'm an international student looking into Acadia. I'm half black and half japanese. I was wondering how diverse the university is. Culturally I am north american since I lived in America before and went to American international schools. I'm an extremely outgoing guy and love to party. Do you think I would have any problem fitting in because of my race since I heard the student population is very white. Thank you.",

Now, I haven't been a student there in about 20 years, so things could well have changed, but when I was there there were a fair number of people from China in the CS program at least.  There were also a bunch of Bermudans in my circles.\n\nSo, if 20 year old anecdotes are useful to you, there was at least some different ethnicities there.\n\nHelping somewhat, the \"at a glance\" [page](https://www2.acadiau.ca/about-acadia/at-a-glance.html) says that 11% of the freshman class is \"international\" students",

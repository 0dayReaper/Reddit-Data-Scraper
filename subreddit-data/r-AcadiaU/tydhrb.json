    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am an international student applying to the University and will transfer there by next year. I checked the budget calculator on Acadia\u2019s website to see the cost of the residential dorms. Quick question, which dorm type is usually the least expensive and if it is paid for a school year I.e. 6000 CAD will it also cover the break between years? Or will we pay separately for those?",

            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nThe budget calculator gives a general idea, but there's a full breakdown of the options on the [Residence Fees](https://www2.acadiau.ca/student-life/residence-campus-life/residences-housing/fees.html) page. Double rooms are the most affordable.\n\nThe residence plans cover the Fall and Winter semesters (roughly September-April), so if you planned to stay in Wolfville year round (ex. through the summer), you would need to pay extra for those months.",

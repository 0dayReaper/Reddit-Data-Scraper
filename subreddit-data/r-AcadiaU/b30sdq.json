Join Professor Victor Muniz-Fraticelli, author of the book \u2018The Structure of Pluralism\u2019, for a talk on the pluralist view of freedom of religion as a political tradition that makes distinctive and radical claims regarding the sources of political authority and the relationship between associations and the state.\u00a0\n\nProfessor Victor Muniz-Fraticelli is Associate Professor of Law and Political Science at McGill University. He received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 2008, and his JD from the University of Puerto Rico in 1999.\u00a0\n\n**This event is co sponsored by The Pre-Law Society and the Acadia Students Union and will be taking place at the K.C. Irving Environmental Science Centre Auditorium, 32 University Ave, Acadia University 6 p.m March 21.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Click here](http://www.liberalstudies.ca/event-registration/) to register for this event.\n\n[Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1023553751170252/) to check out the Facebook event for this talk.

    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m a new student starting in September coming from Ontario. I absolutely love reading and ranting about certain books I\u2019m reading. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have many friends who want their ear talked off about books they haven\u2019t read so I\u2019m hoping to meet people who share my same interests in the form of a club. Not sure if there are any (hence why I\u2019m posting haha), I was hoping someone would know if there is a book club or not. If not, no worries. I\u2019ll find someone around campus to annoy \ud83d\ude02",

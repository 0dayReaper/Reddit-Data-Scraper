I don\u2019t think you need to demonstrate financial need (there are entrance scholar-bursaries that do take that into account though). When you apply to your program, they\u2019ll send you a letter of offer and indicate whether you\u2019re eligible for an entrance scholarship and information on how to apply (applications due march 1st)\n\nYou can get all the information here: https://www2.acadiau.ca/financial-aid/future-students/entrance-scholarships.html\n\nOffers for scholarships are usually made sometime between march - june but I\u2019m not sure of the exact date",

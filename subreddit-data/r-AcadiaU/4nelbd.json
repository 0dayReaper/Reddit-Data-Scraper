    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI\u2019m looking to fill a position (or two) in the lab, and hoping to reach interested students. \n\nCurrently, we have two major projects that we investigate in my laboratory:\n\nThe first involves investigating mechanisms linking changes in fat metabolism in the kidney to risk of diabetes. In short, we are trying to understand how diabetes develops, and why the risk is so much higher in overweight people. The project would provide an opportunity to use techniques in biochemistry, molecular biology, histology, and physiology. There is also a potential to work on collaborative studies on human samples, to translate the relevance of this work to clinical outcomes (trying to identify people most likely to see their metabolic syndrome progress, or develop kidney complications). This work is supported by the Canadian Diabetes Association.\n\nThe second project involves investigating the function of novel enzymes in lipid metabolism. This is basic discovery work, and we are working on a few enzymes right now. There is an protein that is well studied in cancer, but no one knows what it \"does\" yet. In addition to characterizing the enzyme, there would be an opportunity to study functional implications in cancer, and potentially in neurons as well. Because of the need to set-up a new assay system, this work is also best suited for a PhD candidate with prior related experience, or a post-doc. This work is supported by NSERC.\n\nMy lab is fairly relaxed, and the current group are really nice, supportive people. As a supervisor, I try to provide as much material support as needed. For some people, this means daily conversations, for others, it\u2019s probably weekly or less. I don\u2019t typically push people, I just try to be there when people want support (in as big or small a way as needed). I also try to make sure trainees are working on something that is well defined, and can definitely be published, and will definitely lead to timely graduation/completion. \n\nPlease visit our website for more general information about the lab https://uwaterloo.ca/lipid-enzyme-discovery-lab/\n\nIf you are interested and qualified, please contact me at robin.duncan@uwaterloo.ca with your CV and a brief (but specific) statement of interest. I will do my best to respond to everyone who replies, but I\u2019ll only follow up in depth with people who seem like the best potential candidates for these positions. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this message. \n\nCheers, \n\nRobin\n",

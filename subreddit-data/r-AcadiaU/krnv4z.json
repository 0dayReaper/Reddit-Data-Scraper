    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm an incoming student for Fall 2021 (third year, dietetics major). I have been searching up apartments or rooms to rent near campus without much luck. There is very little available and what is available seems ridiculously overpriced, especially for single occupancy. I'm wondering if I should expect to see an increase in options come May when students go home for the summer, or will it more or less be the same. Even a bedroom in a house with another person feels overpriced (I would only want one or two roommates). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've looked into residence and I am using it as my last option. I'm hoping to get into RoJo if I go that route. What should I expect, being an upper level, mature (34 years old) student? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone know of any places that list apartments or rooms to rent? I've been checking Facebook/Kijiji.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any insight, y'all.",

I would've never taken the place just for myself as even with our both incomes, it can get pricey. Sadly, it seems that's how Acadia and the town make their money. You gotta remember, you're coming into a small town and its economy revolves heavily around the University and its students.\n\nYou'll honestly have to sit down and make the math on the potential cost of living in a residence or not. For us, it's still worth getting a different place as we both don't party hard and we tend to be more chill than others. Our own space matters to us so living alone is a must. we also don't have any student loans so we're paying everything out of our own wages and savings; those expenses include, rent, wifi, food, gas, etc etc. Due to our combined income, all of that it's still less than the 8000+$ the school charges you for a residence. \n\nI assume you'd want a furnished place and there's not that many of those, hence the high prices. You could also find a place or two in other towns near the school but for that, you need a car so you gotta think about that.\n\nOn another note, it appears the overpriced rent is a thing in Nova Scotia. Coming from Quebec, specifically Montreal, I would've never paid this much for this small apartment. Maybe Downtown Montreal, but in a small town? not even up north around Montreal in the towns surrounding the city across Quebec you these prices.",

It might be easier to find a place if I am actually in the area. I won't give up on looking for a place before then. Maybe I will get lucky.",

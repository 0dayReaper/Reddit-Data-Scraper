I\u2019d reach out via Instagram since that seems to be their most active platform.\n\n@AVUltimate (Annapolis valley ultimate, Instagram Handel) seems really active and is running a league in the area as well. I think a guy named Nate runs this league and is very nice and approachable. \n\nTry reaching out to those two accounts and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help you out :)",

I don't want a crazy party house, but I also want to be able to meet people.\n\nI'm also oddly anxious about washroom (ik I'm weird), and there is really no info about acadias washrooms ANYWHERE. A premium room is way out of my budget, so does anyone know what res has good washrooms??",

            "comment": "I lived in Chris last year, and am staying in Chase this year. I really like both, but for different reasons. Chris was very quiet. I got lucky and met some great people there. Most of my friends were in Cutten, and for me personally, I'm glad I wasn't there (chaotic). Chase is mostly 2nd and 3rd year, but with that, I find that the people are generally more respectful and mature. I have met a decent # of first-years at Chase too. Chase is much more social than Chris, but not a party res. Eaton is basically the same as Chris, but tends to attract slightly more social people. If I was doing my first year again, I probably would choose Eaton-- but I'd expect it would be similar to my experience with Chris. Bathrooms are kind of hit or miss unfortunately but generally kept decent-- you can always find the nicest one in your building and frequent that one. Chase definitely has a less person-to-bathroom ratio because of the setup. If you are interested in a girls-only res, Whitman (Tully) probably has the cleanest bathrooms overall. But, make sure you think through whether slightly nicer bathrooms are worth it for a (maybe) less desirable residence.",

Washrooms in all 3 of those residences are shared, single person washroooms with a toilet, sink, mirror and shower (or shower/bathtub). Basically, you\u2019ll share with your floor mates and bring your toiletries to and from your room.",

            "comment": "Generally the 'party' residences are Cutten and Dennis. Theyre pretty much only first-years, so if youre looking to meet people those might be a good place, but it is a bit of a toss up because you might end up with a bunch of partiers or you might not.\n\n If you're worried about bathrooms, I would try to get into a residence that is organised into sections instead of halls, so Cutten or Chase Court. They're bigger residences, but they have more bathrooms per person and since your hallway will be pretty small it can be easier to get to know people. Chase is mostly second and third years, or first years who aren't coming straight out of high school, so it's a bit more chill since people will go out instead of drinking in their rooms. It's also only single rooms, meaning the rooms are a lot smaller and you could end up in a shoe box, compared to Cutten which has bigger singles and doubles too. Chase is also the closest to Meal hall and not as far up the hill as cutten, plus they just upgraded the basement (chasement) so it's got bunch of new chairs and tables to study at. \n\nChris and Eaton are great if you want to meet chill, genuine, people, but they are halls, so that's like 4-8 bathrooms on a floor, so you're sharing with a lot more people.  Those are a mix of doubles and singles. Dennis is the same set up. \n\nI lived in Cutten during first year and I ended up only sharing a bathroom with like 3 people since I didn't have a roomie and my neighbours were also singles. But i also ended up paying like 700$ in damages because people were batshit.",

The bathrooms look like they aren\u2019t cleaned at all and the insulation of the windows is so old and broken that  the temperature inside the room gets dangerously low. It\u2019s like 7*C/ 45*F in my room as I\u2019m typing this and they refused to give me a heater because my heat is working even though it\u2019s not sufficient to maintain even half of the temperature they are legally required to maintain in a residential building.",

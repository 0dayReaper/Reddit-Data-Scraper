Less people so you\u2019ll get to know everyone a lot more. \n\nEaton is going to be a lot louder, more of a party with a lot more people. If you\u2019re a social butterfly, you may really thrive there. You\u2019ll meet a lot of people. If you want your quiet time though, it might be a lot more difficult to get it. \n\nEither one is great. You can always meet friends and go to the party at Eaton but it\u2019s always nice to know when you need the quiet, the party isn\u2019t going to be 2 doors down either.",

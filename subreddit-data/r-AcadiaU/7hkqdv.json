    "postText": "**Tl;dr: If you don't want to be forced to buy a bus pass and subsidize the expansion of Kings Transit, vote NO on the referendum in 2018.**\n\nI usually don't follow student politics or post rants on the internet, however this proposal is such a ridiculous cash grab that it would almost be funny if it wasn't going to cost me even more money.\n\nFor those who are unaware, Kings Transit has sent a proposal to the Acadia Student's Union requesting them to hold a referendum during the 2018 general election on whether or not to force students to purchase a \"U-Pass\" that would allow them to ride the bus as much as they wanted. \n\n[Here is a link to that proposal.](http://theasu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kings-Transit-U-Pass-Proposal.pdf)\n\nNow I will list my reasons why I think this idea is a ridiculous cash grab and will be voting NO on this referendum and encourage all of you to do the same.\n\n* While such programs can be useful in large cities, Wolfville is a small town and nearly everything a student could need is available in town within walking distance.\n\n* They say that you would have to ride the bus twice a month just to break even with this service. I personally do not know anyone who rides the bus that often. Many people who own a car, carpool with friends, walk/bike or use online carpooling groups would be forced to pay for a service they use rarely or even not at all!\n\n* This proposal was not asked for or drafted by the students, it is solely Kings Transit lobbying the student union to force the students to pay into this service. In fact, this referendum was tried in 2013 and the students decided they do not want this \"U-pass\". It is quite obvious that they do not have the student's interests in mind and instead have an ulterior motive. I mean, what company wouldn't love to be able to force a large group of people to pay for their services?\n\n* It seems like they want to expand their service, and they want to force the student body to subsidize it. They should finance this through other means instead of exploiting the student body to increase their revenues.\n\n* They love to use fluffy words such as \"equity\", but the fact is that any increase in fees will negatively impact the less economically advantaged students the most.\n\n* Acadia University is already one of the most expensive universities in the maritimes, and this would make it even more expensive. In addition, students are already burdened with $415 worth of student union fees a year and this would only increase that amount.\n\n* This sets a precedent for any other company/service that wants to force students to pay for their service. They'll know that all they have to do is lobby the students union and use pandering rhetoric about \"equity\" and the environment and they'll have a new revenue stream!\n\nSorry for the long rant, but such a transparent cash grab has made me angry and I am passionate about saving money and stopping the addition of new mandatory and unnecessary fees.",

The convenience of getting up the hill with my groceries, for example, would have been worth it. The convenience of getting to New Minas or Kentville or where ever else would have been worth it.\n\nEdit:\nNow that I've read the proposal the deal sounds even better. The monthly cost is about a tenth of the normal price of a student bus pass.It can be used in the summer months too, that is huge. This would make coop jobs in New Minas or Kentville more accessible for students without vehicles because they wouldn't have to find a place to live within walking distance of their place workplace. Many students find themselves with a lease that extends through the summer and, while they may be able to afford to move home to their parents' place for a job, they might not be able to pay rent for two separate places at once.",

            "comment": "Currently, a **monthly** bus pass for students is $65. Though you are correct that the majority of students do not require public transit, there are some that do. $80 per year is a much more affordable option for them that is not possible unless it is a mandatory student fee. Personally, I do not mind paying $80 per year if it means it will help someone else out who is paying several hundred dollars per year to afford to get to school, even if I do not use the bus myself.",

I'm not always against these proposals, for urban areas and commuter colleges where most people take the bus or would if it was more affordable, it can have great results and most students are happy with the greatly decreased bus fares.\n\nHowever, Acadia is not a commuter college. Most students either live on residence or off campus within walking distance of the university and downtown. Most people who choose to commute do so due to lower rents in other towns or because they can live rent free with a family member, which would offset the costs of transportation.\n\nIt seems as though only a few select groups (and Kings Transit, who proposed this scheme) will benefit from this. The majority of the students will be forced to pay for a service they will rarely use to subsidize it for the small amount of people that do. As a struggling student myself, I don't expect the rest of the student body to pay for my living expenses/transport, why should they expect that from me?",

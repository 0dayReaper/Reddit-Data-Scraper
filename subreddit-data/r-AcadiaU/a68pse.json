I honestly don't care what anyone's political beliefs are, but I was in his class last year, and he would constantly shoehorn politics into class. Sometimes entire lessons would be spent watching YouTube videos that had absolutely nothing to do with the course. THAT is when it becomes a problem.",

What I\u2019ve heard is that he used to be a great prof, but then he went a bit off his rocker. \n\nHe began using class time for political rants that weren\u2019t at all relevant. I also heard he filmed a student talking about a sexual assault they suffered without receiving permission (they raised their hand and talked about it in class), and posted it on his public twitter (I don\u2019t have official confirmation of this, but I\u2019ve heard it from two people who were in the class). \n\nHe wasn\u2019t a good prof anymore, and he crossed some lines. As someone else has said, though we obviously have free speech in Canada (with some legal limits), the fact is you don\u2019t have a legal right to continue being a prof regardless of what you say or do. You may have known him before he started doing this stuff (I\u2019ve heard he used to be really cool!), but unfortunately things changed. ",

The biggest teaching Rick wanted us to take with us at that time (even more important than the course material being covered) was the ability to think critically and form our own opinions. I learned a lot in every class I took with him and I must say he's a tremendously intellectual man. Rick's teachings helped me develop my mind as an intellectual and actually helped steer me down my research career path. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe silver lining to this situation (it's almost funny to me) is that his teachings on critical thinking and independent thought are what helped me realize just how unjust his firing was. (this is where the audience will start to turn on me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've all seen the sensationalized headlines surrounding Rick's case, and initially I was persuaded by them. However, I remembered the man I had met, and these actions were far outside of his character. The wording of these news articles relating to his case, as well as the wording used in his letter of termination by the university, were both defamatory and inflated. I do not think this was an accident. I believe these accusations and stories were sensationalized to sway public opinion. I believe that Rick's beliefs did not align with those of the university and they wanted to do everything they could to force him out (and by swaying public opinion through the use of sensationalized media stories they did just that). I've looked into all of the accusations made by the university and looked at the information pertaining to them. In contrast to public opinion, through my research I have come to the conclusion that his termination was, in fact, unjustified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to debate this with anyone who disagrees with me. Let's keep this civil, folks. :)",

After first year a lot of students either transfer away to larger schools or drop out.\n\nHow truthful is this?",

The ones that do can't handle the work, or they can't handle being out on their own. This happens at every school. \n\nThe small school atmosphere means that you end up with more direct access to professors, which can provide better results in your education. Having said that, your mileage may vary depending on the program that you want to study in and how you approach school in general. \n\nDisclaimer: I work at Acadia. PM me if you have more questions.

Acadia has a great community, and I have yet to meet a professor that is unapproachable or unwilling to help. \n\nAlso, since the classes are relatively small, it isn't hard to find students who are willing to help. Especially in the business department (Current 4th year student here), there is a great deal of idea sharing even amongst groups. \n\nCommenting further on /u/dbenoit\n\nSmall universities are great. And in regards to the tuition money thing...At the end of the day there is a limit to the amount of students per class. \n\nFrom what I know, most of the students who leave/drop out, is because they aren't ready or they prefer to make money than further their studies. \n\n\n-----Also if you ever have to take and elective (assuming you are not in Comp Sci) -- COMP 1812: Computer Concepts &amp; Apps is a great course.

Sure it's small, but it's a beautiful town, with a great vibe. Check Wolfville out on a Saturday during the spring/summer.  ",

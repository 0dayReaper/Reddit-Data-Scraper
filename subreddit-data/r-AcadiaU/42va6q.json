    "postText": "Hey all\n\nI graduated from Acadia's business school 15 years ago. Since then I've founded and sold a couple tech startups. \n\nI'm in town the next two days speaking at several business classes. Thursday night I'm buying beers at the axe and open to chat with any student about anything I can be helpful with.  \n\nCome by and look for the old dude requesting a lot of Great Big Sea songs. \n\nCheers\n\n",

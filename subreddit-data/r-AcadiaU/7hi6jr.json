Do you want a quiet place for studying, or do you want a place where there's always something going on?  I don't know if there are still single-gender residences, but if that's important to you it'll factor heavily into your choices (of course).",

Eaton is a froshy residence this year, with a good sense of Acadia pride and some well established traditions. \n\nAs far as the best residence, that really depends on your desire for community and what sort of community you prefer: quiet and good for academics, froshy and exciting, or a healthy mix?

    "postText": "Ill be attending Acadia in a few months, and I was wondering which On-campus residences I should consider. I checked Acadia's website and chipman house and Dennis house looked decent. I want a dorm which is always alive and active, one that has lots of social events going on.\nAnd,which of the buildings has the best lounging area? \nLastly, would you guys recommend single rooms or shared double rooms? \nYour answers are much appreciated:)) ",

            "comment": "Pretty much any dorm will have things going on! I live in Chase and there are events happening regularly such as residence intramurals and stuff. There are usually people watching movies or hanging out in the lounges on weekend nights\n\n If you want a party house, maybe look at Chipman, Dennis, or Cutten. The downsides of living in a party res are A) if you want to sleep and there's a party going on you're SOL, and B) if any damage occurs you might have to split the cost (someone punched some holes in drywall and now the whole residence has to split the cleanup and repair fee) \n\nHowever, if you are in a party res you are in the center of the action, and people will be glad they have a friend to get them into the parties!\n\nI haven't been to many other residences but I would say the lounges are probably all comparable.(TV lounge, Pool Table, ETC)\n\nIn terms of a double or a single, I would recommend single. They cost a little more but at the end of the day, you have your own place to do whatever you want it. You don't have a roommate to worry about. Consider the fact that you will be sleeping right next to, and sharing the same space with a complete stranger! Although your mileage may vary. You could also consider a suite, which has a shared common area and 3ish people who share the area.\nPM me if you have any questions and I will do my best to answer them! Acadia is a great school :)",

            "comment": "I graduated over a year ago from Acadia and had a lot of fun there. I lived in Chipman for 2 years and there are a lot of pros and cons to living there.\nPros: \n-super welcoming atmosphere\n-Friendly people\n-Very inclusive and accepting during frosh week and through the year\n-The alumni ( so people who don't live there anymore) are also pretty involved in parties, outings, etc.\n-Always a party going on whether it's in the residence or outside at a house party\n-You have the opportunity to make life long friends\n-Great lounge areas and there is a decent amount going on during the week that isn't party and alcohol related\nCons: \n-Often really loud, So if you don't go out that night it can be hard to sleep and definitely some FOMO\n-Even though it is really inclusive within the res, a lot of outside residences considered it pretty culty in that Chipman only hangs out with chipman so it may take away from you meeting some great people who don't live there\n-Harder to focus on studies and extra curricular with all the emphasis on parties\n\nI enjoyed living there but I can't say a whole lot about any other residence because I only lived in chipman! If you do live there I would recommend being very open to friendships outside of the residence though so through your program,etc.,  because I feel like I missed out on some amazing people due to this and got caught up in popularity!\n\nHope that helps :) also sorry if this is hard to read, I'm on Reddit mobile",

People usually try to co-ordinate with their friend group so they can all move in together in the same pod. This means that it can be really hard to make new friends because everyone already has their social group and routines set in stone, so to speak.\n\n\nBecause it is grouped in pods instead of the typical long res hallways it can be a different dynamic than the other residences. You can get really close to the people in your pod but are mostly isolated from everyone else. So if your group of 8 sucks you're pretty much screwed.",

It was a quieter res my first year, and then people from the more active residences moved in and realized they all lived together, so it was a pretty active residence that year",

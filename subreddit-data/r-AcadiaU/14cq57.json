    "postText": "I'm heading off to Ontario for Christmas, and I'd like to deliver a Growler to a friend there. Any clever ideas on how I could get it there? I doubt I'll have room in my suitcase, and even if I did, the airline might not be a fan of it. It might or might not make it intact if I sent it as a parcel via Canada Post, but even if I did, I'm worried it would spoil by the time it made it to its destination.",

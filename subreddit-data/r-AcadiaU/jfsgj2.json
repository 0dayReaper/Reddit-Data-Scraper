I mean shit , if your class is online, well then no need to go all the way over there right?\n\nthe article is done by CBC and you know who gon read that? the locals.\n\nI few days back there was someone posting about bad experiences with locals on Wolfville. I don't know if y'all remember but we're on a pandemic bruh and community distrust between small towns and outsiders is at an all time high across Canada. \n\njust chill out for a bit, when all this done fuck yea we'll all go out with a bang n shit but right now we just gotta chill. go play xbox, study more or up your online game, y'all don't need liquor n parties to get girls.",

I love my parents but I know I\u2019m a lot happier here than I\u2019d be at home right now. I would much rather spend my last year near my friends (in small gatherings under 10 people, which is perfectly allowed in the bubble). Not to mention, it\u2019s much safer here than it is where I\u2019m from. There are also some small classes that are still being held in person on campus with masks, classroom sanitation, etc. Hopefully this helps explain.",

While I'm lucky enough to have my current living conditions I understand that others such as yourself might not be as lucky.\n\nI still think it's important to understand our civic duty and acknowledge the current times. it's not the time to shoot the shit and act like nothing is happening. whether one's unhappy or not, there's still a responsibility we must uphold and people all over the world have understood and have changed their social patterns and habits for the sake of the culmination of this pandemic.\n\nBut then again, I understand that's easy for me to say when I live with my partner and dogs and we chilling.\n\nUltimately I think it all boils down to this;\n\nI don't know about ya'll n shit but I personally rather have articles talking about dumb nazi-trump supporters being incapable of following simple quarantine regulations than educated University students in our country. Let's think about that.",

I snitched on some neighbors for having a party that was way over capacity.\n\nArticles like this break my heart because it makes the students look terrible. I think it\u2019s important to remember that\u2019s just a foolish minority, and many others are actively encouraging better behavior. Even so, I\u2019m glad these articles are being published so anyone who thinks of having/going to a huge party knows they could easily get a huge fine.",

Because the virus is sentient and can tell if you are doing \"good\" things like sports instead of \"bad\" things like partying of course! Or if they were down in the South Shore holding massive rallies and burning stuff down they wouldn't get a slap on the wrist let alone a fine! But students are the \"easy target\" so let's crack down on them and act as though they are plague carriers even though the arrival of the students caused 0 outbreaks, defying the prophecies of all the local \"public health experts\" on Facebook.\n\n\nI wonder how many of the locals had \"socially-distanced\" (yeah, right) barbecues over the summer that broke the guidelines? We will never know because as long as you are middle aged and middle class you get a pass.\n\n\nNot defending the students, they broke the law and have to take their lumps, but I find people love to blame others and use them as a scapegoat while having a massive blind spot for their own behaviour.",

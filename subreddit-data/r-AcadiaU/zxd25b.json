There are only two bars but there are whole party streets. Dorms also have great social scenes too. Had a pool party in Denis in February, next door neighbours took apart their beds and got an inflatable lol. It isn't about where you are but who you're with and Axe folk are amazing.\n\nAlso, solid education, which likely should factor in somewhere :S",

I swam at the three pools waterfalls. I wore togas, costumes, and coconuts at themed parties. I went sledding on food trays down Uni hill *although I dont think they have trays at meal hall anymore and we 'may' have 'stolen' them.\n\nBig city people often struggle because it's more about making the fun than finding it.\n\nGood luck! Uni is amazing for so many reasons",

            "comment": "there is definitely partying. Especially as you get into upper years and get to know people, you could find something fun / someone hosting something pretty much wednesday- sunday. Generally people will go out to the vil thursdays, stay home / house parties / the Axe (student bar) on fridays, and either go to house parties / the vil on saturdays. Wednesdays are great for pub nights, so trivia and open mic nights. If you're underage it can be a bit dry during first year, but if you make friends in different residences you should be able to find things to do.",

If you have any interest in representing your school in CS:GO, LoL, or Overwatch then please contact me at general.ciea@gmail.com\n\nEven if you don't have a team and want to play just shoot me a message and I can help connect you with like minded people at your school. Also I am open to running other games if there is interest!",

On looking on the website, the facilities etc look fantastic, just basically posting to see how current/past student find/found Acadia. So just any thoughts on whether it would be a good school to come to for a semester. If it helps anyone who is commenting I'm a maths major, and i play a lot of soccer for both my university and when I'm home for summer a team there (standard of both is quite good) ",

            "comment": "I'm a current student here, it's a great school, one of the best undergraduate universities in Canada. The school population is quite small (~4000) so there's a real tight knit sense of community. Your profs will be able to call you by name after only a few weeks because most classes are fairly small. I'm a varsity swimmer here too, we have one of the strongest athletics programs on the east coast. I'm sure the soccer team would appreciate your services!",

There is a varsity soccer team and lots of intramural teams.. The only concern I would have for you is the location. It is in the valley and about 50 minutes away from Halifax. So if you are thinking about traveling around a lot while you are here it might not be the best school for you! (The bus into the city is about 40$ round trip)",

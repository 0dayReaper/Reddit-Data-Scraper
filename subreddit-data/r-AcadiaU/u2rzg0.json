    "postText": "Good morning!\n\nI'm a future COGS student looking into the Applied Geomatics program. My plan is to study remote sensing (eventually) and saw that the program can lead into the Applied Geomatics program.\n\n I'm an Army vet with no college/university experience. I'm wondering what people's experiences are with the program. From a employment perspective: is it worth doing versus Graduate Certificate given at COGS?\n\n I really want to get into remote sensing, data collection and processing. Would this program add anything to what I learn at COGS?",

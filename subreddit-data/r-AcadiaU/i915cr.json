I'm an engineer and while I didnt do Eng at Acadia, I did do it within the maritimes.\n\nI may be incorrect but I believe you'll only do part of your degree at Acadia before having to finish at unb or dal. \n\nAlso, high-school marks aren't a good indicator of marks in engineering. Lots of people, myself included, got 90s throughout high-school only to struggle in university. The coursework will be hard, that's a definite. Marks will depend more upon how hard you're willing to work and how much time you're willing to commit.",

Although, you are only guaranteed to get into the discipline of your choice if you obtain a certain GPA. Would highly suggest going to AU or X for your first couple years if your looking to have a bit of fun before you get to Dal.",

You essentially apply at the end of second year or 3rd year if you stay for 3 years and the dal accepts you to the discipline of engineering you got into. \n\nI personally did a 180 from electrical to computer science once I got to dal but most of my friends are trucking along fine",

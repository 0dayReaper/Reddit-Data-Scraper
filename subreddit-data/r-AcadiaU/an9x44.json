            "comment": "Earlier in the game #23 (Rodney Southam) was shaming a sexual assault survivor to a STFX player (see CBC or global article) that player told his coach and his coach told the on ice official and the Coach of Acadia. Nothing was done. A little bit later the STFX player was lining up for a face off and the Coach of Acadia sent out Rodney Southam to line up against him. The STFX player wasn\u2019t happy with this and decided to take things into his own hands (first fight) and his team choose to stand up for him versus letting a player get away with absolutely disgusting comments that have no place in today\u2019s world. This all probably would of been avoided if the on ice officials or the coaches of Acadia took #23 out of the game after the original incident. It\u2019s obvious the coaches of Acadia care more about a hockey game than supporting victims/survivors of sexual assault.\n\nGo to the AUS video archives and rewatch leading up to the brawl and you\u2019ll see all the events I mentioned happened.",

Lots of people new even before this game that those disgusting comments were made from a certain Acadia player before. One of their assistants even let it slip that they warned Rodney to never bring it up again. The AUS hockey community is fairly small so it\u2019s easy to find out the facts. For those defending Rodney you should really look in the mirror, what would you do if someone made comments to you about someone close to you? He is scum, he deserves worst than he got, and I\u2019m sure more facts about how big of a POS he is will come out soon. ",

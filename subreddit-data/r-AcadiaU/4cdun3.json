            "comment": "I started off with Sociology and then transferred to SMU for Criminology and I'm about to become a join a Canadian police force. People that I have known that have taken Sociology have ended up doing a lot of different things. Some completed Masters degrees at Acadia and are now research assistants at Dalhousie and other universities. It depends on where you want to push it. I won't lie, people will not be chomping at the bit to hire a Sociology major when you graduate. My advice would be be to get as high grades as you possibly can to ensure that you'll be able to do grad school or additional programs in the future, even if you don't think you'll go. You'll want to be able to take advantage of every opportunity. The Sociology department at Acadia is excellent. Some names that sound out in terms of professors are Sacouman, Thomson, James Brittain, and the lovely Zelda Abramson.",

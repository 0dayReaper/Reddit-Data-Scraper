Eaton and cutten are also great but less party oriented, although cutten does have lots of parties but its huge so you dont get bothered by it if you aint partyin.",

            "comment": "Heres a definitely unbiased breakdown of each residence;\n\nBarrax (War Memorial): Too far from everything on Campus, long walk to Meal Hall, super nice residents though.\n\nChase:  Kinda quiet 2nd year res (that sometimes hosts first year parties? lol)\n\nChipman: Best first year res on campus. Family environment, fun times. University cracks down hard on us for damages/policy violations though. People think we\u2019re a cult hahaha.\n\nEaton/Christopher: Chipman\u2019s rivals, nice enough people. Don\u2019t live here unless you\u2019re okay with getting ripped apart by Chipman residence (all in good fun of course).\n\nRoy Jodrey: Quiet upper year res (so quiet that we didn\u2019t even think anybody actually lived there)\n\nDennis: Crazy party residence. Enjoy high school cliques/drama? This is the spot for you. (Right in the middle of campus tho so good location)\n\nSeminary: Super quiet, historic building that actually has classes held in it as well. \n\nWhitman (Tully): All female residence in the middle of campus.\n\nTower: High rise building at the back of campus, long walk to classes but not too far from meals/parking. \n\nCutten: Perfect mix between social life and school work. Also towards the back of campus but you get the best of both worlds when it comes to partying/quiet time.\n\nHope this helps a little bit!",

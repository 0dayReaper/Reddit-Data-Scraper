I know a \"quiet\" residence won't really be an option but I'd like to stay away from the party-er residences. Does anybody have any recommendations? \n\nAlso does anybody have any experience with the roommate matching for shared rooms?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Also, the room doors in Tower use actual keys instead of key cards, so you have no risk of locking yourself out. \n\nTower is a little far away from classrooms, but you get used to it. The view is also really nice if you are in one of the higher floors (which the quiet ones tend to be).",

Tower was my home and I had a very positive experience living there. Barrax is too far from meal hall in the winter. Christofor and Eaton are nice but basically the same residence. You're gunna make friends no matter what but Cutten, Chase and Dennis are probably the most rowdy from my experience here and I haven't heard anything good about tully either.",

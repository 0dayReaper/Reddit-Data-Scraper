    "postText": "So I'm a student at another university for business/accounting and I'm looking to transfer to Acadia. One of the reasons this place stands out is the amount of credits I'd be able to transfer over, but I want to know about the school (education, social, community etc.) So are there many clubs? Are the people social (not 100% focused on school all the time)? And for those of you in business, how are the classes taught(I mostly just don't want it to feel like highschool again, which was a big disappointment where I am now)?\n\ntldr; Opinions on Acadia's [business] education style, social life, and possibility for community involvement.",

            "comment": "I'm not a business student, but I can tell you that Acadia's social aspect is great. The size of the university is perfect. Where you don't get lost in the shuffle, but you can still feel part of a big thing. Most weekends, you can find parties or a place to study. There are a huge amount of diverse clubs that cater from political to athletic to artistic personalities. Being so close to what is considered downtown Wolfville  can also gives you a good chance to escape from the campus if you want. As far as classes are concerned, I'm finding my teachers to be knowledgeable about what they are teaching and give off a more professional feel than high school teachers.",

I've studied at two other universities since then and Acadia is by far the most inclusive in terms of always having things to do and being surrounded by friendly people.\n\nI did not study business but some of my roommates did and they were pretty happy with the program.

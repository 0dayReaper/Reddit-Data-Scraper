It is my understanding that they process room requests sort of \"first come, first served\" so it would be worthwhile to get your name in now. (Note: there are a lot of students who have accepted so far, but there are also a number of outstanding offers, and they haven't started with the rooms yet.)",

In my second year I was in a single room and then opted for that option. There's some residences, Chase and Rojo that only offer single rooms, that may be the reason why there's no option to choose. Or, potentially like a previous comment had said due to COVID there is no need to specify.",

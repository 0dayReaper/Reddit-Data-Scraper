    "postText": "Hi, friends! I\u2019m planning to transfer to Emerson in 2022. However, I\u2019m immunocompromised and have had to take my classes at my current college remotely throughout the pandemic. I plan to continue to do so until COVID isn\u2019t a pressing matter, but I can\u2019t find anything that explains what Emerson is offering right now. \n\nAre there still online classes? If not, do  they offer any remote learning accommodations for those who aren\u2019t able to attend? \n\nThanks!",

Some professors have been nice and let me attend remotely if I need to because of chronic pain/fatigue, some don't understand how to do that for me. If it makes you feel any better though they've been good about Covid regulations and there hasn't been very many positive cases here, to my knowledge.",

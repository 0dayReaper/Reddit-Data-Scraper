    "postText": "My daughter is considering going to Emerson in the fall. She likes the programs but has some concerns about opportunities surrounding her interests, and Boston. She\u2019s a prospective film major but is worried that there won\u2019t be many opportunities to pursue film acting. She took a tour of the campus and although it seemed like there was a good theatre program, she is hoping to find opportunities that will help her with acting in movies or tv rather than on stage. She\u2019s also concerned about life in Boston. When she went to visit she said that Boston was a \u201cdead\u201d city. I tried to assure her that she doesn\u2019t know the ins and outs of Boston yet, but she is worried that social scene may be lacking? Any advice I could give her from current students?",

While I can understand her desire to go straght to a movie or tv, that's a long shot at best, even if she was in a better location.",

As for Boston being a \"dead\" city - I can't say I experienced the same. There's a lot of opportunities for things happening here that, while she might not be thinking of, would be advantageous to her career. I helped with production on a bunch of different projects while I was at Emerson.",

    "postText": "Hey Emerson students, I would like to ask for some help!\n\nI'm graduating from BU at the end of May and have to leave my place on May 22nd. However, my new place has a lease starting on June 1st. Therefore, I'm looking for any short-term stays available during this period (10 nights from May 22nd to May 31st). Hotels/Airbnb are really expensive (min $200+ per night), so I'd truly appreciate it if anyone would be willing to rent out their place at a more affordable price.\n\nConsidering that it's such a short stay, I'd of course be willing to pay a large premium to make it a win-win situation.\n\nPlease let me know!\n\nThanks",

This will (ideally) help with that by providing student reviews on a class-by-class basis, rather than just through teacher reviews like RateMyProfessor. Top-level comments are reserved for different gen ed categories; please reply to them with reviews of any class you took that fulfilled that requirement.\n\nSuggested topics to cover:\n\n* How effective was the teacher?\n* How much work was expected?\n* How accommodating was the teacher?\n* Did you like the class?\n* Was it useful for your major?\n\nWhile you're absolutely allowed to give a class/teacher a bad review, please avoid personally targeting the teacher. Just use your judgment.\n\nSuggested format for reviews:\n\n    Class Title and/or Code:\n    \n    Teacher:\n    \n    Comments:\n\n    Would Recommend?:",

If you enjoy Marxist theory, Louis Althusser, and philosophy in general this class is great.  Dan is one of the best professors I've had.  I took this class in freshman year, 4.5 years ago now, and I'm still in contact with him.  He's extremely helpful with whatever you ask him for and he's just an all around knowledgeable and great guy.  DO IT.",

He doesn't check homework, and the tests are super-easy.

On top of that, it's all freshmen who take the course and thereby have no power over which teacher they get. It's really a crapshoot. Class quality here is really determined by how optimistic your classmates and your teacher are. I had a pretty cool experience because my teacher was awesome. She was super chill and admitted that we probably already understood the vast majority of the course material. My advice is to just have fun with it and do the best you can to not lose your mind.",

Really cares about subject material,  a good teacher, yet she understands that no one cares about this class so she is a little more lenient on the more stringent rules. I really hope she is still teaching here. I know she was applying for a full-time position last semester (she asked for my classmates and I who had her fall of last year to write her rec letters) but I don't know if she got it. You don't have too much of a choice when getting Speech Comm classes, but if you do, **try for Pierce-Saulnier.** ",

In terms of the material, I got little to nothing out of the class, but that may be because I have a natural bias against all things public speaking. She's a nice lady and she seemed to know the content fairly well, and as prince noted, she seemed to recognize the general lack of interest in class, so we played a game every few classes and took field trips to the Max(lol).  So if you can't get the prof. that prince mentioned, Thompson is as good a pick as any. ",

Hofbauer is the chillest guy ever (he's a jazz guitarist and I'm relatively sure he's waked and baked class before) but teaches incredibly well and seems to know more about jazz then I know about everything. There was a take home midterm, a couple in class test/quiz things, and a paper where you had to go to a jazz concert and review it. Nothing in this class was incredibly difficult (if you procrastinate the midterm it will destroy you; just give yourself a day or two to do it. it's not hard it just takes a little while). He gave us extensions on a few of the assignments. He had office hours but I can't really imagine needing to go to them unless you just wanted to talk jazz. Just pay attention/take notes in lecture and study those notes the day before the tests, you should do fine. Didn't open the textbook once. He was very thorough. \n\nRelevant to major: nope but it was still interesting\n\nWould recommend: yeah, as long as you don't absolutely hate jazz",

Not perplexing information, but there's so MUCH of it that it's almost impossible to memorize.

Unfortunately, she (Putnam) tries to incorporate a lot of discussion into the class, which doesn't always work well. There are readings due every class. They're interesting, but not really necessary to participating in class. Weekly response papers (250-500 words) and two papers over the course of the entire year. No midterm, no final.

She does assign readings before every class, but you don't have to really read them to participate in class (like you said). \nShe decided to switch it up this year by adding a new assignment which requires you to take a photo in relation to what you learned in the class during the week, and write a 150-250 word response to it. You can do that instead of the 250-500 word response to the class/readings. It's a great way for photographers of all levels actually. She doesn't have a midterm or final, but there are 2 papers: Paper 1 is worth 20% and Paper 2 is 40% of your grade. \n\n\nAlso, 2 field trips to the MFA! \n\n\n\nWould recommend?: Definitely.  ",

My first impression of him and his class was that he was a funny guy, but he came off as a very intimidating professor. His workload was a lot, but his class was somewhat entertaining considering how he taught. His Power Points were text heavy and it was hard to grasp everything since he told us at the very beginning of the semester that he doesn't want us to copy his slides word for word. Around midterms, he told us that whatever grade we got on our midterm is a good insight to what our final class was like. It was rather scary when he told us this, but if you actually work your ass off in the class, you will do well. \nHe does assign a lot of reading, and he has online quizzes that are due every week (I think, I can't remember). There are only 10 questions every time and there's probably like 8-10 throughout the semester. He also told us to read \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" and that we will also have online quizzes for those too, but I think he forgot to set those up for my class.\n\n\nWould recommend?: Only if you really REALLY care about the environment. Other than that, no. Not the best class to get rid of Ethics Perspective.\n\n(Also, it sucks how this class doesn't get rid of Science Perspective. It only fulfills the Ethics.)",

It covered completely new material for me, and I learned so much about queer history and queer portrayal in media. I also formed a lot of close relationships, both with classmates and with Sunil, who is extremely sweet and understanding and one of my favorite people ever. At the beginning there's a lot of reading, but the amount of work you have to do tapers off throughout the semester. Don't buy all the books on the booklist at once, because Sunil will change the schedule around a lot.\n\nUseful for major?: I want to say yes, but... not really. It covers literature and film, but doesn't address technique, just perspective. \n\nWould Recommend?: Absofuckinglutely. However, you need to be open-minded and comfortable talking about sexuality. There is SO MUCH PENIS.",

It's probably my second favorite class I've taken at Emerson. Montillo is excellent at maintaining professionalism in the classroom while at the same time making dick jokes. It's a fun, interesting class. Be aware, though, there is a ton of reading, and not all of it is erotica. There is some pretty heavy shit, and we read some pretty old books. There are a couple papers to write, and there is an in-class midterm and final, as well as a final presentation, but they are all very freeform and as long as you present on something that pertains even tangentially to the class, she'll let you do it. We watch a bunch of movies and talk a lot about sex in pop culture and its relationship to love.\n\nWould Recommend?: If you're a WLP kid who wants to look more at the sexy side of lit, take it. You won't regret it.",

He speaks with very precise British accent, which he ever so infrequently slips out of, in favor of an American accent. His class is all about Greco-Roman literature (texts like *Odyssey* or *Poetics*), the Bible (which I guess counts too) and the Divine Comedy. Dulgarian is one of those guys who is so much smarter than you, that it is just impossible for him to talk in terms you'd understand. His essay prompts are ridiculous, long and pretentious, but he's an extremely easy grader. So, try to make sense of his lectures, do the reading, and take solace in the fact that he isn't as pretentious as you think\u2013he's from Detroit.",

The subject matter is fascinating, McLaughlin-Volpe is a great teacher, very knowledgeable and into the subject; she's also a very pleasant, understanding person. I have not had to go to office hours yet but I would guess she would be incredibly helpful one-on-one if need be. You don't need any prior psychological knowledge to understand the class. There are 3 or 4 multiple choice tests and 2 4-page papers. The work load is relatively mild yet I still feel like I'm learning a lot. The biggest drawback (which really isn't that big in the first place) is McLaughlin-Volpe's German accent, which I understand pretty well but I do realize that some people have trouble understanding certain accents. It's not too thick or harsh but it is obvious. \n\nUseful for my major?: not really but it would be useful for a lot of majors.\n\nWould Recommend: Absolutely.",

    "postText": "Hi all. I was wondering if any of you have information regarding the Emerson film production program. How are the internships, equipment, and networking activities. I'm also wondering if you feel that their program helps prepares you and set you up in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso how is the student life scene? IS the campus LGBTQ friendly? And is partying a huge part of student life?",

Internships are everywhere, equipment is top grade, and you absolutely meet a ton of great connections. As far as student life, it is absolutely LBGTQ friendly and there isn\u2019t really much of a party scene based on location. To be honest, especially with covid, it\u2019s really tough to meet people and make friends if you aren\u2019t going out of your way to do so again because of it\u2019s city location. Overall tho I love it here and there isn\u2019t a better place to do what I want to be doing",

Let's break everything down here.\n\nThe Internships are handled through a site called Handshake, which is like LinkedIn but exclusively for college students. I know a few people, but I honestly haven't had much luck securing anything to my fancy.\n\nEquipment is pretty good! The official campus distributor can be a pain, but there are student organizations that are way easier to get gear from. I'd say it's just about what you'd expect it to be.\n\nNetworking is THE calling card for Emerson, and The Mafia is no joke. We have a better alumni program than schools five times our size, which rules.\n\nThe academic side is great, don't get me wrong, but, like all things, you best learn by doing. And if that's your way of going about it, you can throw a rock and hit a dozen productions looking for contributors. \n\nCampus is VERY LGBTQ+ friendly, so much so that it kinda overshadows the other oppressed groups on campus. Take that as you will. Lastly, nah. Emersonians are just now having to figure out their own parties since we can't crash other campuses anymore, haha!",

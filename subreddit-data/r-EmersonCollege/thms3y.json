I was wondering if anyone knows if they teach greek at Emerson? For a while i've known I would love to study the language in college but it was hard for me to find info on their website. Thanks!",

They have a few more choices.   Look at the part that says Pro Arts Consortium and the very bottom of the list is the Emerson classes. \n\nhttps://www.emerson.edu/departments/education-abroad-domestic-programs/foreign-languages",

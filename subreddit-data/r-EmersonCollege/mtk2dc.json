    "postText": "Hi!  My daughter has been accepted into the Communication &amp; Sciences Disorders Program. Emerson is her 1st choice.  She will also have the opportunity to play for the softball team. I\u2019m looking for any insight from current/prior students regarding the program.  Trying to decide if the price to attend is worth it.  She has a much better offer from Ithaca, but her heart is w Emerson.  Thanks in advance for your insight.",

Although a bit pricey, the student/teacher ration, the 1 on 1 direction and attention, the small incoming and ongoing class size are all bonuses. We definitely made the right choice with choosing Emerson.  Please feel free to message me if you have more specific questions.",

    "postText": "With registration of next semesters classes coming up I thought that another recommendation thread would be helpful. I remember using  [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/EmersonCollege/comments/11mqqm/a_guide_to_gen_ed_classes/) last year to find Gen eds, and I took one I really liked.  I think for this thread we should open it up to all major classes because some of those are hit and miss as well. \n\nHere is the text from the other post for the lazy and general guidelines:\n&gt;Please upvote this for visibility; it's a self-post so I get no karma. Also, thank you to /u/hi_mynameis__ [1] for getting this discussion started.\nChoosing gen ed classes at Emerson can be a total crapshoot. This will (ideally) help with that by providing student reviews on a class-by-class basis, rather than just through teacher reviews like RateMyProfessor. Top-level comments are reserved for different gen ed categories; please reply to them with reviews of any class you took that fulfilled that requirement.\nSuggested topics to cover:\nHow effective was the teacher?\nHow much work was expected?\nHow accommodating was the teacher?\nDid you like the class?\nWas it useful for your major?\nWhile you're absolutely allowed to give a class/teacher a bad review, please avoid personally targeting the teacher. Just use your judgment.\nSuggested format for reviews:\n\nClass Title and/or Code:\n\nTeacher:\n\nComments:\n\nWould Recommend?:",

I panicked in the beginning of the semester and flaked out on my first story, but he was totally understanding and gave me a second chance. You can tell he's a big deal in the industry because he's been on The Colbert Report *twice*, but he's super humble about it. On top of being a hilarious, completely down-to-earth dude, he's a great professor who gives you fantastic feedback on your stories and sets an amiable, accepting tone every class. I don't I've ever heard him say something mean or heavy-handed about a story that's been submitted, and it's not that there haven't been some bad ones. Some might see this as coddling and if you want a professor who will really give you the straight and true about your writing, he might not be the guy for you. But I've had a great time in his class, it's definitely the highlight of my week. He's taking a leave of absence for spring semester, but I highly recommend taking a class with him if you ever get the chance.\n\nEdit: I know my flair says I'm a journo major, but don't trust it.",

He's very specific, but it shouldn't be hard to figure it out after the first test. I got so good at knowing what he wanted that when I took Civil Rights (after having him for three other classes) he excused me from the last test. I got to miss the last two weeks of that class, which gave me extra time to prepare for my other finals.",

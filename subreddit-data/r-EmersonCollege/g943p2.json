    "postText": "Applied to Emerson as a priority transfer applicant on 3/26, but had some issues getting my current college to send my official transcript with the outbreak. Admissions said they could review my application with a screenshot of my transcript, which I sent with the application - they eventually received the official transcript in early April. \n\nI called admissions on 4/16 - they said many decisions were already released, and I'd get a decision \"as soon as possible\".\n\n11 days later, I'm not sure what \"as soon as possible\" means. Anybody else still waiting?",

They said they would be releasing those in May. My girlfriend also applied around that time. Her transcripts have been held up by her old high school of things because of the pandemic. She has been calling them worried because she also doesn't have a decision yet. I would not worry they said they are still building their transfer class. I may have recieved fact admission because the community college I'm transferring from has an articulation agreement so we automatically get in if you have a 3.2",

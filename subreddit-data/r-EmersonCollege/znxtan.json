    "postText": "Hi everyone, does anyone know if my acceptance letter did not have any info about getting any scholarships, does this mean that I did not get any? Or is there still a chance that I could have some scholarships/grants when my financial aid offer comes in January? I was accepted EA, and I saw that a lot of other accepted students already found out that they got some scholarships so now I\u2019m worried that I didn\u2019t get any kind of merit based aid. Thank you in advance!",

Scholarships are more for specific programs people applied to, like the honors program or scholarships outside of Emerson.",

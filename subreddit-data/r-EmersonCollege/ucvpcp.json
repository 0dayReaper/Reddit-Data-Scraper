    "postText": "I have been watching more old movies to expand my horizons and fell in love with Taxi Driver. I really relate to the main character, he\u2019s so cool.\n\nAnyway, the RAs are doing the rounds tomorrow and I worry having 3 Travis Bickle posters will sound the alarm. I\u2019m not an incel or anything but I worry the RAs will think I am. I understand Travis is a bad guy, but I do relate to how cool he is.\n\nAnyways, lmk if I should get rid of the posters before tomorrow.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! So I'm starting at Emerson in the fall and I was wondering if anyone has any info/tips/advice/experiences about how Emerson handles learning disability accommodations? I read through their policies and everything, but they're not very specific and seem to have a very broad approach? \n\nDoes anyone have any examples of what accommodations they have and also what the process of getting them was like? \n\nThanks in advance!",

You can get in touch with the College\u2019s Student Accessibility Services department and they\u2019ll hire another student enrolled in your lecture classes to take notes for you, if you need it. I think other accommodations include extended deadlines, more time taking tests, etc., but I can really only speak for certain on the notetaking front. Hope this helps!",

They're very broad and will work with you to work out what you're looking for. You can contact them at https://www.emerson.edu/departments/student-accessibility-services/accommodations-process",

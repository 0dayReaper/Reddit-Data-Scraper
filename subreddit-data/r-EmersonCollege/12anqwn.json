    "postText": "What the hell is going on?\n\nI, like most people, assumed the nominations would come out March 30, because that\u2019s when they were announced last year on Good Morning Emerson. This date was basically confirmed when, last week, the Evvy\u2019s page encouraged student to watch GME on that day.\n\nWell let me tell you, I watched Good Morning Emerson on March 30th\u2026 and it was awful. I don\u2019t want to talk down to anyone who works on it but the audio levels were all over the place, segments played multiple times without explanation, and the intro to the show (which played 4 times through the episode) was like 2 minutes long for no reason. Still, I suffered through the whole thing, and at the 50 minute mark: the moment I was waiting for.\n\n\u201cAnd now for a special look at this years Evvys\u2026 promo.\u201d\n\nA promo. \n\nI was pissed. I channeled my inner Lydia T\u00e1r and went berserk. I called out of my classes, I cried, I pissed, I even got a wellness check by the police. I was truly inconsolable.\n\nBut then-hope.\n\nThe Evvy Instagram page posted the true date for the nominations: April 3. \n\nI was ready. I knew I was basically guaranteed the nomination after last years snub so I made arrangements for my imminent fame and fortune. Last night I even broke up with my girlfriend because I wanted to be a bachelor for the awards. This was after, mind you, I ended all my friendships so I could befriend other nominees (people of the same auteur breed). \n\nSo tell me why, after all my sacrifices, without warning, they only announced HALF the nominees with the other half (the half people actually care about) being announced next week.\n\nIs this what we\u2019ve come to? Are we a communist country now (I don\u2019t know what communism is but that\u2019s what it feels like).\n\nAnyway, I demand a formal apology.",

You\u2019re not going to be able to handle the real world if this is how you approach a school\u2019s award show. I promise you, out here in the real world, once you graduate school, no one is going to give a fuck about the EVVYs. Most people haven\u2019t even heard of them. The EVVYs don\u2019t owe you shit. All that matters is that you are proud of your work. You need help for your mental health and that is all you need right now. Not validation from student awards.",

Last year they snubbed me even though I worked really hard on my short film. \n\nMy mental health would be fine if they just gave me the recognition I deserve.",

No one owes you anything. The school doesn\u2019t owe you anything. You\u2019re not going to find people willing to work with you to make an Oscar worthy movie until you stop acting like this. Get over yourself.",

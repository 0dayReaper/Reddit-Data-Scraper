    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am working on my Honors Thesis at Boston University and am looking for college-aged females in the Greater Boston Area to participate in my research study! :) Students from any university in the greater Boston area are welcome to participate!\n\nI am looking at the relationships between women's health habits, self-perception, physiological data, and cognitive performance. Participating in the study will not take up too much of your time!\n\nThere will be a pre-visit survey to fill out then we will ask you to schedule an in-person appointment within 1-4 days after completing the survey. When you come in for your appointment, we will have you complete a short questionnaire, followed by completing cognitive tasks and having physical measurements taken, then you will complete another short questionnaire, and the appointment will conclude with you being debriefed on the whole purpose and details of the study!\n\nYou will receive a $10 Starbucks gift card for completing the study!\n\nIf you are interested in participating, please complete the survey linked below!!\n\n[https://bostonu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bmfGlZmR4aU3TQq](https://bostonu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bmfGlZmR4aU3TQq) \n\nIf you have any questions regarding this study or would like more information, please contact me at [jcstaub@bu.edu](mailto:jcstaub@bu.edu).

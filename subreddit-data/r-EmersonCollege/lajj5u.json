Staying at home during COVID has put all of us in an endless and unnatural loop of constantly being online and on edge.\n\nThat is why we have handpicked a set of random yet exciting experiences in Boston that you can enjoy and meet people along the way. \n\nThis week, we have experiences like Axe throwing, museum visit, rock climbing, combat archery, and pottery painting. We have tried our best to up our creativity to discover local experiences where people can stay COVID safe but also have fun, hang out with friends, and meet new people. \n\nTake a look here if this is for you.

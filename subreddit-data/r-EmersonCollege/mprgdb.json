    "postText": "I just got accepted into Emerson\u2019s film grad program and I want to know if it\u2019s worthwhile? I know the tuition is about $30k a year and it\u2019s three years long. I got a scholarship of $25k for the three years, so basically one year is free to me but I would be coming out of grad school with $65k debt I\u2019m guessing. I also come from nyc so I would have to get an apartment and I\u2019m not that well off. Do I have a better shot in just trying to find a job and not going to grad school. Is it even worth it? I\u2019m so conflicted and need some help and insight. Thanks!",

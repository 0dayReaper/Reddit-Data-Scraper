I believe my most urgent questions are if it\u2019s worth it, how the curriculum will benefit me in the fullest way possible (e.g. more reading intensive, discussion based, etc.), what kind of skills would best prepare me for such, and is the major more specialized rather than broad. Thank you so much! And for reference, I wish to be an author/poet someday (and possibly a lawyer, but it\u2019s more of an afterthought).",

Lots of reading, lots of discussion, lots of critiquing. Will it help you? I believe it will and has helped me. Best skill I can recommend for this is time management. It's easy to let the assignments get away from you. Will you be attending on campus or remotely? (I did mine remotely). \n\nFor reference, while I was there, I wrote three novels. Of them all three have been published. My thesis, in fact, just came out this past December.",

I\u2019m a fan of the BFA because it\u2019s not an English degree with writing bolted on, it\u2019s writing. There are general requirements but still it\u2019s tons of writing. And Emerson is a plus because many schools with creative writing degrees are exclusively short stories in the literary genre. At Emerson you write what you want. She\u2019s taking tons of other writing classes, too: magazine writing, poetry, screen play. The network is amazing and the professors are actual working authors.",

    "postText": "I just got into Emerson for media arts prod, and it\u2019s currently my best choice but I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t like it for a few reasons\n1. I\u2019m from NYC, when I visited Emerson and other Boston schools I got the feeling that the city wouldn\u2019t be enough for me coming from NYC. I don\u2019t mean to sound pretentious and I know Boston is great compared to other cities but I\u2019m just worried I won\u2019t be able to go out and I\u2019ll be stuck on campus. I also heard from my friends (who go to Harvard and BU, so not sure how relevant this is to me) that the bars/clubs in that area are really cracking down on underage college students so it\u2019s really difficult to get in and it\u2019s hard to get into parties at other schools.\n2. Im pretty sure Emerson is only 2 buildings (I could be wrong) so does it ever feel too small? When I toured it felt like a performing arts high school and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t get the \u201ccollege experience\u201d.\n3. From what I heard it\u2019s really \u201ctheatre kid\u201d school and while I mean no disrespect to those studying theatre, I find that I don\u2019t really click with that demographic and I\u2019m worried I will dislike the people there",

            "comment": "Emerson is probably the best college, location-wise, in Boston. It is quite literally in the heart of the city next to all the touristy stuff. It\u2019s also all right next to each other, not spread out across multiple blocks for no reason. It\u2019s also definitely not 2 buildings lol. It\u2019s like 5, but they are all next to each other except for Paramount, but even that is just a 5 minute walk (if even). You probably won\u2019t be able to get into a bar in the area, but where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way, can probably get someone who is 21 or with a convincing enough fake to buy some. \n\nI\u2019ll also say Emerson has some of the nicest dorms I\u2019ve seen in college. They have AC and some good amenities and the WiFi is pretty good. \n\nThe school is kind of cliquey, not necessarily theater-kid but there are a lot of groups to fall into. Despite its reputation there are a lot of personalities there.",

            "comment": "(Based on my experience visiting)\nI don\u2019t think Emerson is a great choice if you want the \u201ccollege experience\u201d. It is only going to be worth the 80k a year if you are very serious about wanting to get into the industry. \n1. Area doesn\u2019t have great clubbing (It\u2019s Boston) but there\u2019s still plenty to do with the sheer amount of schools in the area. I have heard that frats/sororities are a better way to get invited to stuff in that scene. \n2. Campus is extremely small. If you are claustrophobic/ have a fear of heights I would really not recommend. There is also no college-only green space, just Boston Common, which can be annoying for some people. You definitely won\u2019t be stuck on campus as there is a lot nearby, but the campus itself is tiny. \n3. Based on my visit with accepted students only attending, there was a clear divide between two groups, performing arts people and everyone else. That being said, the non-performing arts people definitely outnumbered them. It seems as though they blend together into various social groups outside of their majors except for the \u201cfilm bros\u201d.",

It\u2019s got an ice skating rink in the winter, historical statues, tennis courts, biking/running space, pop up cafes, and a nearby subway station. You can google pics of it to better understand, but it\u2019s not affiliated with the campus, it\u2019s just the only \u201cgreen space\u201d nearby. It is best to go with a group if you are female, as men will approach you (no guaranteed security bc it\u2019s a public park)",

            "comment": "Aight heres my 2 cents,\n\n1. If you want clubbing you're gonna need a really good fake. But there are plenty of parties and events you can attend from emerson folks or by making friends from other schools (mit and bu frats etc). Nightlife is certainly different but its not nonexistent if you know where to look. (I prefer the music scene to the party scene but they operate in similar groups, )\n\n2. Emerson is more than 2 buildings haha but it is only about 2 blocks.\n\nwe got:\n\nLittle building - dorms and classes\n\nWalker - classes &amp; library \n\nthe Dh &amp; Lions Den - dinning halls\n\nTufte - classes \n\nAnsin &amp; Union bank - classes \n\n172 - meeting rooms, kitchen, spiritual life \n\nPiano row - dorms, classes, and a dinning center\n\nParamount - classes, dorms, and a theater\n\nand 2b &amp; colonial - dorm buildings \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbecause the school is very much \"the city is our campus\" it doesn't feel small at all. It gives you the freedom to bop around and do whatever you want. It'll make you feel the exact opposite of being stuck on campus since this style forces you to leave and fuck around in the city. ESPECIALLY since emerson is in basically the heart of the city. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. yes, a  majority of the people who go there are \"theater kids\" and the other half are people still stuck in a high school mentality. But with all the good about emerson theres bound to be some bad. And thats when you go and make friends with folks from other schools haha. If you don't click with those types of people, than your \"at school\" social circle may be smaller than at a larger school, but because there are so many other students in the city you'll be totally fine. I have a few very close friends from emerson but I mostly spend my time with berklee kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmerson is a great school but it does have its problems. Ive loved my time here so far, although its been different than what i've expected.  If you do attend just be prepared to have a different college experience than in the movies.",

Yea I heard it\u2019s cliquey i honestly was surprised cuz I thought it seemed more inclusive. I actually just got into NYU tisch for film production \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d just an hour ago so now I\u2019m deciding between the two schools. Do you have any insight as to which is better? NYU gave me a $60,000 scholarship so I\u2019m not sure if Emerson would be worth it. I\u2019m sure there is some sort of rivalry between the two schools so I\u2019m wondering what the general opinion is",

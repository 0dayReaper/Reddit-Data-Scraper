(2017-2020) I got the job because i was eligible for work study and sent out a bunch of applications on the FWS portal. \n\nI assume you're looking for a job at the service desk. Spots are more likely to be open at the beginning of the school year than in between semesters because most people stay there during their whole time at Emerson. Feel free to ask the Access Services Librarian when there might be openings though! There are sometimes more positions than the service desk. Don't ask too often though, if you're asking every week it will likely hurt your chances more than help.\n\nBe warned it is an extremely competitive job- I was told that there were 300 applicants, 30 interviews, and 7ish hires. It helped that I worked at my middle school library which I mentioned in my cover letter.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nAlso, did you know that Shu Iwasaki is NOT an emerson alum? That's right! He was actually a Japanese environmentalist who- (idk if this joke still applies bc the tour guides may have changed their spiel lol)",

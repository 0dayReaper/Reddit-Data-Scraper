    "postText": "I got wait listed for Fall of 2020 for Media Arts Production, which sucks since I love Emerson (and kinda kicking myself for not applying early since I might have had a better chance of getting in). I've read the wait list letter a few times and I'm not sure if Emerson is looking for/expecting a letter of continued interest. I know a lot of colleges do, but I'm not sure about Emerson specifically and I haven't seen anything about it on this sub.\n\nAbout a month after I got wait listed, I won an award at a film festival which would be cool to note. On the other hand, my most recent semester grades aren't fantastic, so I feel like I wouldn't be taken off the wait list regardless. I would want to write a letter, but would this even increase my chances or just be bothersome to them? And even if I did get off the wait list I probably wouldn't be able to afford the school, so is it even worth the time? I'd love to attend Emerson and I think it would change my life so much, but I'm not sure if it's a realistic goal at this point.",

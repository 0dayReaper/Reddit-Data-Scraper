I came across the publishing and writing MA and was curious to see what students thought of it. I am also having a hard time finding information on application requirements for gpa. Any comment would be much appreciated!",

The WPF program teaches every aspect of publishing. It teaches book layout, editing, book design (different from layout), marketing, etc. The writing aspect of it includes workshops and literature courses. \n\nMy experience: I wrote two books while I was there (because I'm a chronic over-achiever). The first book won the Graduate Publishing award (which came with a $600 first prize) and was so close to being ready when I got done with the layout class, I went on and self-published it. It got a starred review from publisher's weekly, and has been my most successful book (fifteen in print) to date. \n\nThe second book was my thesis. The workshop classes really tore it apart and exposed some weaknesses I hadn't seen before, and really helped make it better. That book got picked up by Bloodshot Books and will be published soon. \n\nAll the teachers there were very kind and helpful, all the students (with few exceptions) were helpful. I think, if you go into it with a sense of humility and a desire to improve, you can get a lot out of the program. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions.",

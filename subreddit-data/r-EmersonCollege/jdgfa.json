Fuck.\n\nNote: this doesn't mean there's a huge contingent of Emerson students who identify strongly as atheist (I do), rather students who are disavowing of the Judeo-Christian \"God\". I've found a lot of students at Emerson who consider themselves to be \"spiritual\" which is something I think is silly, but hey, it's better than a contingent of fundamentalist Christians.",

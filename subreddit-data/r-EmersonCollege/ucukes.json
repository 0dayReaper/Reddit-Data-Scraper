    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI am amidst decision season and am between Emerson's Global BFA in Film Art program and DePaul's Television and Film program. Obviously Emerson's program is much more intriguing as I get to study at Emerson, Paris College of Art, and Kasteel Well. However, I was just wondering if anyone could give some insight on the program as far as filmmaking and production. I understand it isn't necessarily a production program but it seems they really advertise the fact that you will be making films. I more or less want to know if this program is truly worth it, or if their are any current students who could give me their thoughts on the program?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "The program is a little different then what it is marketed as. At Emerson, you get to learn about the history, production, and get hands-on experience with film. At paris college of art, the teachers are definitely not as experienced as the ones at Emerson. They have a very old Hollywood and traditional view of film, and in my experience don\u2019t provide the best feedback. This is coming from a first year in the program. In all honesty, this program is really going to be about you getting resources you need and sometimes self learning especially in Paris. If you want to be in a program where you will have instructors that are diligent and work with your style of film, paris college of art (in my experience) hasn\u2019t really provided me that. They also expect a lot of students to already know the basics of film and don\u2019t teach it.",

You only get media production during a semester and the first years got to direct their own documentaries and short films, and you get to work on each other\u2019s sets. Sometimes you\u2019ll even get to work on the sets of the upperclassmen. The most discouraging thing was the other part of the semester where the classes focused on photography and screenwriting, and class wise you didn\u2019t really get to work on sets.",

In all honesty I\u2019ve learned quite a lot and have been able to work on many student sets and even a few projects outside of school! It just seemed like the better option considering it\u2019s actually quite selective and extremely unique compared to other programs.",

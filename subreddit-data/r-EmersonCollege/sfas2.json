I have been checking out every website I can to find out more about the school and it got me thinking. What's the best thing you have found at Emerson that you weren't told about? I can't wait to go, and I'll be visiting this Friday!\n\n**Edit** Thanks everyone for your feedback! I'm stoked to go here in the fall and I had a great time during Picture Yourself at Emerson day. Everyone seems to be very friendly and I can tell it's going to be a great year, you know, supposing the earth isn't destroyed on December 21. That would be a bit of a buzz-kill.  ",

It is very good at marketing itself. \n\nMy favorite little secrets generally relate to food that you can get close to campus. Like 2 AM pizza at New York Pizza (near the Union Bank Building). Or 24 hour breakfast a little down the road at South Street Diner. Or super cheap asian food basically everywhere (we're right next to Chinatown), including a cheap and delicious sushi place behind a Metro PCS store. \n\nA great little bonus that is kept pretty quiet is that the Museum of Fine Arts is free for Emerson students. Good for cheap dates. \n\nAlso, as a film production major, you should know that you should avoid filming in the commons. Everyone films in the commons. If you need a park, go up to the Esplanade. Its only 10 minutes away and you get a great variation of locations. \n\nThe musings of an end-of-the-year Freshman. ",

They talk about how amazing the LA program is, but to be specific, take Marie Colabelli's class (production management) if you ever do the LA program. She is now my mentor, I guest speak in her class, and she called me up about a job opportunity that brought me back to LA after I was unhappy in NYC. She teaches the ins and outs of production, and EVERYONE needs to know this whether you're in front of the camera, above the line, below the line, etc.",

If you like music/performance, you're easily within walking range of the Orpheum, the Royale, the Wilbur, and TD Garden, while other major venues like the House of Blues, Paradise Rock Club, and the Middle East are only like a 10 minute T-ride away.\n\nReally, most of the benefits are related to the fact that Boston is a small and lively city that is *really* easy to get around. You can pretty much go anywhere and find something to do at any time. Seriously, it's awesome.\n\nAlso, if you're into basketball, one hilariously unexpected thing is that most, if not all, of the visiting NBA teams like to practice in the Emerson gym. One day you could be walking to your classes and suddenly find yourself face-to-face with all of the Miami Heat in the Piano Row lobby (which happened to a friend of mine recently).",

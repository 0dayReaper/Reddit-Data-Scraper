And to top it off doesn't seem to be making any connections because apparently people don't seem to like them.\n\nOP the entitlement is strong here.  Know that when you join the workforce you will rarely get any acknowledgement for just doing your job - that's just the way it works.  No one is going to sing your praises because you turned in that massive report on time even though it took you all weekend and many nights before to finish it.  And no one has to be your friend - it takes effort on your part so maybe find out what your roommates think is annoying about you and work on it\\\\make the effort.  Now is the time to work on those personality flaws.",

What matters are the results and the outcome.  Trust me - I'm in my 40s and this was a lesson learned a long time ago.  No one, once you get into the workforce, is going to give you a pat on the back just for trying but not having a successful outcome.  It's a tough reality but you have to hit goals with success to get any 'good job' comments.",

Chalk it up, try to figure out what you could have done differently, and then try again.  But don't expect to get any credit just for trying - and giving up just because you didn't get recognition or praise is BS (because if that's the attitude then you'll never get anywhere in life or accomplish anything).  The satisfaction should be personal that you did your best at the time and it just didn't work out - there's nothing wrong with that (As Yoda said \"The greatest teacher failure is\").\n\nEdit:  And it should be noted that recognition isn't deserved it's earned.  And sometimes not getting recognition is better - you get the personal satisfaction that you did a good job and accomplished what you wanted to accomplish.  But needing or feeling like you deserve recognition is something you need to work on - and maybe that's why you're having trouble making personal connections (my recommendation there still stands - ask your roommates what they find annoying and see what you can do about it).",

You said yourself that you don\u2019t think the film was good so do what it takes to make it better. Giving up should hardly ever be acceptable. If you intend to do something, (like college) then prove to yourself that you\u2019re capable of overcoming the obstacles that seem insurmountable. This is growth, but also so is quitting because you think you\u2019ll be able to rely on yourself and have faith in yourself.\n\nIf you quit/give up out of despair, you\u2019ll likely not be in a position for growth for awhile. \n\nGood luck in whatever you decide",

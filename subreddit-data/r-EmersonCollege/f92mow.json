    "postText": "I've made a couple of posts asking questions regarding the Visual Media Arts program, but I wanted to once again ask as I am gaining closer to the decision date. I was accepted into Emerson College's Visual Media Arts Program with no financial aid whatsoever and also did not get accepted into the Honors Program. I expected this as I'm financially comfortable and haven't really ever excelled academically. However, Emerson is still pricey (as I'm sure most of you know) and it has been a life long dream of mine to make movies, that's basically all I have ever wanted. I never knew exactly which aspect I wanted to go into the most (editing, writing, directing, etc.) but I love every aspect of filmmaking. So I wanted to know if Emerson College is a good \"Film School,\" I say with quotations as I know it isn't exactly a normal film school. \n\nFirstly, I have visited the school and fell in love with the campus and area. I am from Massachusettes so it is not too far from my hometown which is somewhat of a plus. However, I'm really looking for a school that will challenge me artistically, give me freedom to create the works I want and receive constructive and helpful criticism from teachers and peers alike, teach me about filmmaking history, and help me make connections after graduation as to ensure (of course) that I will be able to work and do the thing I love! \n\nAlso, as a side note, I am trash at math and hate it. I heard that as long as you have never gotten below a C+ in your High School math career you are not required to take math courses. Is this true?\n\nThank you for looking over my concerns, even if I don't get any responses I feel relieved jotting down my questions and concerns. I will be going to the Picture Yourself Day this weekend and hopefully then my general stresses will fade away.",

            "comment": "I went to Emerson and currently work in the animation field in LA. Emerson is a decent film school, it gives you the materials and ability to make a lot of film but it really is what you make out of the resources you have available to you. I know friends who've made amazing portfolio pieces while there and others who just watched netflix all day long and got by. If you put in the hard work you can reap the benefits. The biggest advantage of Emerson comes from the\"Emerson Mafia\" network you get afterwards that helps slot you into jobs from other alumni. This is how I've gotten most of the film jobs while in LA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said,  if you will go into debt going into Emerson... don't do it. You will drown in the loss of so much money it will be difficult to recover from the financial debt and student loans. These payments for student loans will most of the time force you to stop trying to get a film job so you can just get something to pay the bills. It's almost always better to go to a smaller or more affordable school with an ok film program or just go to LA and start in the industry as a PA to build up from there. Good Luck.",

Two different sets, and dedicated stage and theater, and professors who work in the industry are all there to help with whatever you wanted to do in film (writing, producing, etc.)",

You\u2019ll have to push yourself for sure. Just one thing to keep in mind, making movies and working in the movie industry aren\u2019t the same thing. You can do both, and Emerson can surely prepare you for that; but you\u2019ll have to take advantage yourself.",

You need to know people and 90% of people won\u2019t give you the time of day in any industry.\n\nCollege connections go a long way and have helped me get some good jobs and some great gigs. Even if you wanna be a gaffer in film you gotta get non-union work and there isn\u2019t exactly a craigslist for film crews (not for actual quality work anyways) so you kinda need to know people. Emerson gave me those first connections then I built on that",

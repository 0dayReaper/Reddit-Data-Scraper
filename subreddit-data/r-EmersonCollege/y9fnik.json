What has been your experience as a visual and media arts major, or better yet, if you are in the animation and motion media track? I really want to know if Emerson is the right fit for me.",

            "comment": "Hi im currently a VMA major (junior). I\u2019m don\u2019t have much motion graphic experience, so not sure if this particularly helps. Emerson definitely has its ups and down. We do offer a few animation courses that I have heard pretty good if not moderate review about. I would say based on my experience most of the organizations/clubs that are film production based don\u2019t do much animation projects (however there is 1 or 2 this semester on EIV- Emerson independent video). I would say the school is a great place to collaborate and find people work creatively with. And as most people know, Emerson connections are very worth it post graduating.\n\ngenerally, I don\u2019t find much presence of animation on campus, but a great part of that is because I personally am not involved in that department. But if you were interested in learning film in more than the motion graphics realm, Emerson could be a good potential choice.",

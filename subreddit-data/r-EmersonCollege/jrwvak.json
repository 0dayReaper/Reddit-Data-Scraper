            "comment": "Yea I was enrolled in the first year. I dropped out as the partner school sucks and I wanted some time off school. Don\u2019t fall for the advertisement I know it sounds incredible as I felt the same way. I heard from some of my friends that the program improved but I would never go back given the ridiculous price of tuition and board. I can go on and on about all the problems I had with it but I\u2019ll just give you some good warnings: The partner school is an ART SCHOOL they do not do film so they have never had a film program before, the fine art teachers were ok but the film teachers I had were definitely substandard especially compared to the ones we had at Emerson. Also they give you 0 guidance, you will get used to using the cafeteria at Emerson but once you get to Paris there\u2019s nothing like that, you\u2019re on your own in terms of living, and living in Paris is expensive. Let me know if you have any questions. I can definitely answer them",

            "comment": "The change from Emerson to Paris College of Art is drastic. At Emerson, you\u2019re provided with industry level equipment, places to shoot, high quality professors, and Emerson resources for mental and physical health. Emerson definitely aides you more on living in Boston with getting charlicards, providing food and dorm etc. At PCA, you get to live at estudines your first year, and it is definitely not a clean or safe place. Many students complained about how dirty the apartments were when they settled in. Sinks and showers started breaking and the person in charge of the building is not consistent with helping students with their needs of fixing something in their apartment or another issue. Additionally at PCA, the professors are not as good as the ones at Emerson. They all in all have a very traditional view of filmmaking  and disregard the ideas of new ventures into film and inclusivity within it. The equipment is not industry level even though there are even more film projects to do at PCA compared to the summer sessions at Emerson. You can also rent out for 48 hours and sometimes they do not have enough to rent out to students. PCA itself is very run down and a safety hazard, the bathrooms are never clean and there are parts of rooms with no ceiling. In Paris, PCA does not assist you as much as Emerson. You are on you own to get metro cards, mental/physical health resources, meal plans, and safety. It really depends on what you as an individual has coming in to the program about knowledge of film and their own resources for equipment. This program is more preferential for people who have those resources and knowledge because many of the PCA teachers do not teach you any technical skills of film, but focus on their reaction to your work. One benefit is that it\u2019s easy to travel and go to different parts of Europe to film.",

            "comment": "If you are going into this program hoping to make experimental, culturally-centered, or anything involving VFX. Please save yourself and go somewhere else. The program especially doesn\u2019t care about people of color (that\u2019s why many poc end up dropping it) the teachers are tone deaf and directly racist. They are stuck in old Hollywood styles and aren\u2019t open to a global view of film even though that\u2019s how the program is marketed as.",

    "postText": "Honestly such a weird question, but are many of the classes/studios at Emerson on high floors? \n\nI get super woozy being high up and it\u2019s actually become a major factor in whether or not I plan to attend. I\u2019m a transfer Media Production student who would be commuting so the dorms aren\u2019t a factor.",

I'm a freshman at the moment and the highest I've had to go up for a class is the 4th story of Paramount. I don't think you'll have a problem, but I don't know the extent of your condition. Hope this helps.",

Walker does have 10? floors, but in my time on campus I've only gone up to the 6th floor. My classes have been usually on the 2nd or 3rd floor at most buildings. Piano Row doesn't have many floors either. I've only been on the 2nd floor of that building though, don't think there's another.\n\nEdit: Tufte also has quite a couple of floors, I've taken a class on the 10th floor there. It has more, but I'm not sure how many. Maybe 14?",

I was afraid if I posted here I\u2019d get a ton of \u201cThen why are you going to a city school?\u201d \n\nTruthfully, I have zero desire to go to school in the city, but I also am not able to move and there aren\u2019t many reputable film schools in New England in general. Plus, I love the staff I\u2019ve met and the general vibe of Emerson, so if I can make it work I really want to. \n\nI have a disorder that causes dizziness/light-headedness and it causes a ton of anxiety. For some reason when I\u2019m on a higher floor, the feeling intensifies and I get those good ol\u2019 buckled knees hahaha. It\u2019s relieving to know the classes don\u2019t go as high as the buildings do :)",

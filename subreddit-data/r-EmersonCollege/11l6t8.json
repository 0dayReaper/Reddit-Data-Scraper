            "comment": "* Contemporary World History with William Mott - It was the worst class I've ever, ever taken. It was so incomprehensible. The lectures were rambling and nonsensical, and focused on obscure, abstract themes/topics with no practical application or root in the real world. The professor also wrote the textbook, and it was painful to read - typos, erratic formatting, fragments, no logical connections between concepts (sometimes even paragraphs), and, of course, a focus on shit that doesn't mean anything. I learned almost nothing from this class and it was an insultingly huge waste of money.\n\n* On the other hand, if you haven't already gotten Intro to College Writing out of the way, take it from Laura McCune-Poplin. It's a shitty class no matter what, but she does a good job of making it bearable and (occasionally) enjoyable.\n\n* SUNIL SWAROOP IS THE BEST GEN ED TEACHER YOU WILL EVER HAVE AND QUEER IDENTITIES IN SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY IS THE BEST CLASS YOU WILL EVER TAKE.\n\nEdit: I just set up [an official thread](http://redd.it/11mqqm) for this as well.",

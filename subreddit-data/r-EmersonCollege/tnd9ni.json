If you have visited the food hall OR you have some form of familiarity with the financial district, please help us out by completing this short survey. It actually would be a huge help and I would personally appreciate it: \n\n https://bostonu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_baqsbQEkbauI8Jw \n\nThank you!",

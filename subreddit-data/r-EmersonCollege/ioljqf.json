The gym is also small so the acoustics are pretty wild. A hundred people sounds like a lot more than that at times in there.\n\nI worked at ECS (great organization if you are interested in sports broadcasting) and we would be in the broadcasting room and the second I'd step outside I'd feel like I needed ear plugs.\n\nHere's one of my fave clips from our NEWMAC finals broadcast: [https://youtu.be/k2Wv8e4A4ug?t=3729](https://youtu.be/k2Wv8e4A4ug?t=3729)",

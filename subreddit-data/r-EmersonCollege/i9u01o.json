    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm moving out of my apartment and have said that I will help find new tenants. It's a spacious 4 bedroom/1 bathroom in East Boston, about a five minute walk from the Maverick Stop off the Blue line. Commute to Emerson and downtown is about 10-20 minutes. It's super close to the airport (one T stop away). It's pet friendly and has a covered deck and nice backyard! \n\nRent is $825 + utilities (usually 50-90 a month) and wifi. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7bphxae31h51.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7913b5503792b778da45c5a4f43a3ee23e3cfaa0",

I\u2019ve emailed the office of financial aid twice now, and have gotten the same answer that my file has been reviewed and I\u2019ll receive it shortly. I\u2019m getting stressed out because I have another school (Fairfield University) that I have to answer to by May 1st. Clearly emailing isn\u2019t working, so should I call them? I have no idea what to do.",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m graduating this year from Emerson and this is actually something I can answer! You can\u2019t choose for your first year, as a previous answer said, you can choose the number of roommates (which also decides how much room and board will be) and you can decide which community floors you\u2019d like to live on, but nothing specific. There\u2019s a ton to choose from if you\u2019re interested and will give you a more definitive answer on where you\u2019ll be if you get into one of them. If you aren\u2019t, that\u2019s totally fine, most freshmen are put into the Little Building, since it finally opened again this past year. Once you\u2019re in, from sophomore year until you\u2019re not on campus, you can choose your specific building and room and roommate. IIRC the time window you can choose is based on name, but I might be wrong. I\u2019ve been off-campus since junior year so I apologize if they\u2019ve changed something since I left the dorms. I hope this helps! And good luck on your upcoming years at Emerson! Congrats!",

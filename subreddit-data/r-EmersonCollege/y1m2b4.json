    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer VMA student, and have a project coming up that I have to film a short scene for. Only problem is that I know no actors, and I don\u2019t think my friends could pull it off/ would be legitimately interested. I thought I heard that there was an Emerson affiliated website where students could post gigs for actors, crew, etc- sort of like an Emerson version of Backstage. My Professor seemed to think the same but didn\u2019t know for sure. Am I just making this up or is it really a thing? Thanks!",

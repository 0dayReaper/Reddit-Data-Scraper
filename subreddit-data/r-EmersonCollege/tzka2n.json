IOS is getting better daily, but I never had issues with school or work software on a traditional PC setup. \n\nI personally use a Microsoft Surface Book. It will give you the software of a full on computer while keeping the portability of a tablet. My wife uses a Surface Pro for work which is the same thing as an IPad, just running full Windows. \n\nPricing out a Surface Pro, keyboard cover, and pen will put you in the same price range as an iPad with the same setup. OneNote is the absolute best software for note taking in class and work, and is thankfully comparable with both Windows/IOS.",

I've never met an Emersonian who didn't work hard at something, be it toking up, as evidenced by one of our first posts here, making movies, making tv, writing or journalize...ing.\n\nSo, friend me on Facebook if you know me, or even if you don't and let's put some good ole' elbow grease into this subreddit.\n\nCheers,\n\nJared Jacovich, Class of 2012, WLP Major, Redditor",

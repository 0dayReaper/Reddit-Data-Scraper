    "postText": "I\u2019m an accepted student at Emerson (+ honors program) and I\u2019m down to the final days to make my decision between here and my state school. When I researched the honors program, I saw students saying there was a lot of work and they were super stressed. However, I also hear people talk about how regular classes aren\u2019t challenging at all, which is concerning. I don\u2019t want to be stressed out of my mind in honors, but I would also like my courses to be thought-provoking enough that going is worth my $50,000. Can anyone share some insight on their experiences with this? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Not an honors student, but I will say that Emerson classes are very easy compared to the typical college curriculum at other schools. This lack of need to study forces you to fill up your time with extracurriculars and such. \n\nAs far as 'thought-provoking', it's what you make of it. The classes are usually discussion-based, but the assignments all follow a formula that feels like busy work. For many, Emerson is a place where they could express themselves and hold views that would have been not okay in their hometown. However, other students feel the class curriculum is too slanted towards one side, thus stifling conversation.\n\nYou're paying $50,000+ for the 'connections' you make here. Though that is disputed and can be hard to quantify. Still, many have had positive experiences with the Emerson Mafia.\n\nMy advice: if your family can pay for an Emerson education and your loan amounts will be low or zero, then go here. But if you're looking at loads of debt, the education is not worth it here.",

Boston\u2019s a pretty good college town and there\u2019s usually some group (sports team, frats, friends, etc) throwing a party on the weekends. A lot of people smoke cigarettes and weed, and usually people will be smoking cigarettes on the sidewalks on your way to class. If you want to smoke weed it\u2019s not too hard to find but as someone who personally doesn\u2019t want to do any drugs I didn\u2019t feel pressured to start. People are generally pretty respectful of whatever your preference is, and the overall vibe of the school is very tolerant\n\nEdited for grammer",

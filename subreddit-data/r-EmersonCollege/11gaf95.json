If you want to work hard in school, do a different major, but you will def learn how to do comedy / find your comedic voice. You just have to like be 100% sure this is what you want to do with your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso this major is very writing focused. So if that's a pro for you then awesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlove,\n\nFartAccountant",

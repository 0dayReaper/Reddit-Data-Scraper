One of the great things about college is discovering new interests so don't overthink it or stress if you end up in one that doesn't immediately sound interesting to you,",

Perspectives in World Music with Mina Cho is really great too (she's the sweetest human being on Earth). I also really enjoyed Literature of Extreme Situations, but I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't super into reading.\n\nI also have friends who really loved History of Jazz and Making Monsters too, though I haven't had them myself. \n\nAlso, side note not really related to your post: If you have the opportunity to take any VMA class with Peter Flynn, do it. He's the best film professor I've had at Emerson hands down (though none of them are bad in my experience).",

It\u2019s a deep philosophy class concentrating mostly on the Greek classics with a few Renaissance works and briefly dives into modern pornography.  I\u2019m glad I took it as the conversations were really interesting but it is a philosophy class.  Then again it could have changed as I took it in 2007.",

Especially if you have Chris Craig for the prof.\n\nListening to Music (MU137) is a bit mundane in course material, but if you ever have Prof. Fredericka King she is a gift. I believe she teaches most if not all MU classes. Lovely woman.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a 16F from CT (Highschool year of '22) and I've been in love with Emerson for a year now; it's my dream school. I have my eye on their BA in Business of Creative Enterprises but I was having some concerns that I was hoping a possible current student could answer.  \n1. Do they look at unweighted or weighted GPAs?  \n2. Do you know if there is more leniency for admissions given COVID-19?  \n3. Is there anything that can kind of be a knockout punch for getting in?  \nMy current stats are a 3.73 weighted gpa (representative of only freshman and sophomore year), no SAT/ACT score as of yet, and I'm co-president of GSA at my school as well as an upcoming club (as of this year) as well as apart of yearbook, murals, a district oriented social justice team, and apart of a lit mag at my school (all as of this school year with the exception of murals). I don't know if that information helps at all. I just adore this school and sincerely want to know all I can about the admissions process and my likelihood of getting in.",

The school\u2019s official position is that the pandemic is a Democratic Clinton hoax - and will not make any concessions towards academic pandemic performance - please don\u2019t mention the pandemic in any way in your application.\n\n3. You want to watch out for admission\u2019s left hook - they\u2019ll try to sucker you in with a weak right hand jab but be careful and keep your gloves up.",

Not sure what this means in relation to COVID but so many kids wound up not commiting to schools this year because of COVID so next year there will (possibly) be more applicants. \n\n3. I don't think that there's really a \"knock out punch\" to get in.  I had pretty terrible grades all throughout high school, but I had a portfolio that I was really proud of that showed off my skill sets really well. It sounds corny but just try to be authentic in your application. Emerson wants to see how you think, not a glitzy glamorized version of who you are. I also had some pretty solid extra-cirriculars throughout high school so you're on a good path with that!\n\nI don't know all of your details but just put as much of yourself into your application. I wound up writing my supplementary essay for Emerson about how I shit my pants at work, so really anything goes. Best of luck!!!",

I don\u2019t know how much you can list or the particulars of the extent you can list but I def have quite a few things that I\u2019m hoping Can help (doing local photography for an ig page and a few highschool businesses, making some music, etc).

            "comment": "Hey, I'm also a (recently former) BCE, so feel free to ask questions if there's anything I can do to help.\n\n1. It depends on what your school reports - mine didn't offer a weighted GPA, for example, but I imagine that'd be a question better served by asking your guidance counselor for what kind of reporting your school does - through Naviance, through direct letter, etc. I applied once through the \"traditional\" channels, and then re-applied with a specific application and a whole lot of paper copies of things, so YMMV.\n2. Emerson has mostly relaxed admissions in the last year, but there's a lot of enrollment limitations, given space limitations and serious financial strain (your financial aid from the school may be seriously competitive as a freshman). The reporting from this past year listed barely over 1000 new enrollments, but an almost ~40% admitted response to applications. That said... the school did receive several thousand fewer applications this past year, and even more of those that applied withdrew. \n3. Have some kind of story! Some kind of creative project you did, leadership in something, some entertaining happening you were a part of - Emerson's admission team is frequently enticed by good essays. If it's something that can get summed up in an interesting message that could get shared around the office on Slack in 10 words or less, write it.",

My school only shows us our weighted GPA in our transcripts and I know my school is a more difficult to school then others (I heard that colleges tend to look at that?) so I really hope I\u2019ll be okay in that department.\n\nI knew they offered early decision but I found out today they offer early action too so I\u2019m hoping doing that will raise my chances.  Thank you!\n\nThis is really good to know! Really paranoid about essay topic choosing and stuff but I\u2019m hoping I can pull through with something really good, and the advice is super great.\n\nSo appreciative, thank you.",

He first sent a long letter of continued interest to the director of admissions and his admissions officer, and then checked in via email with his AO basically once a week. Right before the decision he said if admitted he will commit. He didn\u2019t get into his ED school (NYU) and Emerson was next on the list so he wasn\u2019t lying. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I think you're confusing the image of college you see in movies with real life. Emerson is not a giant university with a traditional party scene, our student population is smaller than most.\n\nEmerson kids primarily party at a bunch of bars and clubs that are within a few blocks of campus. Greek life exists, technically, but the only greek house is nowhere near campus and generally regarded as a shithole. If you're a sporty binge drinker you might like it, if you're a girl you'll probably get SA'd. I'm kidding, but not really. (SAE, our most prominent frat and the one with the house, is commonly referred to as Sexual Assault Expected) Don't let that turn you away from Emerson though, because that's evidently true of all schools.\n\nYou're most likely going to find yourself hanging out with your close friends in someone's room, apartment, or a nearby bar (once you're old enough or have a really good fake). There are some nightclubs which will allow under 21's in, but don't expect the ones nearby Emerson to be full of college aged kids, you get a lot of other downtown residents.\n\nThere isn't anything stopping you from trying to party at BU, BC, Harvard, NE, whatever, but it'll be very hard without having connections. I think the closest you can get to what you're asking for would be to hit up bars closer to Northeastern.\n\nYou can DM or reply if you've got any other questions.",

            "comment": "Gets easier the older you get but it\u2019s a lot of cycling through parties at other schools you hear from friends/someone who knows someone, \u201cfundragers\u201d which are a film student\u2019s way of raising money for a student film by throwing a party and charging for alc/admission (anyone can get into these), dorm parties, the occasionally \u201csoccer house\u201d or ultimate frisbee team party. Comedy parties were pretty reliable. Really depends on what group of people happens to have a couple members who live together in a place that can host. Once you turn 21 or have a fake the tam (bar across from campus) becomes ol reliable and you go from there. \n\nLong story short partying will definitely happen but sometimes harder to seek out till you find a groove.",

BU and MIT parties are usually the ones you try to get into, but on a regular weekend, *maybe* you\u2019ll hang with Suffolk and Northeastern kids. it\u2019s a bit different in the colder months, but there\u2019s always life in the Commons\u2014 your go-to spot is the monument. fair warning, night life is much harder if you\u2019re not alcohol/420 friendly lol. btw the school has a \u201cyour body is not a container\u201d policy, so you can come into buildings totally trashed and they can\u2019t do anything: don\u2019t be stupid and get wasted inside",

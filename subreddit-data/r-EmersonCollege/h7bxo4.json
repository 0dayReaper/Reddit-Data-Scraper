    "postText": "Hi! I'm really interested in Emerson's journalism major but I'm curious as to how concentrated the program is on political and investigative journalism, as I'm mainly hoping to write for fashion/culture/beauty magazines in the future. Are you able to really curtail the program to fit your needs? Also, I noticed in the WLP major there were courses listed that pertained to magazine writing. Would the WLP major also be a good fit for my career goals? Thank you!!",

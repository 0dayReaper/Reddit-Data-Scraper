    "postText": "Hi, I just got waitlisted from Emerson.  Does anybody know typically how long it takes to find out if they accepted you off of the waitlist or not? My admission portal said that the reevaluations would be out by June 30th but may come out earlier based on when decisions were made.\n\nI'd love to go to Emerson, but if I don't hear back by I believe May, then I'll have to make a decision and make a deposit for a different school.\n\nI'm assuming that the waitlist decisions will come out a bit earlier than June 30th, seeing as Emerson released  decisions a month early, but I wanted to know if anyone here had any ideas about when I might get an email.\n\nThanks :)",

    "postText": "Graduate admit here. \nJust got my acceptance and they only gave me $8k in scholarship for a $46k program. \n\nI literally have a 4.0 gpa from my undergrad and graduated top of my class from a school ranked much higher than Emerson, and I'm near the top of my respected professional field. \n\nAm I just a jerk for thinking I would've been given more scholarship? Or are they just really stingy? \n\nI've appealed for more; but just curious what others think. \n\nThanks! :)",

            "comment": "From someone who frequently had to \"storm the financial aid office\": keep a close eye on that appeal, and if possible go in person to dispute it and ask for additional aid. I frequently wasn't able to get my \"final\" aid award until multiple meetings asking about what other programs I could qualify for, how much my aid could be increased, etc., etc. This was at least true for my undergrad years. \n\n\n\nIn addition - make sure they're not talking you in a circle over certain special options. My junior year they attempted to convince me that by living on campus I could get access to additional aid that would outpace aid I could get living at home and commuting. Turns out that was _very much_ not the case, and it took me doing the math out in front of them on a pad of paper.",

I had a _very_ different experience than normal, as I graduated into the pandemic. I was originally planning on doing event technology, but I ended up doing remote IT instead. Can confirm that it was an excellent program, but if I had the foresight of knowing a _global pandemic_ was going to kick off, I probably would have gone into a traditional CS program somewhere else.",

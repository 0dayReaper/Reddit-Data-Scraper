I\u2019d just like to be prepared so I can get my ideal room (preferably a single room because sometimes I get what I call social overload)",

Likely, since you're a freshman, you'll be put in Little Building which is the designated freshman dorm. If you really want a single, you'd need some health exemption (which it sounds like you can snag).",

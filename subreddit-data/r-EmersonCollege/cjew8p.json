I love it's artsy vibe and what the school has to offer but there is one thing that irks me which is the lack of diversity, primarily racial diversity, at the school. As a black female, I'm wondering what life at Emerson would look like for me, ya know? So if any person of color could share their experiences or anything that would be greatly appreciated!! :)",

From performance groups like Skin Tones (a capella) to community orgs like EBONI (Emerson Black Organization with Natural Intresta) I had a couple friends that were major parts of the different orgs and it's a really tight knit community!",

Diversity is a huge topic of discussion on campus (at least when I went there, graduated in 2018) and some of the leaders in these discussions are the cultural orgs. I\u2019d suggest looking into EBONI (Emerson\u2019s Black Organization with Natural Interest) and Flawless Brown (Women of Color). Both orgs are great and very well respected, but Flawless Brown is especially well known for the work they do around campus.",

What does Emerson do? Do they have connections with publishing firms? How are the writing classes?",

There's a lot of variety, so I guess I'm mainly speaking for the nonfiction classes I've been in. But I think in general, it's really helpful to be in the same classes as other skilled writers, because you sort of naturally also start to get better at writing.\n\nAlthough I will say that I'm not at all confident that I'll be getting a career in the WLP field after college. My writing major has certainly made me a better writer, which is an invaluable skill, but the program and its connections aren't strong enough to guarantee a WLP career for everyone. There are plenty of submission opportunities and the professors are well published and extremely helpful to know for networking -- that being said, the connections you make really depend on how much effort you put into being a member of the community.",

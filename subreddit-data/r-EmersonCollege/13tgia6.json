    "postText": "Any upperclassman film majors free to hop on a quick call to tell me about their experiences? If not all g\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n1. How easy was it to find professional film gigs/jobs at Emerson? \n2. Adding onto that, as a Canadian, how easy was it to find professional film jobs that sponsored work visas to stay in the U.S.? \n3. And last thing, I'm deciding between film school and foregoing school altogether to just work in film. In retrospect, what would you do? (luckily I have the money to go into school without worrying about debt)",

If you can go to school and not be in debt, do that. I\u2019m assuming youre coming from high school, but college is so valuable in so many ways for just becoming a fully realized person. Don\u2019t make the mistake of hopping into your career too soon. You\u2019ll get to it, be patient. Have fun make mistakes and memories while you can - that sounds cheesy as hell but I really mean it. Work will come",

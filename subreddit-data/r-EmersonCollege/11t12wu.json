Just make sure you do orgs/extracurriculars, even if that means helping with random people\u2019s short films. The ridiculous tuition is really only worth it for that and the name on your resume.",

If you don\u2019t have good social skills or don\u2019t know anyone going to Emerson, then think hard and long about if you really want to go here. Pretty much if you don\u2019t have a solid friend group within the first 4-6 weeks, it\u2019ll be pretty hard to find friends. I would agree that it\u2019s very cliquey, people stick with who they know and it\u2019s hard to branch out. The film program itself is fine, i wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s outstanding. I\u2019ve learned some, but not as much as I was hoping to.",

If you don't want to be surrounded by people who are into those artsy hobbies all day, consider a school that isn't mainly for arts.",

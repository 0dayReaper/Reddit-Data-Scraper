            "comment": " While I feel that there are issues with the sexual assault policy, I thought President Pelton's address to the community was well spoken and promises to address a lot of the issues presented in the Huffington Post piece. For example he specifically states: \n&gt; Beginning this fall, the College has taken additional measures, which include, most prominently, a program to establish a culture of consent in our student community through a clearly expressed and mutually understood agreement before engaging in any sexual behavior. The new Creating a Culture of Consent provides valuable information related to the prevention of sexual assault as well as options and resources for survivors of sexual assault.\n\nI hope the women in that article and any others who feel they have not had the support of the community find peace and justice. But I also would like to post Pelton's reply. You can read the letter [here.](http://www.emerson.edu/about-emerson/administration/president/speeches-remarks/emerson-community-letter)",

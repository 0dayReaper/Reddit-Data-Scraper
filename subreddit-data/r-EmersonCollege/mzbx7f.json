    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI got accepted into their pop fiction grad program but I've been having the runaround with when my Financial aid will be available. It has been \"estimated aid\" for the past 2 weeks. I tried contacting different emails like financial aid, refund, bills, you name it. And I got two emails pointing to email a different account. The refund email hasn't even sent a reply.\n\nSo current students,\nWhen did you get your financial aid for the semester starting in May? I just need a brief guesstimate because I am making a school purchase for a new desktop so I can do all my work effectively.\n\nSorry if my post is so long. I've been searching for days for the answer and no one has given it to me.",

It's really okay if you don't know. \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72 let's hope though it comes faster than may just by a little bit so I can feel at ease lol",

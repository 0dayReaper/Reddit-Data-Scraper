    "postText": "Kind of a long post, thanks in advance for reading lol\n\nSo I got into Emerson for fall of 2020 as a freshman (through the waitlist). Super ecstatic and of course I\u2019ve committed and put down my deposit, however with COVID I\u2019ve just been reconsidering my life choices. I was lucky enough to get pretty generous scholarships and financial aid (I\u2019m in-state so I get some extra), but the school is still obviously more expensive than if I went to my state school or community college. We can afford it though and I\u2019m super lucky for that, but with how the next school semester/year might go it seems like it\u2019s not a good idea to pay and not get the full experience of college. Clubs won\u2019t be as active, I have no idea what\u2019s happening with federal work study (which I really need), and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the school went online again and scammed us out of our tuition.\n\nSince I got on from the waitlist, I don\u2019t think I can defer so I\u2019ve been thinking about just committing to my cheap safety school last minute then transferring into Emerson after a year or two, or even just going to CC for a bit. \n\nThe problem is, I\u2019m a bit unfamiliar with the reapplication process and I\u2019ve heard transferring can be tricky. I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t get nearly as much merit scholarships as I did applying as a freshman, and I just barely got in so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they rejected me after reapplying. I feel like going to a cheaper school now might be a good option, but I\u2019m scared of the transfer process being complicated, credits not transferring over, and most importantly if the cost ends up being significantly more than it is now and not getting as much aid as a transfer. \n\nI just don\u2019t want to make the wrong decision right now and commit to a school for media production when my family isn\u2019t amazing financially, at the same time I don\u2019t want to miss this opportunity of getting a huge amount of aid that I probably won\u2019t ever get again. I just need a bit of guidance since my family isn\u2019t super educated on all of the ins and outs of college. Does anyone have any experience with being a transfer and reapplying to Emerson, and is there any advice for what I should do in this situation?\n\n\nEdit: Not sure if anyone was really following this or is in the same boat, but thankfully this year Emerson is giving the option to take online classes for the semester. Doing this would cut down costs significantly without me having to unenroll/reapply for CC so I ended up doing it, I\u2019m still getting my credits but paying much less due to no room and board and scholarships cover most of the rest (I was also thinking of commuting but online made more sense) and I\u2019m going to live on campus second semester. Also applying for the insurance waiver cuts down costs a lot too. Thank you for all the help!",

            "comment": "Hey! I can\u2019t comment on the reapplication process and how that would go, but as far as education quality and bang for your buck, in the world of COVID-19 where classes are online I would almost definitely recommend deferring your acceptance at Emerson.\n\nThe first year at Emerson is almost entirely gen-eds which you can easily take at a community college and save thousands of dollars, if you double check that Emerson will accept those credits.\n\nWhat made Emerson worthwhile for me the first couple years was the clubs I got to be a part of and the state of the art facilities I got to learn in (the television studios for me specifically). Without being able to access those, I don\u2019t think Emerson would be worth it.",

Even if I end up being able to, is there a way to take community college classes during my gap term/year and transfer the credits over? I feel like they wouldn\u2019t allow it if I\u2019m technically enrolled in their school.",

Sorry, I should\u2019ve been more clear haha\n\nI used to take my gen eds at a community college over the summer in between semesters while still enrolled at Emerson. Definitely saved me a lot a cash. There\u2019s a page on Emerson\u2019s website where you can submit classes from other colleges to preapprove that Emerson will accept the credits before you commit to them.",

            "comment": "emerson is such an in person experience, you are more than right to assume how much money emerson will rob u next semester. u will pay $400+ for student fees (nonrefundable) to not be allowed to eat the food and have the things that student orgs buy with that money (speaking as an old eboard member of 2 intercultural orgs). also harsh monies aside, dude emerson has so many cool projects going on all the time every semester, and so many cool things were shut down last semester right after spring break. we were all (individual students AND the student body) shattered and heartbroken, &amp; tbh u deserve more than that from this place ESPECIALLY your freshman year.\n\nmy dramatic advice out of the way, if u jumped the gun and came for a semester or a year and decided you'd like to leave, transferring emerson credits for something other than an elective in another institution is nearly impossible (i tried to leave bc of the cultural shock but i had too many credits), especially because of how specific courses are here, which leads to more money, time, and energy put into getting your (im making an assumption!) first undergraduate degree. a fellow friend from freshman 2017 transferred after a year to northwestern, &amp; was placed on a longer track to completing her first degree. thats how nontransferable even major-related class credits can be.\n\nas of incoming class of 2017, if u go to CC, emerson will not accept more than a certain amount of credits before your junior year &amp; if i remember correctly they have restricted limitations for accepting credits from 2 year institutions (most CCs). so yeah, if the CC in mind is a 2 year institution, try finding a 4 year one or a public uni, that's my other recommendation &amp; the only solid advice i can give as someone who went through transferring credits to emerson (keep in mind that this was an out of state situation, so maybe its easier bc ur a local).\n\nalso emerson is really bad at giving aid tbh :( im not the worst situation i know at emerson (EFC is 0 because of my lack of living &amp; abled bodied working parents, i have scholarships &amp; grants from emerson and last year as a now official MA resident, i also qualified for a MA grant, so the total cost before federal loans is like $12k), and emerson finaid will make you fight tooth and nail to even hear about your financial aid package. if money is a real issue, take my advice tho &amp; please do the safe thing. i regret going here for my undergrad ONLY because of how much money was spent after quickly realizing my dream art industry wasnt even worth dreaming about :(( im getting a degree in history now (and IDIP program emerson has let me build continuously upon), but that's something i could have done while being paid to go to CC... but thats just my situation!\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nbut also final note dont let jaded ol me rain on your parade, bc when i was 18 i was willing to sacrifice everything to move to boston and i did and it worked out and im living my best life very far from a very transphobic household. the next game plan for u could be just doing the deferral or a leave of absence (just not signing up for classes for up to a year), going to a CC or local public uni and accumulate NO MORE THAN 60 CREDITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, and then transferring those back. i recommend taking a speech communication class outside of emerson too bc its a graduation requirement and tbh its worth more its price when u take those types of classes outside of emerson (because there are. SO. MANY. COOL CLASSES AT EMERSON. trust me on this, take all ur lib arts elsewhere and then come back and take classes that change you global perspective and also your life).",

I think I\u2019m going to consider the community college route for a year or so, and thanks for letting me know about not doing more than 60 credits. I really want to go to this school but it doesn\u2019t seem worth it when it won\u2019t be a full experience. \n\nI mentioned this in another comment but I\u2019m concerned about deferring since I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible to take community college courses while technically enrolled at Emerson. In this case, would it be a good idea to unenroll and go somewhere else then reapply to Emerson again? My concern with that is if I do reapply as a transfer from a state school/CC, I probably won\u2019t get generous aid like I did applying as a freshman. Idk, it\u2019s all so confusing and I\u2019m not sure what to do. Don\u2019t want to make any mistakes :(",

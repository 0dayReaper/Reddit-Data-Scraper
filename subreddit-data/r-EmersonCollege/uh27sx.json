    "postText": "I just barely passed all my courses this semester because I figured I could just do a pass/fail and my parents would be none the wiser. I slacked off HARD and basically put all my efforts into my short film. Now, however, one of my suitemates is telling me my parents can see the grade regardless, which would be bad. They warned me that if I didn\u2019t get my act together they would stop paying for school. \n\nI could also perhaps beg my professors to raise my grade, they might be sympathetic to plight. I also know I have blackmail on at least on of my Professors, so that\u2019s something.\n\nThoughts?",

Isn\u2019t it illegal to share that information with anyone but you without permission?\n\nUpdate:\n\n\u201cThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nFERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are \"eligible students.\"\u201d\n\nhttps://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html",

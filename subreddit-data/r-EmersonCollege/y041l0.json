    "postText": "Throwaway account:\n\nSo fall classes have been going for a while now and I don\u2019t want to be dramatic, but I worry that I am the victim of a targeted harassment campaign. As the title suggests: nobody is sitting next to me in class. \n\nAt first I didn\u2019t really even think anything of it, I actually kinda like having a corner of the room to myself.  But as the weeks have gone on it is clear something else is at play. Sometimes people will sit next to me but then move before class starts, this has become so common that I have even confronted someone about it and they just have a vague answer about some \u201c\u201dfriend\u201d\u201d they wanted to sit next to (I know they\u2019re not friends). In one particularly egregious example, a girl was actually assigned to sit next to me, then talked to the professor after class and was MOVED the next day.  This has been going on so long that I have even begun to sit next to people right before class starts but, without fail, they will move within 5 minutes. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m doing anything wrong, I\u2019m just sitting there minding my business. I would talk to a professor but I think they\u2019re in on it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

Maybe no \"offensive\" smells on you like cigarettes or even food in your bag?\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this (I'm sympathetic as someone who went through Emerson and made almost no friends) but the targeted harassment idea reads like severe anxiety, especially to think professors are in on it. If it's anything at all then it's more likely an in-the-moment thing, either hygiene like I said before or you're keeping to yourself and coming off as cold or unfriendly. Maybe just try chatting with people and see if they still keep their distance?",

Based on your description of the situation and both of your responses, saying first that \"many people\" have commented on a noticeable scent and next that you don't shower unless you're visibly dirty, I can say with some level of certainty that people are avoiding you in the classroom because of a smell. I can't stop you if you wish to believe it's targeted harassment but I'm encouraging you to try showering daily to see if you're received more warmly by your classmates. Good luck.",

I used to sit in the front, realize they are seats in the back and move back because I\u2019m not gonna pay attention. Other times i\u2019d sit in the back, realize I can\u2019t see, and move forward or more center. I also gotta agree with the other comment about hygiene. If you smell of smoke, weed, or something else, people will move away.",

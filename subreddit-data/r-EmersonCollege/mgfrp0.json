I am someone who likes to be around people but I tend to keep to myself. What is the overall gist of the school? Would someone like me do well there? What is the WLP program like?",

I'm a pretty introverted person and I've had an alright time here, mostly keeping to myself. I will say that the WLP program is pretty good -- tons of experienced faculty and lots of inspiration.",

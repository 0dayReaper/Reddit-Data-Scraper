            "comment": "Junior/Senior VMA here. Honestly I feel like Emerson students fall into one of three categories: 1. Hyper-extraverted theater kids who you feel like could break into song at any particular moment. 2. Edgy edgelords who hate everything and all music that isn't indie punk alternative and want to tell stories that are \"gritty\" and \"real\". 3. Normal-ass people who are just chill, like what they like, and make what they make. While the first one makes up a good portion of the students, followed by the second, most people are pretty chill here in my experience.",

Even if they don't, they are likely middle class and above and they can afford to buy iced coffee every day. If you fall into this category you will fit in, but if you don't have money for trendy clothes and Tatte then you will feel left out. \nAlso, despite it's liberal trappings I have encountered homophobia and racism.\nThis is not to say that you shouldn't come here. I have been given some amazing opportunities because of Emerson and I'm currently finishing my BFA with job prospects. Just be prepared for snobby stuck up people.",

My experience with Emerson is that students are very involved in the clubs and extra activities...to the point where that becomes a lot of their personality. This isn't a bad thing, because there are a lot of club options, but it will be what people want to talk about. Also, students in general are very liberal and very outspoken about political values. Depending on what your major is or what program you end up in will also determine a lot of who you end up spending a lot of your time with. VMAs tend to spend time with other VMA, and likewise with Theatre majors because a lot of the projects are very collaborative and don't cross disciplines too often. Not to say that you can't get involved with VMA or theatre projects if you aren't one of those majors, but they'll be slightly harder to find and you'll have to seek them out.",

The food is bad, the kids are all super woke (they were cancelling disney movies in one of my classes last week), and they reallllyyy don't like athletes. I'm on one of emersons sports teams and every week we get baseless anonymous complaints from students who are trying to shut down sports. This is a very accepting place... As long as you fit in or are intersectional. The classes are very easy, and there is little emphasis on academic integrity so kids cheat all the time. People who don't like school come here, I've been told that I'm the most studious person in my grade because I get all my work in on time and put in extra effort on it to make it impressive. If you value higher education, this is not the place for you. You will be given a lot of opportunities to talk about social problems, but not much else as emerson offers no math classes and few science-y classes. People here are also really sensitive, I would compare them to the kind of people that you see Tucker Carlson make fun of, or the kind of people you think you would only see on the internet. While a large amount of kids here are nice, I've found that I have to be careful with who I talk to because a lot of the kids are super weird and don't understand how to be social. Also, they sing hamilton songs in the common rooms, there is virtually no campus, and boston gets pretty damn cold.\n\nAll in all, this is a great school for people that are theater majors who don't like STEM, and for lgbt students but otherwise, I don't see the appeal\n\nTL:DR Emerson isn't for everybody, know what you're getting into",

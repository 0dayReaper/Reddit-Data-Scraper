    "postText": "There have been a lot of posts recently of people asking about whether or not they should come to the school, and the answer is no. You shouldn't. Under no circumstances should you come here.\n\nThe school isn't bad, but it frankly is not worth $70,000 \\* 4. Even if you have a scholarship, this school isn't worth half of that. This school does not offer anything which would even potentially make it worth going into debt for your whole life.\n\nIf you come from a really wealthy family and want to blow some money on this place, sure, go to Emerson, you'll have a great time. Everyone else, it's not worth it.\n\nAlso, I did have a good time at this school, this is not a post from anger. This school is good. It's just not good enough to justify coming here lmao",

            "comment": "I always thought the kids who went to community college for 2 years and transferred into Emerson were smart. I actually have benefited a lot from the name and network of the school. Been 9 years since I graduated and I'm pretty happy with my career thus far. If you're passionate about film, USC and NYU are objectively better schools and I regret not trying to get into USC, which is also expensive and arguably overpriced.\n\nIf you do get in, TRY YOUR FUCKING HARDEST to get into the castle and the LA film program (if you're a film student). The castle was the happiest 3 months of my life. And I think doing the LA film program would have shaved about 6 months to a year off the start of my career out here in LA.\n\nCollege is worthwhile, even if its expensive. I graduated with $30k in debt and took a decade to pay it off, which felt manageable. I wouldn't recommend going if you expect to finish with much more than that in debt, but overall I felt Emerson was very worthwhile, and the name does mean something in the industry.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going to drop this in here as a current student graduating this semester. Do not come to Emerson.\n\nFrom my experience and from my friends\u2019 experiences, if you especially need financial aid to pay for Emerson do not come here. The past four years when I applied for aid the Financial Aid Office has been by far one of the worst experiences I\u2019ve had (I\u2019m not wealthy or low income, in the middle). They\u2019ve managed to lose the documents I sent over, forgotten to add in documents, and added last minute requirements; it\u2019s been nearly impossible to get aid. \n\nI\u2019ve had friends with lower income than me not receive any aid at all and they had to drop out of Emerson because they couldn\u2019t afford it. \n \nWe had a problem (I believe last year) where low income students were stealing instant food from school cafes because they ran out of meal swipes at the dining hall and were going hungry. The pantries were rarely restocked and the Student Assistance Fund was in need of being replenished. Emerson\u2019s solution was to put video cameras in the cafes to fix this issue. Students were still going hungry.\n\nThis is when the Emerson community got together and made a Facebook group chat for people who needed to be swiped in for a meal (you can guest swipe people in at least twice if I recall correctly). People would request a swipe in the chat, and someone who was available would just come down to the dining hall and swipe them in so they could eat. \n\nI value the friends and most of the professors (there was one tenured Professor that is disliked by everyone, staff and student whose known for bullying students in class). Emerson has given me direction to what I want to do in the future, though they haven\u2019t been very helpful in getting me there. \n\nBut as a college itself, how the school has handled student issues (the sexual assaults, tuition raises, unpaid professors, etc.) it isn\u2019t worth it. Tuition is increasing every year and Emerson is getting even more unaffordable than it already is. I\u2019m terrified just how expensive it\u2019s going to get. Emerson isn\u2019t worth the tuition they are making you pay.",

Woof.  \n\nI will agree with a commenter on here though, the Castle was 1,000% worth it and 15 years later I still miss it and think about it almost daily, and my best friends to this day are from the Castle.",

    "postText": "Hi hi! So I\u2019m in the middle of filling out my housing form, as an incoming freshman, and I was wondering if someone could explain the benefits/effects of joining a learning community or special interest area. Does it provide any extra opportunities? Or does it lower or raise the chance of you getting a single dorm?\n\nIf anyone has specific insight on the Film Immersion or Quiet Area categories specifically, that would be super helpful!",

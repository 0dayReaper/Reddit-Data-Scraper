I have been looking through Master's programs and have become attached to the publishing and writing masters program at Emerson but have many questions.  (I am currently an English major with a writing minor and interested in working in the overall publishing industry behind the scenes not as a writer).\n\n1. How hard is it to get into the program? Should I be doing anything extra now to get a better chance?\n2. How is life in Boston overall and is the community in Emerson good?\n3. Is it worth it to go into this program?",

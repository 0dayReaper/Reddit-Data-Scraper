And if there are those who did graduate from the program, I'm just curious how quickly did you get a job in the field or how helpful career services were. \n\nAny feedback or comments would be great! Thanks! :)",

I was already working in marketing but I landed a new job within a few months of completing the program. I didn't use the career services though. \n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions!",

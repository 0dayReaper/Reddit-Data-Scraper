    "postText": " Hey everyone!\n\nI've seen a couple posts on people venting about how crappy this semester is, so I wanted to create a safe place for everyone to share how they're really doing. At the end of the day, college is getting harder and harder. The combination of zoom fatigue, covid fatigue, countless work, colder and darker days, and still being isolated is truly detrimental to our mental health. It seems like there's no escape and feeling this way is simply becoming normalized...\n\nAs a psych major, I'm really invested in mental health and being there for others. I've had a really hard time this semester, and I know a lot of you have too. Creating this instagram account may be something really small, but I figured if anyone wanted to have a safe place to let some thoughts go (and to see they're not alone) then that could be really positive. I named it Project Uncaged for the symbolism of breaking away from the stigma that we have to be okay all the time and handle everything on our own.\n\nJust fill out the form and I'll post it (anonymously)\n\n[https://forms.gle/fr9wParJLz3kjDzX7](https://forms.gle/fr9wParJLz3kjDzX7)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/project.uncaged/](https://www.instagram.com/project.uncaged/)\n\nThat's all, check it out if you'd like :) Be well x",

            "comment": "In order:  \n\n\nThe mafia is real, and is better at finding you a job than Emerson's own career services. If you come out to LA at least, Emerson College has some weight to it, but don't really rely on it. You'll do fine in the job search if you spend your time wisely at school. By wisely I mean working on lots of projects.  \n\n\nNYC has work, and I know a lot of successful people that are over there right now. Just keep in mind that LA has much more work out there for someone in Film than NYC. Also look into Vancouver or Atlanta, as they are bigger production cities than New York.  \n\n\nSocial Scene is mostly parties in cramped apartments. Occasionally, a party house will pop up. I'm sure you've seen some greek life advertised for Emerson College. It does exist, but it's not at all like other colleges where there's a specific frat house and so on. I'd say it's better because there's not really as much Hazing and that, and people are generally very supportive of each other. My best advice for the social scene if you're a production major is to work on a lot of sets. Camaraderie runs high on sets and you'll make a lot of friends. ",

As a WLP major who now works in publishing, I also found the classes useful in a practical way and parlayed my experience in Pub Club into internships while at Emerson and job right when I graduated, which really helped get past the \"x years minimum experience\" you see on a lot of entry-level jobs. I guess the biggest thing I can say is that if I could go back in time, I wouldn't choose a different college, which I think is about the most you can ask from such a big life decision.",

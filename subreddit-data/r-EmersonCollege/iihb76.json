I\u2019m leaning towards Emerson, but am admittedly hesitant because it\u2019s significantly more expensive than other online MA/MS Digital Marketing programs. \n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I just started the program this year, but I chose Emerson because its narrow focus included data analytics and the fact that I knew people that enjoyed their undergrad experience there. I like how there's a physical campus to visit for resources (which is not an option for me right now due to the pandemic, but it was appealing when I applied). The program uses Canvas to complete/submit coursework and I was already familiar with the system, which was a plus. I also felt very supported during the application process. \n\nI'd be happy to answer any other questions you have! It's only been 2 weeks since the program started for me but I'll do my best!",

I\u2019m local to the area as well and agree - being able to (hopefully/one day) use the campus resources will be a big bonus vs. other remote programs. Funny enough, the application process and admissions have been great for me as well. It\u2019s definitely a great feeling when the school seems equally excited to have you, as you are to apply.\n\nI definitely will hit you up again (if you don\u2019t mind) as I\u2019d love to keep in touch on how things are going for you!",

I feel that the concepts and techniques that I'm learning are exactly what I was looking for in a masters program. My professors are very involved with the classes, easy to reach, and reply within 24 hours. Some downsides are that the classes are structured so similarly that right now I have two upcoming projects due on the same day (and I'm definitely avoiding working on them right now). Group projects are a little difficult with the online environment but can be accomplished as long as everyone communicates effectively. I feel that Emerson provides a lot of useful resources outside of coursework like networking/social events and guest lecturers, but sometimes they're announced last minute. Overall, I'm really glad I chose a program that was designed to be online. Due to the pandemic it seems like a lot of students are postponing education plans or considering a leave of absence from school to get a full program experience later, but I don't feel the need to do that.",

I\u2019m really glad to hear that you feel like there is still a sense of community, as that was something that worried me with the online format. But as far as being able to balance working full time work, it makes the most sense (I think). I\u2019m excited but also anxious to start! I\u2019m just waiting to hear back on FASFA now. \ud83d\ude05",

Emerson has both Mac and Windows loaded on all its machines either natively or via a virtual machine. Whatever selection you make will blend seamlessly. \n\nBrand is more a matter of price and aesthetic, less import than operating system. For OS I would say continue using what you\u2019re already comfortable and most proficient with.",

We've got [a whole article on the IT site](https://support.emerson.edu/hc/en-us/articles/205704375-Purchasing-a-Personal-Computer) about choosing a personal computer for Emerson - You might also want to poke someone in Media Arts/Production about any specific requirements for your program, like if you'll need something for specific media encoding, or audio peripherals. You can also shoot us a line at helpdesk@emerson.edu if you're got any questions!  \n  \n  (EDIT: See post below)",

From the update email sent by President Pelton, it sounded like classes were going to be at least partially held in person. The email was very vague, but he phrased it like we would be having on-campus classes. Am I missing some info here or maybe misunderstanding the email?",

While the email from Pelton optimistically says we'll look into reopening, and while I can confirm that people are returning to *work* on campus, I'm still unsure as to whether or not the campus will reopen for \"normal\" classes in the Fall.  \n  \n  EDIT: I've updated the [COVID-19 Updates page](https://old.reddit.com/r/EmersonCollege/comments/fir4px/its_corona_time_emerson_college_covid19_updates/) - the school currently plans to offer abbreviated in-person instruction for the Fall 2020 Semester.",

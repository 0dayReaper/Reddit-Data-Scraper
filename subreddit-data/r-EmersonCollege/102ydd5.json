            "comment": "Hey! Lol was lurking but noticed this was still unanswered. So I didn't end up going to Emerson despite getting in (main reason it was too expensive). But I know someone that did and they said that it's a great environment with lots of motivated and driven students that want to succeed in film and really in any other field they wanna pursue. This fosters a lot of creativity and production, there's always going to be a project you could be a part of, at least from what I've heard. The equipment and facilities are also great. You'll learn a lot of skills going here.\n\nBut if tuition is an issue I'd say really look into ur options. Emerson is not in a big film city, that could be a downside. I live in NY and even from not going to Emerson but just by joining film oriented programs and whatnot, I've still been able to talk to film students from all over. Most importantly, because NY is a big hub for film, I've also met dozens of professionals that actually work in the film industry, that have been in this business for years. \n\nI dont regret my decision because I realized that New York is where I need to be in the film scene, I'm paying wayyy less money going to a local college here by just being smart abt my connections and just by putting myself out there.\n\nAnyways I digress... but I also feel there are a ton of upside to going to Emerson. If you absolutely have no other way to make friends or connections in film and Emerson is a way out of that, then go. Because I'm sure if you use your time and resources wisely, you'll succeed, there are a tonnn of resources there and students are hard working and motivated. Gl!",

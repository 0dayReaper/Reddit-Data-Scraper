    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a senior in HS currently and debating between Emerson and Ithaca College for a major in film. I\u2019m from NYC, so I\u2019m not super keen on being in a big city and I would really prefer a campus, but I\u2019ve heard great things about Emerson. However, is it mostly just art students? Any advice on where to go?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m planning on going to Emerson (unless NYU takes me off the waitlist lol) and I\u2019m very excited. I chose Emerson because of all of the opportunities  for a film student to take advantage of. In my opinion, film school is all about what you make out of it and Emerson has enough connections for a driven student to get what they want out of it. The fact that Emerson has taken the time and effort to build a network of regions (LA, Paris, etc.) shows that there is a lot to work with at the school. Networking is key! \nOn another note, I live in Ithaca NY, about 10 mins from Ithaca College. From what I\u2019ve heard the school is very nice and the area is beautiful. However, upstate New York is likely to present you with less opportunities to network than a large city. Honestly I\u2019ve really enjoyed living here but I personally believe a larger city, at this point in my life, is better for me and my artistic pursuits. I would also like to mention that Emerson\u2019s film program is much more established than IC\u2019s, not say IC doesn\u2019t have a good program, but it seems like Emerson\u2019s would be better. \nI would only recommend you go to IC over Emerson if it were substantially cheaper than going to Emerson. But from what I\u2019ve seen, both schools are absurdly expensive.\nAnyway, I hope I\u2019ve helped a little bit!",

Nyu has the prestige but it didn\u2019t justify the 30k/yr difference it would\u2019ve been for me, especially when factoring in how many things nyu makes you pay for that Emerson covers.",

I did get an academic scholarship to IC, which is making me lean more towards there, and the fact that I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Boston as a whole. However, Emerson\u2019s opportunities seem great. What was living in Ithaca like though? It is a nice area?",

There is definitely a good mix of rural and urban in Ithaca. There are lots of super pretty places to visit. Honestly if you don\u2019t really want to go to a big city I think Ithaca could be very enjoyable.",

            "comment": "I had this same problem, recently committed to IC instead of Emerson or Boston University. My family knows a few people high up in the film business and I was able to speak to them about my decision. They all recommend the school with less debt and one where you feel the most comfortable. They spoke pretty highly about both schools. Emerson, if it is out of your price range, is probably not worth the debt. Ithaca College is also probably not worth the debt if it is out of your price range. Emerson is not worth the extra money and before I get downvoted I would say the same about IC if it was the more expensive option. Choose the one where you have less debt and make sure you do internships as much as possible. Both schools have reviews that say they helped them get into the business, they also both have reviews that say they left them in the dust and they couldn\u2019t find a decent job.",

            "comment": "Emerson was my top choice when I first started My college selection. Unless your able to afford it or you get some good aid (Emerson isn\u2019t really known for being good at giving aid) then I\u2019m not sure how entirely worth it it compared to more expensive schools like NYU and USC. I\u2019d say a cheaper school that is equivalent to Emerson\u2019s program (arguable better in my opinion) is UT Austin. Supposedly one of the best bang for your buck film schools out their. Also Austin isn\u2019t too big of a city and it\u2019s quite nice. Also supposedly a an up and coming bang for your buck school is UNCSA. It\u2019s a different pace to UT Austin (smaller liberal arts school vs. big public school) but it\u2019s still cheap compared to most film schools. My biggest regret from college selection this past year was not applying there. In the end film schools not really about the degree it\u2019s what you make out of it while your there. Lots of people will trash specific schools, mostly bc they went and did little work and felt like there degree should of helped jump start them into the industry. You can really go to any some what est. school or even a totally overpriced school and make a name for your self if you work your butt off.\n\nAlso sorry I thought you were a Jr. in high school I guess it\u2019s a little too late to apply elsewhere. Id say go witch is best financially for you unless paying for college isn\u2019t a big deal. Also Emerson is know for being super duper liberal and artsy. Not sure if that bothers you. Personally that\u2019s why I was attracted to it, but if that concerns you it may not be a good choice.",

I was very particular about being in a small school in the northeast, not really sure as to why now. And I like how Emerson is known to be a very liberal and artsy school! However I feel like I\u2019m looking for some diversity in the students, not just art students, ya know?",

I would say that if you\u2019re going be looking for a change from NYC, Emerson\u2019s downtown campus is going to be more of the same for you. \n\nI would say take your time in making the selection, enjoy the process. Imagine yourself on the different campuses, role play the different opportunities and limitations each one may present. Go with the choice where you imagine your best happiest self.",

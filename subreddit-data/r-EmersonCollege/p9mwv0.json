I know Emerson doesn\u2019t let us bring in much furniture but has anyone here bought a nicer/more comfortable chair for their room? I\u2019m just worried because I\u2019ll be spending most of my time at the desk:(",

Though our RAs knew about the chair and were pretty lenient about it, so I'm not sure what your situation will be.\n\nI never really sat at my desk much, even after leaving Paramount... I instead bought one of those body pillows from Costco and used it as a back rest on my bed.",

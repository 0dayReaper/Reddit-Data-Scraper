They tell me my taste in movies is \u201camateurish\u201d and I don\u2019t really belong at such a \u201cprestigious\u201d film school. This all honestly caught me by surprise, I love all kinds of movies, especially Tarantino and Nolan who are not exactly \u201cmainstream.\u201d I literally understood TENET the FIRST time I saw it WITHOUT reading the Wikipedia page. Anyway, I\u2019d appreciate any recommendations that make me look smarter than my A24-cuck suite-mates. I don\u2019t like anything that doesn\u2019t have action though\u2026",

Maybe just try a couple more films without going in with a negative attitude. I started out the same, was annoyed with many of the artsy fartsy classics. But I was pleasantly surprised by a couple of them here and there.\n\n Being a director requires a lot of adaptability, and while I'm not saying you should force yourself to watch a bunch of shit you don't care about, it's important for anyone working on film sets to have knowledge of film history and significant films, or else you seem naive/ignorant/disinterested, and thus might be passed up for someone who IS more open-minded and knowledgeable. I wish you good luck.Try Letterboxd to find more films up your alley while also being great classics.",

So I can at least relate there. \n\nBut, at the same time, I do feel like your attitude will end up restricting you from your long-term goal. If you\u2019re not open to learning about films you don\u2019t personally like, I find it hard to see how you can bring anything new to action movies/\u201cTarantino-isms\u201d in the future. Just an opinion! \n\nAll that said, if someone asked me for action film recs to satisfy film snobs, I would probably send them to John Wick, Nolan, and Tarantino, and you\u2019re already covered there. \n\nThe only real thing I can think of that could maybe turn the tide for you would be to do a deep dive on the non-Daniel Craig James Bond movies. Or, for an even broader scope, popular \u201caction\u201d (way less action-y than we are used to) movies in the 70s, 60s, 50s, 40s, and 30s. I know it can be tough to weed through stuff that doesn\u2019t fit your comfort level as far as pacing and excitement, but I\u2019m sure there is at least a handful of movies from those decades that you can like, and use to develop your movie palette. From these decades, you might have a better chance finding action in westerns, detective movies, and so on. \n\nLast, but not least, I would maybe consider looking into \u201caction\u201d that leans sci-fi, or is sci-fi. I feel like that\u2019s one genre/theme that\u2019s easy to lean into if you\u2019re a fan of action. And, if you consider doing that, I would try to restrict yourself to 70s, 80s, 90s. \n\nAfter typing all of this, another thing has just occurred to me\u2014If you\u2019re really this intensely set on the type of movies that you\u2019re talking about, and you\u2019re just not interested in the movies your suite-mates are, why not just have the guts to tell them that you don\u2019t care what they think? Or ignore them? If you\u2019re that committed to your shtick, stick to it, and don\u2019t let them get to you. If you can\u2019t ignore them, it\u2019s probably because part of you thinks they\u2019re right in regards to you needing to broaden your taste.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Old movies are pretty hard for me to watch because I generally don\u2019t like watching movies without (modern) A list actors. Additionally I found older movies don\u2019t really have great action set pieces like say, Infinity War. Still, I\u2019ll try it out, even if it\u2019s outside my comfort zone, I just don\u2019t want other people to think I\u2019m not as smart as them just because I didn\u2019t like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d or \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d",

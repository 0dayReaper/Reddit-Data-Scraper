    "postText": "Holy cow,\n\nI am an incoming Emerson student and I am overwhelmed by the sheer incompetence of their student facing online communication. From the deluge of redundant, untargeted emailing, to unbelievably laughable scattershot approach to online portals. My public highschool had it's stuff more together than this. Like I get if you come here for the arts, film and theater or even journalism to some extent, but the fact that people come here for communications is sort of mind-bending. I'd be like, \"these are the people who are teaching me SEO? Website design? How to do professional communications in the year of our lord 2021?! Is it too late to transfer?\"  \n\n\nIt's absolutely wild, and I would keep track of all the little bureaucratic, design, and coms irritations/fails but honestly, they should be paying someone to beta test their jank ass web presence and I just can't be asked.",

Lots of other stuff I dont feel like listing. Emerson does a lot of stuff super well but infrastructure... nah.",

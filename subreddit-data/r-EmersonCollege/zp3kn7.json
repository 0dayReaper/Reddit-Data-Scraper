I\u2019m really grateful for this scholarship but that still leaves me with about $45k/yr to pay which I can\u2019t afford \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso, does anyone know how generous Emerson tends to be with need-based aid? I\u2019m trying to apply for a dependency override which would put me at the &gt;30k income threshold. \n\nThank you!",

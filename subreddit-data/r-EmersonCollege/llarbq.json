    "postText": "Hey there. We're two journalists who are starting a news platform because we are dedicated to making the world a better informed place. As you know, fake news and misinformation have metastasized on social platforms leading to a lack of trust in media (among other things). We want to be the first platform dedicated to news, made for mobile &amp; built by journalists from the ground up.\n\nWe are looking to take what people like about social media -- the format in which info is delivered -- and pair that with journalistic integrity\n\nAnd we're starting locally.\u00a0\n\nWe're launching a new news platform in town and want to make it as useful to you as possible -- and we'd love your help (please!). [**This survey**](https://forms.gle/fyNME2RoHJjQY9hw9) **takes 2 mins to fill out.** We want to fix local news and make it more appealing to this generation.\u00a0\n\nThanks for making us better!\u00a0",

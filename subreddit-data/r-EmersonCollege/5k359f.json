            "comment": "I think the Emerson Mafia is very, very real, but somewhat different than what people advertise.\n\nI've gotten a multitude of job offers and internship offers simply due to knowing someone who works at Emerson who knew someone who was hiring. Additionally, just having Emerson on a resume greatly increases your chances of being hired. Emerson people are everywhere, and they *always* seem to look out for their own. Emerson graduates are skilled and talented, and we leave our mark on the industry. \n\nJust a few months ago I sat down for a job interview and the interviewer said, \"Oh, Emerson! I love people from Emerson. We have a lot of you guys here and you always work out so well.\" Even when people didn't go to Emerson, chances are they know someone who did that they can speak highly of.\n\nI'm in the television industry, so I can only speak for our impact on the TV/Film world. I'm assuming the same goes for some business communications and marketing communications people, but I can't speak for everyone!",

All depends on who sees your post in the group and how willing they are. \n\nBut again, I've had very little experience with it so far, so maybe someone else could give some insight.",

My first full time job as a result of that internship bought my house that I currently live in. It's pretty real but I wouldn't go off the Facebook group page as an indication of its success. The Emerson mafia has gone through several online communities. Facebook and google are just their current incarnations.  \n\nYou're bound to find lots of successful people at all stages of the industry who will do little things like put your resume on the top of a stack or casually suggest that this person looked a bit better than the others, hence the mafia mentality.

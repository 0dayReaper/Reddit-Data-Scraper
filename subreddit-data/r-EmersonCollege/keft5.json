    "postText": "\nDear Freshman Fucks, and the like.\n\nAs a senior destined to graduate shortly, I felt it pertinent to share some of the tips and tricks that I have learned over these years as a college student. I lived in the dorms for over 3 years, and learned a few things about not giving a fuck, and not getting in too much trouble.\n\n**DRINKING**\n\n*where to get some*\n\nSo, you wanna get your drink on do you? Unfortunately as this is a bit of a public forum, I can't straight up give away the liquor stores that don't card, and most of them do. BUT! If you get a decent enough fake, (research ISIC), then some places will just serve you. Some bars downtown will serve you if you seem like you belong. Afternoon hours, or before 7pm is your best bet to get a beer. But, remember, don't be some nervous asshole otherwise it will never work. Ask one of your European friends how is done in a country without  arbitrary laws that only serve to cause more problems. \n\nOf course, you can always ask an upperclassman,  your brother, your bother's friend, or that asshole that charges you $5 bucks (me), to fetch you some shit. Mr. Boston Vodka is dirt cheap and gets you drunk like a skunk. Despite what Mythbusters might tell you, it actually does make a difference to pour it through a Brita filter, turning your bottom shelf vodka into midshelf. I recommend mixing it with those awesome Nantucket Nectars from The Max, gotta put those BoardBucks to some sort of use. \n\nOff Campus parties is also a way to some shitty Natty Light or PBR, but avoid the Allston thing. Every party in Allston is a guaranteed shit show. If the police do show up, don't fucking freak out. They don't give a shit about you. Just put away your weed and walk out the front door. Alright bub?\n\n**SMOKING WEED**\n\nYes you can smoke in the dorms, you probably shouldn't, but you totally can. Use the room furthest away from the door. Make sure the front door is locked.\nMake a sploof (look it up). Towel the door. And don't smoke in the shower, the vent often connects to the hallway so you just end up stinking up your floor.\n\nAlways have a window open, cover the firearm with a baggy (but don't forget to take it off, that's a $100 fine if they catch you, and if they do catch you, it was for cigarettes).\n\nOr, you can not wreck yourself and go outside to the Common like every other fuck does. \n\nAlso buying weed at Emerson is easier than fucking a gay guy. That is, everybody knows somebody or is somebody who sells. Are you some goddamn freshman? Find a Junior or Senior that somehow is willing to talk to you and they will know somebody who sells.\n\nPrices are generally as follows:\n\n* 1    gram   $20\n* 2    grams  $40\n* 3.5 grams  $60\n* Quarter     $110 \n\nThis is what you should be paying for Headies, the good shit. Middies should be cheaper. Other drugs are also available, but harder to find. \n\n\n**RA'S**\n\nSo your suckling down on a bong and you hear a knock at the door. Your blasting away 'Ghost N' Stuff' shouting that you love dustup and chugging Wild Turkey and the RA is at your door. What to do?\n\n1. don't fucking freak out\n2. DON'T FREAK OUT!\n3. keep them music going\n4. clean up your evidence, stash that bong, hide ALL evidence of acohol in drawers, fridges and cabinets. Shot glasses, beer cans, bottle caps, anything that they can use. Clear it all the fuck up. \n5. let them knock and knock and knock until it is all cleared away.\n7. If you were smoking weed in one room, close that door, and move to another room to hang out. \n6. then turn off the music\n7. let them knock again\n8. feign ignorance \"oh sounds like someone is at the door\"\n\n\nhere is what you should say \n\nRA: Hello, yes. We heard a lot of noise coming from here and we \nneed to ask you to turn it down.\n\nYOU: of course.\n\nRA: also, we heard some clinking of bottles. Would you mind if we took a look?\n\nYOU: Go ahead.\n\nThey'll step inside, if nothing stands out, THEY WILL LEAVE! RA'S (mostly) hate busting kids, they don't think drinking is wrong, and they are just following orders like some other people we know. They're slaves to a fucked up system in trade of free housing. Remember, these are people who have surrendered some aspect of their morals for a cheeping living space, so when they can avoid acting upon their supposed evil intent, they will.\n\nRA: \tWhy is this door locked? Can we look inside?\n\nYOU: \tThat's not my room. \n\nRA: \tWho lives here?\n\nYOU: \tBob does, he's not here. \n\nRA: \tIt smells a little weedy in here. Were you getting high?\n\nYOU:  No\n\nRA:\tAre you sure?\n\nYOU:  Yes.\n\n*ALWAYS LIE!*\nwell, almost always. For weed, they need to find it before they can do anything. So even if your eyes are red, your blazed off your skull, unless they find some fucking evidence, they have nothing on you.\n\nLying is generally a good idea when faced with a illogical system. If you can fool them by not telling the truth, then do so. Sometimes you can appeal to their logic or reason, but this is rarely the case. Pretend you weren't doing anything wrong, even if you were, and even if they know you were, and most of the time, you'll get away with it.\n\nAlso, if you do get busted, fined and they force you to go to CHOICES, you can totally skip that shit. Or go anyway, it's kinda fun and you'll meet some new drinking buddies, like the kids who run it. \n\nNext, I'll explain how to download a ton of music and movies and not get busted for P2P filesharing. Also where to fuck if you have roommate in your room. \n\nUPDATE:\n**WHERE TO FUCK THAT HOT GUY/GIRL (BOTH) EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A ROOMMATE\n**\n\nSo, this kinda only works if you have somebody who you've already fucked, or is cool fucking at an arranged location. This isn't the best for seducing someone. The solution is quite simple.\n\nCommon Rooms. Yes! Now, what you do is you simply take one of those door wedges with you, find an empty common room, wedge the door and have at it. Now if you find this not to enough privacy, the bathrooms inside the common rooms are often very large and clean.\n\nNow if some loser is studying or playing mario kart in each common room, and nothing is available, there is always the Piano Row handicapped stall in the lobby. There is so much room for activities there, and since almost nobody ever uses those, it's often cleaner than your bed anyway. Besides, you get paper towels to wipe up any mess. If your on the down-low you can arrange to meet someone there and have a little secret knock. It was great fun pretending I needed to study and then go blow a load into this closet case and then get back with nobody being the wiser.  \n\n**HOW TO DOWNLOAD MOVIES/GAMES/SOFTWARE and not get BUSTED**\n\nFirst of all, use your ethernet. Not because it's safer, but because Emerson's ethernet is wicked fast. For some reason the fastest seems to be in The Ansin building, but anywhere should really do.\n\nSecondly, don't torrent. Torrents are what get students busted, and considering the new legislation  colleges and universities are now legally required to assist the RIAA, MPAA and the such with busting kids. Besides the fact that everybody I know, myself included, who downloads a crazy amount of media also watches, listens and pays for a crazy amount of media, bla bla bla whatever.\n\nWhat to do? \nUse FTP, USENET, or RAPIDSHARE/MEGAUPLOAD/FILESHARE type service. Yes, this will cost you some money. I pay about $10 a month, or a $100 a year to access a USENET server which allows me to download Breaking Bad the very fucking minute it is done airing. \n\nHow do you use Usenet? You have a mac, that's a given. So first things first (I eat your brains), download http://sabnzbd.org/ (also works for pc), this is downloader, it works straight from your browser. It's very easy to use and most of the instructions are on the website.\n\nI use the Supernews servers since they are reliable and fast and allow unlimited amount of connections.  Here is a link to a promo they have http://www.supernews.com/super-special/ \n\nTo find files to download you can use binsearch.info or nzbmatrix.com (although that one requires a payment to get older files). \n\nFor the megaupload fileshares type deals, you pay for access to their servers and can find files on filestube.com\n\nIt's all about downloading, and not uploading. That's what they get you with. When you upload they can claim you have helped spread the file and can fine you for each exchange, that is what allows absurd million dollar fines and the like. Eventually these crusty old cunt judges will die off and copyright will be rewritten, but until then, be safe. \n\nRequests for more or other information will be noticed. ",

            "comment": "As a veteran RA, I'd like to correct this. The vast majority of RAs are people who genuinely like their jobs and just want to make college as awesome as possible for their residents. Every single RA HATES having to bust drunk idiots late at night.\n\nIs the system flawed? Yes. Can we make it easier on each other? Yes. Yes, my friends, we can. \n\nHere's what you should keep in mind: Any punishment you receive following any interaction with any RA is based on what that RA thinks of you. And oh you bet your bottom dollar we have blacklists. You be a drunk ass and that's what goes into the report. And it's the reports that the RDs and OHRL central staff and sometimes the Dean read.\n\nWe know the party rooms. We know what rooms we have to be hardasses to. Please do not become one of those rooms. The best advice I can give is to cooperate as much as possible. Here's how:\n\n1.) Open the door. Seriously. Open the door now. Please. You wait longer than 15 seconds and any RA will know something's up. They'll look and each other and mouth \"Please open the door. Please please just open the fucking door,\" and they'll put on their mean RA faces and get ready to crack down on drunk idiots.\n\nWhat you should do is make a general rule of not having handles of cheap vodka all over the place. Make yourself a drink and put the bottles back in the fridge/on the shelf/under your bed/where ever. (Note: this is just a good rule in life. Put things back where they belong). If/when RAs knock because it's too loud, you can just open the door, and by doing so quickly, almost any RA will not even bother to look inside the room. Even if they suspect you of drinking. Really. Just open the door. It's that simple. Why? Because you're not being obvious and you're making their job easier. They remind you of quiet hours, you turn the music down, you all say goodnight, and that's that. 30 seconds out of everyone's night.\n\nOr the RAs knock, you scramble to the door and then say to the rest of the room \"Shit! It's the RAs!\" (which we totally can't hear on the other side of those sound proof dorm doors), and then you shoo the 20 or so people in the common room into the bedrooms, clink all the bottles around in the process of hiding them, and then answer the door after the RAs have been knocking and hearing all of what's been going on inside the room. Then they have to come in. And they'll have to wait for everyone to come out of the rooms with lame excuses like \"*yawn* oh we were just sleeping.\" Yes, of course. You were just sleeping. With the lights on. Fully dressed. With your shoes on. Standing up. Sounds legit. And then we go through the shpiel of collecting IDs and taking notes and possibly calling Public Safety, which only ever makes things worse (They don't know RA protocol so they usually screw us up, and they come down about 387 times harder on you than your RAs will). And then your lovely RAs have to spend another good hour and a half after they leave your room writing up a report and tracking down all of your personal files. So that's maybe 30 min to an hour of your time and about 3 hours of your RAs time.\n\nIf you cooperate, if you open the door quickly, if, in the event that the RAs come in and ask you if you've been drinking, you do not lie, you bring the alcohol, and you do not pick a fight, those RAs will go out of their way to make sure nothing happens to you. If you make their night hell, they will go out of their way to make sure every other RA in the building knows you're an ass who needs to learn some manners.\n\nGood ideas:\n1.) Don't party in the LB. Go off campus. Or, if you must, hang out in the bedrooms of PRow and Colonial suites.\n\n2.) Go smoke outside. Seriously, the Common and gardens are right there. RIGHT THERE! And they're LOVELY!\n\n3.) RAs are people, too. People who like to have fun and go to parties and throw events using OHRL's money. People like you who just need to pay for college and working for free housing is the only way to do that.\n\n4.) Befriend your RAs. They are some of the greatest people Emerson has to offer. Plus, it means you won't get in trouble nearly as much. Just ask your oh so charming moderator how many times he got busted living next to this gal.\n\nTL;DR: Be good to your RAs and they'll be good to you.",

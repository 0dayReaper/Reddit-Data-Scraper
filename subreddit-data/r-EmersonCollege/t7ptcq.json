This is not a joke, if you\u2019re looking for an idea for a project/thesis film/whatever look no further. \n\nWithout further ado, here\u2019s my pitch:\n\nBasically there\u2019s this super hot dude, like crazy hot. Like so goddam hot that people just faint on the street looking at him. Even people who aren\u2019t attracted to men are like \u201cwoah.\u201d Anyway he\u2019s really hot but that\u2019s not what the story is about. The actual story is about how he\u2019s depressed (even though he\u2019s like super fucking sexy, (like crazy hot)). Basically he wants to die because he doesn\u2019t have any meaningful connections, everyone just wants him for his looks. I\u2019m imagining this slick montage where people are swooning over him on the streets intercut with him crying in the corner of his bedroom screaming. Anyway he meets a blind guy and the two of them start a relationship (keep in mind blind people can\u2019t see how hot he is). Eventually he kisses the blind guy and the kiss is SO HOT that the blind guy learns to see! \n\nThis is just a rough idea, obviously you all can feel to flesh it out. If you do end up making this just give me story credit.",

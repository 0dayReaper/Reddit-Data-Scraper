Last year I was snubbed so I poured my heart into this new project and even though it\u2019s totally awesome I\u2019m still worried it won\u2019t get selected because the judges are totally biased.\n\nIt follows a girl with depression, and it\u2019s filmed in black and white. The black and white is a metaphor for sadness. The reason I\u2019m worried is because the dialogue is incomprehensible for 60% of it because I just used my camera mic and made the background music too loud. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m pretty scared the judges won\u2019t nominate me even though I\u2019m awesome. I literally haven\u2019t been able to sleep for the past weeks because I\u2019m so scared. My grades (which weren\u2019t good to begin with) have taken a nosedive. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions on how to get over this anxiety? Adderall?",

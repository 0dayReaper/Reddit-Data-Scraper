You'll thank yourself later if you try and constructively figure what went wrong and how to fix it, instead of just making yourself feel shitty for feeling shitty. And hey, congratulations! You made it to break!",

I turned it around based on nothing but will power and an extra need to dedicate myself to the material. Passing a college course isn\u2019t a given but anybody can do it if they go about it the right way. Don\u2019t panic. You\u2019re in a great spot. You go to a great school. You are there for a reason. You belong. You know what you need to do. Learn from your mistakes and kick ass next semester. Don\u2019t dwell on these fails, you can\u2019t change the past. And don\u2019t compare your successes/failures to that of others. Everybody at Emerson is on a very personal and individual path.",

You\u2019ll get a course lineup where one prof assigns more work than the other 3 classes combined, it happens. Plenty of resources to pick yourself back up from it and catch up in time to graduate.",

If you don\u2019t have anything positive to contribute, don\u2019t contribute anything. OP is not the only person to ever fail a college class, and not the only person to fail a class at Emerson. They wouldn\u2019t have come to Reddit and expressed their concern if they really didn\u2019t value their education.\n\nWhat I find funny is the fact that you\u2019re seemingly so concerned about money, but you\u2019re using your Emerson degree you spent thousands on to bully college freshmen you don\u2019t know.",

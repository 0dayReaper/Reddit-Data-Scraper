    "postText": "Something that\"s worried me for quite a long time is that when I go to Emerson, the torch that everyone will expect me to carry will extinguish itself. \n\nMy brother's like, big, at least to the right people. It seems like a lot of folks know him, and the legacy he's had while at emerson has to do a lot to do with the technical expertise more than anything, and he was a huge component in the Evvys, and himself was nominated more than once.\n\nI'm not him. I'm not a techie, nor am I comfortable with that kind of work. I am most comfortable on a stage, not in front of a computer. I'm worried that if I apply, the expectation will he that I'll just be..him. \n\nI don't want to be known as his sister. I want to be known by the name I carve for myself. \n\nIs this one of those colleges that believe that specific talents run through bloodlines or will I have a start of my own?\n\nEdited for clarity.",

And anybody that can't get past what they expect of you to just let you be you can screw themselves. It's not like the college can force you into that track, only you get to decide what program you join. Don't let anyone else make that decision for you. \nYou're an individual, you don't have to carry the torch of his legacy, make your own legacy.",

Rarely do people ask for your last name, and even if they do, it's even more rare they will connect the dots of relation. You said you and your brother were not into the same things, so that's distancing yourself even further. \n\nCollege is a time where a lot of people reinvent themselves into who they want to be, and there is no other you in the world. Find your tribe, be friendly. You'll do just fine! Besides, you are there for school, not them!",

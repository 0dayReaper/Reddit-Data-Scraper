Even if they have an identical twin that goes to some other college, and will never be on Emerson's campus, they'll share it with the class. Or, if they want to be an actor but chose to be a Media Arts major, they'll tell you all about it. If they're from another country, they'll start every story with \"Well, I know that in Canada...\"",

They're all trying to network, trying to outshine you, trying to intimidate you, as much as they're pretending they're not.\n\nBut in the same grain I think we're all a friendly bunch. Don't be afraid to talk to people. Get involved on campus. I don't mean just apply for organizations - actually *go* to events. \n\nThis school is a \"choose your own adventure\" kind of place. You could sit here for four years idly, going to classes, thinking they're easy, and then be lost once you graduate. Or you could apply yourself. I learned this one year into the game, but oh well.\n\nPS: You also meet the best people in Allston.",

As other people in this thread have said, I met a lot of my friends through my floor last year. Unfortunately, as a transfer student living off-campus, that's not an option for you. My advice: just start talking to people. I think Emersonians want to be friendly, but many of us just need to be poked and prodded a bit. Also, my best friend is back with his girlfriend, so if any of you ever want to hang out, hit me up. I have a lot of free time :3",

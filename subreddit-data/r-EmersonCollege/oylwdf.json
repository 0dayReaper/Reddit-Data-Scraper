    "postText": "I wanted to leave a message for people who are considering Emerson, or who are new students at Emerson. My intended audience is primarily people with mental health issues, in addition to people who have dealt with abuse or who are especially at risk for it (i.e. women and enby folks, though men are absolutely also victims of abuse). What I have to say is pretty negative, and TW for SA and suicidal ideation.\n\nEmerson does not actually care about students' well being. Like, at all.\n\nI was suicidal and briefly admitted inpatient, and as soon as I got out the school's response was to tell me the \"community\" would be better off without me and I either had to leave or do a 8 hour a day out patient program, during my classes, for several weeks (that the inpatient program had recommended, but said they were fine with me not doing it) while still having to make up every single class I missed. Obviously that's basically impossible to do with a full course load. I eventually didn't have to do it because I threatened to sue (despite not having the money) because I'm 90% sure what they were doing wasn't legal. Even then they made me sign this long list of requirements for staying at Emerson, including that I *wasn't allowed to talk to Emerson students about my depression*. Basically, I wasn't allowed to have close friends. I had also previously used Emerson resources during (wholly nonviolent) panic attacks and this was used against me as evidence that I was bad for the community. (Related, on one of these occasions I was nonverbal as a result of a panic attack and the RD told me if I didn't talk to him he would call an ambulance on me, essentially threatening hospital costs to ensure compliance. I'm not the only person who was threatened with this due to nonviolent panic attacks)\n\nThe next semester, I'd been through so much with Emerson that I decided to get my cat registered as an ESA and take her to school. They did everything in their power to delay the process. They saw a genuine ESA letter and told me they didn't think I'd been seeing my psychiatrist long enough and I needed another letter from my therapist. They interrogated me on exactly what my mental health issues were and exactly why I needed an ESA, so *they* could determine whether I actually needed one. Legally, if you have an ESA letter, your ESA is guaranteed housing unless it can be proven burdensome (like if I was trying to take a horse as my ESA to a 15th floor dormroom). It isn't your landlord's job to determine if you're *really* depressed. I think they knew this and were planning on eventually approving it (because otherwise what they were doing would've been illegal), but wanted the process to take as long as possible so the semester would start before she was fully approved, and I would have to wait another semester to take her. I was eventually able to get her approved two days before driving to Boston, but it was close.\n\nIn that last semester I was also coming to terms with the fact that a former partner had r**** me. In addition to being generally unhelpful, the school continually took his side, with the representative telling me \"oh he's going through a really tough time right now\" to influence me. He got a No Contact Order against me (something you don't need any evidence to do, you can just get it against whoever, he wasn't allowed to contact me either), then reported me to the school saying that because I contacted his girlfriend telling her he's a r*****, I violated the No Contact Order. Rather than looking at the report and saying \"even if this is true it's not a violation,\" the school decided to send me a vague, ominous email saying that I was being investigated for disciplinary violations occurring on X date, and if I didn't schedule a hearing by the end of the week I would face consequences. Had a panic attack, missed my classes, and finally got around to my hearing. Within the first two minutes, I was told they found me not guilty of any violations and I'd done nothing wrong, but could I pretty please just not contact my rapist's girlfriend or friends, because it makes him sad. When I later complained that this was a misogynistic, disgusting way of handling it (as it essentially treated this man's girlfriend as an extension of himself), I was told that they had to investigate it (despite no real investigation happening, just them scaring me, then telling me I wasn't in trouble, then telling me to consider his feelings) and what I was saying had no validity. After this I lost all faith in their ability to investigate, and stopped trying to get an investigation into my ex's actions. After that semester I dropped out because I couldn't stand to be in a place that had mistreated me to that degree.\n\nI thought the \"Emerson community\" was pretty much nonexistent, and a lot of the liberalism in the student body was performative. For instance, after I came forward about being r**** by my ex, not a single man in our old friend group kept talking to me (not surprisingly, every woman I told did believe me, wonder why that is /s), presumably assuming I was lying. VMA dudebro culture is very much a thing and the men I knew in the program were liberal publicly, but unwilling to accept as valid feminist criticisms of the straight white male directors they liked, and unwilling to hold each other accountable for SA. Granted, I didn't know every single VMA, so it could just be that I met a bad bunch. Same thing about the community \u2013 I'm sure there are genuinely lovely communities at Emerson, but don't take a group being vocally liberal as meaning that they would actually support you in the event of SA. \n\nNow, other than these things my experience at Emerson was fine. I loved my professors and thought I was getting a good education, except when I was in so much distress from the school's handling of issues that I couldn't learn. I think I gained a lot of knowledge about my field (journalism). But I don't think good academics were enough to make up for Emerson's treatment of mental health and SA issues.\n\nIf you're a student at Emerson, my advice is to not lean on the school for help. They pretend to care, but they will use it against you if they decide you're a liability because of mental health problems. Pick your friends carefully, and make sure you surround yourself with people who have proven that they would support you or anyone else who was the victim of SA or any other form of abuse or violence. At Emerson, abusers wrap themselves in claims of liberalism and openness, so be very careful of other red flags because, chances are, they will pretend to be an ally. Ultimately you will probably need to take care of yourself, because unfortunately, the school will likely do nothing unless you have overwhelming proof (which is difficult to have for many cases of SA). Emerson is, at the end of the day, a business, and it's not good for business to alienate r******.\n\nTLDR: Emerson's administration repeatedly displayed a lack of care for my mental well being and lack of interest in justice for SA victims like me. If you go to Emerson, be very careful about your interactions with the administration because they don't care about you.",

I think there's pretty low institutional expectations across the board and it really begs the question of where those astronomical tuition payments are going.\n\nhttps://berkeleybeacon.com/emersons-mental-health-resources-need-improvement/",

            "comment": "TW: suicidal ideation\n\nThis was my experience as well, especially when living on campus. I had a period of major depression my second semester freshmen year which culminated in suicidal ideation and the start of an attempt which I was luckily able to stop. An RD came to my room and tried to coerce me into going to the hospital, which I refused and was able to seem calm enough until she left. I was then made to go to a mandatory therapy session with the director of psych services, whose response to my history of mental illness and therapy was that I \u201cmight be depressed\u201d and that I should go on meds as soon as possible. The next year I tried going to the same center to find an outside therapist they could refer me to that took my insurance. They gave me four names who apparently took my insurance and were currently accepting patients, but when I called only one was taking new patients and when I had an intake with her I found she actually did not take my insurance and charged me $300 for the intake. \n\nObviously not nearly as intense as what you went through, but even my brief experiences with the schools mental health services did not inspire any confidence in me. I was able to find a therapist in JP after moving off campus and never let the school find out about other depressive periods I was having out of fear of how it would be perceived by administration. It\u2019s very clear they do not prioritize students mental health and well being.",

    "postText": "Hello! I was accepted into Emerson via the Media Program program, and Im still deciding between Emerson and another school. I've seen a lot of the praise for the program, but I want to know what students in the program think of it.\n\nSo, to any media production majors, why did you choose Emerson? Was it your first choice? Does it match your expectations? Are there any reasons one might not want to go there?",

            "comment": "hi \nI transferred to Emerson Fall 2021 and will be graduating May 2024 (so been here for 2 full years)!\n\nEmerson was one of my top choices along w Ithaca College (in NY). It definitely was more than what I expected in means of there\u2019s a lot of people in the program therefore there\u2019s a lot of projects you can work on with the 4 main film/ tv orgs. I honestly didn\u2019t come in with a lot of thought other than the Mafia.\n\nMy main reason for committing to Emerson was because of the alumni network and high chances of getting a job out of college. I also was looking for a more city life than a typical college campus.\n\nOkay now to the honest stuff. As much as the program does offer things it\u2019s also quite limiting\n- Classes are small and maybe offer 2-3 sections therefore it\u2019s competitive to get into classes/professors you want\n- Emerson projects/films are interesting in which every single project selects a crew through interviews (they\u2019re usually pretty casual), but there\u2019s often nepotism and also Emerson kids only want to hire people with \u201cEmerson\u201d experience (even if you have real-world experience in the field). For some reason, Emerson people think that Emerson experience is more valuable?\n- Some of the leading to orgs/film projects can be sort of cliquey if you surround yourself in that environment\n- If you\u2019re looking to get studio (tv) experience it\u2019s pretty limited, Emerson only offers 1 studio class. And as much as I love the Emerson Channel (the Tv org on campus), it\u2019s very much a learning org. The actual content that is produced/ finished in the end isn\u2019t the most visually pleasing. But love the org because it allows you the opportunity to learn new positions/roles.\n- Getting equipment is also limited. Emerson has some cool/expensive equipment but you\u2019re only granted access to whatever production class you\u2019re enrolled in. So if you\u2019re not enrolled in any, you can\u2019t rent equipment out (unless you do so through a film project that\u2019s associated with a film organization) or if you\u2019re taking the first-year production class you have access to like 5-10 pieces of equipment.\n-   Some productions classes require you to pay for materials (ie. Film rolls, batteries, etc.)\n- The work culture is kinda of crazy in a way that no one teaches anyone about work-life balance. Most people take on too many projects (and often are influenced to) which leads to affecting mental health and ability to work on school and finish their work. \n\nThese are just some of my thoughts. But I do think Emerson offers a large pool of projects you can work on. Overall, you only get on projects and rack up a portfolio if YOU make the effort to. Like any other school, you also make the path of how you want your experience to be. So surround yourself with the people you want in your life.",

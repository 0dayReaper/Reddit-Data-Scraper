I have found very mixed opinions about Emerson's financial aid but I wanted to try and ask for anyone's experience with it in regards to their Global BFA programs?",

I just have to contact them one by one to get everything sorted out :\u2019) they\u2019re all looking for custodial parent or household-b income but it simply doesn\u2019t exist lol.",

    "postText": "Hi all, incoming graduate student here, 23 F if it matters, POC, I am stressfully planning my move to Boston, hopefully sometime this summer. Since I will be very new to Boston, I'm hoping to gain some insight from Emerson students. What are the \"best\" nearby neighborhoods to live in in Boston? I know no one place is perfect, and each person has a different experience but I only have the internet to rely on at this point to help find a good area to live in, and I have read a lot of contradicting things. I can't really afford more than $1000 for myself, I plan to have at least 1 roommate, probably more likely to have 2 &amp; I have seen like 2 or 3 apartments (2+ beds) in North End and Beacon Hill around that price for 1 bed. However, I have heard better things in terms of what I'm ideally looking for (diversity, affordability, safety) in Jamaica Plain, Mission Hill, Brookline even Allston/Brighton. My issue is that these places are a little too far away from where I would rather be. I anticipate having to be closer to campus more often due to my area of study and I don't want to have to worry about traveling longer distances if I can help it, especially since I will be taking transit or biking. I know I will have to probably sacrifice one or two of my ideal preferences but in terms of proximity to campus, safety and price, what neighborhoods closer to Emerson could I consider? Or help me face facts, even -- If I have to travel the distance in order to find the place I want, I would like to know that too. Any suggestions to finding good housing/good neighborhood is much appreciated!",

However, not many people live in Eastie but many were starting to move there. \n\nYou'll find a lot of people living in Allston. Its cheap and a lot of housing. I would suggest Somerville/something on the red line.",

If I were you I would stick with beacon hill - easy walk to campus, with roommates in budget, lots to do on Charles st and close by. Don\u2019t underestimate the value of a short commute. When I was at Emerson I had friends out in JP and it\u2019s a real shlep. Don\u2019t do it!",

            "comment": "There's some great advice on this thread, and I would also like to add Dorchester to the list of possible neighborhoods, especially between the UMass and Savin Hill stops on the red line. I lived in that area, a five minute walk from Dot Ave which had some good food options and your on the south side of the red line, so less likely to see delays. Overall commute to campus was about the same as you'd have living in Allston but I personally liked to stay off the green line, as it's way more likely to delay than the red line. Dorchester has a less than stellar reputation but it's changing and the area I was in was mostly grad students and families, so it was very chill. I lived in a three bedroom with roommates and we each paid less than $1000 per month.",

Currently in an apartment right in Chinatown so it only takes me 3 min to get to my classes.\n\nI'd say for diversity Allston, though it is a bit of a hassle to get to campus (and who knows with the T always being renovated!) I love being in Chinatown and the food options are great, though it isn't always the safest neighborhood at night.",

It's fine during normal dining hours say until about 10pm? Mostly lots of drunk people at night, but if you're in a group and steer clear of them you'll be fine. \n\nIf budget is not a problem I think Chinatown and Downtown Crossing is a great choice because of convenience, it was the reason I moved!",

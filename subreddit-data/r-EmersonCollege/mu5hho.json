Idk if it\u2019s because I\u2019m in for the spring semester but there absolutely no way my family can afford this (have a brother already in college). If I even take the time to appeal this it\u2019s there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to match what Loyola Maryland is offering. Does anyone know if the awards are different for spring semester students?",

If you're in need, and have already submitted the FAFSA and your EFC to the college, I can't think of many reasons why you'd receive an aid award of 0 dollars. I'd at *least* expect a baseline offer of like, 500 dollars or something, even if you had a full EFC.",

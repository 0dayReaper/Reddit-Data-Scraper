            "comment": "Communications is very broad but media jobs pay squat. If you are going into six figures of debt to take an entry level job at 35k, it is going to be nearly impossible to repay the debt and live a some what normal life. \nIf you want to go to Emerson I would transfer in. Get your gen-eds out of the way which will save you a ton of money. \nMy issue with Emerson is that it is based in Boston. Boston is a great town (especially as a college kid) but the Boston market is too small and there isn\u2019t a lot of networking opportunities to make IN Boston. \nI enjoyed my time at Emerson and it prepared me to work in my field but if you work in media not being in the action puts you back a step, and the debt of college is no joke.",

            "comment": "The people in all these threads are miserable. They probably took out too much in loans, and then they couldn't figure out how to get a job. I was able to finance my education while taking out a relatively small amount of loans, and I'm graduating with some solid job prospects. That's because I worked my butt off to get good grades and do internships. And honestly, even in something less traditional like the entertainment industry, a lot of folks I've talked to admit that a Bachelors makes things easier.\n\nFigure out what you can afford. Talk with the Financial Aid office. Then, if you can afford it and you think it's a good fit,, work hard at Emerson. Don't be a miserable Redditor.",

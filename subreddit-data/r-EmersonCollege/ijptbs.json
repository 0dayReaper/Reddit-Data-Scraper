    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, and I saw this thread on Twitter today: https://twitter.com/Morgan_Harris17/status/1299731112332230656?s=20.  I knew coming into college that there would be some uptight / self-righteous students, especially at a liberal arts school in the middle of the BLM movement.  This post really blew me out of the water.  Did I sign up for a campus full of loud \"sistas\" that are going to go ballistic every time a white man says something they don't like?  The comments are infuriating too, saying 6 books a semester is unreasonable.  Do these people even know how to read coming into one of the best art schools in the country?  Or do they expect to cruise through shouting \"rayciss\" every time they get an F and flaring their noses until it's raised to a B?\n\nI'm not a hateful person, but this really ticked me off.  What gives?",

Part of that is, if they believe that there is an issue, they will not be quiet about it, but be very clear in how they feel about the issue. If you're going to stay at Emerson, you're going to run into a lot of people who will not sit quiet while there is an issue they care about. \n\nI will also say, if you're going to stay at Emerson, you're going to want to look at what you're saying and examine it, because saying things like\n\n&gt; Or do they expect to cruise through shouting \"rayciss\" every time they get an F and flaring their noses until it's raised to a B?\n\nis not only actually very rude, but also not what's happening here. And if you're going to make comments like that at Emerson, people are going to call you out on it. Emerson is a place that will make you think about a lot of issues you hadn't considered, and it's a wonderful chance to educate yourself and become a much more informed person.\n\nAlso, on a side note, I'm not sure exactly what spelling it \"rayciss\" is supposed to achieve, and I would encourage you to examine what effect you were attempting to have with it.",

Using phrases like \"chimping out\" is incredibly offensive (directly comparing black people to apes, which has a long history), and describing how an entire group talks as incorrect is not only not accurate, but also carries a huge amount of subtext around ideas of Black Americans being less educated and not speaking properly. Even the idea of someone being \"uppity\" has a troublesome history, especially when applied to black people. People at Emerson care about these issues and won't let them lie when they come up. I would encourage you to take some time and look into the mindset with which you are approaching these matters.",

Your take is a gross over simplification, and shows a deep lack of understanding of both how the Emerson experience actually is, and the lives of your peers.\n\n6 books a semester isn't only outrageous based on the average work load in these classes, you'll learn what I mean soon enough, but it's also massively expensive.\n\nAlso, \n\n&gt;Did I sign up for a campus full of loud \"sistas\" that are going to go ballistic every time a white man says something they don't like? \n\n&gt;do they expect to cruise through shouting \"rayciss\" every time they get an F and flaring their noses until it's raised to a B?\n\n&gt;I'm not a hateful person\n\nThese comments all paint different pictures.",

Any time you make a statement like that and qualify it with \"but,\" you are, in fact, that thing you're saying you're not. Also, \"uppity\" is a term historically used by racists when dealing with black people who speak their mind. My advice to you? Open your mind and get a grip on yourself. Representation is important, and the person who complained has every right to do so. You are coming off as not only rude, but extremely racist yourself, and not at all representative of Emerson's values. And I say this as a white cis male graduate of the program.",

These are classes not only offered at a school like Emerson, you will see similar coursework at plenty of top-tier colleges around the nation. I really hope you can learn and grow at Emerson.

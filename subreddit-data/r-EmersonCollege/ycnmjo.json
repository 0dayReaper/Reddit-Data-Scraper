Who are some of the good / bad professors and why?\nFor whatever strange reason, I\u2019ve noticed that people will talk shit about professors, but won\u2019t name names. How am I supposed to avoid them? I am most interested in the good ones.",

Inexperienced and does a poor job teaching students about the Bolex. Hard Class. \n\nVM 403 - Professor Whetsell (standup comedy). Poor lesson plans and a video-heavy curriculum which makes it boring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Good:\n\nVM 241 - Professor Moreno (studio TV production). Best professor I've had at emerson. Extremely knowledgeable about the industry and is seasoned in her field. Learned so much from her.\n\nVM 402 - Professor S. Wang (diasporic cinema). Very kind, passionate about the subject, and paces her assignments very well.",

            "comment": "The typical film student schedule obviously depends on the year but there are specific requirements for the major. The way it typically works is as follows. Freshman year you take the following:\n\n* Intro to College Writing\n* Research Writing\n* History of Media Arts (basically film history)\n* Foundations in Media Arts Production (your first production class)\n* Misc general education courses to fill liberal arts requirements\n\nSophomore year you take the following:\n\n* Media Criticism &amp; Theory (media studies course)\n* Intro Screenwriting Course of your choosing\n* 2 Intro Level Production Courses of your choosing (for example, Film I, Intro to Narrative Drama, Intro to Studio TV, etc.)\n* Misc general education courses to fill liberal arts requirements\n\nJunior and senior years you take the following:\n\n* 2 (I think it's 2, might be 1) Upper Level Media Studies Courses of your choosing\n* 1 Upper Level Media \"Seminar\" Course of your choosing\n* At LEAST 2 Advanced Production Courses of your choosing (as you may assume, most people take a bunch of production courses since that's what they're most interested in)\n* 2 Upper Level Liberal Arts Courses of your choosing\n* Remainder of general education requirements\n\nAs Throw72away said below, most courses aren't too intensive. Any literature class will require quite a bit of reading. Your freshman and sophomore year courses will probably be the most intense for reading, as History of Media Arts and Media Criticism and Theory require reading a lot of material. Some professors, as with any college, take themselves a bit too seriously and give waaaaaay too much work, so always read reviews. \n\nAs Throw72Away said again, a big part of Emerson is the co-curricular activities. Most students are able to involve themselves in a lot of co-curricular activities to learn even more and gain valuable experience - working on film sets, producing TV shows, etc. Because of the flexibility of the major (see above how many courses are OF YOUR CHOOSING) and how many different courses and course times are available, Emerson tries to let you make your schedule the way you want it.",

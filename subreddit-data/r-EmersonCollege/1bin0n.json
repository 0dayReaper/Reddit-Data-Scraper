I'm graduated this May and already have a job, but I feel like I have succeeded despite my Emerson degree. I'm grateful to Emerson for the functions it performed as a platform for my growth, but as an institution it didn't provide any more value than a state school or community college.\n\nThe classes at Emerson are not challenging. If you're looking to be exposed to a wide variety of texts or concepts in the liberal arts (literature, philosophy, psych, sociology, history, etc.) you're not going to find happiness here. The classes I took as an honors VMA major had paltry reading lists, and many of them used the same few texts.\n\nIf you want to be a ~famous entertainer~ or if you want to be involved in film or tv production, Emerson may be a smart move for you. I've heard marketing and communication sciences/disorders are also good programs, but I can't speak to that. Don't come here for any new-media-related pursuits (animation, programming, design), and don't come here for a solid liberal arts foundation.  Emerson makes a lot of promises and delivers on very few.\n\nTL; DR: Yes.",

I don't feel like I've learned enough to go out and get a job after I graduate.\n\nI also feel like it's very difficult to make friends here. Basically the only way I've seen to get to know people is through extracurriculars, but those are either so exclusive to certain majors or specific in the kind of people that they're willing to accept that it's taken me three years to finally make any actual friends here.\n\nI feel very nervous in my major courses because everyone in them is already far more experienced than I am. I fear that I won't be able to compete when I leave.\n\n**TLDR- yes, I feel regret for coming here at least once every few weeks, and that feeling lingers for several days at a time.**",

It's hard enough living on campus but like you said, the EC's are all late at night and that's not really an option for me because I commute too far to hang around till 10 ish at night. But I mean that being said, I dont feel like I regret coming here. I just think they, as a school, could handle some things a bit differently to accommodate people who aren't around as much as those who live in the school and those that feel like maybe they aren't up to everyone else's level.

I also feel like I'm not good enough because I'm a transfer student and people have been studying in my program for longer than I have.  But overall I'm glad I decided to come.  It's a really great school and I'm getting an education that's perfectly matches my interests and the way I learn in general.",

I tend to be pretty forward, and I am super active in the theatre scene, have a lot of people that I consider good friends, and have learned a lot. But I undoubtedly have learned the most from what I actively pursued. \n\nThe GenEds are not super challenging, no. But I have learned SO much since I've been here, from my theatre classes and from my extracurriculars (which are definitely more my focus), and I do not and have never regretted coming here. ",

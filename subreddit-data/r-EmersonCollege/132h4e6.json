    "postText": "Hiiii - so my dad works at Emerson and I recently graduated from NESL right down the street! I have a video/marketing project I need help with and he said to \u2018make a flyer and [he\u2019ll] post it on a board\u2019 not sure what he meant by that but should I even bother? Is there even a \u2018board\u2019? If there is a board, will people offer (for pay) to assist with filming??? Just trying to get a feel for the culture of these \u2018boards\u2019 and see if I should put all my eggs in that basket. Tysm in advance!!",

The semester is almost over, but there are people sticking around an extra week for the EVVY\u2019s.  If you\u2019re looking for help then, that might be a good time to find some available VMA students.",

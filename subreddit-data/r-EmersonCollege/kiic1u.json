    "postText": "Now that EA/ED results are out for the class of 2025, it's the perfect time to shill our Discord server here! This invite isn't limited to incoming freshmen either - feel free to join if you're a current undergrad, graduate student, or alum. Especially during times of Zoom U where it's hard to make new friends, our server offers an opportunity for remote and on campus students alike to socialise safely. It's a group to kick back, chat, commiserate, post memes, and play games with other students. We've been going strong for 2.5 years now and we have a few hundred members. \n\n[Click here to join!](https://discord.gg/RR5X9FS)",

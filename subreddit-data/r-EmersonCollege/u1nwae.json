    "postText": "I initially applied to Emerson because I liked what they offered, and planned on committing if financial aid would allow me to. But reading old posts on this subreddit criticizing the institution is making me reconsider if I should really attend. I've been admitted as a WLP major and have a heavy interest in literary academia and gender/women's studies--I actually did my senior mini-thesis on these two topics and it made me realize I'd like to study English at a more deeper level. I haven't really thought about my plans career-wise--I've struggled with mental health for a long time and only started professional help the start of senior year. I haven't really had the emotional availability to think about concrete goals. All I know is what I'm passionate about, and I have thought attending Emerson would really help my passions for literature and writing flourish. The thing is, I'm worried that I'll want to change career paths to something more financially stable and this school wouldn't be able to help unless I transfer out. I also haven't received my financial aid package yet, and I'm not sure if this is a red flag or not because everyone else in my friend group already received their financial aid info from all of their admitted colleges. \n\nIs Emerson College a right choice for me? I guess I just want to know what Emerson is like from the perspectives of those that are already attending there, especially if they're applying as a WLP major as well. I'd also like to know how easy it would be to transfer out of Emerson College (if need be), as well as career options once you graduate. I've also heard it's hard to succeed at Emerson if you're not a Type A person, which intimidates me as someone who's naturally pretty introverted and soft-spoken. \n\nAll of this reads like a ramble so I apologize for the lack of organization in this post.",

Emerson was absolutely worth it to me.\n\nBut I've been graduated 6 years, and damn, the student loans hurt. \n\nIf you have uncertainty than please find a community college in your area and get an associates degree, transfer into Emerson in 2 years. If I could go back, that exactly what I would have done.\n\nYes go to Emerson, I think it is an amazing institution, but it sounds like you're, rightly, questioning your future. Please consider if you can get started at a school that's less than 50,000 a year.",

It might sound cool to live in Boston, with it\u2019s historical roots, gorgeous red-brick buildings, and endless rows of skyscrapers\u2014but it\u2019s not. The aesthetic is so not worth it, trust me.",

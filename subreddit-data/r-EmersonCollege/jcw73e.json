            "comment": "Emerson VMA freshman here. The general consensus among the community is that financial aid at Emerson can be pretty stingy. To put costs into perspective, the Global BFA is less in terms of cost (about $60k total, $32k tuition, $18k room, and $10k other expenses) compared to the Boston campus ($76k total lmfao). Your best bet would be scholarships, since you can\u2019t apply for the honors college (which knocks about $26k off your cost of attendance). I know a few folks in the global BFA program, so I\u2019ll follow up once I hear back from them.",

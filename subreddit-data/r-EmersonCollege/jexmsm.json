    "postText": "I am planning on taking a 300-level course in U.S Diversity for my Liberal Arts requirement. I want to take a 300 level course so I can double-dip in my major requirement of taking 2 advanced (300 or 400) Liberal Arts courses. I don't want anything too difficult, but obviously, I don't expect to take a 300 course that acts like a 100 course. Just something that will be easier to pass. It's especially important cause I plan on taking 5 courses in the Spring. The rest of the courses I'd plan on taking would be intro courses, 100 or 200 level. I was looking into either PS306 Psychology of Prejudice or IN327 REEL: Race In and Out of Hollywood. Let me know what you guys think, I would really appreciate it.",

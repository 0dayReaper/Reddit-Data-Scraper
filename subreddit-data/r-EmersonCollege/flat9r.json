    "postText": "Hey guys, I need some help!\n\nSo, I've been accepted to attend Emerson college's spring semester next year and I'm committing to that. However, I need to do something for the fall term. Does anyone know if it's possible to attend universities for one semester or if some colleges offer 1 semester-long courses? Also, I've been added to the fall waitlist, any idea about what can I do to improve my chances of getting in for the fall term?",

I took a number of college courses during High School (dual enrollment) and they all transferred in for credits (though only one filled a degree requirement.)\n\nThe big recommendation I have is to see if you can find any gen ed courses you'd most likely be bored with (like Public Speaking, Literature, Social/Psych, etc.) and if everything lines up, take those. This would free up more space for electives during your time at Emerson.",

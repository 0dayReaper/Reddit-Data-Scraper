    "postText": "I have heard that some colleges &amp; universities have a preference of SAT or ACT scores in admissions and I was wondering if Emerson did?\nI\u2019m a Junior (F16) and recently took the SAT and ACT (my first for both) and I planned on continuing to prep for the one I did better on, but I did reasonably good on both. I was told I should focus on what my dream school seems to prefer but I couldn\u2019t find anything about Emerson having a preference\n\n(I scored a 1140 on SAT, 25 on ACT \u2014 if you have any recommendations of which one to focus on considering the two scores I\u2019d happily take the advice too!  I got 630 English and 510 Math for my SAT, and for ACT I got 30 Reading, 23 Math, 23 English, 24 Science)\n\nThank you so much!",

First they superscore so maybe focus on Math the next go around no matter which you choose to submit. Second with the SAT you need a minimum 560 in Math to test out of the requirement. Since it seems almost all creatives are slightly math deficient that\u2019s what my son did so he would never have to take another math class in school again!",

Think about who'd fit best on a college dorm bed and still give you ample sleeping space.\n- Swap out stuffies every time you come home between semesters! At least, if this is something you can do. No one's staying in my house as I'm the last kid to go off to college and they're eager to get out of here, but they said they're willing to bring some of my belongings with them if need be.\n-  Hope your roommate isn't a jerk and lets you live your life. If you can find one with a similar interest, maybe it's something to ask them!\n\nMy expert partner isn't awake to clarify how she went about the problem, but I'll update the post if she provides any additional insight. Legitimately hope this helped!",

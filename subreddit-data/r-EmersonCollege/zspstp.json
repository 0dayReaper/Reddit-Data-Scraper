    "postText": "I\u2019m about to enter the final semester of my senior year at college. I\u2019m currently a Psychology and Professional Writing major, and my current GPA after this semester is 3.60. I\u2019m also about to do two writing related internships next semester. I\u2019m extremely interested in the online Popular Fiction and Publishing MFA, but as I\u2019m an anxious person, I want to prepare myself mentally. So I have a few questions if anyone is willing to answer!\n\n1. How difficult is it to get into this specific program? With my current GPA and two internships about to be under my belt, do you think I would have a chance at getting in? I also plan on applying before the priority decision date.\n\n2. Would anyone be able to tell me their experiences with this program overall? How were the classes? How were the professors? Did it feel more disconnected being 100% online?\n\n3. Something very important to me is diversity and acceptance, so how would you say that is within the program? I intend on writing books with lgbtq+ characters, so this may sound silly but I just want to make sure that this is a safe space for me and my writing :)\n\n4. Lastly, how are the connections and networking? This kind of ties back to whether it felt disconnected being online.  I think that a big part of writing is being able to introduce yourself to other writers and types of writing. \n\nSorry if any of these questions seem silly but if anyone has any answers I would be so appreciative!",

With a 3.6 GPA, I'd say your chances of getting in are pretty good. \n2. There were several professors that were absolutely top notch for me. John Rodzvilla and Jon Papernick, to name a few, were very supportive. I didn't feel disconnected at all because we had weekly discussions and the online course was what I wanted. The classes were challenging and valuable, especially the ones on marketing your book and book design. \n3. Emerson prides (see what I did there?) itself on its diversity and acceptance. I'm part of the lbgtqia+ community, and we embraced all diversity in the program. \n4. The connections and networking thing... You'll have to put some effort into keeping the relationships you form in the program, but that's the same with anywhere, in person or online. \n\nIf you have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer them.",

I\u2019ll definitely do my best to get in, and I\u2019ll definitely be reaching out in the future (hopefully with good news). Thanks so much!",

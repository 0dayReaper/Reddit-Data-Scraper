    "postText": "I've spent 2 hours calling offices across Boston. Amounting to 10 hours total across the last 4 months. I'm sick of it. Nobody will accept me as a patient for months now, and none will accept my vials that I already have in my hometown.\n\nDoes anyone here have any suggestions on what to do? BU doesn't administer the shots so I have to find a practice outside the school. \n\nHow do yall get your shots?\n\nI can't administer them on my own since my hometown practice won't release my vials because of the histamine reaction risk, but they're super easy to administer.",

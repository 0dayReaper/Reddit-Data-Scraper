Boston's a great city to walk around and having a quality umbrella is a big help. Similarly, a good pair of winter boots. It's super fun to go out in the snow but it's less fun to have wet socks and slip all the time walking to class. You don't really have to worry about it fall semester, but the start of spring semester tends to be pretty snowy (or in the case of my freshman year, massive amounts of snow that basically shut down school for a month).",

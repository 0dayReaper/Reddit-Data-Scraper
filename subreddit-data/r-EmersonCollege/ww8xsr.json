    "postText": "i'm a highschool senior from the boston area and emerson is seriously my dream school ( just finished reading through a bunch of the pro/con posts on this sub and tbh it's still worth it to me). i've been working on my application for quite awhile and am planning to apply early decision for fall 2023 admission and i would like to go for a creative writing major. i have some pretty notable credentials on my application, but covid gave me a few hiccups in terms of grades in two classes (never failed a class, grades were just about twenty points lower than i would've liked. i still have a high gpa and am in nhs, but these classes are a major stressor on my application).\n\nthese two classes (sophomore year integrated math and junior year spanish 2) really have me worried about my chances of getting in, so i was wondering if any past early decision students could tell me about how well they believe ed increased their chances so i can have some assurance. my cousin also went to emerson, so if anyone has info on how well that would help, i would love to know.\n\ni really feel something special with this school and would love to have it be the next step i take in life, but the acceptance rate has me very anxious so i would really like to know how well anyone thinks ed and familial relations could increase my chances. just to ease some of my worries. this is a hefty process lol. thanks!",

Go for it!\n\nAs for your grades, don't stress them too much. As you said, you have a high GPA, and your application has some impressive credentials. It's your essays and portfolio that will ultimately set you apart from other applicants.\n\nI was a homeschooler. I didn't have a GPA sanctioned by my town's school district. However, what I could bring to the table were experiences I felt resonated with Emerson's philosophy of creativity and discovery, as well as a drive to further my passions.\n\nEmerson is an art school. Talk about what your art means to you and how you'll thrive.\n\nWishing you all the best! I'm sure you'll do great.",

I got a pretty good GPA and good test scores but i def had some hiccups during covid (in the math department as well lol). i applied early action and i think it really helped me to get in. so i think early decision would help a lot if you\u2019re really committed to emerson.",

    "postText": "So I was admitted as a Spring 2021 student and was put on the waitlist for Fall 2020. My admission portal had the \"Congrats\" and everything and the official admission letter for spring 2021 students and had the deposit there and everything. I got a call about 4 days ago from Mike Brosseau saying if I was interested in moving from Spring 2021 to Fall 2020 since Emerson was assessing the possibility of moving students. Of course, I said I was interested. Then today I logged into my admission portal like the anxious person I am and it looked the same as I described it in the beginning, but then my page reloaded and everything was gone. The only thing there was the \"Status Update\" from March 16, 2020. Since my Spring congrats is gone, does it mean they're moving me to fall? \n\nSorry I'm just really anxious because it is May 1st haha.\n\nEDIT: I got off the waitlist!!",

Sometime around late April, I got a call from an Admissions Office person and they asked if I wanted to move to Fall so I said yes. And on May 1st they told me I got off the waitlist. It wasn't really ASAP it took a couple of days",

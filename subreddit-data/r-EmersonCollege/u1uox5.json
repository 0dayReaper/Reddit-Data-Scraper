    "postText": "Hi everyone ! I\u2019m currently having a very hard time deciding between Emerson and the University of Utah. They\u2019re both extremely different, I know! \n\nFor reference, I was also accepted into syracuse (s.i. Newhouse), which I was totally stoked about until I saw the price. I\u2019m fully aware that emerson isn\u2019t a whole lot better, but they did give me a scholarship and then some when I filed for more aid\u2026 As of right now, I\u2019m ruling syracuse out. I just don\u2019t think I can justify the price.\n\nSo, why utah? It\u2019s very cheap in comparison to literally anywhere else for me, I would have virtually zero dollars in debt if I went there. Completely different vibe though, and no PR major (just communication studies). I visited recently and it\u2019s beautiful- seems like a really good time! But I know it wouldn\u2019t offer me the opportunities that emerson can, especially in terms of the alumni network.\n\nBasically, like everybody else, I\u2019m wondering if emerson is worth it. I\u2019ve read tons of comments and posts on this page that are real critical of the place, but I\u2019m just not sure. I also haven\u2019t seen a thing about the PR major, so if anyone has anything on that I would really appreciate the info.",

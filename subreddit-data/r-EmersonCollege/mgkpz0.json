You may be able to build your grades up for a better financial package as well. It\u2019s not worth that much debt. You\u2019ll be entering a field with a pretty low starting salary and it will take you forever to pay that off. Forget about saving for a house, wedding, etc. when you have that much debt to deal with.\n\nAlso - FWIT, people care much less about where you went to school once you are 10+ years into your career. It basically becomes irrelevant. What matters is that you have the degree, not from where.",

If you want to go somewhere, you will just have to figure out the logistics. I know several people who went to a community college or state college to get their Gen Ed.\u2018s done at a cheaper rate for their freshman year. Talk to a counselor at Emerson to find out more about financial aid and scholarships for students. It\u2019s dependent on the school.",

Transferring after one year defeats the point of trying to save however. You need to be good planner and make sure you are taking credits that will transfer. I don\u2019t remember the percentage (maybe 60%??), but schools have a requirement of the % of credits required from their institution to be considered a graduate from their institution. So you need to account for that. You can\u2019t take 90% of credits elsewhere and be considered an Emerson grad. Best of luck.",

I was able to get a few academic scholarships after my first semester. \nIn other comments, I saw that you really want to have the name recognition of Emerson to open doors at companies. My experience is that the alumni association is piss poor.",

    "postText": "I'm a marketing major and I'll be transferring in as a junior. I've read some awful reviews about the food, professors, and students though. I want to open a ballroom and teach dance as my career; will the professors here give me the right education to run and promote my business? I'm pretty social and I'm into fashion, but I'm not a hipster...are people going to exclude me like it's mean girls or something? Also, partying...I'm leaving my current university (Tampa, Fl) because it's time to get serious, but if I want to go let loose, what are my options for partying? Thanks guys!",

            "comment": "Alright, on this subreddit you're going to get a lot of love for Emerson, but I'll tell you exactly how I feel. Also, I'm from Pembroke Pines (I dunno if you're a native Floridian or whatnot), and Soflo rocks.\n\nAnyway...\n\nI don't think there's anyone at Emerson who hasn't considered transferring. That's because Emerson is a VERY special school. For example, if you are going to Emerson for academia, I'd highly suggest enrolling elsewhere.\n\nThe classes at Emerson are supposed to be as easy as possible, and that's for one reason: Emerson wants you in the marketplace, and they want you in ASAP. You could go to Northwestern and be immersed in a wonderful college campus for four years, but when you come out, where do you turn to? At Emerson, you have internships while being in school, at publications like Houghton Mifflin and Perseus. You have real life experience working on magazines, planning events, being a part of the best college radio in the US, etc., and Emerson wants you to spend your time doing these things. It's a hands-on kind of place. But keep in mind that you can't just decide \"hey, I'm going to be a part of this organization\" because Emerson doesn't work like that and life doesn't work like that. You have to put in effort, you've gotta network, and - as much as I hate this expression - get your head in the door in order to like it here.\n\nOn to food. The dining hall is decent. We're run by Aramark, and I think UT is too. We've got pasta, pizza, wraps, burgers, a salad bar, vegan station, etc. We also have three on campus cafes where you can get another variety of foods. If you're worried you won't like the food, when you come out and visit (because you should definitely visit before transferring), PM me and I'll let you in on a guest meal. Also, keep in mind that if you're transferring in as a junior, you probably won't get housing, so you'll live off-campus and might not want a meal plan, anyway.\n\nAs for your question about opening a ballroom, we have dance courses and we have marketing courses. I'm sure there's someone at Emerson who can connect you with someone in the business, but keep in mind that just a Marketing major may not be enough to get this done. Consider a minor in Business. Also, be prepared, because your life plans may change.\n\nWhen it comes to socializing, I find that the typical Emerson student is hipster, but not overtly hipster. It's one of those situations where people like indie music and Raybans, but they also make fun of hipsters. For partying, in the weekends it's in Allston, which is right off the T (Public transportation) or at someone's apartment. If you want to go out, there will always be a place to do so.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask. I went through a period of wanting to transfer out because I didn't immerse myself in the Emerson community. Now I'm very glad I stayed. ",

If you take the right classes and have some measure of self-initiative, you'll be able to get what you need out of Emerson education-wise.\n\nAs far as partying, strict(ish) restrictions and the cramped nature of converted office building dorms makes partying on-campus difficult outside of small friend groups. There's plenty of options to get your groove on off-campus, generally in Allston, especially if you join a few clubs or a sorority. ",

    "postText": "For those who are transferring and with the current pandemic going on, do you still plan on commiting by June 1st and if it comes to it, taking classes online? Or do you plan on deferring for a semester? I just feel it would be essential to take classes for something such as comedic arts as an in-person experience. The price of tuition is also another factor.",

I went for film and while it was a great experience I would be so much better off if I had just started working. Further along in my career and without 100k in debt....",

Though as an international student, I need to carefully evaluate and pick my options so I wanted to ask and see if anyone here had any experiences with this program or similar ones at Emerson. Do you think it would be worth or not? Thank you for your answers in advance!",

            "comment": "I graduated from the program. For me, it was worth it, but it depends on what you want to get out of it. Emerson's program is split between the actual writing aspect and the publishing end of it (layout, marketing, etc.). For me, it was worth it for the workshop courses, for learning how to self-pub my work, and for the broadening of my reading and technique scope. If you're looking for a strictly writing program, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a well-rounded program that will show the ins and outs of publishing, you've found your school.",

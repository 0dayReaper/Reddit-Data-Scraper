            "comment": "Researchers at the University of Ottawa would like to conduct 90-minute telephone interviews with anyone who has used mifepristone (also known as the abortion pill, medication abortion, or medical abortion) to end a pregnancy. \n \nYou are eligible if you:  \nUsed mifepristone to have an abortion on or after January 1, 2015  \nWere living in Massachusetts at the time \nAre sufficiently fluent in English to answer interview questions \nHave access to a telephone, Skype, or Zoom \n \nDuring the interview, we will ask you series of questions about your background, your reproductive health history, and the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. We will also ask you to tell us about your experience obtaining an abortion with pills and we will ask you to tell us about ways in which you think that services could be improved. \n \nAll participants will receive a $40 gift certificate to www.amazon.com. Participation is both voluntary and confidential. Spots for this study are filled on a first come, first served basis. \n \nPlease note that the abortion pill is not the same thing as emergency contraception, also known as Plan B or \"the morning after pill.\" \n \nIf you would like more information about the study or research team, or if you are interested in participating, please contact us at ws-stu02@uottawa.ca. You may also contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Angel M. Foster, at angel.foster@uottawa.ca.",

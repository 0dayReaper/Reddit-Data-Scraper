If you are a transfer or upperclassman you may not even be guaranteed housing. \n\nAll freshmen live in Little Building, and I'm pretty sure they don't have rooms with 'their own' bathrooms or singles at all (not positive about that one). If you REALLY want a single, regardless of year, the only way it will happen is you give them some very good medical reason.\n\nThe majority of Emerson are 2x2 or 3x2 suites. Meaning two doubles or three doubles, which would then share 2x full bathrooms (shitter+shower). \n\nIf you want a single badly, as soon as you accept Emerson you should email housing with some bullshit like 'I have severe anxiety and sleep apnea and cannot sleep in a room with another person' and hope they don't ask for a doctors note to prove legitimacy. You're definitely not guaranteed to get one even like this, but it's worth a shot.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a reason to choose another school over Emerson, don't let housing be that reason. Every college has shitty housing, especially for freshman, regardless of what model rooms they may have showed you during a tour.",

I mean having a single isn\u2019t a do or die because it seems like I would be having to use the communal bathrooms in that case\n\nI just really want a bathroom in my room. A single is a preference but i will compromise for a bathroom for a number of reasons.\n\nI honestly just hate the whole \u201clive on campus for 3 years\u201d policy",

            "comment": "I can't speak for every setup in Paramount, but mine was a common setup, 2 bedrooms with 2 per room, with a common 2 sinks in the \"hallway\" between the bedrooms, with a stand alone shower and toilet rooms, so someone could shower and not occupy the toilet.\n\nThere were also singles, that basically looked like hotel rooms, single main room with 1 full bath (shower no tub).\n\nI do not recall if there were larger suite setups, apologies it's been a while.",

I'm just hoping the school won't rope me into paying my bills while I am waiting for the form to be processed and accepted. Any information would be helpful!",

Submit the \"proof\" i.e. identification, documentation, etc. that is needed for the leave as soon as you possibly can, because that was part of the holdup with mine. Good luck!",

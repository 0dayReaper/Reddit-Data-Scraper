    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m 16F, and a current junior in Connecticut. I\u2019ve posted here once before. Emerson is my top school and I\u2019m in love with the BCE (Business of Creative Enterprises) major. I\u2019m really worried about finances though. I\u2019ve heard iffy things of financial aid. I\u2019ll know I\u2019ll be able to get aid (I\u2019m assuming so, household income is 35-45k) but it still sounds super intimidating. I\u2019ve started applying for scholarships but even with the average aid cost it\u2019s still really scary.\nI\u2019ve considered community college but I\u2019m unsure how that would work as I\u2019m looking to double minoring at the moment and I\u2019d like to get out of my current home situation... does anyone have more insight into financial aid or simply ways to save money if I wanted to do 4 years of Emerson?\n\nIf it helps at all I have an overall between freshman and Soph year of a 3.7 with a current 4.0 (all weighted). I have yet to take SATs/ACTs but I\u2019m in 6 clubs including president of one.",

Emerson tends to low ball you with financial aid at first, but if you keep asking for assistance, they will do what they can. just to give context, all my college savings from a 529 has been used for my first three semesters. im going to have to pay ~15k for the spring semester, and am looking to move off campus for my junior year. if you really want to go to Emerson, there are a lot of ways (like scholarships) you can actively work for that can help offset costs to something more manageable.",

I\u2019m hoping to maybe get lucky with merit based scholarships and other scholarships I\u2019ll be applying more for in the summer. It\u2019s good to know that it can be done ahah! It\u2019s good to know I can continue to ask for assistance, thank you so much.",

There's a lot of film kids there (I know, I'm one of them), and the theater kids can be a little... much. But overall the campus is nice, basically just a block of the city around the boston common, there's good food around everywhere, and there's usually stuff to do, whether its via clubs or other events. I enjoyed my time there, but do make sure to look at Rate My Professor before signing up for certain classes, because despite most of the teachers being pretty solid, there are a few bad apples there to keep an eye out for.",

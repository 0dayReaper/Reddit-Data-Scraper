Do you think I won\u2019t be able to get on-campus housing and should start looking for off-campus apartments? Need some thoughts from people who\u2019ve transferred or know anything about this!",

If you\u2019re a sophomore I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re going to get a slot compared to someone who\u2019s a junior. I think suites might help out too. I\u2019m not sure.",

            "comment": "Our son is a freshman this year. We had a 0 efc and between the Pell grant, Emerson grant, $5,500 in loans in his name, $2,500 in work study, and a small merit award he ended up with a financial aid package of a little over 46k total, almost full tuition. \n\nFor the balance he received $7,500 in outside scholarships and we are doing a no interest 5 payment plan per semester for the rest. His admissions officer told us that sophomore year he can be a resident advisor which covers all room and board which is almost 20k.",

And don\u2019t get into it if you\u2019re only doing it for the free housing, it is a lot of work and if you\u2019re only do it for the free housing it\u2019s not worth it. Don\u2019t even mention the free housing as a motivation when you\u2019re going through the interview process as it may weed you out.",

The rest of my tuition I paid through a mix of federal and private loans.\n\n2012 data might not be too applicable anymore, I don\u2019t know, but thought I\u2019d share as a reference point. Despite getting a decent amount of financial aid I am still in plenty of debt.",

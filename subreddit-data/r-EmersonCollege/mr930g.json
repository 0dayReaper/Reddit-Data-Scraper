    "postText": "My daughter got accepted to Emerson and her financial aid package (scholarship/grants) are pretty low and we are by no means rich! With tuition,room and board Emerson is close to 80k yr.  how do people afford to pay that?  $240k after 4 years? What\u2019s the average pay for graduates from Emerson?  We can get her some help from our funds but I\u2019d have to get 3 more full time jobs to cover the difference.  Why is the cost so high at Emerson? Also, we went up to see the school this past weekend, everything seemed locked down and closed very early on Saturday, what does everyone do on weekends? Where do clubs meet?  Is there any campus like area? Or only the Commons across the street? Also, we looked thru the 1st floor windows of the dining hall didn\u2019t see a lot of food available,  is that the only campus food option?",

            "comment": "Current student here!\n\n1) I only afford emerson because I\u2019m in the honors college (half tuition scholarship) and an RA (free room and board). You can apply to both of those things at the end of freshman year, and it brings down the cost of emerson to a fourth of what it would be.\n\n2) average pay depends on the industry, but I\u2019d say pretty low to start given that emerson is a place for people who are dreamers trying to break into competitive industries.\n\n3) literally all the students here wonder why the cost is so high too. i can mildly understand room and board because of the prime downtown location of our school. as far as tuition, i think it\u2019s because of all the improvement project emerson has done in the past few years. emerson has expanded A LOT, even just in the years ive been here. from new buildings, to renovated spaces, more programs and opportunities, i think emerson is expanding to become a more notable school and increase our clout, but it for sure is putting a burden on current students pockets. (i for sure could be wrong that it\u2019s so high ((and continues to increase)) because of all the project they are trying to do)\n\n4) emerson was on lockdown this past week because of an increase in covid cases, so things closed early / were restricted. but also, this past year, because of covid, hours and buildings have been wonky and restricted.\n\n5) there are actually a TON of student clubs and TONS of places to meet on campus. i think most emerson students would agree that emerson is an experiential college, and the extracurriculars, like student orgs and clubs, make that experience! there is a ton of space that people meet for clubs, so no need to worry about that haha.\n\n6) emerson is an urban campus so obviously no true campus space (besides our block), but us students don\u2019t complain. we enjoy the common, the city, and most of the time hang in people\u2019s dorm rooms and such.\n\n7) There is only one dining hall that actually has a good bit of options. But there are also 3 other places on campus that provide food (the max, backstage cafe, and paramount cafe). Plus, students with meal plans get a set amount of money each semester to spend at tatte, el jefe, garbonzo, and/or blaze pizza.\n\nhope all my answers helped!! \n\nTL;DR: i would for sure say that emerson is just a specialized school that rely on extracurriculars / the students own hustle to make it worth it. if your child\u2019s major is more universal (like Comm) and can be offered somewhere else, maybe go there instead. if your child is trying to do something like film or theatre, im afraid all schools that cater to those subjects are in the same price same as emerson.",

            "comment": "Current freshman! Hopefully some of this helps:\n\n\\- If you haven't appealed for more financial aid and/or scholarship money, I suggest doing that. I appealed twice for fin aid and scholarships and they managed to offer more. Getting outside private scholarships also helps the first year. Additionally, I'm working two part-time jobs. The school provides a website, Workday, that allows students to apply for on campus jobs. Going the RA route definitely brings down the cost besides moving off-campus with a group of people. Cost of tuition is so high because it's a private university and in order to keep up with all the opportunities they're giving us and the facilities, tuition has to burn a hole in our pockets. \n\n\\- As someone else said, we were in a soft quarantine this past week due to covid cases, so most things were pretty quiet. It's hard to generalise what people do on weekends. Performing arts majors are probably in Emerson Stage rehearsals. Visual Media Arts majors are probably on film sets. Athletes usually have their games on Saturday (at least this semester they were). Other people just hang out with friends in the Boston Common, Charles River, and residential halls. Different students will have different answers. Without COVID, I know some parties would happen especially at nearby colleges.",

            "comment": "I second everything that the two non-cynical students posted. Emerson is stupidly overpriced, like every private college in America (hell, even state schools are overpriced nowadays). However, I was able to get lots of aid from the school my negotiating and comparing other offers. I am in my senior year after transferring from a community college, and I came to this school specifically to make connections in the television industry, and in my 2.5 years here, I've managed to accrue just under $17k total in debt, all in government loans. I am exploring some excellent job opportunities post grad, in the industry I've always dreamt of working in. \n\nSo, don't refinance your home or get another job. But if you can get the cost down a good amount (which is possible), Emerson affords a great education and, from my position, grest career opportunities",

They finally replied and did offer a little more aid, not much.  It is till the lowest of the three schools she is considering.  And we did let the office know what the other schools offered.",

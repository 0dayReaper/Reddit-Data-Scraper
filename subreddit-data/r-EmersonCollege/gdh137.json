    "postText": "I am already admitted into Emerson for this coming fall as a media arts production major. However, I have always been curious about Emerson's Global BFA program. I did some more research and watched a seminar, and I am even more intrigued by the program. Now obviously it is slightly late to apply for the program, but I reached out to Emerson staff to see if I would still be able to switch majors and it seems like I would at least have the chance to still apply. I am still not certain if this program is right for me and if it would provide me with better education/opportunities in film. I really love challenging myself and learning as much as I can, so the program could be a great experience for myself. One extra thing that is attractive is the fact that you graduate a year earlier, meaning it would cost less and I would be able to look for a job earlier. However, I am still debating whether or not I would miss out on the \"traditional\" college experience. If any of you have opinions on this or have experience in either program, I would love to hear!",

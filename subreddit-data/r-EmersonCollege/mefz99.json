            "comment": "I graduated last year with a creative writing degree, but I did attend the LA campus which was heavily geared towards film, especially the business and networking side of film.\n\nBusiness of Creative Enterprise is still a relatively new program that began when I was a freshman, at the time almost everyone I knew who was in the program either switched majors to marketing or transferred completely, and I actually knew a couple people who were getting film degrees that ended up transferring to Chapman.\n\nEmerson really prioritizes their alum network as a way to get \u201cin\u201d to the business and talks up their robust network of people in LA, but tbh I don\u2019t think the actual classes will give you skills you couldn\u2019t find at most other schools when it comes to marketing/production. What Emerson IS good at is giving you opportunities to work on student run sets that\u2019ll give you tons of practical experience and will allow you to do real production and learn alongside other people.\n\nI thought I was gonna fall in love with downtown Boston where the campus is located but I, like most people I know, ended up only really liking the city once we moved out to our own apartments in another neighborhood like JP or Eastie.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have specific questions I didn\u2019t answer, I can\u2019t speak about Chapman but I can totally speak to stuff like campus life, orgs, stuff like that!",

            "comment": "I cant speak to the 'Business of Creative Enterprises' Degree Program, but I can color some of the other responses with my experience. \n\nI graduated in '15 with a degree in Studio TV Production. I had a job offer in writing from the company that I interned with on the day that I graduated. An Emerson Alum got me that internship, and I firmly believe that Emerson helped launch me to where I am today. \n\nFrom my experience Emerson kept up their side of the deal. True to form, the 'Emerson Mafia'  gave me my start in the industry.\n\nI have classmates that don't have the same experience, classmates that spent 4 years at Emerson and never made it into the industry. \n\n/u/JelliedBoat makes an astute statement *' What Emerson IS good at is giving you opportunities to work on student run sets that\u2019ll give you tons of practical experience and will allow you to do real production and learn alongside other people.'* If you are going to take advantage of that side of the school; put in the leg work to get the abundance of experience available on student productions, grow your network at the school and develop professional relationships, than Emerson is probably unmatched in the educational experience. \n\nIf you want to be able to just take classes and have them be your full education than I think your money is better spent elsewhere. Emerson's strength is its practicum, not its academics.",

I would love to know what do you learn specifically there? If it's aligned with your expectations or it turned out to be totally different. \nThanks :)",

The other half of your major courses can be taken in other departments. So if you like movies, you can take courses in the film major and have them count towards your BCE degree. It\u2019s a great way to learn how to work in upper management of the film industry but you may not be learning the nitty gritty of being on a film set. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t do other things at Emerson to gain this knowledge, I\u2019m a super strong advocate for Emerson\u2019s extra-curriculars. I focus in TV and Theatre so working on student sets allows me to gain hands on experience of working with equipment and stuff while my classes teach me about managing a set and things like that. I\u2019m a big fan of the BCE major but it\u2019s not for everyone. If you know it\u2019s what you want to do for sure, I totally recommend it!",

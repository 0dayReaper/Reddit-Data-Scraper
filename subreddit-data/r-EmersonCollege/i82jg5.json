    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am looking to return to school for my masters and was looking at Emerson because the popular fiction and publishing masters seems to be exactly what I'm looking for in a program.\nI was hoping that any current students or former students of this program could give me their experience and what they got out of it. I would also like to know whether or not you think the cost is worth it? Especially since the program is online.\nAny help/advice would be great.",

            "comment": "Hi! I just found this thread but still wanted to answer your question. I'm in my last semester of this program. Pros: the writing workshops are awesome. Cons: there's a lot more literary fiction than I expected and a lot less popular fiction. The publishing info is several years behind. There is no true focus on the genres of romance, thrillers, cozy mysteries, or urban fantasy, though one professsor does a pretty great workshop on YA fantasy. \n\nI was also accepted to Seton Hill's Writing Popular Fiction program but chose Emerson because it's all around better ranked. However, after going through the program, I wish I would have gone with Seton Hill simply because their workshops are taught by people who work and are successful in their pop fic genres. Their focus is not literary at all and solely focuses on pop fic. Emerson does not do that and I found that a disappointing aspect of the program. \n\nJust the past semester they added a workshop supposed to focus on romance. I can't speak on it right now, but the initial reading list is a little disappointing and does not have the biggest hitters in the genre. \n\nI received a scholarship for the program that covers a good chunk of tuition per semester and have assistance from elsewhere, so the cost was at times zero and other times minimal. \n\nI'm a multi-published author working in the field since 2011, so if you decide to apply, you might have a totally different opinion. I keep up with all the publishing news in traditional and indie publishing and stay on top of new releases, advertising, the bestseller lists, etc. I feel like Emerson is several years behind in their genre research and focuses too much on classics. \n\nHowever, most of the professors I had were great and knowledgeable in their fields. I had no issues there. If you're paying out of pocket or taking loans and want a serious study in pop fic, I might look to Seton Hill, though, and compare them.",

Even with it, I could not afford to attend as tuition charges were much more than I originally calculated.\nI will look into Seton Hill. Thanks!",

(Just been admitted.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take your criticism of it as being weak on some pop genres seriously.  Do you think you could comment a bit on whether you think that's also true of horror, which is what I focus on?  Also, could you elaborate a little on what you liked about the workshops themselves?  Did the online format interfere?  Help?",

                            "comment": "Congrats! I can't answer your questions about horror. It isn't a genre I write in at all. I'm solely writing paranormal romance and cozies. However, I don't recall there being any specific classes focused on horror (but I also wasn't actively looking). The writing workshops usually had more current works to study and analyze, although it's arguable whether many of the selections were actually popular fiction. Many slant toward classics or literary genres, rather than true pop fic. The workshops all have a pretty familiar formula: reading assignments, discussion boards, and workshop critiques where you post several pages of your work for others to read and critique. When you get good critiques, they're worth their weight in gold, but you'll have to wade through a lot of unhelpful ones first usually. One course I would strongly suggest is Novel Bootcamp taught by Edwin Hill, though you won't be allowed to take it until your last semester. It's extremely helpful. \n\nBe advised that many, though not all, of the professors teaching in Pop Fic are published with literary presses and not genre presses or larger top 5 publishers. Also know any literature classes you take will probably not have many, if any, pop fic selections. They lean heavily on classics or much older works. This isn't always true, of course, but it was usually more true than not. I found this one of the more frustrating aspects of the program and when I questioned it, the response I received was pretty elitist and suggested I was limiting myself by not reading outside pop fic genres. I found this hilarious as I have been running a book club for twelve years where every month we have a different type of book, but it wasn't worth arguing over. I pressed through and just graduated and anything I didn't care to read, I could usually find a pretty good summary online or skim it enough to get the gist of it. Not very literary, I know, but this is my second Masters and after a couple of frustrating semesters where we weren't examining a lot of pop fic, I just buckled down and got it done. Like I said, I've been published for many, many years, both indie and traditional. There wasn't too much I could have learned, but I would have enjoyed a deeper study of pop fic and craft, and I don't think I received too much of that when all was said and done. \n\nHowever, like with all things, your mileage may vary, especially if you're new or newish to writing genre fiction. I went into this as an advanced student and didn't pay for it, so it all worked out in the end, I suppose.",

I gained a lot of knowledge with layout, design, marketing, etc. My thesis novel just got picked up by Bloodshot Books (it'll be out next year, I believe), and another I wrote while I was there won the graduate publishing award. To me, it was a fantastic experience. If you have any questions about the program or such, hit me up. Happy to answer.",

I do have a few more questions though.\n\nWere you on any type of financial aid (not loans)? I am curious to know if online students also get considered for their program scholarships or are the scholarships strictly reserved for full-time in-person students.\n\nWhat was your mentor/advisor relationship like as an online student? Do you get to choose your advisor or are they assigned to you?\n\nHow did you present your thesis/dissertation? Was it a Zoom call or something? lol\n\nLastly, I'm super curious to know how networking works for the online students. How did you meet people in the field?\n\nAgain, thank you for responding!",

When it was all said and done, it equaled up to, I think, about $500 per term. Mentors were assigned, but we kind of gravitated toward the teachers we liked (I worked well with several). Thesis presentation was, if you can believe it, over Google Hangouts. No kidding. It was weird. For networking, I stay in touch with the students in my class to a degree, but also I found out there's a meet-up here in the Austin area for Emerson alumni. Other than graduation, I never set foot on campus. But I did go for the graduation, and so I got to meet quite a few of my classmates.",

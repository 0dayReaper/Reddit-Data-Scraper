    "postText": "hi,\nrecently i went with my friends to the st paddy\u2019s day parade in southie and we had our pictures taken on the red line. unfortunately i did not catch the name of the photographer, but he had an emerson lanyard on, so i\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a clue towards finding him! he had a name tag that my friend got a blurry pic of, but the only thing we can see is what look like a \u2018j\u2019 as the first letter of his first name. he seemed to be a bit older, maybe a junior/senior if not already graduated and had a small beard that if im remembering right only stuck out from his jawline (not covering his chin or anything if that makes sense). i\u2019ve tried searching the internet but i can\u2019t find anything, so i was hoping someone could maybe point me in the right direction or even maybe the photographer might see this. my name is erin and my friend was olivia if this helps at all (he asked us for our first names). i don\u2019t think the pics were for the school or anything because i\u2019m p sure he said it was a personal project. Thank you so much!!",

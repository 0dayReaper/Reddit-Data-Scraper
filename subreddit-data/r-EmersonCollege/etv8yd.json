    "postText": "Hey, friends. Looking for some film students to give me an impression of the experience at these schools. I\u2019m applying as a transfer for the production track of the respective programs. A couple points for personal criteria: I\u2019d like to be able to learn with actors (BU\u2019s Theatre minor looks great), get involved with music (I understand that Emerson students can cross-register at Berklee), and need-based financial aid is a concern as well. I\u2019m not currently locked in to a certain aspect of filmmaking.\n\nI worry about Emerson for a couple reasons: their students have been listed among the unhappiest in the country many times over and I\u2019ve heard that the financial aid department is borderline useless. Unless I\u2019m wrong, they can\u2019t guarantee housing and I thought I\u2019d live on campus for a while to get set up. All those things considered, I\u2019ve still been led to believe that the networking and the program itself is better than BU\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019d love to pick anybody\u2019s brain about this, film student or not.\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm a recent Emerson alum from the Visual &amp; Media Arts department (I studied Television Production specifically). To first answer your personal criteria notes, I'd say that Emerson provides an amazing atmosphere for collaboration, especially with both theatre or film actors at the school and with Boston area professionals. Another thing on that note that is cool is that we have a course called Directing Actors for Screen that pairs with a course for actors called Acting for the Screen (or something like that) where directors and actors work together all semester. \n\nIn terms of happiness, I think a lot of Emerson students love the school but recognize systemic problems with it as well -- these problems are present at almost every college or university, however. Emerson students are very passionate and liberal and try to change these systems while also achieving an education and experience in their field, which is altogether very stressful. Does that make sense? I would definitely say, however, that I was very happy with my Emerson education and it has already helped me in my career.\n\nFor housing, Emerson actually just opened a few new and/or updated dorms, so they require you to live on campus for THREE years now. Most people complete their degree in four years or less, and/or do one semester at another Emerson campus (for example, I went to Emerson Los Angeles my last semester). So really, you only now need housing for about a year or less. I had no problem finding housing, and honestly it's a great experience for post-grad to have done an apartment search before. \n\nNetworking/making connections and the Emerson student organizations are what make the school amazing. The student orgs provide valuable experience you can't find anywhere else. The \"Emerson Mafia\", our alumni network, is so powerful and present in the TV and film industry. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. I'm happy to answer!",

I\u2019d love to hear more about your experience there and how it\u2019s helped you adjust professionally.",

                            "comment": "I'm from the Boston area originally, so going to ELA was my transition to living in Los Angeles for good ( knew I wanted to go to Los Angeles for my career, as the main options for our work is Los Angeles or New York, and I don't personally want to live in New York). The ELA program is great for this transition, as it is basically solely reserved for graduating seniors who might want to move to LA. For ELA's program, you are required to do an internship (for 4 or 8 credits), a couple regular courses, a few hours of professional development, and live on campus in Hollywood. This is actually all super great - 1) you don't have to find an apartment in LA prior to coming here, and if you want to stay you can find an apartment for after the semester, 2) there are tons of places hiring interns in Los Angeles, and many places provide really great connections and experiences that will be valuable post-grad (especially if you stay in LA), 3) the classes you take in ELA are probably the best courses in the school - for example, I took a Production Management course where I learned how to use scheduling and budgeting software that they actually use in the industry and directly correlates to my current job, and 4) the professional development experiences are actually really cool and interesting overall, and provide more Emerson connections and great insider industry knowledge. Overall, the ELA program definitely helped me adjust professionally and most certainly proved the power of the Emerson Mafia. \n\nHope that helps! Feel free to keep questions coming.",

If you don't mind answering a couple more questions regarding Emerson, I would grealy appreciate it..\n\n1) How difficult is it to get into the Emerson LA program? That would be something I would want to do, but didn't know how selective it is.\n\n2) Are you able to do the BFA in Media Arts Production and still go to Emerson LA?\n\n3) Regarding student life/atmosphere, is political talk constantly a big part of it?\n\nI am still deciding between attending Emerson, LMU, UT Austin, Temple and Depaul for Film -- so trying to really understand the strenghts and weaknesses of the schools and programs.\n\nThank you.",

If you are an enthusiastic and involved student AND you are not a transfer student, you should have no problem getting into the LA program. Everyone I knew who applied got in, however, transfer students often don't get priority for the program and may be asked to go a different semester than requested (for example, I applied to go the spring semester, which is way more popular, and some transfer students I know were only accepted if they pick the fall semester instead). Honestly, so many students at Emerson are super involved and self-motivated, so it's really not too difficult by junior/senior year to have enough experience/credits to be accepted to ELA.\n2. Yes, I didn't do this personally but I knew many who did. You have to do the BFA program over the course of a year (two semesters), but it doesn't matter which semesters that is. In fact, I believe many choose to do their thesis film Spring-Fall and shoot over the summer and use fall for post production and go to ELA in the spring. \n3. I guess it depends on what you mean by this. You do have to understand that Emerson and Boston is generally super liberal and if you are right-wing/conservative, you will have a much harder time at the school. That being said, I wouldn't say political talk is the focus of the school since so many are focused on their specific major. Major-related courses won't really talk politics at all, however your liberal arts requirements DEFINITELY will. In terms of just general student living/atmosphere, a lot of students have a very liberal, left-leaning ideology and many are student activists. It's not to say if you are conservative you won't have any friends, but there will be a lot of people who will not like your viewpoints and argue with you. \n\nHope that helps! Feel free to message or reply with more questions.",

            "comment": "Emerson guarantees housing for you first two years. You aren\u2019t allowed to live off campus your first two years unless you get special permission from the school. After my second year I had to move to off-campus housing but I\u2019ve heard rumors they\u2019re gonna have the 3rd year be on campus as well. \n\nEmerson has good collaboration both at the school and with other schools, like a lot of people used Berklee students for music and stuff.\n\nWhat you heard about financial aid is pretty accurate. A lot of students don\u2019t get much aid and I heard many friends who were annoyed about it. Not many people I know had to drop out but a handful did because it was too expensive.\n\nRegarding happiness I would somewhat but not entirely agree. Emerson students aren\u2019t miserable but rather what I would maybe call angsty. I was there in 2016 and when Trump got elected people were legitimately crying. None of my other friends had that happening at their schools. It\u2019s not that people are upset because of living conditions or anything like that, although sometimes people get annoyed at the school but that\u2019s in like your third year and is common at most colleges",

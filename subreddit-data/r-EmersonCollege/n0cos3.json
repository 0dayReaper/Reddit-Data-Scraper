    "postText": " May 1st is almost here and I still haven't decided on a college and I'm really worried about making the wrong choice. \n\nI'm going for Journalism as my major. It is important to me that I have good opportunities for internships and such during college. \n\nEmerson: It's right in the heart of Boston and the area is great. I never actually got an opportunity to tour the school because of Covid, but I did explore the area and really liked it. From what I've seen, it has a great Journalism program, but I'm a little worried about it being more focused on broadcast journalism rather than print journalism and writing, but I don't know if this is true.\n\nS.I. Newhouse: It's a part of Syracuse University. The campus is really nice, but I also felt like the school is kind of in the middle of nowhere. The Newhouse buildings seemed really nice, with a lot of state of the art facilities. I think it is considered a great journalism school, but I don't know how it compares to Emerson.\n\nAs for cost, it isn't as important as both schools cost almost the same, and I got just about the same amount of financial aid from both schools. I'm really worried about making a choice, so if anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it.",

            "comment": "Can\u2019t really go wrong here. Both are great schools. It mostly depends on where you want to live and what you want to do. Do you want to do sports journalism? If so, Syracuse is definitely the place to do it. Is news more your thing? then Emerson is the best choice as you can be in a major city with a lot more going on. Syracuse can kind of feel like it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere at times. It\u2019s possible you\u2019d have better access to internships at Emerson because Boston will have far more opportunities. \n\nAs far as the social scenes go, Syracuse will offer a much more \u201ctraditional\u201d college scene (frat parties, sports games, etc). At Emerson you will be surrounded by people with a huge drive to succeed and are simply looking to learn and grow, mostly through collaboration. This is a good for some and not for others, depends on your personality. Pretty much everyone does extra curriculars and that\u2019s where you make your friends.\n\nI made a similar choice four years ago. I\u2019m graduating from Emerson this year and have been very happy with my education. Hope this helps",

            "comment": "Might be right about Emerson being more focused on broadcast than print but I definitely had friends who studied journalism and focused on print. \n\nAlso, as someone who kinda found their niche career path in a major, it can be easy to find a mentor who aligns with that and is invested in helping you learn. I\u2019d say Emerson has a huge plus when it comes to the individual attention you can get from professors and faculty. I never had a single class with an actual TA. Pretty much always spoke directly with the professors. Not sure how that aligns with a big school like Syracuse but worth considering",

I am not enrolled in the Film and Media Arts, so I don't want to speak too much on that, but from what I hear with my friends, they enjoy the program. For me, Emerson has been a fantastic experience. I live on campus, so I dont know how commuting will compare, but i do know the T offers a very convenient stop on the Green Line to get to Bolyston. The courses that I've taken have all been rewarding, often there are hurdles you have to get through, but that's the nature of college work. In terms of out of the classroom filmmaking, there are a number of clubs / organizations that you can rely on to help you promote whatever you're doing. I act, so I've been auditioning for short films all this past year. \n\nI hope all of this has been helpful! Lemme know if you have any other questions",

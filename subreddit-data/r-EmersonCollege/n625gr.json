There are people who don't have any degrees and are doing great and there are people who have MFA's and they're doing great too. perhaps the OP wants to get their MFA to expand their knowledge/experience, not everyone can just jump into projects willy nilly, I'm speaking from experience with literally working in the industry. Getting an MFA can actually even help network and get your films into festivals and establish a portfolio. If OP can afford it, let them determine if it's worth it or not.",

I will say I love Emerson, and I've already made some huge connects in the entertainment industry during undergrad. Alumni network is great. The general quality of education here is good, imho, but again, can't speak to MFA.\n\nThat said, MFAs are expensive-- Emerson especially! And, anecdotally from talking to L.A. friends (and my brother), and Emerson alums, I don't know how necessary they are to being a director. So, MFA is good if your financial situation permits, and you want to learn more about your craft, but I don't know if it will open more doors than a Bachelors in this industry. This is again based on anecdotes, and I'm sorry I can't be more helpful!",

However, Emerson has a huge alumni network of L.A. people, and lots of students do internships in L.A. or study at Emerson's L.A. campus for a semester. I'm actually gonna be out there doing a class and an internship all summer! So, I'm pretty ok studying here and then going there. Not everyone feels how I do, but it's definitely a solid school.",

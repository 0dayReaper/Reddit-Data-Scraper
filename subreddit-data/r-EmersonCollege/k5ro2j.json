    "postText": "I am currently talking to a coach at Emerson about potentially playing there in college, and I\u2019m just looking for honest opinions on the school. I would most likely be a VMA major. Obviously education is the most important factor, and I\u2019ve already looked into that and I really love the program, but does Emerson have a good social aspect? Do people go to parties/clubs/etc? Obviously thats not my main factor, but it\u2019d be nice to know that life there will be fun, as well as a good academic experience. Also, are all the stereotypes true about the people that go to Emerson? I consider myself liberal, artistic, and extroverted but sometimes hearing about how cliquey people are is a little intimidating.",

            "comment": "The Emerson standard during my time there was that all the time you'll spend working on film shoots, theatrical events, and generally producing content essentially WILL be your social life Which isn't all too bad because you're gonna be spending a lot of time doing things you love with people with similar interests. Of course, there will always be time for you to hang out with your friends yet it's important to know that you will find yourself with a loaded schedule.\n\nThere are tons of organizations for you to get involved with and meet a ton of amazing people. Some organizations can be cliquey but you're bound to find some groups and people that cater to what you want in a good social circle.\n\nAs for partying, you'll have to go off-campus. More traditional colleges in the Boston area will have some classic frat parties, but if you're looking to party with people you know there's always gonna be a good 20-30 person party in someone's cramped Allston apartment. Also, it's a city! Once you turn 21, or 18 for some places, you can start going out to clubs.\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "Current Emerson sophomore living on-campus both semesters this year! Im in the school of communication, but my suitemate is a VMA major, and there are a multitude of things he keeps himself busy with.\n\nin terms of a social life, I know some current students (myself included) experience a lack of social opportunities since COVID restrictions were implemented this year. As a freshman, there are various different opportunities to interact and get to know your classmates in LB. the all freshman dorm does a great job getting you used to people in your year, major, etc.! I live in a different building now, which has limited space and opportunities for people to hang out. I blame COVID a lot more for this, as most of the time you would be able to have friends over from other schools / dorms. during a normal year, you can usually find some parties (although nothing like the classic frat parties). \n\nI would say it depends entirely on what you're looking for socially. if you're a big party person, Emerson really doesn't do that, but as other users mentioned, Boston has a whole bunch of opportunities for you to engage with people there! you'll find what you're looking for, just depends on the timing. for example, I used to go to a lot of live shows around the city, would visit other campuses to meet different people, and generally explore the city. COVID has messed it up, but once this is all over, we stand a pretty good chance of getting to experience all those things again soon!\n\nI hope this helped, feel free to ask me any additional questions and I will do what I can to answer them fully! Good luck on your college decision :)",

            "comment": "Hi I just did 1 semester as a freshman which was super cool bro. As a freshman you live in Little Building and you get pretty close with the people on your floor. Also there are a ton of orgs outside of sports to join, especially if you\u2019re looking for something artistic. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the social aspect, you\u2019ll definitely be able to find friends to hang with. \n\nHanging out with other Boston schools is hard just cause you have to meet people from the schools, but a ton of students always hang out in the Gardens and the esplanade both of which are super close to Emerson.",

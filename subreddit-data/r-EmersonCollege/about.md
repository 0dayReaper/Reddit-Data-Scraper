Description:

Bringing innovation to communication and the arts (and not math). This subreddit is for Emerson College students, alumni, faculty, or for Suffolk students who live up the street and are kind of jealous but really just have friends at Emerson and like the internet.

Rules:

Keep Things Emerson-Related: Tangential relation is fine! But please don't post your non-Emerson events, advertisements for general college things, unrelated casting calls, or random news. You can take in-town things over to /r/Boston or /r/Massachusetts

Keep It Civil: Please remember the human - the person on the other side of the screen is a person just like you.  Please follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) and be kind.

/r/EmersonCollege has no place for hate. The reward for harassment and abuse is a ban - congratulations!

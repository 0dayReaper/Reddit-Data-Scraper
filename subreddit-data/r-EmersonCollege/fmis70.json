    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was just recently accepted into Emerson and am currently weighing out my options. Emerson is definitely in the running, but I was wondering what current students/more informed applicants thought on a major in Communication Disorders. \n\nI'm extremely interested in studying linguistics and working with the Deaf community and want to be an SLP. What opportunities would I be able to earn by majoring in CD and what's the workload like?",

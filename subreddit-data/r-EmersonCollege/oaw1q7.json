    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI guess the title pretty much explains it. I was accepted into Emerson as a graduate student and received a partial scholarship. While I am thankful for the scholarship, it is MUCH, much less than I need.\n\nFor those of you (both, undergraduate students and graduate students) that attended Emerson College, did you find attending to be worth it? If so, please let me know in what ways was it worth it?\n\nFor those that are currently attending, do you think the cost is worth the skills you are gaining? Do you think your job prospects will be good upon graduation?\n\nI thank anyone willing to share their experiences. I have a month to decide to unenroll or actually attend.\n\nI am interested in hearing stories from anyone, but if anyone is curious, I was accepted into the Popular Fiction Writing &amp; Publishing MFA.\n\n*EDIT 6/13/21* \nThank you everyone for your replies. I was able to make my decision.",

Most people I know from school found work in the industry they went to school for, but not always the career they had hoped or planned for.\n\nGetting your bang for your buck? Personally I don't think that the classes themselves meaningfully prepared me for my career, but being surrounded by people who had similar career aspirations did.\n\nAll in all, I'd do it again",

Building working relationships with those people and using that to start your career helps. Also getting involved with alumni and using that Emerson name recognition has its benefits. \n\nThe alumni friends and I all agree it's what you make it and if you spend that extra time outside of class it can really pay off later.\n\n2007 Grad here, I also benefitted from not too many student loans.",

But it depends on what you want to get out of it. For me though, it was worth it.",

The classes are ok all around, and if you do your research you can find a couple great ones, but the price tag is basically for unique access to a wide range of people who can help jumpstart your career. However, everyone else either knows this, figures it out, or has a rich dad and is just hanging out in Boston. \n\nAll in all it is a fun time though, and don\u2019t let the few uber liberal folks paint the school as a haven for nut jobs. Cause I met plenty of fun-loving and great people while I was there!",

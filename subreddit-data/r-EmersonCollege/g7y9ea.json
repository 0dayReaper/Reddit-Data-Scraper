    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m really conflicted about my college choices and I was accepted as a VMA major at Emerson. I would be concentrating in animation. I\u2019m wondering if people within the program could speak to animation courses. Also pro arts Boston program? I wonder if anyone who is part of that could speak to it, as I would like to take the traditional art classes at these other colleges/universities. I would appreciate any help I could get! Thank you :)",

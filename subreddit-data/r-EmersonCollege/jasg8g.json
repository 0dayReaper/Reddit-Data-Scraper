But did you find it easy to make friends after you transferred? Does the school have a good alumni program for film majors? Did you enjoy living in Boston? The main reason I didn\u2019t choose to go to Emerson was the lack of campus, but I\u2019m not sure if I mind now.",

Even so I think I missed out on some of the Emerson/college experience by not making friends living in the dorms and focusing too much on work and internships during my studies, so keep that in mind. \n\nBoston has a lot to offer for my profession (I was a Marketing major and found my way into the tech scene easily) but I can't speak for film. Many of my Emerson connections are doing well in film and television careers and I see a lot of activity around those in the alum groups. \n\nAll of this is pre-COVID so take the advice with a grain of salt. If I was in your position I'd work on my own projects or find an apprenticeship/internship until things return to some normalcy. Maybe knock a couple gen eds out of the way to CLEP exams or an online course.\n\nOne other thing that isn't transfer-specific is that you should embrace the liberal arts classes which I personally found a lot of joy in and learned about topics I had no idea I'd be interested in. I got way more out of those than the major-specific classes I had to take.\n\nGood luck with your journey!",

    "postText": "Hey Emerson Students, \n\nI run a non-profit organization called Help and Share Education. We basically collect used and unwanted SAT/ACT prep books in order to donate to the underfunded and low-income students in the Boston area. More specifically, it would go towards high schools that are in need. I am basically writing this in hopes of anyone in this subreddit that you would be willing to donate theirs for the kids. If not, that is all okay, but if you are able to spread the message, that would be amazing!\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\nHere is my website if you want to check out: hase.vercel.app",

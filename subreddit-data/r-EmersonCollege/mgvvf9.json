            "comment": "I'm a freshman, and I've taken 8 classes now. Needless to say, I haven't learned anything all year, in my policomm classes we only talk about racism and how america is bad. Also, lots of weird kids, not as bad as the theater crowd though. Not a lot of homework either. You'll be taking intro to speech comm, that class is amazing as long as you get the right professor, it was the only class that I have enjoyed. Look for Shane Martin, he rules. You won't get much of anything besides a very liberal perspective, so I would encourage you to take everything that you hear with a grain of salt, most kids just go along with it even when it's strange. Some girls tried to cancel Disney movies during one class period and people just game them stares. I recommend finding a few normal kids and making an effort to get to know them. That will greatly improve your experience.",

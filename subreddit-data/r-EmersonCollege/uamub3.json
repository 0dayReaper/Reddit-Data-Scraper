    "postText": "Basically title. I go to bed at 9 PM on weekdays and 10 PM on weekends, I have had this sleep schedule since I was 6. My suite mates, all year, have put me through hell. They are constantly staying up past midnight and listening to music, watching movies, or talking (without inviting me mind you)! It is completely inconsiderate. It is literally 12:30 right now and I can\u2019t fall asleep because they are so annoying. I texted one of the guys and it got me nowhere.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/NQdUZn6\n\nAny advice?\n\nEDIT: Since people seem to be missing the point, I should also mention they have been smoking WEED every now and again. I didn\u2019t report that but maybe I should?",

And why the need to report them to an RA before at least attempting some kind of conversation first? \n\nUnfortunately for you, it doesn\u2019t sound like they really did anything wrong other than not being able to read your mind, so the punishment will likely be nonexistent or minimal, if anything. All you did here was get them to hate you for snitching instead of talking to them like a normal person, and they\u2019re probably gonna keep doing it even more since, again, music, talking, and movies are in no way prohibited in the dorms. Maybe you should\u2019ve gotten a single if the ordinary noises of college students interacting at midnight (not even that late in my opinion) bother you so much.",

It\u2019s not like anything they did was personal\u2014they might not even have realized it was bothering you until you lashed out in text. You didn\u2019t even give them a chance to compromise with you; instead, you are insistent that they get handed out some sort of consequences on your behalf, based on rules that are both arbitrary and relevant to no one but you. The way you are acting is vindictive, hostile, and downright uncool. Honestly, YOU\u2019RE the kind of roommate I would hate to have. Refusing to communicate and tattling without a second thought is giving strong soon-to-be karen vibes.\n\nEdit: the fact that you reported them for \u201ctargeted harassment\u201d when in actuality they were just being regular college students in a communal living space only further solidifies my point.",

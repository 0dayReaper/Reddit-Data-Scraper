Is there anything missing in your Syracuse experience? \nYou need to make a list of pros and cons for each school before you can make a decision. And also think on what aspects of the college experience are important to you.\nI\u2019d look at things like academic opportunities, social life, class size, city differences, etc.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that my daughter might be choosing between those two schools (waiting on other college decisions first). We\u2019re tentatively planning on touring both campuses to help with decisions. And we\u2019ll be doing this same analysis.",

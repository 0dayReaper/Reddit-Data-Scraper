    "postText": "Hi! I got into Emerson for business of creative enterprises as an international student. I was wondering if anyone could share with me how the student life is (is it diverse, and are students usually welcoming toward international asian students that aren't asian american?) I understand Emerson probably has a smaller cohort than most schools(?), so how is the community like, and are the demographics mainly white?\n\nThank you! I really appreciate any help given. :)",

            "comment": "Hey, junior VMA student here. There are a surprisingly large number of international students from asia, there's even a club dedicated to asian students, both asian-american and international, so the short answer is yes, the student body is very welcoming to international students. Demographics are still mainly white, but it's still pretty decently diverse. Community is welcoming, but it does have a tendency to devolve into everyone just staying in their cliques (myself included). Overall, you'll find your friends, both fellow international students and American students alike, you just gotta look around for them.",

                    "comment": "hey! I see. thanks for the insight! but from the general Emerson culture/what you see, would you say its easy to make friends there? I guess one of my concerns is just not being able to click or find a group of friends to be able to mix around with (and not just restricting myself to fellow international asian students hahaha). On top of that, since its a city campus, is it hard to mix around (even between diff majors/buildings?) - is there also a sense of school spirit despite this? thanks so much for your help btw :&gt;",

            "comment": "Hey, fellow BCE, welcome to the fold. I'm very much in agreement with Sk8erclone - There's a large international student body, through the demo is fairly white at Emerson. The community is pretty much work and interest based cliques, but depending on where you live, there may also be some building socialising - 2B and Little are both generally social buildings. The org for asian students is [ASIA](https://emconnect.emerson.edu/organization/asia), and they generally have a bunch of events during the year. You can poke them on EmConnect if you want to get involved before you're on campus.",

                    "comment": "hello! thank you :) oo I see! I have some other questions for you if that's okay - \n\nI was also just wondering how do you find the BCE program? I thought it was really interesting but I was also scared that (correct me if im wrong) it may be a bit \"restrictive\" in a sense that its business for the creative economy specifically and not general business per say - I kinda want to be able to keep my options open for when I work in the future (but of course I do have a lot of interest in media/advertising/the creative economy) but do you think the course is flexible in that sense?   \n\n\nAlso, how is the sense of school spirit and acceptance/friendliness toward international asian students? For example just like mixing with different people of different races and friend groups all that - I guess I'm just a little concerned about making friends and all (that arent just limited to international asian students like me haha) and the diversity of the school life in general.\n\nthank you for your help in advance! :&gt;",

                            "comment": "I'm on the way out, and I'll say this much - my opinion of the BCE program is currently marred by the whole \"Global Pandemic\" part - I was geared up to have a killer end of my time here, but now I'm stuck at home finishing up classes online, very far removed from my partner organisation for BC451.  \n  \n  In terms of classes at Emerson, you won't find a more flexible curricula than BCE, except for maybe making your own program as part of [IDIP](https://www.emerson.edu/academics/schools-labs-and-centers/institute-liberal-arts-interdisciplinary-studies/interdisciplinary-major/idip-application-process). In my time here I took theatre classes, digital design classes, esports management classes, and marketing classes. Your options really open up once you take Aesthetic Perspective with P. Carl, his class counts as a prerequisite for about *half* of the course catalogue. You can also take E3 to get more of an entrepreneurship perspective, and you can roll that into your minor, as well. You can totally discuss your track with your advisor, or faculty advisors especially - I had Brenna, who did a great job working with me to set up stuff for what I was interested in.  \n  \n  In terms of the spirit/acceptance/friendliness - your mileage may vary, and no-one's experience is exactly the same, but in general, Emerson is reasonably diverse and accepting, it's honestly just more dependant on your living situation and what kind of creative communities or orgs you join.  I have a fair number of friends internationally, but that's just my experience.  Honestly, if you get involved with some orgs and be social in the major and in the buildings, you should have no problems making friends.",

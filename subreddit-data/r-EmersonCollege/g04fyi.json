I took an array of journalism courses, including ENG/TV News Reporting, Health &amp; Medical Reporting, Environmental Reporting, Advanced Audio-Video Journalism, Law for Journalists, Ethics for Journalists, Beat Reporting, among others. All of the classes I took get you out in the field and teach you how to be a one-woman band, meaning you know how to use a camera, be on camera, write a script, edit a package, etc. One of the highlights of my time in the program was getting to go to Japan with my senior journalism capstone class. Our professor secured 100% funding for us to go during spring break and we produced an ebook. \n\nClubs / Extra curricular activities are at the heart of Emerson. I would say that almost every student is involved in at least one. There are soo many to choose from. Personally, I was most involved with WEBN and J-Channel, which are both broadcast news organizations. Through WEBN, I reported at MLB Spring Training in Florida. They also send students to the Emmys, the Superbowl, political caucuses and of course, report on local news. \n\nThose are just some brief highlights. I truly can't say enough about my time at Emerson. It was such a meaningful and productive experience for me.  \n\n\nCongratulations! I hope you love it there!",

            "comment": "Compared to other top end film schools (nyu, usc, lmu, chapman) Emerson has a very large, broad program comparatively, which leads to some good and some bad. The good is you\u2019ll meet a wide variety of people with similar interests and the environment is extremely collaborative, a far cry from some of the more cutthroat schools like nyu. Because of how unspecialized the major is, you end up with a student body that has a ton of broad experience across various departments; you kind of inevitably learn a bit of everything. Thats said, this also means pretty much the first two years here are so surface level you\u2019re unlikely to learn anything from course content, frankly your 100 and 200 level classes will mostly feel like a waste of time and a distraction from the extracurricular student sets you\u2019ll actually be learning from. And thats not even to mention Emerson\u2019s abysmal liberal arts requirements, which take up a huge bulk of your course load. \n\nGear wise, the EDC (and other resources) at Emerson have some pretty great gear you get access too. Not top top end, some is pretty old, but more than enough for student productions. I just shot my thesis on Emerson\u2019s Cannon C300 and it looks great. You won\u2019t find an Arri Alexa at the edc, but frankly few undergrad projects at Emerson would justify that kind of gear anyhow. \n\nAlso worth noting, Emerson union busts the teachers and students and hikes tuition 5-8% every year while the top salaries inflate wildly and no changes are made for the benefit of the student body. So that\u2019s also worth considering.",

    "postText": "My daughter got into Tisch school of Arts (NYU) and also got into Emerson.\n\nShe is leaning towards Tisch.  But wants to hear from others. Perhaps current/ former students of Emerson can chime in and provide some input please.  \n\nWe have gone to both campuses but during these times of covid going to see campuses is useless.  There are no tours and no face to face meetings.  We just walked aimlessly around campuses. \n\nThen we are expected to go home and make a $75k/year decision based on limited information.  \n\nIf you were in my daughters shoes, which of the 2 would you pick ? Why?\n\nthanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Both are great schools. Here are a few points of comparison that might be helpful: \n\n\\- I have a friend who went to Emerson and transferred because she found it too specific. Though she went there loving the arts-focus, she got there and regretted that she did not have the chance to explore other interests. She ended up transferring to a bigger school so she would have a wider range of foreign language and history classes.  At NYU, this would not have been a problem because it's part of a big university where there are a lot more options. \n\n\\- On the other hand, I know another person who preferred Emerson because NYU has a more stringent liberal arts core requirement. \n\n\\- Another thing to consider is location and campus-type. Does your daughter like Boston or New York better?  Would she do better in a  small campus community or would she thrive in big, diverse university? \n\n\\--Compare the required courses.  I'm always amazed by people who chose schools without doing this.  Even though majors may sound similar, they vary a lot by school. \n\n\\- Have her take a look at the faculty for the courses she would be taking. Which ones seem more experienced and aligned with her interests? \n\nGood luck with her decision!",

Emerson isn\u2019t cheap, but they gave me much better scholarships than tisch. Honestly the attitude i received in correspondences with each school made a big impact in my choice. When corona hit I really needed more money to go to either school. Emerson right away offered me an additional 8k a year, meanwhile NYU implied that i was entitled for even asking. I didn\u2019t want to fight with that type of toxicity whenever interacting with school management so i ended up picking Emerson. Also, despite NYU\u2019s rep, emerson is FAR better at landing students jobs because of their alumni program.",

Have you actually conducted a study of relative financial aid? What data do you have about the alumni program?  How do you know Tisch operates based on reputation? f you have facts, definitely share them. Facts are helpful. Sniping not.",

Emerson has a program set up that makes contacting and working with Emerson alumni much easier, and the smaller size means that networking connections can be made much closer: a few reliable friends is better than a hundred acquaintances.\n\nI also have multiple classmates who were accepted into NYU, and even if they were both pretty paltry with fin aid, NYU is more likely to not give any money at all whereas Emerson will at least offer some sort of need-based compensation, which they can do because there are less students to take care of.\n\nSize matters, but not in the way people think.\n\nEDIT: added fin aid blurb",

Emerson is also awful with financial aid and runs on reputation, and if OP's daughter wants industry connections, they'll have a much easier time in New York than in Boston. \n\nOverall, you seem to be pretty biased towards Emerson (as a straight white man, that makes sense), and I would consider looking further into how this school treats anyone who *isn't* that.",

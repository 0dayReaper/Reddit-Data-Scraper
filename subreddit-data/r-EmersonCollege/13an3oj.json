    "postText": " My son is thinking of transferring to either Emerson or USC for film. He\u2019s currently at another local Boston area college so staying in Boston for Emerson would not be as disruptive as transferring to USC into Junior year.  On the flip side USC is supposed to be \u201chigher ranked\u201d (whatever that means)  and super plugged into LA. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on how to balance this?  (he's also really not sure).",

            "comment": "As an Emerson mom and Los Angeles native I\u2019m familiar with both schools. First USC is called \u201cUniversity of Spoiled Children\u201d for a reason. Also they are very specific and pedantic with their program, and if your child differs in the slightest they will have a hard time.  Emerson is very accepting of different points of view regarding what is art. It\u2019s really the old guard (USC) vs the new guard (Emerson) of Hollywood film makers. That being said he should go to USC and sit in on a few classes. It might be his thing. I personally don\u2019t think USC has the prestige it use to have, but that\u2019s just me. My kid is thriving at Emerson and I don\u2019t think he would have had the same opportunities at USC so I\u2019m completely biased \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "I would agree with cbdwitch. Went to USC for theater and yes, by virtue of living in Los Angeles, you\u2019re plugged in, just like if your interest is politics going to school in DC is advantageous. However, Emerson has a tight internship program and is very tied in to Los Angeles. Their Los Angeles live/work/intern community is strong at the building on Sunset. I would also agree with the \u201cold guard\u201d vs. \u201cnew guard\u201d analogy regarding what is allowed and how much creativity a student has to experiment and be outside the box at USC. Now, with the Daniels and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d and the Oscar accolades, I have no doubt next year\u2019s applications will see a huge bump. Not that Emerson isn\u2019t already an amazing school. It is one of the top film schools and in the top 10. I also think Emerson\u2019s small size, close community and collaborative environment make it a great contender, but he should certainly check out USC to be sure.",

            "comment": "I have a feeling USC will look at a lot better on a resume and is 100x connections wise. I graduated Emerson and did enjoy my time there. Ultimately the industry connections felt a bit weak 10 years ago as it was mostly PAs and Producer Assistants but it was better than where I transferred from (University of Kansas). Also Boston just sucks in the winter so if had an opportunity to live in SoCal id go for that. The LA semester for Emerson was a joke in my opinion. The best professors for Emerson were back in Boston. I fortunately ended up with a very good internship at a CBS TV Show during that time because of the Emerson connection but I was lucky as most of my classmates internships were C quality production companies. But 10 years has past so I have an old perspective (except for the weather)",

The advantage was being in LA and getting that head start auditioning for film and tv. Casting directors wanted to know if you were studying with the popular acting teachers of the day and honing your craft. Granted, this was years ago. It\u2019s like being a dancer, you have to be in class all the time.",

Film companies don\u2019t care about your degree - it\u2019s just paper.  They want skills and experience.  Begin working in the industry today - don\u2019t wait.  Take jobs that don\u2019t pay - make connections and earn respect.",

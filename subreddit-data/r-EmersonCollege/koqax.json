We took cans of glow-in-the-dark hairspray and a bunch of hallucinogens one night and 'light-painted' all of room 1127. The RA's arrived INS-style busting through the door and turned the lights on. It was amazing. As soon as they turned the lights on, there was no evidence that we did anything at all -- there was no dark for the paint to glow in. I hope some other kid in room 1127 many years later just buys a blacklight like 'hehe fuck yeah college' and turns it on for the first time and sees my light dragon's face staring back at him around the windows and ceiling.",

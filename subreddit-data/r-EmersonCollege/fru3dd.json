    "postText": "I'm an NEU student but I'm also working on a story for the Boston Globe about students staying on campus and what it's like now that most schools are essentially shut down and I'm hoping to speak to people who're still around. I'd also be interested in talking to someone who tried to petition the university to stay and was denied. You can email me at [zipporah.osei@globe.com](mailto:zipporah.osei@globe.com) or message me here. Thanks!",

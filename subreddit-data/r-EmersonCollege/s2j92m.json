It seems the College has gone forward without polling members of the community with what they want/feel comfortable with for the semester ahead. How do you feel?",

I'd check around with folks on-campus if there's still any access - I know they also used their [website](https://ecstudentunion.home.blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecstudentunion) sparingly.\n\n\n\nI was kind of distantly part of ECSU when I was at Emerson? But I stopped working with them over some political stuff, I wasn't interested in explicitly Maoist organising.",

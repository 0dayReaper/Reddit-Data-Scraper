I don't know the specific probability, but you really don't get much of a say. housing will assign you rooms and that's basically where you'll be for the year (unless you wanna change bc roommate problems, etc.). im pretty sure there's only doubles facing the Common (with suites on the corners), but there might be triples facing Tremont. hope this helps!",

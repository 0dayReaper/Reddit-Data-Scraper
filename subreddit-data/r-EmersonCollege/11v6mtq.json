            "comment": "Congrats on your acceptance. Emerson doesn't have any kind of on-campus housing for grad students. Undergrad room &amp; board comes out to $2000+ per month anyway (even in a double or triple) so if you're looking to save money dorms wouldn't be the way to go. \n\nLiving in East Boston or Allston and commuting in by T are popular options for students (I lived in Allston during my undergrad) but you should expect a 20-40 min train ride depending on where you end up.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm planning on transferring to Emerson for production in film and I'm stuck between a few schools. This would be my second year in college and I haven't done anything film related yet in school. If anyone could provide their thoughts on Emerson and their experience at this school, that would definitely help me out in deciding! Also, if anyone has any information or history with the Media Arts Production program, let me know! \n\nThank you!",

My main concern was access to gear, and while the gear the early and intro classes let you reserve is somewhat limited, you can do it whenever and as many times as you want. That was a real selling point for me.\n\nPeople are always making things and if you put yourself out there you will be asked to work on their projects. It\u2019s a very collaborative culture. There are serious problems with tuition and the amenities it affords us, but if you\u2019re motivated you can do well here.",

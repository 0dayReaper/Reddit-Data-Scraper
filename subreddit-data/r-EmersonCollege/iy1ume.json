    "postText": "Hi folks! It's your friendly (and, ***finally***, recently graduated!) mod Liam. Welcome to Fall 2020!\n\n\n\n\nIf you're an Old Reddit holdout, you may notice a fresh coat of paint on the Emerson sub! I've retooled our CSS so things look a little more modern and inviting. And, thanks to [Mercedes Lamb](https://twitter.com/littleartistan), we even have a lil Griff snoo. For folks using New Reddit - I've also tried my best to keep things looking nice &amp; up to date, despite my lack of interest in the new interface. Please let me know what you think! I'm open to any suggestions, and I've got a roster of new banners I'll be cycling through for the seasons. Contributions are also welcomed! Feel free to post your nice downtown pictures.\n\n\n\nYou can still find COVID updates in the sidebar - we've also got a link back to Emerson's official dashboard, or you can check my old post detailing the whole last semester and summer [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/EmersonCollege/comments/fir4px/its_corona_time_emerson_college_covid19_updates/). If you have any other questions, feel free to message me, mail me, or bother admin with your COVID questions.\n\n\n\n**I'm currently on the hunt for additional mods!** You may notice that the core mod team is no longer active on the sub, and given I've now graduated, it'd be nice to have someone else to carry the torch who actually *does* attend Emerson right now. As before - message or modmail me if you're interested, or - \n\n\n\n#[Join the Official Unofficial Emerson Discord!](https://discord.gg/gYxXgE4)  \n  \n  It's been great watching the community on the Discord expand, and the leadership core of the server is taking extremely good care of things! You can feel free to message or summon me on the server if you've got general Emerson questions, or questions about the subreddit - I'm such an insomniac that your chances of catching me are quite high, and I swear I don't bite!\n\n\n\nI think that's most of the bases covered - best of luck to everyone again on another ~~exciting (??) and fun-filled (???)~~ year at Emerson!",

My daughter is considering it and I am trying to figure out if there\u2019s any actual \u201ccampus\u201d to see if we take a trip to Boston (no tours being offered currently so checking out the inside of buildings doesn\u2019t seem to be an option.) She\u2019s totally open to an urban college experience!",

You\u2019re also a short walk from the Charles River Esplanade which is another great green space. These all made up for the lack of a traditional college campus for me personally. Hope this helped!",

            "comment": "There isn\u2019t really a campus in the traditional sense like you would see at a more rural located school. Remember, this is in the heart of Boston, and the campus is more of a collection of buildings in a 2-3 block radius. Common spaces are the campus library, campus food vendors (cafeteria, etc), designated meeting rooms, some lounges, and dorm common spaces. This is a similar situation with almost every college and university within Boston. Harvard and MIT do have their own green spaces, however they are much bigger schools, and not in Boston. \n\nWhat I will say, however is that the commons is right there, as is the public gardens. Newbury street is really close, and while not a park, it is a lovely street for shopping and lined with trees (check out Newbury comics). Commonwealth Ave is also really close and is kind of like a really long park in between two streets. The esplanade on the Charles is very close too. As an added bonus, easy subway access gives her a way to get to almost every park in the Boston area.\n\nEmerson is a city school at the end of the day, and in Boston, space is in high demand and comes at a premium. The commons is the closest thing to a quad Emerson students have. When I studied there, I did not miss having a school specific green space, however, I am very much a city person. If she\u2019s open to the urban college experience, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll feel the same as I did. I remember meeting friends on the commons for lunch or just to hang out very frequently. If she\u2019s into skateboarding, a lot of kids congregate on the commons on the corner of boyleston and tremont to practice.",

    "postText": "Is anyone here currently in or an alum of the MA/MFA in Theatre Ed and Applied Theatre? I applied for the coming fall and can find next to nothing about it online or on Emerson's social media. It seems like the perfect program for my career goals and Emerson has a great reputation, but I can't find anything about courses, production opportunities, alumni in the field, or anything really of use to me in making a decision. I'm starting to become suspicious of how little there is out there about it and I'm hoping someone on here can tell me a little bit more about their experience in the program, and what they're doing now with it.",

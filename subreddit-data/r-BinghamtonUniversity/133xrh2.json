Because of its accessible creation tools TikTok has become the prominent platform for short form digital storytelling. In this class, we will take an immersive dive into the TikTok ecosystem, and explore how the platform can be used to effectively narrativize your work, and to enhance your career goals. TikTok is not just about viral dance videos. The platform hosts thriving communities of amateurs and experts from nearly every profession, collaborating and communicating about their work through short, engaging films. Through the class, you will discuss critical perspectives and approaches to building visual narratives. You will learn how to make compelling content about your passions, and walk away with a portfolio of high quality, shareable TikToks that will showcase your digital storytelling skills to the world.\n\n**DIDA 210 - Digital Text Analysis**  \nThis course is an introduction of the methods and theory of quantitative analysis of documents and natural language processing. Students will learn to use modern tools and Python packages to analyze texts as individual words, sentences, and entire documents. Topics include part-of-speech tagging, sentence diagramming, machine translation, regular expressions, and sentiment analysis. Prior programming experience is useful but not expected. This course is geared toward students who are interested in using computational techniques to study works of literature, news reports, social media posts, song lyrics, or any other body of texts that might reveal meaningful historical, cultural, social or political patterns.\n\n**DIDA 130 - Introduction to Statistical Thinking**  \nStatistics is a powerful skill for students in any academic discipline. In this course, students will be introduced to basic statistical concepts, including probability, hypothesis testing, regression, and other foundational topics. No prior knowledge of statistics is required, and lessons will emphasize the application of statistical concepts and methods rather than mathematical theory. Topics will be presented using lectures, course readings, and hands-on, interactive activities using R statistical software, with respect to real-world examples of statistical research across the liberal arts.",

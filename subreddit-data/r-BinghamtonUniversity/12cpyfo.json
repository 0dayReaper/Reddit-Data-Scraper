    "postText": "Hi!\nI got into Watson college to study computer engineering last year, and successfully deffered my admission to this fall.\nI actually wanted to major in computer science, but my parents made me go for computer engineering instead.\nI was finally able to convince them to let me do computer science. I was wondering if I could switch majors before I resume in the fall, or if its something I have to do after I resume \nThanks!",

            "comment": "As you decide on your actions, I want to advise you that staying in the CoE program lends you significantly more career flexibility. Three years on, most of my classmates with a computer engineering major have actually settled into jobs in software development, if more aligned toward the systems programming end of things than, say, web applications. If you want to go on to get an MS in computer science, there is no issue staying in the engineering program, as the core classes are the same. You just won't be taking a class in OOP design patterns or other high-level topics that would be par for the CS sequence.\n\nIt's not a symmetric opportunity; a CS major cannot easily go into working with hardware. (It continues to amuse me the diffuculty programmers without a background in hardware have in grasping what a `for` loop in HDL does. It's not an iteration in series over time; it actually sets up simultaneous parallel datapaths iterating over a bit vector.) Personally, I set out wanting to be a CS major in high school. But after trying to take the engineering route to get into Carnegie Mellon because the acceptance rates were higher (I was still rejected), I realized that CoE was more my cup of tea anyway and I am ultimately happy for that twist of fate.",

CS is an incredibly broad field in itself and while there is overlap between CoE and CS it goes both ways. Of course cs majors don\u2019t go very in depth into hardware but at the same time computer engineering doesnt go very in depth into software. I\u2019m 100% sure both Careers have rabbit holes of information that go endlessly and provide many opportunities but there are definitely also many jobs an average BS in CoE couldn\u2019t do. (Also cs has a higher starting salary on average)",

Do NOT be discouraged to do what you want\u2014 people on campus kept telling me it was hard and you had to act a certain way to sway the department to let you in, but you should try if you don\u2019t feel like CoE is right for you. I feel like it is best if you speak with an advisor before the next semester because if you  wait to take cs classes next semester you may have to take some courses over breaks to fulfill the degree requirement. I\u2019ve been told that most people that go with engineering CoE especially just end up with a job coding lol",

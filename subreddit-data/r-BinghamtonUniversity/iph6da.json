No one would ever say either in lecture, or to the professor to their face that they are \"ridiculous\" or \"can't teach for their life\". The whole online thing is not easy for anyone and I understand we are all frustrated but let's be better and be respectful to the professors that are literally ALL trying to help you the best they can with this. Let's be adaptable and stay patient with this. And I know that all are not perfect but a vast majority are really trying their best to help us. ",

There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than watching a professor pause in the middle of an important point to read a message that he probably thinks is an important question, but its just a dumb reference to a meme. I don\u2019t care if the professor forces out a polite laugh; stop trying to be a comedian",

Instructors can request technology assistants who can help filter out the inappropriate material and let the professor know of any genuine questions. It is challenging to lecture and try to police a chat at the same time. If the professor knows that this is an issue then they can address the class/students. Also students please be advised that we save the chat every lecture and can see what people are writing. (And also how long you\u2019re in class for so don\u2019t be late!)",

Everyone is allowed to have their own thoughts/opinions about their professors and how they teach, I just really don't think the Zoom chat is the right place to air your grievances lol. A lot of professors are older too, and struggling with the technology; they're just as frustrated with being online as we are. My personal experience with this has been in an intro level math class with a lot of freshmen, so I'm just, like, assuming they think they can get away with bullying their college profs like they did their high school teachers. And I don't even wanna sound like a kiss-ass bc I've had my problems with professors too, but there's still a level of respect that everyone should be maintaining.",

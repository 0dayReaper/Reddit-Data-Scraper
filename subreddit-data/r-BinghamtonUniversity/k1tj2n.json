    "postText": "I see you. I\u2019m not even sure if this post is appropriate for this sub, but sometimes I feel really alone at Binghamton because I\u2019m the only one in my group of friends without a real place to go back to. They don\u2019t understand when I can\u2019t afford to eat, or pay rent. Or why my parents have never called to see how I\u2019m doing while we\u2019re doing something together.\n\nTo those of you who do not come from happy homes this holiday season, I see you. I hear you. You\u2019re not alone. This is something I\u2019ve really struggled with at Binghamton specifically. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me, no matter the time or place I will be there. I can\u2019t stand the thought of anyone else dreading winter break because they come from broken homes too. I\u2019m here for you. Seriously",

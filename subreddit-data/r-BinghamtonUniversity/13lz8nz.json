            "comment": "hi! i took 239 last fall and it wasn\u2019t bad. You\u2019re graded on two open notes tests (which were admittedly a little difficult bc they had rlly specific questions), a final paper abt the topic of your choice, and labs which are due each week. Pangalozzi was pretty easy to reach thru office hours, but sort of hard to reach by email at times. I\u2019d say if you put a normal anount of work in her class you\u2019ll be fine :))",

    "postText": "Incoming freshman here, man those meal plans are expensive...\n\n1. \\*\\*Are you allowed to buy meals from on-campus places without a meal plan?\n2. If you live in a residential community other than Hillside/Susquehanna, is it mandatory to get a meal plan?\n3. If not, how doable is it to buy groceries off campus and cook meals in the community kitchens in the residential halls? I don't have a car btw\n4. Are the community kicthens good/usable, and are they always busy?\n5. Any help for choosing a Meal Plan (A, B, C, D, E, or F)? How hard is it to budget if you're trying to eat 3 healthy meals a day and splurge on snacks every so often?  \n\n\nEdit: Thank you guys, all your comments have been super helpful! ",

If you already have the meal plan, it\u2019s much cheaper to add funds then use the plan to pay. If you\u2019re a commuter, you have to eat frequently to break even on the plan. I think it was 12 meals a week last I calculated it for me. I only get the commuter meal plan because I have a grant that allows me to write it off.\n\nYou can pay with a card at the marketplace or concessions restaurants, it\u2019s the same price either way.",

            "comment": "1. Because you are a freshman, you will be mandated to get a meal plan. That meal plan will then allow you to get food from on-campus places like the dining halls or Marketplace.\n2. If you're not in the apartments, then you are mandated to get a meal plan.\n3. It's not hard, more so time-lengthy to get groceries. There are buses that go to big grocery stores like Wegmans and Walmart, but they come at specific times, so you have to keep track of that.\n4. Community kitchens are good depending in what residential building you're in. For instance, Hinman has tiny kitchens compared to Newing and Mountainview. They're somewhat busy at times. If that bothers you, I wouldn't recommend cooking in them all the time and possibly balancing out some days with food from the dining halls/Marketplace and some days when you make food yourself.\n5. I had the C meal plan, which I believe gets automatically applied to you and I found myself in a tight situation at the end of the semester since I would blow through the meal plan with Marketplace meals which cost more than $9. Of course, drinks and such are less there, but you get the point. The standard amount you should spend a day on a C meal plan is around 8 dollars, which I find nearly impossible at times. I would recommend getting one of the smaller meal plans so that you can familiarize yourself with the food options on campus and see how often you'd truly eat that food and then adjust the amount of money you'd like to have after.",

It def depends how much you eat and what items you decide to get frequently. My eating/ spending was def very sparratic tho, where some days i ate 3 meals and snacked and some days i ate next to nothing or cooked.",

            "comment": "Yes the meal plan is expensive however it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the cost of food is much lower. For example a burger is like $2. It is mandatory for all residential halls besides the apartments however you can reduce your plan to the smallest amount and then focus more on cooking for yourself if you\u2019d like. Buses leave to Walmart, target, and wegmans frequently but personally I like to use instacart to save the time and energy it would take to use the bus and lug groceries back. My freshman year I stuck with the C plan and it was the perfect amount for me who usually has a light breakfast and got marketplace or NOWL about 1-2 times a week. The good news is they don\u2019t charge a fee or anything to add more money to the plan so don\u2019t worry about getting a plan that\u2019s too small you can always add more to your account.",

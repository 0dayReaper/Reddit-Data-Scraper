I then chose to do accounting which is probably much better in Binghamton and Stony Brook. If you are still choosing between which schools, you should decide what major you would want to pursue in first. I believe Stony Brook is much better for STEM and Binghamton is decent for their business majors.",

If I decide on chem, it's for sure stony, and if i decide on analytics, it's gonna be bing. So it's all up to the majors at this point since the schools are equally good to me. I just don't know which route would bring more opportunities because a bit worried about tech oversaturation so I thought majoring in chemistry while learning coding on my own could give me an advantage... but really not sure",

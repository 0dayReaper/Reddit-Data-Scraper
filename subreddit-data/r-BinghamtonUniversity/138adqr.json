    "postText": "I am a new PhD student looking for housing in the Binghamton area. I would really prefer a 1 bedroom apartment and I know this is more expensive but my budget is pretty high. I will also have a car so that is not an issue either. Does anyone know of places that still have availability or have any suggestions of good places? I am really nervous that a lot of places are filled up by now for an August move in. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",

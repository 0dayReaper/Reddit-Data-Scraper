Dickinson storages are all full so I need to find somewhere off campus. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? \n\n(I don\u2019t have a car, so preferably somewhere not too far away)\n\nAlso if anyone has any experience renting a storage unit, what was it like? I\u2019ve never rented one before so it would be nice to know what to expect.",

When you get a meal plan, you pay a membership fee that offsets Sodexo\u2019s other expenses including the labor costs, maintenance on the dining halls, and shrinkage when people steal the overpriced chicken tenders.\n\nIf you pay with a card, you haven\u2019t paid that membership fee, so they add the surcharge. New York State also requires them to add a sales tax to retail purchases. Thus your 80% premium.",

Again I'm not entirely sure but that's my guess. I rarely ever eat on campus and I haven't had a meal plan since freshman year.",

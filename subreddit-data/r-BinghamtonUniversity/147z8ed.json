            "comment": "Transfer housing is not guaranteed. Basically you put your name on a waitlist and pray something opens up, it happens but is unlikely. Usually things open due to people transfer out/going abroad/moving off campus. All these things are unlikely though this close to the start of the semester.  Your best bet is to look into uclub which is a 10 minute walk from campus (has a direct trail) and a bus that only services uclub to campus and leaves uclub every 30 minutes.",

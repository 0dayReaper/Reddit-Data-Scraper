    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a high school senior who was recently admitted into the Binghamton Advantage Program (BAP). Binghamton is my first choice, however I received scholarships from other schools such as UAlbany which covers almost 80% of my tuition. Should I consider attending BAP as Bing is my number one choice or forgo it for the more financially-viable options.",

If they cover 80% of tuition (no housing etc) but it's only for the first year or two and contingent on you living on campus or something, that's a totally different story. \n\nAlways read the fine print!",

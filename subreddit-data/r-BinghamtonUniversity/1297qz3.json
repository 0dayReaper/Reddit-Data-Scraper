    "postText": "Incoming freshman here, just got accepted into Bing (Harpur) a few days ago for the Spring '24 semester, and I'm planning on majoring for Art History, specifically the degree in Architecture and Urban Studies. Bing is honestly my dream school and I'm grateful that I got in, but I'm still kind of worried about going to a university and not majoring in a STEM field, even though Art History really is something I'm highly interested in.\n\nI've been trying to find more information on just what the major there is like in general, as info on it online is dumb sparse. What's the art department at Bing like and is there anything I should look out for? I've heard it's a decent department, but at the same time I haven't attended yet, so I'm not really sure what to make of all this lol.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated lmaoooo",

If your heart is set on architecture, UB has a BS Arch degree feeding into an accredited M.Arch program. City College in NYC has an accredited B.Arch program.",

So if you get here and find that Art History isn't your thing, you can transfer to another department within Harpur relatively easily.  What are you career goals post graduation?",

Pretty much all the professors are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and there\u2019s a variety of specialties in the department including some architectural historians. For the degree you do have to take a little bit of math, drawing and physics, so I think you probably get a little bit of a taste of the practicalities of architecture? There\u2019s not many art history majors at Bing but the program is very tight knit since it is small and it\u2019s very easy to get to know professors. Also I like that the degree allows you some leeway so you can explore other areas of art history and you\u2019ll most likely be in a lot of other types of classes for gen ed\u2019s, which will help you decide if you want to transfer. I think it\u2019s good if you\u2019re not 100% decided on architecture, and to me a year or two extra of grad school if you do go that path doesn\u2019t seem like the end of the world.",

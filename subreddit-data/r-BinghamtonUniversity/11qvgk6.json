I\u2019d agree with the other commenter that you may want to look at other social groups. But the sororities will have rushing events where you can meet the other girls and get a gauge on how accepting they are.",

I don\u2019t know about a sorority that\u2019s known for inclusion however if you are looking for community you may want to consider some of the LGBT organizations. I\u2019m not saying sororities can\u2019t be great experiences for some, but it can also be stressful and difficult. Consider looking outside of just Greek life.",

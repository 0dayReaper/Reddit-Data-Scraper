If so, and you've already sent your transcripts over, you should be able to see whether or not it's checked off.\n\nEDIT: Had to update my app to read the caption. You should be fine to have it fulfilled. This list is more of like an \"or,\" list, meaning if you meet at least one of the qualifications, you should have it completed. Check DW if you want to be sure.",

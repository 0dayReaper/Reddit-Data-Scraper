    "postText": "VP for Student Affairs Brian Rose's most recent COVID email ends as follows:\n\n\"Be a member of our campus community and not just a consumer of our services. I think you'll find the rewards are worth the effort.\"\n\nI have read some variation on this sentiment -- \"we're all in this together!\" -- at least a dozen times in official administration correspondence over the past few months, and I'm fed up with BU peppering us with what is at best a misleading platitude and at worst an intentional papering over of the real reason we're all in Binghamton right now, which is that the school doesn't want to lose  money. So, real quick, let's make something crystal clear: **we are not all in this together.** The burden of risk, be that financially, academically, or with regard to our physical and mental health, rests almost entirely on the student body, and has neither been mitigated nor seemingly considered all that much by those with the power to make decisions.\n\nConsider, for instance, the differences between your lives and the lives of BU faculty and upper level staff. Overwhelmingly, administrators and professors get to go home at night to a house with at most a few other people in it, where they can control their interpersonal interactions and enjoy the safety that comes with high individual autonomy. Administrators and professors get to spend time socializing with their families, unencumbered by the demands of a faceless provost guilt tripping them from the moral high ground once a week in their email inboxes. Administrators and professors don't have to worry about where their next paycheck is coming from, don't have to utilize the woefully inadequate university health system to get access to basic mental health resources four months after they request it, don't have to pay *full tuition* for mostly online classes, don't have to pay rent in Binghamton because they're forced (read: given the opportunity!) to go to one token in-person lab a month, don't have to go to a public dining hall to eat, don't have to sit alone in on-campus housing on threat of being forcibly removed while still holding thousands in housing debt, don't have to do any of the inane bullshit hoop jumping that is being asked of a group of mostly 18-25 year olds. BU administration gets to sit in their offices and, bathed in the collective warmth of their pretension and financial security, tell us we aren't doing enough to stop the spread because some frat boys threw a party.\n\nI don't know about the rest of you, but I have to take 16 credit hours, mostly alone and online, before working 25 hours a week at a grocery store so I can pay for my apartment full of contact starved coeds and *full priced* tuition. I have to worry about my financial security, I have to worry about my physical and mental health so I can have some of that financial security, I have to pay exactly the same as I did last year for classes that are being taught through a webcam, and, oh yeah, *my entire future is riding on this.* You want compliance, VP Rose? This is a two way street. I want some tuition money back, I want my friends in the dorms to be able to get out of their insanely overpriced housing contracts, I want in-person classes cancelled so that people have the option of getting the hell out of here, and, more than anything else, I want an acknowledgement that the student body is being asked to bear the entirety of this load with *zero* slack. We are here right now because the college is worried about its solvency, full stop. Cut the bullshit about the benefits of in-person learning, cut the bullshit about our new shared reality. There is no benefit to us sitting alone in our apartments away from friends and family while we stare at a Zoom screen and worry about how we're going to pay rent without getting sick. You get to collect a paycheck and go home at night to your family. You're the one benefitting here.\n\nThe administration has acted in bad faith for a year now. It deserves every ounce of bad press it gets.",

For the record, I have an immense amount of sympathy for students whose social activities were cut short in service of keeping some courses in-person. That's bullshit, and a thinly veiled attempt to keep X number of tuition payers happy to have an in-person component, while undercutting the social and mental health of countless others. My heart hurt for UGs when I read that email. \n\nGrad students are currently fighting for our student fees (that is, the approx. 20% of our measly income that we have to pay back to the university to contribute to services almost none of us utilize) to be reduced or eliminated during the pandemic. We had an action day wherein many of us wrote in to campus administrators, attesting to the burden these fees place on us. The response from the provost DN was a veritable \"FU, nice try.\" We are furious. We are with you. This administration is treating its graduate workers poorly as well, and we really hear students when you air these frustrations. I feel quite resentful about this treatment especially considering, as you said, many administrators get to go home to their families at the end of the day while students are often unable to see theirs. \n\nThis was not especially meant to be a helpful post, more a solidarity and keep speaking up post (and perhaps a be kind to your graduate TAs post). Your UG years should be spent learning ang growing as people, not being treated like a burden on the university to which you pay tuition. I'm sorry this has been your experience.",

Or our office have not closed.  We continue to work and serve students.   Faculty and staff are being asked, once again, to do more with less - less people, less money, and less support.     \n\nThe employees here are burnt.  They are working, while trying to take care of their elderly and immuno-comprised family members.  They are trying to take care of their children and manage their schooling - usually while working full time because the schools have not opened.  And they are still doing so while expecting to do their jobs. \n\nMany people are livng in households that have expanded since the pandemic started because jobs have been blown out of the water.   Adult children (and their families) have moved back in with their parents.   Aging parents have moved in with their children.   Employees are not going back to peaceful homes at the end of the day - they are going back to homes that have been impacted by the pandemic in a financially stressed area. \n\nThis is not a cakewalk for anyone at all.",

And I dont think they realize how unprepared everyone was to deal with this. You cant say \"well the administration expected 18-25 year olds to comply thats dumb\" you willingly agreed to be here. Instead of condeming a system that is trying its best (I will admit there are a lot of faults in it) say why the fuck are college educated ADULTS not thinking of others and following simple rules. 18-25 is not a child anymore, stop blaming being young and act like an adult by thinkng of other people and taking responsibility for your own actions.",

The small subset of people who are not complying are never going to think of others. If they did, this wouldnt be happening. There needs to be consequences, from THE ADMINISTRATION. Saying \"we're doing all we can\" when you clearly arent and then essentially telling students to pick up their bootstraps and do their job is assinine. I know 0 people involved in any of this shit. What am I supposed to do, walk into a frat and tell them to stop? The admin is intimately connected with BPD, they could stop this if they wanted to, or just did their jobs. Most people are not connected to this stuff in any way, and we are the ones suffering.\n\nAlso, this is one thing on a very long list of things this place has fucked up. People in quarantine are literally starving due to incompetence. Yes, the testing here is top tier, good job on them for that. But most else is MUCH worse than similar places, not everything can be chalked up to \"everywhere is struggling.\" Brian Rose's email is absolutely indefensible, and these people are in no way doing all they can, especially given their salaries.

Let's briefly imagine the consequences if the university went full remote for the year with a huge tuition discount (which the OP proposes as a magic bullet). The uni would lose a year of housing revenue (-9% of the budget) and at, say, a half-price discount for remote learning, would lose another -20% of its budget (conservatively). The state cut appropriations to SUNY this year bc of COVID budget problems, that's another -5%. Super roughly, that's a $120 million shortfall. Would I have managed this situation exactly as the admin has done? No. Do I think upper admin is paid too much and should take big paycuts in solidarity? Yes.  But even if you cut top admin salaries by half or more, you'd get, what? 2% of the total budget shortfall back? (Harvey, the highest paid person, makes half a million a year....sorry, you just can't find $120 million in 'bloat at the top'). You're still looking at an almost 1/3 drop in the uni's budget for two years and, in a non-profit organization where most of the expenses are salary, that means tons of people would get fired (or furloughed for months and months), starting with cafeteria workers and campus electricians and moving up through junior faculty members (with massive ripple effects for these peoples' families in the city and county). The university looked at this situation and chose three semesters of messed up, stressful hybrid learning instead of turning a bunch of its long-term employees out onto the streets. Full remote at a huge discount would be great for students (well, for students who are in situations where remote learning works), and I understand why the OP is fantasizing about it being some perfect solution. But it would have huge human costs for the institution and the surrounding community. Maybe you think that's worth a tuition break? Fine. But don't pretend full remote would be free. You're just suggesting moving all the costs onto someone else.",

Nobody wants thousands of people to lose their jobs. We are talking about fixing what is currently plaguing the student body. Right now students are paying 10s of thousands of dollars to receive what amounts to a poor education, a poor living environment, and Brian Rose's wonderful emails. Employees and faculty are also suffering btw.\n\nWe are paying to be here. We are paying for an education, a safe environment to live, and the ability to receive certification from an accredited institution, provided you fullfill the requirements deemed necessary by external professional associations or the field at large. If the university fails to deliver on any of these, it is not up to us to continue supporting it, nor to argue for others to continue their support. \n\nThe problems the student body is facing are legitimate and need resolution. If the university cannot address these issues in the way that other similar universities have and continue to, then it shouldn't remain solvent. At the end of the day, whatever its technical classification may be, it is a business, and when others can provide better services at the same cost, the business will fold. If they would not like this to happen, maybe the administration should show SOME visible effort and quit with the flowery bullshit. People know things here are bad, stop telling us that they arent and not to whine in patronizing emails. I was here through undergrad, the university continually chose to spend on vanity projects rather than investing in faculty and students. If this is the end, they dug their own grave.\n\nAnd no, it is not the end. These people will fight tooth and nail to preserve this place if they have to. It is very possible to both address the concerns of students, faculty, and employees, AND remain solvent. They need pushing, which is what we're trying to do. Why pay full tuition for content many times worse than is available for free online? Why pay for full room and board when you are essentially evicted with 4 days notice (hillside) in the middle of a pandemic? If the university cannot remedy these issues then it's on them. Other places do this, and they aren't all ivys. Besides, isn't this place always claiming its status as a public ivy? Earn it.",

In other words, the university already \\*started\\* the year having to find a 10% reduction in spending because of the dorm refunds and the state pulling funding (they found this $ through pulling research funding from faculty and instituting a hiring freeze--in a moment of intensified retirement a freeze is a way to shrink the workforce without firing people). [https://www.bupipedream.com/news/117502/auto-draft-298/](https://www.bupipedream.com/news/117502/auto-draft-298/)\n\nAll faculty and staff salaries are public, because again, this is a non-profit org subject to transparency laws. You could get some wiggle room from cutting top admin salaries, sure, but not much: [https://www.seethroughny.net/payrolls](https://www.seethroughny.net/payrolls)\n\n90% of the university's budget goes to staff and faculty salaries/benefits (health insurance etc), which you can read about here: [https://www.binghamton.edu/president/budget-faq.html](https://www.binghamton.edu/president/budget-faq.html)\n\nEnjoy!",

I'm glad you actually posted this. I'm going to look through this more later. While the budget is tight, I dont think things are completely set in stone. The people receiving the highest pay here can easily handle a pay cut. Also, if the administration doesnt want to be run out of town by an angry mob, it would probably be in their best interest to actually do that. It wouldnt help significantly, but several million dollars isnt nothing, and their image desperately needs some rehabilitation. I think for some of them this is too late, if Brian Rose was at all competent he would have seen that email was a horrible move. Same with how the provost handled the recent GSEU issue. There has to be people out there who can do a better job. Even just not being a prick would help.\n\nSecond, one way or another, the budget will have to change here. Look at this thread: no one here is going to ever recommend their friends to come to this place. Why? The price is too high for the current quality of what is being received. Bad publicity can kill. They need to be more accommodating towards students if they still want people to come here. Otherwise, even the predict dropoff in student enrollment is going to be too conservative. Less students, less revenue. Personally, I think one answer that actually could work during covid is this: stop treating Sunys as individual schools. Because we're in a single system, why not have zoom lectures be broadcast to more than one school at a time, by professors who are known to be good teachers? Then the individual schools can use grad students for what they're meant for, 1-1 help with students and grading, instead of running the whole course themselves when often they are very incompetent due to ZERO training and support. If people get a better education to begin with, a lot of the complaints about the current fees could go away. Just spitballing, who knows if this ever could get through the beurocracy, or would actually help the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, layoffs, pay cuts and wage freezes are going to happen. What matters more is how they go about this. I am employed here, and have been here for 7 years now. I know a lot that has gone on, and money at this place has often been squandered on some really ridiculous and unneeded projects, and positions artificially created. Just by being a bit more pragmatic they can change things, even if that happens in the future. At the very least, they need to aim to lower fees to at least pre covid levels. Look at the guy who wanted to donate a multi million dollar endowment, but specified it HAD to be used on a Baseball stadium. I honestly dont know if we even have a team here. \n\nHow this will be done will have to be fleshed out. I dont know a lot of details currently, but I'm willing to learn and work with the administration. As I said, over the next few days I'm going to go through what you posted and try to see. All I'm saying is I dont think we should be treating anything as impossible right now, we should negotiate and try to improve what we can. I think I'm not going to post here directly though, I've already written like 3 essays on here that no one wants to read lol. Anyways, maybe not the admin, but the rest of us are on the same team here, let's work together. Dm me if you'd like to discuss more.",

A curfew means students would have to be in their own dorm by a certain time\n3. All campus activities are canceled and no on campus jobs run past 12 so there is no reason for students to be out\n4. Libraries and other study areas also close well before that time\n5. Most greek life pledges are sophomores/freshman who live on campus so this would stop in person pledging from occurring which is just going to get worse and more frequent in the following weeks\n\nNote: this is just a thought not a complete idea I understand there may be limitations to this",

Our school is roughly 3X worse at containing covid than pretty much anyone else in SUNY. Now, keep in mind, there are students at all of those other schools that don't have the resources to isolate too. But you know what those schools don't have? A massive population of daddys money long islander narcissistic fratboy headasses with no regard for their impact on the binghamton community.\n\nI'm actually biased, because i kind of need in person classes. I really struggle online. I don't think i'm the only person either. All i want is to be able to sit in person in a 15 person class and do math for an hour 3 times a week in the basement of whitney hall. I really don't think the in person classes are the huge issue here. Its the fact that they opened up the res halls and brought the morons back into the county to save a couple thousand dollars.",

I'm going to try as hard as possible to transfer after the pandemic subsides (because the last thing I want is to transfer to another zoom university). The shit I have put up with through this is ridiculous. Grad student tas are NOT supposed to run entire courses, but guess what I have been doing since the pandemic started? And no, this is not normal. Ask how many universities have grad students teaching 200 level STEM courses before they even get their masters.\n\nI have a friend who started in the fall, and after a faculty member became ill with covid, was immediately told to fill in for everything the faculty member did. Or \"hes not made for this and will be cut.\" \n\nSame thing happened with me. We're supposed to just be an extra \"supplement\" for the course, and the kids are supposed to learn from watching videos. Yeah fucking right. Or, we're told to just have you guys present your homework. This is why half of your guys courses are horrible, we are asked not to teach you. I run absolutely everything, the only thing I dont do is make the exam. I'm not a ta, I'm a fucking professor. And I get paid a poverty level wage. Please tell me how I'm supposed to spend 40 hours a week running this course, take 3 courses, because if I dont I'm not \"full time\" and will lose my stipend, and do research? Yeah, I'm not supposed to. I'm not supposed to teach, I'm supposed to not do anything like half the people here and watch all of my students fail because I suck. That's what is expected.\n\nMe and another ta ran a course ourselves when this started last spring, because the professor was teaching 2 other courses. We redesigned the whole course for zoom. I wrote practice exams, answer keys, extra practice assignments with solutions, held multiple review sessions, and became more burned out than I've ever felt before. Basically, the response of *most of* the faculty I talked to was that I shouldnt have done that. Sure felt appreciated after that one! \n\nAnd sometimes, it's not even the professor's fault. Every professor I deal with now is teaching somewhere along the lines of 3-4 courses and coordinating them, because the university doesnt want to pay for another faculty member. For the remaining courses, just enslave grad students! Great money saver guys! Ever think about what will happen to your university when all of us decide we're fed up and are not coming back?\n\nI disagree OP, I think we all are in this together. By all, I mean the people responding to this post. We are all treated like shit, and maybe now that we're realizing we arent alone, something can finally be done. This also didnt start with the pandemic, it just got worse. I just hope I can be involved in some way while I'm still here. Because despite the love for my students and my field, I'm not sticking around here much longer.",

I feel much more at risk having to go to campus for in-person classes, especially (ironically) with testing, having to wait in line around a ton of potentially COVID-positive people.

            "comment": "As a parent, I am trying to figure out what the school can really do here. We're in a pandemic, the likes no one reading this has ever seen.\n\nIs the complaint that more classes should be in person? If they do this, they risk the covid affected rates increasing and forcing the entire campus to shut down and kids to be sent home, as it was in the Spring of 2020. In that scenario, the college gives back credits, and then teachers start losing their jobs as a result of the massive budget cuts. Binghamton doesn't control the SUNY school rules on all of this.\n\nIs the complaint that they should give money back for the inconvenience? Let me ask you - in 5-10 years, will your Binghamton degree be worth less than those who graduated before or after you? Absolutely not. You're paying for the piece of paper (if you're smart, anyway). If you're really here for the party, then I know it does suck not being able to, but in the end the school isn't making decisions based on that. They are trying to stay alive, preserve jobs for the staff, and keep the school relevant and competitive with plans for the next 30 years. This reminds me of how airlines work. If a flight is 60 minutes late, they do not then back up all remaining flights after that 60 minutes. They basically take the 200 people on that flight and kick them to curb and make them wait for an opening, this is to keep the next 20 flights on track. It is a business. The risk they run with their approach is posts like yours, but that's really the only risk. If they took your advice, their problems would be MUCH bigger in the future.\n\nMost people complaining are driven by one of two things:\n\n1. They want money back\n2. They want to party and attend class in person (or they are virus hoaxers)\n\nBoth of the above cause HUGE problems for the school, short and long term. So they are trying to keep some semblance of on campus life, mainly so they can collect the housing and food fees that they so desperately need to stay whole.\n\nAlso, you realize this sort of thing is happening across the country at many different state university systems, right? I'm sure Harvard and Yale and Stanford can provide better options with their 30+ billion endowments funds (Binghamton has less than 1% of that, and they use their non-profit, for scholarships for future students or needed repairs). \n\nSo what are you proposing? Go back to classes in person? Virus spikes, everyone sent home. That approach fails. Give people tuition credit back? That causes the budget to entirely collapse. Teachers get fired, buildings not maintained, and future classes are affected by how these negative effects hurt the schools standing (class size, enrollment, etc.). If you have 3 semesters of offline learning out of your 8, and get the same Binghamton degree as others before and after, are you really hurt in the long run since you were already planning to pay these amounts anyway? No.\n\nLet me know what you propose, to make lemonade out of these lemons.",

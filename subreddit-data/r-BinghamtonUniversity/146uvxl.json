What are some ways to get Gen Ed credit outside of coursework? \n4. Any teachers I should avoid like the plague? How about any must-have teachers? ",

Really any of the CW profs are good in my opinion. Avoid Prof Burch (there's 2, avoid both of them) like the plague.",

WRIT 111 is a popular J course as it is only for Fresh/Soph students, and as it's an introductory college writing course. \n\nYou will hear mixed opinions about this course (some probably negative), but I took this class myself, and as someone who works in advising, the course is beneficial as it fulfills several degree requirements at once, the J being one of them, and it can be annoying to fulfill these requirements otherwise. \n\nI personally recommend the class, and my advice is to just stay on top of your work and don't wait until the last minute, because this is usually why people don't like the class, since they end up having to do everything last minute. \n\nJ classes are all minimum 20 pages of writing over the course of the semester, as well as requiring two oral presentations, so each J class has this same sort of workload. IMO WRIT 111 is not a hard class at all, just get your work done in a timely manner and you'll be fine. I procrastinated pretty bad and my presentations weren't great because of anxiety, but I was still able to pull an A-.",

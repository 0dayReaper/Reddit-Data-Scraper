    "postText": "I\u2019m currently choosing classes for the Fall semester and I\u2019ve ended up with 3 lecture classes in which 2 include a discussion and 1 includes a lab. I am also just taking a gen-ed discussion class for my 4th. These lecture classes are Astronomy, Intro to Statistics, and Intro to Architecture. My issue is that with these discussion classes, I find myself potentially having to take 4 different classes on a single day. I know these classes probably aren\u2019t that difficult but is this type of schedule normal or are the amount of discussion classes a bid overkill?",

            "comment": "Pretty normal, especially for gen eds.  It sucks, but discussions sometimes dismiss early and/or get canceled so that's nice. Physics 1 and 2 are notorious for having 3 lectures, 2 discussions, and a lab all for one class. But 4 classes in a day is pretty normal, as long as it is only once or twice a week",

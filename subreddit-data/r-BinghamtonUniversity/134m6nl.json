    "postText": "I just saw [this](https://www.wbng.com/2023/04/28/binghamton-university-student-group-raised-1500-truth-pharm/) article and while I appreciate the gesture, you should know that in reality you donated $450 into Alexis Pleus' pocket as her salary is [38% of the operating expenses](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810718278) (as of 2019) of the 'non-for-profit'. \n\nTruthPharm has also lost a lot of local support/turned commenting off on their facebook because these points amount [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/r5wd8r/does_truth_pharm_have_a_black_woman_problem/) were getting posted. Probably one of the most disgusting things TruthPharm has done was [hand out marijuana at events](https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/mm5kx8/comment/gtqdm3q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), which anyone who knows anything about recovery knows how dangerous this is. \n\nTo be fair though, TruthPharm can on only survive by continuing the pointless war on drugs, otherwise they Alexis wont be able to get that 38% salary!",

That\u2019s a major part of the budget that can better serve the mission.\n\nWhy would I provide anything, I\u2019m not the one getting by grifting grieving families for things like an online list or having kids draw their parents headstones in front of the police station and take pictures to get a paycheck. \n\nAnd I\u2019m pro life as in I\u2019m pro my friends life\u2019s not ending anymore because a street chemist put too much of whatever in and another person dies. \n\nWe have a serious mental health issue with people self medicating but the medication is never the same twice. Full legalization and regulation, anything else is continuing the war on drugs with innocent people dying. \n\nOrganizations like this take funding and donations away from mental health organizations that are the key in preventing addiction.",

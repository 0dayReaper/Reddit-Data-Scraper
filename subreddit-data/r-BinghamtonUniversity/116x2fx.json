    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in high school and Binghamton is my dream school. I plan on majoring in psych and I have some questions. \n\n1. Is the psych major path quality and are the teachers and classes reputable?\n\n2. I am a LGBTQ POC, how is campus in terms of acceptance and inclusion?\n\n3. Is it an easy place to make friends and be social, I am a very social butterfly?\n\n4. What is the greek life and party scene like? \n\n5. Is there anything you wish you knew before attending Bing? Regrets?\n\n6. Any places downtown or on campus to avoid?\n\n7. Honest overall thoughts? (Classes, Teachers, Campus, Dorms, Food)\n\n8. What do you do for fun on campus?\n\nIf you can answer any of these please do, thanks :)",

I asked a few people when I went to accepted student day and the common consensus was that they\u2019re \u2018easy classes\u2019 up to a point and people on this sub seem to not like the faculty but I\u2019ll need a few specific opinions.\n\nI\u2019m aware that Stony Brook was probably a better choice for STEM but the campus looked dreary to say the least so I\u2019m happy to be at Bing.",

And are there any suggestions you have for any skills that I may have to learn to be a more competitive job/internship applicant? As of yet I don't have a specific career track I want to follow but if you have any general pointers that would help.\n\nIf I have any more questions I'll be sure to DM you, thanks again",

            "comment": "I just graduated with a math degree and I will describe my experience as mixed. The professor really determines your experience with math, since in my opinion it\u2019s one of the hardest subjects to teach yourself in (some topics are easier than others though). A lot of the math professors have weaker communication/people skills, so even if they care it can be hard to get invested in their class and listen to them. \n\nMy biggest advice with the math classes is don\u2019t be afraid to withdraw and take it the next semester if you get a professor that really doesn\u2019t work for you. As long as you\u2019re enrolled in 16+ credits before withdrawing, it won\u2019t affect your standing as a full-time student, and having a few 12-credit semesters won\u2019t affect your ability to get your degree in 4 years. If you are a double major or doing 4+1, you can easily stay on track with summer or winter classes (especially the calc classes, this can be a good solution).\n\n I had to learn the hard way by horribly failing two classes, and then retaking them and getting an A. The second time this happened I actually received the highest grade in the section and was offered a letter of rec by my professor. \n\nI viewed withdrawing as giving up, but it would have saved me a lot of anxiety and depression that those classes (and failing) caused me. In the end, when I retook them, it wasn\u2019t that I was familiar with the content (I didn\u2019t learn a thing haha). It was simply that the professor was a better fit for me.\n\nSo pick your professors and classes carefully (as others have said, ratemyprofessor!), don\u2019t be afraid to drop a class and take it some other time, and do your best to go to class and stay engaged! If you enjoy math you can learn some very cool things at this school and meet some very cool people. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Some professors are great, others are godawful, most are somewhere in the middle. Class difficulty greatly depends on what professor you have- like, Differential Geometry is normally a fairly difficult class for most people, but when I took it it was an easy A solely because of how chill the prof was. \n\nI can't say the math department has helped me much in finding a job after graduation, but that might be at least partly my fault, since I didn't really know what I was doing until my final semester at Bing. I found going to those on-campus employer info sessions to be the best way to connect with recruiters and whatnot- moreso than the job fairs, since there tend to be far less people at info sessions and you can use that to help yourself stand out more. If you're specifically interested in the actuary path, there's a track that covers that and preps you for exams and stuff too.",

Dont be discouraged - I started out hating math, failing the entrance exam, switched major freshman year to it, and just graduated with my degree in it.

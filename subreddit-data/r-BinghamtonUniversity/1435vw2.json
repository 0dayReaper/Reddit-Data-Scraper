            "comment": "I was really close to a triple major, I didn't decide in time though, I took a couple electives to bump the # of credits I was taking from semester to semester. They were all pretty different, but nothing too hard: psychology, Italian and my minor was biological anthropology. \n\nThe only way I was able to do it was bring in a fuckton of credits from high school. As a freshman, I transferred 52 credits. 32 from AP and some of my HS classes counted as credits from my local community college.\n\nI could've graduated early with my doubles but my mother wouldn't let me \ud83d\ude43",

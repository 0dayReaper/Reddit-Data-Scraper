We had *proof* of this.\n\nWhen grading time comes, the professor sends out a mass email claimimg they did multiple statistical analysis (analysi? analysises?) of the grades and found many, even those who claimed their TA to be a \"harsh grader\", had a grade above the expected mean.\n\nMost cared about inconsistencies in the assignments, not \"harshness\", especially when many of the assignments they were inconsistent on each were on their own, enough to bring your grade down a third of a letter grade.\n\n(Also yeah, same \"no consideration\" type stuff as well.)",

No curve to speak of, got a C+ and I'm just glad it's over and I don't have to retake it.\n\nOn the flip side, I most definitely should've failed a class, but when I told the professor I didn't care if I got a D as long as I passed, I'm pretty sure he threw me a bone and just gave me a D to end my misery. Love that guy, great man.",

I've done this before, even this semester I got a B+ turned to an A-. They can still submit change of grade forms for another few weeks, the forms take a bit to change the grade in the system but it eventually will. Most professors are looking to help you a bit if you just ask, so go write that email, you got this homie",

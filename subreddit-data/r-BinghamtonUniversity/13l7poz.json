    "postText": "I didn't see many posts on the grading system for phys131 so I'm making this post to hopefully help some students out. So, I didn't have Meenakshi, which is the professor most students seem to have, so I can't speak on her teaching abilities. My prof was Suzuki and even though she was very kind and upbeat, I didn't learn much in her class. I'd recommend making the most of your TA's office hours or going to UTS Tutoring because those 2 resources (especially tutoring) were where I actually understood some material. Tutoring was like having a one on one session with a former phys student and they explained concepts really well. As for the grading system in this class, it's a bit random. There are set scores that are in the syllabus which determine your letter grade but the curve is only applied to your scores at the very end of the class so you're kind of left in the dark regarding how well you may have done. This curve is also pre-determined based on an assumption of what students scores will be so there's no way to accurately predict your grade. Personally, I had a weak prior knowledge of physics and my grades aligned perfectly with the class average which was in the 50s range. My grades in other aspects of the course were all in the high 90s (attendance, in-class iclicker questions, hw etc) and my discussion quiz average was in the 70s. I'm not sure how I did on the final since that score was never released (or at least hasn't been at the time I'm writing this). So, with all that, my final letter grade ended up being a B- which I'm pretty happy with. If you're struggling with the class I'd say to do your best in all the things beyond exams that you can control, reach out for help early on and remember that everyones in the same boat. Good luck and I'd definitely suggest taking phys132 over the summer!",

I had Suzuki as well and she was very nice, but agreeing with OP i didn\u2019t learn much in her class either. without having a prior knowledge of college physics (which i did thanks to AP), this class will most likely be a struggle. as far as physics 2, i recommend as well to take it somewhere else :)",

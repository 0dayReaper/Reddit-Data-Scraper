            "comment": "I've lived in the Binghamton area for nearly a decade. Is Binghamton as safe as nice parts of wealthier areas like long island, Westchester, etc? No. Is is safer than inner cities? Yes.\n\nFirst understand that Binghamton is both the colloquial name for the whole Binghamton metro area as well as the specific city of Binghamton located in this metro area.\n\nThe whole metro area isn't actually that big (by car). Without counting the very rural parts, you can get to most places within 10-20 minutes. Despite this, areas do have significantly different vibes. In general, the closer you are to dense, walkable areas, the higher the crime risk. \n\nThe main campus is actually located in the town of Vestal, which is very safe. Vestal is basically suburbia with strip malls and no downtown. And campus is very safe as it has its own campus police, surveillance, and doesn't see much non-affiliated locals. Very few night stuff takes place on campus and most people don't live on campus, so it empties out.\n\nMost off-campus students will live in or near downtown Binghamton and either drive to campus, take a free bus/shuttle, or carpool. This is where the majority of student night life takes place (frats, bars, etc). They are also in the works of building a bike path to connect downtown to the main vestal campus, but it's not done yet.\n\nThis downtown area can definitely see more crime. It will not be uncommon to see belligerent drug addicts roaming the streets. There have been numerous stabbings and shootings that made the news since I've lived here. Some people will say it's perfectly safe, but I'm guessing they're used to living in worse areas and have normalized it. If you stay close to where the students are and go in groups, use some street smarts, they say you *should* be fine. At this point, I have zero reason to ever go downtown so I never do.\n\nIn terms of Binghamton proper, I would try to avoid the denser areas north of main street west of downtown as well as many areas on the east side. Visiting random businesses in commerical districts is one thing, but it's pretty obvious driving through that you're driving through a ghetto that feels eerily similar to an inner city. Violent crime and property crime is rampant. I genuinely don't even feel safe driving through it at this point after numerous scary encounters and will instead use other roads to bypass it.\n\nSimilarly, most of Johnson city should also probably be avoided including downtown JC and the area by UHS Wilson Hospital (unless you actually need to go to the hospital obviously). The latter is actually where the university has started creating a new satellite campus for pharmacy/nursing. There is some hope that this can revitalize the area, but as of the time I write this, that hasn't happened yet. I know people that work in this area and they all say they feel unsafe. The exception to Johnson city is the area by Wegmans, which feels just as safe as Vestal.\n\nEndicott can have some shady areas too, but you probably won't be spending much time there unless you're exploring. \n\nThe less dense areas of the area feel pretty darn safe. I would never have stuck around this long if i didn't have a car that allowed me to live further away from the high density areas where crime is significant.\n\nIf I were a student again today, I would most likely live on campus as long as possible and then either live in UClub (private student apartments in vestal) or save up for a car so I could live further away.",

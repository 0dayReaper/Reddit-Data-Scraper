            "comment": "Heya, I'm heavily involved with music on campus. I'm a pianist and vocalist myself, but I can tell you some things off the top of my head. \n\n\\-Explorchestra: clearly you've already heard about this one; I'm involved myself and it's a great time! If you compose at all, it's a great opportunity to get your pieces played, but it's also just fun to be a part of (I play piano). \n\n\\-Orchestra: The student orchestra; I know you know about this one but just thought I'd list it.\n\n\\-Piano Ensemble: this is an ensemble you can be involved in as a pianist. I'm planning on auditioning myself next semester. \n\n\\-Collaborative piano lessons: I'm also planning on taking these next semester. You basically learn to accompany vocalists, etc. I want to go into music education with a vocal emphasis so I feel like these lessons benefit me. \n\n\\-Sound of Binghamton: \\*shamless plug\\* we are a community service-oriented group of musicians who go around Binghamton and Johnson city playing at nursing homes, churches, elementary schools, etc. We take any instrumentalists or vocalists!! Basically how it works is we all divide into small groups and prepare performances (we had a string quintet and a string quartet this semester, and I played the piano on several pieces). It's very low-commitment (we rehearse outside of club and then meet once for a 'rehearsal check' before the performances). It's a lot of fun; we're a small but mighty group!\n\n\\-Jazz bands: if you play jazz piano, Binghamton boasts two jazz ensembles that both take pianists. \n\n\\-Music classes: I am a music major myself, but you don't have to be a music major to take any of these classes! We boast a wide variety of music classes, including (but not limited to) music theory, music history, composition, orchestration, conducting, jazz/US Popular music history, african drumming, and pretty much lessons for any instrument you can think of (including voice)\n\nJust a couple things, feel free to dm me if you want to talk more about music opportunities! There's also a huge band scene in Binghamton (that I happen to be a part of) if that's something you're interested.",

                            "comment": "Hello! You should dm me, I work for harpur advising so we can discuss logistics. The short answer is a music minor (or major) pairs very nicely with other programs, especially if you start early (I am a psych and music double Major myself). You need an \u201cAesthetics\u201d (or A) gen Ed during your time at Binghamton anyway, and music theory covers that; you should definitely take it!",

I know they're partially furnished but I'm not really sure what I'll expect to need. \n\nI'm especially focused on shared items and kitchen items to get that out of the way first. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Uclub does not come with any kitchenware beyond a stove, sink, washing machine, microwave, and refrigerator. You will need to bring silverware, bowls, plates, etc. For shared items, I would say:\n\nBowls, plates, cups, silverware, cooking trays (for the oven), mixing bowls (For baking or making meatloaf as I like to do, generally very handy), accessory utensils (spatulas, large spoons, tongs, etc), knives, measuring cups, cutting board.\n\nThat list is not comprehensive but you can fill it in with anything else you think you might need. I'd err on the side of if you think you might need it, bring it.",

            "comment": "i ve never lived in U Club so idk what they provide but I will provide a small list if things that I as someone who lived on my own  for the first time bought for my appartment this past year that was really nice:\n\ncurtains \ngarbage pale with a lid\nsmall garvage pale for bathroom\nscrub daddy sponge (its just a really nice reusable sponge for doing dishes)\nwater filter/pitcher\nplunger\nbroom and/or mop and/or dustpan\nhamper (not necissary maybe)\nclothes basket\npack of cheap washcloths for rags\npower strips(like 1 or 2)\nsome first aid stuff, adhesive bandages, gause, medical tape,  disinfectant, ibuprofen, acetomediphine, pepto-bismol, alergy medicine whatever else you need.\nbuy a large pack of batteries, like 30+ and just keep it somewhere so you have it when you need it.\nhaving a small set of basic tools is handy but not necessary\nand non negotiable if uclub doesnt provide one: a fire extinguisher. ya never know and if your living on your own alwaysale sure to have one\n\nIf you plan on doing a lot of cooking a meat thermometer, tupperware, spatulas, spoons etc. cooking depends on what you will be cooking and for kitchen stuff i recommend getting the basics and then just buying as needed. also if you dont know how to cook recipes are pretty easy to find online and follow. also i found an air fryer and a crock pot to be nice to have just as far as the student lifestyle the things they allowed me to make was nice\n\nI also like to keep some canned food just handy in case i dont feel like cooking or uber eatsing, like soup and stuff\n\ncertainly not an an exhaustive list but i hope that helps.",

            "comment": "Full XL or Queen Bedsheets. The bed is full xl but queen sheets fit just fine. Bedrooms have the mattress only,  bed frame, desk, chair, night stand, and two 2-drawer drawers\n\nI'd personally recommend getting a bed bug cover for the mattress just in case bc despite all the cleaning they might do, ya never know so I use one just in case and then put all my Bedsheets over it. Obviously bring pillow and blankets as well. \n\nThe room is pretty bare besides the furniture so if u want any more storage containers or cube organizers or anything else of the sort, just get stuff from Walmart, ikea, target, etc\n\nKitchen stuff like utensils, pots/pans, kitchen tools, and additional appliances like a toaster or an air fryer or coffee machine you'd have to bring yourself.\n\nCommon areas, some people like area rugs, maybe a tall standing lamp (useful for bedrooms too, I use an ikea one in mine) and other entertainment stuff like a TV (there's an entertainment center but no tv), no cable so get some streaming device like a roku or fire stick. \n\nExtra stuff you can bring is computer equipment, monitors, ethernet cable (good ethernet here imo), cleaning supplies (general and bathroom cleaners), bath towels, shower stuff, all that jazz",

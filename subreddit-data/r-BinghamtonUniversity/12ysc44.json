    "postText": "So it\u2019s that point of the semester and things aren\u2019t looking too good, I def overloaded this semester (Orgo, Bio 113 and Pre Calc and two other courses) and about half way in I started having sleep troubles because of a impacted tooth leading to trouble focusing in class and just overall was not pleasant, i decided to p/f my hardest class at the moment which was pre calc but ended up having to get a emergency extraction about last week, In doing so I missed a few days and now i\u2019m behind and have two exams left (one + final) and now I honestly think I have no hope of passing the class, any advice for the late withdrawal petition ? It also doesn\u2019t help that i\u2019m still recovering from getting 4 teeth extracted. I heard it\u2019s almost near impossible to get course withdrawals approved, but this F on my transcript would really mess me up and I don\u2019t know what to do",

            "comment": "Medical withdrawal is for all of your courses, it goes through the CARE team (as in, you must meet with them to process a medical withdrawal). \n\nLate withdrawal and late P/F is for one course. They are both hard to get approved, going to be honest. The key for the petition, whether late withdrawal or late P/F, is to be as detailed as possible, and to provide as much OFFICIAL documentation that you can (this could mean things like medical records). Make sure they have dates on them. The point of the petition is to successfully argue the timing of the withdrawal - as in, why you didn't withdraw before the deadline.\n\nStudents have issues with these petitions because many feel uncomfortable providing medical documents with the idea that it's \"not the school's business.\" I'm keeping my personal opinions out of this one as I work for the school, but you will unfortunately more than likely have to provide medical records in order for it to get approved. DETAIL is the key, be very specific. \n\nIf the late withdrawal doesn't work, you can also submit a General Academic Petition (GAP) through Harpur Advising to see if you can do a late P/F (if you think you can get at least a D) so you don't have an F on your transcript. Same advice above applies.",

I'm not doing well in my classes and I'm just hoping for the best and that I can pull through for the finals. I really hope we don't get an F on our transcripts. Things aren't great but let's try our best to finish strong &lt;3 (tbh I don't even know I can... but we just gotta try and hope for the best at this point)",

Is there any way you could talk to the professor about whether you still have a hope of passing and if there's any chance of you being able to take things late or get extended time or only need to complete one of the exams and count it for both or anything like that?",

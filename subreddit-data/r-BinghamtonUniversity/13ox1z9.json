Any transfer courses are not factored into your GPA, but they can be used to fulfill requirements and give you elective credits. \n\nHowever, typically the grade you got in the transfer course will be listed on your transcript, so if you got an A-, it will be listed as \"TA-,\" the 'T' here indicating it's a transfer course.",

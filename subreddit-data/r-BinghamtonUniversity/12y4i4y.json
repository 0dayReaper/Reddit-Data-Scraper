The same can be said about most of the communities though. It\u2019s really what you make of it",

I lived in CIW which everyone said was super social but if u don\u2019t put urself out there u won\u2019t make friends. If ur extroverted and like to meet ppl and go out of ur way to do it you\u2019ll have no problem anywhere",

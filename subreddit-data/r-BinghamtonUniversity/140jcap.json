    "postText": "I am an upcoming freshman. I cannot log into my Bmail or Binghamton Google account of any sort because every time, after I type in my password it asks me for an eight digit backup code through authenticator which I cannot find nor did I create. \nIf anyone has a solution to this problem please let me know because I\u2019m trying to see my time slot for rooming.",

            "comment": "Those are different things. You have three different codes associated with your accounts:\n\n- Your BU accounts have a 2FA authentication, which is a moving 6-digit code.\n- Your Google workspace accounts (including B-Mail, B-Cal, Google Docs and Google Drive) have a 2FA authentication, which is a different moving 6-digit code\n\nNote that you would get these from an authentication app, like Google Authenticator or others.\n\n- Your Google Workspace account also has a series of one-time use fixed 8-digit recovery codes that you should have printed out and saved somewhere. I don\u2019t recall, but I think there are either 10 or 12 of them. Those were generated when your Google Workspace account was created. \n\nEither way, if you have none of them, you get to go to ITS on campus with your ID to reset your passwords.",

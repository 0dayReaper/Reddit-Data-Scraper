            "comment": "i have no car and live here \u2014 the shuttle runs only in the morning before all the buses run. i\u2019ve not taken it before but that\u2019s what it\u2019s advertised as. i usually take the 17 to campus (there\u2019s a stop on main/baker and main/allen) and it takes maybe 6 minutes or so to walk there.\n\ni like living here, the rent is cheap compared to other apartments with similar layouts. the utilities can get a bit expensive during the winter months but as long as you\u2019re mindful, it shouldn\u2019t ever be over $80. there\u2019s a free printer, activity room, gym, and mail delivery service. the washer/dryer is $1.75 per load so keep that in mind. \n\ni know the reviews make scott (the manager) out to be an asshole but he\u2019s very understanding and accommodating in my opinion. no one has ever gone inside my apartment without notice (i set up cameras over break to check). overall, it\u2019s a relatively quiet place to live in and you\u2019ll be mostly around grad students and healthcare workers who work at the uhs 5 minutes from the apartment. the occasional decker student also lives there (that\u2019s me!)\n\nhope this helps, lmk if you have any other questions! :)",

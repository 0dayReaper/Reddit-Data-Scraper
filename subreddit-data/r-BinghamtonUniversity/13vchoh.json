We'll be looking at music videos, children's literature, two movies, a graphic novel, and different kinds of ads! Starts tomorrow but you have a few days to register. If you email me, I'll send the syllabus to you!\n\nThere is a previous post about courses not being available yet--no worries, they open at midnight tonight!\n\nHope to see you on my roster :)",

If you don't, your spot goes to the next person.\n\nIf you see open spots in a different section with a wait-list, don't get off your wait-list to try to get into the other section, or you'll lose your spot and have to wait another semester (ask me how I know lmao)\n\nThe likelihood all depends on how many people were on the wait-list before you, and I would guess how desirable a time it is. If it's a 6-9pm, for example, I would guess the likelihood is high because people don't want that time and would rather take something else, if they can.",

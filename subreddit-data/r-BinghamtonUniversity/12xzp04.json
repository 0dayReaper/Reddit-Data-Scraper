You unfortunately cannot take these prereq courses in the same semester as either HSCI 200 or BIOL 251.\n\nI believe BIOL 251 is full at the moment (there's a few seats available, but only for students on the waitlist), so your best bet is to waitlist the course since you will need it to IUT to Decker.\n\nYou yourself cannot register for HSCI 200 as a Harpur student, but I would suggest maybe reaching out to Decker advising to see if they can enroll you in the course if they have any extra seats available. I can't promise they'll be willing to do this, but it's worth a shot. \n\nThe good news is that BIOL 251 is a large class so the chance that a seat opens up for you between the few weeks of registration we have left is high. I'd say waitlist 251 now, then ask Decker about 200, worst case scenario, they say no, you still have your name on the list for when 251 becomes available.",

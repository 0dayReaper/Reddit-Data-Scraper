She now works as an environmental engineer for a company up near Watertown.\n\nSo TLDR, there is a route, though she says if she had to do it again, she would have done the undergrad at ESF and rolled straight into their new ME program. \n\n&gt; I'd tell them to get out of Bing and go straight to ESF because I learned the hard way an environmental engineer can do anything an environmental science major can do but not vice versa. And both degrees cost the same and take the same amount of time.\n\nI won\u2019t comment more because she says she may jump on here later tonight and you can just ask her questions directly.",

I would like to know if the program has most courses during the day or at night. This is important as I'll be a full-time software engineer if I'm enrolled.",

Also bear in mind that some classes may have an Online Asynchronous section.",

That said, the classroom scheduler algorithm attempts to place as many courses as possible between 10:00-6:00.\n\nYou can definitely do the MSCS as a full time employee (I\u2019ve had others as students in previous semesters), but it\u2019s something you should bring up with the grad director and secretary so they can prioritize your enrollments.\n\nIt may also require you taking summer/winter semester courses or talking to your boss about flexible work weeks (like a 4x10 or 4x9+1x4 work week). My FT MS students all did both of those.",

    "postText": "Hello All,\n\nWe would like to bring your attention to the Graduate Student Employee Union's (GSEU) Living Wage Campaign. You might have seen us protesting on January 18th near the admin building, or heard about us in the news. Have a look at the [BU Pipe Dream Article on our campaign\n](https://www.bupipedream.com/news/133626/gseu-protests-for-a-living-wage/). Here's what it's all about:\n\nA livable wage for Broome County is $34,574/year for a single adult. On average, grad workers here make 56% of that, and we aren't allowed outside employment.\n\nPlease support your TAs, grad assistants, and all graduate workers by signing [our petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/bing_livingwage). And please share the petition with as many people as you can. Anyone can sign regardless of university affiliation. Thank you all!",

So in addition to all of the administrative tasks required to run a class, we have to become competent enough in a largely unfamiliar subject matter to teach, design course material, and assess it. It\u2019s also really uncommon to be given a lot of guidance and most of us learn to run classes by asking our fellow grad students. The amount of stress and anxiety that goes into trying to learn and teach an unfamiliar topic is immense and something we often don\u2019t address/discuss. There are a few things that create imposter syndrome more intensely then having to get up in front of dozens of students and pretend you are an authority on a subject you were just exposed to less than a week ago.",

It was only after my grad chair intervened that I was granted 9 hours of outside work a week. I am in one of the lowest paid depts (around $17k for PhDs and $12k for MAs) and this extra income is essential. I truly believe part of the reason grad students languish for years is because they\u2019re torn between working enough to feed themselves and finding the time to complete their work and research. It\u2019s a terrible place to find yourself, especially if you have a family.",

Can you clarify, are you paying tuition to be a graduate student, and getting paid if you do work as a grad student on top of that?\n3. Is it work-work or is it part of your educational advancement by relating to your subject of study?",

You are only allowed to work 20 hrs/week. Just last year we stopped paying fees (unless international) and as for tuition they only over NYS residential tuitions amounts. For the course I TA for I do: all the grading, all the emails, office hours, and have 2 discussion groups I lead as 1 credit courses while attending the professors lectures.  The class I teach for has nothing to do with what I study it is what the department needed filled. As per question 1, this is the line in our contracts: \u201cGA/TAs are expected to divide their time between their assistantship duties and the pursuit of a graduate degree. Any additional work assignment by any full-time (20 hour) GA/TA is generally prohibited and would require exceptional circumstances and explicit approval from the Graduate School prior to the commencement of performing any duties\u201d.",

We should be able to live at or above the poverty line so we can focus on school and not panic weekly about how we will pay our bills. What will happen to us if we have to go to the doctor? Or the prices of food keep going up? We do a lot for the school and we just want to be paid enough to survive.",

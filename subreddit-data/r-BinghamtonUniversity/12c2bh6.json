    "postText": "Hi, alumna here. I graduated in 2008 and found a job in the area and stayed (my husband did too). I've been working in various capacities to improve our community and often the conversations turn to trying to keep more BU students in the area.\n\nAs students and alumni, what would convince or would have convinced you to stay in the area? Or, if you did stay in the area, what made you stay?\n\nFor me, I definitely was not planning on staying here. I'm from upstate, my dad happens to have grown up in Endwell NY, but most of our family left this area and never looked back. However upon graduation, my husband and I both found jobs, so stuck around. Then we built friendships, bought a house, had kids, etc. Generally we like it here, ultimately what keeps us here are the relationships we have and the cost of living. I know everyone complains about the weather, but it's is beautiful here spring, summer and fall.",

I will say that we like the area a lot more now than when we were in undergrad, probably because we are more involved in the actual community instead of the university \u201cbubble\u201d. That being said, here are the things that would make us consider staying:\n\n1. Better, affordable housing options. Right now we\u2019re in a \u201cluxury\u201d apartment building that isn\u2019t that great and is way too expensive\n2. Well-paying jobs that we both enjoy \n3. Good public schools to send our future children to\n4. A more progressive mindset from both the local government and the community as a whole\n5. A passenger train that at least goes downstate, so we can have weekend trips to the city and to visit our families without needing our car  \n6. Better healthcare options",

Moving into an apartment complex that isn\u2019t student housing was also nice because you live with a bunch of different ages/professions and you\u2019re not as isolated as you would be by renting a house. I also joined the Binghamton town subreddit (I don\u2019t know how to link it) and Binghamton facebook groups to learn about things going on in the community, like festivals and stuff like that. We also got a local farm share if that\u2019s your vibe, which connected us with local produce and made us feel like we were a part of something. I\u2019ve been to black bears hockey games, and I want to go to Rumble Ponies baseball games and local theater productions too.

            "comment": "Recent grad still in the area, probably just for now. I stuck around for my job offer and to save up some money early on. I went in open to staying long term, but I don't think it's likely as of now. My biggest complaint is a bit circular: there's a sizable population gap in the Binghamton area for people in their low 20s to mid 30s. Seems like most BU students head to NYC or wherever they grew up, while the local kids who can, run away like their life depends on it.\n\nAs I'm not a local, I can't speak to what drives them away, but in terms of BU students, it's a complex issue but I have some ideas:\n\n1. BU students view Bing as a shithole that depends entirely on the school to survive, and townies as borderline subhuman crack addicts. I think those reputations arise because, for many of them, its the first time they've been consistently in such close proximity to homeless people. Bing needs to do a better job of rehabilitating its homeless population to help them get back on track and into a home. Regardless of actual effect, that'll go a long way towards making students feel generally safer and happier.\n2. Bing's housing market is a travesty. A huge portion of the rental market is reserved exclusively for students, and the few places that aren't are either way over-priced \"luxury\" apartments or houses meant for a family with kids. This leaves very little for young adults who don't want to budget like they live in Queens without the benefits of living in Queens. Remove occupation/student-status discrimination in housing. Students are frequently willing to pay more than locals for their housing and are ideal tenants for the city's slumlords as they can be easily exploited for their parents' money and have low standards of living. Students' low standard of living is a huge reason Bing is full of beautiful houses in disrepair. They don't care if the ceiling starts leaking in May, they'll be gone in a month, so they don't submit a complaint or work order, and lord knows the landlords won't make repairs out of altruism. Students don't need housing set aside for them, if anything, non-students do, and absentee-landlords need to be punished for poisoning neighborhoods by continually allowing their properties to fall into disrepair.\n3. Entertainment. Outside of getting intoxicated and/or going to a minor league sports game, there's little in terms of cheap, casual entertainment in Bing. The Regal may be nominally in Bing, but the 10 minute drive to get there from DT stretches into an hour if you decide to try it on foot. Take a walk down Court St or State St, what do you find? A bunch of restaurants (one of the most redeeming parts of Bing), fast food, and convenience stores/gas stations. Not even the corny, trendy entertainment businesses like escape rooms or axe throwing. Rec park is pretty nice but its a bit away from where students tend to congregate, and there's no better alternative. There's plenty of golf but that mostly overshoots the ideal age group to draw in. The locals I've met love fishing in Binghamton, yet there's no commercialization of the rivers (e.g. fishing rod or kayak rentals). There's nice hiking spots in the area, but like the movies, you **have** to drive there. Also despite the significant young, energetic population, the stadiums are terribly underutilized for concerts, at least concerts that attract young people. \n4. Fully embrace and champion Washington Street. Right in the heart of the best developed area of the city is this beautiful little commercial street, full of small businesses and charm. There's a little park and murals and mixed development housing. The bike lanes where Court intersects are fantastic, they need to extend down the rest of Court/Main though. I just wish that parking garage hadn't been built on the corner of Hawley because otherwise Washington could've been easily converted to a walking only street, freeing up space for vendors, food carts, street performers, and community events. \n\nI think Bing already is taking a lot of nice steps towards improving these fields, and in a matter of time climate change may make the Bing climate friendlier, but ultimately this is a massive uphill battle (and I don't like rooting for climate change). If they can be successful, it's inevitable that they'll upset a lot of (rich/powerful) people along the way, which kills some of my confidence that it will truly get done. I hope for the best though; Bing is home to some of the friendliest people I've ever met.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2019 and I stayed through 2022 (4 years as a student. 4 years as a townie). The only reason I stayed was because I had no real income since employment after graduating wasn't on the table. I had a job offer, but then Covid screwed everything up. People were fleeing cities, rental markets were going haywire. Binghamton made sense on paper to stay to wait it out since it's one of the cheapest housing and rental markets in the country and the cheapest area to live closest to NYC. 3+ hours without traffic is certainly not commuting distance, but it was close enough to visit when needed. Don't be fooled by the prices though. The lower priced places are normally slums. Rentals are just disgusting in the area. Even the newer complexes are terrible because they built them in sketchy areas. If you want to live comfortably here, you need to buy a house, probably in Vestal. \n\nBinghamton as a town had a very different feel once I graduated and stopped being affiliated with the university. When I was a student, I was able to socialize and spent most of my time on campus. After graduating, the pool of people my age that I could relate to that weren't sketchy trash became non-existent. In the 4 years I stayed, I never found anyone I could to be friends with.\n\nI'll be blunt. Townies are largely uneducated and it's not like the local high schools are doing a good job fixing that. Lots of drug addicts, lots of punk kids, wannabe gangsters, drug dealers, etc. that I didn't feel safe to be around let alone want to be friends with. Dating apps were laughably bad. Once I aged out of college students' age filters, there was no one to swipe in. The app would say there's no one and ask me to broaden the search radius to places 2 hours away. \n\nAlso, older \"townies\" seemed to not want to classify me as being a local. They seem to like college students, but I received a lot of aggressive remarks when they found out I wasn't a college student anymore. Whenever I revealed I wasn't in college anymore, they immediately wanted to know why I didn't leave yet. If people asked me where I lived and I told them Binghamton, townies were dismissive to that. They seem to only consider people that grew up or are multi-generational Binghamton natives to be real Binghamton locals. Everyone else is considered temporary transplants. I could never figure out if townies telling me to leave Binghamton was because they were trying to gatekeep Binghamton to \"real locals\" or if they were genuinely concerned for my well-being and wanted me to escape before it destroyed me like it destroyed them. \n\nIn terms of access to things. I highlight on some below, but realistically there's nothing actually in Binghamton. The town is a a highway junction which makes it convenient for road trips throughout the area. There's nothing of actual value within at least 1 to 1.5 hours. I appreciated that some people were trying to build a culture for the area, but there needs to be more to a town than the birthplace of the Twilight Zone creator, some old crappy carousels from 3/4 century ago, and an ordinary marinated chicken sandwich.  As some unironic and fully serious townies like to brag about on r/Binghamton or around town, \"everything is only 3 hours away!\" wOw! Ya hear that, only 6 hours round trip durhhhhh. Good thing gas prices are low. And the roads are hilly, in poor condition so you can't even use cruise control! durhhhh. What convenience!\n\nWhy I left?\n\n- Limited access to health care and almost no access to specialty care. There's threads on this issue on r/Binghamton. Binghamton local health care is horrific. I think the only reason the few doctors and facilities in the area are still practicing is because most people here are too poor to hire a respectable malpractice attorney, people aren't smart enough to question the corruption, are too ignorant to expect higher standards, and because the UHS and Lourdes regional duopoly own the city and local media. A portion of my budget went to transportation so I could travel to the NYC metro area to get health care. It only worked out because I would crash on the floor of a friend or relative when I had to visit. This was a huge inconvenience and a big reason for me to say enough is enough. \n\n- The weather can't be understated. The constant rain and lack of sunny days. The long and brutal winters. Winters lasted from late October through May. Summers were mild and it normally didn't heat up until the end of June. So we really only had 2 months of actual summer. Fall and Spring don't actually exist. Fall weather and foliage lasts about 2 weeks or less. Spring is just continuation of winter. Even with warmer weather in the summer, it would rain for weeks without a clear day in the forecast. You know it's bad when Binghamton has worse weather than places like Seattle that are known for bad weather. My mental health went in the toilet and I picked up some breathing issues since I was always inside.\n\n- Very limited outdoor recreation. When there was a clear day, there was hardly anything you could actually do aside going for a walk in the mud.\n\n - Winter: It was somehow the perfect combination of wet freezing weather, but also not enough snow and consistent freezing temperatures for winter snow activities. The city can't keep the limited ice rinks open. Ice fishing isn't an option since the rivers don't normally freeze. Local ski hills like Greek Peak can't stay open. Only select days in the winter you could actually cross-country or snowshoe, usually only after a large snow storm. There was no benefit to the cold brutal winters, just all the cons. \n\n - Summer: Hiking trails were limited. Binghamton is not scenic and all the hiking trails are just reclaimed farm land with new forests. Just under the tree line muddy stroll through the woods. With the never ending rain, the trails are usually muddy and it's poor trail maintenance to hike them in those conditions. \n - Lots of bugs in the summer\n - Those two weeks of foliage are the nicest times to hike, though there's much nicer places in the Northeast.\n\n - Swimming: There isn't much or any real options. I grew up on Long Island where there were tons of public beaches. \"Upstate\" is known for it's lakes, but Binghamton doesn't have any. The closest true lakes are the finger lakes and those are 1-2 hours away. For swimming, your options are very limited if your residence doesn't have a pool. Community city pools which were unsurprisingly ghetto. \"Lakes\" nearby (within 1 hour driving) to places like  Dorchester, Cole, Chenango, Greenwood. All of these lake/reservoirs are pretty terrible. They're heavily regulated, tiny little swim zones that make it impossible to actually swim and are surrounded by farm land which would routinely cause an algae bloom or bacteria build-up that forced swim areas to close for weeks or even the whole season. Chenango had the only swim area that was beyond waist deep, but that's only because they built a pool deck and dug in so they could install a diving board. The swim area was still tiny and they kept the \"deep water\" area around the diving board closed on the weekdays. The nicest place to swim was in the East Gym, but I lost access to the pool when I graduated. \n  - I joined a couple gyms in the area, but the pools were similarly limited, disgusting or overpriced.\n\n- Nowhere to go at night or just walk around. Parks close at dark. City streets are dangerous to walk at night.",

                    "comment": "(Continued)\n\n- Limited stores and services: \n - Similar to the medical issue. There were plenty of grocery stores and you could get most things you needed, but more niche and specialty stuff was hard to get. I ended up relying mostly on Amazon and online services. Too many times I was told to drive to Syracuse or Rochester as if they're right around the corner. \n\n- No usable or nearby major airport. Traveling by plane became frightfully expensive and inconvenient. There was no way I was going to fly out of Binghamton or one of these local small airports when the cost of a plane ticket is exponentially more than flying out of a big airport. Seems most of the locals either drive to NYC, Philadelphia or pay more to get a connecting flight out of Syracuse. Multiple times a prospective employer wanted to fly me to their location for in-person interviews, but it didn't work out because they couldn't budget the necessary transportation costs or I had to pay the costs. I had to turn down the roles because of Binghamton. NYC is also a cluster **** for airport parking. \n  \n- Greyhound bus is disgusting. Did it twice, never again. It doesn't help that the downtown bus depot is one of the sketchiest places in the area. Remember that stabbing that happened right in the loading area that left a trail of blood at the downtown bus depot? F**K THAT.\n\n-  Crime: \"Highest crime per capita\" in the state. I'm just so sick of seeing the meth addicts on the corners, the thugs and sketchy people when all I wanted to do was buy some groceries or get a haircut. I luckily never had a problem due to quickly learning the area and knowing which parts to stay away from, but I eventually got numb to the reports of shootings and armed robberies. This made Binghamton feel even smaller and really removed any allure to exploring.\n\n-  The local small businesses are scum, scam artists, and fraudsters: It became a rule for me not to trust any local small business in Binghamton. To the day I left, not a single small business I interacted with was honest, good value, or deserving of staying in business. Even many of the franchises places were bad if corporate was foolish enough to give that location too much autonomy. I'd start naming places, but apparently a lot of them are known for frivolous SLAPP lawsuits to censor and intimate.\n\n-  Some of the highest property tax rates in the country. As if I needed to be further dissuaded from planting more permanent roots. The housing market in Binghamton has also historically has been very volatile, likely due to low volume of buyers/sellers. Besides for the cheap real estate, I saw no reason to actually buy anything.\n\n- No jobs or money. It was laughable at the lack of employment opportunities nearby. I tried to get an internship after my first year nearby, just something introductory to pad a resume. I think the only employer at the University career fair that was local to the area was some small insurance mutual company downtown that didn't even have any open roles. I think the biggest company somewhat nearby is Lockheed Martin, some manufacturing gigs, etc... None of these jobs pay great. You're paying NY taxes without the high salaries you get near NYC to compensate for it.\n\n- New York State is very unfriendly to small businesses. I think it's funny that the university goes crazy trying to get students and the community to utilize their incubator and funding. So, not only could I not get a job, the environment was terrible for creating my own business.\n\n- New York State is one of the most corrupt places in the country. I'm not just talking about the top. Local governments are corrupt, Binghamton included. People here are cancer that take pride in things like like racketeering, embezzlemet, and fraud. Take a look at Prospect Mountain highway project that is absurdly over budget and should have been completed a long time ago. Remember that tunnel/bridge that became unstable shortly after it finished? Remember those parking garages? Remember the university getting price gouged on construction bids for the baseball stadium? Lourdes and UHS are in the pockets and don't face consequences to their horrible malpractice and rampant billing fraud. Republicans. Democrats. They're all the same in Binghamton. Everyone's corrupt. It doesn't matter if something is illegal in Binghamton when the town is too corrupt to enforce the law. The only reason Binghamton is even still breathing is from tax dollars funneled in from other parts of the state by Albany and Washington (welfare payments, SUNY money, hospital money, covid money, and now that new lithium ion battery plant in endicott that only exists because of tax dollars). There is no organic growth whatsoever.\n\n- I left New York entirely. I'm priced out of the NY metro area and I have no reason to stay and pay NY taxes if I'm not receiving New York City higher wages. \n\n- Perception. It's shallow, but it was an issue. I was judged negatively for living here. It's not like living in a low cost of living area in some place nice. Binghamton isn't nice, it's a crap hole. Most people live here out of desperation or because they have too many roots here where convincing others to leave feels impossible. They don't actually like Binghamton.  All my former friends and family ridiculed me for living in Binghamton. Whenever I ever I went to visit and met new people, I would be introduced as \"living upstate\" because they were too embarrassed to admit to their friends that I lived in Binghamton. When I did say Binghamton, I got a lot of \"eww\" or even very judgemental remarks. I'm not condoning that pretentiousness and I'm disgusted with people's shallowness. But they weren't completely wrong. When I finally left, it was surreal. My life was frozen in Binghamton. Simple luxuries and lower standards of living I just accepted. I feel like I threw away my 20s by staying and being too comfortable accepting a hermit lifestyle. It wasn't worth the money I saved, but my options were limited and I stayed out of desperation, not by choice.",

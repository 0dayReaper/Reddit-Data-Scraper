Too many symbols, drawings, etc...\n\nA stylus pen with a touch screen (tablet or 2 in 1 notebook) could be an alternative if he wants to keep his notes digital and using a note taking app. Those were still pretty rare in the classroom since most students will just use an ordinary notebook and pen for math courses. \n\nI think I would have preferred the tablet/note taking app when I was a student. I have horrible handwriting, can't spell, notes were messy. Digital notes are pretty cool. You can record audio and sync it to what you're writing to playback the lecture. You can import diagrams instead of wasting time drawing them. They can clear up your handwriting and turn them into print, spell check, etc...",

            "comment": "I recommend an iPad! I used an iPad to take all my notes in all my math classes and it really helps me because I like to write different formulas in different colors and such. A single iPad beats carrying the weight of a notebook for each class. Plus!!! A lot of times professors will mess up as well and you want to rewrite certain notes quickly. Erasing on an ipad IS SO MUCH EASIER than erasing with pencil and paper. This is great especially if the professor writes fast and then erases the board just as fast.\n\n  \n\n\nA bonus if you want to shell money on note taking apps, but both notability and good notes have a recording function that pinpoints what was said at the time certain notes were written. So if you record the lecture while writing you can listen back to catch what was said in case you missed it in class. This is not necessary of course, but my friend used the function a lot and it helps a lot with professors who talk really fast about difficult concepts.",

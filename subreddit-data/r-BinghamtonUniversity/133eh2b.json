    "postText": "Incoming first year \n\nWhat is the time slot thing that it says on the website ([https://www.binghamton.edu/residential-life/housing/newstudents/first-year.html](https://www.binghamton.edu/residential-life/housing/newstudents/first-year.html)**)** for june 5th? Does that mean the portal to pick rooms will open then or do we have to pick by then because it says groups need to be picked by the 29th. Also where do we enter the portal to actually pick the groups? The website opens to IT support, and I don't see anything about it. And if anyone has done the 24 hour quiet and chemical free option what is that about? Is it just like people agree not to party or something? \n\nAlso for food options could someone explain the meal plans. I've seen so far that plan C is the recommended and most common, but I also saw something about $8 a day which does not sound like enough for breakfast lunch, and dinner. Are meals cheap or do most people add extra money? Should I pick plans A or B to be safe or is C fine? What is the food like too? Are there Halal options for students, and alongside that is there like a mosque for people to pray?  \n\n\nFor living in a dorm with people does a cleaner clean the bathrooms and places or is it delegated between people? Do people bring their PCs or should I get a laptop? And if there are any extra tips before coming in I'd love to hear them.",

            "comment": "Not sure about the hosting selection situation, but 24 Hour Quiet basically means that sound can\u2019t leave the vicinity of your room, and Chem Free is no drugs, alcohol, substances, etc at all in the buildings or your dorm. It\u2019s more than no parties. \n\nFor food, the average person gets Meal Plan C, but if you anticipate eating a lot, go for Plans A or B (which is what I personally did). Some food is unnecessarily expensive, so costs can add up quickly. You can always add more during the semester and whatever you use rolls over. \n\nYes, if you live in a floor with corridor style doubles, bathrooms are cleaned daily. If you\u2019re in a suite, they\u2019re cleaned once weekly. Cleaning your room/common area is up to you and your roommates to decide.\n\nI know a few people that keep PCs in their dorms, but everything is digital nowadays and you should probably buy a tablet or a computer for notes and doing stuff when you\u2019re not in the room.",

    "postText": "(just a little rant incoming)\n\nI\u2019m taking HIST/AAAS 106A this summer. When I enrolled, the schedule of classes told me I\u2019d be getting C, G, and N gen ed credits (the C credit attracted me the most, especially because the course isn\u2019t being offered in the fall for some reason even though it typically is). \n\nOn the first day of classes, the syllabus was posted and said we wouldn\u2019t be getting the C credit since you have to take HIST 106B to get it (yet HIST 106B isn\u2019t being offered in the summer or fall). Thinking this may have been a mistake and given my DegreeWorks audit said I\u2019d be getting the C credit, I brushed it off.\n\nHowever, over the past few days, our professor has repeated that we\u2019re not getting the C gen ed despite it being listed on the schedule of classes. I finally decided to email the Gen Ed department on Thursday (conveniently the last day to drop classes as well) for clarification. It\u2019s now Saturday and they haven\u2019t responded. \n\nThe icing on the cake is that when I checked the schedule of classes on Friday (the day after I sent the email) the C gen ed magically disappeared from the listing. It\u2019s not there anymore and now all it says we can get is G or N. \n\nSo now I\u2019m waiting for an email for Gen Ed being like \u201cWhat are you talking about? There\u2019s no C credit under the listing.\u201d\n\nI think 9 people have already dropped the class already too\u2026 fun times.",

            "comment": "Also, you can't get both the G and N, it is either or, because it is traditionally one class = one gen ed req. fulfilled. But all of the available options are listed on the schedule. However, you can get both a writing and a gen ed, so you could've gotten a C and a G, for instance, if the course still had the C attribute on it.",

The reason I\u2019m hellbent on getting the C credit is because the N credit will be fulfilled by my major and I\u2019m taking a G class in the fall\u2026 so literally one of the only reasons I took this class was for the C given Harpur\u2019s more extensive writing requirements. \n\nIf Gen Ed doesn\u2019t have a response by Monday I\u2019m going to email Harpur Advising and see if they could help me out.",

If I had the choice between the two I\u2019d take 106B, but they\u2019re not offering it \ud83d\ude2d At this point I\u2019m guessing them putting C for 106A may have been a mistake, but I know at least half the class signed up just for the C credit so it\u2019s chaos",

The same thing happened to me.  \n\nI went through the process to get my class approved for an N credit, and was told in writing that it had.   But BU Brain listed as a C.   It was an administrative error that took forever to fix.  I sent so many notices to students and made numerous announcements in class.  \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to, but always double check your syllabus.",

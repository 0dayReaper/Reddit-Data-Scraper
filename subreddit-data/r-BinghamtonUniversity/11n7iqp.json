    "postText": "I've been living in Hillside these past 2 semesters, and I was considering moving somewhere else. From what I've seen, UClub is cheaper and much nicer. I pay around $6k per semester at Hillside, while some UClub apartments are around $850 a month. \n\nAm I missing something here? Hillside is not even that much closer to the brain than UClub either. I understand that other apartments are much cheaper, but I'm speaking relative to Hillside.",

But like you said it\u2019s still cheaper than almost every on campus dorm / apartment, you can just find other off campus living for as little at $400 a month",

The cheapest you can probably get is 950 a month if you don\u2019t drive a car. The only catch is it\u2019s a 1 year lease, so you start paying august 1st and stop paying the next year July 31st. You end up paying for a full months rent in august, December, January, may, June and July when you will rarely be in Binghamton. So that sucks\u2026\u2026",

Sure the landlords of Binghamton are shitty but with uclub you\u2019re not getting much better anyway there was always shit broken in my place but they sure tried to charge me for damages after ignoring multiple maintenance requests while I was there\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a one off case but I\u2019d hate to not say anything and u become case #2 lol",

Sure it\u2019s nicer than hillside, but if you want to live off campus move down town. You\u2019ll save a lot more and closer to the night life.",

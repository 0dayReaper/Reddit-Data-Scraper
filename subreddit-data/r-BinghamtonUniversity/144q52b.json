It was really just me and my roommate and then occasionally someone else would use it. I have no clue why other people are saying different, maybe I just got lucky on that floor.",

Worst time for the bathroom is between 9-11 am when most people are getting ready for classes. Don\u2019t expect to wait for the bathroom other than that, it\u2019s really not terrible. If you need to go or shower and they are full it take a 15 second walk to the floor above or below you. Trust it\u2019s not bad I lived there my first two years",

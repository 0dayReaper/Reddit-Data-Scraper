If you could be honest, what do you think are my chances of getting accepted to the SOM with a 1370 sat and 96 UW gpa? also have 8 aps and pretty good extra curriculars. My friend was accepted EA to the SOM with the same aps and SAT, but gpa was 97. Also curious what school you got accepted to if you don't mind sharing.",

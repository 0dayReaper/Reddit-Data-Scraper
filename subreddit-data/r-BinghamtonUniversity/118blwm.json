While riding the blue buses, please check under seats and if you find it, please turn it into campus security or the driver. Not sure if these buses are checked. It was lost Friday night. Thanks!",

I had put it in lost mode so it must have pinged on that end and it was immediately turned off. He and his friend went there but they said they didn't have it and shut the door.",

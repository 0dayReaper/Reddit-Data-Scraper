I thought I wanted to room in CIW, but some people have told me negative things about it, or told me just not to room there period. I was wondering if anyone who lives there (or has lived there in the past) could give me some pros and cons about it. Thanks!",

AFAIK it\u2019s freshmen only, so they tend to market it as a first year bonding thing, but it\u2019s just really not a great building. The other dorms in CIW are renovated, if still a bit old. Mohawk\u2019s more modern compared to the other CIW dorms, but it\u2019s also pretty disconnected from the rest of community.\n\nCIW has a super convenient location on campus since it\u2019s so close to the everything. The only major downside is that the CIW dining hall is closed on weekends, but the Union/Marketplace is very close so it\u2019s not the end of the world.",

I lived there and saw other communities and buildings too. Dickinson/mountainview are for sure nicer but CIW is harmless. The only thing that bothered me was that there\u2019s not rly a communal \u201cquad\u201d if u care about that, and that the dining hall closed on Fridays at 1 and didn\u2019t reopen until Monday morning. U had to travel to a different dining hall, and they aren\u2019t far so it was ok but such an inconvenience. It\u2019s cheaper to live in CIW too though",

I live in cayuga, the bathrooms are really clean/modern and get cleaned everyday and I think it\u2019s a similar situation for Onondaga and Seneca",

But if you have auto insurance, or you are still a dependent minor and your parents have homeowners insurance, I would start there. You can often get discounts for bundling with another policy.\n\nEdit: you may also find [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/renters-insurance/do-i-need-renters-insurance/) useful in figuring out what kind of coverage you need and how much.",

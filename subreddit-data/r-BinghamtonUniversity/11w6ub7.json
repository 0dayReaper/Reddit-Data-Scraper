    "postText": "So I recently got admitted into eop at Binghamton (Watson)and I was wondering what my financial aid may look like and around when it will come in. My stats are: Hispanic, male, 94.41 gpa, 1180 SAT(1200 superscore), 3 AP classes (one in progress), 3 dual enrollment classes, and low income. If anyone got any ideas please comment or PM me, Thank you.",

Check out the cost of attendance calculator on the website. It won\u2019t be perfect but it may be able to give you an idea. Otherwise, make sure you fill out the FAFSA and call the financial aid office if you have any questions",

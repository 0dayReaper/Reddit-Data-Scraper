The notes you get from RVB in class don\u2019t contain enough content to do well on exams.\n\nFor Orgo 1, I would suggest regularly going to success hours to ask questions or just do practice problems. Also do mid and end chapter problems that are provided in course contents. They are really helpful for exams.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m planning my courses to take over the summer and I have the option of either taking Thermodynamics, Engineering Analysis or Measurement and Instrumentation in the fall based on what I take this summer. I\u2019m wondering if anyone would strongly suggest one course over another. And how difficult Measurements and Instrumentation is compared to taking the normal course progression of Thermo or Analysis?\nThank you",

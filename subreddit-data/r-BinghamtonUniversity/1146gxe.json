I'm sure there's a lot more but those are the ones I know off the top of my head.\n\nAlso religious organizations like Hillel (Jewish Org), MSA (Muslim Org), Newman House (Christian Catholic org), HSC (Hindu org). All of the religious organizations also come together once or twice a semester for an interfaith event.",

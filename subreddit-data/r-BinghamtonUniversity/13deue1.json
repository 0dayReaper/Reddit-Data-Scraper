            "comment": "Transferring out could absolutely help, as long as you make sure you can identify what specifically it is about Binghamton that you don\u2019t vibe with and make sure you\u2019re going to be transferring somewhere that really we\u2019ll be a better fit. It will be a hassle though so I would advise that first you look into what you might be able to do at bing to make it a better experience. I know for me it wasn\u2019t until a year in thatI found some extra curricular i liked and that I really started to find my groove. I would look into what\u2019s available on/around campus and try immersing yourself in bing a bit more that way before throwing in the towel.",

The biggest thing is making sure it\u2019s what you want/ need in your life cause then you can do it with no regrets. \n\nIf your looking for things/ people do a class or club or something that interest you or even is something you\u2019ve always wanted to do. I\u2019ve met my favorite people by taking a painting class on a whim and playing in club softball. Even a job that I got while here I met my closest friends ( on campus and off ) \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be amazing where ever you go and best of luck where ever life takes you !",

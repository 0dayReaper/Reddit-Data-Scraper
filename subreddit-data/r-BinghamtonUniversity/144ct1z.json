    "postText": "I will be attending the orientation on July 20-21 and will most likely be taking flixbus. This is my first time traveling alone this far away from home, so I am looking for anyone in the same situation who\u2019d like to travel together to lessen the nerves. \n\nBut if anyone has any open space on a car ride there and won\u2019t mind an extra passenger, I would love to tag along. I can pitch in for gas or any other fees if needed.\n\nEdit: Traveling from Brooklyn",

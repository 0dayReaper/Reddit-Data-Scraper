            "comment": "What class did you fail? If it was nursing or science related, forget it. Sorry. A good number of students do fail, because it is very hard. You will find another calling and look back at this time as a blessing that put you on a new path. \n\nWas it a different prerequisite? Make an appointment to talk to a nursing advisor IN PERSON (not phone, not email. Use Zoom ONLY if the advisor insists.) and see if there is any shred of possibility of retaking the class and reapplying. Dress professionally, don\u2019t make excuses, do not blame the professor, and take personal responsibility. \u201cYou probably knew you were failing early on in the course and should have sought intervention then.\u201d That\u2019s what they are going to say to you IF they give you a meeting. How will you answer? Make a plan for what you will do to pass the course. Meet with the professor/department head for the failed class too. \n\nAbove all: Be prepared to hear \u201cno\u201d as an answer. Take some time to come up with a backup plan. You already said Psych, or you could look into public health or social work too. This isn\u2019t the end, but a different beginning.",

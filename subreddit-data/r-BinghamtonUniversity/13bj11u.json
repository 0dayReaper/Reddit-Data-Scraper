    "postText": "Hi, I'm applying to be a supplemental instruction leader for next semester. I was wondering if anyone was one and if they have any advice on what it's like or what to put on my application. Is it more of a tutoring job or something more? I know the basics of the position of course, but I've never had to attend an SI lesson because I simply haven't needed them.\n\nAnything helps. Thank you!",

I\u2019ve been to an SI session for Bio 113 and the instructor mainly just went over questions and answered any questions we had. For bio 114 the instructor basically went over his own slides and it was like a lecture without all the useless crap we talk about in the actual lecture. So I guess it depends on the SI?",

You meet 3 times a week for lecture and then once for discussion. I had a great TA (Tony Chen) and he made the class a breeze. Never went to lecture, only discussion, and got an A-, so it ain\u2019t bad, and I\u2019m terrible in math (got a B for Calc).\n\nIt\u2019s a manageable class but your grade is based on your quiz, exam and final grades only. There\u2019s homework but it doesn\u2019t count towards your grade.",

If I didn\u2019t have a good TA the tests would\u2019ve been really bad because sometimes the professor starts using mathematical notations for no damn reason and gives a complicated ass equation that isn\u2019t even necessary. \n\nThe class might\u2019ve changed though, I took him during the fall semester.",

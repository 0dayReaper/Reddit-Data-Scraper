    "postText": "Can anyone who transferred in the past or have gotten transfer decisions let me know what date they've gotten their decisions? I submitted my application as a transfer for fall 23 a month or so ago, haven't gotten a response yet after i submitted the course progress report, is this normal? Should i just chalk it up as a rejection since the commitemnt deadline is May 1 and move on? Has anyone who transferred in the past got an acceptance this late or later?",

For the more competitive schools like Decker and Watson, a lot of freshmen and transfers have gotten waitlisted since they got a big amount of applicants.

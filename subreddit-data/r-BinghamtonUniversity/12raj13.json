                    "comment": "Dickinson is almost exclusively suite-type dorms, which are like mini apartments. Suite style dorms have a few rooms, a bathroom or two, and a common area. As a result, most people socialize within their suite as opposed to with their neighbors or floor. Some parts of mountainview, Hinman, and CIW also have suites. Another factor is that housing priority is decided by credits, so people with more credits will get the newer and nicer buildings. Students that have more credits (usually, not always) tend to be less social and focus more on schoolwork, so as a result the newer buildings are less social. That being said, I\u2019m sure if you make an effort you could contribute to a social environment in any building",

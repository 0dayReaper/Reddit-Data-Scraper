They also have mandated tutoring and check in sessions once a week or so to make sure you\u2019re keeping up with the workload in a new environment.",

It just means they see potential in you and think you'd be able to blossom in a better/more supportive environment, and now you're being judged against all the other applicants in that category. If you weren't a good candidate they'd probably just reject you outright.\n\nShould you get into Binghamton (or any school) via EOP or HEOP, just know that nobody will notice or care that you're in it, so you don't have to worry about not fitting in with the rest of the student body or anything like that",

Graduated in 2021 and it was a supportive community esp my freshmen and sophomore years. Yes u do take summer classes but you can build ur gpa earlier than regular admins do and you also get book stipends",

            "comment": "Students are only considered for EOP if they applied for EOP consideration.  You probably indicated on your application that you wanted to be reviewed as such.  There are times counselors may move an application into a different pool if the student doesn\u2019t qualify for the strict EOP qualifications or if they won\u2019t necessarily be the best fit for the program.  This typically only happens in cases where the student won\u2019t get any benefit academically from the program or does not fit the financial criteria.\n\nThe most important takeaway here is that if you applied EOP, you are considered for this program first and THEN regular admission if you don\u2019t qualify, not the other way around!\n\nI knows it\u2019s confusing, but it is not a bad thing that you were asked to move forward with EOP.  You would have requested this program at the time you applied, and the counselors want to take your preference into account.  That being said, you are welcome to opt out any time and have your application reviewed normally if you want.  But then you won\u2019t get the benefits of EOP.  It\u2019s 100% your choice until a decision is released.",

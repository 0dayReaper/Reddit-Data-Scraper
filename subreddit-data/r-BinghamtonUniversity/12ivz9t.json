Also the final is sometimes written by the prof of a different section, so heads up for that. This semester Biddle is teaching a section and that man is a god-send, sign up for his section if you can",

And fortunately, row reduction doesn't involve any complicated calculations or anything- at worst it's just tedious and may involve some trial and error. \n\nYou'll just have to learn to get good at it early on, because a lot of the questions in 304 will require you to reduce a matrix as just one step out of many. Yeah if my memory serves me right, 304 is far more tedious than it is difficult",

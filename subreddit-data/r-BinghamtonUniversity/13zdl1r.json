    "postText": "Housing Recommendation: DO NOT RENT WITH JIM SLOCUM OR BEARCAT HOUSING\n\nI know it\u2019s getting time to start looking for housing next year for students and alumni, ***please please please*** research your landlord. \n\nBinghamton, as well as a majority of other college towns, tend to begin the college off-campus housing process SUPER early, as in signed and deposited for your apartment for next year before November. \n\nGoogle the LLC, Google the landlord, Google the number you\u2019re communicating with. There are so many slumlords in Binghamton in general and it\u2019s easy to get caught.\n\nI had Jim Slocum as a landlord and it was god awful. So glad I never rented again.\n\nAsk your friends, ask Reddit, use [https://openigloo.com/landing](https://openigloo.com/landing), [https://wyl.co/property/jimmy-slocum](https://wyl.co/property/jimmy-slocum), Whose Your Landlord, anything.\n\nThis is a PSA to be smart! They take advantage of college students in any college neighborhood.",

Nothing major broke in our time there, and he actually did fix a couple minor things. But mostly we just fixed whatever ourself. The good part was we actually did substantial damage to the house and he didn't catch any of it on the security deposit, so you can actually get some good things out of his negligance.",

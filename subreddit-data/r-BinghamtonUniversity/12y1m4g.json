    "postText": "hi! I'm going to be a freshman at stony brook this fall, but I'm considering to transfer here for my sophomore year. And I know that people always say to wait and experience your first semester first before jumping to conclusions, but this school was my first choice (even though they deferred and then rejected me!) and stony isn't well known for my intended finance major. I know that bing has a good som program, but ofc, it's hard to get in!! However, I want to know my chances and what I should be focusing on my first semester to get in here as well as how I should be planning to do within the coming months.",

If you don't get in, you can apply for an intra university transfer (IUT), although it is competitive. Worst case scenario, you can do an Economics major in Harpur.",

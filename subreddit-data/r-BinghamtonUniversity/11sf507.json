I\u2019ve personally had the most luck meeting people from my major. I met two of my close friends through a study group I had made for one of my classes and some other friends through lab group work. There are so so many people at this school, unfortunately you just gotta go for it sometimes (sorry, I know that\u2019s probably not exactly what you want to hear :/)",

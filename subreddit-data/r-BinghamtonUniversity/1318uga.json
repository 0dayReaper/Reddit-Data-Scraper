    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming junior transfer in the upcoming Fall semester. For context, I didn\u2019t have a traditional college experience as I did two years in community and graduate in two weeks with my associates. \nI kinda feel like I should pledge a frat? If any of you have experience with that either as a frat member or someone on the outside, I\u2019d really appreciate your perspectives.",

You can always find a party where you don\u2019t need to be a brother to get in and tbh the hazing stories I\u2019ve heard are just nasty. There are definitely some good frats though that don\u2019t do that you should just really ask around but if the only reason you want to is to make friends there are many other clubs that provide close-nit environments to meet people. Also Binghamton holds a few transfer events for students to meet each other and create friends. Good luck with whatever you decide hope you have a great semester!",

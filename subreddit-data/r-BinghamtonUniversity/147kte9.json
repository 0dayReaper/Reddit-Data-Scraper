    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m an international student travelling to the US for the first time. \n\nI\u2019m planning on coming to the US on Aug 14. My flight would land at JFK between 6-7 in the evening and the university bus is at 8PM and I might not be able to catch it because of immigration check. \n\nWhat are the other means of transport to reach the college campus? I found few buses but I'm not sure if they'd drop me at college campus. Can someone pls let me know what to do and  drop useful links\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks so much ",

It leaves Port Auth around 10.30 pm. Do check online. \n\nAlso, if you have a lot of luggage do consider taking a yellow cab to Manhattan. The yellow cabs have a flat fare of $70 from JFK to Manhattan.",

From there you can catch the 15 bus to campus, or if it is too late at night you might have to call an uber or lyft.\n\nOurbus costs from $18 to $30 or more (one way) depending on the date and time. It has an app where you can schedule your bus ticket beforehand. You can also find some discount coupons for first timers for that app.",

Frankly BC transit is terrible later at night until the school year starts and I wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck at the downtown Binghamton terminal or Port Authority terminal with all my international travel luggage if I were you.\n\nThe other option is to inform an immigration officer that you have a tight connection and show them your printed reservation for the bus to Binghamton. Ask them if the line is longer than the bus departure. They\u2019ll likely expedite you if you\u2019re cutting it close, but it\u2019s not guaranteed.",

I have the same feeling about orientation but recently I got an email about preorientation virtual meet-up with an academic advisor to make a schedule and discuss path to graduation. So now really the only use for orientation is to pick up your photo card which is ridiculous as some people don't live near the school and driving all that hours for a photo card is insane. But ik pretty sure we can just pick up our card when school starts anyways.",

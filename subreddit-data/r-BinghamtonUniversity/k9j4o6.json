Some guy named Brian wrote an email asking a question about how to transfer into Watson, presumably intending to send it to an advisor, but it somehow was sent to literally everyone in Harpur college instead. Three minutes later he emailed an apology. Its not really clear how he managed to do this.\n\nMy roommate and I were laughing ourselves sick over the whole thing. The longer you think about it the funnier it gets. Like, how did he manage to do this? This is the kinda mistake this guy will be thinking about for the rest of his life, lying awake at night being embarrassed about it or whatever. Literally a decade from now, some buddy of his will be like \"Hey, remember that time you emailed all of Harpur college?\" If he sees a therapist he'll probably talk to them about it. And meanwhile no one really cares and we're making memes about it. Next semester, I guarantee any classmates he has will be like \"oh my God are you *the* Brian?\" Its just the silly, ridiculous kind of event that we all needed to laugh about in the middle of finals. And somehow the fact that his name is Brian just makes it funnier.",

I have been taking the prerequisite\u00a0courses\u00a0but I am unsure of the process of how to apply. Please let me know what I can possibly do to further this process as I would like to try and get this done before the end of this semester. Thank you for all the help and I hope you have a good evening and a good rest of the week.\n&gt;Brian [lastname]\n\nHe also included his B#.\n\nAnd then, a few minutes later,\n\n&gt;I AM SORRY TO EVERYONE IT WAS BY MISTAKE!!!!!",

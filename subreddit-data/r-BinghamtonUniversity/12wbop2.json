    "postText": "Hi all! I was just wondering how quiet 24 hour quiet living is in Susquehanna. I\u2019m coming in as a transfer and if there are spots left I would love to be in Susquehanna rather than hillside, but I was wondering how quiet people realistically expect it to be. Like would my roommates and I get yelled at if we were laughing a bit too loudly sometimes while hanging out? Or is it more like \u2018no loud parties and no yelling\u2019, I guess it also has to do with how thin the walls are but yeah, if anyone has advice or experience in Susquehanna quiet living I would appreciate it.",

            "comment": "First of all, no one gets \u201cyelled at,\u201d this isn\u2019t prison. No you wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for laughing loudly but don\u2019t be hooting and hollering past 12am. And you should never be blasting music, ever, in a quiet community so yea you probably shouldn\u2019t have a party there. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear your neighbor/roommates conversation talking at a normal level by putting your ear to the wall. My neighbor likes to blast music in the morning and nighttime, must be a sadistic sleeping routine. Anyway, don\u2019t be an inconsiderate a-hole and you should be fine. I\u2019ve found most of the apartments must\u2019ve lived in a spacious house their entire life with no concept of neighbors on the other side of the wall. As someone who\u2019s always lived in thin walled apartments, it\u2019s really fucking annoying to say the least, living in a quiet community. I have no issues with partying, but I go out downtown to do that. Not 1am on a weeknight in susquehanna keeping the surrounding 7 apartments awake",

Yeah when I said yelled at it was rhetorical, and I don\u2019t like parties in my own space and obviously that would be rude bc it\u2019s literally called quiet living but I just wanted to make sure i wouldn\u2019t have to live as quiet as a mouse, but again thank you for the response :)",

The quiet living part of Susq is enforced by complaints, there isn't someone who is constantly walking around checking if you are being too noisy throughout the day.  You should not be having a loud party in a quiet living community, but I think that is just common sense.",

                    "comment": "100% agree and yeah the only reason I asked about getting 'yelled at' per se is because I saw in quiet living people can send in complaints about noise (as you said) and tell you to quiet down and there can be action to move you out of the residential hall. I'm an introverted person and quiet in my current apartment style dorm but I got anxious about noise level rules anyways which is why I came on here and asked what people expect, but thank you for responding :)",

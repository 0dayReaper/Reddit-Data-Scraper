            "comment": "When you meet with an advisor after orientation they'll go over what classes you should take/register for. My guess is you'll be in anywhere from 14-18 cr., 16 cr. is a typical schedule but I think some SCHL classes are 2 cr. so I'm not sure. But those two classes and potentially a CHEM major class. \n\nYou may be able to jump into Orgo Chem based on your APs (not saying you should, but your 4 covers all of Gen Chem according to this page, i.e. CHEM 111: https://www.binghamton.edu/harpur/advising/transfer-credit/ap-equivalencies/index.html). Then you'll have probably one gen ed/writing/elective course. FRI and CHEM will probably be difficult so don't overwhelm yourself, esp your first semester",

            "comment": "A four on AP Chem will get you out of Gen Chem 1 (Chem 107) which you would typically take in the fall. As a Chem major, you would also typically start w calc in your first semester but depending on what you pull on the AP, you may test out of certain calc classes. As I see it now, since you\u2019re already enrolled in two classes (SCHL and FRI) you have two slots left, where it may be in ur best interest to take a gen Ed/writing course and a course for your major. I believe you need physics for the Chem Major so you could even start with that in the fall; however, when you meet w an advisor during orientation, they will go over all this with you. \n\nYou can find all the degree requirements for all the iterations of the Chem major on the department website, and you can find helpful resources for building your schedule on the Harpur Academic Advising webpage.",

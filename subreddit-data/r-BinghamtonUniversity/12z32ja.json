    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an admitted student at Bing, and I\u2019m currently in the process of deciding between Bing and Fordham. I plan on majoring in English. \nI was originally planning on going to Williams College, but because of financial complications, I am now considering Bing/Fordham. Williams has a \"better\" department/program according to various college ranking sites and my own experience, and I am unsure about certain aspects of Bing in general. For example, coming from someone who wanted to go to an LAC, I value personal relationships with professors. Will I be able to make those connections as an English major at Bing? Furthermore, will I be taking large lecture courses as an English major? If so, will that be for all four years or only Freshman year? Lastly, I noticed that the course requirements seemed pretty restrictive for the English major (i.e., a lot of the courses seemed heavily focused on British literature). Are there alternative courses I can take as a Freshman?\nTo clarify, I\u2019m not really asking if I should go to Bing vs. Fordham. Rather, I\u2019m hoping to have a better understanding of the English major experience at Bing. If you have any other suggestions or things that you think I should know, please do share. Thanks!",

            "comment": "In my experience, the English department has been pretty good. All of the teachers I have had have been great and always super open to talk during office hours. The classes can range in size from about 20-100 people depending on if you are taking an elective for the major or if you are taking the core classes. Generally, you would take the larger classes freshman and sophomore year. There are a lot of cross listed classes that can still count towards the English major, so topics can range from cinema, ancient history, philosophy, etc. While the easier route would be to take the core classes like British Literature and American literature, there are occasionally other courses that may focus on a more specific area within those topics that would still count towards those core requirements. Overall, it is a pretty easy major to complete which could allow you to double major or take on a minor if you choose.",

            "comment": "\nIt's very easy to build close relationships with the professors. They're always shouting out opportunities and events going on and will sometimes personally reccomend you submit something somewhere, etc. As long as you're participating in class you can count on having a good relationship.\n\nMost lectures are only for the requirements - Shakespeare, American lit, etc. 90% of other English classes are 15 - 30 people. This is especially true of upper level classes or classes in more niche topics. If you really want to avoid lectures for your English classes, it's definitely doable. On the English major requirements website there should be a link that says course substitutions - this will bring you to a list of alternative classes you can take to supplement the traditional requirements. These classes are often smaller, more interesting, and lass standardized since they aren't repeated every year like the traditional requirements are.\n\nIt's also not the end of the world if you're in a lecture - you still have the opportunity to build a close relationship with your professor, you just have to work a bit harder to stand out. Of all the English classes Ive taken it was the professor of a lecture class that I knew could write me the best letter of recommendation, even tho 95% of the other classes id taken at that point were small discussions.\n\nHope this helps",

            "comment": "Bing English major here. Yes I have had some bigger lectures but most of the time those come with smaller discussion classes as well. I use rate my prof when registering and it\u2019s worked out for me so far. This year I\u2019ve had all smaller classes and I\u2019ve really enjoyed them. Also with the diversity I feel like it depends on which English major you are specifically also keeping in mind that Bing is a PWI. I will say that other major departments are stronger and more helpful that English but I\u2019ve done just fine. Good luck :) !",

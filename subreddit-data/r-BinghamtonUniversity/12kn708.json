    "postText": "One of my professors just started giving out grades for the first two projects yesterday. I haven\u2019t gotten any grades yet this semester and other classmates haven\u2019t either. I reached out for my grade but haven\u2019t heard anything back. Is this normal to wait till the end of the semester to give out grades? Would he had to let us know if we weren\u2019t doing well enough before the pass/fail period? The semester is over in a few weeks\u2026 thanks for your advice! \ud83d\ude0a",

Typically I have at least 2 grades in for major assignments by this point in the semester, plus smaller grades.\nI don't know if you're in harpur or Watson etc and if it varies by school but I would definitely reach out to your prof and ask where you stand in the class as well as when you can expect to get your grades back.",

We\u2019ve handed in the projects he has all the deliverables for months. I think he should have definitely graded them as he received them. He also just randomly stopped updating his schedule that he used to update every week about a month ago. I\u2019ve also scheduled appointments with him and he\u2019s reached out to me 45 minutes late and said \u201csorry are you free now?\u201d But I had been Long go after searching the department for him. A second time told me he would be there in a few minutes and then just didn\u2019t show up for over two hours so I had to go find him in his office. It\u2019s definitely a strange situation with the lack of basic professionalism like you said. Who do you go to in a situation like this?",

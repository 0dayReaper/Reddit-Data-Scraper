    "postText": "I'm interested in the school and have overall heard good things about it. A few things:\n\n1. How easy is it to make friends here? I am a social person and always open to new connections. Will it be easy to find other people like that?\n2. What general kinds of kids go here? How would you describe the community? Social? Nerdy/intellectual? Party people?\n3. How well does the school keep the community close and bring new students together?\n4. How is the party life? Love a good party, but is there lots of pressure to partake all the time?\n5. Are there activities on campus held to connect people? Are there dances, meetups, traditions, and festivities happening commonly? How do people have fun here?\n6. What is the workload like? No time to relax? Too much time? Balanced? No work?\n7. Are the clubs/orgs active?\n8. What do you do for fun here?\n9. Is there an active community for queer people to feel like they belong/are not an outsider? I'm a queer man, so I'd love to have other queer people to connect with socially. What's the local community like in terms of support for queer ppl and overall safety? Let me know what you think, and please be as honest as possible. Thank you for your time!",

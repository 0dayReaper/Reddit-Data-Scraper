    "postText": "Hi!  \nI'll be attending orientation over the summer, but I just wanted to double check I'd be allowed to drive myself there and leave my car on the campus while I'm at orientation. Idk why I'm paranoid about this as I'm literally a rising freshman at college, but I'm so used to having to go with parents so I just wanted to double check.  \nThanks!",

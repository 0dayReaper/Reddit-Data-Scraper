    "postText": "I have been put into a waitlist and I had applied for an MS in CS in early December. Now, I have also been given an option to go for MS in Information Systems. Should I accept it and try to transfer to CS once I get there or should I wait for their decision for CS? I don't know if I should just consider their non-decision as an automatic reject anymore or if there are any chances of getting an admit/a deferred admit. I have put other offers on hold as CS at BU has been my main choice of program, as an international applicant.",

I could be wrong about this.\n\nMay I ask what your undergraduate degree was, and what career path you want to follow after graduation? This may explain why you got an MSIS admission instead of a MSCS admission.",

But unfortunately, she said she wasn't sure about this. I tried looking up the contact of an advisor after reading your message and found one for a \"Graduate Student Services Specialist\" in the Applied Science department. Do you know if this is the right person to be contacted for this?\n\n&gt;May I ask what your undergraduate degree was, and what career path you want to follow after graduation? This may explain why you got an MSIS admission instead of a MSCS admission.\n\nUndergrad was in ECE 5 years back. I got drawn to CS towards the end of it because of interest and ended up working on some projects related to computer vision and programming. I have been working as a software dev for close to 5 years now. Reason I chose CS was because I wanted to strengthen my knowledge of algorithms while also working on Computer Vision in the meanwhile and pursue a career in Computer Vision eventually. IS has none of this and I am not sure why they think it'd be more appropriate for me.",

At worst, she will probably refer you to the person at MSIS who can actually answer your question about either transferring or getting your admissions offer moved to MSCS. \n\nBased on your goals, you definitely won\u2019t be well served by MSIS, and if they can\u2019t move you to MSCS, you should take another offer.\n\nI don\u2019t know why they put you in MSIS in the first place. If I had to guess, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t have a CS degree and upon looking at your transcript it might be missing courses that are good indicators of future success. I hear we get lots of CS-adjacent applicants who want the CS degree for career outlook reasons but end up not doing well because they lack certain background courses. I actually taught a course last semester to teach basic C coding for students in over their heads in a Programming Language Theory course. \n\nIn your case, I would really emphasize that you have practical employment experience in software engineering and hope they can move your offer over.",

That's the contact I found from a quick search.\n\n&gt;At worst, she will probably refer you to the person at MSIS who can actually answer your question about either transferring or getting your admissions offer moved to MSCS.\n\nI haven't yet been admitted to any of the programs, by the way. I contacted the admissions office to know about the status of my CS app and they mentioned in the email asking me if I'd be interested in applying to IS, as they think it'd be more suitable for me. Would you still recommend me to contact the advisor in question here (Pamela) or would you recommend I contact the person in the admissions office that I have been in touch with, up until now?\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t know why they put you in MSIS in the first place. If I had to guess, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t have a CS degree and upon looking at your transcript it might be missing courses that are good indicators of future success.\n\nI did have a low GPA in ECE. I'm starting to think they had a look at that as the deciding factor. Post graduation, I tried to make up for my deficit courses in CS by taking many courses away from college and by writing exams to earn certifications, and ended up getting a job as a developer. I was also working on a few projects in the meanwhile. \n\n&gt;In your case, I would really emphasize that you have practical employment experience in software engineering and hope they can move your offer over.\n\nI have mentioned about it in my personal statement. But I think I missed a trick by not mentioning about the certificates that I have earned, in my resume. Hope it didn't end up hurting my chances.",

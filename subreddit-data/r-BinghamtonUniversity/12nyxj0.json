    "postText": "Hello! I have an internship nearby Binghamton University and I'm just wondering how the night-life is nearby in the surrounding area (and even on campus) over the summer. I would assume that there are significantly less young-people in the area over the summer but is there basically no one? \n\nThank you.",

Also to answer your on campus part, it\u2019s pretty much dead except when orientations are going on. Ofc there are a few people here and there hanging around too",

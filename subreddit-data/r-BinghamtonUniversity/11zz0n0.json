She's currently a decorated professor, has her Master's, PHd, and is one of the most awesome instructors this campus has. \n\nAs some others have suggested, maybe try a semester at SUNY Broome Community College. As a BCC alum who went on to school here at BU and had huge success, it's a very good community college (personally: some of the courses I took at BCC were more challenging then what I took at BU. It did a great job of preparing me to come here). \n\nFurthermore, the relationship between BCC and Binghamton University is only being strengthened further (you may have heard of the merger). Finally, if memory serves me correctly, I think the credit transfer between the schools is 100%; meaning whatever you take at BCC will transfer to BU.",

One thing to note is that if you were to apply to Bing _today_, you\u2019d be admitted as a spring 2024 admit. The CCs will let you enroll much closer to the start of the semester.",

    "postText": "Im only asking and think it\u2019s important because I asked him to write a letter for a few summer programs (one very last minute even though he had already written the letter for the other programs but I sensed that he was upset), and now I need to ask him again for my med school applications. I feel really bad and I\u2019m actually kind of scared to ask him to write the letter for med school. I was thinking to get him a gift and then ask him but my friends thinks it looks like i\u2019m bribing him and that it\u2019s not necessary. So I know there are some professors in this subreddit, so what do you think? (students too)",

It is annoying to get a request at the last minute, but if I've already written one for a student it's not a big deal. We've got feelings too and it's not always easy to hide the fact that we've got lots of work but still do care about students.\n\nIf you want to be considerate, write a thank-you card. Even if it's two or three sentences. Those are well-loved by faculty who receive them. In fact, anyone reading this, in any circumstance: give your letter of recommendation writers a thank-you card.",

And then just...something specific and honest, like tell them what their class or mentorship or whatever means to you. Or how excited you are about med school. Like I said, 2-3 sentences is fine unless you're very close, then...4-5 sentences? It's a card.",

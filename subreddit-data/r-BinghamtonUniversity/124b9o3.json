    "postText": "I was accepted to Binghamton fall of 2023 and currently, it\u2019s my top choice. My only worry right now is dorms. If you're a current student, would you recommend looking for people online to try to find roommates or do random? And is there any advice you can give on the whole process? I'm very introverted and I find it hard to start conversations and take initiative in these types of matters.",

I was in the CIW Politics, Law, and Society learning community last year and met some great people and a great roommate. \n* Post on the Facebook group and Instagram account for the Binghamton Class of 2027 account. Mention what you like to do, favorite shows/music, etc. It's a great way to make friends\n* If anything, there is definitely also the housing portal OR scoring a single within a Dickinson flat like someone else mentioned",

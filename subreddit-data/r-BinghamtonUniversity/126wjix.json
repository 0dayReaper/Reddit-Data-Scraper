    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to get my B credit filled next semester but a lot of the classes are swimming, weight training, etc. As a trans student part-way through medically transitioning, a lot of these are making me hesitant. Does anyone know any B-credit classes that don't require you to go into locker rooms and don't do any class activities that separate by gender? Thanks in advance!",

I\u2019m order to classify as a B it needs to fulfill both the Y and S which is physical activity and wellness. \nWhen I was still at Bing I took wellness through aerobics and we never had to go in the locker room. I went to class already dressed in the clothes I was going to wear for that class as did the majority of the class. The class itself wasn\u2019t separated by gender either.",

I am not trans/non binary or part of LGBTQ+ community but Tina (the professor with dog was very friendly, kind, welcoming and understanding). The other professor I had was nice, her teaching method was different than Tina's, so I was a bit uncomfortable (ex. she requested socks off in the classroom)",

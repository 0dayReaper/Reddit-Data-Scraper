    "postText": "I will be attending Binghamton after my gap year, and was wondering, in terms of dorm space/layouts and common room space/layouts are better between Mountain View and Dickinson? Or just overall what differs between the two? I\u2019m worried about feeling too crammed in and am not big on not having much room to breathe in(basically I\u2019m a introvert in that nature\ud83d\ude2d) but I also am looking for whichever community between the two is friendliest and easier to socialize and make friends because that\u2019s important to me too, even though I\u2019m introverted I don\u2019t want to feel disconnected if that makes sense? \n\nAlso, I checked out the Binghamton website already and got more info about residential life but am looking for more input because I\u2019m still stuck between choosing ;) much appreciated!",

            "comment": "Mountainview has a common room, basically a living room. Dickinson technically has one but it\u2019s non-existent, it\u2019s just a hallway to access the rooms. That being said Dickinson is newer than Mountainview, and Dickinson has 3 study lounges on each floor. I currently dorm in dickinson so if you have more specific questions feel free to DM \n\nIn terms of making friends, it mainly depends on what you do!",

Honestly, I like the living room idea better for mountainview and it seems to be both reserved but friendly at the same time but that is only my assumption. I\u2019d love to know more about Dickinson though cause I\u2019ve heard it being recommended over and over for residential living but I\u2019m still not sure, I love different things about both Mountainview and Dickinson. But I certainly will keep that in mind and I really appreciate it :)",

    "postText": "Was taking a look at the times for labs like CHEM 335 and BCHM 425 in past semesters and they seem to be about 4 hours long. For those who have actually taken these courses, do they really go until the entire 4 hours or in most cases you were let out early? I was not expecting for them to be that long lol",

There are days in each of those labs where I was in lab for more than 3 hours. Organic lab I usually was done after 2.5 hours, analytical depends on the experiment, and molecular genetics is almost always more than 3 hours.",

There are some labs that require a lot of waiting and if you mess up or something just goes wrong, you\u2019ll probably be there the whole time. If you read the manual beforehand and come prepared, you could probably (almost) always leave after 2-2.5 hours. Having a good TA helps too because you can ask them questions if need be. I also took 422, but that\u2019s a bit different because it\u2019s two 3 hour sessions per week (that one sucked)",

    "postText": "Hi :) I'm an incoming freshman and I will be staying at Endicott in Newing. I was wondering if anyone has a gaming pc and if so how do you fit it with your desk? Is there room in the leg section under the table for you to put your pc or do you have to put it on the desk? Also, how realistic is it to have a large mouse pad on the desk? Last thing id like to know is how many electric outlets are there in a room and also how many ethernet ports there are in a room?\n\nThank you so much :)",

The desk has drawers built in, so it's a choice of either the table or the floor. For deskmats, I have an xl hyperx (900mmx420mm), which fits the table perfectly lengthwise. \n\nIf you're in a double, there should be an ethernet port on one side of the room, so you'd probably need to ask your roommate. There are more than enough outlets in the room, but I still recommend getting an extension cord.",

            "comment": "My roommate in Dickinson used to keep his pc under his bed (either that, or between the bed and desk) and that seemed to work well, also a large mousepad might be tough, most of the dorm\ndesks at the school have the drawers on the left side of your legs so you kinda sit on the right side of it if that makes sense, Razer makes a nice small thin black pad I used. You\u2019ll definitely want a surge protector/extension cord to plug multiple things in if you have a lot of stuff, and there\u2019s one ethernet port per room usually, if you and your roommate both plan on using it or if you have multiple devices that will use ethernet, you\u2019ll need an Ethernet switch/gigabit switch to be able to have multiple things wired up at once",

Worked pretty well as I left it on, whenever I\u2019d have to turn it off or on thoroughly I\u2019d have to go under my bed to do all that which was annoying but a minor issue.",

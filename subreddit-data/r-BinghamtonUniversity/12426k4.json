    "postText": "I'm a second semester sophomore, psychology major, interested in transferring to Binghamton for fall 2023. I currently attend SUNY Oneonta. I'm miserable here. I went to community my first year of school and got a 3.23 GPA. I transferred to Oneonta and my mental health completely declined because I'm so unhappy with the atmosphere, which severely affected my work ethic and grades. Last semester I got a 2.86 GPA which I'm so disappointed in because I know I can do so much better. This semester I'm working so hard and I know my GPA will be a lot higher, bringing it well above a 3.2. The only problem is, I'm not sure if I wait too long for my spring grades to come out if it'll be too late to apply to Bing and make a decision. I don't want to apply right now because I'm not sure I'd get in. I emailed transfer admissions but they were no help, only saying that transfer admissions are open for right now and are subject to change. There's no official deadline although I know priority deadline was March 15th, so I missed that. My question is, will I be able to get in right now? If not, will I be waiting too long and miss the deadline if I wait to apply until mid-May? If anyone has any information please let me know. I don't want to waste $50 applying if there's no chance of me getting in. Google says many different GPA requirements, I'm not sure which is accurate. If I won't get in and I miss the deadline, my only other option is to continue Oneonta online next semester and apply for spring 2024, which I really don't want to do. Please if anyone has any insight let me know",

It\u2019s easier to get in when you\u2019re a transfer with a decent gpa, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been here. Hope that helps!",

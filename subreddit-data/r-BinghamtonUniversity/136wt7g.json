    "postText": "Make sure to make any changes to your schedule before the deadline. Once pre-registration closes, you cannot add, drop, or waitlist Fall 2023 courses until add/drop at the beginning of the Fall 2023 semester. If you have already waitlisted for a course (or multiple), you will remain on the waitlist and it will \"freeze\" in the interim time, then be re-activated again come add/drop.\n\nHowever, Summer 2023 registration should still remain open (from what I know). The add/drop deadlines for Summer 2023 can be found [here.](https://www.binghamton.edu/academics/summer/calendar.html)\n\n**The semester withdrawal deadline is also tomorrow!**\n\n**Medical withdrawal deadline: May 4th, 4:00pm**\n\n**Self/administrative withdrawal deadline: May 4th, 11:59pm**\n\nHarpur Academic Advising is available for scheduling help tomorrow with appointment times between 9:00am - 4:00pm, and walk-ins from the hours of 10:00am - 12:00pm, and 2:00pm - 4:00pm. Check-ins for walk-in appointments begin a half-hour before the walk-in start time, and it is first-come, first-serve.\n\nYou can also contact the office using the information [here](https://www.binghamton.edu/harpur/advising/index.html) either by phone or email for *brief* questions.",

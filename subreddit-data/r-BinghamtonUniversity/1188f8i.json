It is EXTREMELY hard to get into Watson (for engineering or CS) or SOM if you were originally admitted into Bing as a Harpur student. Scholars students get to choose to take select courses which are only available to them. Some students do both FRI and scholars.",

You get a relatively earlier time for picking classes, lots of free program run events like brunches or hikes, and there are some additional research programs within the scholars program that are honestly really cool. There's even a $3,500 grant for research/study abroad it's really cool. All scholars have to live in Broome Hall their first year but honestly it was a great way to make friends with other students in the program and you can move out in your second year. There's definitely a few more perks I'm forgetting but I think I got the gist down. You can message me if you have any other questions or just reply to this post.",

I was wondering if Binghamton scholars housing is free? And are there any ways that I can pay my tuition fee by working on/off campus?",

Can anyone tell me about this layout or if it\u2019s any different than a normal 2 person dorm? Also is there a way to change your room type cause I\u2019m kinda regretting not picking the four person flat with individual rooms.",

Also the bathroom was pretty big. You\u2019ll be able to meet people the first week, in your classes and in clubs. I think having a roommate your first year can also be good because you have someone to navigate your first year with. It was a good experience for me.",

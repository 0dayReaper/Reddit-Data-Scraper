If you\u2019re going to sit at a library computer desk without even waking up or logging onto the computer, why not choose one of those other desks instead of preventing somebody who needs to use a desktop from being able to access it. :)",

Also, I\u2019m not really sure where you\u2019re getting \u201crelics\u201d from. All of those computers are updated and work fine. If no students used those computers, then stations would not be a resource in demand, even with the half dozen or so tied up by people who need a sleeping computer as a study buddy.",

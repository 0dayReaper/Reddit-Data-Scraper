    "postText": "The only thing that my portal says was received was my transcript\u2026? Is this normal? Most schools would show that my teachers recommendation, counselor recommendation, SAT score, etc. were received. But Binghamton is literally just showing me one thing, which is my transcript. I also submitted my SRAR, but that\u2019s also not recorded on the status\u2026I was also about to do EOP, but there were no forms (I ended up opting out though because my grades were too high). Is anyone\u2019s portal like that as well for Binghamton?",

            "comment": "That is normal! Your official transcript overrides SRAR, so that\u2019s why they\u2019re not both on there. If you chose to use test scores, that should also appear on the checklist, either as a green check if it\u2019s been received or a red x if not.  Letters of rec will not appear on your checklist.  A counselor will reach out to you directly if there are additional materials required when they go to review your application. Until then, if your checklist is complete, assume your application is complete.",

Having to enter a six digit number keeps Brightspace and BUBrain from going down when someone steals your credentials. It\u2019s the price we pay.\n\nNow, if it really bugs you, go buy a FIDO token, and schedule an appointment with ITS to have it provisioned for Bing2FA. Then you never have to enter another TOTP code.",

I\u2019m here to tell you that if I or another red team member wanted to, we could eventually steal your credentials.\n\nIt\u2019s not an question of stupidity or incompetence anymore, it\u2019s a question of how much effort versus how much reward. Universities are a high reward target. The best anyone can do anymore is make yourself a harder target than the next high reward institution and have a good recovery plan. So again, sorry it takes you an extra five or so seconds to log in, but that\u2019s the price of business nowadays.",

But at least it's better than people being locked out of their accounts (even if the attack of Fall 2020 was most likely an insider threat by a disgruntled IT employee since the attacker had \"an intimate knowledge of the system\") \n\nThe best you can realistically do is to not use Google Authenticator and instead use Twilio Authy which synchronizes your tokens across your devices",

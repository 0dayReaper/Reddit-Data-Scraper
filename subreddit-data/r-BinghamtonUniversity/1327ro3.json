Some will hire you as software engineer-1 with any masters (including some non-STEM degrees) plus specific job experience coding, and software engineer-2 if your masters degree is software adjacent (which would include IS). \n\nOthers won\u2019t hire you at all unless it specifically says \u201ccomputer science\u201d and you have a specific concentration within CS on your transcript. One of the laboratories I\u2019ve worked for was like that. When they said \u201cCS plus concentration in math for cryptographic systems\u201d, they meant it. An IS degree wouldn\u2019t have cut it.",

    "postText": "The year is 2050. The university is groaning under the weight of the 50,000 student population. Harvey Stegner (age 92) announces that the library will be demolished to construct a 20 story parking garage. Renovations on the Engineering Building are not done yet. All dining halls are under construction simultaneously. The only food source is a single vending machine in the basement of Science 1. The only printer on campus just ran out of toner. The Tully\u2019s Lady comes out of retirement and stages a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to overthrow President Stegner and establish Tenders For All (T4A).",

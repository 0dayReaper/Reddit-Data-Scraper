GSOCS doesn\u2019t have a Discord/Facebook/anything else. We used to before COVID, but since COVID the organization officers have failed pretty badly. A lot of the things we used to do like social events, grab and go breakfast during exam weeks, weekly lectures with lunch provided\u2026 all that ended, to say nothing of a Facebook/Slack/Discord group. Turns out most of the people running for GSOCS offices recently have just wanted a resume bullet, not to do any of the organizing work.\n\nInstead, CS grad students have Balkanized into a dozen or so groups based on race/ethnicity, where they are renting, which section of a core course they\u2019re in, etc. You\u2019ll probably be invited to one once you arrive and meet other like-minded students. It\u2019s sad IMO, but I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to help fix it either.",

    "postText": "Binghamton says that the windows software is required for certain programs to run. A MacBook could be used, however a virtual machine would also need to be used on the macbook to work. Does anyone have any advice on how important a MacBook really is for the SOM, and if a windows computer really is required and there is no way around it, how difficult is it to use a virtual machine instead? Thanks in advance.",

That's because typical laptops and pc chips run on an arcitechture called x86. The old macbooks (pre M1) run Intel so emulating windows isn't hard. Now the new macbooks( m1 m2 etc) are using a different architecture( ARM). What this means is you cannot emulate the normal version of windows on that type of MacBook. You can only emulate something called windows on ARM (This is NOT the same as regular windows 10 for example). And windows on ARM sucks (mainly because app compatibility issues and Microsoft sucks at supporting it).  \nSo TLDR: Emulating windows on ARM based MacBook sucks because they can't run the typical windows. No problem at all using VM for  MacBooks before m1.",

            "comment": "They're only saying that because CQS 111 and CQS 311 which cover Microsoft Office 365 applications like excel will be teaching and testing using the Windows version of these programs. The Windows version has more features and a different user interface compared to the MacOS, mobile and web versions. More though, they just don't want to stop class demos trying to juggle so many different versions of the software. The textbook software also teaches based on the windows UI.\n\nIf you take any higher level MIS courses or other electives, those courses too could require software that needs Windows.\n\nThe university has some virtual desktops you can use where you just run the program on your computer. Download, sign in with your PODS ID and you're in. [https://www.binghamton.edu/its/helpdesk/bingview.html](https://www.binghamton.edu/its/helpdesk/bingview.html). Using them on a non-intel based Mac will be more annoying though. If you have a Mac, just run the virtual desktop now and see how it runs.\n\nOtherwise, you can just use a PODS desktop in the library or computer lab for those assignments.",

Macs have a program called Boot Camp that splits your hard drive between MacOS and Windows. \n\nThe setup is fairly straightforward and there are videos on YouTube that show you how to do it.\n\nI had to do it to run a very specific program for school and it works great.",

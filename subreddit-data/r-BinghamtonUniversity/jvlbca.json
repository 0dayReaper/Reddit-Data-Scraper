This hasn't happened to me, but I know my friends have had to buy their prof's books, and they weren't forgiving if students couldn't afford it. It's also an ego thing - making their book the only/primary reading for the class creates a heavily biased learning environment, imo. I think it's beneficial to read from a variety of sources and authors. I enjoy reading academic articles my profs have written, but I'd be frustrated if those were the *only* things we read.",

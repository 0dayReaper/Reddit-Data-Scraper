            "comment": "Hi OP, I work with advising.\n\nIncoming students (at least for Harpur) now register for classes *after* attending orientation, through a 1:1 Zoom appointment with an advisor.  It is expected that students do their best to attend orientation as it helps with info and onboarding things. You cannot register for courses by yourself, you must meet with an advisor to do so. \n\nIf you can't attend orientation, you may have to register for courses later on (not sure how late), but IMO I would first email your advising office and explain your circumstances and see what they would recommend. \n\nThere's a lot of outdated info on here that is more than likely not applicable to you as some people transferred in here pre-Covid and our incoming student registration process changed because of the pandemic.",

The answer was they unfortunately don\u2019t have the resources\u2026 They also clarified that although sign-in starts very early, the orientation itself doesn\u2019t start until around 11AM, so there\u2019s time to drive up from NYC and to leave at a reasonable hour instead of an ungodly early hour. \n\nIn any case, I\u2019ll drive up the day before and my son will stay with me at an Airbnb.",

Unfortunately it does start in the early morning, so you might have to go up the night before, but I think they might have sleeping accommodations for you.",

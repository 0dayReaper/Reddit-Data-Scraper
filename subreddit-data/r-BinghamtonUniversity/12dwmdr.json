Stonybrook, from what I gather, doesn't have too much of a social/weekend environment because most students commute to and from school. Bing, on the other hand, as a much more social environment, especially with it's parties. \\*perspective of a bing student",

It is stronger in a lot of stem subjects and if you live in the area, you can save a lot of money by commuting. But if you want a more residential college experience with more of a campus social life you may be better off going with Binghamton. Binghamton is also stronger in the humanities/liberal arts than stony brook.",

Yup, there should definitely be some rooms saved for transfers and freshmen; when I did it, there were still some rooms in the apartment communities which literally were all gone after a day during our returning students housing time last week.   \n\n\nBesides housing there's orientation obviously for transfers and some events during the first few days after moving in to meet new people.  \n\n\nI personally really like Bing compared to UB. I prefer the smaller campus, where you can walk to basically everything, compared to UB's north and south campus. The buses are more frequent and better in my experience so far as well. As for business/SOM classes, I can notice a difference in difficulty where UB was far too easy and, again, preferred Bing. Just my two cents sorry for the long ass text",

There are shifts all 7 days of the weeks and sometimes your supervisor will contact you and see if you\u2019re available in case someone suddenly calls off. There will also be cases where full-time/part-time workers won\u2019t fill up their slots so more is designated for PRNs. It\u2019s also mandatory to work on select holidays (e.g Christmas) but if you\u2019re a festive kinda guy then you can ask others to swap with ya.",

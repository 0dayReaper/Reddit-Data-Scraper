    "postText": "I was accepted into the SOM, but my first choice was for harpur. My top choice was to major in biological sciences and I wanted to have a minor in business administration but I was accepted to som. i told my counselor and she said if i really wanted to she would help me switch from som to harpur but that i should research som first. i have realized how incredibly lucky i am and that the som is great but business administration isn\u2019t exactly my dream. that\u2019s why i was asking could i double major in both and how would it work? Or is there a way i could major in biological sciences and have a minor in business. sorry for so many questions, i\u2019m also going to say all this to my counselor tomorrow.",

            "comment": "Not that the other posters on this thread are wrong but as someone who works in advising, there's some very important information missing. \n\nThere is no business administration minor. There is a biology minor however, and if you're in SOM, you can still have a minor in Harpur. You can also have two majors with one major in SOM and one in Harpur, HOWEVER, this not called a double major but rather a \"dual degree,\" because it is majoring across two schools. \n\nFor a dual degree, you need to complete both major requirements, both schools' requirements, and instead of needing 126 total credits to graduate, it jumps up to 156 credits. This may take longer than 4 years, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf you want to do anything in business, DO NOT TRANSFER OUT OF SOM. There is technically a transfer process called IUT, but it is very difficult to get into SOM if you're a Harpur student, even if you originally got admitted.\n\nIf you don't want to do business, I would recommend either a BIOL major and ECON minor (if you'd be interested in Economics) or even a double major in both as they are both in Harpur. \n\nWhoever you meet with is going to go over this in more detail with you, but this is my experience based on meeting with hundreds of students. Good luck OP!",

            "comment": "Congratulations on your acceptance! \n\nYou can definitely major in something, say bio, and then minor in business or whatever else you'd be willing to minor in. They don't really care as long as there is a minor for the area you are looking to minor in. I would suggest checking out the website for Bing to see what minors they offer\n\nAlso, double major should be fine. They'll just add it to your degree progress and you'll take classes relevant to the majors\n\nFeel free to ask any other questions",

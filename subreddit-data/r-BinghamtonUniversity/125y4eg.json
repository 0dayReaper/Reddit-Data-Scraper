    "postText": "Should I major in Engineering Chemistry at SBU with a minor in CS, or major in Business Analytics at Binghamton with a minor in chemistry? Or should I flip it?  In fact, is there a different major from the School of Management that I should major in instead? I already got accepted for business analytics but I believe I'm able to switch. I'm not entirely sure of where I want to end up but science-tech/research-tech/chem-tech would be nice. I also do like the beauty product development sector but it's not set in stone. Which school might offer better research opportunity and connections here?",

            "comment": "I'm currently a freshman at Bing majoring in Biochemistry, but I have plans to change it to major in Chem and trying to minor in CS too. A cs minor DOES exist but it is difficult to get involved in it. Mostly because there are many people who register for the courses, so there's usually a waitlist. Since I don't have that much background, I'm taking CS 110 over the summer to go into the cs courses I need for the minor. I know some people who've tried minoring in cs too. \n\nHere's some information about it here: \n\n[https://www.binghamton.edu/computer-science/undergraduate-programs/cs-minor.html#:\\~:text=To%20be%20eligible%20for%20a,\\*%3A%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Programming](https://www.binghamton.edu/computer-science/undergraduate-programs/cs-minor.html#:~:text=To%20be%20eligible%20for%20a,*%3A%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Programming)   \n\n\nI would say that Engineering Chemistry is more promising than just Chem in terms of opportunities and such. They don't have that in Bing but in other types of Engineering. And in terms of schools in Bing, transferring from SOM or Watson to Harpur isn't that hard I believe, but the same can't be said for the opposite.",

                            "comment": "Academically, I would go do chemical engineering at stony brook. I did actually apply to Stony Brook but got waitlisted, and I think the main reason for that is because Stony was the only application I set my major as Biomedical Engineering. Every other was biochem. I realized that engineering would be like its own application to the program and is much harder to get into. In high school I had a strong science/math background, but not really in engineering or comp sci. But anything with \"engineering\" often does help you in having more opportunities. An engineering degree is usually one of the \"top\" degrees. I will say though I heard Stony is like a commuter school and the student life is very dry. I know stony kids that visit Bing to have fun. Both SUNYs are research universities, but I heard Stony holds a good reputation for its academics.   \n\n\nIn terms of what you want to do in the future, a chemistry major is definitely not easy. If you want to do science-tech/research-tech/chem-tech, I would see a chemistry degree being better suited for that. You could find a way to incorporate business analytics with science? If you really see yourself being involved in research or industry, then doing a chem major with a minor in business would make more sense? Business analytics is a good major though and can help you as well. It depends on what you want to do, which for many students, changes alot.",

That is why my only choice is Engineering Chemistry, which is like an advanced version of chemistry- i like to call it \"Chemistry Plus.\" So I wouldn't be doing chemical engineering (much more difficult) but rather something called Engineering Chemistry",

Oneida is one of if not the worse dorm on the entire campus because it's poorly located, much worse for wear, and like the rest of CIW constantly reeks of weed (they call in Stoners in the Woods for a reason).\n\nIf you want actual advice on where to live, choose Dickinson or Mountainview (assuming you don't mind walking up the hill)",

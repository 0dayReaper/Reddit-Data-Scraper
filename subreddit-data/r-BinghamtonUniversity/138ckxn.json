            "comment": "Hi. My name is Lamar I am a current senior at Binghamton University graduating this weekend. I know housing can be hard especially as in coming student with not much experience, and especially considering that living on campus can be very restricted. I used to live in the hillside community it now live downtown which is home to all nightlife in bing. I am currently looking fir someone to take over my lease for the fall 23\u2019- spring 24\u2019 school year for a two bedroom apartment. All amenities included, two on site fitness gyms, 15 mins away from campus, right across from the free campus shuttle, and the university downtown center which is CCPA, and overall is a great opportunity. Base rent is 1,200 however, you have the option of changing the lease to a 4 bedroom if you want more of a social experience. In each apartment you have your own bedroom, bathroom, and only common areas are shared; additionally it\u2019s more affordable. This will be a really good opportunity especially as a new comer Please let me know if you want more information or shoot me a text at 3476388476. Please take time to get back to me on this.",

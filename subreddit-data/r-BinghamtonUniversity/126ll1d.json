There\u2019s a bunch of small four day weekend breaks in which you could go home if you want,and just drive home. I\u2019d say do it, as it\u2019s pretty convenient.",

As someone said, there are a lot of 4-5 day weekends in the fall sem and if you don\u2019t have a car it might not be worth it to be brought back and forth (whether it be by bus or parents). Also, imo there\u2019s not much to do in Bing other than get food and go out to bars, so it would be nice to have a car to go places that are like 20 mins to 1 hour away just for something to do (for instance, you could go up to Syracuse or Ithaca for a day)",

Me And my friends used the buses, and some of my roommates still use them even though we all have cars. Honestly parking is a pain in the neck, and when there\u2019s only a few lots that are overnight resident lots. It definitely has its benefits when it comes to going home, but honestly I didn\u2019t find myself going home for the short 3-4 day weekends. It really depends on what your own preferences are.",

I\u2019ll probably garage the car and give the keys to a family member so they can drive it and it gets some use.\n\nSo I assume I\u2019d be in the transfer building for dorming. They don\u2019t have a designated spot for everyone in the building?",

There\u2019s like a few commuter lots, I know there\u2019s a map, but the only people who get designated parking spots are RDs and other residential people. It\u2019s a free for all, parking is horrendous. Most parking lots that are close to the dorms are commuter, the ones that are residential are typically in more obscure places.",

            "comment": "In my opinion, ODEs for engineers was much easier than Calc 3. While Calc 3 continues your calculus sequence, there are a lot of new concepts such as partial derivatives and triple integrals. On the other hand, ODEs uses what you've already learned in Calc1 and is a very technique-centered course.  \n\nThat being said, the difficulty of a course is subjective and depends on your math strengths and weaknesses, as well as what you want to get from the course. Good luck with your decision!",

My second semester was way more manageable (a strategic choice) and I adjusted to college life/worked hard and got my only ever 4.0.\n\nSubsequent semesters I kept employing study strategies that I learned work for me. I feel like most semesters I\u2019d end up with like one B+ or a couple of A-\u2018s. \n\nI was a psychology major and am now in a clinical PhD program. Sure, there were a few easy classes and psych is not as crazy of a major as the hard sciences, but a lot of the upper level neuro and neuro-adjacent classes were tough. Going to office hours and submitting assignments on time are huge variables that will give professors soft spots if you\u2019re hovering between grades. \n\nI adjunct part time, and I can assure you that last sentence is true for me when I\u2019m determining final grades.",

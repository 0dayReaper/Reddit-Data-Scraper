    "postText": "So I've been admitted to Spring 2024 and waitlisted for fall 2023, I've already sent in a letter of continued interest and they've gotten back to me saying I've been put on a continued interest waitlist but asked to try to secure a fall admission at another college. I was hoping to feel a little more confident about being transferred in to fall but I dont have the confidence. Is there anything else I can do to have a higher chance of getting transferred to fall besides waiting. Obviously it isn't May yet as of this post so deposit deadline hasn't been crossed but I'd still like some more information regarding this.",

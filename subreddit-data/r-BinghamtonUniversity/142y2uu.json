Apartments are on campus which means you have the option to walk but the spaces are smaller and you share the bathroom with the people you live with.",

A close friend who was a transfer got a bunch of emails in the beginning of the semester about transfer events to meet people. Keep your eye open for B-line emails which will probably list transfer events also B-engaged.",

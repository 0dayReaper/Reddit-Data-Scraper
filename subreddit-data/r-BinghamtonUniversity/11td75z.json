    "postText": "I took my Chem test and studied. I was moving way too slow. And I made a huge mistake. I didn\u2019t fill out my scantron as I went. And so I left 6 questions blank on the scantron. I\u2019m so pissed because I studied so much for this test and I felt as though it went well too. Idk I\u2019m just depressed at this point. I\u2019m angry at myself. I know I can\u2019t do anything about it.  Idk I was wondering if something like that happened to anyone.",

So they had the first question in question 1\u2019s spot but somehow missed question 2 and bubbled it into question 3 instead. So the rest of the questions were all off by 1. Keep your head up.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm pretty set on applying to transfer to Bing as a Computer Science Major, Im about to finish my second semester at a SUNY college with a 3.5 GPA, and I've gotten All A's in my math and comp-sci related courses but a C- in a Graphic design class which is weighing down my GPA. Would their grades give me a good shot at getting in? (Also I've completed all my gen eds so idk if that would be good)\n\nI saw how Bing doesn't take transfers for comp sci during the spring semester so I am split on transferring as undecided for the spring of 2024 or transferring for comp sci fall of 2024, the reason I would do the first is that they don't offer many computer science related courses at my current school and I'm not sure what classes I could take that would be transferred to the comp sci degree. \n\n  \nIf anyone has any information that would help I would greatly appreciate it.",

            "comment": "Did you mean Fall of 2023, and Spring of 2024? \n\nThis is mentioned on the sub a lot, but it is very difficult to get into Binghamton's CS program if you are not originally admitted into it. Binghamton has a few \"schools\" within it, and each have their own majors. Most are \"professional\" schools, so things like School of Management for Accounting/Business, Decker for Nursing, and Watson for Engineering/Computer Science. The majority (if not all) of students who transfer in undecided go into Harpur, the largest school, which happens to house the liberal arts and humanities majors.\n\nIf you do not get accepted into Watson, you will most likely be placed in Harpur. I believe this is also the case for applying undecided, as I'm 99% sure that to apply for one of professional schools, you must specifically choose the major in the school you're applying to (I could be wrong on this).\n\nHowever, in either case, if you're trying to go from Harpur into Watson for CS, you will have to undergo a formal application process called an \"intra university transfer\" (IUT) where you apply to transfer into Watson. \n\nIt is extremely competitive, if not impossible to IUT - they let three IUT students in annually. Meaning, it is highly, highly recommended you apply for CS initially rather than apply undecided and then attempt to transfer, because you don't want to risk coming here and not being able to get into CS, as you really need to be a formally declared CS major to take the majority of CS courses here.",

            "comment": "you definitely have a good shot of getting in. your grades in math/cs related classes are considered far more than a graphic design class so dont worry about that too much. if you are set on cs then i would not transfer in as undecided. it is far less likely for you to be able to get into the cs program if you are already at bing as an undecided major\u2014 your chances are much higher if you apply directly to the cs program in the fall.\n\nmake sure you dont take classes other than cs/math/gen ed classes that you can transfer to bing. i did that cause i didnt check which of my classes would transfer and i basically wasted two semesters taking useless classes. im not sure what you would do for a year at your school if youre already done with your math, gen eds, etc so i would come up with a backup plan like considering stony or buffalo which have comparable cs programs and maybe even a cuny like queens college which has a decent program as well. you can also consider bings computer engineering program which should be less competitive to get into (still not easy though) if you transfer as undecided and dont get into cs. \n\nhere are some resources: you can speak to someone about transferring via the contact info at the bottom of [this](https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/index.html) page. you can also check [here](https://www.binghamton.edu/computer-science/pdf/2022_bscs_requirements.pdf) for the bing cs course requirements, [here](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/student-services/advising/undergraduate.html) for the gen ed requirements, and [here](https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/coursework.html) to see which of your credits transfer. i dont think it shows cs classes and it is also not completely accurate. bing typically doesnt allow most cs course credits to transfer from other schools anyways but maybe you can take some more of bings required math classes, gen eds, science sequence, etc. you will do a transfer credit evaluation with someone when you actually transfer in\n\ngood luck!",

Thank you for writing all this it really does help a lot!\n\nI\u2019ll focus on apply directly to cs and take as many math and gen courses while I\u2019m still at my current school\n\nMy only other question would be, if bing doesn\u2019t take any of my cs credits, should I not bother with the classes like comp sci 2 and data structures and algorithms, and just focus on finishing the classes like calc 2, discrete maths and the Chem track?",

Assuming you are still considering that option, you should apply as early as possible in the cycle. CS fills up very quickly, especially for transfers.  It is also an extraordinarily competitive program",

    "postText": "Im currently applying for Watson fall 2023 as a CS major, they asked me for a course progress report around and I've submitted it around 2 weeks ago. When should I expect to receive a decision and has anybody gotten in Watson yet?   \n\n\nFor reference, Im a freshmen at another SUNY and  have a 3.7 GPA after one semester, will satisfy all pre reqs before attending Bing in the fall if i do get in. Mid year reports are All As.",

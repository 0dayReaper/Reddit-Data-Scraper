    "postText": "Is anyone interested in vermicomposting? It's a great way to compost in small spaces, like apartments or dorms that are low maintenance and don't smell.\n\nMy worm bin (5gal Lowe's bucket) is overcrowded and I'm looking to unload some of my guys before I move to lighten the load.\n\nIf anyone is interested in starting a vermicompost bin for their dorm/apartment, PM me and I can give you some healthy worms to start! \n\nI would ask for $5 - $10 for a starter for them, just because it's difficult to separate them from their castings to relocate.\n\n**Also, if anyone is looking for some incredibly nutritious soil for their houseplants, PM me! I'm trying to reduce the volume of castings in my bin and I don't have any house plants right now. The castings are some of the best soil/ compost you can get for houseplants , and I've found they really help reduce plant pathogens/ boost health when mixed / replanted with soil.",

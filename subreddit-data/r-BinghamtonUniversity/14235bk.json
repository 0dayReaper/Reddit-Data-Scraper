By far one of the most serious things Binghamton needs to fix. Sodexo is horrible workers are high on the job, lettuce is bad, chicken undercooked, speed at which food goes out extremely slow. Binghamton really needs to start transitioning away from Sodexo. It\u2019s very frustrating and led to me cooking for myself in the following years.",

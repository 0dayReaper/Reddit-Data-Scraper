    "postText": "If you entered Binghamton in 2019 or prior please help me out. I have a distinct memory of the SOM writing requirement being one C and one J or one J and three W courses (but only for those who entered Binghamton in 2019 or prior). Am I going crazy? I can only find the C or J rule written out now and can\u2019t find anywhere where it says three Ws can count as a C. However I distinctly remember that being specified in the slide deck they provided when I transferred from Harper to SOM in 2020. I tried to look back at the slide deck but they have since updated it, now there isn\u2019t even a slide for writing requirements. \n\nCan anyone confirm if this is actually a rule and if so where I can find it written down. I would go to SOM advising but I remember when I first saw the rule and asked about it a few years ago one person told me yes I can take three Ws and it will count for a C and another person told me no and then someone else told me yes again\u2026basically I don\u2019t trust SOM advising to give me accurate information.",

The C requirement is University wide.   \n\nAny such requirements would be detailed in the Bulletin; older issues can be found here https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2022-23/archives.html",

Either they have different requirements for those who transfer from Harper to SOM than those who started in SOM or I\u2019m just misremembering. But I remember this so clearly though since people kept giving me different answers at the time and I went to advising multiple times over it\u2026definitely confused rn",

BUT if you take 1 class that gives you a C for a letter grade, then you can combine two W\u2019s together to make a C. It is only an SOM rule and it is pretty hidden, but advising always makes the exception",

I used to have it in my email but I cleared out my old emails a while ago and forgot to save it. I want to have it somewhere in writing since I find that SOM advising can be finicky, some people would know of this rule but some may not. \n\nAlso side not I know I said three Ws in my original post but yeah it\u2019s probably two Ws. Couldn\u2019t remember if it was three or two so thanks for clearing that up :)",

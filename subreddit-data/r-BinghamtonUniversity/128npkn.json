I already didnt meet the requirements with a gpa of 3.0 and not having calculus done. \n\nBut i thought my participation in unibuddy (which was pretty well hidden), attendance of transfer tuesday, private meeting with a counselor, along with providing additional information about me would have helped.

Check your status page if they gave you a date yet.  \n\nI was accepted conditionally via the BAP program, where you live in Binghamton dorms, but take classes at Broome college and they let you transfer after a year if you have a 3.0 or better.  I had a 94 average in NYC public schools, so maybe they hated I didn\u2019t submit my SATs?\n\nBAP seems ok if you are really set on Binghamton.   For me,Binghamton doesn\u2019t offer an architecture degree outside of their art history department, so I always preferred the BS Architecture offerred by University of Buffalo, who accepted me in December, so only accepting me into the BAP program was the deciding action that made it certain I wouldn\u2019t go to Binghamton.  \n\nGood Luck.",

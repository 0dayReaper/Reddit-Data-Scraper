Baruch is a solid choice as well but there is one downside in that I think you have to jump through some prereq hoops before they let you officially declare an accounting major. In binghamton you won't have to deal with that. Bing is also a smaller program which I think is a plus.",

You should think more about other factors like cost, location, dorming vs living at home, etc. I personally decided to go to a suny instead of a cuny because I wanted more of a college experience cause there isnt as much socializing at cunys imo. however I am now unsure if I made a wise decision cause of the cost difference\n\ngood luck!",

I had to leave my hometown because there were too many people not doing anything with their lives, and very willing to pull me towards their shenanigans. Some people prefer to stay at home to be close to family. Going to SUNY or CUNY, you aren't breaking the bank like a private, so go where you think you will do the best academically and everything will work out. And if it doesn't work out, transfer.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people concerned over the differences of buildings within a community. Really the only buildings that deviate from the rest at anything more than a slight layout difference are Mohawk, Oneida, Old Digman, and Cleveland. Besides those the biggest difference between the buildings is their physical location. My personal opinion is incoming freshmen don\u2019t need to stress too much about the specific building spend your time getting to know your roommates and deciding on the community.  Feel free to disagree though this is just my opinion.",

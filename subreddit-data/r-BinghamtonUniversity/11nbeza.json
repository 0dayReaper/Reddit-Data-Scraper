Homework was manageable, he is very flexible with homework, if you miss a deadline just ask for an extension and he will just give it to you. Midterm and final are fair, he does a lot of reviews for exams, the lectures are engaging and he actually knows his material.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve taken both and I\u2019d say calc 2 but if you are better with Orgo and bad with math do lab. My tales are:\n\nCalc 2 is very manageable if you have enough time to dedicate to it and if you\u2019re good with calc. If you took calc 1 recently and are able to get a good professor you\u2019ll do fine (I recommend Kaz or Biddle). Calc is mostly memorizing what to do in what situation. 227 especially was just figure out what rules/series applies. \n\nOrgo lab does not have very hard material especially if you have a good foundation with orgo. The workload and Professor make that class difficult. It\u2019s mostly lots of writing reports and lab stuff and the labs are group based. The reports are individual and so if you can handle the writing it\u2019s just time wasting. The only annoying thing is frequent quizzes (not hard but you will have to review often). I hated my 8am lab bc I\u2019m not an early riser.",

Me personally, I thought calc was fine but I also don\u2019t really mind calculus so I guess depends on how confident you are in math. Secondary plus is if I\u2019m not mistaken if you do bad in 226 or 227 they\u2019re half semester courses so you don\u2019t have to wait till the end of the semester and half to take the whole session again some people do 226 twice in one semester if they need to I hope this helped at all",

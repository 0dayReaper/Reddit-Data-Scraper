The exams were almost exactly what we went through in lecture, and really not any harder than anything in Cracking the Code Interview. The workload was reasonable\n\n373 with Garrison on the other hand? A nightmare. Incredibly tedious JFLAP projects, a weekly homework, quizzes, and exams from hell. Worst class I ever took, and it took me multiple attempts to pass it.",

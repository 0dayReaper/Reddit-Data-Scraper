You don't receive your actual diploma on graduation day, only the case, and then the diploma arrives to you by mail 6-8 weeks later, and that will have your final distinction printed on it.",

If you fall out of a certain gpa distinction range but stand for it anyway, nothing's gonna happen. Distinction might be printed in the program as well. Hopefully your prof. will have  quick turnaround with the grade.",

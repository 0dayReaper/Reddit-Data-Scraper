    "postText": "hi, i cannot sleep and i am very bored and i remembered this was around the same time last year that i was accepted into bap (binghamton advantage program). so i decided to come up with this completely honest, and unasked for review to help those of you who are deciding on attending :) this is going to be targeted at the bap program and i may talk about the school in general in certain topics but do not expect a review of binghamton in general. i am going to stay mostly anonymous and i have no intentions of becoming a bap mentor ever so this is the most real it is going to get from me. i understand not everyone wants a book as a review, ***so i will be keynoting important parts at the bottom.*** but if you are anything like me, feel free to read this entire thing so you can truly get an understanding of bap before you commit. lastly, this is all from MY perspective and other people may have seen or experienced things in different ways.\n\nCost:\n\ni was under the original impression that it would be way cheaper since we technically will be getting our education at a community college and not binghamton, and on paper, the tuition of suny broome is way cheaper. however, something that was definitely mentioned in the agreement that i simply did not read was a $3-4k \"bap fee\" with joining the program, so it basically levels out the cost difference and it is the exact same cost as regularly paying for binghamton. obviously financial aid/scholarships also play a role but the fee is not covered by federal financial aid. (i was fortunate enough to get my tuition covered but the bap fee and housing were paid out of pocket \\~ 8k a semester/16k a year). as a bap student you are automatically assigned a smaller meal plan which is about $300 less a semester; i am a hungrier person so i upgraded to the regular meal plan but i know many others who didn't. additionally, each different housing community is a different cost (only about 1k in range though) all being said, this isn't a cheaper option by any means and you will be paying about the same as every other binghamton student for your first year.\n\nBroome Life:\n\nin comparison to binghamton, the broome campus is a little different. it is way smaller and the buildings are very close together which makes it easy to go from class to class. the facilities aren't as nice as binghamton, but i wouldn't say it's an ugly school by any means. the dining hall is NOTHING like binghamton's and the food is extremely overpriced. many students eat their meals before and after class to avoid eating at broome. i have occasionally bought a drink or a small snack at the dining hall, but an order of chicken tenders and french fries can cost $7, so i usually just eat when i return to binghamton campus. \n\nobviously as a community college, it does not hold the same rigor as binghamton does, however the classes are not like high school and some can be pretty challenging. i am a stem major and i had to take 2 science classes as well as 3 other ones in my first semester to fill my general degree requirement (remember you need 30 credits for the entire year to go over to binghamton after one year) i will admit my 3 other classes were very manageable, and i rarely struggled; the same could not be said about my science classes. they weren't impossible and i had good professors, but the material was a little difficult and i was challenged. \n\non the topic of classes, transportation is obviously one of the biggest topics about bap. obviously since you are taking classes at broome not binghamton, you have to commute to broome very regularly. the schedule is very accurate and buses always wait until the expected times. that being said there 2 buses that come at the same time, only once per hour; the local number 9, and the express number 9. the local 9 stops at uclub and a few places downtown and is a 20 minute ride. the express 9 goes straight from binghamton to broome and is a 10 minute ride. both are perfectly fine since most classes start at the beginning of the hour so you will definitely make it to your class with either bus. that said, them both coming at the same time becomes a problem if you miss them, and your only other option is a $15-20 uber. the buses sometimes get cancelled and there is an alternative way that involves two other buses and is an hour long ride. this can be really annoying and i've had to uber before or miss class but if you stay on time and check emails regularly you should be fine.(although there has been times where the 9 buses were cancelled and hour before my class...)\n\nalso yes, bap students can bring their car. do not do it, only like 5 kids in my year did (theres like 120 of us) and i've been told they barely use it since everyone takes the bus at binghamton anyways since the bus pass is included in your binghamton i.d.\n\ncampus life at broome from bap students is almost unheard of. the mentors will make it seem like a lot of students do programs at broome, but they don't. i have seen a few people do them but a large majority of bap kids will do clubs and activities at binghamton (like me). this does not include academic and counseling services which is something you definitely should take advantage of(no pun intended). i don't know anyone who has anything against the broome students, but if we're being honest, we did this program to be involved in binghamton, not broome. with that, many bap students will make friends with each other and binghamton students, but not many of us are friends with broome students. we are polite and i along with friends have had conversations with broome students since they are in all of our classes. don't let this discourage you from befriending a broome student since everyone wants friends, but they just aren't who the bap students predominately befriend and talk to. however, like mentioned, we did this for binghamton and not really for broome, so many of us just focus on binghamton. \n\nAdvising:\n\nupon getting into bap, you will be automatically assigned an advisor. in my year there are two academic advisors, and the director micheal who is very nice and supportive. i've heard mixed opinions about the two academic advisors but i enjoyed mine and she helped me work out my schedule. that is one great thing, bap students get the luxury of pretty much all of the advisors and micheal hold your hand with anything you may need and they are very communicative and always willing to meet in person. i personally don't speak to mine often because i have a pretty straight forward plan, but i know a few people who talk with them regularly.\n\nBeing BAP at Binghamton:\n\ni was very open about me being in bap to my friends at binghamton. some did not know what the program was, and some have heard about it from other people they have met. most did not care and the ones who did were just interested on how it worked. the only times i have heard negative remarks about being in bap was when me and my other bap friends joke around about it. that being said, some bap students do not like to tell their binghamton friends that they are in bap, so be weary of that so you don't accidentally \"out\" them.\n\nif you are in bap, it is recommended that you live in newing, dickinson or college in the woods since the bus stop for the number 9 buses are in front of rafuse hall (dickinson community). i personally lived in the newing community and my commute to the bus stop was a less than 5 minute walk, but if you live in mountainview or hinman it can easily turn into a 15-20 minute walk. \n\nwith living at binghamton, you are allowed to participate in any campus activities and clubs, and your binghamton i.d. will allow you to tap in to all campus events. extracurriculars and clubs are definitely something to find more about independently, but its a great way to meet people and branch out. however, you are not allowed to join any professional sports teams, but co-rec (living community sports teams) and club sports are great options. another thing you are not allowed to participate in is greek life. personally, i surrounded myself with people who plan on doing greek life and they were pretty bummed out about it, but many students obviously do not really care since they had no intentions of rushing. however, some students who plan on doing greek life join the sorority/fraternity secretly, or they have a pretty established connection with the organization they plan on joining. overall, you will have a very similar campus life at binghamton to other students, and i recommend that you participate in binghamton campus life since this is what you're coming for.\n\ni did mention earlier how you are not allowed to join greek life as a bap student, but that does not mean you aren't allowed to go to their parties. invitations for frat parties get slid under your door every weekend, and many bap students attend parties and the downtown scene in general. obviously going out and drinking is a personal preference, but the options are definitely there and when you're downtown no one knows you're in bap so have fun and meet new people. \n\nBreaks:\n\nif you do plan on doing bap one thing you should really pay attention to is the difference between the binghamton and broome calendar, because they do not line up. first of all, we started classes this year a whole week after the binghamton kids did. also throughout the year when binghamton has little 4 day breaks, broome usually does not get those and you still have class. also, sometimes broome will have a random day or week off that does not match with binghamton's. i always went home in those instances but some will stay for the friday/saturday just to go out at night. for instance, broome wrapped up our spring break last week, but the binghamton kids start theirs a week after so we will be here for a whole week going to class while the binghamton kids are home. \n\nwhen binghamton does close for break, bap students are allowed to stay for free for however long they need to. like mentioned, there will be days where binghamton students leave for the whole week but you will have class. campus runs at a much slower rate and feels very deserted at times. the dining halls have reduced or no hours (c4 dining hall is your best bet over breaks) and some buses may not be running (number 9 always will). this is why i recommend that you make at least one or two bap friends so that you can still have someone to talk to and hangout with when the binghamton kids go home.\n\nKey Points:\n\n\\-mandatory $3-4k binghamton advantage program fee\n\n\\-cheaper meal plan (meal plan e) at default \n\n\\-okay suny broome campus, expensive dining hall\n\n\\-don't slack off in classes it is still a college and commitment is expected and you want to be able to matriculate properly into binghamton after 1 year \n\n\\-advising is very helpful and bap staff are friendly \n\n\\-number 9 bus is manageable as long as you stay on track, cancellations can be annoying \n\n\\-broome campus life is so-so, binghamton campus life is recommended \n\n\\-some students are open about being in bap, some are not. most binghamton students do not care and will not discriminate\n\n\\-newing, dickinson and ciw are the recommended dorms to live in, but you can live anywhere on campus \n\n\\-nightlife and campus activities are available to bap students\n\n\\-breaks do not line up and you will have to stay on an almost empty campus sometimes \n\noverall, i wouldn't say this is what i intended my freshman year to be like. but i do not regret it. it is a nice program and it is definitely preparing me for my next year at binghamton. there were some cons to the program but that's with everything in life. if you don't see yourself doing this then don't, but honestly, its not bad at all and i only know a handful of people who genuinely don't like to program. it is what you make out of it and it can be a very beneficial first year if you make it one. feel free to ask any questions :)",

                    "comment": "congrats! so i'm actually a freshman so i'm still in bap. so, i have not seen my transcript post-bap, but i'm assuming it will show just broome since you will be enrolled in the school officially because you are getting a broome i.d. and you will get a \"Bee number\" (it gets super confusing since binghamton also uses the term \"B Number\", but do not mix them up) but college transcripts are very brief and minimal so there would be no room to explain what the bap program is, so it's likely we'll just appear as transfer students.\n\nand if your concern is that the appearance of a community college before binghamton will affect your odds of a post-graduate school acceptance, it will not. it shows improvement and it shows that you are a person who works for your goals. there are plenty of very successful people who attended a community college before a 4-year school.",

Not as strong as those given direct admission, but stronger than those waitlisted for the fall or waitlisted period. So much so that we were given this opportunity. Essentially I think we are applicants that are a step up from those waitlisted that Binghamton wants to ensure they can secure.",

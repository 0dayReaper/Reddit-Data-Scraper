    "postText": "My nephew is graduating HS &amp; going to Binghamton next year. I\u2019m trying to personalize a money clip or something similar that says \u201cBinghamton class of 2027\u201d,  but can\u2019t figure out what students there refer to Binghamton as? I was searching IG and see hashtags with bearcats, bing, or mostly just BinghamtonU. BU on google shows Boston university \n\nCan anyone confirm? Binghamton or BinghamtonU seems too long regardless and I really want it to be what students there use when referring to the school. \n\nThanks In advance \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",

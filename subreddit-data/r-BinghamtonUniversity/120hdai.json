Going into my senior year as a computer engineer, but still need to take linear algebra.  \nAny recommendations for professors ?\n\n\nI tried taking the class last semester, but ended up dropping because of the professor... im going to be taking the class in the upcoming fall semester, since I need it from some prerequisites by next spring. \n\n\nThank you!! :)",

I took the class online during covid and got an A, was a lot of work but she provides fill-in-the blank lecture notes for every class and a lot of study material. Lectures were always very organized",

I accepted an on-campus job through my current employer for the Summer term but I have to be put in the system as a temp employee rather than a GA, so I was wondering if I would be able to get another ID card (just need it for OCCT really). \n\nI plan to reach out to the respective office on Monday for an answer (not sure who I'd ask about this but I'm assuming HR?), just wondering if anyone knew here.",

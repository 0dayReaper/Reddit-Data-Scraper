    "postText": "The Spring 2023 semester withdrawal deadline is fast approaching. It falls on this **Thursday, May 4th.**\n\nEDIT: Confirmed dates and times - \n\n**Regular (self) semester withdrawal deadline is May 4th @ 11:59pm**\n\n**Medical semester withdrawal deadline is May 4th @ 4:00pm**\n\nIf you are considering withdrawing from all of your courses this semester, it is *highly* recommended you do so before the deadline passes as I don't believe you can do so afterwards. Keep in mind that the deadline is prior to final exams, so you can't just decide to withdraw if you do poorly on your final.",

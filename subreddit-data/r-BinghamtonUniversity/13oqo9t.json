I\u2019m an econ major, and although I\u2019m not bad at science, I don\u2019t want to take anything I\u2019m going to spend all of my time studying for.\n\nFor context, I don\u2019t mind biology and environmental science, but I really don\u2019t like chemistry, physics, or earth science at all.",

The class is pretty much identical to AP Chem so if you know or took that, that's what this will be like but in 1 semester as opposed to 2. \n\nThe class goes really, really fast. It's extremely easy to fall behind just because of the sheer amount of content that's covered (20 chapters in 16 weeks to be precise). Thus if  you're in the 90% of people that haven't taken chemistry since sophomore year of high school, please please review ahead of time. Or be really willing to study the material, go to office hours, and go to tutoring hosted by University Tutorial Services. It can and will chew you up and spit you out if you let it. Most people if given the choice will take CHEM 107 and 108 since it's much more digestible given you have double the amount of time to learn it. Especially with our chemistry professors not being the best (the same goes with biology and physics too)",

Almost everybody that came to me had fallen behind and had next to no foundational knowledge of Chemistry because of COVID. What made it incredibly frustrating for me was the fact that most people just didn't seem to care about learning the material. I didn't have regular tutees like I did with my Math 324 students (who also were willing and able to put in the work to get up to par). \n\nThey just wanted to know what was needed to pass the next test. I understand that most people in Watson outside of BME like myself will never need to know that much chemistry (especially in a sea of Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer engineers). But it's still an interesting class if you ask me and I'd always try to sprinkle in as much interesting information as I could to try and encourage learning. But I still ended up having to take a heavy-handed approach which my manager didn't like. Which isn't entirely my fault when my tutees just didn't want to work with me.\n\nThe scary part is that it used to be even worse. From a brief talk I and another student managed to have as part of a Scholar's Class with our Nobel Laureate Chemist Dr. M. Stanley Whittingham, we found out that he used to teach CHEM 111 and would skip the first six chapters as \"foundational knowledge\" to go through all 24 chapters of the Ebbing and Gamon book that has since been replaced by Lume Learning (though the slides are the same). Meaning he would start not with a review of sig figs but on Quantum Theory. Given how much people struggle with the first test on stuff such as moles and calories, I can only imagine what the performance of students was like back then. Even with as brilliant of a scientist as he is helping to invent the Lithium-Ion Batteries that make modern life possible",

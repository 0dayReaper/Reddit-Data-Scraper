The final is surprisingly the easiest one but some people still did bad on it, since each exam is worth 15% of ur grade in pretty sure thats 60% of ur grade that can be compromised based on these exams. In a group setting as well, the TCI can mess u up if someone in your group decides for some reason to give u a bad rating for some reason.",

Bing has a ton of resources that you can utilize no matter what type of advice you're looking for, ranging from general advising to major/department advising, to the study abroad office, and more. \n\nWhatever you're looking for, be sure to consult the experts, because sometimes your friends may not know everything, and there have been many changes since a lot of people graduated.",

Course material is  straightforward but he can be disorganized when it comes to errors in his slides/Kahoots/study guides  (which is probably because he's just coming from Broome) but otherwise he's very willing to to explain questions. He tries to keep the class engaged as well, just the other week he had one of his TAs shock him with a shock collar to explain t-tests. Doesn't grade too harshly  just know that your grade is dependent on 4 tests.",

    "postText": "Im a cinema major so I have to take one 400 level Cine course before I graduate. As next year is my senior year Im running out of time to do so.\n\nThe options for this upcoming semester are Advanced Film and Videomaking(pre req is Cine 351 which I still need to take)\nOr\nGodard: Film texts and Context, which sounds boring as hell.\n\nWhy are there only 2 400 level courses? Do I just put it off and hope something better is available next semester? Im planning on taking 351 2nd semester next year so putting both off till then seems like a bad idea. Am I really stuck taking Godard?",

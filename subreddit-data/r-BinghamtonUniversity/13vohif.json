    "postText": "Hello, I'm teaching one of the summer classes that's starting today (HIST 318J) called \"The Columbian Exchange, 1500-1700\" in the BU Brain and am writing this specifically to my students. \n\nAs a lot of you are probably aware Brightspace and most of the other BU websites are currently down. I spoke with a guy at ITS and he said they're working on the problem. A part of the problem is because of the outage I don't have any way of accessing my students' email addresses, so it's difficult for me to start working on a back up plan. If you are enrolled in this class, please let me know and we can talk about what to do. I've got most of the course materials saved here on my computer, so I can potentially send those to you.\n\nThanks!",

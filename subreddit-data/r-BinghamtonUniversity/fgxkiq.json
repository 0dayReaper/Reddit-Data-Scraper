We won't even close until someone with the virus has 5-14 days to spread the virus around campus(assuming he/she gets tested positive as soon as symptoms show, which is not even guaranteed). I would say a couple hundred or more will be infected by then, considering the exponential growth and high r0 on a packed campus. And then we go home in 2 weeks and potentially get our grandparents killed because we would still be in the incubation period. It seems like our administration still doesn't understand the severity of this pandemic.",

I was planning to split the costs with some friends who were just gonna put their fridges (+ misc. stuff) in the storage unit but the email said that \" Sharing a locker with another student or providing another student access to your locker / locker room is expressly prohibited.\" \n\nI'm not planning to give anyone else access to the locker but can't I just put their stuff in it and if someone asks, I can just say it's mine?",

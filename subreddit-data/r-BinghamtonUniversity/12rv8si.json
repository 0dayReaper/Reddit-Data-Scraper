    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m new to this Reddit thing so I\u2019m not sure what to say but I\u2019m a junior in high school and bing is my top choice. There is a certain major track I would like to pursue at bing therefore I\u2019m very interested in the school. I would like to know if I have an okay chance at getting in and if not, how the transfer rate is. \n\nI have a 4.3 weighted GPA, not submitting any test scores (sat or ap), 9 aps by the end of my senior year.\n\necs: nyu law program, 2 year medical program, cancer organization ambassador, gallopnyc volunteer (physical therapy), president of 2 clubs, school news, cac futures and options college prep program, chess team manager, varsity tennis and a few others that are pretty average \n\nmy recommendations are from my ap psych and ap statistics teachers, and my essay is on how music has helped me achieve many things in my life. I feel like submitting aps and sat would help me but i cant get a decently high score so I\u2019m worried. Any advice would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: guys I got a 1 on ap world and lower than a 3 on all if not most of my aps ik submitting test scores would help but I can\u2019t \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

Bing accepts upto 8 AP classes can give them a 4-credit Pass grade, meaning that you will have 32 credits when you come to college. As the graduation credit requirement is around 126, you have a headstart where you can either graduate early (save load of tuition and time) or pursue in multiple studies. A lot of the AP credits can fulfill Gen-Ed classes (which are non-major general education class you have to take), which enables you go take classes you are interested in.",

I do plan on doing dual enrollment to make up for it though, thank you for the advice!",

Some people might choose to do BAP where you take classes at broome cc but live in the binghamton dorms. Costs more money but makes for an easier adjustment.",

However, I know where you\u2019re coming from since Broome classes cost less, so technically it would be cheaper to just do a year at Broome. Difference is you wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed Bing admission after 30 credits and a 3.0 gpa.",

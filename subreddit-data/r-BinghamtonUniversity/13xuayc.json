    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman and is deciding between Mountainview and dickinson. I want to know which of the buildings have larger rooms. For Dickinson, I was wondering what is the design of the rooms for hotel double (do they have the bathroom inside each room for two people or is it outside of the room) and I heard the dining hall is bad for Dickinson (is the food bad). For Mountainview, I was wondering the four-person suites has one bathroom or two bathrooms. Also one question for the Mountainview six person suite, one of the bathroom has the sink outside of the bathroom?",

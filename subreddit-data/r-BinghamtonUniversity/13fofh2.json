    "postText": "My professor sent this email on Wednesday  \u201cwill send all remaining grades by the end of the day tomorrow. Final grades will be posted by the beginning of next week.\u201d\n\nHe never sent me my grades my grades yesterday. He didn\u2019t send any grades until the last few weeks on the semesters so I had no idea how I was doing until then. He is notorious for not answering his emails. Should I be concerned he didn\u2019t send grades yesterday? Is this acceptable to say and not do?? I feel genuinely confused about what\u2019s going on.",

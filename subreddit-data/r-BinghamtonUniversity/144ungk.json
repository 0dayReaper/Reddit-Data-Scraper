            "comment": "Was there freshman year. Very close to the dining hall which is nice. I would always bring some NOWL back to my room to watch a movie with. Every floors garbage room has a place for dining hall things which was great. Also the nature preserve is right behind the building and people always sit on the block by the lake to study and relax. I thought it was a great building the only con is that it\u2019s a little far from classes but still better than walking up the mountain view hill tbh.",

            "comment": "lived there last school year i personally wasn\u2019t a fan of it all, if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s worried about the social aspect of your first year endicott is definitely a social building and you\u2019ll have fun. There\u2019s AC the heat is good not really any astronomical problems like hinman and ciw (showers not working/flooding) so i wouldn\u2019t worry too much. my biggest problem  was i\u2019m not a morning person and waking up for an 8am you better be prepared for that 10-15 minute walk back and forth. My biggest advice to you is make sure your gaps in your schedule are either big or none existent because you don\u2019t want to walk back to your dorm for a 15 min break just to have to leave early for the walk back to class. Other than walking to class its very close to the gym very close to C-4 i am just traumatized from the walk \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Also a big thing was the bathroom i am personally a fan of using the bathroom before i shower but unfortunately they\u2019re separated so running to the bathroom before you shower is so annoying so i recommend you use the communal bathroom it is like a private one with a toilet and a shower. also some people are dirty so get to know the people you\u2019re sharing your bathroom with and set some boundaries i had like actual poop all over my bathroom once i\u2019ve seen throw up trash pilled up used toilet paper people stealing things from the bathroom",

I know of a situation where a student sub leased to another person.  The person is not a student and the other roommates were not made aware of this.  When the complaint was brought to management, they pointed out that this is in the 12 plus page lease.  One possible roommate was a **mother and child.**  It didn't happen but almost did.  BE CAREFUL.  UClub is 100% FALSE ADVERTISING.",

There are decent places and decent landlords on westside and downtown (will need to do bit of research on individual landlords) for a much lower price. The walls are paper thin and you could hear your neighborhoods doing everything (literally EVERYTHING). If safety is your main concern, then yes UCLUB is safer than downtown. Keep in my though, downtown and the west side isn't that bad in terms of safety. Parts of the west side are mostly students anyway, so those areas are pretty safe.",

            "comment": "Hello, I traveled on the 8PM Ourbus from George Washington Bridge to Ithaca NY on April 10th, 2023. I took a red duffle bag with me, but when I went to retrieve my bag it seems as though someone took my bag mistaking it with their own. \n\nThe bus stopped in Binghamton (and Fort Lee, NJ) so I thought I would post this here. I have already contacted Ourbus about the situation. I was told to take the switched bag (the one that wasn't mine) with me and have posted a photo of it above. I looked for any identifying information to set up an exchange but couldn't find any. In the bag itself there are cloths, a toothbrush, and a pair of rollerblades. If this bag is your and you have my bag please reach out to me and we could set up an exchange (given that you can provide proof that you have my bag). Thanks!",

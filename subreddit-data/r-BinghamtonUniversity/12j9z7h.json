    "postText": "Anyone have input on Mariano Arias or have taken any of the following classes? I need an upper level biology next semester and there's few I can take. Which of these are the least painful?  \nBIOL470 (Plant Ecology), BIOL476 (Population Ecology), BIOL475 (Entomology...I hear the exams are terrible but the professor is terrific), or should I just take BIOL401 (Molecular Genetics)?  \nI wanted to take Animal Behavior or Genetics Lab, but they got filled and I pick tomorrow.",

Right now they're working on incoming new and transfer students so they probably just haven't gotten around to you yet. \n\nIf you mean take MATH 224 and 225 during the SAME Summer term, no I don't believe you can do that, since 224 is a prereq for 225. \n\nIf you meant take 224 during Term I (or something similar), and then 225 during Term II, this would most likely work (but Summer registration for Calc can get weird, so you should ask the MATH department for help registering). However, I believe 224 probably started a bit ago so it may be too late to add it. \n\nThere is typically a sheet that shows you all the \"minicourse\" deadlines for the semester, however I don't think Student Records uploaded it for Summer 2023 (the link doesn't work, they might've forgotten). I would maybe reach out to the MATH department to see if it's not too late to add 224, then you can look into 225 if possible.",

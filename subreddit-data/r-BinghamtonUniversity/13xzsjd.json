If I remember right the official parking is only for RD\u2019s but it\u2019s way more convenient for unpacking after big breaks and for UberEats (tho full disclosure, when I was in newing I only ever lived in endicott)",

            "comment": "Broome is awesome - quieter,  nicer facilities imo, big rooms. They have tons of gender neutral/single stalled bathrooms on each floor rather than 2 of public restrooms with 3 stalls and 2 showers if that matters to you. \n\n\nBingham is nice if having as much space as possible is important to you. Otherwise I don't really have anything nice to say about it. The rooms are massive but everything is breaking constantly (there was like 1 operating water fountain in the entire building last year), it's much louder, people steal things. \n\nI haven't lived in Endicott or Delaware but I've heard they have smaller rooms, but as the other person mentioned, a couple hundred feet closer to campus. \n\nPersonally I would go with Broome, but that's just my 2 cents.",

    "postText": "Given recent pop culture events I thought I'd share something that happened a few weeks ago. \n\nI'm a Binghamton University grad student who drives with Uber on the weekends. On a Friday evening, I picked up three guys from University Plaza/UClub headed to a dorm building in Dickinson Community on campus. Turning onto Murray Hill Road, I passed a bunch of people walking out of the Chabad building, likely from Shabbat services. One of the passengers said to his friends, \"Jews ruin everything.\"\n\nI said, \"Excuse me?!\" The guy said, \"It's just what Kanye said.\" I pulled over and told them all to get the fuck out of my car. I reported the account for discrimination and got a milquetoast canned response from each of the 5 times I contacted Uber. Due to their privacy policy, they couldn't tell me whether or not the person's account was suspended.",

I\u2019m more worried about the people I see in my day to day life are believing this stuff because their \u201cidol\u201d says it. So so scary and it\u2019s great you did that, it takes a lot of courage that some might not have against men\u2026 correction\u2026 boys like that.",

I personally would be a little weirded out if I went to my professor's office hours and was offered menstrual products. \n\nPrepackaged snacks and waters are pretty safe bets, perhaps with a little sign to please help yourself.",

The menstrual products were more of like a \"Oh #$&amp;@, I just got my period and I have nothing on me type of thing\" because I haven't seen any on-campus bathrooms that actually have them stocked (I know you can get them on campus but it's not as convenient). If it makes it less weird I'm female, lol. I will look into getting more snacks/water!",

However, it is a shame the restrooms aren't stocked with some form of menstrual product!\n\nIf you really want to have a lot of coverage with snacks, I'd recommend avoiding common allergens, like nuts, and possibly include vegan/gluten-free options. Regardless, it's kind of you to work towards making a hospitable environment for students. Going to offices can be a little intimidating sometimes!",

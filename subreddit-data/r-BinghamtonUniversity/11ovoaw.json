            "comment": "I transferred from a community college into the bio program. I opted for student housing off campus and rented from a weird couple who stalked all of us living in the house and did weird drop ins. I was able to meet some cool people but struggled getting involved due to Covid and overall depression. I may of made better friends if I put myself in clubs and such. Social scene is great downtown but don\u2019t overdo it. Also take a tour of campus figure out where your classes are how you will get to them. Bing is cold, you wanna cut your walking time between buildings to as little as possible. I skipped class a-lot because it was just too cold. Piggybacking on the apartment thing if you can dorm or read reviews on the landlords because there\u2019s a lot of literal slum lords preying on students. I paid 300$ a month for rent + split utilities and wifi. But most of the nicer places I visited were 600-700$ a month. So just look around. Overall I really enjoyed my time at bing, I could of done better it\u2019s really up to you to go out and get friends since you are a transfer.",

    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm an incoming senior, and plan on taking Anatomy I, General Microbio/Genetics Lab, and a Geology gen ed this fall. I'm still a bit unsure whether I'll be taking General Microbio or the lab as I'm still debating which will be a more manageable workload. \n\nAny advice from someone that took either of these 2 classes or even both would be preferred, but if not that's ok too:) \n\nThank you!",

You have a 3 hour lab that technically should be it\u2019s own with how much you study for it lol. I took microbio and anatomy 2 at the same time and found it doable but I only had anatomy lab and no other labs. I would recommend just taking anatomy with not another lab class. Hope that helps! :)",

CUNYs are incredibly depressing in the fact that it's really hard to make friends since everyone is basically a commuter student, buildings are incredibly rundown, and they did not have as many opportunities for me at least when it came to the sciences. I don't regret choosing Bing at all.",

Also I started at Bing in Spring 2020, so the traditional college experience and making friends kinda went out the window very fast.\n\nSo in my experience, if I could go back, I would've just stayed at Baruch. I'm seriously considering finishing up my Zicklin degree whenever I can afford to go back to college",

Has a decent nightlife depending on your age. \n\nGoing to BU has to be a decision you make bc you wanna go there. BU is considered one of the elite SUNY schools but the tuition isn\u2019t worth it.

Just seeing the amount of resources they have compared to CUNY makes me feel better about my decision even if I'm not on campus yet. I also had an easier time talking to people just on a tour compared to an average day at a CUNY campus. I feel like the motto for all CUNY schools is \"Get your degree as fast as you can and get out!\". I think CUNY schools are great for working individuals/people who need a degree but have to focus more on work or other priorities, but Bing definitely encompasses the 'typical' college experience, and it doesn't hurt that it's considered a public ivy. And worst comes to worst, you can just transfer again. I know someone who went for one semester to some college in California, then SUNY Geneseo, and now CCNY. There's no good or bad decisions, there's just decisions.",

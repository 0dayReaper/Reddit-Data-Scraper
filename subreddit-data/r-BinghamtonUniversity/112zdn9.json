            "comment": "So let me give you a little advice: don\u2019t form a study group \u2026 or at any rate don\u2019t _only_ form a study group.\n\nWay back when I was an undergraduate \u2014 \u201cIn da Club\u201d by 50 Cent was the number #1 hit and dinosaurs still roamed the earth \u2014 I had a nearly identical situation. My algebraic topology prof was Hungarian. When he got frustrated with our class\u2019 inability to answer his very basic questions, he would turn and face the chalkboard and deliver the rest of the class in Hungarian. Well, we got _frustrated_ and we formed a study group that met after dinner (GroupMe didn\u2019t exist back then). Unfortunately, it was the blind leading the blind, we spent most of the time complaining about the prof because none of us could figure anything out. Long story short, 2/3rds of the class failed, I got a D and ended up being forced to retake the class by my very persistent advisor.\n\nWhat should you do:\n\n1. Go to office hours \u2014 all of them \u2014 until it starts making sense\n2. If 1. doesn\u2019t fix it, then you need to have the guts to go to the prof and say \u201clook, I\u2019m working hard in your class and coming to office hours, but it still doesn\u2019t make sense. Mind if I go to a different prof for help?\u201d They\u2019ll almost certainly say yes.\n3. Go onto BU Brain, find out who taught algorithms in the last few semesters, and ask if you can stop in for some help. They\u2019ll probably ask why you\u2019re coming to them. Tell them you did 1. and 2. already and got permission to have someone else try to explain it differently.\n\nUnfortunately, what you can\u2019t do is just struggle your way to a B- on the curve and move on with life. Algorithms and algorithm design is _everywhere_ in job interviews, and if none of it makes sense to you, those are going to be really painful interviews.",

    "postText": "I originally got admitted early to Binghamton for Comp Sci but went to a different school for my first semester. I didn\u2019t like it there but found out I equally like business so I transferred spring semester for Business Administration, especially since Binghamton doesn\u2019t allow Watson spring transfer. \n\nBecause I was already admitted originally for Comp, will tbh is make it easier to be allowed to double degree in the two? If not what is the chance I get accepted for the do Ike degree? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Not really? Pretty sure you still gotta apply to Watson to major in comp sci. SOM and Watson are two different schools, so you\u2019ll have to go through a whole process, which not many people have gone through. Try talking to an advisor from each school to estimate your chances. Good luck",

            "comment": "Are you saying you were accepted to Binghamton into Watson for CS, but didn't take the offer and went somewhere else, and now you're back at Bing in SOM? \n\nIf so, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible to get into Watson from a different school within Bing. You would be doing a \"double degree,\" not a double major, because CS is housed in Watson and not SOM. You have to specifically apply to double degree in Watson, but the CS program is very, very selective, and from what I know, they only let in three people a year as intra-university transfer (IUT) students. \n\nWhile it is technically possible, it's going to be difficult to get back into Watson. You may have a better chance because you were initially admitted, but I can't promise it. I would speak with Watson advising/admissions to see what they say, so you have a chance to explain your circumstances. \n\nDoing a double degree also usually requires staying longer than 4 years, and instead of 126 credits to graduate, it jumps to 156, so also consider if this is something you're set on.\n\nEDIT: You could always try the CS minor in Watson or even a Digital and Data Studies (DiDa) minor in Harpur worst case scenario.",

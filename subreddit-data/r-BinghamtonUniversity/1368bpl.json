    "postText": "I'm looking for a responsible, knowledgeable fish owner to take in a goldfish at the end of this semester. He has lived through the conditions at the local Petsmart, then living with 6 men who killed the 4 other fish he was purchased with originally, then killing 4 additional purchased after the first 4 died. I have insider knowledge of the second mass murder, when a roommate had his friend over to housesit over a long weekend, and (as the effects of an acid trip were wearing off) tried to pose for a sexy photo to send the primary caretaker of the fish to prove that they were being fed. As he arched his back, dangling the can of fish food above the tank, the entire lid fell off and a full cup of it poured into the tank. The emergency cleanup was frantic, and ultimately fatal for all but this remaining goldfish.\n\nI hope that you can understand why finding him a new home is very important to me. If anyone deserves it it's him, clearly, especially as the current plan for his custody is to be released into the lake in the nature preserve (let alone the ecological impact of that). So please comment or dm me!!",

My thinking is that from what I know, you can't drop your \"last\" (only) course for a semester - typically, Student Records will have to do that for you. I would say, a good start will be to email your advising office and ask.\n\nJust another thing before this though - I would doublecheck the drop date on your course, because some of them have later drop dates (like if you're trying to drop a course that's in the second term, or a \"minicourse\" that has slightly different add/drop dates). I'm assuming you're trying to drop a course that's happening currently, but I think it's worth checking to see if your course is any of the \"unusual\" ones: https://www.binghamton.edu/registrar/pdf/202360_minicoursedeadlines_list_051723_update.pdf",

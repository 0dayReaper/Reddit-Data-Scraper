    "postText": "**This is an Asynchronous Course (No scheduled meetings) and it fulfils the P &amp; N Gen Ed Requirements**\n\nHere's a brief description of the course:\n\nIn this course, we will explore experiences of Asian and Latin American immigration to the US and address critical questions: How does our immigration system work? Is there an American Dream? Should there be no borders? And analyze the surge of nativist movements in the United States today. Materials for this course include testimonial literature and short stories, like Francisco Jimenez's *The Circuit*; we will explore digital archives of accounts, such as *We Are Witnesses*, and documentaries about the reality of the migration journey. We will complement these collections of stories with scholarly articles and podcasts that explain concepts and systems of migration, which will provide a solid theoretical knowledge of migration studies.\n\nIf you have any question email me at: [mrodri89@binghamton.edu](mailto:mrodri89@binghamton.edu)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhq72lmnf8xa1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=85e581a970fc96b9bb54aefeea02e72239ad6fc2",

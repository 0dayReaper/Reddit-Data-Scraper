Most of the cancellations made for today were preemptive, and made on the assumption that the weather would have been worse. There would have never been thoughts of a cancellation if the forecast showed what ended up happening.",

And they are probably more serious about safety at local school level and have certain policies in place. I don't know the number, but I'd say at least half or more than that of the population attending BU lives on campus, which is usually squeaky clean by the time students wake up to attend their classes.",

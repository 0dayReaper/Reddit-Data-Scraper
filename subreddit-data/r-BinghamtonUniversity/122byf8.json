    "postText": "I got accepted into the SoM accelerated 4+1 program with a concentration in marketing (the one where classes start in summer and you get a masters in one academic year) and was wondering any info about what the overall workload is like (homework, difficulty of exams, etc). Any advice on easy electives is welcome too. The course load is as follows:\n\nSummer:\n\n* MGMT 500: Management Information Systems\n* MGMT 501: Accounting for Managers\n* MGMT 505: Corporate Finance for Managers\n* MGMT 508: Organizational Behavior \n\nFall:\n\n*  MGMT 504: Programming for Business Analytics\n* MGMT 506: Marketing for Managers\n* MGMT 507: Operations Management\n* MGMT 516: Business Communications\n* 2 electives\n\nSpring:\n\n* MGMT 540: Strategic Management\n* 4 electives",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm seeking advice regarding my schedule for the next semester, and any input is appreciated. I'm planning to take CS320, CS350, and either CS373 or CS432 (database elective). Any suggestions on whether to take 373 or 432? On another note, if anyone has taken 432, how was the class? I'm not too concerned about difficulty, but would like to know if Bing's database course is any good. Thank you for any advice!",

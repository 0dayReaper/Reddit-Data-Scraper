Faculty don\u2019t take colleagues to any of those (they also probably wouldn\u2019t take them to PS, but that\u2019s a different story). We\u2019re looking for a restaurant off campus that you\u2019d use to say \u201cyou could imagine being faculty here \u2026 see, we\u2019re a cosmopolitan city!\u201d\n\nOn campus, that restaurant is the Chenango Room, but it isn\u2019t fussy, pretentious. But I\u2019m not sure what the off campus answer is. It used to be Number Five, IMHO. Maybe it\u2019s PS now.",

My wife\u2019s birthday dinner was the day before the COVID dine in restriction began, we were amongst the last two or three parties that night, and they never reopened after the pandemic. But it was also the closest thing we had to a fussy NYC steakhouse, so a lot of faculty would drag visiting speakers and faculty candidates there.",

There's maybe 4 restaurants in Bing that could be considered expensive, and all the ones I've been to justify their prices with good food/experience.

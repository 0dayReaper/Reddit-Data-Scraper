I\u2019m entering as a Chem major and I\u2019m taking BC Calc rn and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get a 5 (maybe a 4) on the ap test. Do I need to take the test if I get a 5?",

But I think from looking at the requirements for chem, you may be ok HOWEVER it may also depend what chemistry degree and what track you are taking",

            "comment": "Advisor (sorta) chiming in. \n\nIf you do get a 5 on the AP Calc BC exam, you will receive credit for MATH 224 (2 credits), MATH 225 (2 credits), MATH 226 (2 credits) and MSCI XXX (2 credits)\\*, so overall you will get 8 credits, and your Mathematics (M) gen ed fulfilled. You can find AP exam equivalences [here](https://www.binghamton.edu/harpur/advising/transfer-credit/ap-equivalencies/index.html).\n\nNow, in regard to the MSCI XXX (2 credits)\\*, \"\\*Students with a score of 5 may opt for a MATH 227 placement exam with the MATH department. Upon successful completion of the placement exam, students will receive credit for MATH 227 instead of MSCI XXX.\" \n\nSo, as people will mentioned, you'll get credit for all of Calc I (MATH 224/MATH 225), and HALF of Calc II (MATH 226). You'll need to pass the placement test to receive credit for the remaining half of Calc II, which is MATH 227. I don't think there's a limit to how many times you can take it, but worst case scenario, you can also take a stand-alone 2 cr. MATH 227 course.\n\nAs far as I know, you shouldn't need the Calc Placement test since you should be able to either receive credit for all of Calc II, or jump into MATH 227, and the placement test is typically for people beginning Calc. Just to be sure, maybe reach out to the MATH department for clarity, but according to [this](http://www2.math.binghamton.edu/p/calculus/placementtestfaq), I am fairly confident you do not need to take it. \n\n\"I have a score of X on the AP Calculus YZ test. Do I need to take the Placement Test?\n\n  \nAnswer: All students who want to take Math 224, Math 223, or Math 220 must pass the Placement Test.  \nIf your AP score satisfies the University's requirements for Math 224/225 credit then you will be given credit for Math 224/225 and you may not take Math 224/225 for credit, so you do not need to take the Placement Test. The University policies for AP credit are different for the different schools of the University, so you should contact your school for the policies that apply to you.  \nIf you do not yet know your AP score then you need to make a decision: Either take the Placement Test during the summer or wait until the end of the summer and take the Placement Test only if your AP score does not meet the University's requirements for Math 224/225 credit. The advantage to taking the Placement Test during May/June or early summer is that you can register for Math 224 if you pass (it is easier to drop a course later than to add one) and you can retake the test at the end of the summer if you fail.\"",

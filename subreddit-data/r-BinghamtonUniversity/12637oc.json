I want to be pretty close to the gym and the biology dept. as I\u2019m majoring in neuroscience and want my classes to be accessible. Any advice?",

It\u2019s absolutely fine except for Oneida which is the worst in CIW. CIW is closer to a lot of things too, but the dining hall is closed on the weekends or it has been for as long as I\u2019ve been here so y have to walk to another one which isn\u2019t so bad. The only pro of CIW over the others is that it\u2019s cheaper and everyone seems to think the community is great. Other than that Mtview and Dickinson are definitely \u201cnicer\u201d but more expensive, generally farther away from stuff but not to a crazy extent, and if you\u2019re rly trying for a suite I believe they have a lot more suites than CIW",

Btw being near the biology dept is impossible and also not necessary as your classes will be held mostly in the lecture hall, if you want to be near the lecture hall, go for Hinman (don\u2019t bc it\u2019s shit). Most biol faculty is in science 3 but there\u2019s no housing near there and also you won\u2019t have any classes there (also if you\u2019re neuro it would be more helpful to be near the psych department which is in science 4). Gym is far from everything but Newing but Dickinson is next to there so it\u2019s not too much more of a walk. CIW and Mountainview are farther and less nice. Feel free to DM me, I\u2019m a UniBuddy Ambassador.",

            "comment": "Dickinson has very nice/modern dorms, and the location isn\u2019t too bad either. It\u2019s a little over ten minutes by foot from the dorms to the lecture hall/classroom wing, a bit further for the science buildings. Only real downside is that your dining hall is 1) shared with Newing and 2) the worst one on campus imo, but it\u2019s open for night owl which is nice. Also, avoid Old Digman at all costs - it\u2019s on the opposite side of campus, disconnected from everything, and the building\u2019s in really bad shape. Regular Digman and the rest of Dickinson are good tho. \n\nCIW is where I currently live. My experience living here has been generally positive, however my dorm (Mohawk) is very different from the other ones since it was built later. Most of the dorms in CIW are on the older side, though in my experience only Oneida is truly terrible. CIW is right across the street from the Union (which includes the Marketplace), and a quick walk to the library and lecture halls. The dining hall, while decent enough, closes on weekends. Luckily CIW is equidistant from every other dining hall on campus. I\u2019d recommend living in Mohawk specifically, and the rest of CIW sans Oneida only if you can\u2019t get into the other communities. It is cheaper than the other communities, except for Hinman, so if cost\u2019s a factor this might be a good option. \n\nMountainview, like Dickinson, is on the modern/better quality side. The dorms are probably the most spacious you can get as a Freshman. The dining hall is decent, and it\u2019s relatively close to Hinman\u2019s dining hall (which is my personal favorite). The real challenge with Mountainview is that goddamn hill; if you aren\u2019t in shape at the start of the semester, that better quickly change. It\u2019s also pretty isolated compared to the other communities. \n\nThe gym is far away from pretty much everything btw, but the campus shuttle stops there. None of the dorms are near the biology department to my knowledge, but that\u2019s much more walkable.",

I don't know what being near a dept. has to do with classes because classes are held in lecture halls and classroom buildings and depts. are in admin. buildings mostly, but the closest to academic buildings for the most part is Hinman, closest to gym is probably Newing/Dickinson. Mountainview is up on a hill far away from everything",

Can I get my amazon fresh cart delivered to my apartment directly? How would I put the address for it? Thanks. :)",

            "comment": "I'm pretty sure Amazon Fresh isn't available in Binghamton.  Grocery delivery to the best of my knowledge is limited to Instacart and [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com).  If you're ordering food products from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), they would likely go to the package room. \n\nYou might be able to give Walmart/Instacart drivers special instructions, similar to how students have restaurants deliver to their dorms. Not sure, never lived on campus.",

    "postText": "So Bing was my top school and I only got accepted into the BAP program where you take classes at Suny Broome. My goal is to major in business and complete the pre requisites for dental school while doing this, and maintaining very high grades to improve my chances of dental school. Does anyone know if it will be hard to take classes outside my major at brooke for the prereqs to dental school and would doing this program affect my ability of getting into dental school at all?",

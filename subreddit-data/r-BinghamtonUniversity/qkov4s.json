For those recreationally using stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine, we also provide fentanyl test strips so you can make an informed decision about the substance you're using. For those using intravenously, we offer syringe exchange services in partnership with STAP.\n\nSubstance use occurs on a spectrum from experimental use to Substance Use Disorder, and it's totally normal for young people to experiment with substances (we accept this with alcohol use, right?). Please, take the steps to keep yourselves and your peers safer by getting education and tools to support reduced harm.\n\nWe also offer in-person grief groups, a family support group for those navigating the complex experience of loving someone suffering from addiction, and a free, online education series called Clearing the Confusion.\n\nIf you have any questions, send a message here - https://m.facebook.com/TruthPharm/ - I'm usually the one checking and responding to messages.\n\nHope to hear from y'all. \u2665\ufe0f",

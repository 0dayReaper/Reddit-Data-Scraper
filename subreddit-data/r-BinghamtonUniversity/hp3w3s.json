    "postText": "\nYour college experience is one of the main gears that drives my hometown. What you classify as your higher education is considered to be a major lifeline to this community. You, wether knowingly or unknowingly, provide the residents of this small metropolitan area with your presence, diversity, and ultimately - money. \n\nTonight was rainy. Every light seemed to glisten and reflect off of the pavement. As I drove westbound on Route 17, I saw the lights of my hometown nestled in the valley below. Off in the distance, I see the lights of Bartle, prophetically, glowing green. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the presence of a major international university in my home, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to have some of the greatest loves of my life. People who I hold dear to my heart and I will never not have love for. People who I have learned from, and grown from my experience with. I am not the sole townie who\u2019s experienced this. And I\u2019m not the only townie who wishes there was more here for you to make you stay. \n\nI don\u2019t think you quite realize exactly what you bring to my community. Growing up, downtown Binghamton was *not* the place you\u2019d want to be. I never once thought that I would ever see the abandoned factories turned into anything, let alone a nursing school. I never once thought that I\u2019d meet people from Long Island, Australia, or China and show them where I went to high school. \n\nIt would be quixotic to assume that things will return to normal anytime soon, or even assume that our previous normal will return. But I sincerely hope that, in any capacity, you come here. You bring yourselves to my town and share yourself with us, if not for me, then for the next wave of kids from my rainy, reflective streets.",

I for one remember when the UP was a vacant mall with occasionally a stabbing or two..\n\nNow it's almost its own city..\n\nIs the transition perfect. No, be uts moving forward not backwards. The highway path is a great improvement,  students falling the road , in the dark took at life and it would have been more.\n\nThose lights around the campus roads are enough thought out through.\n\n\nJust a heads up for students, driver's, mostly in  the rain cant see anyone at the crosswaks. Look up most of the lights are not pvwr the crosswalk. And take alook before walking. Someone may not see you, and the right of way does nit make waist down paralyzed for life  in a wheelchair seem like a good trade.,\n\nAldo have they put a side walk across from yhe vis stop. So many students and 1 side walk. It's logistically impossible for all the pedestrian traffic to not be in yhe road. That's on the school.\n\nBut when I drive, I would give the studets  a high grade as veing cool and repectfyk and good conversation.  A++\n\nLike 2 problems in 6000 rides.  \n\nAnd way more laughs and graet rides. \n\nEnjoy the area, we like the new tou g blood. Better than the old crotchety locals.",

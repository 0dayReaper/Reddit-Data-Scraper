They definitely have nice rooms compared to the other Hinman buildings though (don't go to the other Hinman buildings!) \n\n2) There are elevators in Cleveland and they're much better than other dorms such as, say, Smith. Also Cleveland is the only Hinman dorm with AC and for freshmen only \n\n3) Hinman as far as I've heard is not too bad if you're in Cleveland or some of the other buildings. The other buildings may be quite older and run down than Cleveland but just avoid Smith. Also, the dining hall is pretty good (noodle house is amazing there!) \n\nAnd Hinman is close to app as well and the lecture Hall, so the walks should not be too bad unless you have classes in Whitney Hall or OJ\n\nlet me know if you have any other questions or anything!",

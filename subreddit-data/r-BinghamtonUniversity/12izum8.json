Here\u2019s the link:\n\nhttps://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/contact/ambassador.html\n\nUnibuddys also say where they\u2019re from, so if you have a question about travel that\u2019s a good way to find someone from the same area as you. You can also sort by major if you have a major specific question.",

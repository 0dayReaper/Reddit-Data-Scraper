    "postText": "My son is going as a 3rd year student to Binghamton. I\u2019m paying for tuition and his lodgings. I\u2019m wondering how much to give him for living expenses per month. He has always had a job and intends to get one when he gets to college. I want to give him the minimum necessary to survive decently but not spoil his work ethic. What is a fair amount?",

            "comment": "why not ask him? if he's already been in college for 2 years he probably has a good idea of how much money he spends on a weekly/monthly basis. this is also a pretty personal question since it will depend on what he spends money on (how is he going to get food? will he need to buy extra stuff for his room? what does he do on weekends? etc)",

But he'll probably have a hard time finding an on campus job since they're very competitive and limited so he should be aware that he might need outside employment which will be hard if he doesnt have a car.",

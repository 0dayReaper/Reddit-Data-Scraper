    "postText": "Hello, I am currently a Harpur Senior, and I plan to pursue an MSEd in School Counseling after graduation. I realize that Binghamton does not currently offer this \n, but I was wondering if anyone who may be privy to the inner workings of the CCPA might know if they plan on rolling out this program. I know there\u2019s a MPP in the works for next semester, just curious if a Masters of School Counseling may be on its way.",

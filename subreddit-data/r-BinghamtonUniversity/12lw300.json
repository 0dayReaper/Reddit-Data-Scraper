All the other buildings there are fine though",

            "comment": "I really enjoy living in a suite. Not only do you get a common room to hang out and chill in, you also avoid having to deal with communal bathrooms lol. However, I will say that the social aspect does suffer. My floor is socially dead since everyone just sticks with their suitemates. I\u2019m happy with that since I\u2019m an introvert, but it\u2019s not for everyone.\n\nThe dorms you should avoid are Oneida and Old Digman (not to be confused with regular Digman. Neither of them are renovated, and Old Digman in particular is *extremely* isolated from pretty much everything.\n\nI\u2019m in Mohawk (CIW) and I really like it since it\u2019s so centrally located, plus the building itself is modern. Dickinson is also a solid choice on those grounds, and Cleveland (in Hinman) might also be great since it\u2019s right next to the lecture halls and newly renovated.",

In a suite you create a tight-knit bond with your suite which is hard to replicate, but you barely meet other people on your floor (especially for Dickinson and Mountain View). Newing allows you to meet hundreds of new kids the day you arrive and so many options as to who you want your friends to be. Always something going and people constantly doing something. I wish I lived in newing and always give people this advice.",

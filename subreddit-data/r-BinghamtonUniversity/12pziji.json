I've heard quite a few people drag both physics 1 and 2 here, but I'm taking physics 1 right now and it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Anyone who has taken physics 1 and 2 here, are they about the same, or is physics 2 worse?",

            "comment": "Honestly it\u2019s about the same- I\u2019m an upper classman in physics 2, and honestly the hardest part is that it feels like a first year class. It takes up a lot of time and effort; there\u2019s a lot of class time, homework, labs, etc- and since I\u2019m in a STEM program and have multiple 4 hours lab per week, plus my upper level coursework, it\u2019s just not a course I can realistically dedicate an extreme amount of time to. I\u2019m also not sure if it\u2019s different in the odd season. If physics can be more of a main focus for you, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem, there\u2019s a lot of freebie points",

We also have a common room, brand new furniture, and wood flooring everywhere so it\u2019s easy to clean. Plus unlike the other communities, hinman is home and you get a sense of community where you are able to be openly friends with a huge chunk of your building. In a place like newing or Dickinson you can go the whole year without talking to a person on your floor easily, but not in hinman because people are friendly there.",

If price isn't the major concern than you have a high chance of getting a nice dorm. Cleveland is nice because hinman is the cheapest to dorm and Cleveland is fully renovated. As a freshman I couldn't get Dickinson or Mountainview, but there were plenty of open newing spots. All of CIW is also nice besides Oneida, and it is the same cost as hinman.",

If you are more extroverted I would really recommend suites over doubles if you come here.  \n\nIf you can try to get a suite in CIW (but only Mohawk all the other buildings are not the greatest) or Dickinson.  Cleveland is acceptable ig\u2026 but the rest of hinman is kinda shit as well (there is only 1 bathroom for 6 people per suite in hinman).  Mountain View is ok but it is out of the way tbh it\u2019s got nice suites though.  I personally live in Mohawk and I think it\u2019s the best building on campus.\n\nIf you are looking for a double then I would suggest CIW and particularly Onondaga.  Newing also has doubles but they are super far from lecture hall and most of your classes.  The only reason I would go to Newing is if you were really interested in Greek life.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t have AP/IB credits your selection will be really shitty.  If that\u2019s a deal breaker for you then I might consider Buffalo but if you have a decent amount of credits and do your research you will probably be able to find a good place to live here.",

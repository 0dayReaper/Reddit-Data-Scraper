I sent in my app all the way back in January and haven't gotten any email updates even though imo my stats are pretty standard for what I've seen people being accepted with. I'm wondering if anyone else hasn't heard back or also haven't been asked for course progress report?? I was accepted to SBU mid March but Bing is my preferrable choice and I'm getting antsy cause stony's decision date is May 1st. someone make me feel better pls",

But, I wouldn\u2019t panic yet there\u2019s probably a set back in the admissions office. But start considering other options in the mean time and maybe send a letter of continued interest. Best of luck !",

    "postText": "Coming in as a freshmen in the fall I was slightly confused on the suites. I\u2019ve heard differing things but are freshmen allowed to pick who else is in their suites besides their general roomate. Or (if let\u2019s say it\u2019s a 6 person suite) the other 4 people are completely random. I\u2019m just trying to see if it logistically makes sense to look for other people besides my roomate to live with but don\u2019t want to if that\u2019s not even a choice.",

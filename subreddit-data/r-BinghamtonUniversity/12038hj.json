    "postText": "How does someone go about getting into a lab as an undergrad on campus? I\u2019ve skipped a year as I\u2019m trying to graduate early (2024) and have yet to be in a lab. All my friends in labs have been there since sophomore year, I need a required class, or the labs just don\u2019t want more UGs. I will be a senior next year and am worried that I won\u2019t be able to get into a lab, since one of my colleagues said most don\u2019t take seniors.",

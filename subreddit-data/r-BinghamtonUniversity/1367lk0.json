    "postText": "Hi! I submitted my application as a transfer (sophomore) student past the priority deadline. Did anybody do the same, but still get accepted? I got accepted last year, but I\u2019m worried that me submitting my application as a transfer will really hinder my chances. Also I applied to the School of Management, not knowing I didn\u2019t complete all the prerequisites. Can I still be accepted into the University, just not that specific school? \n\nPlease let me know anybody!!!!\nI am extremely desperate for answers and advice. I really do not want to attend my current CUNY school any further!",

I love it here so much and it's better than any CUNY school I've been to (looked at CSI and KBCC as well). It feels like an actual university compared to what you would get down in NYC.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, this may be a shot in the dark but is there a groupme for chem106?\n\nMy lab report grade is out and its pretty bad but my teammates think it\u2019s not that awful so they don\u2019t want to meet more often and just want to fix the problems. I want to get into medical school and this grade is not good enough and I want to see what I can do to improve my lab reports because we don\u2019t get a do over for the other lab report we have to write so i just want to know if theres a group chat for this course for tips and pointers. Thanks",

I tried to go to the ones I could make and the TA was unhelpful and a bit rude. I just want to be able to ask quick questions to make sure Im doing things correctly",

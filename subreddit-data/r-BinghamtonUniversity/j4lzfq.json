Also some people need to visit home for various reasons and see their families and are entitled to do so, the school never mandated anything involving visiting home, just to not socialize a lot. Binghamton was never completely covid free, it\u2019s a city with many young people who frequent the same places",

The biggest thing is also kids leaving campus and Binghamton to visit friends at other schools or just go on trips to other places which Ik of a bunch of ppl who do that. And the other thing is for the first few weeks, if I\u2019m not mistaken, they didn\u2019t do the surveillance testing so maybe the results we\u2019re scewed as a result. Ultimately, by not testing off campus kids when they arrived a spike was bound to happen, college kids and humans in general are social by nature, ultimately everyone who chooses to live here during the semester is doing so to socialize w people of their age and have fun after being locked in their room for the past half a year. The last thing is also the fact that a lot of ppl in Binghamton think this is all just a hoax and don\u2019t take the preventive measures serious.",

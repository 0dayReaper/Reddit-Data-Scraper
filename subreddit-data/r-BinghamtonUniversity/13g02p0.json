    "postText": "Hi BU friends. I have my commencement ceremony at 8:30 tm, but I don't feel adequately prepared, as we only received a small set of directions for the ceremony. It all seems kind of vague, and my autistic self really needs more info in order to not be anxious at the ceremony to the point where I might end up making a fool of myself in some way. Any advice from prior grads as to what specifically I should do before and during the ceremony would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

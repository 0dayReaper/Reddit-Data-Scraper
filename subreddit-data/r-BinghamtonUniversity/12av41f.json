    "postText": "Lots of great info here, however why does BAP exist? What is the reason for the program? Is it space in Bing classrooms, lack of professors or unmet applicant requirements? I was recently accepted to BAP, but struggling with the idea of this plan. I applied as a bio major. My courses/gpa not an issue. Any info you can share would be great. Thanks!",

            "comment": "It can be difficult to make friends as a transfer student coming from a community college, and is a reason students drop out after transferring. BAP exists as a way to allow you to live socially as a Binghamton student for all four years here.\n\nI wouldn't think of BAP as a Binghamton program that offloads students to BCC, but as a BCC/Binghamton 2+2 or 1+3 partnership.",

                    "comment": "Originally, the program was designed as a way for applicants to highly competitive programs with just barely sub-standard GPAs to begin at BCC and then, in essence, take the spots of those who (somewhat inevitably) dropped out of those competitive programs. This certainly didnt include every competitive program, but a certain subsection of programs that could be completed in their first year through BCC. This would essentially allow admissions to accept more students to a program than the number of Freshman seats would reasonably allow with the understanding that those seats that would free up due to those would transfer out of that program would then immediately be filled. \n\nThis was not 100% the only reason, but it was a large portion of it.",

Around 92-95 high school GPA and around 1150-1250 SAT score. \n\nMy high school GPA was 93 and SAT was 1170 so my own personal theory (as well as my classmates\u2019) was Binghamton didn\u2019t want to skew their stats and have us BAP students lower Binghamton\u2019s median SAT acceptance, so they technically don\u2019t accept us, but Broome accepts us and we can complete our first year there. \n\nI\u2019m very grateful for the program and I think it\u2019s an amazing thing. My Binghamton GPA is near perfect because I don\u2019t have my math gen ed weighing it down, thanks to me being able to take it at Broome in 2020.",

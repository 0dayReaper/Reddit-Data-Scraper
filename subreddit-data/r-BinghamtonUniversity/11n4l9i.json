    "postText": "All Harpur students are required to have 126 credits total, a third (46 credits) of which must be upper-level (courses level 300 and above). \n\nI'm running into a lot of students who don't know this and who cannot graduate on time as a result. You can see how many credits you have in the large paragraph at the top of your DegreeWorks.",

All the production leads where told to order less in a meeting Tuesday. Information on the contract came from a chef last semester. I believe the contract is up June of next year, that I'm not totally sure about, but it's in that year.",

If the college thinks that it can make more money from a different company running dining services, they don't have to renew the contract.

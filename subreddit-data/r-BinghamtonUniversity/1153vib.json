    "postText": "I am currently a Bio major and am just about done with my degree as a second semester Junior? Hypothetically, would it still be possible to declare a second major in let\u2019s say  economics and then just graduate a year later? I did the math and I would be able to complete it by spring 2025. Would the school cut me off at 4 years or deny me declaring a new major so late? Not committed to this idea yet but just asking as to weight my options for the future.",

You won't get a job solely off of your majors, they're not listed on your degree. It's really up to you if you want to stay another year (or more), but you might just be better served looking for a job.",

If you want to just pivot to another field, you probably don't need a major. Just take the important courses (maybe a minor) and get an internship or other experience in that field.",

I think a really important consideration which has not been mentioned yet is that a lot of scholarships/financial aid only carry over for the first 4 years. If you fall into this category, I would definitely stop by the Financial Aid office to work through the specific if money is at all a factor for you.\n\nThe other thing you may want to consider is just going straight to a masters program.  Why spend more time getting a second bachelors when you could earn a higher degree in the same time?  If you are thinking Econ, check out the MBA +1 that can be tacked on to any major in Harpur.  Not the same, but a similar field.  You do NOT need prior experience in a field to earn a masters degree in it. This is a very common misconception!",

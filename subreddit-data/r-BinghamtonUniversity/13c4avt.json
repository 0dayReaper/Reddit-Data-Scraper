Students majoring in anthropology (BA or BS), biology (BA or BS), integrative neuroscience (BS) and linguistics (BA) can combine their undergraduate degree with a master's degree (MA or MS) in anthropology.\"\n\nIt doesn't hurt to reach out to the program director (in the comment below) to ask, though. The worst they can say is no. Also check out the link I put above since it has a lot of useful info about the ANTH 4+1.",

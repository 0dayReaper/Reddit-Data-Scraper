    "postText": "Okay, so I\u2019ll be coming to Bing as a junior as I\u2019m almost done with CC and paid my enrollment deposit back in March thinking that I\u2019ll be able to register for my classes. I had originally had a time ticket for April 19th and when I sent out my updated transcript (with fall 2022 grades), the system was saying I don\u2019t have a time ticket at all. B4 you ask, I was originally put as a sophomore standing 1 and moved up to standing 2 because all of my credits were evaluated after sending out the transcript. Now I\u2019m getting told that I can\u2019t register until orientation which doesn\u2019t take place until June. How would that ensure that I will be able to get the classes I need?",

OP I wouldn't take this advice.\n\nOP you need to contact Student Records if you don't have a time ticket, they're the ones who issue them. Email them ASAP and then you can hopefully meet with an advisor to register.",

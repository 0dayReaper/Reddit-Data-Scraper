    "postText": "Hi! I am a prospective student for the Class of 2027 at Binghamton. I am wondering if anyone can answer questions about learning accommodations. I have a diagnosed processing disorder and it has affected me in high school.\n\nI have been primarily looking at liberal arts schools so Binghamton is a change. Being a larger institution, I am worried that I wouldn\u2019t have enough accessibility to one-on-one support from professors/TAs because I need extra time to go over assignments. How do their office hours work, in general? I am going into biology for pre-med. Essentially, I don\u2019t want to be a number in a class. Everything like extra time, etc is required already so not a concern.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "If you genuinely need small classes, and one on one attention from your professor, Binghamton is not the right school for you. In most majors, introductory classes range from 50 to 500 students.\n\nThat abates with upper level classes, which can be very small and individualized. \n\nFor the small class experience, suggest you either start at a community college, and transfer to a larger school once you've fulfilled those pre-reqs, or pick a smaller school.",

            "comment": "Hello there! Im currently a TA for Binghamton and the first piece of advice for you is that you need to contact SSD, Services for Students with Disabilities. You can contact them via email and ask them to provide you an accommodation letter suited with the appropriate accommodations. I recommend doing this at least two weeks before the semester starts, as you need some time to get the documents they are gonna require and time to process your letter.\n\nOnce you get an accommodation letter, it\u2019ll be sent to all your professors and TAs. I have had a few students with SSD accommodations, and usually it\u2019s recommended that you have a talk with with your profs/TAs about how they may help you. Sometimes students don\u2019t need accommodations for some of their classes, but if you know you need one for all your classes, you must get in touch with your professors and TAs. If you have any more questions, please let me know!",

That and because people took advantage of the system by faking IEPs to get accommodations they didn't need nor deserved.So if you don't have a formal diagnosis **GET IT NOW**! Most insurance companies for some God Forsaken reason stop covering psych evaluations after you turn 18 (I guess to make everyone's lives needlessly more miserable for the sake of profit like everything else in this world). So please, please, please get it done now. You'll save yourself a lot of hassle since without that piece of paper, SSD can't and won't help you. So even though 10% of BU students are registered with SSD, there are hundreds if not thousands more that just have to tough it out because they lack proper documentation. And no, the University doesn't do psych evaluations for students either",

Binghamton has been great at accommodating my needs through special services and supportive professors. their team is absolutely amazing and genuinely care about helping students succeed. if you had accommodations in hs then they should transfer over well, you may need to do an intake meeting. definitely reach out to the office of SSD for more info, but that\u2019s 100% the route you should go rn\n\nalso\n\ntheres tutoring services for free at the school, absolute godsend. also just talk to your professors and tell them you\u2019re nervous for the class. even in big lectures, they know their students. let them see you show up to class every time, sit in the front, raise your hand, and have conversations with the professor on literally anything you want to talk about. professors aren\u2019t hollywood stars they\u2019re here for you! even if you\u2019re an absolute potato, as long as you\u2019re trying your best they will give you everything they can to help",

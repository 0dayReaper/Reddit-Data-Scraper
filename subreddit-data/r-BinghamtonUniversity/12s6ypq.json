If students do not place into MATH 220 or 224, then MATH 108 or MATH 223 (or the equivalent) is also a required course for completion of the major. If students do not place into MATH 108, then MATH 107 is also required for completion of major.\n\nTo be granted the Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting from SOM, students must complete the following courses:\nA. Liberal Arts\n1.\u00a0Requirements\n* ECON 162 Macroeconomics\n* ECON 160 Microeconomics\n* MATH 220, MATH 224 and 225: Calculus\"\n\nDoesn't look like it. If you do a fancy specialization in Accounting then you might (in which case I'd ask SOM advising), but otherwise no.",

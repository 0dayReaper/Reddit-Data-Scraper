Basically a fancy programmed camera hooked up to a monitor that sets off an audio alert if someone in the frame is standing closer than six feet to someone else. Impressive feat of engineering, but yes, also creepy and annoying (believe me when I say they are *loud*). The interface looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/5ziZZmv). \n\n\"Anti-Covid Bot was developed by Watson Institute for Systems Excellence (WISE) and it helps to improve the safety of everyone in the campus community by encouraging social distancing and wearing masks. It does not save any videos.\"",

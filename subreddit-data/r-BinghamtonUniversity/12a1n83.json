Other than that I'd say making friends in class never hurt and actually helped me with my work and studying a ton. There's plenty of places to find friends on campus and it's such a large and diverse campus there's no need to worry about fitting in. Congratulations on getting in!!!",

I started in fall 2020 but did online my first year and it was really rough moving in in fall 2021. But it\u2019s really up to you bc I just didn\u2019t try that hard lol. I thought the friends would just come to me and there would always be stuff going on but if you don\u2019t seek that out it doesn\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t worry about it if you really want to go to Bing but that\u2019s what\u2019s stopping you",

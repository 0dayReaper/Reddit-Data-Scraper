To be honest I really have not heard great things about Fochler's section myself. I'd say maybe try to transfer into Polunchenko's section if you can. If this isn't feasible, best advice is to just attend study sessions/tutoring, and honestly Youtube helps a lot sometimes.",

That being said students who go to lecture tend to perform much better. but thats likely also tied to the students going to lecture are well motivated and would do well regardless but, food for thought regardless.\n\nthe content isnt anything crazy on the stats end. Fochler moved at a blinding pace last semester but Dr. Polinchenko moved at a very reasonable pace. the course (for dr. polumchenko) started at histograms and ended at hypothesis testing, if you have taken stats before you know what that means if not it was up to like chapter 23 of the book.\n\nAlso be good friends with your TA, go to office hours and pay attention in discussion. if you find yourself struggling in lecture theyre your best bet (and there sowcifically to help you)",

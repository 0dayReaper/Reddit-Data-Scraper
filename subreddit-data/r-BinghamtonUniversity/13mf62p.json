I also X out the dates on the calendar as they go by, so I can easily tell at a glance how many days I have before something is due.\n\nYou still ultimately have to take responsibility and pace yourself accordingly. But I've found that having the due dates in your face along with a countdown tends to encourage me to at least get started, which is always the hardest part",

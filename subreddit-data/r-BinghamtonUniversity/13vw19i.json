    "postText": "Hi all,\nI wanted to share my experience at bing as a transfer student who came in spring 2023 and wanted to get ur input on my experience. \nWhen I first transferred, I was hoping for a more social environment as I didn\u2019t have many friends in high school and went to a small community college in fall 2022. But as soon as I got to bing, I honestly couldn\u2019t believe just how cliquey it was. My roommate had absolutely no interest in interacting with anybody besides his high school friends, which he would invite over on weekends and practically kick me out. So I tried joining a club or two, but got way bogged down on my schedule and plus ppl in the clubs already knew each other and it was super cliquey there too. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but do u guys think bing is really like another 4 years of high school? Literally every time I ate in the dining hall I ate alone, and I even tried to sit with people but some even became uncomfortable and even unfriendly and proceeded to walk away. And if they talked to me, and a ran into them again somewhere else in campus they would avoid me. \n\nIt was a truly isolating experience. I write this to not only gain the perspective of other students who maybe have had similar issues, but to warn future transfers of this since I think this may even be a transfer specific phenomenon. Now, I am even transferring again out of Binghamton because I wasn\u2019t even able to make one friend and was soo lonely and isolated.\n\nBe careful. Binghamton is a very, very cliquey school with a lot of people who have absolutely no interest in meeting others. And it makes for students to become isolated and depressed.",

I went to those club fairs in the beginning of the school year and spoke to a bunch of people. I ended up interning for a club and going to meetings for others. \n\nI also reached out to other transfer students since there\u2019s a good network that connects you to other transfers. I made a few friends initially and we would all go out to the bars and frats. I made alot more friends when I\u2019d go out and meet people while I was drunk. \n\nAlso just always saying \u201chi\u201d to my neighbors on the floor and stuff, going as far as knocking on their door to ask questions and stuff. \n\nI would also never say \u201cno\u201d to hanging out in the beginning even if I didnt feel like it. \n\nalso to a certain degree tinder did help, I met my now boyfriend on there but it allowed me to meet new people, mostly guys, but then you meet their friends and stuff and grow a circle of people that you casually know. \n\nNow most of my friends are people who\u2019ve been here long before me and not just transfers. You really have to put yourself out there.",

Why don't they want to be my friend?\" \n\nMaking friends and being social is a skill set that needs to be practiced. I'm guessing op is just starting to learn social skills and is coming off differently than they think. The beginning can be rough which if why it's better to do it when you're younger so that you can bounce back faster.",

People are just burnt out during the spring semester. \n\nIf most people are avoiding you, you're probably also just awkward and make people uncomfortable. It's probably you, not cliqueyness. And that's okay - you'll figure it out and you'll make friends. \n\nClasses, clubs, and the randomest places are where you will make friends.",

New coming freshman have it the best bc of freshman dorms and everyone being stuck in the same boat!

If it makes you feel better, I was a first semester freshman at Bing and I didn\u2019t make my serious friendships until about junior year. I didn\u2019t have many friends growing up and I kind of had to learn a lot of social cues in college that most people pick up a lot younger.\n\nHave you considered taking a deep look at HOW you\u2019re approaching/talking to people? You mention that you\u2019re more outgoing now but if the way you come off makes people avoid you then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s cliqueishness, I think it might be an issue with your communication.\n\nObviously I don\u2019t know you and can\u2019t pass actual judgement on your social behavior, but from your comments it seems like you expect too much from people you either have just met or haven\u2019t met at all. Friendship isn\u2019t something you snap your fingers and have, it\u2019s something you have to work for. There were several points where I felt like I would never be close to someone who is now one of my best friends, but after years of spending time together and getting to know her as a person, I have the honor of being one of her bridesmaids.\n\nI really hope things get better for you, and I\u2019m sure they will. Just keep trying and be patient!",

I've been out of college for nearly 20 years but socializing and interacting have had the same challenges and issues for centuries. I find this type of problems affecting people I work with or interview. Great resumes but can't get past the first interview....must be biased work places or stupid interviewers or jobs being given to only friends. When challenges like this come up, people need to be willing to look in the mirror more and work on very hard personality and communication issues, and this almost always requires an unbiased external perspective. I'd encourage you to approach some of the university's career development/mentor resources and see if you can guidance on your interview capabilities. This is direct feedback on how you come off as a first impression, albeit in a professional setting, but you can ask for notes and suggestions that you could apply in your social life. Its going to take work and making changes. It's not a conspiracy to exclude you",

I would recommend trying clubs again at the first clubs I tried it felt like everyone knew each other and it just wasn\u2019t for me however if you just keep trying new ones every club has its own culture and vibe to it. Once I found a club that worked I immediately started making friends. I don\u2019t necessarily agree that Binghamton is cliquey but you do need to find people with things in common for a friendship to begin.

Now, let's talk about your school. From what I gather, it's a real brainy place, more focused on academia and research than sports. Hey, that's cool! Who needs a killer sports team when you've got brains, right? Your experience isn't exactly a unicorn in the academic world. Trust me, finding your squad can be a challenge, whether you're a high school student switching schools, a grad student, or even starting a new job. It happens to the best of us.\n\nSo, here's my two cents. Take a moment to ponder what truly matters to you. Are there any activities you can dive into? And hey, the real deal is whether you're gaining the skills and knowledge to kickstart your career. Everything else is just icing on the cake. The more you learn and believe in yourself, the more comfortable you become in your own skin. And guess what? That's when you'll start racking up the cherries on top of your life's sundae!

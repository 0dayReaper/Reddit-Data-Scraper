Maybe enjoy the sunny, spring weather for a change.\n\nWhat we'll actually be doing: Catch-up day for assignments and projects since people are already  overwhelmed as is. Also probably getting drunk af at night since scheduling a day off on St. Patrick's Day was a *brilliant* idea on the part of the administration. Then they'll send out another passive-aggressive email to us on how people are becoming complacent when they practically sanctioned people to party.",

My main problem with SBU is that it's very close to home, and after visiting, it feels dead on the weekends. If I get into Bing, should I transfer? Will I get on-campus housing?",

I want to get away from Long Island and my parents (I live an hour away from SBU and about 3.5 from Bing0, but I know SBU is more of a STEM school. Pls give advice or recommendations, or if anyone was in a similar situation or transferred in/out of Watson, please let me know how it went. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(They would also cost nearly the same amount of  money so financial stuff isn't an issue)",

Engg major is very desirable in the job front. Where u get your degree is not going to matter!!! \nPick what your heart leans toward. You can even try out at SBU and then transfer to bing if u don\u2019t like it there.",

That being said, no matter where you go, if you don\u2019t actively seek friends and put yourself out there it\u2019s still going to be hard to make friends, and you can make friends and have stuff to do at stony if you really want to make it work",

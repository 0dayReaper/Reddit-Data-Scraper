    "postText": "Hello. I'm an incoming freshman and I'm thinking about majoring in philosophy, but I have some questions. I know that philosophy degrees in general are not lucrative, so, with all due respect, I'm not interested in general opinions about that value of studying philosophy or how useless it is, rather, I want to know about the quality of the classes, teachers, etc. Does anyone have experience they'd be willing to share about any details of philosophy at Bing? What are the areas of specialization, how are the teachers, how's the general environment, etc.? \nThanks!",

If you are an incoming freshman, I highly recommend PHIL 146 (Law and Justice) and PHIL 149 (Environmental Ethics)\n\nIf you do want something that you can apply later on, it's pretty easy to pick a minor useful for a field you want to pursue. You can also do PPL (Politics, Philosophy, and Law)",

The classes are challenging but doable, the professors will know you by name, you have to write independent work which is a fun way to express your opinions. Some of the classes are harder than others but there are no \"weed outs\" and the professors genuinely want you there and want you to learn the material",

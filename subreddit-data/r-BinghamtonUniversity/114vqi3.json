The apartments were nice and if I ever had an issue, everyone was very open to helping me out asap! It\u2019s pretty central to everything downtown and it has the parking garage connected to the building on the 6th floor. It made driving home at night and parking in the garage less anxiety driven because of the reputation the garages have.",

When I didn't have a car, it was easy to get everywhere because both room and campus busses run often. I have always felt safe. If you like to go out, I think its perfect cause all the bars are super close.",

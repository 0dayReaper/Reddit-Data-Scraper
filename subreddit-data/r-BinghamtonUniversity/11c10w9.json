How doable is it as a part time student? What is the dissertation process like? What\u2019s the coursework like? Share anything you can/want to about the experience \ud83d\ude4f",

I'm at a point where I finished coursework, which is annoying at times but the core courses are good. \n\nWhen you say you have a non-engineering background, what is your prior education/experience? I might be able to put you in contact with someone.",

The program director, Hiroki Sayama, also runs coding/math office hours regularly throughout each semester. Those are for anyone to get help if you ever feel like there's some background knowledge you're missing.\n\nAt least in the classes I've taken, all programming has been in Python. But that should be quick to pick up with prior programming experience!",

And yes, I know systems science not at all the same as computer science @_colematt , but it appears that coding and math are a big part of this program for the sake of modeling systems.",

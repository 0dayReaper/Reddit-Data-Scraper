    "postText": "Hi, I am thinking of switching out of CS to do an Econ BA in 2 years and basically, I could either take Econ 360 and 362 in the same semester to ensure that I will be able to take all my Econ electives senior year (because 360 and 362 are prereqs for a lot of the elective) or I could spread my schedule out and hope to take Econ 360 and an Econ 300+ elective one semester and then take Econ 362 the following semester with 2 other Econ electives. I am just confused about what I should do because the advisor said that she's seen students take 360 and 362 together and essentially fail. I'd consider myself a strong student but I was just wondering what the best course of action here is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan any Econ majors offer their input? Thanks!",

Can you elaborate more on why I shouldn't take these in the same semester, or rather, if I had to is it a guaranteed death sentence? Thanks!",

I was trying to get into SOM and it just wasn\u2019t happening so I went with Econ. I\u2019m my personal experience macro was ridiculously hard but that may have also been the professor I had at the time. If you have the option to not take it with Barry Jones, DO NOT take it with him. Personally it would have been a death sentence for me if I took them both at the same time.",

Taking both the same semester is going to be tough, I took Hanes for 362 last semester and that class was miserable. I definitely would not have wanted to have to deal with 360 on top of that class.",

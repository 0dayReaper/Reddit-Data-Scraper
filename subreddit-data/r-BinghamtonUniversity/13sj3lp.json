            "comment": "\"how do i politely imply i don\u2019t want much to do with people who went to the same highschool that are going here too\"   Its a big enough place that you probably won't run into as many of them - or as often as you think.  Just make friends that aren't from town, and its fine. \n\n'on the same note, how do i gently tell my parents to give me space\" - I am assuming that you are living on campus (given your last question)  The simple answer is:  college life is busy; very busy.  Class time +homework - never mind any activities that you may have -- just because you live near by it doesn't mean you can come home daily; or swing by on the weekend.  You have to study. If they persist to the point its stressing you out, give boundraries:  hey I can only talk for 5 minutes. I can see you guys tonight, but only for an hour, because  I have exams coming up and I need to study. \n\nThere are some places on campus that you can get emergency sanitary supplies, but if you are looking for specific items, its best you plan on stocking up on your own.  There are places on campus to buy, too, but limited stock and more expensive.  Its best to make plans to buy off campus, or if living on campus without a car, get regular shipments from amazon or the like.",

            "comment": "Heyyy! Welcome to Bing. Hope I can help you as much as I can as I live in hinman and am In SOM :)\n\n1. I had 4 outlets in my double last year but if youre living in Cleveland you\u2019ll get additional outlets on your table. Regardless, bring an extension cord\u2026 trust me. \n2. You only need 1. You might wear it once a week or every other week so realistically just get different shirts that you can wear underneath. \n3. People don\u2019t care, it\u2019s more of a conversation starter to see if you guys live near eachother \n4. Since you guys are being put in such a big pool of kids now you\u2019re barley gonna ever be with them, especially if you\u2019re not dorming with them and don\u2019t make the effort. You guys are both making new friends so this will be mutual. Regardless, It\u2019s always nice to have a familiar face so I\u2019d keep them in case you didn\u2019t want to have dinner alone/just to have a friendly interaction with them once in a while. \n5. This all depends on if you\u2019re dorming. If you are, then you will both be busy so unless you guys make the effort to call it won\u2019t really happen very often. \n6. The book store might have some things, but for almost everything it\u2019s Walmart\n\nHope this all helps!!!",

            "comment": "Hi and welcome to Bing.  I have some insight into your questions.   When I went to college, I had the situation with someone from my high school. I didn\u2019t have to say anything, I was just busy and made my own friends.  \n\nCoincidentally, my son recently graduated from Bing and had the same situation.   School and other friends kept him too busy.  \n\nMore significantly, my son was also a townie and lived on campus.  Nobody cared.  Even better, he knew better places to eat and hang than the other students.  \n\nFinally, I don\u2019t know specifically what you are concerned about with your parents, but Federal law (FERPA) blocks professors from discussing your grades with your parents without your written consent.   \n\nEnjoy Bing!",

            "comment": "- don\u2019t know about hinman but in Dickinson I had 3 outlets and an Ethernet cable connector.if you have less, extension cords are also an option. For the bathroom, there is usually 1 outlet.\n- my brother is in SOM, he did fine with one black suit and blue suit with a white shirt and 3-5 ties. You can be fine with one suit if you have various ties.\n- most people are from Long Island. In my opinion nobody really cares if you are a townie. Most of the times they\u2019ll reply with \u201coh wow that\u2019s cool\u201d or somebody will want for you to show them around town \n- it\u2019s a big university, you won\u2019t be running into people you went to high school too often. If you do, you can typically blow them off by telling them you have schoolwork or whatever.\n-on the same note, you can gently tell your parents that you will be focusing a lot on school, so that you will need some space to get accommodated to the college life/college schoolwork.\n- There is  no place on campus to get sanitary products to my knowledge(I have been at Bing for 1 semester so take this lightly) but the cleaning staff does replace the toilet paper every week and the nearest Walmart is less than 5 minutes away in car.\nHope this helps!",

All the bathrooms on campus that I used did not have working machines and some didn\u2019t even have any machine. The women\u2019s bathroom don\u2019t have any supplies so make sure you buy your own. The Bookstore on campus has some but you can also buy them at Walmart, target, Wegmans or any drug store.",

The few outlets you get are not going to be enough for everything you need plugged in (lamp, chargers, fridge, etc)\n2. I am not in SOM so I can't be of any help with this one, sorry! \n3. No one really cares where you're from! Everyone makes jokes about the stereotypes of townies or Long Islanders, but that won't affect your day to day life or your relationships. You'll be fine!\n4. Binghamton is huge, and you most likely won't have to see anyone from your high school unless you want to. There are around 20 people from my year in high school at Binghamton and even more from other years, and I rarely see them unless I go out of my way to. \n5. Living on campus definitely helps since you won't be seeing them on a daily basis, but it's important to set boundaries with them. You will also be a lot busier with studying, homework, and social life, so you won't have as much time to speak to them. \n6. If you want a specific product and don't like what's provided for free on campus, Walmart/Target are probably your best bet... I don't know how many options the Bookstore has for sanitary products",

They will usually last me a little while, so I can just get them a few weeks before I will need them if I\u2019m running low. Same with everything honestly. Campus has a few hygiene products in the book store, but a very VERY limited selection for more money. If you are in a pinch, then you can buy or ask someone for aid (roommate, friend, random person in the bathroom) but it\u2019s better to just buy from a store like Walmart or target.",

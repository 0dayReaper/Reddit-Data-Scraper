    "postText": "Professor gave a quiz based off an in class documentary and many of the \"correct\" answers were not correct. If the documentary said that X is true, the correct choice for the quiz quesion was X is false. Many of us have emailed her about this and she said the grades are final on the quiz and refuses to correct her errors.\n\nIs this something I should expect to just have to deal with or should I email the department chair? It turned out to result in a sizable  impact on my grade.",

            "comment": "contact the department chair. make sure you take note of all the evidence. everything you need such as quiz grade, emails with your professor, the syllabus, proof that the answers should have been correct, proof from other students as well, etc. \n\n\nit may or may not take a while to resolve so just have everything documented cause brightspace will remove your access to that class soon",

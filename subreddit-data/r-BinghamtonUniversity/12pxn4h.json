Privately run student targeted apartment buildings around the same price as on campus options and will have better furnishings and way more space. If you find people to like with and rent a house in the area that can also be way cheaper than on campus.",

I lived in hillside (its not as bad as everyone made it seem imo) i forgot which one i lived in. i lived in one where it was only transfer so it was easier to bond when you have something in common. I think hillside is easier to live in if you have a car. I enjoyed living in susquehanna because it was closer to everything.",

There are two new buildings in hillside and those have elevators, a laundry room that you don\u2019t have to step outside for, larger space, and better regulated temperature. The other hillside buildings aren\u2019t bad either and they\u2019re a closer to the rest of campus than the two newer ones (like a 2-3 minute walk closer tho). From what I\u2019ve seen, hillside apts are slightly bigger than susq ones, but their basic layout is the same. Like the other person said, try to get on the second floor because it isn\u2019t as buggy and you won\u2019t have to worry about people stomping above you lol",

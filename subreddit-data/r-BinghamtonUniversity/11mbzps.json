            "comment": "The rooms are noticably bigger than the rooms in Hillside (at least that's the case for my room in Filmore vs my rooms in Choconut and Nanticoke). Like the other person said, the walk isn't bad at all- it took about 3-5 minutes to get from Choconut to the Classroom Wing, depending on how fast I was walking. Hinman Dining Hall is literally right there, which is pretty convenient if you don't feel like cooking.\n\nAs for cons, some apartments may have a bug problem. When I was in Choconut I had to be super wary about leaving food uncovered for too long in my room, lest it get completely swarmed by ants. I once had to learn my cooking dish wasn't totally clean yet by way of hearing ants crawling all over the handles. Not fun.  My room in Nanticoke didn't have this issue at all, though. \n\nAll in all, solid 7/10, would do it again",

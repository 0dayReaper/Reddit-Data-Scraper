In Watson, it was closer to $22K pretax per academic year as of last year, but that is before the pay raises that GSEU has been negotiating. I'm at a slightly different salary because I am a lecturer, not just a TA, so I can't give the precise figure ... but the contractual floor is $21K for the unionized fully-funded PhDs. I imagine the floor is close to that for the unionized MS TAs.",

Your program could be different than mine. \n\nThere are jobs on campus that are available for grads but they are competitive and there are more grad applying than positions available. You can go to the website and search for student jobs to find the current list of open on campus jobs but most going to be for undergrads. Also grads are limited to a totally of 29 hours a week for jobs and most of the time are only scheduled 10-20 a week but it definitely varies.",

Hope this helps.\n\n&gt; I enquired about TAship but the office said that they rarely provide TAship in first sem! \n\nCorrect. Most of the TAs are recruited by the professors themselves. This means that they usually use their positions to fund students in their lab, though there are some TAs who are hired at-large from MS students who excelled in the course. That's why it's rare for a MSCS student to get hired directly -- you haven't taken any courses yet.\n\n&gt; What are the other ways to earn money from first sem while studying?\n\nThe university posts [campus jobs](https://www.binghamton.edu/ccpd/student-employment/student/), and one applies on [HireBing](https://www.binghamton.edu/ccpd/hirebing.html). This includes positions like Sodexo food services, ITS help desk, etc. These are usually hourly campus work-study jobs.\n\nAdditionally, the CS department occasionally hires graders for a fixed stipend per semester. When these positions are available, they are usually announced to the MS student mailing list in the first couple of weeks and they are competitive. It doesn't pay a large amount of money, there's no tuition/fee scholarship, nor employment benefits (unlike the TA positions). But it beats the alternative of no income.\n\n&gt; Are TA positions \"rolled over\"?\n\nYes and no. Your appointment will cover one academic year, August to May, with paychecks coming when school is in session. If you will be staying for the following year and have performed satisfactorily, the department will often offer you an appointment before your first appointment expires (though it isn't guaranteed). Should you accept, your health insurance and union membership continues through the summer, and you remain \"employed\" even though you won't receive a paycheck when school is not in session. If you are affiliated with a lab, the PI will often place you on a GA position to keep you paid during the breaks.",

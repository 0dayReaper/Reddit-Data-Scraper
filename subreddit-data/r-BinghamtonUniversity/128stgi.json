    "postText": "I got accepted into Bing for the spring semester of 24. I\u2019m really interested in going because it\u2019s a great school and I was kinda lucky to be accepted tbh, but from when I visited once it seemed kind of bleak in Binghamton the actual city. Can any students tell me a bit more about student life and what kind of fun things there are to do outside of actual schooling?",

Partying is absolutely huge, but I haven\u2019t really done it since freshman year and there\u2019s plenty of alternative. There\u2019s some fun restaurants around, and good deals like restaurant week (20-30$ three course dinner). On campus there\u2019s a club for everything you could possibly think of. Student life is pretty good and there\u2019s always lots of events. There\u2019s movie nights and late nite which always has diff themes. There\u2019s always something to do if you look, and if you\u2019re bored during the day you can always go on a walk in the nature preserve.",

Nightlife, like the other commenter said is pretty good - a few bars, lots of parties, concerts at the Bundy Annex, etc.\n\n There's also a  ton of clubs on campus, events in your residential community, club/intramural sports, late night, and a lot more",

Like for instance there are malls in the area you can go walk around in and shop if you're interested in that. There's also a movie theater around the area and I believe an ice skating rink in SUNY Broome (Ice skating clubs tends to go there to meet) \n\nAlso, on campus, there is late night every Friday and saturday night, bowling, pool, and other club activities happening all the time. That's just a few things I'm interested in\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about Bing itself or whatnot",

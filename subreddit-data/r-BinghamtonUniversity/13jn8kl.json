He will be going there from community college so basically a 3rd year student.He just got sent a lease for UClub. I understand they don\u2019t have a great reputation. Are there any other places I should refer him to for accommodation. He has a fairly large budget if that matters.",

Not all units at ulofts have windows, you need to request for a window in your bedroom, I think having an involved parent with you when calling places help, I did it on my own and at ulofts the workers all knew me and were very helpful even though my parents werent involved.",

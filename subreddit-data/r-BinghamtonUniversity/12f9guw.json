    "postText": "How much storage do we get on our Bing Google drives while enrolled? Is it capped at 5GB? \n\nAlternatively, can someone recommend a cloud-based sync for 200GB + worth of data? Just migrated out of Dropbox and iCloud, looking for a cheaper more long-term option but thinking of stashing everything in my Bing drive until I figure out which provider to use for 10+ years going forward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "New for Fall 2023 is a new **major** housed within Harpur, [Global Public Health BA, BS, and BS for Future Healthcare Providers](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/acadprogs/harpur/global_public_health.html) (the major is currently housed within Harpur). This is an interdisciplinary major great for Pre-Health students!\n\nAlso new is an [English **minor**](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/acadprogs/harpur/english.html) open to any Binghamton student, regardless of school.\n\nSOM has announced an [Accounting **minor**](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/acadprogs/management/accounting.html) for non-SOM students, meaning students in Harpur, for example, would be eligible.\n\nFinally, [Philosophy, Politics and Law (PPL) has added three new **concentrations**](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/acadprogs/harpur/phil_pol_law.html) to its BA program, listed as the following: Political and Ethical Theory, Global and International Affairs, and Public Policy.\n\n[Music also added several **concentrations**](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/acadprogs/harpur/music.html) for students to follow, also for the BA: a Performance track, a Composition track, and a Musicology track. \n\nThe new areas of study are open to current/continuing students, just keep in mind that you should declare the major/minor/concentration with enough time to finish it by your intended graduation date.",

Public Policy is a concentration within the PPL major, not an entirely new major itself.\n\nIn terms of studying policy, there's the Master's programs for MPA (and soon, MPP) in CCPA. \n\nThe Accounting minor was probably made to limit the amount of IUT requests I'm guessing, I would assume it's easier to raise the seat count for a few Accounting classes as opposed to creating greater capacity for more SOM students overall.",

            "comment": "As a recent graduate from SOM, was the incorporation of Accounting as a minor into Harpur designed with the goal of increasing enrollment? I remember hearing a lot these past two years that the number of Accounting students in SOM has considerably shrunk, nearly half from like 2014 (I'm guessing due to factors like poor work life balance and automation endangering the profession). As someone who had to plan career events back in undergrad, I recall a lot of the accounting firm events having underwhelming attendance and people explicitly emailing me if there were any non-accounting firms recruiting. The employers that SOM get are mostly accounting firms such as the Big 4 so I wonder if this is a way to sustain the pipeline of students and maintain these connections if the number of students declaring the major is decreasing.",

I don't work with/for SOM so I can't speak on their rationale, but for all intents and purposes students with an Accounting minor would not be full-fledged SOM students, so I don't know if they would be going to the same type of SOM events/getting the same internships. \n\nFrom working with Harpur students I do know that recently it seems that many people who apply to SOM initially often don't get accepted, and then usually their IUT request is denied due to how competitive it is. \n\nSo, it may not be that there's a decreased interest in Accounting, it just might be that some of the students interested in pursuing Accounting aren't up to the caliber SOM is looking for. But honestly, I've been getting more people looking for Business Administration anyway, not Accounting.",

    "postText": "\nHello, I'm an incoming freshman to college next year and I'm having serious trouble in deciding if I made a good decision. I'm an economics major, however to be competitive in economics you need to have pretty much your PhD. I'm in between Baruch College &amp; Binghamton University. I already committed to Baruch as it is in the city and can give year-round internships, however to really break through in the field of economics you need research, which Baruch does not have much of. On the flip side, there is Binghamton where it has greater rankings on economics, but it is incredibly far from home and in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing said about research when I went to college tour there unless it had to do with engineering.  I also find the best paying economics majors come from crazy prestigious schools, but the average income for those are still less than 100K. Heck, both average income after college for these two are around 44K. Should I be confident in my commitment? Or should I change it? What should I do? I heard a lot of crap about the economics department from both schools. Do you think I have a better chance at becoming successful (i.e. dat good money) at Binghamton? Do you think it would offer me a better education? Is there research? Is it helpful? I have a class called AP Research under my belt where I pretty much created my own research study, do you think that is helpful or valuable in any way?\n\nWhy is college so complicated...",

            "comment": "If the internship options are better at Baruch for you this sounds like the right choice however I feel like a year round internship may not be as necessary as you think. A summer internship with strong extracurriculars during the school year should also be good on the resume. Overall don\u2019t stress too much Econ is a great major and I see interesting jobs looking all the time. Especially for jobs in wealth management or data analytics. If you really do feel like the major won\u2019t take you where you want to be you haven\u2019t even started college yet so you have plenty of time to change it. Majoring in accounting, finance/business admin with a concentration in finance, math, cs, data analytics could all be good options maybe just take a moment to really think about why you chose that major and what you hope it\u2019ll do for you and if your goals are better suited to another degree. Hope this helps \ud83d\ude0a.",

And like everything else, college is very much what you make it to be - at Binghamton you can find research opportunites even when they are not handed to you.       \n\nStop second guessing yourself, try a year at the place you are committed.  Maybe you end up not liking there and you decide to tansfer for your sophmore year.   But just go and give it a chance. \n\nBut...honestly you have plans to go to Baruch.  Go there. If you don't like it, then try a transfer in your sophmore year.",

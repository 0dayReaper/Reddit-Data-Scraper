    "postText": "Hey! I've been DMing a DnD game for a bit now and one of our members needed to leave the group due to some scheduling issues so I'm looking for 1-2 people to join our group to round out the party. It's a dnd 5e game and we're all super chill and it's not like a super serious game or anything, we're all just having fun. only 1 out of our group had ever played dnd before joining us so if you need help making a character or learning the game I'd be more than happy to help. Let me know if you're interested in joining! We're looking to run on Saturdays starting somewhere between 5 and 6pm and we typically go for like 3 hours. We reserve a room in Bartle library so that's where we meet. Next week though and I think another week after break we can start earlier than 5pm though so we can be a little flexible.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I am interested in software engineering? I didn't get into the computer science program but i did get into computer engineering? I was wondering if anyone is in the major? Is it possible to gear the major towards a career in software engineering. Looking at the bulletin, i see that there are 4 programming classes with the remaining being electrical classes. Any thoughts from students in the major would be helpful. Thanks",

            "comment": "Computer engineering is mostly programming, even though that might not be evident in the title of every class that involves it. Computer engineering is focused on digital hardware (how logic gates are assembled to make useful stuff) and programming for very direct control of digital hardware. It will qualify you for some types of software engineering (C, embedded systems, FPGA stuff) but it won\u2019t involve high-level/object oriented stuff that is needed for many software jobs. It\u2019s more about the software needed for things like  communication systems and robotics than the software needed for things like web services.",

I decided to do software engineering halfway thru my Coe degree so I thought just finishing that so I have a related degree would be good plus I have a machine learning, python, Java, and intro to algorithms microcredential certifications that I put on my LinkedIn and heavily geared all my projects to focus more on the software side of things + some personal unity project bc I wanna end up in the video game industry. \n\nMind you, I have a dogshit GPA (major and cumulative) but if you grind all the extra stuff and advertise yourself properly you can get there no prob",

Happens all the time. You\u2019ll have very good fundamentals for a SE role.\n\nIf you work hard and get good grades you can do a IUT transfer to the CS department. Talk to advising. Or even transfer to a different school after a year or two.",

Though if you think you might like AI or Web Development for example, you may want to try switching to majoring in CS since you really like software. As someone who liked the software way more than hardware, i wish i did that! Though even if you stick with Computer Engineering which is still good, it\u2019ll be super helpful if you apply to a lot of software engineering internships your sophomore and junior year! I also know plenty of CoE alumni who got software engineering jobs right after graduating, and I even have a software engineering internship this summer, so it is possible. Good luck to you!! :D",

            "comment": "One thing you\u2019re tangentially hearing from other people that you should definitely take note of is that software engineering is a very wide field. You\u2019ve got CE grads doing embedded systems software engineering who would be less qualified for front end database or AI programming, and you\u2019ve got CS grads who could do the opposite. And then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find CE grads who understand enough about algorithms and design patterns and math to do AI, and you definitely have CS grads working very close to the metal because that\u2019s where I am.\n\nYou can take classes in any of CS/CE/EE that will get you specific types of software engineering jobs, but it is unlikely that your undergraduate will be enough to get you through a 40 year career. You have to evolve through self study no matter what your major was.",

Btw: anyone who traces their ancestry to the Caribbean  is considered West Indies. \n\nAlso, coming from Guyana and actually growing up there, creating a club specific to indo Guyanese severely clashes with the actual culture of Guyana where everyone mixes with everyone despite there being racial tensions between afro and indo Guyanese\n\nIdk about how other indo Caribbean populations socialise in other Caribbean countries  but you said you were Guyanese in the comments",

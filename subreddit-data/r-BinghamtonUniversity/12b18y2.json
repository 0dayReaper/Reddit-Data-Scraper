    "postText": "So I've been accepted into Bing and it's currently my top school. I haven't received any merit aid, but I've heard that students usually get scholarships during their spring semester. Is this how scholarships work at Bing and what are my chances of receiving one? I really want to go to Bing, but my parents are pushing me toward UB since it will be more affordable (scholarships and living at home). If anyone could drop some advice it would be appreciated &lt;3",

For excelsior I believe your family needs a combined income under $120,000 this might have changed though. I will be honest though you probably will not beat the savings of living at home because any program that gives you aid for Bing will also apply to UB. Both are really great schools though so you should be very proud of yourself either way.",

It is literally the only school (that accepted him) that didn\u2019t offer my son $ (for reference: pitt 10k, UB 4.5k, stony 3k, Syracuse 25k, u of R 9k, bing a big fat zero)- he was rejected from Cornell and Princeton and those were all his results. Didn\u2019t apply a ton of places. \nI\u2019m told Bing doesn\u2019t give a lot of $ to instate kids. So you might not get any merit $. And for what it\u2019s worth, UB is just as good and cheaper if you got a scholarship, so don\u2019t rule it out. Maybe you could live on campus at UB.",

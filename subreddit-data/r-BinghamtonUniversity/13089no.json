    "postText": "I've committed to Binghamton's BAP program and am now looking at options for housing. While Dickinson and Newing are my best options right now, I was wondering about the differences between living with or without these kinds of programs (specifically the LGBTQ+ one). I know it's brand new, but would it be worth it? Should I live in Newing for the LGBTQ+ living community or go to Dickinson instead? And would there be gender inclusive housing at Dickinson available?",

            "comment": "Every living community has gender-inclusive housing, so that's not a concern, but I've found that if you have a bad spot in the housing process, GIH rooms may be few and far between. The new LGBTQ+ dorm (iirc) is freshman-only, so you shouldn't have any concerns with housing filling up too quick. As far as my opinion goes, I think the LGBTQ+ dorm probably will be a \"safer\" space to exist in, but I sincerely doubt that you'd experience hate in any living community, as a bi person I've felt like Binghamton as a whole is very accepting. Regardless of what housing you choose, I'd recommend choosing a roommate that you think would be a good fit for you, rather than leaving it to chance. If you have any questions feel free to let me know, and good luck moving forward!",

I\u2019m not trying to go dumpster diving but I wouldn\u2019t mind taking second hand tables, chairs, or wall decorations.",

It's a huge furniture consignment shop that constantly has stuff coming in. I've gotten a bunch of things for my apartment from there.\n\nJust be aware that some upholstered things might not pass fire inspection if you're living in on-campus dorms. I would heed this warning wherever you look.",

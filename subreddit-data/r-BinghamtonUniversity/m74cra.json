    "postText": "Yesterday I went to the marketplace with a couple friends and saw the milkshake place for the first time. Naturally, I was quite intrigued. However, not a soul was in line to buy one of their delicious ice cream treats, which we collectively found to be odd. After getting a beautifully crafted sandwich from the wonderful sandwich artists over at Boar's Head, some sort of irresistible gravitational force lured me over to the milkshake station. Once there, all I could do was order a Cookies 'n Cream shake. Much to my surprise, despite having no other customers, quite a lengthy wait ensued. It seemed as though these talented shakers were attempting to bring life to Frankenstein due to the vigor with which they worked. But the true horror was yet to come. As my milkshake was handed me, I quickly realized the predicament I had gotten myself into. This was no ordinary milkshake, This was not the sort of milkshake that has the potential to pass for a smoothie or coffee. I was handed the King of the Shakes. A shake that made all other shakes quiver in fear. About 1 foot in height, not including the mountain of whipped cream sitting atop it, it looked like a delicious Empire State Building with an Oreo lightning rod. The tremendous shake made me feel small. I must have looked like a 5-year old eating a Mickey Mouse ice cream bar whilst touring Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom. Yet, this was far from true. I was a 19-year old college freshman in Vestal, New York, in the wonderland that is Binghamton's Marketplace. And there I sat, in front of this monstrosity, bringing shame to all who knew me. I have yet to hear from my family and friends since the incident. Even my suite mates have moved out.\n\nInjustices such as this cannot continue. Hershey's Milkshakes should be brought up on war crimes and human rights violations for acts they committed on the 16th of March. This level of embarrassment is certainly frowned upon by the Geneva Convention. To President Stenger, Governor Cuomo, President Biden, and yes even G--d himself, I beg you to bring swift justice against this cruel institution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s. The milkshake was fucking phenomenal ... highly recommend",

I am glad to hear that you managed to escape from its tantalizing jaws. But know that it will only let you escape once, if you so dare return to its domain please be wary and prepared. I wish you the best in your future endeavors and ride strong in the name of Stenger.\n\nSincerely a watchful follower,\n\nSerVro",

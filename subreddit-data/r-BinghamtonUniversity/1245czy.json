They tend to surround one of his focuses, i.e. detecting toxicity/hate speech/racism/cheating, which is a fairly difficult and not well defined NLP problem. This is one of the few courses that actually warrants the \"trigger warning\" as much of the content is derived by flavorful communities like 4Chan..\n\nSnoop their [Google Scholars page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W_ApnIUAAAAJ), and you are more likely than not going to see a paper referenced in-class.\n\nFor the actual course work, it was three projects to form a data pipeline from scratch; project 1 to collect the data, project 2 to analyze it, project 3 to visualize it; they are all using the same dataset that you generated, each has their their own proposal and report associated with it. A significant portion of this will be \"self-taught\" and aided during office hours, don't expect any direct in-class coding instruction on how to overcome the challenges associated with this. When I took it, you needed to pull from Reddit, Twitter, and any other platform- thank's to Elon that's definitely going to change in future semesters.",

Internship programs seemingly have been spared a bit from these freezes.\n\nThe solution? Referrals, referrals, referrals. Build out your network (attend HackBU/ACM, on-campus alumni events), and [keep up on your leetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) in the meantime.",

If you want a surefire way to boost grades next time: office hours. Office hours are, at least in my experience, the most beneficial way to get help in classes and to get a better reputation with your professors. If you\u2019re a 1st or 2nd year then tutoring should be available for most of your classes, but still utilize office hours.",

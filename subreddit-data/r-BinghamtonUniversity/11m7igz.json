    "postText": "hi, i\u2019m a community college transfer planning to attend binghamton this fall. i figured that getting a head start this summer with some major-specific classes my CC doesn\u2019t offer wouldn\u2019t hurt. however, two online classes i\u2019d like to take, PSYC 327 and PSYC 243, both have a slot for class monday-friday and TBA. i know this sounds like a really dumb question, but are there actually meetings 5 days a week? it\u2019s doable for me, but there was a job i was hoping to work this summer and it wouldn\u2019t work if i had to meet every morning 5x a week.",

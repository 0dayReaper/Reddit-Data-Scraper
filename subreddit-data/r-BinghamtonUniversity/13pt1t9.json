You can check if it transfers here: [https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/coursework.html](https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/coursework.html)",

                    "comment": "^ Seconded. Calc I and II here are divided into two \"paired\" courses each, meaning you cannot register for one half without the other. Both courses are two credits each and run for half a semester each, but since you need them together it creates one four credit, semester-long course. Calc I is MATH 224/225 and Calc II is MATH 226/227 (and Calc III is just one course, MATH 323). \n\nThe department made this split because a lot of people were failing or doing poorly in Calc and it would tank their GPAs because a four credit course has more effect on GPA than a two credit course, so for example, you could get a B in MATH 224 but a B+ in MATH 225, for instance, instead of just one B- if it was a singular course.\n\nCheck the link provided above to see what course(s) you'll get credit for when you transfer the credit over.",

Your Calc 2 will likely give you credit up to 227 but it's always good to double check.",

            "comment": "226 is the first half of calc2 and 227 is the second half. Each are 2 credits. I think the reason they do that is because for certain ap calc scores, they will only accept credit for half of calc 2, so many students end up just taking 227",

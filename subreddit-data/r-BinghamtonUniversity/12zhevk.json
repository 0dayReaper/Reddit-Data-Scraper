    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on attending Bing in the fall as a political science major. Looking online I saw a variety of opinions of what my class schedule should look like for freshmen year. I want to make sure I\u2019m not wasting my time with any of the classes I take freshmen year and get what I need to out of the way. So I was just wondering what classes are deemed essential for poli sci freshmen and what a good class load would look like?",

            "comment": "You\u2019ll want to take an introductory level poli sci course. Those are American Politics (PLSC 111), Comparative Politics (PLSC 113), Political Theory (PLSC 115), and International Politics (PLSC 117). It doesn\u2019t matter what order you do them in.\n\nIn addition to that, I\u2019d recommend taking another social science elective. The poli sci degree requires you take several other social science subjects. History, Geography, Anthropology, and Sociology all count toward that requirement.\n\nAlso don\u2019t forget about your Gen Eds. You\u2019ll definitely want to get those out of the way early on. Gen Eds can be your other two classes.",

A good framework is to take two introductory courses for your prospective major (any of the ones mentioned above should be fine) a writing class (WRIT 111 is ideal), and a gen Ed. Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns.",

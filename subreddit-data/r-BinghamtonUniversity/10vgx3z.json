Anyone who applied to EOP get accepted or has determined they are financially eligible yet? I already got in as an EOP for UBuffalo btw.",

For SBU, there are 7,000+ EOP applicants a year and they can only accept up to 200 freshman due to limited funding.  I\u2019m sure this also applies to Binghamton as well since they are a very popular SUNY school. I\u2019m sure Bing hasn\u2019t sent out all their decisions yet though since EOP decisions are different from the regular pool. Even though I too haven\u2019t got a decision from them yet, I\u2019m sure there are still seats available.",

    "postText": "I was planning to move out of my dorm on May 12 (friday) maybe around noon-3pm but when i checked the academic calendar, it says the residence halls will be closing 10am on May 12 for non seniors. I cant leave on thursday because I have a late final. Would I still be able to stay in my dorm past 10 am and leave my dorm after the closing time?",

And for the ease for my parents, it would be easier if i leave around may 12 noon. So i was just wondering if i would get penalized for staying past 10am",

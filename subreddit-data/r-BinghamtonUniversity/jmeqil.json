Just a few movies, baking a couple of Halloween themed treats and eating Chinese food, all while we sat 6 feet away from each other and sang (quite poorly) to the Frozen 2 soundtrack. It wasn't that hard to have a socially distanced Halloween. \n\nPlus, we need to cooperate, especially considering we have to get retested before we leave for Thanksgiving. If the spread gets worse and causes us to stay on campus for 10 days, I'm honestly going to be furious.",

People were saying it is OKAY as long as people follow the 6 feet rule and mask. Now you guys are saying we can't go outside at all even if we follow the guidelines? If I am mistaking your message please feel free to correct me. Just trying to get a better understanding of this regulation.",

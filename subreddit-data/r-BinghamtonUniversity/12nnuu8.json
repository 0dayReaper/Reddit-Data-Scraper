I am highly interested in transferring to the business school to pursue the 4 + 1 in business administration with a concentration in Quantitive Finance. Also, is anyone in here a part of the 4 + 1 program with a Quant concentration and can give me some insight into the rigor of the classes and program overall?",

            "comment": "I would say it's somewhat difficult depending on your grades. AFAIK they prioritize GPA over anything else, as well as having high grades in the prerequisite courses (Calc I or statistics, microeconomics and macroeconomics). \n\nNot that the other poster is wrong, but imo it is harder than you think to get all As, especially because Calc and stats here are not the greatest and are difficult from what I've heard. SOM also has a limited number of seats so this prevents them from letting a lot of people transfer. \n\nIUTs are not guaranteed, so I recommend doing the best you can and to also consider potential backup majors if you don't transfer in down the line. Take the prereq courses if you don't have them already and supplement them with easy gen eds to boost your GPA.",

Make sure you take some of the prereq classes that SOM has on their site and you\u2019ll probably get in",

I just followed what the website said I think you need a 3.7 GPA or higher as well as an A or B in the prerequisites of statistics calculus micro and macroeconomics. I had macro and statistics credits from high school APs so I only had to take calc and micro and I got an A in both, and I already had a 3.9 GPA while applying, so those were my stats and I got in",

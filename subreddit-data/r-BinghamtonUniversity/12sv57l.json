Your daughter might have better luck finding someone on a Binghamton FB page  related to housing or for her year. She will likely have to find a replacement in order to get Uclub to let her get out of the lease and then the new person will have to sign with Uclub. Sub-letting at a cheaper price than what your daughter signed was not allowed when I was there.",

She really liked living there, she is just going into her senior year and would like to move to downtown Binghamton instead. Thanks for your comment. I will try the FB page as well!",

Club lease that we already signed, but she now has 2 signed leases for the same time frame. She thought that U. Club was in high demand and it won't be difficult to re-let to someone. Here's hoping that we find someone. Good luck to you. :)",

In emergency use, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have had no reactions more severe than anaphylaxis (a risk of any food or drug), and the Johnson and Johnson reactions that made the news were one in a million, and now that we know it's a rare side effect in young women, detectable and treatable.\n\nThe mandate doesn't come into effect until there is a vaccine with full FDA authorization. \n\nAs for mandatory: SUNY has required MMR for decades, and even more vaccinations are required to attend daycare through the end of high school.",

I agree that J&amp;J should face relevant fines, but even then it was less than a 1 in a million chance of having an issue. Not to mention that now since so many antivaxxers exist you can essentially choose which you get.\n\n&gt; Nobody knows the long term side effects of these vaccines...The long term side effects are the key issue here that is never being addressed.\n\nYou do know that the actual theory behind making the vaccine was essentially immediate, right? Most of that time spent over the past year was in manufacturing, testing, distribution. If you want to scream \"muh long term effects\", you have to think about what \"long term effects\" are even *possible*. By I want to say June/July, the chance of any long term effects occurring that are possible, is near 0. Not to mention it would be better than, you know, the long term effects of Covid on your damned lungs!?\n\n&gt; You also have to wonder why, in a pandemic apparently so deadly, that people have to be forced to take a vaccine. You\u2019d think everyone would be rushing to take it.\n\nWell there's two reasons.\n\n* antivaxxers like you, be ashamed of yourself.\n\n* there's hesitation from African american communities because of history of using them for experimentation (ex Tuskegee).",

I'm saying that there is political pressure to grant vaccines approval regardless of whether they are safe. As long as politicians benefit, and corporations make money, the FDA will grant approval. Biden, as well as many other politicians, want to take credit for ending the pandemic to get easy votes. If they approve a faulty vaccine that gives them short term votes, they'll do that every time because they can hide behind plausible deniability and blame it on the corporations. \n\n2. According to the CDC, they stopped distribution of J&amp;J vaccines from 6 blood clots out of millions of doses. Stop yourself for a moment and think about that. Does that make any sense? Or could there be another reason why they had to temporarily pull those? I'm not saying I know the reason, but all I know is that the threshold for pulling a life saving vaccine from the markets isn't a few blood clots out of millions of shots. That action was enough to warrant suspicion alone. \n3. When I say long term effects, I don't mean a few months. I mean years down the line. Corporations hide things in their products all the time that end up causing issues later in life. J&amp;J hid the fact that asebstos was in their baby powder, which led to an increased risk of cancer for babies who used that powder during their lifetime. Long terms effects isn't feeling a little ill for a few months. I'm talking about serious, life threatening conditions that take time to manifest. \n\nAlso, the long term effects covid has is once again, practically non existent in college students. College students don't have a high enough rate of severe symptoms to have long term damage done to their bodies. The vast, vast majority of college students (99%+) get covid and come out just fine. \n\nI don't really know what the \"theory\" behind the vaccine has to do with things. J&amp;J knew how to make baby powder. I can't imagine that its that hard to manufacture. They still cut corners and it ended with innocent babies being exposed to harmful chemicals because of corporate greed. I'm not an anti-corporate type by any means. However, I acknowledge that there's a long history of corporations cutting corners and deceiving regulators when it comes to selling products where the stakes are high. \n\n4. I'm not an anti vaxxer. I think there are situations where its perfectly reasonable to get the covid vaccine. For example, there is no reason to worry about the long term effects of a vaccine when the alternative is risking getting covid which has a high likelihood of damaging you/killing you if you are in the wrong group. I think it would be irrational to not get a covid vaccine if you're 80 years old, have severe asthma, or have serious underlying conditions, for example. I don't think its rational to risk injecting a substance into your body that you don't know the long term effects of over a disease that will be a flu at worst. \n\nThe fact that you're reducing \"vaccine hesitancy\" to mostly just anti vaxxers shows how out of touch the average college student is with the relationship between non-liberal communities and government institutions. You don't have to be experimented on without your knowledge to have a justifiable reason to not trust the government. If anything, the Tuskegee experiments are a good reason for everyone to not trust the government, not just black people.",

Vaccines produce an immune response against a disease. When that disease enters your body, the vaccine prepped your body on how to kill it, making you immune for a certain duration. If you have the vaccine, you are immune. If you don\u2019t want covid, get the vaccine.

But there are reliable methods for knowing when it is or isn't valid to safely extrapolate  to a larger population with a high degree of confidence. In the case of the vaccines, you can read the efficacy and safety data and see that the probability of severe reaction is infinitesimal while the expected benefits are huge. You don't even need it take my word for it. The nice thing about math is that it doesn't care who is doing the calculation. You are free to look at the raw data, learn  the relevant statistics needed to interpret it and crunch the numbers yourself. Ironically you are complaining about extrapolating from limited data to situations where the data doesn't apply. While in fact it is your \"dumb downed\" example which does not extend to the non dumb downed statistics and data at hand.",

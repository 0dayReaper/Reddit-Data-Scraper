    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm currently a BSW student and I've been searching around for colleges that offer the MSW program. Binghamton University has been a dream of mine since high school but unfortunately, life had other plans. Anyways, how is the social work program here? What are the professors like? What is the school like?",

            "comment": "Binghamton University\u2019s MSW program is a good cheaper option than NYU or Columbia. Most of the professors are really nice and knowledgeable. My favorite would definitely be Jackie McGinley. I have her this semester and I had her last spring. She got us all a care package gift last spring to thank us for letting her teach us. She really cares about students. The classes themselves are not extremely hard. The first semester, you may have professors that try to grade harshly because it\u2019s a grad program but as long as you submit assignments on time and proof read them, you should get a good grade. You are a BSW student already so you would be an advanced standing student in the MSW program (2 semester and then you graduate with your MSW). \n\nThe field office (you are required to do an field internship) is a bit of a mess though. Someone who worked in the office just left this semester and the office has not really bounced back. They have a lot of issues with having enough field placements and some people in the office will tell you one thing and other people will tell you another thing which can get pretty confusing. \n\nIf you decide to come to Binghamton, there are apartments right next to the downtown center (where your classes would be). They are pretty expensive for this area though. Student housing is not hard to find. \n\nIf you want to talk further or have any other questions, please let me know! \nI would be happy to answer anything else about Bing\u2019s program or applying to other programs.",

I just wanted to get as much information as possible about their msw program before applying. I'm a first-generation student with imposter syndrome so I feel like my chances of getting accepted are slim. However, it's worth a try. \n\nI won't have to stay in the binghamton area because I live about an hour away. I'm a non-traditional student and on top of that, I'm 30 years old \ud83e\udd74\n\nThis was all very helpful and has made me even more excited to go ahead and apply when the time comes. Thanks again!",

I love having them in class because of the experience they bring that I might not necessarily have (I am 23). MSW programs (especially Bing) take a more holistic approach when looking at applications so they aren\u2019t just looking at grades. They look at the essay you send in and there is a group interview as well. Good luck! I hope you get in :)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to register for fall 2023 and it keeps telling me I can\u2019t register for acct 555 because I need to be enrolled in grad management. I\u2019m senior 2 standing and as far as I know anyone in SOM can take acct 555 to fulfill an undergrad req ? Idk if I\u2019m missing something. I tried to go to advising on Friday but no one was there I think bc spring break and they haven\u2019t emailed me back either. Should I email the prof?",

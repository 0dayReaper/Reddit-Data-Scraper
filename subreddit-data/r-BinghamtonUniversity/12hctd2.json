Or a much less competitive company in a smaller area (small engineering firms, defense contractor, pretty much any software company not in a big city)? If you want one of those extremely competitive positions, Cornell\u2019s reputation will give you a better chance than Bing. If you think you\u2019ll probably work at a less competitive company, Bing will save you a ton of money and get you where you need to be. All depends on what your goals are after college. Both have excellent programs, but Cornell\u2019s reputation comes with a premium cost",

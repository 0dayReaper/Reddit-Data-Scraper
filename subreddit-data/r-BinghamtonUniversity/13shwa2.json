    "postText": "Greetings, everyone! I'm seeking assistance locating a dedicated course for Math 227 portion of Calculus 2. Despite my efforts in researching various colleges, I have been unable to find any institutions that offer Math 227 as an independent course. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide recommendations or suggestions for institutions where I can solely focus on Math 227 without having to take Math 226 alongside it. Thank you kindly for your help!",

Thing is the universitys courses are worth more credits, which seems to be a bit of a problem\n\nEdit: issue with the wording. By extra i mean wil it go over over the 120 credits you take in college. I don't want to have to pay extra money for more credits",

There may be overlap between ENVI and DIDA (Statistics, for instance), you'll have to check the DIDA website to see eligible courses that count towards the minor. \n\nTypically a certain number of classes you take for the minor must be unique to the minor, so you may need an extra course or two. This is highly situational and varies student to student so you should speak to an advisor on it.",

Your major will make up most of it, then the minor and gen eds will also help contribute to it. So you will have to take more classes than just your major courses. \n\nA major is typically 12 courses (this varies, ENVI majors are typically 13), and minors are typically 6-7 classes, so you'd be looking at 13 major course + 6 SPAN minor courses (or more/less) and then 7 DIDA minor courses, plus gen eds. This varies because some major and minor req. can overlap, and this does also not include gen eds or writing courses.\n\nYou will not get charged extra for going over the 126.",

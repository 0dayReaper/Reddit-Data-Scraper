What\u2019s the workload like? Does it require coding knowledge, as I have decided to take it with HARP 150 instead of after it? If anyone knows anything about this class or has materials like the syllabus, please let me know.",

            "comment": "DIDA 325 doesn't require students to come in with any coding knowledge. There's no expectation that you've taken HARP 150. At the moment, DIDA 325 is taught in R and HARP 150 in Python, so they're not even the same programming language.\n\nThe workload is a few tests, a few assignments, and a final project, but the specifics vary from section to section of the course.\n\nSource: I run the Digital &amp; Data Studies program.",

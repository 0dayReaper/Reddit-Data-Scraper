Typically the best approach would be to maybe ask for extra credit, or to ask about the grade(s) of individual assignments, because those they *may* be willing to help you out a bit on, depending. \n\nBut generally I think emails like these would probably not be received well. If they round up your grade, they would also have to do it for everyone else to remain fair. There may also be a curve at the end of everything, so you just don't know how the prof. may approach things. IMO I wouldn't send the email, but it is up to you. In the future going forward, you can ask for an extension if you feel like external circumstances are preventing you from doing well on an assignment, and this can help your grade in the long-run.",

During my job hunt I was never once asked about my GPA, but instead I was asked a ton about my extracurriculars which ultimately got me my job. Employers care far more about drive and experience than classroom grades. I'm in engineering so being able to talk about situations where I actually designed, manufactured, and tested parts was much more valuable than my lack luster ability to calculate fluid flow in a pipe. As long as your GPA isnt dismal and you play to your strengths while acknowledging your weaknesses, I promise you'll be fine.",

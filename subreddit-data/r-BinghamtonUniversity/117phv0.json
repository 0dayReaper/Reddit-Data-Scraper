The cost difference over 4 years is about $30,000-$40,000 depending on the school.  When considering career opportunities and earnings, do you think Binghamton is worth the extra cost?",

Albany and Binghamton are much, much bigger schools than the other two, with more faculty and more generally going on. Binghamton has the strongest undergraduate student body, and generally the highest-quality programs across the board (relevant in case your daughter decides to switch majors). So, she'll probably get a better classroom education day to day at Binghamton, and will have classmates who are academically more serious and stronger. Will that affect her career opportunities and earnings? Hard to say. Maybe, maybe not.",

    "postText": "Incoming freshman. I tried selecting my dorm today and the only option I was left with was CIW Onieda. I signed up for housing in the second week of April and listed mountainview as my top priority. I had little idea of how the housing selection works because I'm an international student. \n\nIs there any possibility I can change my dorm to mountainview or Hinman? How do I do it? \n\nThanks",

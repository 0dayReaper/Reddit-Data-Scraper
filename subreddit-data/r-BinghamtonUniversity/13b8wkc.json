    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming 2023 freshman, and would love to dive straight into research and working with faculty first year. Many of my friends were invited into FRI, however I was not. I was wondering if this would impact research at Binghamton a lot, and if there is any other way to get in. Thanks!",

Just so you know\u2014 there are two streams that are for Watson only students (Image + Acoustics &amp; Clean Energy) I love my FRI stream and my project so please do not hesitate to ask me any questions if you have :) I can only speak of the one I was in though (Image and Acoustics) my friend who wasn't invited got into the Biogeochemistry stream, but I had friends in  Molecular Anthro and Neuroscience they enjoyed it a lot",

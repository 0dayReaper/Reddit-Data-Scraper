(i'm going to use the term \"they\" so i stay the most anonymous) but me and them moved in the same day and we were off to a good start. same interests,similar schedules, etc, so i thought this was going to go great. as time went on i realized their shower caddy had not moved an inch, and my roomate's smell was reflecting that. after about a week and a half i could begin to smell their odor across the room from my own bed. it got so bad to a point where i bought wall plugins to help with the smell, but nothing helped. by week three i would literally gag as i entered the room and so i decided it was time for a room change. i did it all while they were in class and never talked to them again!",

She didn't. I wasn't able to do chores or homework because of the constant migraine, wasn't even helped by prescription grade migraine meds. Talked to her again, she complained about me not doing chores (I still took out the trash and cleaned up after myself). Refused to remove the diffusers. Talked to her again, it had been a month. She threatened to go to the RA because I wasn't helping enough. We went to the RA and I mentioned the diffusers, she refused to remove them. Happened the whole semester until I moved out. I offered to replace them with wax melts or natural oil diffusers and she said she would do it. Thought she removed them but she just put them on top of the fridge (I'm 4'11\") and I thought the migraines were unrelated. Found out when I moved out and heavily thought about suing for assault and knowing bodily harm.\n\nTldr; roommate used diffusers that gave me migraines the whole semester and refused to stop after me, RA and RD asking her to stop",

A few months later she threatened to kill me and posted some absolutely vile shit on Twitter. I reported it to the RA who promptly printed it off and brought it to the RD who called the cops. The cops came to our room at 1am to tell her she needed to leave and wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to me or contact me in anyway anymore. They moved her to a dorm on the other side of campus in a single. It was then my fault that she\u2019d eventually have to explain to her parents why she was in a different room/building when they came to help her move out.",

Then during finals week the morning of my bio final he locked me out of the suite to hookup with a tinder girl after arguing w me and screaming from the top of his lungs. Ended up having to take that final off 3 hours of sleep and failing it. Then my sophomore year i had this older guy who would never clean anything and spent all day playing games on his computer. His side of the room was just filled with clothes and food with mold on it. Dorming in bing has been some of the worst experiences of my life.",

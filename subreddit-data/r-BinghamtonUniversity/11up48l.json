    "postText": "My son is a sophomore in a PA HS looking into the neuroscience program at Binghamton.  He also wants to play lacrosse.  I don\u2019t think he will qualify for financial aid.  Are there any substantial scholarships for prospective students? His grades are excellent (4.3+) with clubs and a job on his resume in addition to playing lacrosse year round for school and travel. \nTIA!",

Admissions offers a number of merit scholarships which students are automatically considered for when they apply. I\u2019d definitely suggest reaching out to the PA admissions counselor and have a discussion about what what your son could potentially qualify for\u2026it looks different from student to student",

Unless you\u2019re living in Cleveland hall in hinman (renovated and freshman only) everything in hinman is wildly outdated. No AC, no overhead lighting and one bathroom for six people.  Hinman might be a 2 minute walk from the lecture hall, but that 2 minute walk comes with more drawbacks, making it not worth it. Dickinson is going to cost you a little bit more, however, the luxuries you\u2019re getting out of it makes it much more worth it than you\u2019d think. 2 bathrooms for 4-5 people, AC, larger rooms, etc.  hinman might be more community friendly and spirited, but you will find your people in Dickinson with that same spirit, they just might be fewer. As someone who isn\u2019t in the PSLC, I can\u2019t inform you on how it is, but I hear many great things.",

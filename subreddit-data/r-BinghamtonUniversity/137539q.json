    "postText": "Hello, I'm seeking to transfer next year. I was wondering if there's any way I can take bio115 to transfer credits for bio sem 1 and 2 since I've taken 113 and 114 but couldn't fit 115 into my schedule. Is it offered in the winter? the summer? is there any cuny's that would supplement this lab credit.",

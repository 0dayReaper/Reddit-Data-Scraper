    "postText": "Hi everyone. I applied for IUT for the fall 2023 semester. I was wondering if anyone has or knows of anyone who has successfully IUT for biomedical engineering. I know it\u2019s super competitive for computer science, but is it the same for BME? I fulfilled all the other class requirements besides PHYS 131 and I\u2019m trying to decide if I should take physics during the summer, or if it\u2019s not worth it if my chances are really slim. Thanks in advance!",

I\u2019m pretty sure anyone who isn\u2019t accepted right after graduating highschool has to submit an IUT though, since they only accept them in the spring for the following fall",

What are my first steps/ what do I need to do? I have all the course requirements completed. Any help would be greatly appreciated :))!!",

I know Harpur Advising is and they do Pre-Health as well (but really mostly for Freshmen/Sophomores), so if you can't meet with Dr. Langhorne you could maybe try to see if a Harpur Advisor could talk to you about next steps. \n\nYou may just have to reach out to the Pre-Health office and ask for availability. It looks like you also may have to declare a Pre-Health area of interest before you can schedule, based on what's on their website. I suggest maybe filling out the form so you can be added to the listserv and have the interest area formally declared - this may make you eligible for appointment scheduling: https://my.binghamton.edu/community/main/preprofessionalareasofint .\n\nI'll include more info here copy and pasted from their website, but it looks like they also meet with alumni too, so their services will also be available upon graduation.\n\n\"To Submit a Pre-Professional Area of Interest:\nSubmit the brief form online. Once submitted, it will take 3-5 business days for you to be added to B-Successful for online scheduling access. Anyone who declares their Pre-Professional Area of Interest should automatically be subscribed to the Pre-Health listserv within 3-5 business days.\"\n\nThe appointment scheduling software for the university changed a few months ago so some things are a little weird now, I suggest reading the Pre-Health website as it gives you more info in-depth about how to go about making an appointment now with the current system: https://www.binghamton.edu/pre-health/about/appointments.html",

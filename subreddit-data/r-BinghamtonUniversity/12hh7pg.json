    "postText": "I'm planning on doing Econ and CS double majors. I know there are too many variables herebhu what is a reasonable pay someone with either of these degrees expect after first year of graduation? \n\nI'm an international student and my parents want to pay all the costs for all four years cause they don't want me to take the debt burden. However, I want to take some loans in junior and senior year so that I'll be more responsible. Knowing how much I can make would help me make a point with my parents",

Plus, Binghamton has a pretty nice pipeline to companies in nyc, esp financial firms, big 4, etc.\n\nIn my opinion, since there is a level of uncertainty with jobs/salary, I would just let your parents pay for your college and then once you start working you can pay them back. Hope this helps",

All my YouTube feed is literally filled with Econ content from economics explained, cnbc, Money and macro, Graham Stephen ( it's personal finance really but helps know some stuff ). \n\nWhy do I want to do CS majors? I always wanted to learn coding but could never get going because school is all pen and paper based and we never had computers as a subject. \n\nI don't really know how manageable double majors is or even if it's worth doing.",

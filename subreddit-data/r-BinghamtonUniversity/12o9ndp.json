I'm wondering, if I am accepted off the waitlist at another school, do I have to pay for the dorm I signed up for at Binghamton? I might not hear back from the other school until summer, which is after I signed up for a dorm...I don't really want to jeopardize a potential acceptance and be bound to a dorm, if that makes any sense.",

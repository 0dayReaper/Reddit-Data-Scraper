    "postText": "im an international student who is gonna be attending BU for fall 2023. me along with 3 other students decided to stay together off campus so we started searching for properties on facebook marketplace. we found a rental we were interested in and we messaged the landlord (james moretta). \n\nso the property is under renovation and it's not even been 3 days since I've messaged him and he's going on and on about signing the lease and how many other groups are \"dying\" for the place. this raised a huge red flag for me. should I just sign the lease or move on?\n\nthe thing is renovations are not close to over and since im an international student, i won't be able to view the property. im really confused and i have no idea what to do or who to ask",

Usually the way it goes is they try to get you to see the place first in order to get you interested, in hopes you then sign.\n\nIt sounds suspicious to me. I would go with your gut and look elsewhere. Apartments.com is a good place to start.",

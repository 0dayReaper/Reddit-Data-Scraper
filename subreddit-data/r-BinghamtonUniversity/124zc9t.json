    "postText": "I'll be starting my freshman year this fall and will be 24 when I do so. I am moving to Binghamton from a very rural area about an hour, hour and a half away, and I only know 2 people who live in the area. \n\nWhile I'm very excited to finally go to college I worry about making friends, since I know BU has a smaller-than-average nontraditional student population. I have had very different experiences than most 18-21 year olds who I suspect most of my classes will be with, and am in a completely different phase of my life than most of them. It would be much more comfortable and appropriate for me to befriend people closer to my age (ideally between 22 and 28.) Does anyone have any tips as to where I can go, or what I can do to tap into this older student population? Or even non-students.",

            "comment": "I was 26 when I started at BU - I'll be days away from 30 when I graduate this semester. I had zero issues making friends. Definitely go to some GIM (general interest meetings) for clubs that you find interesting; it can't hurt to see what's available. The \"worst\" part for me was that I wasn't into any party scenes, but that didn't affect the good relationships I fostered in my classes. I just didn't hang out with people too frequently in the late evenings. \n\nYou've already realized you're at a different stage in your life than the average college student, and that's okay. My biggest piece of advice is to not enter into the college experience already close-minded to other students being younger and thus not good for friendships. If you're determined to only foster relationships with older students, clubs will probably be your best bet. I met almost all the graduate students I know through clubs or extracurricular/arts programs.",

And I feel you with missing the party scene. \n\nThe last portion- I understand what you're saying and I think it's a fine way to feel. I just personally feel like it would be actually *inappropriate* for me to seek those relationships with students that are so much younger. The same way I don't befriend high schoolers- I view them similarly. I am open to possibly being wrong about that, though! I'll find out.\n\nGreat comment, I appreciate it.",

It's going to take time but if you are willing and engaging, it should be okay. That's actually one of the reasons why I stayed at the university. Good luck!",

So, what are your interests?  \n\nFor meeting students, I don't think you have access yet, but there's a listing of all of the groups that you can search called B-Engaged.  Also, the groups will have General Information Meetings.  Definitely check out those out.  \n\nFor non-students, it's really going to come down to your interests.  For example, there's a local hiking group just for residents in your age bracket.  It was formed on Reddit, so if you search the r/Binghamton subreddit hopefully it pops up.\n\nFinally, don't discount making friends with your fellow students.  As a freshman many years ago, one of my best friends in school was older than you are now.",

I was sent the discord link to the hiking group, so Ill join that if I get brave enough, haha.\n\nAs for the last part- a handful of people feel the way you do, which I think is fair. For me it almost feels inappropriate, considering how different our experiences are. Younger college students very much feel like high schoolers to me, who I also do not seek friendships with as an adult. I may try to stick with older students.\n\nThanks for your help! It really is appreciated.",

I can\u2019t speak to your other interests.   The hiking group seemed like a great group of people.  There\u2019s also the Triple Cities Hiking Club, which is going to be a much older demographic.  Finally, check out the Broome County 12 Hiking Challenge.  It\u2019s a list of 12 trails that you hike and can get a patch at the end.  My son and I did it a few years ago.",

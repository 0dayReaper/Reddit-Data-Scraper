I only know a dozen or so of my dad's generation's songs, and I'm probably not \\*that\\* intrinsically passionate about them as you guys might be. Either way, I'll still be giving it my all on stage and in rehearsal, since singing is singing. If you guys are still down, hmu! \\^\\^",

Nonetheless, it has been a itching passion and dream of mine to join one and be able to scream and express on stage since I came into this simulation. I have been trying to enter the live music world for a while now. I would love to have the opportunity to try our for your band. I have been messing around with the producing (DAWS) world recently and I love to sing. Fun fact, I actually made Bon Jovi the topic of one of my projects in elementary school. Musically, I\u2019de say I am a grunge rock guy at heart who also loves pop, rap and good music. If you guys are still looking HMU (or know of any other positions).",

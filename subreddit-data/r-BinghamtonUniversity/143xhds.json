But CIW in general is very central to basically everything on campus and you are close to 2 dining halls in Oneida (CIW and App). Try to potentially live with an RA because then you get a private bathroom which is very ideal in my opinion.  To get an earlier time slot is based on credits, so whoever has the most credits in your group will have the earlier time slot, so as a freshman you will still have a later time slot but you will be choosing during the school year. It gets better as you go further with your credits so you can get the better rooms or move off campus after freshman year, then you dont need to worry about time slots!",

Any difference is purely marginal. Nobody is going to pick a Stony grad over a Bing grad because allegedly Stony has better stem. \n\n\u201cStony has better stem\u201d is honestly what people tell themselves to cope with the lack of social life",

Both are quite respectable places for cogsci and psych+lang though.",

Harpur is huge and if you make inroads with the right faculty early you can get fantastic research experience. If you\u2019re just talking about school status they\u2019re basically interchangeable for those majors and I would make my decision based on the financials.",

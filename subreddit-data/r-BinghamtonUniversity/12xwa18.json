    "postText": "Hello, I checked my degree-works this morning and I noticed that my APUSH credit waived an social science requirement and my sociology credit from dual enrollment/college-now waived an elective course\u2026 is this normal? Shouldn\u2019t my sociology class waive the social science requirement and my apush credit waive something related to US history or smth like that? (These credits were earned in high school). I am confused how Binghamton does their credit evaluations as I am a transfer. Sorry and hopefully someone can allow me to understand.",

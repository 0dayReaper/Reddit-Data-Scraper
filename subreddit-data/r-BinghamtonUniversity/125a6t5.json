The status page says I will have a decision by April 1, but the chances  will attend BU are pretty slim because I feel like taking so long shows a lack of concern.  Not the environment I want to join.   I thought Binghamton was my top choice, now ready to accept University of Buffalo, who sent an acceptance in December, 5 weeks after I applied.",

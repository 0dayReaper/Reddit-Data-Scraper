The issue w/ being by yourself is that you choose your room last out of everyone\u2014you're considered an open priority instead of a fill priority; the less credits you have earned, the later in the day you choose as well.\n\nIf you would like more info, you can find it here: https://www.binghamton.edu/residential-life/housing/returning/index.html\n\nIn general, expect communities such as Mountainview, Dickinson, and Hinman to have no spaces available after just a few hours/days.",

If you also have a profile on the housing website (with a description of yourself, you likes and dislikes, etc.) then it is also likely that someone might find your profile and swing you a message asking if you'd like to join their group. Unfortunately, however, unless you actually have friends/know people on campus, it is much more unlikely (but again, it is still possible if you ask around reddit/other communities and make a roommate profile)\n\nHaving 33 credits, that means that, theoretically, if you do end up going in by yourself, you would be the second of 3 groups to choose a room (51+ credits choose first, 33-50 credits choose the next hour, and 0-32 credits choose last). I may, however, be off a couple of credits as this is the designation for the apartments open priority, not the on-campus open priority, but it should still be approximately the same.\n\nAside from that, I would recommend taking a lot of the info in this comment w/ a grain of salt, as I'm mostly providing information for \"Returning Students.\" It's slightly different for \"New Students.\"\n\nFor new students, the link could be found here: https://www.binghamton.edu/residential-life/housing/index.html. Though the website doesn't have too much information for new students yet as it is still a ways off.",

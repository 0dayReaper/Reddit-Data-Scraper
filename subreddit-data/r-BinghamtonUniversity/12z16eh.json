            "comment": "South side is a great place. Great restaurants. (Highly recommend South city gastro pub, neezuntos, whole in the wall, and nips for wings) The zoo is up there. Cool bridge to downtown. You can easily bike places, BUT you have to walk your bike BACK because of the hills.\n\nJust don\u2019t go to the gas station. People get beat and robbed there on a semi regular basis. Somehow it\u2019s only that one spot and the rest of the neighborhood is ok.",

            "comment": "I actually rented down there as a graduate student a few years back! It's a fantastically underappreciated area for a student. The rent is very reasonable, as far as Binghamton goes, and you can find entire homes/split units instead of just apartments or townhouses for equivalent cost. The area is safe and quiet, and the proximity to the hospital is nice if you care for that sort of thing. Our rental was a first floor of a two floor house, and we planted a garden, had a driveway, had friendly neighbors, etc.\n\nIt's not even slightly bikeable due to the awful incline the area is built on, but the walk isn't too bad. It's really close to downtown, actually. My wife and I would walk to hockey games from our house all the time. Definitely a good place to live for a student with a car and less interest in campus life. It's not your traditional student life experience, would recommend only for the more mature student, but if that's your thing, you can't beat it in terms of cost/safety/location.",

All the pictures are very old; it had been updated when we lived there, since after the Zillow post was last updated. You could drive by and check it out.\n\nhttps://www.zillow.com/homes/55-Mitchell-Ave-Binghamton,-NY-13903_rb/29724419_zpid/?\n\nI believe the bottom floor was 1600 square feet. Now, it certainly had its downsides, and I'm not sure what prices would be in the area today, but it was miles ahead of the places my graduate cohort were living in for more money.",

Looks like rentals are in the same sorta area, and that's really reasonable compared to $500-600 a bedroom for downtown, or studios / 1bdrs for a ton more.\n\nProperty you were in looks really interesting from Google Maps as well! Looks like they have a barn in the back.",

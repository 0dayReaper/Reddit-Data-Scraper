    "postText": "I applied to Bing this year and somehow got in despite less than ideal test scores, but I was accepted for the Spring 2024 semester and waitlisted for Fall 23. That on its own is fine \u2013 I can complete some classes at the local CC in the meantime, but my biggest worry is entering essentially halfway through the year. I\u2019m a bit worried that housing, socializing, etc will all be so much harding going in in the spring. Anyone here have advice/experience with this?",

Although I don\u2019t have experience myself, my friend who was a spring admit in her freshman year said she had no problems at all. As long as you\u2019re friendly, you\u2019ll make friends and find yourself involved. Best of luck!!! :)",

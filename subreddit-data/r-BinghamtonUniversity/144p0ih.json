    "postText": "So I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I have my room selection in like an hour. At first my roommate and I were hoping to get a suite, but the available rooms list says there\u2019s nothing left. Then, we filtered by triples because we want a private bathroom. The list is saying that there\u2019s available triple rooms in CIW, but that\u2019s confusing me because the Bing website doesn\u2019t list CIW as having that room style??? It would be great if someone could clarify for me!",

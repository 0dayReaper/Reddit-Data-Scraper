They're popular as work/study spots. \n\nAt night time, Red Jug is the most popular grad student spot imo, because they don't really accept fakes so I'd say most people there are 21+.",

The GSO social events aren't as big a mixer as you'd imagine, even with the free drinks. Most people go with pre-existing friends, get their drink, and then leave.\n\nI would highly recommend getting involved in your department's GSO sub-organization. They constantly need volunteers at both the suborgs and with the Senate.",

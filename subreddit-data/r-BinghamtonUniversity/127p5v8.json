If you\u2019re in stem like my roommate, it might be a little more difficult. However, that\u2019s just stem vs non stem majors in general. \n\nThe only drawback is the bus, which we have a direct bus to go from one campus to another. Basically, if you decide to take a 10am class, you\u2019ll have to catch the 9:25 bus to go to class on time. Another thing would be the dining, since the plan you buy for Binghamton campus can\u2019t be used on Broome\u2019s campus. \n\nYou do get both resources from both campuses, and the library is really nice at Broome in my opinion. If you do decide to join the program, you\u2019ll get to meet other people in the program so you\u2019ll be able to make friends slightly easier without worrying if they\u2019re in the BAP program or not.",

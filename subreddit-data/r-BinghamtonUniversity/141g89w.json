    "postText": "Hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit. This one will run a bit like a rant but hopefully this information prevents someone else from falling victim to Amicus. There is a tl;dr on the bottom as well.\n\nTo begin, I've been renting with Amicus the last school year and, thankfully, just moved out and into a new place. Firstly, when my roommates and I were looking at the house they had just purchased it. The place was a mess with paint ripping off every wall, the entire kitchen floor was dislodged (pieces of it were coming out all last year), and the shower was incredibly dirty. However, we did not have many options and they told us they will fix everything before we move in. Like suckers, we trusted them.\n\nUnlike most students at Bing, I had to move in July because I got a job that started before the school year. When I moved in, I was surprised to find that Amicus was doing major renovations on the house (like tearing down walls, making a new porch, and all new siding). They never told us about these renovations but I did not mind it because I thought this would make our living experience better. However, when they finished putting in the new porch, there were no more interior renovations. We were left with a house that is falling apart and dirty. For the next three months, they were only doing construction on the outside of the house. During that time, we constantly had issues with their contractors blocking our off-street parking. No matter how many times we made a stink about parking, Amicus would refuse to do anything. I was late to work everyday for a week because they kept blocking my car in. Eventually, they told us to park our cars in the neighbors lot (they owned it). The neighbors, rightfully, were very upset and wanted us to move. Eventually, they angrily called us and said that we had to park on-street until the construction finished. Our off street parking lot is moderately sized so, if the contractors were considerate, there would be enough room for everyone. Instead, they somehow always put their trucks, cars, and heavy machinery right in front of our cars and in the driveway. No matter how many times we asked for reasonable accommodations so everyone can do their job, Amicus ignored us. Then we lost, what we considered, one of the most promising parts of the house: ample off-street parking. Amicus did nothing to make it right.\n\nDuring one weekend in July, I left to visit my parents. Apparently, one of the contractors went into the house without any notice and forgot to lock up after himself. The following day, a total stranger knocked on the door and noticed it was unlocked and walked in. Thankfully by then I put up a Ring Camera and caught everything on video. Amicus took their time coming to the house after the incident since I wasn't in town. They never said sorry or did anything to right the situation. That also wouldn't be the last time they came into the house without notice and forgot to lock up the house after themselves.\n\nWhile they were continuing work on the house, they never told us when to expect the contractors to come back as they didn't work every day. When we asked for notice ahead of time, they said they did not have a schedule for them.  This was a massive breach of our privacy since our female roommate felt uncomfortable with grown men on our roof with access to her windows without **ANY NOTICE**\u00a0which went on for weeks on end. These grown men would also say the most vial, racist, and sexist things for hours on end while we were in our respective bedrooms. This is not to mention that the level of noise that was conducted on our house necessitated\u00a0a notice. Despite numerous attempts to get notice for upcoming dates and times, we were ignored and we had to just put up with this nonsense.\n\nSince this post is already so long, I'll wrap up by saying that when the construction was over, they left a huge mess in our parking lot and expected us to clean it up. They were also almost never gave correct notice (either at all or incorrect times) for house showings. When we brought up any issue, they became defensive and would never address it. So, if you can, avoid Amicus like the plague. They will never give you notice for anything and get upset with you if you complain. Your privacy means nothing to them because you are just a check for them, not a person who should have their personal space respected.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or reach out if you are having any issues with them. I've learned a lot about housing law trying to get them to respect us.\n\nTl;Dr: Amicus renovated the outside of our house for months without telling us when the contractors would come. They blocked our parking lot for months and became angry when complained. They also came into the house without notice, forgot to lock up, and someone trespassed into our house.   Avoid them like the plague. You will never get notice for anything.",

When we first moved in last year, we were promised a new kitchen counter, never got it. The last tenants left the house messed up; kitchen and bathroom sinks were clogged with utensils (?), bathroom window and window behind dryer was broken and patched up with bubble wrap with broken glass around it, the fridge wasn\u2019t cold and the washing machine shook super bad. I had a list of probably 30 maintenance request that I shouldn\u2019t have had to put in. They decided they were going to start building a side porch over the summer and came in through the kitchen unannounced, thank fully a roommate was there to lock the door but still. \n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t been nice to know that the two houses next door were (I\u2019m like 90% sure) crackhouses. If I knew that I was going to be living next to people who argue from 12 am to 4 am, screaming in the street and going through my garbage, I never would\u2019ve considered the place. I get it, they have alot of properties to maintain, but they seem like they\u2019re there for the money more than quality.",

Secondly I\u2019d get a lawyer to write a letter informing them that entering your home without proper notice is trespassing and that law enforcement will be called if it happens again. These rental places take advantage of students because they don\u2019t think you know your rights- A lawyer usually gets their attention. Also alert the Off Campus College Office. Their email is occ@binghamton.edu. They also have resources that talk about renters bill of rights you should know what your legal standings are before signing a lease. Sorry this happened to you OP.",

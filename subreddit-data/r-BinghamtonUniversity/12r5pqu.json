    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming grad student and I\u2019m considering signing a lease with LiveInBing, but I have some reservations. The photos on the listing that I was looking at don\u2019t appear to actually be for the apartment that is listed, as it\u2019s showing photos of a two bedroom when the listing is for a one bedroom. I\u2019m also concerned that the lease says the only acceptable form of contact between me and the landlord would be through appfolio and that any other type of communication (phone, email, etc) would not be responded to, aside for time-sensitive emergencies or lease extensions. There were emails listed for concerns and payments but all repairs and maintenance are outsourced and it seems like most repairs would have to be covered by the tenant even if it\u2019s not their fault. Their website also seems full of stock photos which in my experience has been a red flag with rental companies.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this company? Are they reputable and good to rent from, or should I find something else? Thanks!",

Crazy expensive for what it is, high staff turnover so you never know who to deal with, says utility included but they have you pay \"overages\"- impossible to avoid if you wants to shower or wash dishes regularly.",

So you would pursue that during or after undergrad. Pretty much all of my accounting professors talk about the CPA exam and say what will be on it/what won\u2019t when teaching, and they talk about the structure of it (although I think it\u2019s changing soon). I do know that you pretty much have to do the 4+1 masters in accounting program in order to reach the requirements to qualify to be CPA certified, which is 150 credits (some of those credits in specified areas). You will only reach 120-130 credits just getting an undergrad degree here. Other ppl I\u2019ve talked to have said their employer offered CPA study materials or low prices for CPA study materials.",

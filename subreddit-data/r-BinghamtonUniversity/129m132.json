The professors are ok in my opinion nothing unbearable and usually there\u2019s only one or two professor options for big classes, so everyone\u2019s in it together. There\u2019s not a lot of presentations for accounting specifically \n, but there are for the other management classes. Coming from someone who absolutely hates presentations with all my soul, they\u2019re not that bad as u think and u get over it. \u201cBusy work\u201d depends on the professor but some/most of them do like online homeworks or this thing called packback that are easy 100s",

It\u2019s group projects and most of it will be for mgmt 111 which is a required course. It tends to change up a lot but for me we had to do like 3 case comps and only presented to one or two people, and then we also had to do a 5 min speech which was easy. I have rly bad public speaking anxiety but this has helped me get better. we are also doing case comp type presentations in mgmt 311 now. theyre not bad at all bc everyone has to do it. lmk if u have any other questions!",

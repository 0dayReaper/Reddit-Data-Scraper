I\u2019m wondering if I could email my admissions counselor some questions about my deferral but mainly to show that I am still very interested in this school. Would this help my chances of being accepted at all?",

Make sure you include that Bing is your number 1 choice and if accepted, you will attend. Update them on your senior year and make sure to keep it 1 page max. Please see YouTube videos on writing a LOCI best of luck.",

I wrote LOCIs for every school that deferred me. I am also a senior in HS, though I was accepted to Bing but deferred from a lot of other schools, and I sent LOCIs to them. I don't think you need to update them on your grades because Bing will already receive a mid-year report from your school that shows them your grades. You could include a sentence on your stellar academics if you wanted to, but in my LOCIs I just talked about my continued involvement in my extracurriculars and stuff. Also, a LOCI doesn't guarantee acceptance but will increase your chances than if you didn't send one.",

Is it a prestigious program or is it offered to most SOM students? Please let me know if you can, thank you.",

I\u2019ve really liked the program so far! It lets you network and meet professionals really easily as well as expose you to new careers. If you are already thinking of committing to bing, it can only help you!",

EY is also smaller and newer- so you have more of chance to really shape what u want to get out of the program. I\u2019m on the EY e-board so if u need more clarification pm me :)",

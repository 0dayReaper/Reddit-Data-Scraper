    "postText": "With the end of the semester and finals season, I've been seeing a lot of people absolutely devasted about their grades, whether they failed a course or got a C/D. \n\nI'm just coming on here to say that as a former Bing undergrad student, current Bing Master's student, and as a faculty member, in the long run, one or a few \"undesirable\" grades will not make or break you in the long run, whether you're a freshman, senior, pre-health, pre-law, etc. Grades like Cs, Ds, Fs affect your overall GPA less than you think, especially when you already have a lot of other classes under your belt. \n\nWhen you apply for grad/med school or look for jobs after graduation, they give you a chance to explain any \"discrepancies,\" on your transcript - it's not like they're going to see one C or F and then immediately disqualify you. Also, any type of post-grad application is more than likely going to take a holistic approach to the admissions process. GPA is not everything. They also look at extracurriculars, internships, volunteering, etc., and from what I know from my own job search, employers prefer someone who is well-rounded with an \"average\" GPA than someone with a 4.0 who doesn't do much outside of the classroom. In some cases it is even beneficial to play an \"undesirable\" grade in your favor, like \"in my first semester here, I didn't do as well as I wanted, but I committed myself to my education and turned my GPA around,\" something like that. \n\nI am honestly just heartbroken at the people who question their self-worth over their grades. I am guilty of it too, but I am really seeing students under immense pressure to perform and it hurts that it's been so detrimental on mental health. You are more than your grades and there is always an option to get \"back on track,\" no matter how hopeless you think your situation may be.\n\nThe possibilities for this are endless: you can take the course again if you didn't meet a grade minimum for a major (retaking things does not replace grades but it allows you to have a better grade listed on your transcript), you can take \"easy\" classes to get some As to help your GPA, you can take classes elsewhere and transfer the credit in if you're short on requirements, etc. \n\nSometimes you may have to compensate on things and that is totally okay. Maybe you didn't get your top major pick - there are similar majors, minors out there for you. At the end of the day, you only need a 2.0 GPA minimum for a degree, and just having a Bachelor's alone opens a lot of doors. I did horribly in a lot of my undergrad classes but it has never once come back to haunt me, and I earned a degree at the end of it all.\n\nIn the moment it's difficult and understandable to be overwhelmed and to be upset with yourself, but I promise in the long-run that things will shape out. There is always hope.",

            "comment": "I think this is different for Watson because failing a class could set you back a year since many niche major required classes are only offered in either Spring/Fall. The luxury of failing a class would mean paying for an extra year of undergrad since classes usually are prerequisites for the next class and if you don't pass those you have to retake them. I know some 5th-year Watson seniors and it is not fun, I don't envy them.",

                    "comment": "TL;DR: A little over a week ago, Pipe Dream, the school newspaper, published a column talking about how TikTok is beneficial for learning about other cultures and hearing the perspecives of POC, and the like. Basically how TikTok helps to open people up to diverse worldviews. The author of the piece mentioned how they grew up in a homogenous ethnic neighborhood, and how they mostly just went to Jewish schools and summer camps, so they weren't really being exposed to other cultures. [You can find this piece here](https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/119167/auto-draft-629/).\n\nIn the latest issue of the Binghamton Review, the school's non-partisan (but mostly right-leaning) publication, they took several quotes from that Pipe Dream article, as well as others, and put their responses to them below. Specifically, they took \" I went to a private Jewish day school from kindergarten all the way through to the end of high school. I did Jewish youth group, went to Jewish camps, the works,\" and responded with \"Did those 'Jewish camps' help you with your concentration?,\" making a reference to the Holocaust off of the original author's use of the term \"Jewish camps.\" [Here is a link to a Reddit post that has a screenshot of the quote.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinghamtonUniversity/comments/jzucb4/this_is_straight_from_page_4_of_the_binghamton/)\n\nSome students are upset at this \"joke,\" as it can be considered to be of an anti-semitic nature. Others, including the author of the Binghamton Review quote, and the Editor-in-Chief, have responded saying they themselves are Jewish and found it funny, and/or that they have Jewish colleagues who also found it funny, and, in the case of the EIC, who is not Jewish, that the \"joke\" was merely a play-on-words of the Pipe Dream author's phrasing, and that it was not meant to mock the Holocaust and its victims. The two just mentioned have commented on the previously linked Reddit post, if you would like to read the discourse. \n\nThere is also considerable backlash to the EIC and the Review as a whole on Pipe Dream's latest Instagram post, where they released a statement saying their actions were \"disgusting, unwarranted and unacceptable.\" The EIC replied, again using the same line of defense, and many were quick to debate them, a majority of students being Jewish themselves, saying they thought the Review's quote to be offensive to them and their Jewish heritage. In a (potentially since-deleted comment, as I cannot find the original), they stated something along the lines of \"I'm not sorry people found this offensive.\" They have since updated (and/or retracted) said original statement, saying \"I honestly did not expect it to cause backlash,\" and \"I apologize to anyone that was offended by what we published.\" [You can find Pipe Dream's post, as well as the EIC's comments here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH9IUIqrqy1/?igshid=14rjuzjw4mmbf)\n\nThe meme on this post is making a joke that most students offended are merely white, non-Jewish students who are offended on the Jewish community's behalf, although the merit this claim has is debatable, as looking at many of the comments, most people responding are Jewish, and therefore take personal offense to the statements made.",

They hear anti-semitism exists, but never leave their bubbles so they're reacting over the smallest thing. Anti-Semitism isn't making a holocaust joke, anti-semitism is blaming the Jews for the world's problems, believing in the\"jewish conspiracy,\" wanting to hurt Jews, blaming Jews for the death of Christ. A lot of radical Muslims also hate jews. Your \"Go back to the camps you kikes!\"example portrays actual hatred and malice with no attempt to be light-hearted. It's usually a lot more blunt. \n\nI also grew up in a jewish bubble and we were always warned about anti-semitism in the world, but I never encountered any growing up since Jews are very common in the Nyc metro area. People that never leave the bubble likely have never faced real anti-semitism. If they're walking around with this defensive mentality, they're probably over eager to call foul and that's why they've lowered the bar on what they constitute as anti-semitic. It's crazy, if these people want to confront antisemites, go to voat or ruqqus where they basically took over the forums, not this mundane thing.\n\nDrawing swastikas, not antisemitic. Drawing one on a house where Jews live, anti-semitic since it can be seen as a threat. \n\nIt's all about context and intent. The concentration pun was clearly a joke and there was no malice. It was also a super tame dad joke. If the interviewer said it in a creepy Nazi German accent, \"would you say it helped your... concentration\" that would have at least gotten a chuckle from me.\n\nSo I agree, not offensive, but also not funny because poor delivery. South Park did it better, but it was really the over the top caricature of Kyle's jewish cousin that made it hilarious and watching cartman squirm trying to fight his compulsive urge to call the cousin names. The concentration joke was the least offensive part in the bit.",

Hilariously enough the kinds of people that get offended by dark humor in the Jewish community seem to be the most disconnected from the dark events, oddly.\n\nLike the weird TikTok holocaust thing-- was it in bad taste? Yes. Was it in good intentions? Yes, kinda, somewhat for clout. Did I care? No I just shrugged it off. But who was most outraged? Non-jews (and from my personal circle jews that are disconnected from the holocaust, never had a family member be a victim, etc), which I'd say shouldn't make things so cancel-culturey.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's plenty of past reasons to cancel the Binghamton Review from their past behavior and weird takes. But this isn't one of them. If they said \"go back to the camps, *Abschaum!*\"...yeah, that's clearly antisemetic and just disgusting. But a dark pun is nothing IMO.",

Essentially, if you have lighter melanin skin and come from a country whose culture is more based around the old testament, you're \"white\" in the eyes of the U.S. government.

Clearly, ethiopian Jews aren't white...or are they? I don't freaking know..\n\nIt all gets pretty backwards. Like Turks. They literally look like any other white person, but since their country is more culturally associated with Islam, they get grouped in with other middle eastern countries like Pakistan where skin complexion is noticeably darker, so Turks aren't considered white. \n\nWe seem to have gone the other way on the \"\"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" quote from MLK.",

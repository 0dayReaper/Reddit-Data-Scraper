Air pods in step right of the curb today mid road  not near the crosswalk almost get smashed.\n\nI honestly don't think she even knew what happened. Kept walking never even stopped looking at phone. \n\nI thought I was going to witness a death",

You can have the right of way and still be dead; those aren't mutually exclusive. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm from a rougher part of the city, but I just can't understand the rationale behind making sure the street is empty or the driver slows down for you before you cross. Even if there's a light or a stop sign, it's basically ingrained in me to not just assume they'll stop",

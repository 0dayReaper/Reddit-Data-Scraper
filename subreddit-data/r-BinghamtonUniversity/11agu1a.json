Typically they also have a tough time w schedule 1 drugs like adderall but there\u2019s other meds like strattera that they will fill prescriptions for. But they won\u2019t write the prescription. Again, that\u2019s an in town thing. Good luck!",

There's also a guy in Endicott area, dr Mostera (or something close to that) as well as somewhere in vestal, 4 corners something. I think it's on main street in vestal??? I never ended up going oops. \n\nMostera has a self-quiz thing that I have filled out several times in the past couple years-- it's funny (sad) seing my answers get progressively worse \ud83d\ude43",

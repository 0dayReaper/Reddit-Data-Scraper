I\u2019m able to get my full workout in (4-5 different exercises) without having to wait for a machine or space if I\u2019m willing to make some alterations to my program for that day. Timing is everything though, I go earlier in the day (10-12pm) and it\u2019s usually fine however if you go anywhere from 2-7pm it will be hard to get a good workout in IMO. Also, I would say about 40-50% of the gym space is dedicated to weightlifting as opposed to cardio and calisthenics.",

Going before 12 you\u2019ll be fine, 12-2 is hit or miss, and any time after 2 it\u2019ll be really full and crowded and hard to work out. I go at 11 everyday and sometimes it\u2019s still hard to get the machine I want or a bench. Next semester I\u2019m gonna get a membership anywhere else haha",

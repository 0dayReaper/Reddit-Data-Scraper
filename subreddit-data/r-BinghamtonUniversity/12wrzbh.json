I like rap too \u2014 last show I went to was Run the Jewels \u2014 but if you look at the SA surveys, about half the student body wants country or rock and not rap. If we always bring in rap acts because they get 51% of the vote, then that other half never gets a show they would attend.\n\nI have no idea who any of these bands are, but that\u2019s half the fun. If any of them make it big, you get to say you saw them way back when.",

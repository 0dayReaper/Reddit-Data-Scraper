            "comment": "Hello. Our department is very research-active, with a lot of people working on AI, especially computer vision. A quick list includes professors Jeremy Blackburn, Ken Chiu, Weiying Dai, Adnan Rakin, Sujoy Sikdar, Lijun Yin, Shiqi Zhang, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Zhang, myself, and likely others. Computer Science research these days is quite fluid and interdisciplinary, and many researchers who often work in other areas (i.e robotics, computer systems, cloud computing) incorporate computer vision, deep learning, and NLP into their research. Furthermore, we are hiring aggressively, so expect some new faces in the fall.",

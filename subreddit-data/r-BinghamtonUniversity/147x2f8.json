    "postText": "If you check student records over the course of the next few days your program changes. I got in for accounting!! \n\nFor those who are looking to apply I applied for my sophmore year, I had a 3.9 GPA with high school credit for macro (A- in a college class) and calc (3 on AP) as well as at Bing I had A in micro and B+ in stats and my total number of credits is 102 credits (had 70 from high school). For those who read the threads about IUT to SOM, I had a pass/fail grade and it wasn't viewed as a C/D. I also sent a message to admissions expressing my interest through taking Financial Accounting over the summer and doing an accounting internship as well. \n\nIUT to SOM is possible! I'm literally on cloud nine!!",

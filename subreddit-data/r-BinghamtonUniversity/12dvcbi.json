    "postText": "Hi there,\nTownie and Binghamton alum here wondering if any Spanish speaking students are staying in Binghamton over the summer and looking for a very easy gig.\n\nMy 3 year old (almost 4) has expressed that she would like to learn Spanish. I'm looking for someone who would come to teach her through play, an hour or two a week. Potential for some extra money through babysitting if she likes you.",

I was only suggesting summer because I know we're creeping up on finals and the kids are busy! So if you know anyone send em my way :)",

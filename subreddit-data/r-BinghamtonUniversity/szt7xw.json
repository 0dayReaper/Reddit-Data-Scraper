They have to prove she didn\u2019t consent and based on the time it took for the arrests it either took a while to procure concrete evidence, or they couldn\u2019t find any and had to gather as much testimony as they could. They\u2019re already right on the border of misdemeanors... and it seems like that\u2019s by design and these specific charges are not expected to stick.\n\nWho knows though, they could be on to something more and these charges are to buy a little more time and appease the public. From what I understand there are still multiple arrests to come so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are more charges as well.",

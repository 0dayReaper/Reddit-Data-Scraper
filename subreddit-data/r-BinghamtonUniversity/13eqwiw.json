    "postText": "Hello. I was admitted to the BME PhD program at Binghamton but I have not been able to secure funding. I was offered by one professor to work for a few months and if I was capable enough, he would offer me funding. I wanted to ask if this was a feasible option because I do not have the financial capacity to fund myself all throughout PhD. I also wanted to know if anyone had a similar experience?  Thanks!",

            "comment": "There are two ways to get paid in grad school Teaching Assistant and Research Funding. Most PhD. students are paid as TAs. You'll have a handful of responsibilities in a classroom setting and will require roughly 25 hrs per week depending on the assignment. This is what's given to students who are not supported with research funding. If you have any questions about how to become a TA reach out to your dept. Secretary. They will be able to get you all set up. Good Luck!",

Which building should they tear down to put in a new lot? Are you ever planning to donate to the school so they can build another garage or should they just buy up surrounding neighborhoods so the school can add to the housing crisis.",

And its simple - the lots are never full.    Just because they are not where you want them - \"ie  ..a mile away on the mountain top\" doesn't mean that they are not there, or not available. \n\nThis is a you problem.  Get to campus earlier so you have enough time to park farther away and make it class -- or continue to pay.",

My go to is the back of M lot, but at peak hours in weeks where lots of people still go to class, there will be like 5+ cars constantly trolling around just in that one parking lot. I think the longest it's ever taken me to find a spot was like 20 minutes. However, I think lots of schools have issues with parking, and our permit is way cheaper than some private schools.",

When I did it both my internship and class were remote and the class was really easy. However, when I did it COVID restrictions were still in place so idk if the class would be remote now. It\u2019s something you could look into though. And interning would also give you an opportunity to work in something you are actually interested in instead of taking a random filler class",

He takes attendance, but you literally just watch comedy and then there are like 2 papers throughout the semester (he might tell you there are 4, but he usually only does 2) that are dummy easy. You only need the writing skills of like an 8th grader",

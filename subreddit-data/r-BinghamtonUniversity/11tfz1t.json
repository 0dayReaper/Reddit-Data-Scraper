            "comment": "Living on campus with a meal plan cost roughly $18k a year. Housing is roughly $11k plus meal plan each semester Is an additional $7k depending on plan. You can reduce this cost by living in apartment communities and removing meal plan. But you\u2019ll still be paying roughly the same housing cost. \n\nOff campus housing assuming rent is $500, comes out to $6k a year. Depending on your food spending habits , if you spend $600 on food per month that comes to $7200 a year. \n\nSo this saves you $4800 a year on average. If you lived off campus for 3/4 years that saves you $14400. \n\nThese numbers are rough estimates and doesn\u2019t count factors such as transportation. Depending on where you live transportation could be a quick walk to a bus resulting in $0 transportation cost, but if you have a car then you must consider parking, gas, insurance etc.  \n\nHope this helps!",

That price is for sharing a house/apartment with at least one other roommate.\n\nIf you want to live alone, you can find 1BR/studios for $1000 or less (including utilities), but ideally you should start your search early so you have the most options available",

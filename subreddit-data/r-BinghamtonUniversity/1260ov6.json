    "postText": "Hello how are you all. I just got accepted into Binghamton today but through a special offer called the Binghamton Advantage Program where for a year I take classes at SUNY Broome, but live on the Binghamton campus. After a year of completing the required credits I become a full time Binghamton student. I was wondering if anyone had any information about this, such as if it is worth it, if it\u2019s difficult, or any information that can be provided. Thank you.",

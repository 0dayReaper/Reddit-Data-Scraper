If you do have to buy, just know you'll be paying a pretty penny since I bought mine for $120, they're almost certainly going to be more than that now.\n\nYour best bet is to ask someone else if they could lend you their cap and gown that is of similar height to you (they're fitted by height). Otherwise, if you're around 5' 9\" or 5' 10\" (~175-178 cm), I can lend you mine since I'm Watson",

The person does NOT have to be a student, can be any age and can even be a parent and child! It is in the small print of the 27 page lease.  Uclub is very nice but it\u2019s advertising is bullshit. It\u2019s housing. Not student housing. Housing.  Buyer beware.",

It is nice to have a gym at your disposal too, the appliances are new, the rooms are pretty big and everything\u2019s pretty nice. It is also nice to not have to deal with a sketchy landlord if something breaks, and I like having an area to study. I would recommend looking at other complexes or even at houses if it\u2019s more up your alley.",

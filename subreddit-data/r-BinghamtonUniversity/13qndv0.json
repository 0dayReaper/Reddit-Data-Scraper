    "postText": "Sorry if this is confusing but basically if I got a poor grade in a class, I know that if I retake the class through a different institution online then it doesn\u2019t count towards my GPA. But could I still have the original grade removed from my Binghamton GPA and just have it show that the credits for that class were transferred in? Or will the original grade from Binghamton university still be factored into my GPA even after I transfer in the credits in?",

            "comment": "From what I know, I really don't think you can drop a grade from your transcript. If you have a *very* compelling reason for doing so (like severe illness, family emergency, etc.), then maybe, but in these cases it's mostly expected for students to drop/withdraw from the course during the semester when they were enrolled in the course. If you take the course again somewhere else and transfer it in, and it's a direct equivalent to the Bing class, your credit will be zeroed out as you do not earn credit for retakes, but you may be able to have the class count towards a major requirement. However, the transfer course grade will not be factored into your GPA.",

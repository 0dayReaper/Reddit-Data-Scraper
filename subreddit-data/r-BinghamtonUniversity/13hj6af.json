But I\u2019d be paying 17k a year and so unfortunately I\u2019m staying at my commuters school. I\u2019m hoping next year is better than my first.",

Before you commit to anything I would call Bings financial aid dept because maybe there are opportunities you qualify for that you don\u2019t know about. I know living off campus can be done for $500 /m and personally my family qualifies for NYS aide which pays for my tuition. I don\u2019t mean to say it\u2019ll be easy but it\u2019s definitely more manageable that\u2019s 17k",

A Bing degree opens the door to heavy recruitment from NYC companies &amp; may be worth the extra money compared to a commuter school. Although some commuter schools are quite good, you didn\u2019t specify which you attend.  \n\nThis assumes you have a good GPA, a marketable major, like STEM or business &amp; are a NY resident. If you\u2019re out of state, the tuition diff may not be worth it, but if you\u2019re in state, I\u2019d pay the extra $ for Bing over most commuter schools\u2026",

Bing is prob better for business, but I believe Baruch new CS program is competitive. Baruch prob not as known outside NYC, compared to Bing, but neither will be as well known outside NY. You should be able to land a solid NYC job out of Baruch if your grades are good and prob less distractions from the social scene that you miss out on.",

If they make under $125k you\u2019re eligible for Excelsior scholarship, which is an extra $5500/year, but you commit to work in NY for a year for each year you get the award. Graduate school time counts towards the commitment also. That award needs to be specifically applied for and isn\u2019t part of the financial aid package the school will send. Pls keep that in mind if you didn\u2019t apply &amp; in case that extra $ would change your decision\u2026",

I was getting a nice refund from Tap and fasfa at Baruch, but at Bing, even the loans won't cover everything. I just decided to stay at Baruch, seeing as they're both good schools for finance, and I'm getting paid to go rather than going to Bing and having to work off the cost.",

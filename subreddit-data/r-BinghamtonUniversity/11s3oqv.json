It will be asynchronous, counts as an N (Social Sciences) and C (Composition), and you will not need to purchase any texts.\n\nSome unit themes include:  \n\ud83d\udc79Fighting Demons and Taming Beasts  \n\ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2640\ufe0fHoly Men as Brides of Christ  \n\ud83e\udd14Can God Be a Woman?  \n\nThe history of premodern Christianity is told typically through the elite perspectives of popes, kings, and bishops, but this course is more interested in the radical experimentation and spiritual demands of ordinary people. We will examine how claims to sanctity were used to enhance one's agency and communal status, as well as pay close attention to the response of Church authorities.\n\nEnrollment is open \ud83e\udd70 Feel free to email me for the syllabus or if you have any questions!",

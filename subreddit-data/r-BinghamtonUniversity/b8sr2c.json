You won't know if they mean the University or Broome Community College which are both SUNY. \n\n* **SUNY Binghamton** - how it appears on a drop down menu when applying for jobs\n\n* **The Bing-hamptons** - the name to reflect our self proclaimed prestige and Long Island student body. \n\n* **Binghamton University** - the unofficial, official name.\n\n* **Binghamton** - Short version that only pisses off townies because they think going to Binghamton means you go to Binghamton High School.

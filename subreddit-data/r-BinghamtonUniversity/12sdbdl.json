On average, one might have to commit around 5-7 years of their lives to just working, studying and clearing exams, which is not majority wants to do. \n\nYou may only become an actuary if you are passionate about becoming one.",

If you want to be an actuary it's a great program, if you want to study math in general it's better to just do a regular BS in math. You cam self study all the actuary exams at home, there is literally a study guide for each test. The exams are hard as others have noted. To get a job, it's all about the exams and how many you have passed. There is an actuary club on campus you should consider joining if you want further information. I decided to study physics and pure math because I didn't want to just do insurance, but I'm sure you could find a way to gap your knowledge to other fields as well.",

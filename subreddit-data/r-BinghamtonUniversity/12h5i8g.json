Until the enrollment deadline, individual posts will now be removed. If you see one, report under rule 4 (use relevant megathreads).",

Everyone is different and has unique circumstances, Bing will not work for everyone and that is totally fine. Advice from a stranger will not be able to take someone's background into account simply because they don't know you.",

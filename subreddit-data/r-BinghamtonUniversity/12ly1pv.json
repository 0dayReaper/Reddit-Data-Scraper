There is no huge townie-students beef like they make it out to be. The locals know that the university is bringing in business and revitalizing downtown. They just want a little respect and appreciation of the region\u2019s history. Spend time learning about local history, as you will soon be a small but important piece of it. It is not a shithole here. \n\n3. If you do ever have a car here, budget an extra $400-1k over the next 4 years for on campus parking tickets. No, not parking passes, parking tickets. They. Will. Get. You. \n\n4. Don\u2019t buy books from the bookstore, buy used online. \n\n5. Get off campus and try local owned restaurants downtown, in JC, Endicott. Don\u2019t just stick to the commercial crap on the vestal parkway. \n\n6. The weather will bring on seasonal depression like you\u2019ve never experienced. Make a plan for how you\u2019re going to handle it. \n\n7. Use the student health center. Your fees pay for it. Get any little thing checked out. You won\u2019t be on your parents insurance forever so soak up that sweet free to you healthcare while you can. Because the day you turn 30 everything starts flying off. It\u2019s coming faster than you think.\n\n8. Find something new to do totally unrelated to your major. Go to the General Interest Meetings of all the clubs. Go alone, you will meet people. \n\n9. Drink water between each alcoholic drink. \n\n10. Don\u2019t date jerks. Even if they tell you that they are not a jerk. Even if they tell you that YOU are the bad one. That\u2019s actually something a jerk does. If you do accidentally date a jerk, do not go on another date with them. You can just stop dating them. This is what I wish someone had told me before starting at BU.",

There can be humidity and thunderstorms. It\u2019s an exciting time in general and the weather is just background. \n\nThe Fall leaves from Sept to Oct will make you weep with their beauty. And also with allergies. You will never see anything quite like it. You will want to change your major to poetry. You\u2019ll see.\n\nOctober drops to cold fast. 60s. 50s. 30s. Is that snow? Your Halloween costume is not weather appropriate. Then comes the endless rain. \n\nNovember is brown and grey and rainy. December used to be a winter wonderland, but now it is more like November: rain, slush, slurry, wind, mud, and everything is grey. Campus is on a hillside and the buildings all cast shadows so there are almost so patches of sun. The wind is against you no matter what direction you face. There are no indoor short cuts between buildings but you never give up trying to find basement mazes. You discover the hidden cinema department, looks pretty cool. Your dorm is so far from your classrooms. Who designed this campus? \n\nJanuary is bitter cold. The wind is sharp. February too. These months blend together and never end and it is dark out by 5:30-6 pm. The snow is breathtakingly beautiful when it is freshly fallen and hangs on the pine branches. It looks like a Christmas card. Go play in it, it\u2019s blissful. This lasts about 6 hours then it falls off the branches and mixes in with the old dirty snow thaw-refreeze cycle. There is mud just everywhere.\n\nMarch is endless. Just survive. Don\u2019t think about it. \n\nApril is beautiful. We Spring forward and the sun is out. The crop tops and short shorts are out. Don\u2019t get too used to it- some of our record breaking blizzards have occurred during March-April. Welcome to False Spring. \n\nOn April 15th comes the Pollen. Your whole face revolts in allergic reaction to Mother Nature\u2019s gifts. You will also catch the flu/covid/an upper respiratory infection. But the buds on the trees and the birds are just lovely. However, now it\u2019s time to cram for finals and write lots of papers, so you can\u2019t go outside. Get back to work. \n\nJune is the best time of year here. The whole month of June is a tie with the best week of Fall. But BU is out so you will probably never know. \n\nRepeat x4.",

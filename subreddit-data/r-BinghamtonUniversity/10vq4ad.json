Looking for them to give you industry insight and tips?\nWhat do you know about them? What do they know about you? Is this someone you reached out to blindly over LinkedIn, is it a family friend? A possible mentor? Someone who wants to help students network through a program at Bing?\nWhat major are you? If it's business I probably cannot help you but I'm certain SOM has resources.",

I do think if the FPHL folds that Bing is drawing well enough to be considered for a major junior USHL or ECHL team. There will be hockey here for the foreseeable future.",

The editor in chief of The Hockey News tweeted that [there are positive developments for it happening in the near future last night](https://twitter.com/thnryankennedy/status/1645498138797703170?s=46&amp;t=VBxQUdVATM-SRzScpP3Dwg). Pretty solid source. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a realistic arrangement that doesn\u2019t involve cutting a deal with the city to use the arena downtown for games, at least to start. Only thing that may change that is another deep-pocketed alum/donor funding a new facility, there may be a precedent for that!\n\nStudents can attend the games and roll right out onto state street on weekends. At least to start, I\u2019d think they\u2019d be well-attended. \n\nCurious if they\u2019d be able to balance 30+ dates with the Black Bears and 18-20 for the Bearcats at the arena - not impossible based on the length of the seasons, but both the FPHL and college hockey schedule 2 games per weekend. \n\nDon\u2019t think BCC is large enough for a D1 program to host games but it\u2019s possible they could practice there.",

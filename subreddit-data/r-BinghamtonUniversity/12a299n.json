Just put your all into it, watch all the videos and use the notes and tutors. Since he\u2019s the only professor there really is no other choice, it\u2019ll be tough but you\u2019ll be able to do it. Good luck and lmk if u need help w anything",

I quit because I couldn't fit it into my schedule for the semester but this class was rather hard, however, I do think there's another tutor still at UTS for the class. The main challenge comes from how he words his questions on tests rather than the material itself. Most of the material is concepts and memorization aka typical bio stuff. When studying you have to make sure you watch his videos again as he will ask questions on exams specifically about the examples he gives in them. I liked to watch the videos while reading the lecture notes he posted with them for extra reinforcement. When you're answering questions on the test keep in mind what concept the question is testing you on. He will try to confuse you with answers that may be correct but they're not \"the most correct\".  If you have any  questions about the class feel free to message me this professor is my arch nemesis. Good luck in your studies!",

Watching videos averaged 45 minutes long every 2 days, accompanied with a sum of notes, is just tedious. His lectures last at most 30 minutes with the next hour of lecture intended on being spent doing a stupid group assignment with your forced group you get from discussion. And don\u2019t even get me started on the exams. 50 questions of picking the \u201cmost right\u201d answer for at 49 of them, with one being about an actual concept. Got nothing higher than a 51 on any of the 3 exams, not including the final (got a 54) and I still ended with a B- in the course due to its insane curve. The class is curved this way because he is so well aware of how poorly his students do, and if they proceeded to do this bad, he would probably lose his job. This man is a horror show, absolute trainwreck and his course reflects this perfectly. My only advice is to take Bio113 first, as some of the basic stuff there is then retaught in  bio 114.",

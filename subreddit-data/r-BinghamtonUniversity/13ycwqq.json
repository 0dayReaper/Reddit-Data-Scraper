    "postText": "Incoming freshmen and i just got my housing time yesterday. My slot is june 6th at 4pm (the second day after housing starts) so i want to know my chances of getting a 4 person suite in mountainview. And if not that what my chances are of getting the 3 other people with me into a 6 person suite (since i have the earliest time in my group i\u2019ll have to place us all). I was also just wondering what mountainview dorm would be recommended.",

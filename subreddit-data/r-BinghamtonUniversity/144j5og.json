            "comment": "I did it Spring 2022, however I didn\u2019t do the French fluency / internship program. I took all of my classes in English (if I knew French better I would\u2019ve chosen French but I just couldn\u2019t). I took two courses at Universit\u00e9 Paris 7, and two through the Sorbonne. The experience was definitely life changing and amazing, so even though I can\u2019t help you with the internship stuff I still strongly recommend it! If u have any other questions feel free to pm",

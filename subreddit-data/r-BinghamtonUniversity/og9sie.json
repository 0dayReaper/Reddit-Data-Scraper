    "postText": "Congrats! You made it to Binghamton University! Or perhaps you're still applying.\n\nAs I conclude my senior year and plan my future, I wanted to give a brutally honest, biased, and unwavering guide to college (specifically Binghamton University) from a student's perspective. I learned a lot over these past 4 years, and none of this information was handed out to me or even suggested. It was all learned through experience. I formatted this guide so that you read the most important info first. It\u2019s quite lengthy, so if you\u2019re pressed for time, then I hope you gain at least some benefit from only a partial reading.  I also must abide by the Reddit character limit, which is unfortunate since I love to add fluff to my writing.\n\n1.\tThere\u2019s no such thing as a healthy, productive night owl. I recently had a conversation with a friend who said something along the lines of \u201cif you miss the 9 am train, then your day is already over.\u201d If there\u2019s one piece of advice that I could give to make your next 4 years a little better, it\u2019d be to wake up early. There\u2019s a reason why the real world operates from 9 am to 5 pm. That\u2019s also when the human body is generally the most productive. Unfortunately, academia isn\u2019t the real world. You might have a class at 8 am and a class at 7:30 pm. It\u2019s very easy, especially freshman year when all you (should) care about are classes, to stay up until 2 am in the library and wake up a 8 am to start the day fresh. This works when you\u2019re young and ready to tackle the tiny world known as your transcript. But when you\u2019re even a couple years older and people start to rely on you to get work done unrelated to your classes, that schedule simply won\u2019t work. No sane person working at a large company responds to emails at 2 in the morning. My suggestion is to wake up by 7 am. That way you can do your morning routine, check emails and perform other chores and housekeeping items, and be ready to start the day by 9 am. If you like to work out in the morning, then 6 am, or even 5:30 am is your wake-up time. That brings me to my next point\u2026\n\n2.\tHaving your own room is extremely underrated. I understand the concept of roommates for the social aspect when you first get to college, but honestly everyone just wants to be on their own sleep schedule and have their own space. You\u2019re going to be so happy once you have your first off campus apartment/room in a house.\n\n3.\tThere are good and bad professors in every department. There are 3 main variables that will dictate your opinion of a professor. Research experience, quality of teaching, and leniency. Most professors at Binghamton University are required to actively participate in research unless their title is \u201clecturer.\u201d This title is generally given to professors who teach several large sections of intro level courses. Their days are spent organizing classes, reviewing material and PowerPoints, communicating with students and other faculty, and grading. They do not have time to manage a lab. Many professors who focus on research don\u2019t practice teaching classes enough to be outstanding instructors (there are quite a few research professor who are notoriously amazing at teaching classes). The university doesn't care that you care unless the professor does something truly horrible. If they get students through the course and keep getting grant money then no one will be complaining besides you and your classmates. That brings me to the third variable, leniency. Some professors assign many online homework problems and quizzes. They tend to teach intro level/mid level courses and are very strict with deadlines. They won\u2019t budge if you ask for an extension. They\u2019re the ones that say \u201cmy syllabus is a contract and those were the deadlines.\u201d Other professors wouldn\u2019t care if you handed all your assignments in a couple weeks before finals. They generally encourage hand-written work and only assign a couple exams. I once had a class with \u201csuggested deadlines.\u201d I had another class that had \u201copen internet\u201d exams. \n\n4.\tThat brings me to the topic of classes. Intro level courses are easy but very tedious and time consuming. They\u2019re not meant to weed out unintelligent students. They\u2019re meant to weed out students who can\u2019t handle the stress and frustration of a collegiate STEM experience. A passion for a certain field doesn\u2019t equate to passion for a degree in that field. You might be the smartest person in the room. You might be that one kid who did crazy experiments in their basement and won awards at science fairs. But if you hate working on someone else\u2019s schedule (your professor\u2019s), get stressed easily, or love to learn on your own, then you\u2019re going to have a really tough time pursuing a STEM degree in college. It\u2019s not impossible. You\u2019ll just hate the experience and can\u2019t wait until you get into industry.\n\n5.\tThat insanely cool project you did in high school which won you first place at your science fair? Good luck doing it in college as a sanctioned activity. The university is concerned about their own liability as it relates to your activities as soon as you become a student. They\u2019d be perfectly happy if you just sat in lectures, wrote lab reports for classes, joined a professor\u2019s research group, got your degree and left. But the moment you ask the university for approval and support to do something that doesn\u2019t have a precedent, you\u2019ll start raising red flags. There\u2019s a reason why we don\u2019t have a skydiving team or send students to the Reno air races. Anything that presents some level of risk, even if it\u2019s generally safe and you can legally do it as a private citizen or a commercial entirety, raises a lot of red flags since the school doesn\u2019t want to deal with that level of liability.\n\n6.\tWith that being said, I strongly encourage you to get involved in a massive project or hobby outside of classes. I\u2019m not talking about student orgs that only meet a couple times a month. I personally became a pilot, joined a fraternity, and started a research group with some of my friends. All these processes were extremely difficult but worth every minute of my time. You need something outside of class to keep you occupied, not just Netflix. I changed my entire career path because of one of these activities (you can probably guess which).\n\n7.\tStudying abroad might be one of the best decisions you make in college. I personally chose the Antarctica program managed through SUNY Brockport. I won\u2019t go too much in depth since you can easily look it up online, but feel free to message me for more info. To make a long story short, it had a dramatic impact on my life, and I can\u2019t imagine going anywhere else for a study abroad program. \n\n8.\tDon\u2019t expect study abroad to advance your degree that much, especially if you\u2019re a STEM major. Most programs are geared towards humanities and softer STEM fields (think archaeology, politics, sociology, geology, etc). That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t STEM programs. They just don\u2019t tend to transfer to your degree that well. \n\n9.\tTry to get your gen eds done as soon as possible. Find a course sequence that you really like and get good grades in it. Use that sequence as a GPA booster if your major is stressful AF. Maybe get a minor? I took CINE 121 as a gen ed and ended up loving the class. I took a few more cinema courses throughout college, and they really helped my GPA.\n\n10.\tI wouldn\u2019t recommend taking a summer or winter class unless you failed that specific course and don\u2019t have time during the semester to retake it. Part time tuition is very expensive, especially for out of state students. For an out state student wanting to take a 4 credit course as a part time student, it costs as much as laser eye surgery. I'm not kidding. That tuition rate spiked for multiple SUNY schools last winter. You\u2019d be saving your money and sanity by taking it during the semester. In fact, it might be worth taking the class at your community college so you wouldn\u2019t have to be in Bing off semester. Summer/winter courses are inherently compressed and are full time commitments. You should take the opportunity that breaks afford to search for jobs, participate in internships, study abroad or travel, spend time with family, etc.\n\n11.\tSome people say GPA doesn\u2019t matter, and others say it\u2019s very important. In truth, both are correct and it really just depends on your circumstances. If you want to pursue an advanced degree in a hard STEM field closely related to your major at a \u201cprestigious\u201d university, then GPA will be very important. These programs often require a 3.2 or higher. If you want to pursue a more \u201ccareer oriented\u201d degree after undergrad (think biotech, space studies, management, cybersecurity, etc), then your experience and interest will generally weigh more heavily than grades. Intro level post-undergrad jobs will consider or at least ask for your GPA, but once you have some experience then other employers won\u2019t care about your college records.\n\n12.\tYou don\u2019t have to make friends with every single professor you meet. Finding 2 or 3 professors to become your mentors will usually suffice. One of my instructors from freshman year became my mentor and has written nearly a dozen letters of rec for multiple jobs, scholarships, grad schools, etc. It\u2019s also important to establish connections with your managers and employers at internships.\n\n13.\tDon\u2019t underestimate the importance of your physical, mental, and emotional health in college. I\u2019m no doctor, but you\u2019re at a time in your life when underlying diseases and conditions can still manifest themselves. Combine that with the fact that you\u2019re going to be in close proximity with people from all over the world, then mix in the obvious stresses of academics\u2026you get the point. Please don\u2019t forget to visit a primary care physician. Even better, use one close to home, not in Binghamton. Just make sure to schedule appointments off semester.\n\n14.\tEveryone loves to talk about the resources you can use if you\u2019re stressed, depressed, or otherwise concerned for your mental health. But no one likes discussing the offensive approach to mental health. Ask yourself: do I really need 18 credits per semester? (The answer is no). Do I understand the requirements for this major? Should I really schedule two labs in one day? (The answer is no). Should I spend money during the summers to get ahead and graduate a semester early? (The answer should be no. You should be relaxing or working). Every decision you make in college should be supported by risk assessment, because the better your decisions the better your mental health will be. Risk assessment is an extremely underrated skill that should be learned early in life.\n\n15.\tEntry level, non-engineering STEM jobs don\u2019t pay very well unless you have a master\u2019s degree.\n\n16.\tThoroughly research landlords before you sign a lease. Read EVERY SINGLE WORD on the lease before you sign, and negotiate before writing your signature. Several individuals around Binghamton have received the lovely nickname of \u201cslumlord\u201d due to their notoriously awful relationship with students. Time is money. You don\u2019t want to spend hours arguing with someone just to get nowhere.\n\n17.\tDo not lose any college transcripts that you received in high school. Some grad programs will want official transcripts from \u201call colleges that you have attempted credit at,\u201d even if the credits transferred to Binghamton. This generally includes certification courses that you took in high school and received credit for.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of more points to add, but these are just my initial thoughts. I\u2019ll edit as I think of others. If you want to add any points or debate anything that I discussed, comment below!\n\nEDIT. 18. The winters here are no joke. If you plan on bringing your car to campus after freshman year, be prepared to spend a little more on maintenance than you're used to. Don't park under trees if you can avoid it. Many off campus homes in Bing have a parking lot in their backyard with vegetation overhead. Don't be surprised if you find a few scratches on your car after the winter season from all the snow and ice you had to remove. The roads in downtown Bing are very rough. I've had my fair share of flat tires, alignment issues, etc. Nothing too serious, but that's just the reality of owning a vehicle in a region like this.\n\nEDIT. 19. The Organic Chemistry Tutor YouTube channel has a video for pretty much every non engineering STEM intro course. He explains things very methodically and has a ton of practice problems. Highly recommend.",

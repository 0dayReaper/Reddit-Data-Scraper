I don't feel like coming back for the spring one lol. \n\nI assumed there was but then i saw on the website there wasn't, but i'm certain i've heard of one in the fall (december) before. Thanks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nf86a7mmdwxa1.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e74f99ef54a33d7b852cc40ff802cebd5d113cf5",

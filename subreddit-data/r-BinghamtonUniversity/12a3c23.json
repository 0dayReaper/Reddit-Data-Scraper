    "postText": "Hello, I was recently admitted to bing for the fall semester (Class of 27) and applied for Biology. However, my interests have shifted recently, and I want to major in Computer Science. Is this an easy change? Any Advice? I have mediocre math grades but I got 100 in APCSA last semester and most likely this one.",

            "comment": "Not an easy change because you would need do complete an IUT (intra university transfer) which is very competitive esp for cs, and to even apply for a cs iut you need to take some cs prereq classes which are a pain to get into if you aren\u2019t already a cs major, so it is possible (only if you get on top of things immediately) but very difficult\n\nAn alternative option is to stay at bing for a couple years doing gen eds and pre reqs and ideally getting a good gpa which would allow you to apply to transfer, this is good for a couple reasons:\n1. You have a clear reason for transferring (you want to do cs)\n2. You might be able to transfer into a better school (i was accepted to nyu with a 3.67 after my freshman yr at bing, but i chose to stay at bing)",

            "comment": "I would reach out to the Admissions office/Watson and see what they about say changing. You'd be going from a Harpur student to a Watson student. If you do decide to come here in Harpur but still want to pursue CS (which only Watson students can do), you would have to do what's called an \"intra university transfer\" (IUT) into Watson, which isn't recommended as CS is highly competitive and they select 3 IUT students a year to get accepted. If you truly want to do CS and Watson doesn't let you re-apply for their program, it may be best to go somewhere else.",

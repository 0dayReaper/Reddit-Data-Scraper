    "postText": "Looking for off campus housing area recommendations as incoming student looking preparing for next semester. I've seen posts which landlords, management, or LLC to avoid. But what about the area, which area is good for commute without personal car, close to bus line, not too far from school, grocery and everything. \n\nI heard south of Main st. is recommended, which city? Avoid Johnson City? Southside? Vestal? Westside? Endwell?\n\nThank you!!",

Only additional thing you would have to pay for is internet.\n\nIf interested please DM me and I will tell you more. (Soory, trying not to do myself too much on here...)",

You can see the route guide [here](https://www.occtransport.org/destination-and-route-guide), look at the MS IN/OUT, WS IN/OUT, and DCL IN/OUT.\n\nMost students live in that area as well. Johnson City and Endwell are not serviced by bus, and the Southside bus does not run as frequently.",

Obviously Geneseo is a better school for education, but Im really not a fan about anything else about the school/campus/community especially compared to Binghamton. I\u2019m just wondering if the education program at Binghamton is comparable to Geneseo",

There are more school districts in the area than in Geneseo, which will give you more opportunities for professional experience. The Romance Language departments are obviously small and have limited elective offerings but I found the French professors to be excellent. Can't speak to Spanish though.",

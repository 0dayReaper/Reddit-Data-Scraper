Its in a smaller city, its a smaller student population, and overall a bit more \"personal\" in overall feel.\n\nBuffalo is absolutely larger overall. More programs, more students, more city, more to do. Definitely a bit more of a feeling of being \"awash\" in the school and city. You likely wont feel like youve seen everyone or everything by the time you graduate.\n\n\nIm trying to stay as \"adjective-neutral\" as I can, because each person will see these facts a bit differently.Just depends on what you want. Feel free to PM me if you have more specific questions",

Not massive but a lot to do if you like partying. \n\nI\u2019m also a business major so Binghamton made a lot more sense. Overall I thought Binghamtons campus was better looking and they are less prone to massive amount of snow if that\u2019s a factor. \n\nThe food is equal at both colleges in my opinion. I think Bing has a few more options though. \n\nClasses at Bing are hit or miss, but definitely a lot more hits than misses. \n\nIf you have any other questions on my I choose Bing let me know. I did some very in depth research.",

Maybe I was there during an off season. \n\nHowever, I didn\u2019t like being so far from home (800+ miles, compared to 175 for Binghamton), I was paying 55k a year to be there compared to 23k a year here. The schools are ranked similarly for what I\u2019m doing (MIS and Comp Sci). \n\nSocially though everyone there seems to be part of Greek life which I tried (and got a few bids) but wasn\u2019t a fan of. 90% of the people also are from Georgia (which makes sense) and come with people and friends from there high school so I had a very intense feeling of not fitting in and being the odd one out. \n\nThat\u2019s my reasons. Here I have a better support network, enjoy my classes more, and overall feel more at \u201chome\u201d.",

Honestly I have never heard of UGA being strong in MIS and Comp Science, and could not speak to Binghamton as I have not lived there in decades. In a Georgia we think GA Tech for that.\n\nIt sounds like you are from the City/Long Island and that is a huge culture clash with the South.  Yes, Greek life and football and bars by the dozen dominate the UGA social scene.  The music scene is slowly fading/dying because they cannot afford to live here any more.\n\nWhat you may not have realized not being here that long is that I think of Athens as Binghamton South.  Similar economies with the State University being the biggest economic driver.  There are also so many people living here from the Triple Cities.  One of the downtown bars is owned by Endicott natives.  The Band Five-Eight actually started in Binghamton and is made up if guys from Binghamton or went to SUNY-B!\n\nAnd here is a deep, not so dark secret about total cost of attendance at UGA for in-state students:  if you are in the middle class with some savings it is not affordable, even if you have the Zell Miller Scholarship.  There is no other merit based aid and the only thing you get offered are in subsidized student and parent loans.  It is actually cheaper for top students to go to neighboring states\u2019 schools and private schools that are generous with non-loan aid.\n\nBest of luck to you and Go Dawgs!",

I\u2019m still paying 27k a year here, all loans which sucks. \n\nBut seriously, athens was great and UGA I\u2019m sure would be amazing if I lived in Georgia.",

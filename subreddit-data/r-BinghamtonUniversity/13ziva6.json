And if you're a student, of course you have access to your respective areas. Maybe we'll see each other xD.\n\nNext would be bartle basement. I've holed up in the old cs computer labs down there across from the old testing center next to the staircase in front of jazzmans.\n\nI've also stayed in the union basement a few times as well.\n\nJanitors will pass by and typically say nothing.\n\nIF you get locked out of these buildings at any point and time and cannot access your stuff (literally did it today going to the bathroom)-  contact upd and tell them you were studying and got locked. Always bring a book or a laptop to where you are so they don't bother you.\n\nBring a drink, snacks, and a blanket. It gets a bit chilly and I promise that will will get hungry and thirsty.",

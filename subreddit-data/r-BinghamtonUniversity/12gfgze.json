            "comment": "My state school is Rutgers and I personally chose Bing SOM over it and it was the best decision ever. The school is wayyyyy smaller so they really know how to focus on you and ensure everyone they produce is amazing and doesn\u2019t get lost. Also, they have stronger connections with big firms that will lead you directly to a job/internship in the city at the end. For reference, a lot of SOM clubs get involved with the big 4 on the daily on campus and in the city so you\u2019re constantly networking. Bing also offered a more competitive setting rather than Rutgers where nearly everyone gets in. Hence, at bing you know the people around you are very driven and bright, but are also nice enough to help you out. As im finishing my first year, I can truly say SOM made it amazing with all their programs and information available. If you want more details feel free to message me and congrats!!! :))",

            "comment": "There's not enough background information to give a proper advice for this. What specifically do you want to major in (or concentrate in)? Accounting? Finance? MIS? Business Analytics? The most common concentrations you will see on campus are students studying either accounting, finance, or mis.\n\nIf your answer is accounting, then I would say Bing is a very solid choice. Once you're on campus, you will notice that A LOT of the resources the university offers are targeted towards accounting students. This includes the firms that come to campus, ranging from small to large accounting firms. The school even has various honors programs as well that are pretty prestigious at the school (despite being a lot of work) called PWC Scholars and EY Student Leaders (very new) that you can apply into.\n\nIf your answer is finance, then the answer is a bit different. As a finance student, I would say that the student organizations are definitely what makes this school special. Many of the som orgs are impressive and have highly motivated students, especially the investment fund. One of the only ways to get into banking will be through that investment fund pipeline and using student resources to secure an internship or a job. This is because bing is not a target for banking, and you will need to do your fair share of work to stand out to recruiters. There are two main programs that finance students will strive for on campus, which are a Jefferies program and a Zurack program (both set you up pretty well). However, I have noticed the school making significant strides in increasing its prospects for financial firms like Mizuho coming to campus. But the majority of the time, Career Week events will be dominated by employers looking for accounting students, and will be uninterested in finance students (other than the events hosted by Finance Society).\n\nIf your answer is mis, I honestly don't know much about it. Many students usually choose to take an MIS concentration as a supplement to another concentration.\n\nUltimately, if you're deciding to major in accounting or finance, there are things you need to consider. If you're deciding to major in anything else in business, then I would say Rutgers 100% (I'm assuming you're talking about Rutgers - New Brunswick). It is also important to note that Bing only offers an Accounting and Business Administration degree, with other specializations only counting as a concentration.",

It would appear Binghamton SOM ranks #3 among public schools for finance salaries, and Rutgers NB ranks #7. Thought you might want to take a look. Don't know how much weight you put on online rankings, but Binghamton is ranked marginally better for finance. Since they both cost the same for you, I would say choose whichever one you like better.",

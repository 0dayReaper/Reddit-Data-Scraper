PSYC is more flexible and \"easier\" in comparison from what I've heard from students. \n\nKeep in mind that some of the intro BIOL courses are \"weed out,\" classes, meaning that they may be intentionally hard to dissuade students. I also haven't heard great things about some of the professors for those courses, which can add to the difficulty.\n\nI'm not sure what your standing is, but if it's still early in your career, I suggest making a Fall 2023 schedule that would fulfill requirements of two+ majors, so that you are on track for whichever one you choose. Another tip is that you may have an easier time in courses/a major you're more interested in.\n\nEDIT: I would like to add that I did poorly in two of the core courses for my major in undergrad (I did PPL). However, this did not stop me from pursuing the major, because I knew it was right for me and I did well in all of the other courses. Don't get discouraged if you don't do as well as you hoped in one of your major courses.",

But remember that it\u2019s in your own hands to build a network with faculty, other students, professors, etc. The School of Management by itself is good, but you can make it great by joining clubs that connect you with professionals both inside and outside of the SOM network",

            "comment": "I graduated from SOM back in 2012, so take this all with a grain of salt.\n\nSOM has a really strong accounting program. Folks who joined the PwC Scholars program and generally did well ended up getting placed at the big accounting firms in NYC. From what I heard, if you weren't in those special sponsored programs, it was significantly harder to get a job at the big accounting firms after graduation.\n\nThat said, accountants are pretty in-demand, and it's a good school. You might not get a name-brand job after graduation, but SOM accountants should be able to get decent jobs, even if you're not in those programs.\n\nFinance majors did the next best. I myself majored in finance but didn't feel a passion for it, and got middling grades (graduated with a 3.33 GPA if I recall correctly). I did get some interviews with financial firms, none of them huge, and landed what I considered a good job at a larger advertising firm after interviewing with about a dozen different companies. I work in tech now, so I've completely drifted away from finance.\n\nMarketing and other majors did OK, but I don't recall most folks getting insane consulting / finance jobs after graduation.",

I didn't fully leverage the career resources available at SOM, nor did I actively network or begin job hunting until April. Despite this, I got a desirable position at a major financial services firm, making $50k with a hybrid working schedule (one week on-site, three weeks remote) near Providence, RI. This is low compared to my peers in corporate finance or at the big 4, who average $60-70k. However, this was the kind of job that I wanted, and its paying above average for its type of role",

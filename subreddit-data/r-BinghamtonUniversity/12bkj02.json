They are not getting a raise because they aren\u2019t funded by the university, they\u2019re funded by the Research Foundation, and their contracts are set by their PI.\n\nPersonally, I am covered by this raise, and I\u2019m thankful for it \u2026 even while I\u2019m aware that many of my brothers and sisters aren\u2019t covered and are intentionally skipping meals or healthcare in order to make ends meet.",

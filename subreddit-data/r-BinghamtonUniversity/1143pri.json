            "comment": "It works similarly to you first came into the university. You sign the lease/housing agreement, form your group, and select your room based on your priority.\n\nIf you want the best chances of moving into Mountainview, it's best to have at least 1 person already in to bring others into the community. This ensures you get the earliest Priority possible for most people which is Priority 7. You can find the full process detailed [here](https://www.binghamton.edu/residential-life/housing/returning/index.html) but the gist of the priorities for the Dorms (Apartments use Priorities 1-4) is:\n\nPriority 5: Same group in the same room/suite/flat\n\nPriority 6: Same group moving in the same community\n\nPriority 7: Bringing people into your community\n\nPriority 8: Group moves anywhere on campus\n\nPriority 9: Anyone goes anywhere\n\nAll but Priority 9 are fill-priorities, meaning that you need to fill the entire room, suite, or flat to claim it. If you're filling a 6-person suite, your group needs to have 6 people. Priority 9 is the open priority which drops this requirement but you're also left with the table scraps of what's left",

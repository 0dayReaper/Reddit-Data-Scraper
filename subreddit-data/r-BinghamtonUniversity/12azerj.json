There\u2019s probably a dozen schools where the name recognition matters to corporate America. Neither of these schools are presently one of them unless you are being interviewed by an alumnus/alumnae.\n2. \u201cPopular amongst Indian students\u201d is a terrible reason to choose **any** school unless you are an Indian student without any personal preferences, unique goals, or individual personality. If _the only thing that matters to you_ is being surrounded by a lot of Indians, don\u2019t do any research and just apply to the one that has more Indians (GMU, by about a hundred). Or better yet, stay in India as there will be countless Indians in your program in that case. But I suspect you aren\u2019t \u201cjust another Indian student\u201d. So what matters to **you**?\n3. Don\u2019t trust the rankings at all. They are filled with fraud and misinformation. The only ranking that is hard-data focused and maybe matters to you is the Carnegie Research Classification \u2026 and in that case only if you see yourself getting a research-based degree at that school.\n\n- [Columbia whistleblower on exposing college rankings: \u2018They are worthless\u2019](https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/16/columbia-whistleblower-us-news-rankings-michael-thaddeus)\n- [USC and 2U Sued for Alleged U.S. News Rankings Fraud](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/usc-sued-for-alleged-us-news-rankings-fraud/)",

I\u2019ve had LED strips up during inspections and it\u2019s been fine. They\u2019re a lot more strict about flags, tapestries, and curtains tho. You will get a notice to take those down. \n\nOtherwise, just know that you will receive a warning and time to fix the violations before getting fined.",

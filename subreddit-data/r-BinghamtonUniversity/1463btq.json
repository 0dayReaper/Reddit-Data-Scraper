            "comment": "I was in the biogeochem stream and I absolutely loved it! The professor, Dr. Schmitkons is great. The stream is really like applied environmental science but there\u2019s aspects from geology, biology and chemistry. My group and I researched ancient ocean sediments and what they could tell us about past climates. A lot of the other streams did projects about watershed chemistry or researching lakes. If you like environmental science, biology, Chem or geology you\u2019ll definitely be able to find a project that interests you! Feel free to message me with any questions.",

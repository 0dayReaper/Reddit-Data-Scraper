Since this is a big jump from their 2021 starting salary, do you guys think it is accurate? If so, what do you guys think allowed for this improvement? How are the opportunities for the accounting and finance students?",

SOM career services are rly great and there\u2019s s lot of resources, you should have no issue getting a job at a midsize or big 4 firm before or post graduation. Not sure about finance bc I\u2019m an accounting major but should be pretty similar",

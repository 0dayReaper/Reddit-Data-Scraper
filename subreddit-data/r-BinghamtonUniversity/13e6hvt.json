    "postText": "So, I\u2019m a transfer student coming in this fall and I\u2019m currently making a schedule so when I can actually schedule classes I don\u2019t waste time. But the thing is, most if not all of the classes I need are already taken up, and I\u2019m not even able to schedule classes till around June 16th, maybe even later. This is really stressing me out as I\u2019m also switching majors where I need to take a bunch of prerequisites that aren\u2019t even open right now. Does anyone have any advice? Do you think I\u2019d be able to email professors and ask them to open one more spot? Do you think they\u2019ll be opening more classes? \n\nAlso, why do some classes have insanely awkward schedules? For MATH226, there\u2019s only classes schedule from like week 7 to week 9, and 5 classes each week. Also, is it normal for physics classes to be 5 days a week with 3 classes each day? Because that\u2019s also the only physics class open (phys131) and it really makes it so I can\u2019t schedule most other classes. This is just insanity to me and stresses me out because I\u2019m already behind as a transfer student, changing majors, and now I might have to waste another whole semester\n\nEdit: thank you all for the advice and info! If anyone has any knowledge on the physics class though that would be helpful, because I feel like even for physics it\u2019s extreme to have 3 classes a day, 5 days a week",

We\u2019re all under end of semester crush. At minimum, wait until after the 18th, when grades finalize and all have to be entered. To be honest though, I\u2019m not even thinking about fall semester yet.\n\nAs for \u201copening up one more spot\u201d, overloading class capacity is handled on a department by department basis. Do you know who your advisor is? You really ought to speak to them. If you don\u2019t know who your advisor is, what college/major are you transferring into?",

The Calc classes are \"unique\" in the sense that each class (MATH 224 as an example) is only 2 credits, and they run for half of a semester. HOWEVER, you must register for them as paired courses, meaning you cannot take MATH 224 without MATH 225, cannot take MATH 226 without 227, etc (there are some exceptions to this rule but unless you have previous transfer credit for any of these then said exceptions would not apply to you). Since you need to register for both at the same time, this creates one 4 credit course.",

CS courses are a little harder to get into, so for your first semester, I'd say you'd probably be looking at CHEM and potentially MATH, or you could maybe do PHYS and MATH, etc. \n\nAs long as you're getting into some prereqs., I don't think you'll be behind by any means, but I would definitely speak with Watson advising on this if you haven't already, because your standing may affect when you have to have certain courses done by.",

Worst case scenario, if you don't get in,  there may be other pathways for you to get the type of experience you want as a Harpur student. There's a computer science minor housed in Watson that you can apply to, you don't need to IUT for it (I'm sure it's still competitive, but the option is there). I believe there's an engineering minor as well.\n\nAnother option would maybe be a PHYS major and MATH minor combo. We also have a CS-ish style major in Harpur called Digital and Data Studies (DIDA) that has Python and other coding courses in it. \n\nEven another option besides these is that Watson offers these sort of \"continuing education\" certification courses that allow you to learn certain skills. They're not a regular class really, more so something you register for on your own time. I know they have a lot of intro courses so if you already have CS experience these may be too easy for you, but they are planning on adding new stuff: https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/continuing-education/index.html",

For a majority of the 'major' classes, you can't register for them unless you are in that school. For almost all CS classes you generally need permission to enroll from the department head. I believe, but am not sure, that CS110 is the exception.\n\nIf you want to do Engineering or CS, you will have to Intra-university Transfer to Watson. Please refer to this webpage for info: [https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/current/iut-watson.html](https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/current/iut-watson.html)\n\nI have multiple friends who went through the process of IUT and it is extremely competitive. While the 'baseline' GPA may be 3.0/3.2/3.5, the people who get in tend to have a 3.7/3.8 overall gpa and prerequisite gpa. You must take certain prerequisites to be considered, which are on the web-page. It is no easy task, so make sure to do well in these prerequisite classes to be considered. \n\nIf you have any questions I can do my best to answer!",

Many professors only come to campus on days they teach, especially because many commute from outside Binghamton.\n\nThe 14th is the last contractual day (so emails, committee work, etc ) but most will respond to queries over the summer just expect a delay. Most use their Binghamton email addresses for research, publications and conferences (which they\u2019re expected to do over the summer) so they\u2019ll definitely see your email, they just might not prioritize it.",

    "postText": " \n\nHi guys, \n\nI am an incoming freshman and will be starting my studies at Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in the upcoming fall semester. I have a question regarding the process of switching majors within the school.\n\nAs of now, I have been admitted as an engineering major, but I am considering switching my major to computer science. Before making a final decision, I would like to gather more information about the feasibility and process of switching majors within Watson School, particularly from engineering to computer science.\n\nI understand that switching majors is a significant decision, and I want to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the steps involved, any specific requirements, and the overall difficulty of the process. It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide me with guidance and insights on the following:\n\n1. Are there any specific prerequisites or criteria for switching from an engineering major to computer science within Watson School?\n2. What is the typical process for requesting a major change before starting the first semester of freshmen year?\n3. Are there any limitations or considerations I should be aware of when switching majors within the school?\n4. How competitive is the process of switching into the computer science program?",

            "comment": "Not sure how it is as of recent, but our computer science program keeps pretty much everything completely separate from all the other majors in Watson. Transferring from one engineering to another in the Watson school is usually very easy, especially during your first year since all engineering majors have a common first year. However, Computer science is known to have much tighter class sizes where they have very few open seats for transfers. It may be early enough for them to work with you though. I\u2019d suggest reaching out to the CS department or the Watson school to see if they\u2019d let you switch before the semester starts. After the semester starts, it is difficult to transfer in, but it can happen. It\u2019s certainly easier since you are already in the Watson school, but the CS department makes things difficult for everyone. If your do end up starting as an engineering major and switching to CS later on (like a year or so), make sure you keep your grades as high as possible. It\u2019ll be way harder to convince them to let you into the program if your gpa is lower than a 3.5",

If you weren\u2019t in Watson, you would need to apply to transfer, but I believe Watson students can change their major with some administrative work. Not sure though.\n\nYou should contact the watson advising office and ask if it is possible.",

It is competitive for people OUTSIDE of Watson to switch to a program within. I took engineering classes my freshman fall sem then cs spring sem, the classes I took while in engineering count towards cs (calc 1, calc 2, and my elective) If you have any questions you can dm me!",

This is something people don't talk about at all. I did a programming class in high school and fell in love with it, so I chose CS. However, CS, espcially at bing, is extrodinarily hard and you probably won't like your grades lol. It's 70% thinking and 30% programming. So if mulling over notes and code for hours and doing nearly 70% of a math degree(literally) isn't appealing to you, I don't recommend. \n\n\\-People on here are talking about eileen and prof lewis. They are both incredible people and have helped me through some very rough times and I'm extremely close with each. The CS program is designed to keep people out. On average, only about 10-20% of the original class graduates. Keep this in mind.\n\n1. since you're a freshman, there's not really any prqreqs that you can fulfilll? I recommend personally visiting Prof Lewis when you have time and explain your mixup (he probably won't believe you, knowing him). CS classes are typically guarded so that non cs majors can't join them. I would ask for a chance to do CS110 and CS101 for a chance to prove that you can do the major. I'd do thse along with some high level math classes (calc 2 if you don't have already, linear algebra, calc 3, number systems). If he agrees, he might set you up on the cs track, keep track of your progress and maybe after 2 or 3 semesters, let you join. Schmoozing up to him is your best way in imo.\n2. can't just \"request\" a major change into cs. not the way it works. need to be personally approved by the dept.\n3. personally, I'd do what I mentioned in 1. alongside your engineering classes. If you make it, your engineering classes will not be wasted - they'll file under your free classes.  if not, you might be able to get a cs minor - much easier and highly recommend. \n4. Extremely -  Eileen has spefically stated that it's designed so that most people don't make it. However, even though it's a little soul crushing, the program is incredible and will really shape the way that you think when you go on in the future. I've learned so much (and have had to retake multiple classes). And you'll be well setup to get a job after graduation.",

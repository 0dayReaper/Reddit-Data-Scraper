The classes can be hit or miss but there are defintely some interesting ones that you still get gen Ed credit for and there's a couple of fun events each semester like hikes, sports games,  formals. Ultimately there's nothing forcing you to stay in the program so I'd say it couldn't hurt to try",

As an mechanical engineering major, the scholars classes kind of took up the free slots I had in my schedule making it hard to do gen-Ed\u2019s or doing a minor. But if your another major than maybe it won\u2019t effect your schedule that bad. Also your forced to live in Newing with a roommate in freshman year. If it were me I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend the Scholars Program, but it\u2019s up to you.",

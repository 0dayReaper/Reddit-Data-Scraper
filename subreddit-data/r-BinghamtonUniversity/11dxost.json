Then flip a coin.\n\nFwiw I took Calc 2 asynchronously at Jamestown Community College and found it relatively easygoing compared to Bing. That's the only thing I can vouch for though\n\n[What Coursework Transfers?](https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/coursework.html)",

Jamestown contacted me to say they don't participate in summer cross-registration, but they enrolled me anyway. I dunno how to apply the \"right\" way, but you can probably try that lol. Use the [SUNY Jamestown schedule of classes](https://www.sunyjcc.edu/courses/sections/search?query=) to find out the course name/section/code that you're registering for.\n\nAs for cost, the class was $955, including all fees, when I took it. I didn't get to use my financial aid. Not sure if the cost may have gone up since then. For some reason I got billed at both Binghamton and at Jamestown, but I only had to pay Jamestown. Had to call Bing to get their bill dropped. Just warning because this very well may happen to you.\n\nBe aware that the school won't send your final grades back to Binghamton unless you pay extra for it. I think $10 or something. You have to make sure you order a copy of your Jamestown transcript to be sent to Bing when grades are posted.",

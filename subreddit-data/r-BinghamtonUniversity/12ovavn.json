If you\u2019re fine with living in an older building and can make sacrifices, Hinman and CIW are typically a lot more social. Honestly tho the best way to learn about the dorms is to just go to the Binghamton university reslife website",

People also reccomended Newing the most. I visited on saturday, and the only place I actually went inside was Hinman, and it seemed like it had a solid dining hall and decent housing. Newing is at the top of my list but I havent fillled out the app yet because I cant figure out how to activate my bmail",

            "comment": "to add on to what other people were mentioning it also depends on the vibe you want. newing is pretty social and there's a lot of party people and it's very active at nights (music playing, people pregaming between dorms, lots of people having doors open). dickinson is similar but it's suite living so some people tend to stay in their room. i feel like hinman and ciw are more chill and there of course people who party and are social but i feel like you would have plenty of people who enjoy quieter living. mountain view is a great mix of both but from my personal experience people tend to also stay towards their suite.",

            "comment": "You should also consider how far you want to walk to classes, since Newing is the farthest with Hinman being one of the closest. \n\nAlso, think about how you would feel just having that place as a living space. Are you okay sharing one shower with 5 other people in Newing? Are you willing to put up with loud noises, or do you want a quiet living community? How do you feel about the smell of weed, like in CIW or Hinman (though many dorms smell). This kind of stuff is important as well since you need to sleep, study, and shower in this dorm.",

From personal experience, Newing always has people awake and making noise at 2 am, and it\u2019s worse on the weekends or holidays when they go out till the morning. But it can be quiet. Dickinson is more quiet, but as I type this someone is shouting on the floor above me for some reason, I\u2019m assuming because of football. As for the other dorms, you would need to ask someone else their experience.",

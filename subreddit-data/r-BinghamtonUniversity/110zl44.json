    "postText": " \n\nCovid took away half of jr yr and the whole senior yr. Boom I'm in college. I got admitted to the uni as a spring admit meaning I was already academically and socially behind. I was undecided on a major, and now I am a 2nd semester soph. I'm basically forced to choose, as I want to shorten my time in college and I'm almost halfway there. I'm thinking physics because I didn't click with psychology, geophysics, business, computer science, engineering. So now I am taking classes I should've taken earlier but couldn't because I had no idea what I want to do or was taking gen eds. In a nutshell, a lot of time was wasted because I didn't know what I wanted to do.\n\nIt seems like others are already on track and have no issues with their major. People are already applying to jobs, internships, and it seems like they got their shit together.\n\nMeanwhile I have zero interest in studying I cant pay attention for shit. I hate studying and trying to remember material enough to get a grade that maintains my gpa. Because I hate studying, I got in too many extracurriculars that just takes my study time away. I got involved in 5 sports things and more clubs. Sort of like an automatic defense mechanism and instant gratification. In pursuing pleasure now, I take away pleasure from myself in the future. I cant stop. I planned to study my ass of this weekend but guess what i went on a losing streak in both league and valorant\n\nI dont study&gt;grades bad&gt;less opportunities and offers&gt; no job&gt;no income&gt;i cant do anything i like&gt;cant help my family&gt;utter failure&gt;yk what happens next\n\nMy gpa is 3.27 and I have to get around Bs in all my classes which is super hard. And as a potential physics major its just not looking good. As for hobbies that may make me money. I know how to do a lot of things but none of them super well. So my hobbies basically wont take me anywhere.\n\nMy first tests are coming up and already I feel so defeated. Writing this rant actually makes me feel worse. Like wtf am i doing instead of studying for the calc test, i give up\n\nIm pessimistic, I avoid responsibility fully knowing the consequences, I keep living the unhealthy mindset, I cant focus. Funny thing is I know the solution to everything. I just cant act on it. Im grateful for the opportunity to attend uni and having my parents pay for most things. So now on top of all this theres guilt as well, the \"i cant let my family down\"\n\nIm not thinking about killing myself but I will welcome death and thats just a horrible way of living\n\nIm taking calc3 and had to look up cos30 and the antiderivative of 2x\n\nThe get money fast business tiktoks are fake right XD",

The majority of the people who I have worked with in that time either switched majors or majored in something completely unrelated to what they are doing today.  When we interview, grades and degree are less important than experience and personality.\n\nIt's going to be nice out this week.  Take some time to sit in the sun and consider what your interests are.  It's ok not to know.  It's ok to switch.  It's ok to decide switch majors, take a break from school, drop classes, etc.  I was a bio major when I started school, but organic chemistry kicked my ass...so I dropped and switched majors.\n\nI highly recommend taking 1 elective outside your major and/or a PE class each semester.  It's good for your brain and looks good on the resume that you have other interests.",

That is an amazing achievement and one that most do not attain.\n\nYour college years are for figuring things out and exploring your options.  The people who think have everything together? They don't.  No one does.  Everyone struggles with what you are feeling at some point in their life. \n\nEveryone goes at THEIR own pace in life.  It doesn't make you less than because you are struggling right now.  It makes you human.\n\nBing has counseling services.  Look them up and sign up.  Speaking to someone who is unbiased and can help you sort out your options will help.  They will also help you figure out how to get things done and make a plan.\n\nTry to remember that sometimes days are darkest before the light.  You will get through this.  Hang in there because clear skys are ahead.  You can do this.",

I\u2019m also a second semester sophomore and I haven\u2019t even join clubs that could potentially propel me to something amazing and something wroth while.\n\nI ended taking a semester withdrawal in my freshman year after getting COVID and mental complications and I always felt that that was contradicting everything that I had done in the past that was positive.

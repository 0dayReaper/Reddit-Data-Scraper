I was lucky enough to have gotten the first time slot for dorm selection and I was wondering what the biggest/nicest dorms available are? Me and my roommate had chosen Chem free and gender neutral housing so idk if that will affect what room I can choose?",

If you want the *appearance* of a bigger dorm I reccomend getting a corner dorm which has 2 windows. So for example 501, 555 (501 definitely, but I'm not 100% sure if dorms go up to 55 or 54, but something like that).",

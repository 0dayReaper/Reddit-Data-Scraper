    "postText": "Just noticed that there are scratches left on the floor from my punk ass desk chair(why do they rock??) And now I'm stressing over it. I'll try to buff them out to the best of my ability but I'm still worried. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to make them unnoticeable? Will a sponge+water work or do I need to buy a special oil or smth? :((  \n\n\nMy room was in pretty musty condition before I got it, the damage left by people before me was left unfixed(some holes in the wall) but they were marked down in the damages form already.",

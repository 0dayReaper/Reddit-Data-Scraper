    "postText": "I already registered for classes but I am considering changing a class and looking at what it would be like in college scheduler. The issue the website is using my current schedule and registration cart and restricting the schedule based off of that info even though I have it unchecked. What I mean is it\u2019s saying I cannot create a schedule because the times conflict with the original schedule even though I am attempting to create a new one from scratch. It gives the error message that a course \u201cdoes not have any available options with the settings you have selected\u201d. Has anyone else run into this and does anyone know how to get rid of the registration cart and \u201ccurrent schedule\u201d from the Schedule Planner website?",

Do I send it to admissions or to my specific admissions counselor that I found through [this](https://www.binghamton.edu/admissions/contact/counselor.html) website? Thanks!",

I got an email back saying \u201cthe waitlist is completely random and if you get a spot you will be notified\u201d. So idk if that was bs or not but idrk how it works",

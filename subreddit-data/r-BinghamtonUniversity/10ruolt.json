    "postText": "I've been living off campus for the past 2 years, and I have one more year to go (Fall 2023/Spring 2024) left until I graduate. I've had a very difficult time making any friends here. I've tried clubs, but I either can't go because of my work schedule or they're usually not even remotely interesting (I've got 2 on my list I'm going to try this semester but I'm not holding my breath). I've also tried chatting a bit in class, but most people seem pretty shut off and any conversation usually never goes beyond basic chit-chat. Being 5-6 years older than everyone else here doesn't help much either; neither does being a transfer.\n\nI'm thinking maybe if I live on campus maybe I'll feel a bit more connected to the school in general and it would be easier to connect with people in my building; or maybe I'd end up being more miserable and this whole thing is a pipe dream. I'm very much flexible when it comes to living standards and I don't think I'd mind a small space/roommates as long as they aren't total slobs. Should I give on-campus a shot or should I just suck it up and muscle through my last year?",

            "comment": "Honestly, with you just having one year left I don't think you should live on campus. For a few reasons, dorm life is kind of annoying. Dealing with shitty internet, room checks, fire drills, annoying maintenance issues gets old. Also, you're not guaranteed to get along with your roommates and become friends. Obviously that's the goal but a lot of times people just live together. Also, since you'd probably be living in the apartments you should know people are pretty introverted and keep to themselves more so than any other community on campus. I think you're better off getting through your last year and moving onto better things.",

I get the feeling from some other people I've talked to that age would be a big issue, and frankly having been to some of the bars on State and being around all these people 5-6 years younger than me I think it might be difficult for me to connect with anybody I'd be rooming with. And yeah I've read plenty of stories about the dorms, and frankly my apartment isn't nearly that bad so maybe I should count my blessings lol.\n\nI guess I'll just keep on trying to socialize in any way I can. I just don't want to look back on these years with regret is all.",

I don\u2019t know if there are twentysomething social clubs here in Binghamton like there are in many cities, but you could definitely try meeting with the Southern Tier Young Professionals organization. They do both community service and social events. You can make friends who are closer to your age, and it would help with networking too. \n\nhttps://styp.org/about/",

Most of my friends lived on campus I was always off campus due to the cost. $1300 vs $350 monthly. \n\nSince it\u2019s your last year and money is not an issue you should stay on campus. This way you won\u2019t have regrets years later. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue.",

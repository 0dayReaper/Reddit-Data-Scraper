    "postText": "Greetings, Reddit community!\n\nI am a 17-year-old high school student from Canada, and ever since I was 15, I have been certain about my desire to become an entrepreneur. The driving force behind my passion is the exhilarating experience of tackling problems head-on and dedicating my thoughts solely to finding solutions. I have ADHD, and although I find it challenging to focus on uninteresting tasks, I enter a state of intense concentration when I'm engaged in something that captivates me. It's a deeply satisfying feeling.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to realize that entrepreneurship was my calling. At the age of 16, I also recognized a pattern in a country's growth and development. Typically, there are periods of conflict and numerous challenges before the nation gradually enters a more stable and progressive phase, resulting in exponential growth across various sectors. However, I felt discontented living in a highly competitive country where there were limited opportunities for creating something new, unlike countries that hadn't experienced rapid growth.\n\nThis led me to contemplate what I could do differently, and I had a realization. Since my parents and I are immigrants from Africa (I arrived at such a young age that I don't even remember my birth country), I became aware that although my original country is relatively stable now with no war, it still faces problems such as hunger, electricity shortages, and supply-demand imbalances. Additionally, I have an uncle who holds a significant position within the government.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I thought to myself, \"Why not leverage my circumstances to generate profit?\" I know that my father owns extensive plots of land, some of which are being developed into farms while others remain vast, empty spaces. Moreover, the cost of constructing houses or buildings in my birth country is substantially different from that in Canada.\n\nThis sparked the following ideas:\n\n1. As soon as I can manage it, I intend to work tirelessly for around 12 hours a day, taking on jobs like Ubering, DoorDashing, and remote work opportunities (given my language skills in English, Arabic, Turkish, and some Mandarin). By pushing myself to the limit and maximizing my earning potential, I believe I can generate a minimum annual income of $60,000. With that capital, I plan to construct a hotel or luxury homes within an affordable range. Furthermore, I intend to have a conversation with my uncle, exploring ways to operate more freely instead of being viewed solely as a foreign investor or an average citizen.\n\n2. Simultaneously, I aim to save money diligently and pursue a degree in electrical engineering, mastering the subject thoroughly. My goal is to establish a solar energy company that addresses the growing demand for electricity.\n\n3. My father possesses at least four plots of land spanning 10km to 15km, which he intended to convert into farms but hasn't taken action due to a lack of knowledge and motivation. These lands are exceptionally fertile. One of them is situated in an area where a city is currently under construction. I have the opportunity to purchase it from my father at a reasonable price and develop a farm for sale or export. Additionally, I could use another piece of land to construct apartment buildings within the same city. I'm also aware of Sudanese refugees and other individuals seeking homes in the area due to its convenience. Given that the region is predominantly occupied by my clan (which falls within a larger tribe), many clan members own land but lack the means to initiate projects. Consequently, numerous individuals are open to selling their land, providing me with potential investment opportunities.\n\n4. I'm open to suggestions and ideas. What other avenues could I explore to maximize my entrepreneurial endeavors ?\n\nI dont want to precise which country in africa it is but its somewhere between east , north and west africa. Its not congo or some other popular country",

            "comment": "I would start by talking to locals and perhaps a land use attorney in your area where your father owns the land. There are a number of means (legal, illegal, and quasilegal), by which one can be dispossessed of real estate, especially if the owner is out of the country (google adverse possession if you want to see one example). I would make sure that that land is still available, unoccupied, and in your father's name. If so, then I would first look into leasing it out to some large scale farmers, as that way you could generate income with minimal effort while you work on figuring out what else to do with it.",

So maybe find out what the Canadian government and NGOs may have to offer in the way of seed money, guarantees and other support services.\n\nTake a look at tourism (you book tours and tourists pay you in Canada), you can focus on the food industry.\n\nChicken farming, fruits, vegetables, and flowers for export.\n\nThe technology is readily available and you can act as supplier of equipment, training, and filling in the gaps in the areas of processing, transportation, and exporting of desirable goods.\n\nBut before you do anything, make sure that what you build won't be simply expropriated as soon as you prove that it's viable.",

Since many places are stabilizing and improving their economy and infrastructure, the use of tech to solve local issues will be needed. Things like financial inclusion, logistics, software, e-commerce, mobile apps, and other areas that will help digitize Africa could be very profitable in the near future. They also seem to have a shortage of qualified people in tech.",

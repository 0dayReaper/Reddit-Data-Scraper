    "postText": "\nHey Reddit!\n\nAs a web designer, developer, and SEO expert, I'm considering launching my own agency focused on the plumbing and HVAC industry. I'd love to hear your thoughts on a few key points:\n\n1. High Ticket Niche: Is the plumbing and HVAC industry considered a high ticket niche? Do businesses in this industry invest significantly in their online presence and marketing efforts?\n\n2. Pricing Expectations: How much do you think plumbers or plumbing companies would be willing to pay for a professional website? Understanding the price range would help me structure my offerings.\n\n3. Target Market: Should I focus on one country, such as the USA, Canada, or the UK, or would it be better to target multiple countries?\n\nTo build my portfolio, I'm offering a free website to anyone in the plumbing and HVAC industry. If you're interested or know someone who might be, please DM me. Your testimonials and comments would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for your insights and support",

            "comment": "For the vast majority, all a niche site targeting plumbing and HVAC means is certain stock images. Sure the search engine spam is specific, because the only thing in the online universe is the algorithm.\n\nOtherwise there isn't any particular design insights solving the problem of plumbers wanting to convert customers, charge a higher rate, differentiate from competitors or anything else. Worse still, the complete void of consideration *there could be* anything more.\n\nYou change the stock imagery and keywords and that is it. And that's why country, pricing, even site purpose are total mysteries: The exercise is a pleasant fiction. There aren't ideas gleaned from study of top selling plumbers ... no business aspect unique to the HVAC industry. Just another 'me too' site design. \n\nNo insight about the market niche. Because anything having to do with business priorities an owner might have are *all on them*.\n\n...If you could not consult on the business of plumbing and HVAC, if not one soul on this planet would pay you a nickel to work on *their business problems*, then do not think for one instance you offer the niche a solution.\n\n...If you couldn't so much as sell an ebook to them, don't then think you can sell a business presence without pushback and profound skepticism from a niche customer.\n\n...If you are selling a [lowest common denominator commodity](https://everybootstrap.site/), then ask what exactly is niche about what you offer. Stock imagery and search spam not withstanding. Question: What long-tail keyword insights can you provide that aren't standard to carpentry, the handyman, landscaping, a power wash outfit, a DIYer?\n\nIt is two-ought-twenty-and-three. Aside from the last SEM carpet bombing algo update, just what does design offer this specific niche -- [a carousel](https://medium.com/@sherpadesignco/carousels-are-killing-your-conversion-rate-heres-how-to-fix-that-b57e31f8f508)?\n\nJust a seeming excuse to shove web design down one throat rather than another. That is not niche target marketing, rather flailing around blindly trying to hit a customer.\n\nMy point being *understanding any concept from marketing or niche market demand* would help far more in structuring your offer than expecting a commenter to offer the magic right answer. You have these nich specific questions because you have zero knowledge of the niche. And that ain't great web design you charge premium prices for.\n\nThere are so many niche specific questions because you don't know anything about this niche. They are just industry titles you pulled directly out of your ass ...umptions about the location of the magical money tree. Bad News: web design chopped it down for [a measly few dollars](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell) in kindling decades ago when it laid waste to the entire industry.\n\nBut you may now retort \"[User Experience](https://uxplanet.org/ui-ux-the-rise-of-fake-design-1b2a6b2ede5e)\" because that is always hilarious.\n\nOdd how all of these question posts pretty much answer themselves.",

And you wouldn't have posted to the search engine drive through window of the forum.\n\nYour understanding would have extended to you mentioning your niche specific Unique Selling Proposition or something similar.\n\nThis purported claim of understanding is a fine way to be dismissive while putting an end to this line of discussion. And I am as glad of that end in sight as you are.\n\nBut let us wait and see if a millionaire plumber or some celebrity from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning niche -- seeing all the work you put into the post -- doesn't offer to adopt you by building a business around your questions.\n\nAt least you didn't write out 'the rich people' in your post. Kudos.",

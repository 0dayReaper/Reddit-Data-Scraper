Since there is no accounting, is that regulated?\n\nWhat's to stop someone from using a company card for their expenses in the US?",

            "comment": "Seems like a shady business, mate. But to answer your question, an LLC in the Bahamas can spend its money on anything legal. As for accounting, it's not required, but it's always a good idea to keep records. As for company card expenses, technically nothing's stopping you, but it's not exactly ethical, is it?",

In fact, he already has a client doing it.  \n\n\nIs a 20-30% tax rate on people who make 10-50k ethical? Who knows, but you can't survive that way in 2023. And I suppose that's the point of the Western system \u2014 keep the poor down and the rich up.",

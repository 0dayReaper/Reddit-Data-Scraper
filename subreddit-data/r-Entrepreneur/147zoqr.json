    "postText": "Alright so I am 22 female I got 21k in the bank, a lot of random cash, and 18.5k in crypto mostly bitcoin.I am quitting my full time job so I will have more time. I need to learn discipline I wanna use this time to be ALONE and just do this. I am in college. Only getting associates. I am hoping for my crypto to go up as it\u2019s mostly bitcoin and it\u2019s really up and down. I will eventually cash out.I will be essentially jobless and I want to be jobless for 2-4 weeks.  but I am getting a PART time job if needed just to maintain what I have. My dream is to have an online business, and sell things online and ship them out. This would be my dream. I\u2019ve thought about this so much. I know it\u2019s hard at first but I just wanna work from home. My thing is that I don\u2019t know WHAT to sell and how to get it to actually sell. My fear is I end up losing a ton of money selling a product that 1. Doesn\u2019t sell and 2. I can\u2019t get it to sell\n\nI\u2019m so sick of going to a stupid job. I just wanna work for my self. I know everyone says this but I am really sick of it. I am not getting better with time. I am getting lazier and crazier working myself to death. I\u2019m not improving at my job. I hate it . Some people can show up to work and not mind it but I\u2019ve been working 6-7 days a week for the past 3 years and I\u2019m really sick of it. It\u2019s better than being broke but I feel stupid wasting my time like this when I can just put in some work and work for my self and actually be HAPPIER with what I do. \n\nI know the answers aren\u2019t just given. But how do I find the answer to this? How do I find the right thing to sell and test it out? How do I list it and have people see MY stuff? And should I use Amazon, eBay or Shopify? How much money should I expect to lose with this trial and error?",

Sounds like you want to dropship peoples products, which is fine, but it\u2019s a saturated market. You need to a) Solve a problem and b) provide value, if you find a product that does this, you may have a chance. Your next big step is marketing, marketing is 200% something you need to research and learn. Next is SEO, learn SEO. Before all of this, you need to figure out how to set up a website (use Shopify maybe, they\u2019re doing a 3 month trial for \u00a31 a month  atm), figure out a brand, put 100% into it for at least 6 months. Nothing is going to land on your plate, you have to go out and catch it. \n\nEveryone hates their shitty 9-5, breaking away from it is ***everybody\u2019s*** dream. If it was that easy every man, woman and child on earth would be entrepreneurs. \n\nFind something you\u2019re passionate about, and monetise it.",

My problem is I don't care about the brand building part of the job, I just want to produce the stuff lol.\n\nA friend of mine used to run a makeup business that got pretty successful where she would just buy bulks ingredients and mix it herself and ship it out. I would totally do that if I had any passion at all about makeup, maybe up your alley perhaps. Tried candles in the past which was fun, I like the technical challenges of figuring out how to efficiently produce them. Just had no interest in creating a store and trying to get traction to it (I'm a software engineer by day so the thought of doing more code or using shopify to build a storefront after hours is like, the opposite of what I want to do, its what I'm trying to get away from lol)",

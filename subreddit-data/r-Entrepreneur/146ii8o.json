I was purely listing them as inspiration, I wanted the reddits thoughts or own ideas of what they think should be created to be useful. Sorry for the inconveniance.**\n\nI'm an AI engineer, previously employed at Braze &amp; Scale AI. I'm interested in identifying underdeveloped areas in digital marketing where AI can make a significant impact, &amp; make it accessible for the public, I am against select number of companies having access to this technology.What has not been created yet that's on your mind? What would you like to see created? Which existing AI/ML-based services do believe could benefit from improvements or refinements?\n\nI have experience in a range of ML algorithms, such as supervised learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks).Some ideas I currently have, I appreciate all thoughts, concerns, criticism:\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

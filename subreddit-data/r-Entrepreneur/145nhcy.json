    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI apologize if this is not the appropriate subreddit to post in. I'm just struggling with building a website. I am usually very good at these types of things, but I am now incorporating a lot of new elements I have never dealt with before. \n\nI have had a small pet sitting business for a while now, and I've been looking to expand it even further. Part of this expansion includes a new scheduling system, one that would make it easier for me to avoid overlapping sessions. I'm looking for a website builder that would allow me to book a \"multiple day\" session where I can charge per-day. For example, I want someone to be able to select dates June 09-June 24 in order to book a session with me. \n\nI was trying to use Wix for a while, but they don't have a \"multi-day booking\" system. They have a \"work around,\" but even that was overly complicated, and it didn't really fit what I was looking to do. If anyone has any suggestions to me, please let me know asap! I would really like to get this site built sometime before August!\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI'm the CTO and a co-founder of a popular digital collectible company (not going to say the name for confidentiality). We released back in the Summer of 2022, sold out, and brought in almost 3 million dollars on the inital sale of our collection. Recently, we've been going the route of VC funding to push our IP brand outside the web3 ecosystem, but before that, we need to setup a parent company and distrubute shares amoungst us founders (mistake on us, should have done this before). There are 4 of us, 2 CEOs, 1 CTO and 1 CMO. After talking about share distribution, I was extremely upset and was about to leave the company. For context, the CEOs owned 95% during this discussion and offer.\n\nI do want to explain how much I've contributed to the company. I was brought on before we even made the twitter account and agreed to do work for free and whatever happend, we would split the amount of sales off of initial release. I have built everything we have from bringing on 2 developers for my team, art generation, release, websites, other applications etc. Everything we have online, I've done from a tech side perspective with myself and my team. I've also helped with company decisions, pivots, and customer service in the server.\n\nAfter the release, everyone got their portions and I got the 3rd highest amount. It was a fair distrubution, and everyone was decently happy with their sale portions. After the sale, everyone started to receive a salary, and again, everyone was happy with their salary. For me, I accpeted a lower salary than what most developers in the USA North East Coast would receive because I was also a student at the time, expected a lot of my work to show up in equity, and most of the team is based outside the country. I still ended up putting at least 30 hours a week in while in school (graduated now).\n\nNow going back to the reason of the small equity offered to me (talked my way up to 5%, but still not happy) is that development is too expensive and too slow and I don't offer many ideas to the company regarding technology. I disagreed with too expensive and too slow, because what we do in a short amount of time is incredible for the cost we spend. The ideas part, I sorta agreed with, but the hard part is, keeping budget down and hitting these deadlines is enough of an issue to deal with rather than myself becoming a product manager and stepping away from coding (would love to stop coding).\n\nI've never discussed equity splitting before so looking for some guidance here. Shouldn't I be getting more equity with how much I've contributed? Is there anything I can be doing better? There's a part of me that wants to leave and do something of my own because I know I can do it, but I still want to get what I deserve out of this.",

            "comment": "Unless you have something that confirms that you are owed equity, then you have nothing. You arent legally owed anything because you worked harder or took a lower salary. You need an email or a confirmation that X% is your ownership from someone like the CEO (verbal commitment is a contract but youre going to need witnesses). If you dont have that, then you really dont have much.\n\nDo you own the 5% now? Is it vested? If its vested I would take the shares and bounce.\n\n&gt;there's a part of me that wants to leave and do something of my own because I know I can do it\n\nDo this instead. And dont give away any equity.",

I'm an ethical person and have many great relationships with people, but would it be right to use my leverage that everything is under my accounts and CCs to get more equity? All the accounts that we have have been created by me, paid for with my CCs such as domains, emails, repositories, even recruitment software (which i also set up), gnosis safe etc.. I am of course compensated for using my CCs.",

It is a very line, you're free to do as you wish but based on what you summarized, it's going to be extremely difficult for any of your peers to give up anymore of their equity to you, no matter how right you are.",

Have you invested money in the business? \n\nOr were you brought in by the CEO\u2019s and appointed as the CTO? \n\nIn the first scenario, 5% isn\u2019t reasonable at all. In the second scenario it would be about average, and maybe even a little generous considering that you have also been compensated for your initial investment in time by your cut from the sales. \n\nWhat you should do regardless, is negotiate better pay now that you\u2019ve finished your studies.",

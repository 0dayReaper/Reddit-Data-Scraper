I\u2019ve paid myself every month comparatively to what I was making before to basically keep my lifestyle and stay out of personal debt.  Today I closed my books with roughly:\n\n$10k in cash\n\nI\u2019m owed:\n$900 out 61-90 days (way to go state of SC)\n$7k out 31-60 days\n$21k out 1-30 days \n\nI owe $6k in the next 30 days, and have $6k on the business credit card.  \n\nThe pipeline is growing. \n\nI\u2019m sitting in my office with my accounting software on one screen and Reddit on the other and I have tears rolling down my face.

            "comment": "Congratulations! I ran an agency for two years until I decided it wasn't for me and sold the contracts. \n\nA few things I learnt along the way, if I may:\n\nBe aware of your risk profile (if a client leaves, what's your income like), and try and get more clients to rely less on any one big one. (My first client was a $35k contract so I was immediately aware of most of my initial income was coming from one client).\n\nAlways, always, always stop work on a client as soon as they stop payment. I had 2 clients tell me they needed another week (which went on for weeks) for payment, until they decided they didn't have money to pay me after I did the work (this cost me $11k, as it wasn't worth pursuing legal costs and stress to chase).\n\nAlways have solid contracts with a clear scope of work and terms and conditions. Many clients don't know what's considered part of the job, so you may need to be clear as to what's NOT included. For example: if you build a website, make sure you tell the client you're not making it compatible for an I.E. version from fucking 1995. Clients will shit bricks over 1 person who couldn't view their website properly.\n\nDiversified services allow you to offer more to each client (and get a better lifetime value), but hinder your efforts to scale and manage your time effectively. Try and find a balance and don't spread yourself too thin.\n\nWhen doing proposals don't do too much effort upfront and share your ideas - I spent 2 days on a large proposal, only for the client to never respond to me and implement my ideas a month down the track. Stupid on my part, but lesson learnt.\n\nDon't screw around with shitty employees. Make sure your first hires are people you would want to hang around with and have solid skills. Don't be tempted to go for \"cheaper\" employees that you can \"teach\". They'll suck valuable time from you that you don't have and cause headaches. Think about value for money.\n\nAsk for referrals and testimonials. They go a huge way to growing your client list and help in closing your proposals.\n\nAlways re-confirm new tasks in emails. You want, and need an email trail.\n\nDon't respond to emails/phone calls straight away or out of business hours. Clients will get stupid expectations of you (yes, I had clients call me on Christmas Day FFS). Most of the shit they think is \"urgent\" is not. And can wait. And will usually resolve itself within an hour, rendering an email response from you a waste of time.\n\nThere will be ups and downs, but it's hugely gratifying knowing you can make it on your own! Just remember to set time aside for yourself and don't burn yourself out. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit: Thank you for my first gold!",

This is obviously my opinion so far, so I could be wrong in my thinking, but it's where I'm up to at the moment.\n\nAfter closing the business I spent some time on holidays (I overworked myself, so I needed a break). After that I worked at a tech startup but didn't feel passionate enough about it so I moved on from there too. I am currently working on a outdoor lifestyle product business, which fits more in line with my personal interests (but it's very early days and it has a whole set of other challenges that I'm not used to, but I'm enjoying it).\n\nThere were a few problems I saw with the business:\n\n1. Passion. If I'm honest this is really the crux of it. I enjoy marketing, but I realised I only really enjoy marketing things I care deeply enough to want to share with others. Working on other people's businesses that I didn't care about was difficult. Simple advertising was fine, but being creative with something I wasn't passionate about, refining their branding and pushing things further to carve out a true edge and market for them, when I  a) didn't care enough, b) didn't have control over certain things/decisions was difficult.\n\n2. Lifestyle. I didn't enjoy the day to day work enough, and I've always wanted a more flexible business that's not as dependent on myself or my location. I realised that I was building a business that was far too dependent on me and it would take far too long to get to a stage where I'd have the ability to have a more flexible lifestyle (this obviously fits in with passion because I have found when you enjoy your work you don't feel like you're working really). In hindsight, it may have been easier with a partner in this respect.\n\n3. Scalability. From my experience, service businesses can be set up with very minimal capital (I started from home with only enough to pay my rent for a few months), but they're often more difficult to scale. I've always wanted to think big long term and I couldn't see the business getting to a big enough size or keeping me excited enough to satisfy a long term vision. My business mentor also stressed that if I wanted to sell the company, service based agencies are notoriously difficult to sell, as clients often leave, and contracts, IP or software were the only real assets to sell.\n\nTLDR: I wasn't passionate enough about it.\n",

Stuff you can wear climbing, cycling, travelling and at a bar without looking like you just came from Kathmandu. Most people won't wear outdoor apparel everyday because it looks shit, but a lot of the materials and tech are far superior and you can use the same clothes for multiple activities.",

Lack of passion probably didn't help with dealing with the problems, but my issue was maintaining the workload rather than getting clients. This seems to be a common thread (at least from the agencies I've worked in, or had friends work in/own). \n\nI think part of the difficulty was poor business skills on my part with things such as setting client expectations when it came to responding to emails etc, hiring employees that couldn't do their job without a lot of my time involvement, and offering too many services that required juggling too many things without efficient systems in place to ease workload.\n\nBut from my experience, you can only comfortably manage 3-30 clients depending on the client size and what service you're offering. \n\nAs a startup, chances are you'll be closer to a higher number of clients at a lower value per client, as you need a portfolio, social proof that you can do what you say, as well as better management software for larger clients for ads/reporting, analytics and SEO etc, much of which are quite expensive unless you have a decent buffer of clients or high value clients.\n\nHaving more clients means more time spent doing proposals, pitching, emails, reporting, analytics, etc, so it can be difficult to manage your time.\n\nIn order to maintain quality of service you need to maintain the ratio of staff to clients, so if you want to increase revenue, you'll always need to increase staff, which is quite a considerable cost, as well as cost and time investment in hiring etc.\n\nIt also becomes difficult when you offer multiple services as you either need trained staff to be across multiple services, or have dedicated staff for each service, which again becomes difficult before you get enough clients to cover the cost of your staff.\n\nI'm not saying it can't be done (there are plenty of agencies that do manage to do it) and finance could help to transition during cashflow intensive periods, but when you compare it to a SaaS business, or FMCG businesses, in my eyes it seems far more difficult to scale. Sure the startup costs for SaaS or FMCG are considerably higher, and the barrier to entry is higher, but everything has pros and cons, and I decided having an agency wasn't the model that I preferred to scale considering my needs in the business. \n\nThen again, perhaps I'm more ignorant to other product based businesses!? \n",

Legal costs I can understand, though they shouldn't get too high since this is a very basic case and shouldn't take much work for any lawyer. Also, since you can be 99% sure you would have won, they would have to pay for your lawyer anyway. But stress? How is it more then 2 hours of work for you to tell a lawyer and give him all the files you have? Even if it would be 10 hours of involvement for you, that would put you at $1100 per hour...",

I had nothing else to do.  Now I have three little balls of paper on the left side of my keyboard.  I move all three to the right side of my keyboard everyday when I move something forward.  It\u2019s not always somebody new.  I have a hard time coming up with that many new people to call now, but I move something forward.  Like I move one someday because I make a cold call and they let me quote on something.  Then a few days later I move it again because I gave them that quote and I had a good conversation with them.  I never move them for existing clients unless I solicit some new business.  \n\nThere\u2019s no secret.  The secret to being able to a shitload of pushups is doing a shitload of pushups.  Have a good reason to call them and just call them.  Ask them if they have a minute to talk.  A bunch will blow you off, fuck them.  But a lot of people in this world are cool and if you call them and tell them that you\u2019re beating bushes they appreciate that.  Be humble. You\u2019re selling.  So what?  There\u2019s no need to be smooth.  \n\nWith that said, 600 cold calls, truthfully, like ten new customers.  But I made just did a $5,000 job for one of them, and I made about $2,000.  \n\nSo $2,000 divided by 600 cold call is $3/call.  They take like two minutes per.  So get one new customer per 600 phone calls.  \n\nDo the behavior everyday.  Nice people are everywhere.  You\u2019ll fall into them.  ",

Lots of companies do SEO badly and getting more web traffic is massively valuable so it's easy to sell your services. Charge a monthly rate and once they see the traffic rolling in, it's easy for them to justify the cost.\n\nOnce you get SEO down, it's best to decide who you wanna focus on the most. If you're helping brick-and-mortar stores build a web presence, then learn about social media campaigns and pitch those services next. If you're helping bloggers or eCommerce stores (that might have blogs as well) then I'd focus on link-building.\n\nAs for other skills, writing good copy, making good ads (narrowing down an audience, A/B testing, having attractive photos, etc) are all good as well. I'd also look into organic growth for social media channels like Instagram or Facebook, as these can be huge, depending on who your clients are.\n\nThink about who's using your client's products/services and where they might be and what their interests are. That should get you on the right path.",

I know for a fact there are a lot of small businesses who need/want video but usually the video companies are very set in their ways with what they'll actually produce. \n\nFor example, what's really useful to me as a market to get produced is small, bite size videos I can use on social media. I commissioned 5 one minute videos. \n\nHow many videographers have I seen advertising this service? None. \n\nWhen they do reach out it's always for 'video' and not practical ways that video can be used. Message people and say you'll do them x3 talking head client testimonials for x dollars and what the benefits of that will be. \n\nEven offering quick video edits of free stock footage would be hugely profitable and useful to marketers. But my friends who offer video are SO unwilling to work on anything that isn't a full day of filming. ",

I've always felt that customers disengage from a cold email after a few sentences, so it's better to summarise what you do and hope for the best. Trying to explain how it can be utilised might be a bit longer than your average attention span - that being said, it's still worth a shot.\n\n&gt; Even offering quick video edits of free stock footage would be hugely profitable and useful to marketers. \n\nI'm looking to produce bespoke videos, so that's not really my business model. Even if it were, acquiring licences to use high quality stock footage can get reaaaaally expensive unless it's your own stock footage - but then that's entirely changing your business model.\n\n&gt; But my friends who offer video are SO unwilling to work on anything that isn't a full day of filming.\n\nI completely empathise with your position, and it's a tough one because filming for a single hour becomes unprofitable because you're realistically unable to commit to other jobs in the same because of breaking down equipment and travelling. That being said, I usually still offer clients half day prices (5 hours) instead of full days, which I think is something that puts me at a competitive edge.",

Started originally part-time on upwork for experience and ratings.  \nThe sales process I don't have a problem with but I'm finding the product offering is frustrating to nail down when you feel you can offer more than a few things especially the pitch tilt or the USP.  \nHow many times did you change your pitch or value proposition from messing with it?  \n  \nRelated to that, did you have a website already or did that come later? I've changed my website once and about to finalize a 2nd change due to slightly shifting markets. ",

And I can't help but agree it is very challenging to ignite the passion in yourself while working for businesses that you don't care as much. \n\nIt is definitely a plus to take the burden of indebtedness off your shoulders while growing your business. Keep up the motivation!\n\nHere's my story:\nI graduated from an economics and spanish degree call it the arts/social science combo.\nPaid close to $6k for moving/immigration\nSold my car for $13,500, with an extra $4k pocket$$ \nI owe CAD $6.5k in student loans.\n\nStill a newbie in Redit and digital marketing.\nI'm looking to help out the community first before earning from anyone. Hopefully I can make the most out of working with small businesses on a \"pro bono\" basis for the time being.",

We do the graphic design, printing, signs, mailers, videos - all the legwork, but I need a salesperson / someone with real marketing knowledge (tracking ROI, steering the strategy, making the payment arrangements with clients) to help turn us into an actual marketing agency. Any one-man marketing agencies want a built-in shop to handle the actual work? Bonus if you're in southeastern Pennsylvania. ",

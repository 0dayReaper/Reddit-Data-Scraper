    "postText": "We all have our favourite memories from childhood. Nothing hits like nostalgia. Different retro phases come, Top Gun jus had a new version, could video games be the next big wave for throwbacks? Really popular video games get remastered but that is few and far between every couple years. With the accessibility of AI tools could developers remake our childhood favourites cheaper and faster to make it more viable with less cost risk?\r  \n\r  \nThe way I see it is this. The generation that grew up with video games are now having kids and introducing their own kids to those games. Our parents showed us classic movies from their childhood, new generations are doing that with Video Games. Second, I would love to play some of my old games and sometimes do. Friends and I gush over our favourites and sometimes get together to play them, despite the graphics being terrible and game play having too much lag. The sales can be to all the original players, plus the new generation that might be interested in the story but not willing to sit through that terrible game play. \r  \n\r  \nGiven they own the IP, have the story, characters etc. as an example they could us Ai to recreate most of the graphics saving thousands of hours for the designers so they only have finish it perfectly, do you think this is a revenue stream that could explode for OG game developers? And what games would you want done, I\u2019d love to see a Scarface remastered in a RockStart style!",

With the advancements in technology, remastering old games can bring back childhood memories for an older generation and introduce the younger generations to classic games. Plus, who doesn't want to see their favorite games with better graphics! I'm all for a Spyro remastered  or a Crash Bandicoot remastered version!",

Oh and YUCK. \n\nBut of course, you'd have to make some sort of persuasive argument that specific game has a market -- and you are the one to exploit it -- just like any starter-outer fails so well at.\n\nSo my suggestion would be, step one: Be A Credible Influencer.",

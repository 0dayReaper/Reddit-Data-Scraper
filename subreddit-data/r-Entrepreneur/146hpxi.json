    "postText": "What do you guys think?\n\nI am wondering if offering unlimited renderings and revisions, including 2D renderings, floor plans, videos, VR, etc., would be better as packaged deals or monthly subscriptions.\n\nThe packaged service would be priced per project, while subscriptions would be available for one project at a time.\n\nThe prices would be more affordable than in-house options while maintaining the quality of an agency, ranging from watercolor renderings to realism.",

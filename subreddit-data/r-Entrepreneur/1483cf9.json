Just publish on Amazon KDP. \nDepending on the types of illustrations you need you might be able to use AI like Midjourney. \nOtherwise hire them on places like Upwork or Fiverr \nOr you can even assemble using clip art (double check on the license) \nGood luck!",

I created a Marvel style comic book using Midjourney using original characters (aka so the robots couldn\u2019t use existing images for reference) so it\u2019s possible. But it\u2019s frustrating. And I 100% was just playing around to see if it was possible. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t use friends or family unless they are professionals. Not because they wouldn\u2019t be talented but they may never turn it in on time. And now you will be upset with them.",

    "postText": "Need some \"Sunday Entrepreneurial Inspiration?\" May I suggest these two Netflix shows-\n\nArnold - His life story  \nInventing Anna - The Anna Sorokin story\n\nDisclaimer, I never watch TV for entertainment. I watch TV to learn something. I won't spoil the endings LOL, but I will share three fundamental take-aways that I found extremely valuable. Even as a 7-figure earning entrepreneur at age 50, I have a lot to learn from Arnold and Anna.   \n\n\nARNOLD-\n\n1. Set a goal and work towards it. No goal = no direction. Without a goal, we are merely drifters on the planet. What is your goal, and more importantly, do you really want to achieve it?\n2. Have a belief system. This is where you create the mindset that no matter what, you will take the proper action despite obstacles, setbacks, fears and failures to achieve said goal.\n3. Taking action - Arnold said that building habits were key  \u201cThere\u2019s an advantage of doing things automatically, I have a routine where you don\u2019t have to think much \u2014 if at all. \\[Routines\\] are the foundation of a house.\u201d\n\nArnold summary - What I enjoyed most about it, was his tenacity, perseverance and drive. In the show, you can see how Arnold's attitude affected everything. He had a good time on his journey. He seemed to always be connecting people, and looking out for others best interests, (see the Jamie Lee Curtis clip about True Lies). Sure Arnold had an ego, but to do anything successful and meaningful, it starts with your belief that you do anything, no what can go wrong.  \n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nANNA-\n\nOkay, so yes, she was a little demented, and maybe suffered from reality distortion, but let's focus on the fundamental principles of getting what you want out of life -   \n\n\n1. Anna did not wait for opportunities, she created them. One of my mentors told me years ago that if a door does not appear, you create one. Anna knew what she wanted. More than glitz, glamour and a lux lifestyle, she wanted to create something. ADF or Anna Delvey Foundation was her goal. And she would not let anything stand in her way, including no access to money.\n2. Being \"On Brand\" -  Anna knew that in order to persuade the \"rich assholes of Wall Street\" she had to look the part. So, what is your \"brand?' Anna not only looked the part, she could talk the talk. She was so well educated and informed on style, brands, artists, and culture, she was so convincing and persuading. We all can learn to be the \"perceived expert\" in our chosen field.\n3. Re-invent yourself. You can come from nothing, be starting over, or decide you you want to do something different. You can re-invent yourself despite your past. This lesson is incredibly powerful and reminds us that even if we have balls, or don't, we can grow a bigger pair in order to achieve our dreams and goals. \n\nAnna Summary - Similar to Arnold, every one has dreams to do something with their lives, but dreams are only dreams until you turn it into a Vision or goal. Anna created a vision of a better life by going to America. She created a vision of a life of luxury, but was willing to work her ass off even if it was unscrupulous. She re-invented herself despite lack of education and money. Moral of the story, paint your vision n your mind, go educate yourself and then go find the money.  \n\n\nHave you seen these shows? Would love your feedback and even suggestions for what has inspired you.\n\nHere is a really cool link about persuasion. Happy Sunday everyone-   \nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-of-life/201212/the-6-principles-of-persuasion  \n",

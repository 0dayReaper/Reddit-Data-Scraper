    "postText": "There\u2019s a lot of you on here who reach out for guidance about leaving your full time job to start your own business. I want to outline a few things that I wish I had known prior to leaving my job that would\u2019ve saved me a ton of headache.\n\n***If you don\u2019t know how to cook, the chef owns the restaurant***\n\nFor the record, I had no clue how to paint aside from working in the summer with my father when I was 12. At that time, all I did was light prep work. Like taping, prepping, and cleaning up trash and brushes at the end of the day.\n\nI bought into the insane idea that I would be able to run my painting business without any real painting knowledge or having to do any painting whatsoever.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to get knocked off my high horse of \u201ccollecting checks\u201d when the sub I hired to perform the work decided not to show half way through one of the jobs\u2026 This left me in a very vulnerable position. One that no business owner should ever allow themselves to be in.\n\nMy advice is to NEVER get into business without knowing how to produce the end result yourself. I spent the next 6 months working along side my workers and building a team. I learned the ins and outs of painting and can now handle any task that would be required of us on any job myself.\n\n***If you don\u2019t get the foundation right early, you probably never will***\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll set up payroll once we get things running\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll set up workers\u2019 comp after we get a few jobs under our belt\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get accountant at some point, just not yet\u2026\u201d\n\nWith this mentality, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure. Not taking care of these things early on will make it way more difficult to implement in the future. The reason many small businesses struggle with this is because at some point they get comfortable. They are making money, they are producing results, and to retract back to these foundational responsibilities scares them.\n\nIf you\u2019re starting a business, don\u2019t wait for growth to take place to validate your responsibility to take action on these requirements.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t build your skyscraper on a foundation made of sand.\n\n***Delegate &amp; Duplicate, Don\u2019t get attached***\n\nThe reasons why small business owners are always over-worked is because they have a serious attachment issue. They can\u2019t see themselves letting go of what they\u2019re \u201cgood at\u201d in fear that it won\u2019t be done to standard of which it would be done if they were doing it or producing it themselves. This especially holds true in the trades.\n\nYour time is your most valuable asset. You have to learn to let go of all of the day to day responsibilities. You have to learn how to delegate tasks to other people and be OK if they make a mistake or mess up. The sooner you let go of controlling every aspect of your business, the sooner you give it permission to grow. It\u2019s kind of like a dating relationship. If you suffocate it by trying to control every aspect of the other person, that obviously won\u2019t end up well.\n\nThe end goal is to duplicate yourself. When you start small, you\u2019re obviously doing a ton of different tasks, but the goal is to delegate and train others to do those tasks the way you do them, this is called duplication and is very important for the success of your business\n\n***Hiring and dating are a lot alike***\n\nHiring is by far the most important aspect of any business. I credit a majority of my company\u2019s success due to a strong hiring process that is designed to filter out applicants and funnel in the best possible candidate for our job openings.\n\nThe issue for me was, I didn\u2019t start developing a strong process for hiring until about a year in. I kind of did one of those \u201cHey, do you know anyone that would want to work with us?\u201d Or, did a general post somewhere with no real end goal.\n\nYou get out what you put in. If you put out a crappy post with no strong requirements, you\u2019ll get people that have low standards, just like your post.\n\nIf you put out a strong post that has strong requirements for the position you are looking for with a detailed plan for entry, a phone interview, an in person interview, a working interview and a background check\u2026well, you\u2019re probably going to get someone that has high standards.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a major producer to implement this sort of hiring policy, you simply just have to be able to implement it and follow through with it.\n\nMany small businesses especially when starting out hire out of desperation, another relationship analogy, if you date out of desperation, that\u2019s never a good thing.\n\n***If you don\u2019t actively convey your vision to your team for your company, they\u2019ll create their own for themselves***\n\nDon\u2019t assume that just because you\u2019re paying someone they will be loyal to you. By nature, humans like progress.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve found in my business is that the more I convey my vision for the company to my team, the greater the morale.\n\nThis is not only a collective vision, but individual vision as well for the members of the team. I am always asking them what their life goals are such as purchasing a house, getting a car, etc. and trying my best to help them achieve it.\n\nIf I stay engaged with their goals, and encourage them to use the success of the business to help them achieve it, it\u2019s a win win for everyone.\n\nI hope you got something out of these tips!

There will always be competition and that fear is what stops a lot of people from ever owning anything in there lives. There\u2019s plenty of money to go around. Competition truly exist when your business is average. Being above average really isn\u2019t that hard either, plenty of others have set the bar pretty low.\n\n\nYour second point, again, is attributed to running a failing business . If estimating is hard for you, if managing is hard for you, if hiring is hard, holy crap running a business isn\u2019t for you! Equipment and tools are so cheap now, and larger equipment can be rented . Not having a space is just another excuse as well. I started fabricating out of my garage. I would have beams sticking out of the garage into the alley, but I got the job done. Your work should also speak for itself, and if it\u2019s quality, people will come looking for you, especially with trades. \n\nScaling happens naturally if you are doing what any business owner is expected to do. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I stress. COVID stressed me out a ton! Regardless, I\u2019ve learned to manage stress, and not let stress manage me. \n\n there\u2019s a ton of risk! That risk shouldn\u2019t be scary, it should be motivating.",

If you're painting 3 houses a year on the side, then yea, you don't need an accountant or bookkeeper. But if you're truly making a business out of it, you need to hire one.\n\nYou're going to tell yourself that you can save that money by doing it yourself in Quickbooks. But ONE, you won't. It's the last thing you'll want to do. You'll put it off over and over again until it's time to file taxes. At that point, you'll rush to finish it and TWO, you'll do it wrong.\n\nWhen you finally decide to hire a bookkeeper and/or accountant, you'll pay them a whole lot of money to redo everything correctly. So now you've spent your own time doing a bunch of things wrong, and you have to pay someone to do it all again. Just bite the bullet and hire someone to do it. Your time is much better spent building your business rather than trying to figure out how a credit memo is different from a refund receipt and what to do when you record a loan payment that's part interest and part principal.",

Hire someone once you have revenue. And really, once you have recurring revenue. One job does not a business make.\n\nUntil then, you're honestly better off just not using any sort of Quickbooks/Xero type software on your own. It'll be worse if someone like me comes in and has to undo everything you did than if you just didn't do anything at all and we can start from the beginning. Keep track of receipts. Do a spreadsheet of expenses if you want. Do not start entering your own stuff into QBO or Xero.\n\nGET A SEPARATE BUSINESS BANK ACCOUNT. That's the number one thing that'll make it easy for a bookkeeper or accountant to come in after you've been running for a bit. So many people just run their business from their personal checking and it's a nightmare to try to sort through.",

So many issues wrong with how the paint was applied. But again, for some, they want the cheap work, so to each their own. Source: one of our businesses is a paint store and we engage with contractors that run the gamut - from those doing the the $500 paint job to the $50,000 paint job (large lake house with 39 colors).",

So we want to make you stay. Whether it's with money, stocks, benefits, a percentage of your salary to your family if you die, or a baby goat because you always wanted one. The skills and tricks you learn to make something run, and run well, aren't something companies can grab physically and keep you from leaving with.\n\nThink of it like building bridges. You have two teams. Team a has the instructions, previous experience, and are pretty competent.\nTeam  b, wrote the original instructions, helped with the revisions, and have built this exact bridge fifteen other times in different scenarios.\n\nAs an employer you really really don't want the members of team b to leave.\nBoth teams are probably gonna build a good bridge. Team b will do it better though. \n\nFinding ways to make code work is weird. Yeah you can't run off with your work from one employer and take it to the next, but you already solved that problem and you know how to do it in the future and the next time you set up a solution when you encounter the same problem you'll do it with less trial and error.\n\nSo we pay programmers. Bigger companies can afford to pay them more. Otherwise someone else will.\n\nGood doesn't mean you did ten years and are competent by default. Good is proven with examples of your work or if you are legendary tier like Google, puzzles and challenges in the interview process.\n\nEdit: on second thought I guess you could call the people who code for gigantic tech firms the best. But the rest of the point still stands.",

Fixing it later was more trouble than doing it right the first time.  Specifically:\n\n\\- get an accountant from day 1.  Having a good accountant means you only have to pay attention to revenue and expenses, not all the complicated stuff.  An accountant can also get your books setup correctly from the start, and give you advice on what's deductible and what's not.  Mine helped me reclassify some purchases that moved them from depreciable to a standard expense. \n\n\\- Get the LLC right away.  Changing company formation later is basically shutting down your Sole Prop and starting the company up again.  Legal names change, bank account names change. Taxes change.  Liability changes.  Insurance needs change.  Worst of all, contracts change so you need to terminate any existing contract and sign an new one with your new company .  This is a convenient time for the customers to try to renegotiate, or just drop you altogether.  For those customer that you keep, they have to write checks to \"someone different\" so you have to deal with A/P with each one.  Then there's the 3-4 month transition from the old bank accounts to the new ones, wondering where to deposit that paper check, or not knowing if CustomerX paid an invoice and you just can't find that payment.\n\n\\- get your contracts reviews by an attorney.  Trying to copy/paste off the internet or copy a contract from a previous job can lead to unexpected consequences.  \n\n\\- for hiring help, like an assistant, wait until you need it.\n\n\\- for a non-programmer to start a tech biz, you don't need to know how to program but you need to know the process the devs go through.  What's involved in building a new feature?  Fixing a bug?  Pushing to production?  How long should each of these things take?  Where are they in the process? What are normal problems and what are unusual problems? I'm a dev, but I build things in tech I don't know so i hire that knowledge.  I couldn't do what they do, but I know how they need to go about getting results so I can monitor and evaluate their work.  I also know what deliverables are reasonable to expect, so I insist on those.",

Then zoom out again. And slow their roll to look at success not just cash in hand that moment, if they are serious they will at least consider it. \nCongratulations on learning and adjusting your view despite it being the hard way. peace \u270c\ud83c\udfff",

How do you do that (financially and psychologically) when you're building the business and not yet profitable?\n \nAppreciate your last point about building the vision - a good reminder for me.",

So that someone (you) can have oversight, alongside with the employee(if not hire a consultant that does know). Make sure to use your time wisely by delegating your workload. They are being paid so they should be doing the work and for you to manage them. Make sure all the processes are thoroughly designed to get them done correct(hiring, ect).\n\nFor the most part make sure things get done efficiently and effectively. The most optimal outcome. Make sure how to understand what is being done. How to improve the business next year. Is this basically it, managing, pushing everyone towards executing and having oversight?",

That really left me hanging so I decided to just learn how to code on my own. It was not easy but I'm happy to say that I now have my own hand-made product that's generating revenue!",

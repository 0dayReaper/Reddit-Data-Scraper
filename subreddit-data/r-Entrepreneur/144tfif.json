    "postText": "I have been researching the idea of renting out lawn equipment like pressure washers, lawn mowers, leaf blowers, etc. I have come across apps/websites like Fat Llama, Idle, Rentr, and Lend Me it. The problem that I am running into is that these apps do not seem to have a lot of users or reviews, so I am unsure if I will really get any rentals using these. I also have researched using Craigslist or Facebook MarketPlace, which seems like it could be viable, however they do not have a specific category for renting things like equipment, so I am also weary on using these. Does anyone have experience using any of these apps/websites to rent things out, or experience renting items/equipment out in general?\n\nI appreciate any advice/input, thanks a ton!",

Some people will rent equipment to do the jobs too rowdy for their own equipment. \n\nThird question, what is your hedge for people not just buying equipment? Couldn\u2019t someone just buy a $100 pressure washer? What about a $100 used mower.\n\nWhy would I even want to rent a mower from you? \n\nThe secret to quality rental business is have machinery that\u2019s specialized and quality. For instance, Honda Mowers or upper mid tier equipment. Physical media marketing is ideal. Online marketing is great too, but buy Facebook ads.",

I know a decent amount to fix machines myself, but realistically not enough.\n\nMy thought process was catering to the market of people who will not use this equipment often, so they seem more value in renting than buying and owning. To be fair, I am not entirely sure this market is big enough to provide a substantial profit for it to be worth it, but I was doing research on it none the less.\n\nI really appreciate your input and advice, thank you!",

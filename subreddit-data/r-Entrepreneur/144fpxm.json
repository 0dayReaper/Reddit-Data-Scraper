Make sure to filter them by ticket size i.e. don\u2019t reach out to firms that buy businesses much much bigger than yours. Or much smaller.\n\nBefore that you need to prepare a 1 pager teaser with highlights about your asset. You can find a template online. \n\nThere is a process that these firms follow, which a sell side advisor would handle for you (including the prep of a teaser, IM, negotiations). For a fee. \n\nThe scale of your business will dictate if it makes sense to hire sell side advisors and if PE firms will be interested. Some deals are just too small for PE.\n\nEDIT: typos",

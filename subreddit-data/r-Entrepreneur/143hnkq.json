Gap Selling is the best course I\u2019ve seen.  Never Split the Difference is a great supplemental course/read.",

I'm working on starting to market on social media for this start-up company I'm helping with, and have no idea how to begin. Although it might be slightly different than these topics, I believe they will still give some helpful advice.",

    "postText": "Obviously consumers will be hugely disadvantaged by net neutrality going away. But for many small businesses it could mean massive restructuring, big cost increases and potentially shutting down altogether.\n\nBig companies will have enough volume and money to negotiate deals that keep them functional and profitable. But without net neutrality that is not guaranteed for small businesses that rely on the web.\n\nSo please, [go here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) and do your part. There's nothing better for a true entrepreneur than a free and open marketplace. Let's do it!",

The three (out of five) FCC Commissioners planning to vote *against* Net Neutrality are Ajit Pai, Michael O'Rielly, and Brendan Carr. Here are the links to directly email them:\n\n* [Ajit Pai](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai?qt-leadership_tabs=6#qt-leadership_tabs)\n\n* [Michael O'Rielly](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/mike-orielly?qt-leadership_tabs=6#qt-leadership_tabs)\n\n* [Brendan Carr](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr?qt-leadership_tabs=6#qt-leadership_tabs)\n\nThis is an easy way to directly get in touch with those who will be casting the votes. Here's a message that will drive the point across. Feel free to edit or to send a completely different one:\n\n\"Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet. Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all.\"",

They've committed to repealing it because they've been bought buy ISPs. Sometimes I wonder if they read these letters we send for a good laugh. HAHA look at the retarded middle class idiots! Caring about their businesses failing! As long as Comcast pads my wallet, who gives a crap about the little guy?\n\nYeah, I get in the future we can vote them out via a new administration, but the damage that be inflicted will take a lot to undo.

To my knowledge (from people I work with who specialise in this sort of thing) we have none at all. Frankly speaking with that knowledge it's hard to know if anything will change in Australia.\n\nThat said I would imagine some of the ISP's here getting silly ideas. It helps to bear in mind it would be particularly challenging to have packages based on what is being reported will happen, given that ADSL is a non-guaranteed service (1.5 mbps is the guaranteed speed by law minimum and no I'm not joking). So to have proper throttling you need enough bandwidth and usable speed on the consumer side for it to be a noticeable difference in the first place. Or to even make it worthwhile for an ISP.\n\nEither way NN is an absolute must.\n\nSource: Used to work for an ISP. Worked and still do work in IT including hosting my whole working life.",

That It's a monopoly by about 2 corporations that are RENOWN for being hated by the masses for errors, overpriced, rising costs, and charges for services that previously were granted (data caps). In many areas of the US, consumers only have ONE cable giant to choose from. No market options, control, competition. They must be running out of ways to increase profits, if they're going as far as charging per website.\n  \nMaybe Cable should be regulated more like a utility, to prevent more package deals and divided costs to 'raise profit lines' for these monopolies.

In fact I\u2019d say that is about a year\u2019s time, after the rules actually go into effect, we will see them attempting this. He can abuse powers like anti-trust or other corruption investigations by his justice department to gain leverage over ISPs.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that this is happening, but even worse that it\u2019s happening under a Trump presidency where we are likely to see the most corrupt possibilities emerging at the earliest possible times. ISPs may soon learn that It is best to placate the current president and kowtow to their whims, with Trump as their first taste of a politicized internet policy.",

I know everyone is pretty much fed up with the big 3 and all of the issue's they have caused.  Or there would almost be a way for this to back fire on the big 3 that would force them to be competitive again.

That's part of the overarching problem. _IF_ there was a healthy market for ISPs, you would be correct, but most households only have 1 or 2 broadband options. (The 90% number you see floated is of census blocks, not individual households. If comcast serves half the block and Verizon the other half and no overlap, that block counted as having 2 providers, and hence artificially high.)\n\nEven if AT&amp;T broke away, the vast majority of American's wouldn't be able to benefit.\n\nIf there were many ISP options, we would be having a conversation similar to what you're discussion. However, we don't.  municipal networks are illegal in many states. Franchise agreements make it illegal/impossible for other ISPs to server certain areas.  We do not have a healthy market.",

Wouldn't these big web hosts simply pay the cable companies to whitelist all of their servers? Even moreso because it would be a strong competitive advantage for web hosts to be able to say \"host with us and everyone will be able to see your site!\"\n\nIt still sucks, and the costs of some hosting plans might go up, but it's not exactly a doomsday scenario. Perhaps I'm missing something?",

Both are hard to say for sure.\n\nWhat's probable is we'll see very little activity for quite some time because the telecoms will want to cement their gains and positions while falsely reassuring everyone things are totally chill. But there could be things like accessibility barriers. Or fast lane services for businesses so while you may or may not have to pay those directly. Overall costs of doing business online will go up. And generally speaking smaller businesses will be prone to proportionately higher rates.\n\nDoomsday scenarios come way later after the whole shit show is in full swing. Breach our agreement, we cut your service, or slow it way down. Cost for reinstatement. Or idk, how about we're not partnered with this telecom anymore because we won't pay their rates so 1/3 of America can't view your site without a per visit fee. Point being, so much is possible without very stern protections. And telecom greed knows no bounds.",

The same people trying to kill net neutrality have created regulation that makes it nearly impossible to recreate he infrastructure; you can't just dig cable tunnels throughout the city. Pretty much a joke that killing net neutrality would spark competition and innovation.",

That It's a monopoly by about 2 corporations that are RENOWN for being hated by the masses for errors, overpriced, rising costs, and charges for services that previously were granted (data caps). In many areas of the US, consumers only have ONE cable giant to choose from. No market options, control, competition. They must be running out of ways to increase profits, if they're going as far as charging per website.\n  \nMaybe Cable should be regulated more like a utility, to prevent more package deals and divided costs to 'raise profit lines' for these monopolies. (Portugal telecom companies now have different packages based on 'websites used'. You want the entire internet? Pay more. You want to be included in our package deals? Pay us a special lump sum behind closed doors. ",

But I\u2019m completely bottlenecked by the amount of operational fires I have to put out each day.\n\nI know I need to hire, but I absolutely suck at it and I\u2019m not getting better. I\u2019m good at interviewing, selecting, onboarding\u2026 but getting enough candidates\u2026 I just can\u2019t. And I\u2019m not talking about leadership positions (I actually think I\u2019d be better at that), I\u2019m talking about hiring operational and low level transactional people to run the multiple processes that are running over me all the time.\n\nFor example, I created a position in linkedin for a junior admin position, super detailed post etc. got 34 applications, only 1 was worth interviewing, and 0 hires. And now I don\u2019t know how to source another 100 applications so that I could at least have 3 more interviews at that conversion rate.\n\nHow do I learn that skill.",

If anything, I've had too many applicants. \n2. If possible, make the position remote.\n3. Show some personality in the job description. Differentiate yourself by demonstrating the culture in the way you talk about the company and position.\n4. If you have a marketing department, involve them in the process. They will know how to create effective messaging that encourages action. They'll also have ideas for where to promote the listing.\n\nTo help with the quality of your applicants:\n\n1. Include a salary range in the job description to weed out unqualified applicants.\n2. Indeed includes and allows you to require assessments to apply. I would limit this to one assessment per post. They have assessments for specific roles and skills, like digital marketing, attention to detail, customer service, etc.",

As your business grows and you need more and more resources, it will be impossible to have both direct oversight of everything and do all detailed work, including those detailed job descriptions for each junior you are trying to find. \n\nAlso, once you have someone in charge of a certain area of the business, the \u201cchemistry\u201d of new hires needs to complement the leader of the function, otherwise it seems you are searching for hires with the expectation that all would be reporting directly to you. \n\nI guess it all depends on your vision for the business, but if you run around doing everything in all areas of the business and expect to deal with each employee yourself then you need to make sure all of them have the skills to cater to your vision directly. But if you strive for growth (which I read between the lines of your post) you need to empower others in the organisation, and for them to step up, become leaders themselves and take responsibility by demonstrating good judgement.\n\nEdit: apologies, I realised I haven\u2019t actually answered your question, but many others have provided options for actual recruiters to help with finding the right candidates.",

And I sincerely hope you find someone. \n\nBased on the way you\u2019re typing, it seems like you need someone to offload some of the operational work from your shoulders, and also have a managerial role in your business. It\u2019s always better to hire someone proactively (without rushing through the process) then to bring on someone AFTER you feel burned out. It also makes it easier for the recruit to catch up and understand your processes with ample time.\n\nThat being said, I know plenty of hyper talented marketing leaders who you can hire for a monthly subscription. The context here is that I created a platform just for this, to relieve the stress for folks just like you (coincidentally). Link in my bio!\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t want to hire someone, and just need someone to vent to, I would love to hop on a call with you and help you figure things out! On the house, on me. No ulterior motive and I won\u2019t even talk about my own business.\n\nRooting for you dude \ud83e\ude75",

Well eventualy i tell him hey you need to at least follow the install video, the way you did it makes the product look very bad. honestly dont konw how bad you could mess that up, its very simple. he said sorry and redid it. then he tells me \"this product is so amazing, i cant belive how useful this is, this is incredible\" then he proceeds to talk about it on facebook groups, and i get this 900% spike in sales. i traced all the sales back to the state he lived in so i konw they are from his postings (state specific automotive groups). Anyway, maybe you can focus more on getting the community to sell your stuff, ask customers to become 'partners'. for me i do amazon so its easy for them to setup an affilate link.",

Be more open to interviewing people. That\u2019s where you really learn whether someone can do the job you want or not.

If so, you could have someone working for you by next week, without the hassle of worrying about holiday or benefits. \n\nFinally, decide if you need a \u2018bum on seat\u2019 type person, or someone who can take real ownership of set tasks with a view of progressing within the company - this should determine your decision making, interview process, compensation, and how you sell the role to the applicant.",

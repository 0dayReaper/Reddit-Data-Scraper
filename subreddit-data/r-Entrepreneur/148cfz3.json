    "postText": "Hey,\n\nThis was driving me a little bit crazy for a while, but I've finally proven I'm not mad. Some screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/XRgVTyk\n\nI've noticed for a few weeks I've been targeted on places like Instagram and Twitter by a network of basically identical-looking websites.\n\nItems include the typical \"cool\" looking cheap gadgets you might otherwise expect to see advertised on Insta these days \u2013 I get the vibe that if the item ever actually arrived, it'll be terrible quality. Examples include:\n\n\\- Flexible drill extension kit (e.g. https://razo.co/product/last-day-promotion-50-off-flexible-drill-extension-kit/)\n\n\\- All-purpose car cup holder\n\n\\- Magic window cleaning brush\n\n\\- Wireless handheld vacuum cleaner\n\nAll of the website are virtually identical:\n\n\\- Logos are very similar (nearly indistinguishable at a glance)\n\n\\- All products are cheap tat\n\n\\- No identifiable information anywhere on the site, no address or contact details\n\n\\- Domains registered end of 2022\n\n\\- &lt;500 followers on Twitter (all followers are clearly fake accounts)\n\n\\- All using the same website template\n\n\\- Lots of fake-looking reviews (for example 5 stars with \"I just purchased all! Love them\")\n\n\\- All Twitter accounts were verified in April 2023\n\n\\- Spun content everywhere from Twitter bios to website content\n\nHere you can see an example of one of their Twitter profiles, and if you look at \"Similar to Raze\" you'll see some of the other sites clearly within their network: https://twitter.com/i/connect\\_people?user\\_id=1640294684177362947\n\nI imagine it's simply a big dropshipping operation, but given the number of websites in their network, I can't help but think there could be a more sinister reason (could it be a phishing operation)?\n\nSo many questions!\n\n\\- Who is running this?\n\n\\- Why run so many identical websites instead of just one (or maybe two!)?\n\n\\- Do the items ever arrive if ordered?\n\n\\- How much money are they spending on ads? I see them all the time!\n\nHas anyone also noticed these? What's going on?",

First thing that comes to mind is dropshipping. \n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing is likely a coordinated black hat social ad account farming ad blitz.\n\nSince dropshipping is typically not the most high margin business, it could actually be even more black hat than violating TOS, it could be outright CC theft. \n\nFarming is typically self-creation or purchasing of mass accounts. \n\nHow they\u2019re funding ads is totally separate, though. None of us know.",

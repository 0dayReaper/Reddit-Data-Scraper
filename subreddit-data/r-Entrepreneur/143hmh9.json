Some skill is needed, but mostly just boldness.\n\nOption 1 (harder): Find someone (a broker or owner) selling a business.  Narrow their target buyer and cold contact them.\n\nOption 2 (easier): Find a business buyer that either has their buying criteria available or ask them.  Go find businesses that meet their criteria either looking on-market or cold contacting.\n\nCharge the seller 1-5% of the total transaction, or work in an equity deal with your buyer.\n\nI\u2019ve been at this for 8 months, haven\u2019t closed one deal, yet I\u2019m on my 3rd attempt and much closer to succeeding than the first two.   I\u2019ve also gained a mentor and 2 clients hunting for businesses to buy.",

At least with sustainable shops.",

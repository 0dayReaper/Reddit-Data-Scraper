    "postText": "Hi Everyone. My business partner and I have a fitness class that we intend to run all around LA County in beaches and parks. We have discovered that the commercial permit process in each city is different and in some cities (Long Beach), currently non-existent. \n\nWe also discovered that for beaches, there is a process for obtaining such a business permit through the County. But at the same time, certain cities also require some kind of permits and payment to the city for commercial use of the beach. So there is some confusion that we have about possible legal crossovers between the county and cities for these permits. \n\nAnother intention we have is to hire several personal trainers to instruct our classes in parks and beaches. So, we are looking to obtain some kind of general permit for our business under which the personal trainers can operate. \n\nWe would like to make the process of obtaining as many of these permits for LA County based beaches and parks as efficient as possible. \n\nCan anyone point us in the right direction or give us general advice on how we should approach all of this?\n\nThank you!!!",

Obviously this is only if you don\u2019t get a clear answer here.\n\nOther than that, there is only one product I would ever recommend for an industry that I\u2019m not in, and it\u2019s GymLaunch. I\u2019m not sure if your biz would qualify, but I know a good amount of people who scaled their fitness biz out big time with them\u2026..\n\nI actually go to their events and I don\u2019t even own a gym lol\u2026..they just really understand customer acquisition and retention so well to the point where it transfers to other businesses, lol (really all the same shit anyway). \n\nSo yeah, just figured I\u2019d toss that in.",

Until you know what you've got as far as a business, you really don't want to bog yourself down with red tape if it's not endangering anyone's health or safety",

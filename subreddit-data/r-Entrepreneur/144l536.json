My parents made me save all of my birthday and Christmas money from my grandma, grandpa, uncles and other things like my Communion and Confirmation... etc. This was my college savings account.\n\nSo in 1994 I told dad to put it all into Apple stock like Forrest did. He did.   \nApple stock was $0.25 per share in 1994. Now it's $180.00 per share. \n\nIn 1994 I had $10,000 in my college account and dad put it all into Apple stock that is worth $7.2million today.\n\nIt was so easy.",

The alternative is making $10 an hour bagging groceries.\n\nAnd you can always get a new customer and fire your old one or raise the rates on them.

    "postText": "I\u2019ll save you the long form word vomit and just get to the bullet points so you can see what worked for us and replicate it in your own business.\n\n*(if you sell even half decent physical goods you can follow this exact formula &amp; get comparable results.)*\n\nAlright, the company sells travel backpacks targeted at photographers &amp; videographers. Product primarily used to store and transport camera gear &amp; film equipment.\n\nIn January the store hit $18K in monthly revenue purely from the owner's efforts of posting in online communities, making videos on a YouTube channel, Google search ads, &amp; running Facebook Ads on a low daily spend that would \"crap out\" if he tried scaling beyond $100/day.\n\n**Here is how we took the store to $260K/mo just 5 months later:**\n\n\\- Mass outreach (via e-mails &amp; cold DM) to nano &amp; micro influencers in photography niche on TikTok, Instagram, &amp; YouTube.\n\n\\- We offered them free product in exchange for content &amp; a mention IF they truly like the product. The messaging &amp; tone used during outreach will determine your open rates &amp; responses. Less is more.\n\n\\- If a creator didn't opt for the free product alone but was responsive &amp; interested in collaborating, we offered budget-friendly paid sponsorship that was not supposed to look or feel like a sponsorship. The payment depended on the creator's content quality, audience size, &amp; engagement rate.\n\n\\- All collaborations were content-oriented. They had to be entertaining, engaging, &amp; educational with no emphasis on driving sales, pushing discounts, or artificial scarcity. \"Just make stuff your audience will watch &amp; enjoy.\" This approach works especially well with TikTok right now since good content can gain traction organically.\n\n\\- Example: One of the creators we hired does wildlife photography &amp; documents the behind-the-scenes on his TikTok. He brought the backpack along for one of his trips and was just honest about it and how it was sent to him.  Gave a genuine review where he listed the pros &amp; just one minor con which the owner has since fixed.\n\n\\- We were netting an average 7x return on these influencer collaborations. We calculated this via **attributed revenue** divided by (**cost of goods gifted** plus **payments to influencers**).\n\n\\- Here's where things got very interesting... \ud83d\udd25\n\n\\- We got permissions from all creators to use their content for commercial purposes, advertising, etc. All of the content we were receiving was sent to our video editors to be cut up, reordered into different sequences, overlayed with a voiceover &amp; turned into ad creatives.\n\n\\- The secret to paid advertising is LOTS of creative variations (multivariate testing) and focusing on 2-3 platforms where you can really excel and go all in. Most 8 &amp; 9 figure brands I've worked with started with 1 offer on 1 platform &amp; many still run that (among other campaigns) to this day. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\".\n\n\\- You also have to adapt your ad creative to the placement platform. What works on TikTok may not translate well to Facebook and vice versa. For TikTok &amp; IG Reel placements, we write a voiceover script and try to tell stories involving the product. This is the format users trust &amp; engage with.\n\n\\- At this point in our journey, the company that couldn't spend &gt;$100/day on ads profitably was now spending $500/day at 3.5x ROAS. What changed? The quality of the creative and the amount of creative tests launched. More volume = more rolls of the dice = more chances of outliers that outperform everything else.\n\n\\- Prior to seriously scaling ads we wanted to ensure the backend was optimized. Two key areas to focus on are CVO (customer value optimization) and CRO (conversion rate optimization).\n\n\\- **CVO Optimizations that worked well:** To anyone who didn't take the pre-purchase upsell on the product page, we offered it at a discount post-purchase. We also offered a 2nd identical backpack, post-purchase, at a deep discount. \"So your travel partner doesn't feel left out.\" Surprisingly we had a 6% take rate which was insane since it's not a cheap product. Split test your upsells for maximum AOV. Outside of that, we rewrote the e-mail sequences to better reactivate customers but we're limited in what we can do to increase LTV until the owner launches new products.\n\n\\- **CRO Optimizations that worked well:** We wrote &amp; designed a new dedicated landing page for cold traffic. Took away walls of text / bloat and replaced it with visual content. We added in a bold branded guarantee that was specific to the product and instilled confidence. \"We're so sure you'll love this, we'll do blank, blank, &amp; blank\". We also filtered reviews to prioritize the most content-rich &amp; context-rich reviews. Personal stories &amp; experiences showcased via videos &amp; photos. Reviews that site visitors feel represented by and can relate to. Most importantly, we also added in a FAQ section on the bottom and took inspiration for common questions from competitors' sites &amp; Amazon listings of similar products. Below the FAQ we added another strong call to action. All of this effort took the conversion rate from 1.4% to 3.6% to the same traffic source (controlled experiment).\n\n\\- We were finally ready to start cranking up the heat and begin scaling. We started pushing through more advertising spend and increasing budgets daily until we started to hit resistance and diminishing returns. Between the organic sales from influencer content and our paid advertising, the store did $260K in revenue last month. (This excludes wholesale/retail sales).\n\n\\- **What's next for this store?** We start scaling paid ads horizontally &amp; increase spend on platforms like Snapchat, YouTube, &amp; Pinterest. For placements like Pinterest &amp; native ads, we'll be creating advertorials. And of course, we will continue creator collaborations at scale and slowly start breaking into bigger influencers and podcasts. Once new products are launched &amp; the company can extract a higher AOV and LTV, we will be more comfortable scaling further since the higher acquisition costs won't cut that deep into profits. The goal is also to get the flagship product listed on various online marketplaces like Amazon &amp; Walmart for residual sales and look into scaling internationally in the next 3 months. Oh, and there's an exciting \"YouTube SEO\" strategy we'll be testing out so fingers crossed.\n\nIf there's enough interest, I will do a follow-up post after the next 5 months and share what's been working for us yet again. I will also be here on Reddit occasionally and answer any questions as they arise. Good luck everyone.",

How do you charge this client to adequately compensate you for all the manual behind the scenes work (and creative thinking) the client has no idea exists to pull this result off?\n\n2. Given what I\u2019ve said, aren\u2019t you tempted to just run campaigns on your own paid products? The product is the easier part, what you brought to the table is the hard part.",

Especially since the entire industry is plagued by dudes who were told to \"start an agency\" by Tai Lopez (or one of those) and have little to no passion for marketing. Their entire goal is to make a quick buck. They overpromise &amp; lie like crazy to get a client then outsource the work overseas. This doesn't work, isn't scalable, and isn't honest. Then on the flip side, any \"fancy\" agencies that pride themselves on creativity and will \"think on your behalf\" will have an office where the chairs are upside down. They try to bill you $1K/hour so a guy named Steve can talk your ear off about NFTs &amp; other nonsense. To answer your question. We sort of have to tell clients to \"trust us\" and let the results speak for themselves. We also have workmanship guarantees &amp; such where we continue working at no extra charge until a minimal X result is hit.\n2. So this is another good one. I've been at this for over 8 years. The last 6-7 as a full on agency. You say that the product is the \"easier part\" but I'd argue that we all have our strengths and our weaknesses. We tried launching brands under the umbrella of our agency and the 3 times we had decent success, it always ended with the product not being \"good enough\" for anyone to genuinely recommend it to friends or to reorder after buying once. So despite our awesome marketing efforts &amp; making something irresistible, if the product itself isn't the best, it will not work in the long term. You can only sell so many fidget spinners &amp; \"knick knacks\". So instead, I told myself that I will work with people who are passionate and grow their companies while raising capital for a future endeavor I can be proud of. In short, unless I'm building something awesome that I'm passionate about and that is genuinely great for society, I probably won't do it. It's on my mind but for the time being I am grateful for the business I have that continues to provide for me. We literally make people money which is a rare business to be in &amp; very fruitful if you know what you're doing.\n\nThanks for those great questions. You actually made me think back &amp; reflect on life and the journey that lead us here. Very thought provoking. Thank you.",

As far as doing the outreach itself, it is pretty simple. Most influencers in the frame of mind to accept new work &amp; collaborations have their e-mail &amp; contact info on their profile or associated with themselves.\n\nYou just do cold outreach &amp; open the line of communication. If this was relationships, this is the point you try to grab a coffee, not make a marriage proposal. Keep it simple, friendly, &amp; respectful, and you'll be able to come to an agreement.\n\nIn terms of permissions to use their content for ads, I'm not a legal expert and unsure of where your company is located but there are pretty standard release forms or disclosures that can accomplish this. Definitely don't just run stuff as paid ads without prior permissions.\n\nGood luck with your brand! Over 200k followers on Instagram is a great start. I'd definitely get onto TikTok and go heavy on posting content there. Even though IG has been better lately after algorithm updates, TikTok is still the king for organic reach, viral potential, &amp; much less competition.",

Aka, profit margins drop.\n\nHowever, because you are acquiring customers &amp; now have tangible data like their e-mail address and an existing touch point with them, it is easy to monetize that customer on the backend.\n\n\"The profit is made on the backend\" - I'm sure you saw this quote before. It's very relevant in the eCommerce space.\n\nThis brand at $18K/mo was breaking even because the owner did a series of trade shows that didn't pay off. If you exclude those costs, you're looking at sub 20% profit margin.\n\nHowever, that profit margin greatly increased as we got to $260K due to 2 reasons. #1 - the owner got a FAR superior deal from the supplier due to the increased volume. #2 - we were now selling more units of product per customer so minimal increase in shipping cost but HUGE increase in revenue. Profit margin in the sense of revenue minus cogs minus ad spend is 36% in June.\n\nHope that answers your question. However, I must emphasize that profit really doesn't matter that much as long as you can at least break even and acquire a brick ton of customers. (&amp; eat ramen for a while lol.)",

Because if they don\u2019t, and you have to pay Zuckerberg (or some affiliate) each time you want a sale, you can forget about those \u201cmultiple\u201d years of profit.\n\nHeck, you\u2019re competing with brands that have funding and are willing to take losses to acquire customers. And people here are asking about the profit margins of the backpack company as if that negates the success of going from 18k/mo to 260k/mo.\n\nMy point was simply that it doesn\u2019t matter to the degree most novice entrepreneurs think it does, for a DTC startup in this specific predicament.",

The narrator keeps speaking but we'll show different reviews visually.\n\nOther than the \"weaving\" part of it, you also want to repurpose your existing content to make lots of new ads. So you don't have to get \"bogged down\" to 1 specific video just because it has a narration and others don't. You can write a script and have a creator read the narration or even do an AI voiceover.\n\nThe main goal is that you have a drive folder of like 20 videos/photos and you turn that into 50-100 \"basically unique\" ad creatives.\n\nYou should play around with the intro hook, swap out a different call to action, and prioritize different selling points / angles in different ads.\n\nYou'd be surprised at what can make all the difference. We had one ad where it had 3x the rate of \"3 second views\" of all the other ads. It ended up being that there was a weird looking elbow at the start which people mistook for something else. Stuff like this happens all the time &amp; it's difficult to plan. You just have to throw a lot of good stuff against the wall and see what sticks.\n\nGood luck. Most important thing is to start. Don't worry about making 50 variations right now if you don't even have the content for it. Just try to make 1 good ad. Then try to make a 2nd one. And so on.",

You will see that, if left to their own accord, most \"unseasoned\" influencers will literally speak differently when they're talking about a product because they have to versus when they want to and aren't being paid to do so.\n\nMost don't do this intentionally and think it is in fact what YOU, the brand, want them to do. Especially since they subconsciously learned this by watching bigger influencers who they aspire to be like.\n\nIn reality, content is content. Nobody likes being sold stuff. Most people can smell when someone is being disingenuous from a mile away and it is an immediate turn off.\n\nWe simply do more work on our end - behind the scenes - to best equip the influencer to be comfortable, authentic, &amp; make the content they enjoy making. We do this with PDFs, guidelines, and making our staff accessible to them whenever they're unsure about something. This effort produces disproportionate returns.\n\nAnd to your question about a call to action and discount codes. It really depends. With some creators, our intention is to sell to their existing audience and then we'll commonly use discount codes and be more direct. With others, we're simply trying to create viral content through the creator. In those instances we do not provide any specific links, codes, or have any specific CTA.\n\nThe best influencer marketing strategy is one that incorporates both of these types of collaborations.\n\n// Oh, I keep seeing more questions within your comment lol. The outreach approach is similar for TikTok and YouTube, but no, with YouTube we have different guidelines. Their algorithm is completely different and more \"demand-oriented\". We work with creators to make sure they understand search keywords, YouTube SEO, &amp; things like that.\n\nHope that answers your questions. I swear I tried to make this a short answer haha.",

That's the hardest part. It's also hard due to the mental battle of it all.\n\nYou redesign a logo for the 8th time or play around with the colors of your Shopify theme. You do a bunch of actions that are pretty much meaningless and don't move the needle. And you do them because that's the only thing within your control at the moment and you have zero feedback to work with.\n\nSo to answer your question...\n\nI would \"move fast &amp; break things\" and just get whatever MVP you have out to the world by launching an ad on a low daily budget and sending you product out to some nano/micro influencers and trying to get them to post about it free of charge if they're nice enough to do so.\n\nGet your product in people's hands but don't overdo it either. This is a very crucial and fragile time because you can easily get ahead of yourself and end up in a bad situation.\n\nIf you start gaining traction, you want to be leveraging surveys &amp; making sure the product is delivered well and customers are having a good experience.\n\nThe absolute worst thing that can happen is getting ahead of yourself and selling a bunch of orders only to find out there's a fundamental problem you didn't account for and now you have a series of chargebacks, refunds, etc. Payment processors are holding your money and social media platforms where you were advertising are now banning you, your ad accounts, &amp; blacklisting you.\n\nHope that somewhat answers your question. In short, nano influencers have disproportionate returns and low cost so I would start there. I would use the content they make to get your ads started on a low daily spend. Then, I wouldn't scale anything until you had a solid and smooth operation in place.\n\nAs far as which platforms to advertise on in the beginning... depends who your customers are. Most likely Facebook, Instagram, &amp; TikTok. Still the best to this day despite rising CPMs and tracking issues. Good luck.",

So it is actually \"preferred\" for most brands to scale to the wall until they hit break even and just acquire customers which they can monetize on the backend.\n\nIt was below 20% at $18K/mo and due to the CVO work we've done that I mentioned in the post, we brought it to 36% where it was in June.\n\nDue to supply chain issues, I believe the last two weeks have been declining in profit margin due to COGs alone. This is an issue that is being resolved by the owner &amp; that I am not directly involved in so can't speak on it.\n\ntl:dr don't let the specific number percentage point of profit distract from the tactics I freely shared in this post that are genuinely working if you apply them.",

You're spot on with that one. The owner is currently combatting that with further packaging products that would go inside the backpack (think toiletry bag etc) as well as modular options for specific equipment.\n\nObviously the long term play is to do all sorts of laptop bags, camera cases, etc. It'll be tough for sure but at the same time sort of exciting.",

The way we're addressing this to be able to hit that $500K/mo mark, for example, is to expand onto new platforms and new markets (internationally).\n\nWe could also just crank up spend where we already spend, but it would just shoot the CPA up and decrease profitability. Even if we hit $500K/mo through those means, rather than the proper process, the profit margins would be non-existent and there would be heaps of wasted ad spend.\n\nOther than that, there is just a lot of backend optimization on the business owner's side that has to take place. New products, more things to upsell &amp; compliment the flagship product, etc. We are very limited right now in how we can monetize each customer so acquiring customers, prior to being \"fully ready\" can be a bit counterintuitive.\n\nHope that explains it.",

One thing to keep in mind is that e-mail automations (e-mail at scale) is very different from the B2B purposes you're describing.\n\nFor these DTC brands, we work with e-mail flows, sequences, etc. Everything from cart abandons to win-back &amp; even referral requests / post purchase surveys.\n\nHowever, you'll be pleased to know that the same universal laws apply. In B2B if you send a long boring e-mail full of technical jargon, not only will it likely end up in spam, if the receiver miraculously opens it they will immediately close out and move on.\n\nThe same thing applies in the B2C world. Humans are humans. We're very conversational, short-form, and get to the point.\n\nAnd most importantly, just because we're in B2C instead of B2B, we don't forget about morals and authenticity. Many brands quickly forget that customers are very real people, even if there are tens of thousands of them. So you can really harm your brand if you use false scarcity or other such \"bogus\" tactics.\n\nAs far as what e-mail content is actually considered \"GOOD\". Tbh the same stuff that would trend on Reddit or online communities. Good faith posts full of education &amp; entertainment. To crush e-mail marketing, do the opposite of the pesky e-mails you yourself hate receiving. \"10% OFF LABOR DAY\" - No thanks. Lol.\n\n\\^ oh just saw the part about statistics. I mean it varies based on brand. This specific company had 5-10% open rates because the owner didn't give it the time of day and was trying to do it himself. We cleaned up the e-mails, followed the advice mentioned above, and we're seeing 25-30% open rates. 10-15% link-click rate. Usually 2-5% conversion rate. (Each of those numbers is percentage out of total recipients.) So if we send an e-mail to 25,000 people, we expect 500-1,250 to buy the offer. Obviously the conversion rate decreases as the frequency of e-mails sent increases, and vice versa. Depending on amount of SKUs a brand sells, we can do anywhere from 1-3 e-mails per week. That can get a little higher towards Q4.\n\nLet me know if any further questions :)",

Our goal is that their potential is great enough to produce content that people will watch &amp; share.\n\nOften times, their page and existing content may not always represent the potential. You'd be surprised. We've had a girl with under 2K followers on TikTok make a video for us that ended up reaching over 800K people.

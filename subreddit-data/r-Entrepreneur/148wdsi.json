    "postText": "Why don't people talk about email marketing more?   \n\n\nprobably cuz it feels boring. I get most don't see it as sexy. But my god, imho email marketing is the sexiest beast in the marketing world! the hidden gem, the missing piece to scaling your business.   \n\n\nYou're emails (IF you send them) are stale and stiff - they lack character and people don't wanna read them. You're not utilizing email marketing correctly and you're missing out big time on extra $$$.  \n\n\nEmail is bigger than any social media. It's the old school method that is still very much alive and well today. I mean, duh - right? This is so obvious. But IF it's so damn obvious, why don't more businesses do it right?  \n\n\nWell they are doing it but they're doing it wrong.  \n\n\nYou gotta stop the tired old offers like '30% oFf' or 'BuY oNe GeT oNe FrEe' - just stop. It feels like an ad and your conversion rates are gunna be shit.   \n\n\nWhen crafting an email, ditch the fancy graphics and opt for text. Yes, plain old text. But not just any text \u2013 make it fun, down-to-earth, and relatable if you can. Find the 'tone' of your business and keep things more informal. This is how you emotionally connect with your audience - NOT by sending them a gd ad. (no offense)\r  \n\r  \nIf you're a small business owner, you can try writing the emails in first person ('hey guys! John from Johns Apples here!'). Your conversion rates and LTV will shoot up bc of the personal connection (I've seen this happen personally with a businesses I've helped - click through rates going from 1% to 3% after switching to the personal touch method I'm talking about!). That personal touch goes a LOOOOONG way in connecting with your audience and eventually driving additional revenue.  \n\n\nBut enough about sales! I know it's hard but stop thinking about selling, if only for a minute! Give your email subscribers something for free. Send them to a Facebook giveaway where all they need to do is 'like the post to enter for a chance to win.' Simplicity is key. To start things off, do a nice and clean little 'hello here's something for free you might like - link - good luck!' and then that'll create good vibes around your email and people will start to look for new emails from your company and open them right away!\r  \n\r  \nOnce you've warmed them up, start sharing more about your business from a personal standpoint. You could do weekly or monthly updates, whatever you feel is best. Talk about upcoming products or any behind-the-scenes stuff. Mix it up with valuable content if you can, maybe even a link to a private LIVE video where you have a special offer or a big giveaway (you can tell I like giveaways - they're great for building a bond with your audience). When it comes to selling, hold off for just a bit. \"Give, give, give... then ask.\" The more you've given your audience for free before asking, the more it'll hit when you finally 'ask.'\r  \n\r  \nAfter providing value for a while, it's time to introduce a special offer and finally drive sales. I like to call them 'flash deals' :) Basically it'll be a limited item that's available for a set amount of time - usually no more than 24 hrs or less. If it sells out it sells out, you won't be bringing this item back ever again! (use that in the copy to drive hype). If this is your first sales email after all that giving, there will be a lot of attention around this deal - and you can lean into it building hype (send an email a few days before the deal letting people know it's coming, then when it sells out follow up w another email thanking the buyers and saying its no longer available).   \n\n\n  \nok now bear with me, THIS IS WHERE THE MONEY COMES IN ----&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL IN THE UPSELLS! You need juicy offers on the 'back end' of the flash deal.   \n\n\nOffer them an epic deal (a for real good offer) - then have additional 'upsells' on the backend (turns out the easiest sale you can make it to someone whose already buying from you!)  \n\n\nIf the first flash deal is actually a damn good deal - then a lot of people will buy it and then they'll see the upsells and a certain percentage of them will buy those things too which bumps order value. (Example: $5 t-shirt- $14 glow-in-the-dark headband - $35 hoodie - $130 'only 10 available mega bundle.' By offering the initial good deal - all those people will see the other offers and even if a small % buy the add-ons it bumps the order value significantly.)  \n\r  \nThese upsells are a fucking game-changer. In my own personal business, I've added flash deals and saw revenue increase by over 100% (it was a subscription box at $13/month - but our customers were spending over $20 a month on the deals! so at the time we had 2k subs and our allocated monthly revenue - bc some paid annual so not all monthly subscribers - went from 26k a month to 66k! It really helped us take off).   \n\n\nIf you really wanna get into it, eventually as your audience grows and your brand strengthens, consider launching a subscription box. (I'm goin deep here but this will apply to some people with the right audience!). Besides being able to kick off a new revenue stream right from your email list if done right, you can then start to offer free shipping to your subscribers whenever you have a flash deal as the items can ship free in the subscription box. \r  \n\r  \nKeep nurturing your audience and see what other magic emails can do. If you have a good relationship with your people them you can send out polls to gauge their interests of this or that, or you could invite them to a private Facebook group where they can connect with each other (and you). The possibilities are endless if you're effectively communicating with them.\r  \n\r  \nEmails are powerful stuff. I once had a toy subscription box business with around 4,000 subscribers. We decided to launch a sister company with a lower-priced subscription box, somewhat related in the same niche. We hyped it up to our email list, gave them an irresistible deal ('try it free and if you don't like it we'll give you a 100% full refund and let you keep it for free'), and bam! Over a thousand members signed up in the opening weekend. Literally instant 6 figure business (later grew to 7 figures).\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, I'm always down to chat if you really wanna get into it more! If you have a big list and haven't done anything with it, you're seriously missing out! This advice is really mostly geared towards people with a larger existing audience - but it can be applied to smaller audiences as well. Start by giving! It'll come back 100x.",

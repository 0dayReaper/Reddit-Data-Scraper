    "postText": "Hi I am moving from a small town to a big city (LA westside) this week and I'm making a resolution to get off my computer for the first time ever and go outside and connect with people to grow my freelance studio. So far as an entrepreneur I've only done online things... SEO Facebook ads and things like that. Big time hermit. If anyone can share any tips or stuff that's worked for you in this regard that'd be really nice.\n\nSome main things I am wondering is should I get business cards? Or maybe a QR code is good enough? Maybe some stickers?? Any tips for finding events or opportunities outside of Eventbrite and Meetup? Any mindset shifts that could be helpful?\n\nI'm a web designer and developer who works with tech entrepreneurs by the way.",

I keep repeating the phrase \"I am the owner, please stop calling me, please add me to a do not call list\" until they hang up but they still call 3-5 times a day every day.\n\n...or *is* it something I should just verify just to get them to shut up?\n\n...or is my scam radar broken and this is something I should actually listen to?  (I hate that they have started to wear me down and question my instincts but scammers would give up by now, right?)",

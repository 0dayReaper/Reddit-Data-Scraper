I have the idea, ways to execute, possible vendors, and good feedback from dog owners. \n\nAny advice?",

            "comment": "My advice to you would be to start with the basics like what your target market would be ie both in terms of region and age group, secondly the resources you would require ie digital and human, competitors, the gap in the market, vendors and maintaining fees, marketing and sales, pricing and revenue model along with management and legal support both in terms of cost and work. It would help you in the long run if you have some ideas on it.",

    "postText": "So I'm 17 and I'm looking to start something/anything asap that actually has a chance. I'm looking into software companies that sell to other companies (mailchimp, salesforce, etc) since they don't really require a lot of capital to start and they have a lot of market demand. I have some ideas which are slowly but steadily becoming clearer (work from home hr, data analysis) but I want to know what I can do to get something that somebody might just use in less than 500 hours of programming/what not? Mabye a better question is how do I code faster? xD\n\nAny answers are greatly appreciated!",

Even on the first and most superficial level, have you never heard of the no-code movement? Wouldn't that be 'faster.' Really this code first, ask questions later bullshit is vintage Build It And They Will Come.\n\nOnly you don't have Kevin Costner to carry the whole project to success on his back. Truth be told, when is Kevin Costner around when you need him? \n\nNext, people are in a hurry to 'get there,' only to find there is no 'there' when they arrive. They just want to do [random shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/eycm8w/need_a_bit_of_help_created_an_amazing_product/) and get their payoff. Well there is a payoff but it's [nothing like you imagine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/mupm4w/comment/gv8mh4q/?context=3).\n\nRandom shit is not an industry classification. Open for Business is no strategy.\n\nDo be careful what you ask for, plenty who wanted to start a business in the worst way got exactly what they asked for ...good and hard. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 isn't a skill ... you can stop practicing.",

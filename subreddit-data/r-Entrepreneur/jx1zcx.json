    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nThere's a TON of content out there on SEO - guides, articles, courses, videos, scams, people yelling about it on online forums, etc etc..\n\nMost of it, however, is super impractical. If you want to start doing SEO TODAY and start getting results ASAP, you'll need to do a TON of digging to figure out what's important and what's not.\n\nSo we wanted to make everyone's lives super easy and distill our EXACT process of working w/ clients into a stupid-simple, step-by-step practical guide. And so we did. Here we are.\n\n*P.S:*  r/startups*, and* r/seo *loved the guide, so I thought you guys might like it too.* \n\n# A bit of backstory:\n\n*If you guys haven't seen any of my previous posts, me and my co-founder own an SEO/digital marketing agency, and we've worked w/ a ton of clients helping them go from 0 to 200k+ monthly organic traffic. We've also helped some quite big companies grow their organic traffic (from 1M to over 1.8M monthly organic), using the exact same process.*\n\nSo without further ado, grab your popcorn, and be prepared to stick to the screen for a while, cause this is going to be a long post. Here's everything I am going to cover:\n\n* Get your website to run and load 2x - 5x faster (with MINIMAL technical know-how)\n* Optimize your landing pages to rank for direct intent keywords (and drive 100% qualified leads)\n* Create amazing, long-form content that ranks every time\n* How we get a TON of links to our website with ZERO link-building efforts\n* How to improve your content\u2019s rankings with Surfer SEO\n\n# Step #1 - Technical Optimization and On-Page SEO\n\nStep #1 to any SEO initiative is getting your technical SEO right.\n\nNow, some of this is going to be a bit technical, so you might just forward this part to your tech team and just skip ahead to \"Step #2 - Keyword Research.\"\n\nIf you DON'T have a tech team and want a super easy tl;dr, do this:\n\n* Use WP Rocket. It's a WordPress plugin that optimizes a bunch of stuff on your website, making it run significantly faster.\n* Use SMUSH to (losslessly) compress all the images on your website. this usually helps a TON w/ load speed.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit more tech-savvy, though, read on!\n\n## Technical SEO Basics\n\n**Sitemap.xml file.** A good sitemap shows Google how to easily navigate your website (and how to find all your content!). If your site runs on WordPress, all you have to do is install YoastSEO or Rankmath SEO, and they\u2019ll create a sitemap for you. Otherwise, you can use an online XML Sitemap generation tool.\n\n**Proper website architecture.** The crawl depth of any page should be lower than 4 (i.e: any given page should be reached with no more than 3 clicks from the homepage). To fix this, you should improve your interlinking (check Step #6 of this guide to learn more).\n\n**Serve images in next-gen format.** Next-gen image formats (JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP) can be compressed a lot better than JPG or PNG images. Using WordPress? Just use Smush and it\u2019ll do ALL the work for you. Otherwise, you can manually compress all images and re-upload them.\n\n**Remove duplicate content.** Google hates duplicate content and will penalize you for it. If you have any duplicate pages, just merge them (by doing a 301 redirect) or delete one or the other.\n\n**Update your \u2018robots.txt\u2019 file.** Hide the pages you don\u2019t want Google to index (e.g: non-public, or unimportant pages). If you\u2019re a SaaS, this would be most of your in-app pages. \\]\n\n**Optimize all your pages by best practice**. There\u2019s a bunch of general best practices that Google wants you to follow for your web pages (maintain keyword density, have an adequate # of outbound links, etc.). Install YoastSEO or RankMath and use them to optimize all of your web pages.\n\nIf you DON\u2019T have any pages that you don\u2019t want to be displayed on Google, you DON\u2019T need robots.txt.\n\n## Advanced Technical SEO\n\nNow, this is where this gets a bit more web-devvy. Other than just optimizing your website for SEO, you should also focus on optimizing your website speed.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do that:\n\nBoth for Mobile and PC, your website should load in under 2-3 seconds. While load speed isn\u2019t a DIRECT ranking factor, it does have a very serious impact on your rankings.\n\nAfter all, if your website doesn\u2019t load for 5 seconds, a bunch of your visitors might drop off.\n\nSo, to measure your website speed performance, you can use Pagespeed Insights. Some of the most common issues we have seen clients facing when it comes to website speed and loading time, are the following:\n\n* **Images being resized with CSS or JS.** This adds extra loading time to your site. Use GTMetrix to find which images need resizing. Use an online tool (there are a ton of free ones) to properly resize images (or Photoshop even), and re-upload them.\n* **Images not being lazy-loaded.** If your pages contain a lot of images, you MUST activate lazy-loading. This allows images that are below the screen, to be loaded only once the visitor scrolls down enough to see the image.\n* **Gzip compression** **not enabled.** Gzip is a compression method that allows network file transfers to happen a ton faster. In other words, your files like your HTML, CSS, and JS load a ton faster.\n* **JS, CSS, and HTML not minified/aggregated/in-lined.** If your website is loading slowly because you have 100+ external javascript files and stylesheets being requested from the server, then you need to look into minifying, aggregating, and inlining some of those files.\n* **Use Cloudflare + BunnyCDN** Why the combo? Why not just Cloudflare? Well, I won't get into details, I've experimented a bit with it, and if you are looking for something cheap and fast this is the best combo. Cloudflare you can opt in for the free account. BunnyCDN on the other hand is on a pay-as-you-go basis, and unless you are getting over 100K+ visits a month, you'll likely never go above their minimum monthly threshold of $1.\n\nWant to make your life easier AND fix up all these issues and more? Use WP Rocket. The tool basically does all your optimization for you (if you\u2019re using WordPress, of course).\n\nLastly, i*f you want to validate the website speed optimization changes you've made, or if you simply want to test how your current site is performing, you can use* ***Google Page Speed Insights***\\*.\\*\n\n*In May 2020, Google rolled out its Core Web Vitals update, which in layman terms means starting next May (2021), the three most important website load speed metrics you will need to worry for ranking will be:*\n\n1. *LCP - Largest Contentful Paint -&gt; under 2.5s*\n2. *FID - First Input Delay -&gt; under 100ms*\n3. *CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift -&gt; under 0.1*\n\n# Step #2 - Keyword Research\n\nOnce your website is 100% optimized, it\u2019s time to define your SEO strategy.\n\nThe best way to get started with this is by doing keyword research.\n\nFirst off, you want to create a keyword research sheet. This is going to be your main hub for all your content operations.\n\nYou can use the sheet to:\n\n1. Prioritize content\n2. Keep track of the publishing process\n3. Get a top-down view of your web pages\n\nAnd here\u2019s what it covers:\n\n* **Target search phrase**. This is the keyword you\u2019re targeting.\n* **Priority**. What\u2019s the priority of this keyword? We usually divide them by 1-2-3\u2026\n   * Priority 3 - Top priority keywords. These are usually low competition, high traffic, well-converting, or all 3 at the same time.\n   * Priority 2 - Mid-priority keywords.\n   * Priority 1 - These are low priority.\n* **Status**. What\u2019s the status of the article? We usually divide them by\u2026\n   * 1 - Not written\n   * 2 - Writer has picked up the topic for the week\n   * 3 - The article is being written\n   * 4 - The article is in editing phase\n   * 5 - The article is published on the blog\n* **Topic cluster**. The category that the blog post belongs to.\n* **Monthly search volume**. Self-explanatory. This helps you pick a priority for the keyword.\n* **CPC (low &amp; high bid)**. Cost per click for the keyword. Generally, unless you\u2019re planning to run search ads, these are not mandatory. They can, however, help you figure out which of your keywords will convert better. **Pro tip:** the higher the CPC, the more likely it is for the keyword to convert well.\n\nNow that you have your sheet (and understand how it works), let\u2019s talk about the \u201chow\u201d of keyword research.\n\n## How to do Keyword Research (Step-by-Step Guide)\n\nThere are a ton of different ways to do that (check the \u201cfurther readings\u201d at the end of this section for a detailed rundown).\n\nOur favorite method, however, is as follows\u2026\n\nStart off by listing out your top 5 SEO competitors.\n\nThe key here is SEO competitors - competing companies that have a strong SEO presence in the same niche.\n\nNot sure who\u2019s a good SEO competitor? Google the top keywords that describe your product and find your top-ranking competitors.\n\nRun them through SEMrush (or your favorite SEO tool), and you\u2019ll see how well, exactly, they\u2019re doing with their SEO.\n\nOnce you have a list of 5 competitors, run each of them through \u201cOrganic Research\u201d on SEMrush, and you'll get a complete list of all the keywords they rank on.\n\nNow, go through these keywords one by one and extract all the relevant ones and add them to your sheet.\n\nOnce you go through the top SEO competitors, your keyword research should be around 80%+ done.\n\nNow to put some finishing touches on your keyword research, run your top keywords through UberSuggest and let it do its magic. It's going to give you a bunch of keywords associated with the keywords you input.\n\nGo through all the results it's going to give you, extract anything that\u2019s relevant, and your keyword research should be 90% done.\n\nAt this point, you can call it a day and move on to the next step. Chances are, over time, you\u2019ll uncover new keywords to add to your sheet and get you to that sweet 100%.\n\n# Step #3 - Create SEO Landing Pages\n\nRemember how we collected a bunch of landing page keywords in step #2? Now it\u2019s time to build the right page for each of them! This step is a lot more straightforward than you\u2019d think. First off, you create a custom landing page based on the keyword. Depending on your niche, this can be done in 2 ways:\n\n1. Create a general template landing page. Pretty much copy-paste your landing page, alter the sub-headings, paraphrase it a bit, and add relevant images to the use-case. You\u2019d go with this option if the keywords you\u2019re targeting are very similar to your main use-case (e.g. \u201cproject management software\u201d \u201cproject management system\u201d).\n2. Create a unique landing page for each use-case. You should do this if each use-case is unique. For example, if your software doubles as project management software and workflow management software. In this case, you\u2019ll need two completely new landing pages for each keyword.\n\nOnce you have a bunch of these pages ready, you should optimize them for their respective keywords.\n\nYou can do this by running the page content through an SEO tool. If you\u2019re using WordPress, you can do this through RankMath or Yoast SEO.\n\nBoth tools will give you exact instructions on how to optimize your page for the keyword.\n\nIf you\u2019re not using WordPress, you can use SurferSEO. Just copy-paste your web page content, and it\u2019s going to give you instructions on how to optimize it.\n\nOnce your new landing pages are live, you need to pick where you want to place them on your website. We usually recommend adding these pages to your website\u2019s navigation menu (header) or footer.\n\nFinally, once you have all these new landing pages up, you might be thinking \u201cNow what? How, and when, are these pages going to rank?\u201d\n\nGenerally, landing pages are a tad harder to rank than content. See, with content, quality plays a huge part. Write better, longer, and more informative content than your competition, and you\u2019re going to eventually outrank them even if they have more links.\n\nWith landing pages, things aren\u2019t as cut and dry. More often than not, you can\u2019t just \u201ccreate a better landing page.\u201d\n\nWhat determines rankings for landing page keywords are backlinks. If your competitors have 400 links on their landing pages, while yours has 40, chances are, you\u2019re not going to outrank them.\n\n# Step #4 - Create SEO Blog Content\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the other side of the coin: content keywords, and how to create content that ranks.\n\nAs we mentioned before, these keywords aren\u2019t direct-intent (the Googler isn\u2019t SPECIFICALLY looking for your product), but they can still convert pretty well. For example, if you\u2019re a digital marketing agency, you could rank on keywords like\u2026\n\n* Lead generation techniques\n* SaaS marketing\n* SEO content\n\nAfter all, anyone looking to learn about lead gen techniques might also be willing to pay you to do it for them.\n\nOn top of this, blog post keywords are way easier to rank for than your landing pages - you can beat competition simply by creating significantly better content without turning it into a backlink war.In order to create good SEO content, you need to do 2 things right:\n\n1. Create a comprehensive content outline\n2. Get the writing part right\n\nHere\u2019s how each of these work...\n\n## How to Create a Content Outline for SEO\n\nA content outline is a document that has all the info on what type of information the article should contain Usually, this includes:\n\n* Which headers and subheaders you should use\n* What\u2019s the optimal word count\n* What information, exactly, should each section of the article cover\n* If you\u2019re not using Yoast or Rankmath, you can also mention the SEO optimization requirements (keyword density, # of outbound links, etc.)\n\nOutlines are useful if you\u2019re working with a writing team that isn\u2019t 100% familiar with SEO, allowing them to write content that ranks without any SEO know-how.\n\nAt the same time, even if you\u2019re the one doing the writing, an outline can help you get a top-down idea of what you should cover in the article.\n\nSo, how do you create an outline? Here\u2019s a simplified step-by-step process\u2026\n\n1. Determine the target word count. Rule of thumb: aim for 1.5x - 2x whatever your competitor wrote. You can disregard this if your competition was super comprehensive with their content, and just go for the same length instead.\n2. Create a similar header structure as your competition. Indicate for the writer which headers should be h2, which ones h3.\n3. For each header, mention what it\u2019s about. Pro tip - you can borrow ideas from the top 5 ranking articles.\n4. For each header, explain what, exactly, should the writer mention (in simple words).\n5. Finally, do some first-hand research on Reddit and Quora. What are the questions your target audience has around your topic? What else could you add to the article that would be super valuable for your customers?\n\n## How to Write Well\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to good content than giving an outline to a writer. Sure, they can hit all the right points, but if the writing itself is mediocre, no one\u2019s going to stick around to read your article.\n\nHere are some essential tips you should keep in mind for writing content (or managing a team of writers):\n\n1. Write for your audience. Are you a B2B enterprise SaaS? Your blog posts should be more formal and professional. B2C, super-consumer product? Talk in a more casual, relaxed fashion. Sprinkle your content with pop culture references for bonus points!\n2. Avoid fluff. Every single sentence should have some sort of value (conveying information, cracking a joke, etc.). Avoid beating around the bush, and be as straightforward as possible.\n3. Keep your audience\u2019s knowledge in mind. For example, if your audience is a bunch of rocket scientists, you don\u2019t have to explain to them how 1+1=2.\n4. Create a writer guideline (or just steal ours! -&gt; edit: sorry had to remove link due to posting guidelines)\n5. Use Grammarly and Hemingway. The first is like your personal pocket editor, and the latter helps make your content easier to read.\n6. Hire the right writers. Chances are, you\u2019re too busy to write your own content. We usually recommend using ProBlogger or Cult of Copy Job Board (Facebook Group) to source top writing talent.\n\n# Step #5 - Start Link-Building Operations\n\nLinks are essential if you want your content or web pages to rank.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a competitive niche, links are going to be the final deciding factor on what ranks and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nIn the VPN niche, for example, everyone has good content. That\u2019s just the baseline. The real competition is in the backlinks.\n\nTo better illustrate this example, if you Google \u201cbest VPN,\u201d you\u2019ll see that all top-ranking content pieces are almost the same thing. They\u2019re all:\n\n* Well-written\n* Long-form\n* Easy to navigate\n* Well-formatted (to enhance UX)\n\nSo, the determining factor is links. If you check all the top-ranking articles with the Moz Toolbar Extension, you\u2019ll see that on average, each page has a minimum of 300 links (and some over 100,000!).\n\nMeaning, to compete, you\u2019ll really need to double-down on your link-building effort.\n\nIn fact, in the most competitive SEO niches, it\u2019s not uncommon to spend $20,000 per month on link-building efforts alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Pro Tip**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Got scared by the high $$$ some companies spend on link-building? Well, worry not!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Only the most ever-green niches are so competitive. Think, VPN, make money online, health and fitness, dating, CBD, gambling, etc. So you know, the usual culprits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For most other niches, you can even rank with minimal links, as long as you have top-tier SEO content.\n\nNow, let\u2019s ask the million-dollar question: *\u201chow do you do link-building?\u201d*\n\n# 4 Evergreen Link Building Strategies for Any Website\n\nThere are a TON of different link building strategies on the web. Broken link building, scholarship link building, stealing competitor links, and so on and so on and so on.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to list every single link building strategy out there (mainly because Backlinko already did that in their link building guide).\n\nWhat we are going to do, though, is list out some of our favorite strategies, and link you to resources where you can learn more:\n\n1. **Broken link building**. You find dead pages with a lot of backlinks, reach out to websites that linked to them, and pitch them something like \u201chey, you linked to this article, but it\u2019s dead. We thought you\u2019d want to fix that. You can use our recent article if you think it\u2019s cool enough.\u201d\n2. **Guest posting.** Probably the most popular link building strategy. Find blogs that accept guest posts, and send them a pitch! They usually let you include 1-2 do-follow links back to your website.\n3. \u201c**Linkable asset\u201d link building**. A linkable asset is a resource that is so AWESOME that you just can\u2019t help but link to. Think, infographics, online calculators, first-hand studies or research, stuff like that. The tl;dr here is, you create an awesome resource, and promote the hell out of it on the web.\n4. **Skyscraper technique**. The skyscraper technique is a term coined by Backlinko. The gist of it is, you find link-worthy content on the web, create something even better, and reach out to the right people.\n\nMost of these strategies work, and you can find a ton of resources on the web if you want to learn more.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re looking for something a bit different, oh boy we have a treat for you! We\u2019re going to teach you a link-building strategy that got us around:\n\n* 10,000+ traffic within a week\n* 15+ leads\n* 50+ links\n\n...And so much more, all through a *single* blog post.\n\n# Link-Building Case Study: SaaS Marketing\n\n*\u201cSo, what\u2019s this ancient link-building tactic?\u201d*\n\nI hear you asking. It must be something super secretive and esoteric, right?\n\nSecrets learned straight from the link-building monks at an ancient SEO temple\u2026\n\n*\u201cRight?\u201d*\n\nWell, not quite.\n\nThe tactic isn\u2019t something too unusual - it\u2019s pretty famous on the web. This tactic comes in 2 steps:\n\n1. Figure out where your target audience hangs out (create a list of the channels)\n2. Research the type of content your audience loves\n3. Create EPIC content based on that research (give TONS of value)\n4. Promote the HELL out of it in the channels from step 1\n\nNothing too new, right?\n\nWell, you\u2019d be surprised how many people don\u2019t use it.\n\nNow, before you start throwing stones at us for overhyping something so simple, let\u2019s dive into the case study:\n\n**How we PR\u2019d the hell out of our guide to SaaS marketing** (can't add a link, but it's on our blog and it's 14k words long), **and got 10k+ traffic as a result.**\n\nA few months back when we launched our blog, we were deciding on what our initial content should be about.\n\nSince we specialize in helping SaaS companies acquire new users, we decided to create a mega-authority guide to SaaS marketing (AND try to get it to rank for its respective keyword).\n\nWe went through the top-ranking content pieces, and saw that none of them was anything too impressive.\n\nMost of them were about general startup marketing strategies - how to validate your MVP, find a product-market fit, etc.\n\nPretty \u201cmeh,\u201d if you ask us. We believe that the #1 thing founders are looking for when Googling \u201csaas marketing\u201d are practical channels and tactics you can use to acquire new users.\n\nSo, it all started off with an idea: create a listicle of the top SaaS marketing tactics out there:\n\n1. How to create good content to drive users\n2. Promote your content\n3. Rank on Google\n4. Create viral infographics\n5. Create a micro-site\n\n...and we ended up overdoing it, covering 41+ different tactics and case studies and hitting around 14k+ words.\n\nOn one hand, oops! On the other hand, we had some pretty epic content on our hands. We even added the Smart Content Filter to make the article much easier to navigate.\n\nOnce the article was up, we ran it through some of our clients, friends, and acquaintances, and received some really good feedback.\n\nSo, now we knew it was worth promoting the hell out of it.\n\nWe came up with a huge list of all online channels that would appreciate this article:\n\n1. r/ entrepreneur and r/ startups (hi guys!). The first ended up loving the post, netting us \\~600 upboats and a platinum medal. The latter also ended up loving the post, but the mods decided to be assholes and remove it for being \u201cself-promotional.\u201d So, despite the community loving the content, it got axed by the mods. Sad. (Fun fact - this one time we tried to submit another content piece on r/ startups with no company names, no links back to our website, or anything that can be deemed promotional. One of the mods removed it for mentioning a link to Ahrefs. Go figure!)\n2. Hacker News. Tons of founders hang out on HN, so we thought they\u2019d appreciate anything SaaS-related. This netted us around \\~200+ upvotes and some awesome feedback (thanks HN!)\n3. Submit on Growth Hackers, Indie Hackers, and all other online marketing communities. We got a bunch of love on Indie Hackers, the rest were quite inactive.\n4. Reach out to all personal connects + clients and ask for a share\n5. Run Facebook/Twitter ads. This didn\u2019t particularly work out too well for us, so we dropped it after 1-2 weeks.\n6. Run a Quuu promotion. If you haven\u2019t heard of Quuu, it\u2019s a platform that matches people who want their content to be shared, with people who want their social media profiles running on 100% auto-pilot. We also got \u201cmeh\u201d results here - tons of shares, next to no likes or link clicks.\n7. Promoted in SaaS and marketing Facebook groups. This had awesome results both in terms of traffic, as well as making new friends, AND getting new leads.\n8. Promoted in entrepreneur Slack channels. This worked OK - didn\u2019t net us traffic, but got us some new friends.\n9. Emailed anyone we mentioned in the article and asked for a share. Since we mentioned too many high profile peeps and not enough non-celebs, this didn\u2019t work out too well\n10. Emailed influencers that we thought would like the article / give it a share. They didn\u2019t. We were heart-broken.\n\nAnd accordingly, created a checklist + distribution sheet with all the websites or emails of people we wanted to ping.\n\nOverall, this netted us around 12,000 page views in total, 15+ leads, 6,000 traffic in just 2 promotion days.\n\nAs for SEO results, we got a bunch of links. (I would have added screenshots to all of these results, but don't think this subreddit allows it).\n\nA lot of these are no-follow from Reddit, HackerNews, and other submission websites, but a lot of them are also pretty authentic.\n\nThe cool part about this link-building tactic is that people link to you without even asking. You create awesome content that helps people, and you get rewarded with links, shares, and traffic!\n\nAnd as for the cherry on top, only 2 months after publishing the article, it\u2019s ranking on position #28. We\u2019re expecting it to get to page 1 within the new few months and top 3 within the year.\n\n# Step #6 - Interlink Your Pages\n\nOne of Google's ranking factors is how long your visitors stick around on your website.\n\nSo, you need to encourage users reading ONE article, to read, well, the rest of them (or at least browse around your website). This is done through interlinking.\n\nThe idea is that each of your web pages should be linked to and from every other relevant page on your site.\n\nSay, an article on \"how to make a resume\" could link to (and be linked from) \"how to include contact info on a resume,\" \"how to write a cover letter,\" \"what's the difference between a CV and a resume,\" and so on.\n\nProper interlinking alone can have a significant impact on your website rankings. NinjaOutreach, for example, managed to improve their organic traffic by 40% through better interlinking alone.\n\nSo, how do you do interlinking \u201cright?\u201d\n\nFirst off, make it a requirement for your writers to link to the rest of your content. Add a clause to your writer guidelines that each article should have 10+ links to your other content pieces.\n\nMore often than not, they\u2019ll manage to get 60-70% of interlinking opportunities. To get this to 100%, we usually do bi-annual interlinking runs. Here\u2019s how that works.\n\nPick an article you want to interlink. Let\u2019s say, for example, an article on 'business process management'.\n\nThe goal here is to find as many existing articles on your blog, where \u2018business process management\u2019 is mentioned so that we can add a link to the article.\n\nFirstly, Google the keyword \u2018business process management\u2019 by doing a Google search on your domain. You can use the following query:\n\n*site:yourwebsite.com \"keyword\"*\n\nIn our case, that\u2019s:\n\nsite:example.com \u201cbusiness process management\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll get a complete list of articles that mention the keyword \u201cbusiness process management.\n\nNow, all you have to do is go through each of these, and make sure that the keyword is hyperlinked to the respective article!\n\nYou should also do this for all the synonyms of the keyword for this article. For example, \u201cBPM\u201d is an acronym for business process management, so you\u2019d want to link this article there too.\n\n# Step #7 - Track &amp; Improve Your Headline CTRs\n\nArticle CTRs play a huge role in determining what ranks or not.\n\nLet\u2019s say your article ranks #4 with a CTR of 15%. Google benchmarks this CTR with the average CTR for the position.\n\nIf the average CTR for position #4 is 12%, Google will assume that your article, with a CTR of 15% is of high quality, and will reward you with better rankings.\n\nOn the other hand, if the average CTR is 18%, Google will assume that your article isn\u2019t as valuable as other ranking content pieces, and will lower your ranking.\n\nSo, it\u2019s important to keep track of your Click Through Rates for all your articles, and when you see something that\u2019s underperforming, you can test different headlines to see if they\u2019ll improve CTR.\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably wondering, how do you figure out what\u2019s the average CTR?\n\nUnfortunately, each search result is different, and there's no one size fits all formula for average CTR.\n\nOver the past few years, Google has been implementing a bunch of different types of search results - featured snippet, QAs, and a lot of other types of search results.\n\nSo, depending on how many of these clutter and the search results for your given keyword, you\u2019ll get different average CTRs by position.\n\nRule of thumb, you can follow these values:\n\n* 1st position -&gt; \\~31.73% CTR\n* 2nd pos. -&gt; \\~24.71%\n* 3rd pos. -&gt; 18.66%\n* 4th pos. -&gt; 13.60%\n* 5th -&gt; 9.51%\n* 6th -&gt; 6.23%\n* 7th -&gt; 4.15%\n* 8th -&gt; 3.12%\n* 9th -&gt; 2.97%\n\nKeep in mind these change a lot depending on your industry, PPC competitiveness, 0-click searches, etc...\n\n**Use a scraping tool** like Screaming Frog to extract the following data from all your web pages:\n\n* Page title\n* Page URL\n* Old Headline\n\nDelete all the pages that aren\u2019t meant to rank on Google. Then, head over to Google Search Console and extract the following data for all the web pages:\n\n* CTR (28 Day Range)\n* Avg. Position\n\nAdd all of this data to a spreadsheet.\n\nNow, check what your competition is doing and use that to come up with new headline ideas. Then, put them in the *Title Ideas* cell for the respective keyword.\n\nFor each keyword, come up with 4-5 different headlines, and implement the (seemingly) best title for each article.\n\nOnce you implement the change, insert the date on the *Date Implemented* column. This will help you keep track of progress.\n\nThen, wait for around 3 - 4 weeks to see what kind of impact this change is going to have on your rankings and CTR.\n\nIf the results are not satisfactory, record the results in the respective cells, and implement another test for the following month. Make sure to update the *Date Implemented* column once again.\n\n# Step #8 - Keep Track of Rankings &amp; Make Improvements On-The-Go\n\nYou\u2019re never really \u201cdone\u201d with SEO - you should always keep track of your rankings and see if there\u2019s any room for improvement.\n\nIf you wait for an adequate time-frame after publishing a post (6 months to a year) and you\u2019re still seeing next to no results, then it might be time to investigate.\n\nHere\u2019s what this usually looks like for us:\n\n* **Audit the content**\n   * Does your content have an adequate word count? Think, 1.5-2x your competitors.\n   * Is the content well-written?\n   * Do the images in your article add value? E.g. no stock or irrelevant images.\n   * Is the content optimized for SEO? Think, keyword density, links to external websites, etc.\n* **Audit internal links**\n   * Does the content link to an adequate number of your other articles or web pages?\n   * Is the article linked to from an adequate number of your web pages or blog posts? You can check this on Search Console =&gt; Links =&gt; Internal Links. Or, if you\u2019re using Yoast or RankMath, you can check the # of internal links a post has in the WordPress Dashboard -&gt; Posts.\n* **Audit the backlinks**\n   * Do you have as many backlinks as your competitors?\n   * Are your backlinks from the countries you want to rank in? If you have a bunch of links from India, but you want to rank in the US, you\u2019d need to get more US links.\n   * Are your links high quality? More often than not, low DA / PA links are not that helpful.\n   * Did you disown low-quality or spam links?\n* **Audit web page**\n   * Does the web page load too slow? Think, 4+ seconds.\n   * Did you enable lazy loading for the images?\n   * Did you compress all images on the web page?\n\n...And that's it.\n\nHope you guys had a good read and learned a thing or two :) HMU if you have any questions.\n\nIf you want to read the full version in a more reader-friendly format, you can check out our [SEO process](https://apollodigital.io/blog/seo-process) blog post here.",

Most of the better template sites like ThemeForest allow you to demo them in your browser so you can see how the site functions. Installing the theme is fairly straightforward even if you're not a developer. Maybe search for a tutorial on theme installation if you get stuck. \n\nAnd most of the large hosting companies will come with an option to install Wordpress on the server automatically for you. Keep in mind though, Wordpress isn't necessarily \"good for SEO\" but it definitely doesn't handcuff you at all and you can rank really well with a decent theme, good content and link outreach.\n\nIf you are an ecom site I would go with Shopify.",

My first site was actually built with Wordpress with a theme from ThemeForest, but the developer abandoned the theme after a few years (I could no longer update wordpress and use the theme without something breaking).

I'm looking for something awesome for a blog + shop.  \n\n\nI was considering Wordpress + Generate Press as a way of solving the developer abandonment issue (it's basically a yearly template subscription, but arguably more powerful than a regular template).

Slightly more work up front, probably cheaper in the end and you won't handcuff yourself on SEO.",

While some of these steps are more vital than others, no one should get discouraged by the volume of it all. For instance, if you've got a page or two that uses lazy-loading for images, that's going to be o.k.\n\nPeople should know that SEO is often a marathon. You may make a bunch of these changes, but not start seeing any significant uptick for 6 or 9 months -- depending on the industry. \n\nOnce you get to the bottom of this list, start back over at the top -- or, what I'm really saying is, you need to continually re-visit and re-optimize each of these foundational elements of your site and your work. \n\nOverall though, I think this is a good general outline/guide, and the *how* of doing each of the steps mentioned is easily found/learned online.

Grab a JSON-LD app like \"JSON-LD for SEO\" clean out any junk metadata/JSON-LD from other themes/apps and you're mostly sussed.\n\nA CMS is no place for content or keyword optimization. Just learn how to do good kw research (GAds KW planner, Ahrefs, SEMrush etc etc), what kind of page layout &amp; HTML semantics contribute to good on-page SEO patterns.

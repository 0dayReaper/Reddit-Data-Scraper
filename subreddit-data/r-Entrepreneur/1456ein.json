In other words how can anyone help you with your Amazon store, what would you seek out ?  \nHere's a list of ideas, if I can have some ideas that I didn't think, would be great:  \n\\- Offer X amount on the very first order  \n\\- PPC Campaign  \n\\- Amazon Emails (reviews)  \n\\- Taking care of negative reviews.  \nThanks",

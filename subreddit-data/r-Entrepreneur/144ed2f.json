    "postText": "**Background:** My business has experienced a downturn and I expect to be earning less from the company than my monthly personal expenses by July. We are high tech and exposed to the changes in investment that happened with the regional banking crisis and the rise in interest rates. I have been operating this way for 10+ years and the earn-less-than-I-need thing has happened four times: Once when I started from a layoff (to cashflow profitable in 4 months), once when a baby was born and I chose to radically reduce travel and even work-effort for the first year, once in summer/fall 2021 for maybe four months, and now.\n\nFor the most part, when things have been slow I have \"gotten busy like a school boy making an A\", but this upcoming market seems ... tight.\n\n**The \"Opportunity\":** I was recently contacted by one of those appointment-setting firms. This one actually got me to click, which is a good sign. They want an initial contract for 4 months, during which I should have 20 \"good\" sales meetings. If I don't book 20 meetings, I get my money back. They make no guarantees on sales, but if we don't have 20 good meetings there is some sort of refund involved. The guy has consistent answers to my questions and his delivery style seems good. He also has a few \"secret sauce\" techniques to goose engagement that make sense to me technically.\n\n**Cost Comparison:** For us a typical \"modest\" sales might net us $20K, a cheap one $10K, a good one $40K.He'll charge me $500 to start and about $4K a month for a 4 month engagement to get those 20 meetings. So if I get one deal out of it, it will likely pay for itself.\n\nIf this yields no customers I still have a few years of runway in the bank, and my trickle of existing business is non-zero and I expect will continue to be as I have more free time for business development. The guy  has happy continuous customers he can introduce to me.\n\n**My question for you:** Do you have any broad general advice, and what questions should I be asking before I say \"yes\"?\n\n**PS: More Intel:** My company has two divisions. The smaller division does print ads and joined the better business bureau, these both roughly paid for themselves. BBB cost us $600 and got maybe one customer worth $1K annually in profit so far; we've had it about six months. The print ads are about the same. I earn about 5% on my cash so the opportunity loss of the cash isn't really worth calculating. ",

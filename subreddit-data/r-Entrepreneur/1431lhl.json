    "postText": "Hey guys, we are designing a startup. By now, we need to estimate the marketing costs across different channels, such as social medias instagram/facebook/google/titktok/reddit, even TV/radio, and so on... how is that usually done, getting in touch one by one, such going into what the costs would be like instagram, facebok, etc.. or what? Are there some site/automated tools where we can simulate what those costs would be like filtering like country/city, etc? \n\nlet me know if there's anything that's not clear. Thanks in advance",

You control your marketing budget through research and product-market-fit. Eleswise you'll completely coincidentally come up with the exact amount of loose change clanging away in your pocket.\n\nMarketing budgets are best seen as the friction between what you built and what the target customer really wanted. With little friction, that budget can be small; a press release say. With product-market friction, that sum rapidly spikes. That holds inconveniently true across industry types.\n\nA marketing budget is not just what you decided to pay ...you are either calculating the price of market entry, or you're just making shit up. With most market entry being an astronomical sum, paid on the installment plan.",

For other channels, it's best to reach out to them directly. Keep in mind that there are often both CPC and CPM costs, so be sure to compare the two. Good luck with your startup!",

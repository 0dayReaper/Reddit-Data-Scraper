I have no idea what will happen, none of us know what the attrition will be, but it seems like a terrible business move to burn bridges with your power-users, partners, and nascent marketplace builders. \n\nIn the B2B space, you'd love to be in a situation where you have people going out of their way to integrate experiences and data into your primary platform tool. This is exactly how Salesforce, Snowflake, Zuora, Github, etc. blew up the way they did. \n\nWhy in the world would you try to crush the free labor of other people who make your platform better? It seems shortsighted to a fault, especially for a product that relies on critical mass to grow and make money. Doubly so given that Apollo and RIF and users would probably be okay paying some amount of money for better API tooling and API access.",

I definitely encourage other developers to take note of these strategies!\n\nParticularly, monitoring the constant development of open source LLMs is exciting, as it seems that self-hosting an LLM that performs up to standards without eating into operating costs with each API request isn't very far off at all.

And also, you could build an entire business based on their API. And API is a method through which you can talk to and manipulate another companies systems. Example: reddit api, openai, Twitter, Facebook, many many more. \n\nYou could, theoretically, build an entire company by making it easier to interact with those APIs. Here isnan example: build an app that allows you to very easily post and repurposr content to MANY different social media sites (like - reddit Twitter Facebook and YouTube). But if you did that, you'd be ENTIRELY dependent on those third party APIs foe your business models, and thus - heavily affected if something changes or that business goes under or something like that. \n\nSo don't out all your eggs in one basket. Or do. But understand the risks and think long term (or dont, and good luck)",

    "postText": "We would like to keep our anonymity and form an LLC in Pennsylvania. We will use a registered agent for both the \"registered address\" and \"organizer\" section of the Certificate of Organization. I realize this document is public record.\n\nDespite extensive googling, I cannot find out whether the Docketing Statement (which requires the name and address of who will be filing taxes) is public record.\n\nIf it is public record, we will hire a tax person and use their name/address.\n\nIf only the government will see this form, we can do the taxes ourselves.\n\nAnyone have an answer? Thanks in advance.",

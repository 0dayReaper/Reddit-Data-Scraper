    "postText": "I\u2019ve owned a business for 4 years now in online coaching. It\u2019s scaled to 5-figure months and I\u2019d like to give you the top 10 things that I wish I knew sooner. \n\n1. You don\u2019t need to spend $$$ on paperwork before you begin. Starting out, you don\u2019t need an LLC, S-corp, etc unless you somehow bagged 100K in funding. I started my business with $30 out of my own pocket as a Sole Proprietor, created sales, and worked my way to getting an LLC and all the other fancies. If you need other stuff for legal reasons before you can sell, that\u2019s different and should be done. \n\n2. Don\u2019t go crazy spending time/money making your website look beautiful. Focus on ONE product. Ask your clients what part of the website/sales was appealing and what could\u2019ve been improved. Learn from them, they paid for your services. \n\n3. Your ideal clients won\u2019t flock to you, especially if you haven\u2019t built a following or brand. Don\u2019t expect to launch a website or booking system and \u201cbe found\u201d. Getting consistent clients takes ample time in social marketing (people who don\u2019t follow/subscribe to you), direct marketing (followers/email subscribers), and referrals. \n\n4. Get 3 mentors before you invest in coaching. Find 3 people that are at where you want to be in 5 years. Ask them if they\u2019re willing to be a mentor or lend a listening ear. This doesn\u2019t mean you should expect them to be your coach, but you can often go to them with very specific questions/situations. Most of my mentors make $800k-$2M a year. We meet maybe once a month (or less) but their inboxes are always open. \n\n5. If you\u2019re an online coach, get yourself a VA. Think about how you\u2019re spending your time - yes you can do all that a VA does, but that\u2019s at ~$15 an hour. Do you want to make $15 an hour or $100 an hour? So why are you wasting time on things that earn $15 an hour? Before getting a VA, get good proven concept/results on the tasks you want them to do. They aren\u2019t there to enter your business as a consultant, but to ease the load on those repetitive tasks that you\u2019ve already mastered. \n\n6. If you invest in a business/marketing/sales/whatever coach, do your due diligence. Check out their website, their policies/guarantees, client testimonials, and reach out to 1-3 previous clients of theirs. Don\u2019t get burned by fake reviews. Investing in the right coach/consultant can be very rewarding. \n\n7. Focus your efforts in this order: delivering value to present clients, delivering passive value to all clients, automating more marketing, and automatic your sales process. Let\u2019s break it down - give attention to your current clients before other hypothetical clients. Your past/current clients will get you the best referrals as those are ready to purchase with little effort from you. Are you exceeding their experience expectations? Then, where possible, automate actions. Do you regularly send out the same email at a certain point? Do you set them up with access to files or your system after purchase? Do you follow up with them after their coaching is done? This can be automated. Then add marketing sequences to your followers. Some of your followers won\u2019t purchase until years after they follow you. A value-rich email every two weeks keeps you at top of mind. Create marketing content (focus on one platform at a time). Marketing content and social engagement aren\u2019t the same. Lastly, improve your sales funnel if needed. A client likes a systematic journey once they decide to learn more about you/what you do and they usually like instant info. How can you make the \u201clearn more\u201d to \u201cthanks for scheduling your consult\u201d seamless and scalable?\n\n8. If you\u2019re just getting started, you\u2019ll hear this a lot \u201cbe where your ideal clients are\u201d. I hate that phrase, what the f does that even mean? What that actually means is where the heck would you go to complain about this topic? Reddit, LinkedIn, FB, Yelp, Upwork, whatever. Be there, add value, don\u2019t self promote. Just comment and add value. Don\u2019t sell you, your products, your clients or anything else. If people want to learn more from you, they\u2019ll find you. \n\n9. Protect your business (CYA). Set up a solid policy/guarantee on your website or contract. Record your calls, send recap emails, etc. Last thing you need is a person who tells their bank they didn\u2019t get what they paid for and you have no way to prove it or show they agreed to pay what they paid. This hasn\u2019t happened often, but when it has, CYA has helped me win every case. \n\n10. Said this above, but focus on ONE product until you hit your first MRR goal. If you want to hit $20K a month, just sell one product until you get there on a regular basis. It\u2019s easier for you and potential clients when there\u2019s only one product to choose from. I started my business thinking I can do/offer so many things so I listed them all. Biggest mistake - 80% of them hardly sell if at all. Just focus on one, prove it works, refine, refine again, get client testimonials, refine again, get that system down, and THEN add more. \n\nAdditional - best thing I did was block an entire day of the week to just focus on the business instead of in the business. And rest. Your brain is not designed to heavily work 10+ hours a day. It will cause burnout fast.",

Marketing is always changing, so many books will be out of date or not directed at your niche. \n\nWhen I hired a consultant experienced in online ads, I learned more in one hour than I ever have from a book, but it put most of what I read into the right perspective and reading gave me a good foundation.",

When I went full time into my business, it took about a year but could\u2019ve been sooner if I got out of my own head and invested in the right business coach. My coach helped me create a systematic approach to get more sales calls that didn\u2019t involve posting on social media or paying for ads.",

My dad really wants me to try becoming a coach, because he thinks I give great coaching to friends - how to comprehensively view a problem, where to find answers, etc.  \n\n\nAnd my friends agree with him that I give great advice.  \n\n\n\nHOWEVER, I have a big question:\n\n\n- how did you pick your niche? I give coaching on a range of issues, family dynamics, kids education, etc.  and everything is a one-off. There is no pattern.\n\n\nThanks so much!",

The \u201cbring you joy\u201d is the main focus. I\u2019m sure you can solve a lot of things, but the joy part will keep you disciplined and steady in your \u201cwhy\u201d. \n\nI am specifically in career coaching. I\u2019ve worked in several aspects from recruiting, to university counseling, to consulting. My issue when I started was similar - I could solve so many problems. It wasn\u2019t until I honed in on \u201cbut what do I actually enjoy helping others get results in\u201d is when the services defined themselves.",

    "postText": "The name of the mindset is, **The Circle Mindset.**\n\nDuring my time working on a Jetsetter-like discounted hotel reservation platform in Turkey, we initially focused on promoting small boutique honeymoon hotels in the Aegean Sea region to increase awareness and visibility.  \nSubsequently, we expanded our reach by signing contracts with similar hotels in bustling cities such as Istanbul, Antalya, and Cappadocia.  \nEventually, our efforts encompassed all small boutique honeymoon hotels across Turkey.  \nWithin the article, I discuss how this approach can be particularly beneficial for every company, especially during its early stages in terms of product messaging, marketing and sales.  \nI'm eager to hear your thoughts and comments on this perspective.  \nhttps://leoaskan.com/circle-mindset/",

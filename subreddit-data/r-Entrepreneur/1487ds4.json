As our business progressed, people from two completely other industries came to us, and asked us if we could solve or assist with certain pain points in their industries.  We found that we could.  So we were chasing work from 3 very different industries from almost scratch... In one we partnered with a company who knew all the buyers.   Did a lot of demos.  In the other, we basically started from scratch with each project, explaining our advantages and limitations.",

Some people enjoy having a big workforce, some don't.  Some people are happy with liabilities, others not. All these people will probably build a business differently - and that's OK.\n\nIt's your business. Cut it the way you want it to be.  There is no 'right or wrong answer'. \n\nYou need to be in touch with your own preferences and capabilities. The rest will follow.",

Do they benefit more with a freemium product, tiered product, or per-seat subscription? Freemium has better conversions, but harder to make money than paying only, high ticket, high quality products. Aside that, there\u2019s one thing I can tell you with confidence, making money with ads is the hard.",

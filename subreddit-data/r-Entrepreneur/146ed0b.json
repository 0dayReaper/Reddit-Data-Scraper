    "postText": "Soorarai Pottru | Prime Video | Telugu film (but available in English and English subtitles) | Based on True story \n\nSo my friends, I was looking for a movie to watch, and on instagram I saw a post of this movie and caption was \u201cBest movie for people who was to start a business\u201d I got curious so I went and watched it. What appealed to me was the story and reality of entrepreneurs and starting the business, the raw struggles, just when you think you made it, BOOM problem, but the film teaches how to stand up to a problem. A good 5/5\n\nSynopsis: A man from a village dreams of creating a lowcost airline that can be aspirational for even the less privileged. But with his inspiration, a leader in the aviation industry, tries his best to ensure that this dream doesn't take off.",

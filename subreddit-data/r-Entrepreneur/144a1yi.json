    "postText": "I was the first software developer hired by a couple of non-technical founders in a specific industry, let's say hotels.  Over the past two years, we've built out a platform that's working great for their clients, but could be adapted for other industries.  I've brought up the idea to the founders about expanding but they're not interested in the short term.  \n\nWhat are the implications of me going off on my own and adapting the product and market to say car dealerships.  I've reviewed my contract and it says 'can't work for hotel for one year after leaving'.  Obviously, I don't want to get fired, but think it's opportunity that they're not interested in. Thanks for the feedback",

But it is VERY interconnected, practically incestuous. I would not \"do the dirty\" on anyone in this city.\n\nSome industry's are like this. Everyone working in that industry knows everyone else and again if someone \"does the wrong thing\" no one will work with them.\n\nBut have you considered an alternative? You go to them and make them an offer. You will build this product in your own time. If you earn more than x dollars from it, you will pay them y percentage of the income for 5 years. So instead of doing something that you obviously know is not quite right, you do it in a way that they would have to be idiots to decline.",

Maybe they would be willing to explore the idea more in the long-term if it's that promising. Or perhaps you could speak with a legal professional about your options with the contract before making any moves. All the best!",

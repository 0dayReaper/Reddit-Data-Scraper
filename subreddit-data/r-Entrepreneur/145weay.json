    "postText": "I've got a good future in engineering, currently working towards my chartered status, not too far off graduating with my Master's in Engineering. \n\nI plan to follow the stable career trail, where in 5 years I'll be on \u00a340k which is alright. But I want to develop a business on the side.\n\nCurrently have 20k saved from freelance work and other endeavours which I plan to invest.\n\nI have 4 years experience using all industry standard tools, so can design and produce drawings for just about anything, but I really don't know how to best use my skill set to make good money outside of working a corporate job.\n\nI have some good ideas for products, currently looking at getting tooling made for a product that may not even sell. \n\nDoes anyone have similar experience or can point me in the right direction?",

Preferably something that you also have an interest in. Start there.",

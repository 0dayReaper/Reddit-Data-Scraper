    "postText": "My 10 yr old daughter is asking to start a pet sitting business for our small town. I don\u2019t want to block her creativeness because I\u2019m a shift worker with a bunch of health issues. Plus I\u2019ve been preaching investing and be your own boss for years. I guess what I\u2019m looking for is advertising and any other advice we can do for her?",

Tbh, I don\u2019t know that someone who is willing to pay for a pet sitter would trust a 10yo but that\u2019s for you guys to work around. Are you looking to have them at your house or would she be going to them?",

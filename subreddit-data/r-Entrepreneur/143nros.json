Also now that you work on your own, there is that comfort and feeling of satisfaction that can creep in when you are doing well then you relax and not work as hard anymore. Don\u2019t get too comfortable except you have obviously reach the level you set out for yourself.",

Not a boss or manager, but you really have to be your own manager. Be 2x hard on yourself as if your the manager of your OWN work. After the end of the day of your \"hard work\", reflect for a few minutes and look at things in third person. Did I go as hard as I could have for this person to make me successful towards my goal, or can I go harder on him next time?",

BUT, it's a wonderful journey, and gives you the freedom to make decisions for yourself, and also to handle the consequences. \r  \n\r  \nThe transition process will be full of adrenaline - so be prepared for a lot of changes.",

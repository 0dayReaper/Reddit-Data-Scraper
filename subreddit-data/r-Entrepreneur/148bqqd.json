    "postText": "My \u201cbusiness\u201d is mostly freelance programming. On the side I offer web hosting and IT which I want to focus on. I basically eliminate the need for my clients to have an IT company. I have about 16 clients who pay monthly for my services but growth is slow and I don\u2019t work in it very much.\n\nThe agency I worked for about 10 years ago charged $400/mo for a service I offer better quality of for $60/mo. I lack the confidence to ask for more.\n\nI am not sure how to market my services. I have never advertised and I don\u2019t have a good strategy or package rates.\n\nI currently have my name attached to everything and I\u2019m worried that I will look greedy if I charge the same as an agency that offers the same service. Maybe I should create a brand? How do I get over the feeling that it\u2019s a dishonest facade, even when the service is legit? Do solo entrepreneurs use a brand name?\n\nWhat about legal documents and agreements? How do I know when the client needs to sign something and what sort of legal person can help with that?\n\nI also do not know how to hire employees or how payroll or taxes work in that regard. I do not know if it is wise to hire someone to do marketing or to give business advice, but that may be a good idea. Does an accountant help with that, or is there a service that does the complex part for me?\n\nI am currently registered as a solo LLC but had been suggested to make an S corp (or c corp, I don\u2019t know the difference). Who can give me real advice that fits what I do? So many google searches expect me to have employees or expenses but I\u2019m running pretty lean. Maybe $300/mo in expenses.\n\nQuarterly taxes are tough. I bought a house last year and screwed myself by withdrawing the down payment from my retirement account and getting taxed + penalized on top of draining $60k for that down payment, but have since recovered.\n\nI\u2019m pretty burnt out on the programming aspect of my business so it would be wise to start shifting to the service end instead of the 100+ hour projects.\n\nI don\u2019t have anyone I can ask for advice. I grew up poor and my friends are either unemployed or working for ex. safeway, fedex, and applebees. My parents dropped it of middle school and are struggling. My sisters are unemployed single moms on food stamps with government provided housing. So I can\u2019t stress how much running a business is alien to me, I feel like an impostor.\n\nI am looking for any kind of advice. Maybe there is a book I should read or an online course I should take? Should I go as far as taking college classes?\n\nOr is it time to give up and get a regular job? Problem is I expect half the pay. But it\u2019s really nice being able to clock out at the end of the day\u2026\n\nThanks,\n\nR",

            "comment": "$60/mo? My brother in Christ. Please don't do this. You're burning yourself out. Even if your expenses are only $300/mo. What's happening is that even if you work freelance you need to be working around the clock still. You said your family is poor so that definitely means that you are supporting more than yourself so in actuality your expenses are way more than $300.   \n\n\nI have to assume now so Let's say you live in a developing area so you can cut prices. But what's the quality of your work? When we talk programming: geolocation, education, and what have you don't matter so much as ability does. If you can do agency-caliber work. You should be asking for around 20-30% below the agency package, just because you don't have the same overhead (It's just good business to be competitive with pricing. but still make a substantial profit)  \n\n\nI know money is a dicey subject to speak with clients about but in this case, it is needed. What you need to do is up your prices and give all your clients notice that your situation has changed and pon this date (In about a month) you'll have to raise your prices. If they believe your services are topnotch and they respect the relationship they've built with you they'll accept. (Some will Negotiate which is good just land on something significantly more than what you're charging right now). This will allow you to make the same if not more money and free yourself up to focus on establishing your brand and chasing leads which is something you should be doing constantly. You should be posting every day on social media. You should also be learning every day just to get better at programming.   \n\n\nYou're just like how I used to be and I want to let you know that you are at the edge of a cliff and you need to jump. It's a huge risk but you need to bet on yourself to make it. All you can do is bet on yourself. To understand your Business administration needs I need to know more about your area. I have an LLC as well but I'm in the UK it might be different. Taxes are a pain and you should go to an accountant for that I'm lucky enough that my sister is one. DM, me. I'd love to help where I can.",

Take what you need to leave the rest on the table. Running businesses have always been in my family so even though i have a degree in marketing. I know everything about setting up a business from my family. My uncle used to have a lodge and I got my first job running the main house as a property manager so I don't think you need to hire anyone just yet. You might not get it right. Start on youtube. find out the admin stuff. learn to do it yourself. setup a sales funnel. Do more Marketing more Networking and Keep going 'til the wheels fall of the school bus",

I grew up in poverty too, and am the first person in my family to graduate college with a bachelor's (much less a Master's). Having money, having property, is weird to me. I still operate like a starving packrat even though I've had financial security for some time. That feeling never really goes away, so get used to shoving it under the bed.\n\n\n\"Who can help me with payroll/taxes/business structure\".\n\n\nAccountant. Every business owner needs one, and it's a big step towards becoming professional. You may not even need all of their services, but they'll save you a lot of trouble. I've been in SMB accounting for some time now, drop me a line if you have any burning questions and I'll be happy to point you in the right direction until you get your own.\n\n\nBiggest thing I took away from your post was that you need to charge more. Of course you're going to burn out when you're not charging what you're worth.\n\n\nYour focus is on IT: okay, time to sell MITS packages. Create some tiers, work on your sales pitch, determine what your preferred clients are and then target those businesses specifically.\n\n\nIt's hard to raise prices on existing clients without them dipping but new ones should be getting charged your new premium price until you can retire the old ones.\n\n\nI'm happy to soundboard for you if you'd like. My brother is a MITS and Programming solopreneur and I've been down this road before!",

That\u2019s essentially what I do.\n\nRaising the price for new clients will be my next goal. Others suggest raising old clients as well but that will be easier once I make a few sales at the new rate.\n\nI appreciate the tips!",

Be as clear and honest about WHY you\u2019re doing it (better service + market adjustment so you can stay competitive, like all businesses do) and then consider offering your existing customers some kind of deal like locking in the same rate for 3 more months if they pay ahead, or a year at 80% off (paid monthly, on contract), etc. And then welcome any/all feedback via email/text/direct call. Edit here: The point of this is so it\u2019s \u201cchose an option that works for you\u201d and not \u201cyes/no, take it or leave it\u201d.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t be like Reddit and shove this change on them rapidly! Give them at least 90 days to think it over.\n\nYou got this!",

If you create three packages from a price psychology perspective ( I can give you more details over DM), people will most likely choose the middle one.

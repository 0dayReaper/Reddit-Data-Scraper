    "postText": "A family member is opening a local shop where we live in a small European city. She doesn\u2019t have a formal education and is pretty tech-illiterate. Since the market here in the location she is unpredictable and seasonal, I have advised her to have an eshop as well. \n\nI\u2019m going to be creating an e-commerce website for her, (using Shopify), and probably running it as well. What is a fair percentage of sales to receive for this? \n\n(I should add I\u2019m a graphic designer and I\u2019ll be creating the entire brand free of charge to help out because she is family)\n\nThanks in advance,",

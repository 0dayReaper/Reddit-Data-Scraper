            "comment": "I always hated a day job. I hated having to wake up and be somewhere for someone else never being able to be apart of the company or give ideas or anything along those lines. So I\u2019d save my money and quit every summer for a few months trying to figure out a way. I did this for a few years. Then a few years ago I found a job through a mutual friend who started a construction company. I worked for him for a year and then the company went under,  it I learned what not to do and what to do. Then I decided man I think this guy can make it and we had become friends so we decided to go into business and use both our skills to create a business in the construction field. Two years later and we been making 2 grand a piece every week. Getting guys hired. Trying to buy some trucks. Really trying to build a business. Still have to be places and get up, but it\u2019s the freedom. I can say man I\u2019m done today and go home. I can make choices of how I want to do things and my partner and I what I don\u2019t know he knows and what he doesn\u2019t know I know and we figure it out. It\u2019s not like working anymore. It doesn\u2019t feel like man fuck this job anymore.",

I along with everyone else I\u2019m sure, hate waking up to an alarm not really set by you, reporting to a boss, watching people you look down on getting promoted, and feeling like you do too much for too little. \n\nI\u2019m young, I have a shitty Amazon FBA business and a full time job. Ever since my first full time job at 15 I\u2019ve wanted to work for myself. It\u2019s a stuggle, I tried to figure something out very intently for 4 years while studying in college. I learned a lot during that time, but nothing worked. Idk where I\u2019m going or how I\u2019m gonna get there.\n\nI like to think of myself as a heat seeking missile. I don\u2019t know exactly where the target is, but I know where it isn\u2019t. (ex. Drugs, Netflix, Parties, Poor Diet) I think if I subtract where it isn\u2019t and replace it with where I think it is, (ex. Education, Risk Management, Health, Focus) I just might find it.",

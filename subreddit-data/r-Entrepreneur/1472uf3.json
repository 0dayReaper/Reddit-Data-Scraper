    "postText": "I'm planning to start a business that sells wholesale, retail, used, new, services, travels and more. All from b2b, b2c, b2g and so on. Mostly on the internet or other ways which won't require me to have a physical store.\n\nSome examples:\n\nMy first target is the hotel I work at. I want to advertise/rent their rooms and business rooms in foreign countries (preferably b2b). The hotel is connected to an entertainment park. How do I break this to my boss and how do I sell this? \n\nMy second target is to sell camping equipment from foreign manufacturers to retail chains. How do I do this? \n\nThirdly I want to find repair jobs and outsource them to construction or repair companies. I dont want to have my own employees to start with. How do I advertise and sell this?",

I'm not sure how this works. The other issue is how much the hotel director would pay me for doing it as an entrepreneur.",

            "comment": "Where do you live? Is it urban, rural, suburb? Is it growing, shrinking, or stagnant? What are the primary industries? Consider checking out some local business networking events or asking friends/relatives in the area what needs they see in their respective industries. For example, a growing sprawling suburb like my hometown needs a lot of landscapers, builders, pool cleaners, and handyman services. Places with a lot of commercial real estate need a lot of security guards, power washers, or tradesmen specialized in installing and servicing commercial kitchens. IT support within some niche is always in-demand it seems. Lots of people have moved to solar - that all will require service and maintenance. Same with people who can work within niches for stuff like electric vehicles or their charging stations. I'd take a good long while to thoroughly vet that your potential field is in fact in-demand and do some research on what your potential market size is and do the math on what you'd realistically need to be viable. \n\nYou want to fit your business to unmet problem or underserved demand (or less common, by creating a demand). Maybe even start with your own industry your currently work in. If you have your own existing business, maybe you can branch out by offering additional related services that you can upsell to your existing clients. \n\nHarvard inovation labs has free lectures on YouTube that are mainly attended by brilliant people doing novel things like providing medical care to people in the privatized space industry. However, the principles and lectures are all just as pertinent for someone starting a window washing business as it is for someone trying to take on Google in the app space. Also check out some free resources like a business canvass (free just Google it) to help you evaluate ideas. It's far far far far better to find out an idea isn't viable before starting than after you've sunk money and time into it.",

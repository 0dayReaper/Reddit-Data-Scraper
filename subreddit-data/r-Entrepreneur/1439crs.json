    "postText": "Hi, I get tons of ideas daily but due to my laziness of not writing them down quickly I tend to forget them a lot of time. \n\nTo solve this I decided to build something myself and it is really helping me.  Whenever I get an Idea, I just speak that in the mic and it records and summarises for me. Speaking is way easier than writing so it is saving me alot of time.  \n\n\nI am putting it out for everyone to use now. Let me know if anyone wants to try it out",

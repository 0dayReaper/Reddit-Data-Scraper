I did my job and did it very well but I spent most of my time thinking of ways to improve the business that I worked at, understand the supply chain completely, the roles in the company, and all of those things for our top two or three competitors.\n\nThis opened up so many areas that I was allowed to dive deep into and develop specialized skill sets that set me apart today with my own company. It also made the companies I worked for huge increases in profitability or helped scale down their costs dramatically. I always looked at a job as a place to earn enough to pay your bills but really it's a place to learn. I also started in every company as full commission sales role and by increasing our profits or decreasing our cost I was indirectly increasing my commissions though my percentage always stayed the same. During the process over the years you'll also build a massive network of influence in your industry or any other industry you work in by doing this. It is something that you do for months and years at a time It has to be a constant. \n\nIf an employer has employees that means the business has grown to the point where it can sustain employees. There are a million valuable lessons to be learned in any business that has reached that level.\n\nYour average person doesn't want to invest into themselves that thoroughly though. Work harder on yourself than you do on your job so to speak. Most people say well I work a lot when I get home I have family and I eat a little dinner and then I sit back and watch a little TV and then I have to sleep and do it all over again. That person's not going to get to 1% and they'll bitch about it forever.",

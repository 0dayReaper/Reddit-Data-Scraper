If you wanna sell on amazon, I recommend Flips4Miles on Youtube, and watch one of his most popular videos. He explains a category of selling on Amazon called online arbitrage, good luck",

And learn from your mistakes.\n\nYou can sell digital products, re-sell, create your own clothing line, wholesale, dropship, re-market other products. But until you know the system, and how to break through, you won't have success.\n\nIt requires a tonne of research, application, learning, and expertise - something that can't be fluked. Just like starting a company or a newsletter like [The Champions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe), nothign comes from pot luck. Work hard, do the reserarch, make the errors, and figure out the winning way. It won't happen instantly, but it can be a big successs.",

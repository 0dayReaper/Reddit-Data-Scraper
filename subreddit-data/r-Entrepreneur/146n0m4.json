Maybe the people calling themselves 'entrepreneurs' really mean something very different indeed.\n\nDo not posts like this signal the OP is, in fact, a consumer of a product they refer to as entrepreneurship? They just want to know which product to buy, much like a toaster, or a lawn mower.\n\nIn the now entrepreneurship is nothing more than a brand you'd wear, like a fashion label. The concept is a simple one to understand: You are what you economically 'consume.' You are an entrepreneur because you pronounce the word correctly, that is the sole challenge to it.\n\nYou want this brand or that one, you purchase it and, well ... you join that consumption pool and you are in that brand club and identify with whatever the brand supposedly stands for. ...Sad. Pathetic perhaps. Still qualifies as social in an off-kilter social science way.\n\nOddly enough, it is a poverty-stricken consumer group as most of these starter-outers have pocket change to fund their project. Dollar store brand positioning if you ask me.",

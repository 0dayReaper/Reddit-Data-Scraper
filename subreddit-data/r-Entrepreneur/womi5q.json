    "postText": "I built [Cakeslip](https://cakeslip.com) for my senior class project (yes, my professor was cool as hell) as \"TikTok for porn.\"\n\nIn the near term, my goal is to make Cakeslip the fastest and most reliable way to browse NSFW Reddit videos across all interests and kinks. To be honest, I think the site is already the best (I'm more humble than I seem, I promise! Check it out for yourself if you don't believe me).\n\nLonger-term, I want to solve the top painpoint for adult creators - discovery. OnlyFans has completely changed the porn industry. The next phase of the industry is continuing what OF did and extending it to **discoverability*****,*** which TikTok has revolutionized. Hence, why Cakeslip is \"TikTok for porn.\" \n\nI'm thinking of going all-in on the site. I absolutely love building it and working with sex creators.\n\nBUT growth is hard to come by. Hard to promote an NSFW site with no ad budget.\n\nRetention is fairly strong for a website with no push notifications (20% 30d retention) so people continue to use the site once they discover it.\n\nBut how to grow it???\n\nAny *tips* would be appreciated :)",

On reddit people post clips and compilations from porn networks which have their content copyrighted and unlawful distribution is punishable and often persecuted. Illegal porn sites have no problems since they operate on torrents but going fully legal with porn from reddit is impossible so to speak.\n\nEdit: if you really wanna do this legally it's gonna cost you- a lot. If you wanna do adult content website you simply can't outsource your content for free. \n\nThere are two options i see:\npartner up with only fans models and/or porn agencies. Your content will be professional and copyrighted but it's gonna cost you so this is more of a premium product\n\nMake creators account option so people can consent they are 18 blah blah blah and they can upload home made videos so it's totally amateur. Later down the road porn agencies will join in for the advertisement. This option requires a damn good lawyer that will charge you 10s of thousands so get yourself funded",

            "comment": "Biggest trouble point will be somehow ensuring that the original creators of the content have the copyright to use it and post it on there and then give you the rights to use it. Not sure what's stopping people from just, posting copyrighted content from other porn organizations -- then slapping it on there as if they created it themselves. This can open you up to huge lawsuits. I don't even know how the fuck other enormous websites like YouTube deal with this themselves -- I think a large part of it comes from their Content ID matching system that has a huge bank of video content that it cross-references your uploaded content against to ensure you're not violating any copyrights when you post a video. The logistics of implementing something like that is, needless to say, fucking immense.\n\nNot sure where the content is coming from -- I've read some in the comment thread saying it's just aggregated from other websites that aggregate porn that THEY don't have the copyright to use. If that's true, you're just asking to get sued. You can't just, take other people's copyrighted work like this and create a product that re-packages it and sells it. Even if you can create a really fantastic end-product by doing so, you're just not legally allowed to do this. It's all fun-and-games until you get hit with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.\n\n(Funny enough I actually had to abandon a recent business startup I was working on that was a banger of a good idea, the end-product was insanely fucking helpful -- but at the end of the day, I just didn't have clear-enough copyright ownership of some of the key pieces, and this could've opened me up to lawsuit after lawsuit. Currently working on trying to pivot the original idea in a few creative ways that generate the same value but don't come with the same legal implications.)\n\nThen there are additional considerations of people possibly posting awful content on the platform -- How will you ensure the creators are of legal age? That no violent content is being posted? Etc? That might require a vetting process of some kind -- and again, you could potentially be opening yourself to ANOTHER round of lawsuits.\n\nIf you are going to do this, and not get sued, you would almost certainly have to be \"official\" and above-board about it. Not just, grabbing and slicing up whatever videos you find online. But having users post their own unique original content, and/or agreeing to license the content to you to use on your website as a prerequisite to posting it on there. AND somehow validating that this is, indeed, their original content that they own the copyright to. THAT is what will make a venture like this so difficult to scale -- not just designing a TikTok clone application that uses porn instead of PG13 video -- but doing so in a way where you're not breaking any laws in the process.\n\nFinal point -- I'm not a lawyer, and all of that is just my common sense estimation of some of the legal hurdles you might face in trying to bring this idea to life. To really understand the river of shit you're potentially wading into, make sure to consult a REAL lawyer who's well-versed in this particular area.",

The best way I know for any social media to grow is making it VERY VERY easy to share.\n\nIt should be incredibly easy to post it on Twitter, Reddit, Onlyfans, or whatever other platform people are willing to post porn content.\n\nIf you have really solid user engagement, people will spread it by word of mouth.\n\nThe only other thing, is you need to get creators themselves to use it, you need an incentive, whether additional reach, financial benefit, etc.\n\nThe community needs to be able to share super easy, and you need a good enough value proposition for creators to join and post content through your platform. If the community reaches critical mass, you don't really need much of a value proposition, like TikTok. With their mass amount of advertisement initially and the virality of everything, the user base reached that point very quickly and from that point, creators joined purely because of the potential reach and audience.",

When the user clicks the link the profile pops up instead of sending you to Reddit because of the hassle of going to another site.

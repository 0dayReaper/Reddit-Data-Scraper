Recently people are questioning the content purpose for the R/Entrepreneur sub. Should members be able to solicit and freelance their skills for other users in hopes to build their portfolio opportunities? \n\n\n\n\nI met the most helpful mentor of my business career thus far in a post offering free website design. There is a need and most importantly a desire for small business owners looking to make connections. The point of business is to fill needs and solve problems. So i have created R/LimitedTimeFreeHelp for people looking and offering professional freelance services. I hope everyone brings their offers and searches to this sub and prosper. \n\n\n\nI have already made the first post to help it answer the most important question! ",

Especially in online business related adventures that we are all interested in on /r/entrepreneur\n\nHowever, i agree that discussion on /r/entrepreneur should not be floated around \"come here to get x for free\" but rather discuss concepts or struggles or ways around problems you have encountered as an entrepreneur. Some of us might be just starting, some people might be more experienced. But for certain we can all learn from each other.\n\nAlso, a logo is just the beginning, almost anyone can create a logo that looks ok, or if you cant you can pay someone to do it for you. What you cant do, is start a successful business with just a logo, and turn your hobby or side project into making yourself a living.",

I have first hand experience with redesigning a site, where everyone was agreeing that the new design is clearly better, more modern, professional and responsive, etc., but when I view statistics, I can see apparent drop in page views and increase in bounce rate right the day it launched, and it never fully recovered.\n\nWhile design and layout is important, it's not as simple as better looking = better performing.",

People only used the logo to find them on the shelf.\n\n2007, as their target audience who experienced viewing old spice as my dad's deodorant to viewing it as my generation, I can say the new logo wasn't as important as simply not being the old logo. They could have changed it to anything. The argument of a logo having value needs to prove that a $5000 logo out performs a $50 logo. I don't believe it does. The branding as a whole is more about the total feel of the user's experience. The logo is pretty much riding the wave created by marketing, advertising, finding the audience and learning what appeals to them, etc. Nike's swoosh has value because it's tied to Nike. If they had a wing or three swooshes or three dashes to start with, that would be the logo people admire.",

Those accounts can have preloaded comments waiting on standby, either typed out manually, or using a chatbot automated type script to create comments based on keyword criteria. Once you post your reddit submission you enter the URL into the script and it will automatically upvote and comment on that submission, switching through the accounts and posting through unique IP addresses that have been preloaded.

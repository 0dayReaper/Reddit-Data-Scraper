    "postText": "Hey! 23 year old male here, II own a creative based company that offers photo/video/social media content to businesses.\n\nI got married in October and my house is really starting to fill up with video equipment...\n\nI found an office nearby that is around \u00a3385 per month.\n\nThis will allow me to have all of my gear safely stored here and I can easily charge my gear here too instead of it being here there and everywhere at home.\n\nI don't have any inhouse staff, but I do record YouTube videos/Instagram videos for my person brand, so having a space I can have a few lights always setup will be pretty cool I think?\n\nBusiness has been pretty good, of course we have our up months and our down months. However I do part time work for a property company which brings in an extra 1.5k per month which I'd use as a safety net if a set month was a bit quiet (living at home with not many expenses)\n\nWould this be the right move?\n\nThe place is around 12 mins from my house, I'd go there before and after shoots to pick up my gear or put it onto charge!\n\nEdit / This place is no contract cancel any time which is pretty cool",

The ability to keep business costs incredibly low, while letting capital stockpile, will not only give you the longevity a business needs to make it through \"trying times\" that are inevitable with any business life but also prepare you for new adventures like buying an office space when its absolutely necessary. Rent a storage unit if you have items that aren't commonly used but are still needed and important.  \n\n\nIf you decide to get a spot, however, would love to see it! Inspiring progress with your business! Congrats on the milestone, regardless of what you do! :D",

It's hard for me to have it all in one place so I have some things downstairs, some things upstairs. Things go missing and stress me out so would love to have the space to just have everything organised.\n\nIt seems like an office may be the only way to achieve this, but trying to make sure it makes sense",

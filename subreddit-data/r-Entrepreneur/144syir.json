    "postText": "Hi all, so basically I've been doing high-end landscape construction, and maintainence for 9 years now learning how to do stone masonry, japanese style pruning, water features, design concepts, fencing/carpentry, etc...\nBasically I became super skilled, and spent the past 4 years as a project manager for probably the top most quality landscape installation company in my area. I don't say this to boast, just to emphasize my difficulty in valuing my work in the future.\nCurrently I'm making $30/hr which I know is much below my marketable value, especially taking into account that I am tied to the schedule of the company, which fluctuates in activity. I've kept around the past two years managing as a debt of gratitude to my boss who is slowing down and is planning to retire sometime.\n\nMy conclusion that I've come to is that I feel like as someone highly skilled in my trade, and with good people skills, I should be able to own a house, and somewhat comfortably support a family of 4 in the city which I live in, which I believe requires a minimum of $78,000/yr. I also imagine that in the high end market, I will be finding myself having a couple of months per years worth of time off, and then working 30/35 hrs a week for 10 months worth of time.\nSo minimum for my personal hrs I'd need to charge $65/hr. Part of me feels like it's too small as it won't follow the impending inflations, and I feel like it's about what is averagely charged by others right now that are not as skilled in design, or installation as I am. Like how much more should I charge for the service because I am more skilled, and artistic than others? Should I charge any more for that? Is it a monetary value, or just an attraction value?",

            "comment": "Sounds like you should benchmark yourself against some landscape architects in your area. Since you aren\u2019t licensed you will should check out the hourly rates of the entry level staff. That\u2019s basically your competitor anyway. Depending on your area and your skill level, you could do $95. Also, you should work more on % of construction cost with hourly as additional services. \n\n- Source: landscape architect \n\nDM me if you want to chat or want me to look at anything.",

If you have to price the job based on what competitors are charging for similar jobs, factor in a premium or discount based on how you think your work is perceived or you want to be perceived relative to the competition. If you believe that what you offer is a Grade A service, your hourly might come out to $200/hr even. Hourly doesn\u2019t matter. What is the value that you are bringing? Quantify that.",

Do you live in an area where enough people live who can afford your premium services? You could be the Michael Jordan of landscape design, but if the average budget in your area is $10k, then you can\u2019t really do much? Can people in your area afford $50k, $100k landscaping projects? Do you have a reputation, 100s of 5 star reviews, testimonials? Do people know how good you are? What differentiates you from the competition? You want to eventually get to a point where you can afford to pay people who work for you $30/hr, or even more, and you\u2019re not thinking of yourself as hourly, but what is my profit on this job.",

If people come from countries where $5/hr is the norm for landscapers, why wouldn\u2019t they be jumping for joy at $20/hr? Furthermore, immigrants usually come from cultures where blue collar trades are passed down and give a run for your money if your culture lost its touch to blue collar labor. \n\nYou also factor in ability to pay. I don\u2019t care if you built an elaborate palace of marble, if you\u2019re in impoverished Memphis Tennessee, good luck finding people who can afford that with a $20,000 GDP per capita. If you\u2019re offering services in Washington DC, that\u2019s different, maybe you can cater to $120,000 GDP per capita.\n\nIf you\u2019re really as skilled as you say you are, 10 years of work experience and you\u2019re a pro at hardscaping, any town America should pay you $80/hour for your work. You don\u2019t charge by the hour, you charge by the job. What you do is hourly rate ($80/hr) x 10 hours x 1.5 fudge factor.",

If youve got 10 months, thats 1300-1500 hrs (43.33 weeks x 30-35 hrs/week). \n\nLets say youve got 3 workers - you need to book ~4200 hrs for them. As the company owner you wont always be outputting billable hrs (you gotta see clients, do basic business keeping, etc). Say you can only bill  25 hrs/wk for yourself. Thats 1084 hrs, a total of 5284 hrs. \n\nRunning a company costs money. Say you got 2-3 trucks, a mini skid steer, a mini excavator, couple of trailers, not to mention all the small tools. You will also need factor the cost of insurance, maintenance, a yard, a website and advertising, an accountant that may do your bookkeeping and taxes once a while, etc. You also have to factor in the cost of your labor of running the business (about 316 hrs/season). You may also incur an interest expense on the things you buy for your business. \n\nIdk what kind of equipment you buy and how long youll keep it for because that affects the cost of overhead, but say the cost of running your company will be $80k. Youll need to bill $15/hr (80k/5284hrs) to cover your business costs. \n\nSay you pay your guys $30/hr and the burden of labor is another $5-10 on top of that. Add overhead, add 30-50% markup on every billable hour and you get $68-82/hr. \n\nUnder this setup if you charge $70/hr for every billable hour, your personal income from the business will be about $50k, plus an additional 79k of profit from the markups. You may choose to reinvest that into the business or pay yourself a dividend. \n\nThis is also assuming that things will always go smoothly, which they will not. Weather and unexpected bumps will always hinder efficiency and cause delays, so always add a padding to your quotes and bill more hours than you need to. \n\nAnyway, map out all the variables and their costs, and see what theyll cost across all billable hours.",

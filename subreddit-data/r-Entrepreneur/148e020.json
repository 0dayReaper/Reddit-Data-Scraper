    "postText": "Nathan Barry always wanted to be a creator. He loved making stuff and earn money from the stuff he made.  \nBack in 2011, fresh out of college with a degree in graphic design, Nathan started blogging and doing freelance web design. He began selling iPhone apps, which led to making a book about designing iOS applications, to position himself as an expert. To complete his book, Nathan created an iPhone app that tracked his progress writing 1000 words a day.\n\n\"*I only had an email list of 800 people or so at the time, but there were some bloggers who had published eBooks and publicly shared their revenue numbers, and that made me realize, \u2018oh, you can make some money publishing an eBook, even to a small audience.\u2019 So I decided to write a book on how to design iPhone applications.\"*\n\nThe book was a hit - He wanted to make $10,000 over the lifetime of the book and ended up making $12,000 in the first day, and $19,000 in the first week. Riding high on this success, he continued his daily writing streak and published another book, earning $50,000 dollars in the first month.\n\n  \nWhat surprised him most was the platform that generated most leads for his books - email. He thought most leads would come from social media, like Twitter and Instagram, but they were barely comparable to the amount that came from email.\n\n  \nHe discovered that email was amazing for connecting with your audience. He loved email as a platform and how personal it was. He was using MailChimp but found it really limiting, so he used his skills as a web designer to build custom solutions.\n\n  \nHe decided to build his own email solution that was built for creators, writers and bloggers.  \nTo start, he launched the Web App Challenge, with the goal of growing a software company to $5,000 a month in recurring revenue in 6 months. And he was only going to do it with $5,000 of his own money, everything else had to come from customers. So, in January 1st, 2013, ConvertKit was born.\n\n  \nAfter six months, he didn\u2019t reach the $5,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR), he was at almost $2,000 MRR. But he wasn\u2019t exclusively dedicated to ConvertKit, he was still writing and launched another book.  \nAs a result, ConvertKit hit a plateau. The revenue stalled and churn rate skyrocketed, making the revenue shrink to almost half.  \n\n\nIn May 2014, Nathan decided to take a step back and reassess his goals. With his three books selling like hotcakes, a new baby in tow and a house remodeling, he decided to take a break from ConvertKit. However, he started having health problems and a mental toll pushed him to seek counseling.  \nEventually he got back into writing books and ConvertKit. ConvertKit was still losing money every day. \n\nThen, out of the blue, while attending a conference, Nathan received some blunt advice from his friend Hiten Shah: \u201cAdmit that ConvertKit is a failure and shut it down. Move on to something else. You\u2019ll be successful at whatever you do, so start something new.\u201d Ouch. That one hit hard.  \nAnd then he stops and says \u201cOr take ConvertKit seriously and give it the time, money, and attention it deserves and build it into a real business.\u201d  \n\n\nFor six months he ignored the recommendation. But as ConvertKit's revenue continued to shrink, he knew he had to make a tough call\u2014either pull the plug or go all-in.  \nHe devised a framework to help him make this decision and came up with two questions:\n\n1. **Do you still want this as much today as the day you started?**\n2. **Have you given this every possible chance to succeed?**\n\nUltimately, he saw he needed to do it and it needed real money.  \n*\u201cIf I quit today, I\u2019m always going to wonder could I have made that work?\u201d*  \n\n\nWith the company\u2019s underperforming revenue, Nathan knew investors wouldn\u2019t be lining up with bags of cash. So he took $5,0000 dollars out of their retirement savings and put it into the company. Most people told him not to do this, he was earning $50,000 per month from the books, while only $2,000 from the ConvertKit.  \n*\u201cIt\u2019s especially hard when you can\u2019t explain why you\u2019re doing the new thing. But everything in my gut is saying go after this. When you have that gut feeling of \u201cThis can be something\u201d you have to follow it.\u201d*  \n\n\nHe hired someone to work on ConvertKit full-time and pivoted the company to email marketing for bloggers, instead of being email marketing for anyone, and started doing direct sales.  \nThis was the inflection point and by the end of the year they closed out at $98,000 MRR.  \n\n\nLet\u2019s see how they were able to achieve this.\n\n# Scaling up\n\nThe real growth started happening when people began talking about ConvertKit.  \nHow were they able to generate word-of-mouth? Here\u2019s the process Nathan and the team at ConvertKit used to generate and convert leads:\n\n1. **Niching down**  \nInstead of trying to reach everyone, they narrowed their focus and went after smaller markets.  \n*\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to do direct sales, find a niche of 100 people. For example, I\u2019d start by thinking about professional bloggers, and I\u2019d narrow it down further, so let\u2019s say food bloggers. So, now we\u2019re talking about selling email marketing for professional food bloggers. But there\u2019s still a ton of professional food bloggers, so let\u2019s narrow it down further. How about email marketing for professional paleo recipe bloggers? Well, it turns out that there\u2019s even a lot of those. So let\u2019s go deeper: professional paleo recipe bloggers who are women. Now we have a niche.\u201d*  \nBy being very specific and claiming to be the email marketing solution for professional paleo recipe bloggers who are women, they were able to capture an audience that had been struggling with generic solutions not optimised for their needs.\n2. **Cold-email**  \nThey knew that once they\u2019d get one main customer in that niche, it\u2019d be much easier to convert other bloggers to use ConvertKit, as they all follow and talk with each other.  \nThey used cold-email to ask about these bloggers about the frustrations they were feeling with MailChimp, with a short and personal email.  \nNaturally most of them were frustrated with the platforms they were using, so they\u2019d engage and see the demo of ConvertKit. But they always shared the same problem: it was too much work to switch from one email provider to another.\n3. **Lock the customer**  \nSeeing this common issue, Nathan decided to make the switch for them for free.  \n\u201cIn the sales process, people had hung all of their objections on the idea that it was too much work to switch, and I learned that if I took that objection away by offering to do the switch for them for free, that took away nearly all of their reasons for not doing business with us.\u201d  \n*\u201cSo that\u2019s how we got customers. I would spend all of my time exporting subscribers from MailChimp, and swapping out signup forms on our customers\u2019 sites.\u201d*  \nThis was a time consuming task, it meant getting login credentials to their site, email provider, &amp; any plugins. Then they'd manually move everything over, including forms, sequences, templates, etc.  \nBut this is what was necessary to lock the customer.\n4. **Spread the word**  \nOnce they locked the customer, it was easier to reach the other potential customers.  \n*\u201cThis also creates buzz within the echo chamber, because people would reply to my emails and say, \u2018wow, that person is switching to ConvertKit? I keep hearing about you guys, it\u2019s like everyone is switching to ConvertKit!\u2019 When in reality, it just seems that way because the niche is so small.\u201d*  \nOnce they had everything settled and working properly, ConvertKit would ask these customers to refer to other bloggers.\n5. **Affiliate program**  \nAs a way to reward early promoters, they created affiliate programs and started hosting group demos and webinars to handle incoming leads.  \nToday, Convertkit has a team of 74 team members and has achieved over $32 million in revenue in 2022.\n\n# Main learnings\n\nThere is a lot to learn from ConvertKit\u2019s journey, both from its origins and its growth. The four main takeaways are:\n\n1. If you really want it, **do everything you can to make it happen**, even if it means giving up on other things.\n2. Follow your **gut feeling**. Even if others tell you not to do it, you owe it to yourself to try.\n3. Don\u2019t target millions. Search for the **niches of hundreds** and go at them one by one.\n4. **Do things that don\u2019t scale**. Even if that means doing tedious tasks for smaller customers, they will reward your efforts and refer you to other clients.\n\nIf you like this type of post, I write [weekly in-depth articles](https://thedisruptors.beehiiv.com/p/bootstrapping-convertkit-from-a-side-project-to-a-30-million-revenue-giant) on the early days and growth tactics from the most successful bootstrapped companies in the world.",

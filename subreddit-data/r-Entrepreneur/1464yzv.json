    "postText": "Last year I helped set up an online baked goods business for two bakers who used to previously sell from their home by word of mouth. I not only set up their LLC, but also the website, SEO, marketing campaigns, emails, the whole nine.\n\nThis month they have been offered a lucrative deal by a large brick and mortar retailer. These two bakers want me to be involved. I'm not a baker, and they understand that but they trust me as a business partner because I've helped shape their product line and marketing successfully. Whereas from home they sold a meager $50 thousand per year, they now make upwards of $1.5MM annually with the website and marketing help from me.\n\nMy question is this: how do I structure the partnership? I would like to have at least 20%, with the other two owning forty each. I will be responsible for online sales as well as marketing both online and in-store, plus communication with vendors and retailer landlord.  Is that a good way to do this?",

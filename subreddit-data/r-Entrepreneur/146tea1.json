    "postText": "Hi everyone, so here is my situation.\nI run a well known startup blog in my town (roughly 200k people in my area). We have a strong local economy with businesses that are known worldwide. Almost all startup interested people know my blog.\nMy problem is that the startup ecosystem is very small (but growing) and only very few people are actually reading my startup stories. There are two instances where startups became famous and visitors clicked my post, but then all the big national magazines also write articles about them and I lost my rank on Google.\n\nIt seems the local startups ecosystem is too small for ads and affiliate marketing to work properly.\nBUT, here is the fun part. I get lots of access to C-level execs and company owners due to my work. I just haven't found a way to monetize those connections in a proper way yet.\nDefinitely not interested in a quick buck or unprofessional approach. I have quiet a good reputation in my town and don't want to get burned.\nDo you guys have any ideas I may have been blind to? Any thought is welcome!",

Trying to sell ads manually isn't likely to make you much and be a huge pain in the ass. Could look at widening the scope of topics you cover and approach anymore traditional journalism route. \n\nBest I have would be to leverage your access and reputation into a position at one of these companies, which obviously may be something you have no interest in.",

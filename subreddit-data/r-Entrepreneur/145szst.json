    "postText": "In my pursuits of projects, one of the core goals has been monetisation. But as I\u2019ve matured and worked on projects and startups, I\u2019ve come to feel negatively about the pursuit of material wealth, and projects with the main purpose of monetary gain.\n\nI daydream about building for the sake of building, or for creativity, passion alone. \n\nFor context I\u2019ve started 2 startups (both failed, lost money first time, made money second time) and about to launch my third. My current project is a responsive development chrome extension.\n\nAnyone else in the same boat? This project could significantly change my financial situation (positively) but I\u2019m indifferent to it now that I\u2019m almost at the finish line.",

If not, just do it for the sheer enjoyment of it.\n\nIf you still need to make money, you can always just have a 9-5, have some one else pay you and then have your own time to work on projects that interest you.\n\nAnd who knows\u2026 maybe one of these personal pursuits will one day organically bring in some cash (or a lot of cash)\u2026 and if not, no big deal.\n\nStay indifferent \u2026 and curious.",

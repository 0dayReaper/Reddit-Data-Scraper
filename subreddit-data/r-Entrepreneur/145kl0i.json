This sounds easy but it's really lot of work, I will be making custom posters etc...\nI am not sure that this business will be successful, due to the competitions, even if its successful how much will I be expecting to earn per month.",

Anybody who could possibly answer such a wide open question has much better things to do with their time. And probably could buy their very own planet.\n\nYeah. If it's successful -- discounting all of reality to the contrary -- the money will be amazing. Go nuts. But of course I have no need to belabor the obvious.\n\nFor an encore I can now predict your country's winning lottery numbers. That might be, um ... quicker. You know ... for your convenience.",

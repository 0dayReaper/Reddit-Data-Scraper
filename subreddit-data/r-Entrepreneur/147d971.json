I wasn\u2019t sure what the most appropriate place would be to ask such question but considered this to be the most fitting sub. \n\nWhat are your thoughts about buying Lego sets, never using them, storing in the way that would keep their original condition and resell in future to collectors? Anyone knows how long one would have to wait to resell the sets to gain profit?",

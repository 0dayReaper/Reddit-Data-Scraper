    "postText": "A lot of you may recognize me from the post I did a few months ago regarding selling t-shirts on Amazon [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/56xvo1/how_we_made_150000_profit_slinging_tshirts_as_a](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/56xvo1/how_we_made_150000_profit_slinging_tshirts_as_a) and of course a ton of comments making jokes about the t shirt industry.\n\nSince Merch by Amazon (the program I was using in the old post), is still on lockdown, I am going to show you step by step how to take graphics/designs, and sell them on Amazon on 10\u2019s if not 100 different kind of items by using the new Shopify Amazon integration combined with print on demand services to fulfill your orders. This means you can take action TODAY.\n\nBefore any of you get on your pedestal about self promotion, yes, this did come from the [Merch Informer blog](https://merchinformer.com/shopify-amazon-merch-no-inventory-integration-guide/), and yes you can do this method I am about to lay out for you 100% without using any tools. If you want to learn something, continue reading. If not, continue on with your day. Let\u2019s do it.\n\n**What Is Merch?**\n\nIf you have been reading what I have been posting this last year, you may be thinking about Merch by Amazon where the focus was just t-shirts. Merch, however, goes a lot more broad than that. This can include anything from funny novelty t-shirts to flags you hang on your wall, to the yoga pants that are worn to the gym and everything in between.\n\nIf you have sold on Amazon before, or pushed t-shirts and realized how many customers you have access to, then you know how lucrative it can be. Shirts are just the tip of the iceberg though. If you could start selling beach towels, coffee mugs, yoga pants, flags, and any other type of merch without ever seeing or touching inventory on Amazon, imagine how your earnings would explode overnight.\n\n**Why Merch?**\n\n[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-revenue-1024x768.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-revenue-1024x768.png)\n\nAs you can see from the image above, Amazon is doing it\u2019s very best to capture as much market share as it can. That is literally all they care about, grow bigger than everyone else! At the very end of 2015, they opened yet another program to attempt to take over another sector of the market: Merch by Amazon. This program was aimed at dominating the print on demand (POD) niche, and it was an overnight success.\n\nThis program allowed everyday people and designers like you and I to put up original artwork and funny says on novelty t-shirts and sell them to Amazon customers without ever dealing with customer support or touching the actual product. Amazon sold, packaged, and shipped your products and gave the designer a royalty. Earnings from early adopters were absolutely massive and in some cases into the 100\u2019s of thousands of dollars.\n\nUnfortunately, Amazon did not expect the monster growth of the Merch by Amazon program and quickly turned it into an invite only program. Recently they have been processing so many orders that they have completely stopped accepting people to the program and people who do have an account are not allowed to publish or are allowed to publish with restrictions.\n\n[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/online-retailers.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/online-retailers.png)\n\nYou can see that if you want to make money online by selling apparel, you NEED to be selling on Amazon. There is really no other way around it. By 2020 they are going to be absolutely dominating the online market place and you have the chance to be a part of it.\n\nWith Merch by Amazon closed to the public, and not wanting to deal with shipping items from China or dealing with a print shop for every order, what can be done?\n\nFulfillment by Amazon is an option, but from our experience, not a very good good one. You would have to buy the products a head of time and send them to a ware house. With Merch by Amazon, we clearly know that selling Merch hands off is the way to go!\n\n[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Christmas.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Christmas.png)\n\n**Use Shopify To Sell Your Merch!**\n\nMany of you reading this are at least familiar with Shopify as a content management system and online store payment processor. From here, you will be able to put your products up for sale and sell them to customers who visit your site.\n\nWith recent changes and Shopify integrating with Amazon, this 100% the way to go. Why?\n\nYou will have access to not only T-shirts but\u2026.\n\n* \tTank Tops\n* \tPhone Cases\n* \tBeach Towels\n* \tCoffee Mugs\n* \tCutting Boards\n* \tStickers\n* \tLong Sleeves\n* \tHoodies\n* \tDog Bowls\n* \tFlags\n* \tBlankets\n* \tMouse Pads\n* \tShower Curtains\n\nand much more!\n\nAre you starting to see the big picture here? You can take the artwork that you created for shirts or other mediums, and turn a single image into 10s if not hundreds of different products that you will sell ON Amazon.com. No more handling inventory or trying to drive traffic to your store anymore.\n\nThis is going to be a long one, so strap in, and let\u2019s go over step by step on how to set up everything so you are no longer held back by Merch limits.\n\n**Shopify Amazon Print On Demand Method**\n\nTo make this method work for you, you are going to need 4 things.\n\n* Understand Amazon BSR (Best Sellers Rank) and what sells best on Amazon\n* Designs/Artwork\n* Amazon Seller Account\n* Shopify Account\n\nLet\u2019s go over how I get everything set up and then we will tie them all together.\n\n**Understanding What Sells on Amazon (Best Sellers Rank)**\n\nThe very first thing you need to do before you start your journey is understand what sells best on Amazon, how to spot these items, and how to properly research the different niches you want to create merch around. There are two very key aspects that you need to have a solid understanding of to have any success. These are Amazon BSR or Best Sellers Rank, and the second is understanding Copyright/Trademark.\n\n**Amazon BSR (Best Sellers Rank)**\n\nEvery single product that is sold on Amazon has something in the product information called the Best Sellers Rank or Amazon BSR. It will look very similar to this:\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BSR.png\n\nThe BSR is a representation of how well that item is selling in its respective category. The smaller the number, the more items they are selling. The higher number, the fewer items they are selling. For example, if a shirt were to hit number 1 in clothing, it would be the most popular shirt selling on Amazon.\n\nFrom my experience selling, a BSR of around 100,000 in clothing equates to around 1 sale per day. This is not set in stone, but 100k BSR is usually what I focus my sites on when doing niche research.\n\n**Copyright/Trademark**\n\nYou also need to have a full understanding that you are not allowed to infringe on someone else\u2019s copyright or trademarks. This means that you are NOT allowed to simply copy someones design and put it up on another piece of merchandise. Doing so would be breaking copyright laws.\n\nIf someone has a particular saying in their artwork that is selling particularly well, they might decide to trademark that term. This would mean that you are NOT allowed to use this term in any of your designs even if it looks completely different.\n\nCopyright and Trademark are both different beasts so make sure you are not infringing on someone else\u2019s intellectual property. A lot of times, you might put something up on Amazon which then gets trademarked later on down the road. They can then use this trademark to come after you and the items you put up causing infractions and an entire mess. If you have thousands of products up like we do, this can be almost impossible to keep track of. If you are at all concerned about this, make sure you are checking daily.\n\n**Getting Designs/Artwork**\n\nWhen I first started, I created some designs myself. Since I am not a designer by trade, this took a lot of my time up and I had to actually watch some tutorials on YouTube to make sure I was using Photoshop correctly. Once I saw just how well my designs were selling on Amazon, I started to scale up very quickly and this meant getting a designer (or 5), on board to start cranking out original designs. \n\nFinding a good designer can be extremely hard. You want one that you can count on to be on time, every time. You also want a designer that has some integrity and will be original when you send them ideas. I have managed to hire my entire team of designers at full time for $4 per design each. This may just be personal experience but a lot of them from the Philippines and this really ads up to a great wage in that part of the world.\n\nI have found excellent success by using [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com). Upwork is a marketplace to post jobs you are interested in completing and then hiring freelancers. Below is the script that I used to hire each one of my designers.\n\nHey, I am in need of 400 t-shirt designs in the time period of 2-3 months.\n\n&gt; Your task will be pretty basic, I will send you ideas of t-shirts I want to make and you make them yourself in your own unique style. For example, I might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and I would need you to be inspired by it and create a better version that is in your own creative style.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will leave a lot of 5* reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a long-term position. Once we have done the first batch of 400 \u2013 around 4 per day, we could continue if everything looks good.\n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to doing business with you!\n\nThis works well for me because I always have a lot of designs for them to do because I am quickly scaling up so they will have some long term work from me. It also works well because a lot of very talented people are new to the Upwork platform and are trying to build up their profile to find other jobs. Lots of great reviews from you as a satisfied client can help them in this journey. What this means for you is that they are going to put the best effort forward in order to earn those 5 stars.\n\n**Quick Note: Weeding Out Bad Designers**\n\nWhen I first tried to hire someone to design for me, they stole images and straight up copied designs. This is wrong, and will get your Merch account banned. I was not able to use any of these designs.\n\nWhen I first hired someone, I let them know that they cannot use any images which are Copyrighted, or infringe on any Copyright someone else owns.\n\nThen, I will send them a T-Shirt idea that is very clearly Copyright infringement. If they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use, I will immediately get rid of that designer (and that design). The design may have cost me $4, but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats!\n\n**Amazon Seller Account**\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle that you are going to need is is an Amazon seller account.\nYou can sign up for one here: [https://sellercentral.amazon.com](https://sellercentral.amazon.com)\n\nThis will ask you to sign into your Amazon account and if you do not have one already, simply sign up for one.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sign-up-for-Amazon.png\n\nOnce you are signed up and logged in, there are few things you are going to want to do.\nFirst you will want to navigate to the upper right hand corner to \u201cSettings\u201d and then Account Information. It will bring you to a page that looks like this:\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/information.png\n\nFill out the Deposit information so that you are going to get paid, and the tax information. Feel free to change any of the other information but for now all that you need to change is how you get paid, and the tax information.\n\nNext, navigate to the left hand corner of that page where you should see a \u201cYour Services\u201d box.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-services.png\n\nClick on Manage and then upgrade your account to a Professional Account.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-services.png\n\nThis offers you multiple benefits. It will cost you $39.99 a month, but\u2026\n\n* \tNo $0.99 Closing Fee for each item sold, only a monthly $39.99 subscription fee, referral fees and variable closing fees\n* \tAbility to collect US sales and use taxes on your orders\n* \tCustomize your shipping rates and services levels for all products (except Books, Music, Videos and DVDs)\n* \tManage your inventory using feeds, spreadsheets, and reports\n* \tManage orders using order reports and order-related feeds\n* \tAccess Amazon Marketplace Web Service to upload feeds, receive reports, and perform other API functions\n* \tAbility to offer Promotions and Gift Services\n* \tEligibility for Featured Merchant status and listing placement in the Buy Box.\n\nSimply put, If you are selling more than 40 pieces of merchandise a month, you are much better off get a pro account so you have higher profit margins. For this method to work with shopify, a Pro account is REQUIRED.\n\n**Shopify Account**\n\nGetting a Shopify account is extremely easy and they have a 14 day FREE trial.\nHead on over to [Shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com/) and click on the get started box in the upper right hand corner.\n \nYou will then just need to fill out your email address, password, and the store name you want to create.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/set-up-shopify-store.png\n\nClick on the big green create your store button and Shopify will start setting itself up.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/setting-up-a-store-300x177.png\n\n**Connecting Shopify and Amazon For No Inventory Fulfillment**\n\nNow that you have a fancy new Shopify store for free for the next 14 days, it is time to start taking advantage of what it has to offer. At first, your store will look just like this when you log in.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brand-new-created-store-1024x631.png\n\nIn the lower hand corner, you will see \u201cApps\u201d. Click on this.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apps.png\n\nWhat we are looking for here is an App that will fulfill all your orders for you. This is how we are going to print on demand without holding any inventory ourselves.\n\nSearch for Teelaunch. It will bring up the page for this app that looks like this:\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-app.png\n\nClick on the big green \u201cget\u201d button to install this app. You will need to quickly confirm that you want to install it on your shopify store.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/install-app.png\n\nClick on Install App and let it do its thing. Once the app is installed, go back to the left hand side menu, and click on Apps again. We are about to set up this app and add our first product.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-1024x164.png\n\nOnce you click on the app, you should see this dashboard:\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-product-1024x303.png\n\nClick on the Account button in the upper right hand corner. We want to make sure everything is set up to auto accept and fulfill orders.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-account.png\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-account-1.png\n\nFill out this page making sure that the top box says \u201cYES\u201d. You will need to add a credit card for the orders that you send Teelaunch. While you will be paying them the base price for the shirts and other merchandise orders you send them, you will be collecting the money from the sales in the Amazon central account.\n\nYou will also need to set Shopify to NOT automatically fulfill orders. To do this, go into your Shopify settings -&gt; Checkout and then in the Order processing section, unselect to automatically fulfill the order items. In most cases \u201cDo not automatically fulfill any of the order\u2019s line items\u201d will be selected which is the setting you want.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/auto-fulfill-1024x513.png\n\n**Adding Your First Piece Of Merchandise**\n\nNow we are finally ready to add our first piece of merch. From the teelaunch app, you will want to click on \u201cNew Product\u201d on the bar near the top of the page.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shirt-choices-1024x425.png\n\nThis is where you can see all the products that are available for you to put your designs on! Not only can you do shirts (which is what this entire tutorial is going to go over), but as mentioned above, there are so many other pieces of merch you can print and send to customers on Amazon. All without lifting a finger for the products yourself. Teelaunch will take the orders and ship them for you while you sit back and collect money off the designs and products!\n\nFor this method, we are going to be using the Gildan Unisex shirt. As you can see I have chosen that one on the screen. Once a product is chosen, scroll down to the bottom and click on \u201cStart Designing\u201d. This will bring up the product information and give you a little information about the shipping costs. This is also the space where you can upload your artwork to the shirts and pick what sizes and colors you want the shirt to be available in.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/publish-design-1024x536.png\n\nAs you can see, using this shirt, it will cost you $8.50 as a base price and $4 shipping.\nClick on \u201cChoose File\u201d to upload your design and then play around with dragging and dropping it as well as dragging the edges out so it displays properly on the shirt you want to list. I just took one of my Merch ready shirts to display how it would look. Pick a few colors and a few sizes.\n\n**Important**: You will need a separate UPC code for every single color and size variation you pick. I will go into this in detail further down, but it is best to not automatically select every color and every size.\n\nOnce the design is looking good, click on Review and publish Designs. This will bring up a page where you can add product tags, add your selling price, title and description.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/setting-up-shirt-1024x535.png\n\nOnce you are satisfied with how everything looks, go ahead and click on publish at the bottom of the page and your shirt will start processing in all the colors and variations that you have picked.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/processing-to-store-1024x328.png\n\nThis can take a little while if you pick a lot of sizes and colors. As you can see from the above picture, I have 48 different variants of just this one shirt! Once it goes through all of them, your shirt is now published in the back end of your shopify store.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shirt-uploaded.png\n\nThe entire point is to publish your goods on Amazon though right? To do this, we need to connect them now.\n\nGo back to the main shopify menu and click on \u201cAdd a sales channel\u201d. This is BRAND new from Shopify and why I am so excited!\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/main-menu.png\n\nYou can also find the same thing from the home page. It will be at the bottom. From the screenshot here, you can see you need to hit the install Amazon button to add this as a sales channel to your site.\n\nIf you are new to shopify, you do NOT need to create an online store since we are interested in only selling your products on Amazon using a print on demand service (teelaunch).\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Channel.png\n\nOnce that is installed, you should see the sales channel added to the menu.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-sales-channel.png\n\nGo ahead and click on it and it will more than likely ask you to update Amazon. This is what you want to go ahead and update the sales channel.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/update-amazon-plugin.png\n\nOnce it is updated, you will be able to access the page. From here, you want to be able to connect shopify to your Amazon sellers account we set up earlier.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/connect-Amazon-account-1024x176.png\n\nClick on Connect to Amazon. There is going to be a popup about Amazon MWS. You will need to agree to this. Essentially this is giving Shopify access to your seller central account so they can interact with each other properly.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/agree-to-Amazon-MWS.png\n\nOnce these are connected, you will see a screen that looks similar to this. You will see that the account is connected properly:\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/account-set-up-1024x544.png\n\nClick on the Listings in the left hand corner. We want to take the shirt we just put online and then put that shirt we created in Teelaunch onto Amazon.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sell-on-Amazon-1024x405.png\n\nClick on the sell on Amazon button. This will bring up a list of the products that you have on Shopify that you may want to sell on Amazon. Since we used Teelaunch to create a shirt, this is what is going to come up in the list.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/select-product-1024x419.png\n\nAfter you select the product that you want to list on Amazon, they are going to ask you if you are selling a product from another brand, or from your own brand. Select your own brand.\n\n**Note:** For all the Merch by Amazon users, this is your first real opportunity to build a coherent brand and put work into growing your brand on multiple sales channels. You have full control here and will even be able to respond to the reviews you get!\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/select-your-brand-1024x326.png\n\nWhen you pick that the product is made by your brand, you are going to come to the Amazon listing details. This is going to look very familiar to you if you have sold shirts on Merch before.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Listing-Details-1024x540.png\n\nEnter in the title, your brand name, the bullet points, and description. You will need to pick a category and will notice that you cannot sell the shirt for both genders at the same time. That is perfectly fine, you can go back after the shirt is live, and then sell the other genders version under the same listing.\n\nFinally, when you scroll down, you will see variants that you have chosen when you were creating the shirt. There will be one for every color and size combo that you created.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shirt-Varients.png\n\nFor each variant, go through and make sure the correct colored image is showing up for the title of that variant. As you can see from the above screenshot, I made sure the Royal Blue image is showing for the royal blue variant of the shirt.\n\n**SKU**\n\nYou will need a unique sku for every single varient of your shirt. Your visitors will never see the SKU or the UPC, but Amazon requires you to enter this information in for every shirt Variant.\n\nFor the SKU, head on over to [https://www.random.org/strings/](https://www.random.org/strings/) and select the following options and click go. You can generate however many strings you need by modifying the first box.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-for-SKUs-1024x622.png\n \nYou can use each line as one of your SKUs.\n\n**UPC**\n\nEach product and variant must have its own UPC code. These are 12 digit codes. If you have sold on Amazon FBA before, you may have used EAN. So far with the Shopify integration, these will not work so you will need the 12 digit UPC. I highly recommend buying these on Ebay. You can get 1000\u2019s of them for only a few dollars. Once you have them, enter a unique UPC for every variant of the product.\n\n**Clothing and Apparel Category Approval**\n\nYou will notice that Shopify tells you that you need approval from Amazon before you can list in this category. Click on the \u201capply to sell in this category\u201d link and open it in a new tab.\n\nMake sure you answer truthfully to these, but you will be auto approved in the end!\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apply-to-category.png\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apply-to-category-2.jpg\n\nThe next step is going to be answering some questions about the images you will use. Go through the questionnaire and make sure you answer them all properly. Remember that the images you will be using are being pulled from Teelaunch so they are all good to go with Amazon\u2019s requirements.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-image-requirements-1024x515.png\n\nAfter that is complete, fill out the information and submit your application!\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/submit-clothing-application.png\n\nAfter you hit Submit Application you will now be instantly approved and can go back to your shirt listing you were working on in the other tab!\n\n**Finishing Amazon Listing**\n\nNow that you have your SKUs and UPCs listed on each variant of the product, it is now time to submit your product listing. If everything has been entered properly, your listing will go through!\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/listing-created-30-min-to-live-1024x173.png\n\nAs you can see from the image above, the listing has been successfully submitted to Amazon. Your listing should be listed in a pending status. This generally will change within 30 minutes to live and you will have a link to your product on Amazon.com.\n\n**Note On Shipping**\n\nWhen your product finally goes live and you check it, you might notice that the shipping is higher than you expected. Well, you can change this! The shipping is all controlled within your Amazon seller central account.\n\nHead on over to your Amazon account and find the Shipping Settings and then Shipping Templates. Click on Edit Template and then you will be able to pick what type of shipping you will charge your customers.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot, I decided to change shipping from $4.49 for everyone, to $2.99 for the lower 48 states.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shipping-times-1024x461.png\n\n**ROI Calculations**\n\nThis is going to vary per shirt depending on what you price at. Keep in mind that with certain products you may be making a lot larger percentage. You might be making 100% ROI with yoga mats for example.\n\nFor shirts though, if you are pricing at 17 dollars, and charging 3 dollars shipping, then the total charge will be around $20. With Amazon fees around $3, and the t-shirt costing you $12.50 (cost of the shirt plus shipping) and a 30c Shopify fee, this leaves you around $4.25 profit for something you never touched! Scale that up by a few hundred if not thousands of shirts you are making great money.\n\nScale it up even further with the multitude of products you can reuse your designs on, and now you are talking about MASSIVE money, all from your original designs.\n\n**Getting Your First Sale on Shopify with Amazon**\n\nNow with your listings live, you are probably going to get some sales. When you get a sale, they will show up in Shopify (as well as seller central). Make sure you are only dealing with the orders through Shopify though.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/first-order.png\n\nGetting your first order feels great! What is even better though is that from here it is 100% hands off.\n\nIf you go back down to apps and then go into the Teelaunch app, you should see this:\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-production-1024x360.png\n\nWithout touching it, your shirt is now being made with Teelaunch and will be shipped to your customer as soon as it is complete. This is possible for t shirts and all other products that teelaunch offers.\n\n**Fulfilling Orders Manually**\n\nIf your orders are not automatically going through to Teelaunch, you will need to do them manually. The only reason this may be happening is that the Shopify/Amazon integration is BRAND NEW and I have been assured by higher ups that this is being worked on and will be fixed soon if anyone does encounter it.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF9EMFzsXOI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF9EMFzsXOI)\n\n**Getting Revenue From Amazon**\n\nIn order to get your money from your seller account on Amazon to your bank account, you need to have a few things.\n\nThe first thing is that you must have valid credit card information on file for verification and billing purposes. This is why you added this when you set up your seller account.\nThe second thing you must have is valid bank account information so a transfer can occur. This can be added in the \u201cmy profile\u201d section of your seller central account.\n\nBasically the way it will work is that after you get a sale, it will show up in your Shopify account. Once the order is marked \u201cfulfilled\u201d, the buyer will be emailed to let them know that their product is on the way. The funds held within Amazon will be deposited to your account every 14 days. The good news is that you can request funds faster than that! Here is what Amazon has to say on the subject.\n\nhttps://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amazon-payment.png\n\n**Wrapping It Up**\n\nThe Shopify/Amazon integration represents a REAL massive opportunity in the print on demand space and is going to see plenty of people make millions of dollars a year. In order to take advantage of this opportunity successfully you need only a few things:\n\n* \tKnow what sells on Amazon\n* \tBe willing to WORK and scale your business\n* \tKnow how to properly optimize your Amazon listings\n\nIf you are not hopping on this opportunity today, you are 100% leaving money on the table that is there for the taking. There is zero need to run traffic, zero inventory to hold, and 100\u2019s if not 1000\u2019s of possibilities for making money with the crazy selection of products you can now put for sale on Amazon.\n\nThat about raps it up ladies and gentlemen. Any questions ask them below.\n",

Some will be used by other sellers. Some will conflict with legit products. Risky business.\n\nIf you want UPC codes that will not really work, save the $2 and do the math yourself. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit#UPC  \n\nThat will make \"valid\" but \"very likely used by someone else\" UPC codes.\n\nTo actually obtain UPC codes, you need to spend money and talk to http://www.gs1-us.info/",

It strikes me as a way of ensuring that products meet a certain threshold of either investment and/or branding, and I guess it does what it is suppose to do, which is to make listing products more difficult. \n\nWhile I do like OP's concept and appreciate the clear step-by-step, it seems to me that UPCs become a linchpin in this process. For most, owning GS1 licensed UPCs probably won't work for hundreds (or even just dozens) of small scale t-shirt listings. I don't see how brand registry will work either given that you need to show packaging and branding for each product. Given that you need a legit UPC or GCID, there doesn't appear to be a workable option that wouldn't put your sellers account at risk. Or maybe I've missed something?",

Priority is in fact Amazon's ASIN, the one with the logo (letter A and QR code), but there are also international bar codes (LPN) they cover UPC. Next goes bar codes starting with X00, which indicates that item is sold as is. If there is a conflict between products, like the same UPC assigned on multiple products, Amazon verifies and prints out codes that start with B00 and they cover bad UPC, in which case vendor is getting charged for this because Amazon is spending labor for re-stickering. And last one of course is UPC, vendor provided bar code. If you've ordered from Amazon then you've seen X00 and B00 bar codes covering the original UPC. \n\nSource: not so glamorous work experience.

Just want to be clear about that. For anyone that does this, make sure you have a high enough credit limit and that you set everything on autopay so that your cash flow looks like this every 14 days: Amazon sellers account -&gt; bank account -&gt; credit card. That way you aren't caught with a payment due on your credit card and not enough funds in the bank.",

You will end up spending around 400.00 to do this and end up with maybe a dozen sales if you are lucky.. unless your designs are sick as hell, which OP says nothing about.

You're describing the equivalent to a million-candle-power solution for a flashlight problem. \n\nIf you're looking to crush the same numbers OP is stating then yes, you gotta hustle a lot harder. As a supplement to your income? Maybe a dinner out with the missus a couple times a month? A lot more manageable. \n\nThe trick is level of motivation. \n\nI have a buddy now who hit a mark, and his sole goal was just replacing his existing income so he could quit his job. I know another guy who's sole goal in life was to buy a Cessna. Both were arguably equally motivated. \n\nThe first guy hit the mark after a year, and grew it to an 8-figure business that's still going strong. The other earned exactly what he needed to buy the plane in a little less than a year, **bought the fucker**, and promptly closed the doors on it. \n\nBoth extreme examples, but both were in the same essential business model. \n\nThe thing that definitely separated the two was when the former hit his initial goal, he started to do a LOT of the stuff you mentioned above with social media, and grew accordingly. \n\n*But to just start..?* That's a lot of shit you **don't** need in order to, you know, *just start*.

I had Merch when it first came out, then I also used Redbubble. Finally I did the whole Shopify thing, got my own domain, and did all the marketing involved. I went down in flames. Used a lot of money to keep it going, using Printaura, The Printfull, etc.. I was getting complaints from customers about the designs being un-centered, uneven, too big or too small, or faded.. so I found a guy to DTG my shirts locally. It worked for a little while but became a full time job along with my real job and it just didn't make sense.\n\nNow I just use Sunfrog and market my designs on my Instagram and Facebook page. I sell a few here and there. Check out my Instagram to see my designs - http://www.instagram.com/9thpan they aren't that spectacular but I was trying to hit a niche in the culinary tee shirt market. Too much competition from Truecooks, and Chef To The End.. IMO.. so you see what I am saying.. \n\n",

You do this by looking at the BSR in the category you are looking at. Lower the number, more that niche is selling, and tells you that you can create better products/designs and compete. ",

My designs look good and I placed them in a couple of different niches. Funny sayings, funny animals, cute animals, sarcastic mugs. Something like that. \n\nAll of my mugs are based on other popular mugs. Some have lots of competition because of that, but many of my mugs have little competition despite being a popular item. I've also tried out different titles, bullet points and keywords. I've messaged the topic starter numerous times and he's been extremely helpful by giving me tips on how to improve my titles and bullet points. I've followed his advice because it seems to be working for him. \n\nI started out with a low price and a low shipping cost but made no sales. So I thought that maybe people liked to see free shipping. So I upped my price and enabled free shipping. I'm now priced as low as making a profit of $1.45 per mug. That is, of course, if I were to sell a single one. \n\nMy designs are based on popular designs, but I've made them original. Some of my designs show up on the first page when searching for certain mugs. To be honest, I had expected a single sale by now. Especially considering the design and price I'm offering. I literally can't go any lower or it wouldn't be worth it. If I were to price them any lower, I'd be looking at a profit of $0.45 a mug. \n\nThen again, the only way to make this work is to get consistent sales. I wouldn't even be happy with 10 sales in three weeks, even though I'm still at 0. I don't understand it at all. At this price I'd need a little over 20 sales a day to reach $1k/month. I'm pretty sure that's never gonna happen. At this point I feel like I'd need 1000 mugs just to get some consistent sales. \n\nI'm happy I tried it but right now I don't see the point of continuing. There's not a single person in this topic who has reported some decent sales. Not one. The thread has 5.5k upvotes so I'm guessing lots of people gave it a try. In fact, I know lots of people did because I keep seeing new seller profiles with the same image of a mug that Teelaunch uses in niches I'm targetting. \n\nAnd what's the highest number of sales that someone reported in this thread? Somewhere around 10. It's been a whole month. ",

                    "comment": "Agreed, and /u/W1ZZ4RD is literally **printing the directions** for doing this in his post... \n\nWhich leads me to some equal parts encouragement (for the right mindset) and *discouragement* for the daisy-cutters who just look for ways to tear into someone who wants to share information like these types of posts offer.\n\nThere's a bunch of comments higher up in this thread, with a ton of skepticism and incredulity, and questions about why he would be doing this... With all of the conspiracy theories that go along with that line of thinking. We see this happen with **every** entrepreneur who posts guides, helpful hints, and step-by-step instructions. \n\nHealthy pragmatism and genuine questions are fine, good, necessary even. It's just *so unhelpful* in here to trash **everyone** who tries to help out with good, free information like this. \n\nOr worse, look for (or make up) reasons why this dude is just sitting around twisting his mustache and laughing maniacally. \n\nThere's always going to be a certain number of people in the world who think the world is just one big line at the DMV. \"This sucks, that sucks, everything sucks..\" kind of people. Maybe they were burned. Maybe they're discouraged. Maybe they got hornswaggled. It happens. \n\nThe thing is, that kind of thinking keeps you out of all arenas you might get into to try and improve your life or state of prosperity. \n\nIt happens that some asshats do in fact post up obvious clickbait-y, self-serving pablum horseshit in an effort to sell their snake oil. That happens when some douche-canoe thinks you're flawed, damaged, or stupid. People who start from this premise are the ones you have to ignore. The good news is that it's pretty goddamned obvious when they ARE doing just that. Ignore or report them accordingly. \n \n... But we do this with every. fucking. time. to every. fucking. one of them, regardless of the method's efficacy or validity. We demand absolute proof. Surety. Concrete everything. It's not legit to you unless OP does it all for you. They don't satisfy every condition (including the ridiculous demand that you see their personal financials) and you decry the whole thing. It's ridiculous. \n\nWe see people argue for why they *can't* and never ask, **\"How can I personally apply this safely and effectively?\"** \n\nOne (or many) people are just going to see something like this and trash it without even considering that he's doing it because, \"Holy shit! This is simpler than I thought! It's not easy per se, but if you hustle and do it, you can make something!\" \n\nThe motivation might be genuinely altruistic or positive. But please remember - It's information for free. At some point, you gotta either step on the track or get out of the way.\n\nAnd hell, even if he does pick up a few more views to his blahg or get a few clients for an SaaS, why begrudge him for providing a massive amount of value up front, FOR FREE, and not overtly selling anything?\n\nTo those who are asking about competition, I'd say this -  \n\nHe's not worried about the competition, because ***you're not competing with him***. Online sales (and online retailers like Amazon and Alibaba in particular) are arguably the largest marketplace in the world. There's room for plenty of stuff to sell in the world. \n\nI've sold all kinds of shit that doesn't make sense to someone outside that particular loop. I've personally sold newsletters, and supplements, and meeting space, and training, and on and on and on... Hell, my first corporate gig was getting on the hone and selling *fucking pens*. Not even fancy pens, just shit-ass neon-colored pens with a business' address on them! \n\nMy point is if there's people in the marketplace, instead of looking for a market where no one is, shouldn't you be looking in a place that's still growing? That has some people in it already, and a larger, hungry (and growing) audience? He's giving you a guide to how you can do that IN AMAZON, with available tools, with no pre-purchasing up front, and simply the time and effort necessary to try it out. \n\n***So try it out. Aim Small, Miss Small.*** \n\nHell, I've decided to try it out  just on the ridiculously easy manner with which he laid it out, and I already have 2 businesses going now. This might speak to me needing a hobby, but that's a different discussion entirely... *I digress.* \n\nI guess what I want to say is **thank you** to OP, encourage you to **try out something**, ANYTHING in an effective and minimally-risky manner (like the one he outlined) and ask the daisy-cutters in here to please **chill the fuck out** with always looking for a way to tear someone down when they try and help the people in here. \n\nMaybe it's not for you... But JEEBUS, stop kicking every person in the dick who is trying to help others with a basic guide like this. Stop arguing for your own limitations, or foisting them on everyone else. \n\nYou're obviously in here because you think owning or running a business is a way to improve your lot in life right now.. \n\n**So try something.** \n\nIt's only a failure if you don't learn anything from it... \n\nBut it's a crime if the only thing you learn from the data and experience is to be cynical and actively discourage others.

Shopify clearly states that they are currently only accepting products in the clothing category.  I know this because I spent quite some time putting together a new iPhone case design, only to then find out I can't list it.\n\n3) I don't see how we can compete on prices.  To take the aforementioned iPhone case example, Teelaunch charges $11 out of the gate for this.  Meanwhile on Amazon most iPhone cases cost $9 and have prime delivery.\n\nThose are the roadblocks I've run into trying to turn this into a reality.  I have significant experience building companies, and I also do my own design work.  So I thought this would be a cool thing to explore, but I don't see how I can make this work.",

            "comment": "Hi , W1ZZ4RD! Thanks for the great content. This post was a catalyst for me as it brought the barrier to entry for Ecommerce low enough that I felt capable of taking action. Can't thank you enough for that. For anyone wondering if this stuff works I can say honestly that it does. It just takes sustained effort over a period of a few weeks to get all of the kinks worked out before you will see the first sale. It will come. I've used UPC's from ebay and have seen no negative repercussions thus far. I'm about 2 months in and have sold 10 items. Here's my biggest takeaway: *I have yet to sell any normal shirts.* It seems that the easiest way to decrease the amount of competition you're up against is to sell anything other than a classic unisex shirt. Probably due to the current season, Tank tops (women's in particular) are doing the best for me, though I've sold 2 hoodies too. My goal is to scale to a sale per day by the end of June, and 30 sales per day by the end of the year, at which point I will be financially free(!!!). For those interested in realistic start up numbers, my cost so far has been $15/mo for shoppify, $10/mo for merch informer, $40/mo for the amazon seller account, and $120 for 30 designs by my designer on UpWork, a total of $250 for the first 2 months. Of the 30 design's I've had made, I've only been able to make 5 of them into active listings on Amazon due to difficulties with Amazon listing creation policies (if you create too many variants in a day or in a week they will deactivate your ability to make new listings and you have to call support to get it sorted out...I'm putting each design on every piece of tee launch clothing that makes sense for the design, meaning I have a shit load of variants for each design). My sales have been roughly 1 per week for the entire catalog, so roughly speaking for every 5 designs you put up you should expect a total of 1 sale per week (while secretly hoping to strike gold with a design that brings in 50 sales a day). This means to reach the goal of 1 sale per day (7 sales per week), you need to get a total of 35 shirt designs listed (each on a variety of tank tops, hoodies, baby onesies, etc.). At that point your monthly cashflow should be (profit: $4 * 30 items = $120) - (expenses: Shopify + Amazon Seller's + MerchInformer = $65) = $55/mo, meaning you'll recoup your startup cost of $250 in 5 months or hopefully much less if you scale. Hope this will be helpful for someone. If anyone has feedback or see's any gaps in my logic I'd love to hear your comments. Thanks again W1ZZ4RD!",

I'm guessing this calculation probably depends on how much time you spend with each product (getting the design, importing the product and setting it up, record keeping, etc.), but I'm just trying to get a feel for the process and set realistic goals for myself if I go down this path. Thanks again!",

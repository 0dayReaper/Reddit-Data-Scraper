    "postText": "Hey everyone.\n\nIt's Jake here. The landscaper guy.\n\nSeeming as some saw my previous post as unhelpful and a brag, I will begin posting parts of my guide to starting a service based business .\n\nThis particular aspect is one of the most important. Once you get it down, its quick and highly effective. It makes it look like you care, are an expert in your trade, and also saves you a lot of headaches down the road if you ever need to ask for more money if you've underquoted or if the customer changes their mind.\n\nAlso remember the definition of a quote is a \"written estimate\" . A lot of clients think that a quote is the final price, but that's not always true. Things change and extras pop up like finding things under the ground you couldn't prepare for, material delays, faulty materials, changing access to the job etc. Never be scared to ask for money if it's reasonable . This part took me along time to find the courage for, but I was losing thousands of dollars a year due to things out of my control.\n\nAnyway,\n\nWrite your quote. I dont itemise my quotes as then clients can work out your profit margins. I've had maybe 3 people ask for an itemised quote out of 500+ and I've always politely said no.\n\nThe next part is what will serperate you from your competition.\n\nCreate a Google document. Create a professional looking header .\n\nTitle it with the job description. Date it. \nThen use subheadings.\n\n\"Job overview\"\n\nWrite a brief description of the job. Italicized and underlined.\n\nThen go through step by step with headings for every part of the job.\n\nFor a landscaping job for me it would be something like.\n\nEXCAVATION\n- supply all plant and machinery required for earthworks.\n- excavate 120mm below finished turf height.\n- remove all spoil to truck provided and cart offsite.\n- \"allowance for 20 CBM soil removal.\n\nCONCRETE PREP\n- mechanically excavate 130mm below finished concrete height.\n- supply and install 30mm crushed rock base. Mechanically compact with vibrating plate \n- supply SL72 sheet mesh \n\nEtc etc\n\nDo that for every step of the job.\nThis will makke you look professional and like you know what you're doing.\n\nBut most importantly it will make sure the client knows exactly whats happening. And if anything on the scope of works changes, you have something to refer to allowing you to charge more if you need to . \n\nI also include a link to myterms and conditions and outline the process for any variations or extras.\n\nThen for the next client just copy it, change the date and the sections to suit.\n\nI went from converting 30% to 60% from including a descriptive scope of works document. \n\nOther businesses literally text a quote or email it. This is where you can shine.",

            "comment": "Hey landscaper guy. \n\nExcellent post.  In my business I've also discovered the power of super detailed quotations. \n\nHowever, you're missing out on something here. Your quotation is appealing to the **logical** part of the brain. But excellent marketers know that you also need to speak to their **emotional** brain also. \n\nHow do you do this? Well landscaping is ideally suited to emotional appeals. You get your very best photographs of past work and include them with with your quotation. I recommend a PDF brochure style - designed by a graphic designed who uses a minimalist style. You want them going \"*oh, my garden could look like that also*\".\n\nLastly, you know and I know - the real reason they're getting the garden done. It's to impress their neighbours and bolster their own status and ego. Allude to this in a subtle way in your PDF brochure. \n\nSo along with your quotation, you now have the power really super-charge your marketing. Good luck!",

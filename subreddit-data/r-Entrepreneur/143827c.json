    "postText": "I've recently started a cold email marketing agency and many redditors claimed that sending cold emails is totally illegal as it is spam and said \"good luck getting hefty fines\". Harsh penalties of up to $43,792 for violations! That stressed me out (had a stress attack, is that a thing lol), so I went on to research and found out..\n\n**SPAM emails are different from COLD emails.**\n\nEmails are considered spam when sent in mass unsolicited email campaigns to a random list of recipients without checking whether they are relevant or not. Usually, such emails go straight to the user's spam folder. And obviously such emails are illegal.\n\nI learned that as long as cold emails are done right, they are completely legal.\n\nHere's how to do it right:\n\n1. Email addresses should be collected from publicly available databases, such as LinkedIn or other social media platforms\n2. Only sending emails to recipients that are interested in your offer (for Corporate) or have opted in your email list (individuals)\n3. Never use false, misleading or deceptive information, especially in the email \"from\" \"reply-to\" and subject of the email\n4. The message in the email should be clear, if it is an advertisement then it should be clearly stated. If it's a request for meeting, it should be stated. You get the point.\n5. Including valid physical address at the bottom of your email (in your signature preferably)\n6. (MOST IMPORTANTLY) Give an option for the recipient to opt-out from the mailing list and process the opt-out request within 7-10 days.\n7. The UK requires you to have consent of the individual before sending them an email, however for corporations that is not the requirement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: Cold emails are a powerful way to boost you business's revenue, if done right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm not a legal advisor, and this is not a legal advise. I'm simply sharing my research, kindly correct me if any point I mentioned is incorrect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Corrected point 2",

In germany its completly forbidden to send ANY email to a company, no exceptions.\n\nThe only way is to double opt in, written statement or proofable \"yes\" through a phonecall. But without consens youre not allouwed to record a call.\n\nEdit: It counts only for B2B, Cold emails like customer acquisition",

We didn\u2019t expect the business to succeed starting out and just thought we would throw some money at the project (money we were willing to risk) to test a hypothesis we had.\n\nLesson learnt: the less attachment to success, the higher the probability for success (or maybe it was just sheer luck). Either way it was a fun experience.",

I'm now 4 months in and making about $2500/month profit after all my service fees taken off... this is only a side business, though. I'm only working on this in the evenings. Im considering bringing on someone part-time to help me out so I can scale it more. We shall see!",

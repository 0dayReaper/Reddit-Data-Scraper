Just \"Screwdriver.\" More punchy. \n\n\nThe marketing/graphic design practically writes itself. It's actually a pretty catchy idea from a marketing standpoint, since your market is mainly 25-45 year old guys, and we all like to at least think we appreciate manly tools. Starting a new brewery business is all about building a brand following. A theme like this could really help you do that quickly. ",

The lesson that I took away from the book is that recognize if you're a technician or a manager as early as possible. Technicians are artists that like to do the things (cooking, painting, programming, etc.) that they think will turn into a successful business whereas the manager is someone that can separate him/herself from the \"art\" side of business and be able to sell, market, and manage. It's not impossible to be both but it's important to be in the correct mindset when taking on either task. At least this is what I remember of the book. I might be completely wrong.",

It is because I grew up poor, and my belief is that government's role is to increase the minimum standard of living for everyone and not to pander to either a social or economic elite.",

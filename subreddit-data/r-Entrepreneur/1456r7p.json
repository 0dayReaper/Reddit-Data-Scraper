    "postText": "The situation at my startup is that i am the lead technical founder (also a full stack developer) and my other two members are my school friend named Joe and a college friend Mark whom i want to join my startup as my co-founder. Joe is a PG in mathematics and looking for work while Mark is a self-taught front-end developer and an MBA grad, but if they find any decent job they will hardly contribute to my startup. Also, i built the MVP( a SaaS-based software platform) on my own and currently working full-time on my startup while doing other things, from pitching investors to marketing.\n\nAs a founder, i know how difficult is to raise funds as a solo and that's the reason i want them to join me but at the same time i want absolute authority and don't want to share my equity but am willing to give decent payroll to each co-founder. \n\nI need to know if is that possible and what investors think of it, will it affect raising funds or perhaps my startup?",

Would you rather have 100% of a grape or 50% of a watermelon?  Because if you bring the right co-founder on, whoever that may be, they can help your company grow at least that much.",

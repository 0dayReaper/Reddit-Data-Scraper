    "postText": "Companies like Barstool Sports, Pubity, MemeZar (owned by Pubity), PubityEarth (it's just travel content), basically any Instagram / TikTok Page owned by Pubity.\n\nI mean more specifically on TikTok than on Instagram. They have massive amounts of viewers and followers, and all they do is repost other people's content, which is great for them! But there's no visible ads they post on their social media pages or anything, which I assume is how post of these social media pages make money apart from merchandise, affiliate sales etc..\n\nSo how do they make money? I want to start a media company like this but from the Caribbean where I live.\nThere are no companies like this, so I'd be the first. Yeah I plan to produce my own content depending on the account, but how do they actually make money JUST by reposting people's content?\n\n(I want to start pages about Caribbean music, sports, those kindness videos, gaming and business. but some of these require me to JUST repost other people's content (with their permission ofc)\n\n\u2022\n\nEdit: TikTok accounts like these! I just came across this one. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@tofumedia?_t=8d67NBPqXVl&amp;_r=1\n\nThey produce music stories. They have a YouTube channel linked to their account but they don't actively push viewers to there. This is tricky.",

We don\u2019t earn much and bats are expensive but it\u2019s honest work",

TikTok Store. I don't know how it works, but there should be some fees upon purchase.\n3. Live streaming gifts. People tend to send gifts when they like what the streamers do. The gift brings revenue to both TikTok and the streamers (not sure how it is divided).\n\nIt's a pretty healthy platform so far.",

            "comment": "Brand Partnerships: While it may not be obvious, these companies often have partnerships with other businesses. They may subtly promote products or services within their posts, or create content that aligns with a brand's message.\r\n\nSponsored Posts: Even if they don't post traditional ads, they may have deals to post sponsored content. This could include featuring a product, service, or event in their content, for which they get paid.\r\n\nContent Licensing: Sometimes, they might license their content to other media outlets. If they post something that becomes very popular, news sites, other social media accounts, or even TV shows might pay to use it.\r\n\n\r  \nAffiliate Marketing: As you've noted, affiliate sales can be a source of income. They might recommend products or services and get a commission for any purchases made through their links.\r\r  \n\r  \nFor your Caribbean venture, you might focus on building relationships with local businesses for partnerships and sponsored content, showcase regional products for affiliate marketing, and leverage local trends and interests for content that could be licensed. You could also look at creating unique merchandise or offering premium content specific to the Caribbean audience.",

We started with speakerphone and ended up on discord for some. I never went above $25/HR. They had no issues with the rate.",

Community activities, social events, and volunteer networks can address this issue.\n\n  \nTransportation: Lack of accessible transportation limits elderly mobility. Affordable transportation and volunteer driver programs can make a difference.\n\n  \nHome adjustments: Seniors may need home adaptations for safety and accessibility to age in place. Affordable or subsidized home modifications can improve their quality of life.\n\n  \nTechnology education: Some seniors find technology intimidating. Smartphone, tablet, and other device training can help people stay connected, access online resources, and enhance their digital literacy.",

I would say if you have a car there is no entry barrier. Go to a church, mosque or any place of worship and that is where you find clients :D",

But you are asking people on the forum to do your homework for you. \n\nHere's is how a social forum might work in theory: You conduct standard, eighth grade level homework and *contribute to the forum*. This in turn, one would hope, gets the community to participate right back -- I think the term is engagement. \n\nAnd only then do you strip-mine the forum for your own benefit. But first you need to propose. \n\nSo what do mortuary-bait types want that isn't covered by the senior discount, prune juice, and Matlock-on-DVD? Hmm... \n\n...Teaching them about computers is no good, most have recruited a technician from the crotch fruit and harass a family member. Now, helping THAT poor bastard -- the hapless family IT support person -- could work out *indirectly*.",

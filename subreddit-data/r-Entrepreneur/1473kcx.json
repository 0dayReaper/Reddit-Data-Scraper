    "postText": "I'm about to turn 18, and i want to become an  entrepreneur because i can't think myself as a longterm office-worker. I don't know where to begin when there are many Millionaires that gives advice like Iman gahdzi, that gets labels as fake guru; it's hard to know what to consider as good or bad advice.\n\nI am eager to learn more and i have questions that i would be glad if you could answer.\n\n1. What inspired you to start your own business? Was it money or being your own boss?\n\n2. How should i begin my journey? How did you begin?\n\n3. What kind of business model did you begin with and do you still work with it?\n\n4. Is it really possible to become a multi-millionaire as people like Iman gahdzi?\n\n5. What is an advice you would give yourself when you began that you could share with me?\n\n6. Is it smarter to start an online business rather than a business that requires you to stay in the same area?\n\nI live in Sweden and we have a low population if you compare with USA or England. I don't know if it's harder to start a business when there is a lower population if it isn't online.",

Is it your first business? \n\nIf you have any more experience of businesses, how am i supposed to expand my business that is a solution to a problem, if it's service based where i am doing manual labor and there aren't many customers in my area?",

As for suggestion for your specific case, I don't know much about your demographic and geographic location, so I can't provide any specific help, but the AI Advisor might. \n\nLet me know one way or the other if u find the AI-Advisor advice/answer useful?",

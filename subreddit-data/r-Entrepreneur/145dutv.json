    "postText": "I run my own social media management business and landed a long term client just starting their business. I like their product and there is huge potential as there is basically no competition in the surrounding area. Currently I'm charging $750/month for my services and will be adding in more services later on brining it to $1000+ within a year. They pitched me a offer of doing profit sharing to encentivise me to push harder as more sales more income... I just want to see if my math makes sense. \n\nThey told me their estimated revenue leading up to 2027. 250-300k by 2025 and 500k by 2027. By my simple math... I'm making between $9-13k based off my monthly rates... what would make a fair profit sharing percentage as they are just starting out? At $250k to even just break even I'm looking at taking 4-5% of their business and that's not even guaranteed. I'm not sure what they are willing to give up but in a year is when they want to discuss and I thought I'd get a leg up on thr idea for when we negotiate.\n\nMy thoughts were to set a minimum monthly rate and also add in a % of profit sharing. That way I'm not completly screwed if there is a down season for them and set up a yearly contract so that they can't use me for the off season and once things pick up, leave me high and dry. Less potential on income, but the safety net of guaranteed profit on my work.\n\nThoughts?",

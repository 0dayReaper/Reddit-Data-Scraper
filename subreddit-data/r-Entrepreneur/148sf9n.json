            "comment": "I think of motivation as something that is always there, it just gets hidden by fear. If you had a hard time with your previous company, you may have internalized that starting a company leads to pain.\nThere are so many ways to work around this, but know that it's OK to be frustrated with your journey sometimes.\n\nWhat has often popped me out of a bad mood is helping someone else. Finding a way to be there and serve one person. This could be something that turns into a business, or it could just be listening. \n\nIt's ok to take a job! No shame in it. Take your entrepreneur's mindset with you: pay attention to problems that people have that you want to solve. Start by solving them, simply; see if you are enjoying that, and if so consider if you'd like to turn it into a business.",

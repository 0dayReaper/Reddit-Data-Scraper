    "postText": "My husband grew up in construction and runs a successful exterior and home building business in the Midwest. We have three children, another on the way (I\u2019m a homeschooling stay at home mom) and while we both enjoy the challenge and rewards of entrepreneurship, to say our personal lives are imbalanced would be a huge understatement. \n\nThe greatest challenge has been the necessity of his physical presence on the job. We are both tired of feeling as though we are always reacting, never grounded, rarely in control. \n\nMy husband is driven, friendly, competitive, and can work anyone under the table. I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m constantly imagining what a change could look like. An online business. An overseas move. Anything to make this life feel a little more like it\u2019s ours. He is open to these conversations but they never get too far, because as always, something more urgent comes up and it gets tabled. \n\nI know this post is quite vague, but I\u2019m looking for opinions from people who have made a big shift or advice on how to think these things through. I\u2019ve felt like we have been in a holding pattern for some time. Any thoughts are welcome!",

You might end up with a little less money in your pockets, but by hiring confident workers to oversee employees you'll be buying some balance in your life.\n\nIf the business is going well you don't really need to pivot. That's for situations when the business isn't working and you need to find an alternative way to deliver your product or service.",

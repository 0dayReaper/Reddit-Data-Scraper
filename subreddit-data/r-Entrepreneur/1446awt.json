We just want to be able to see how many people reach our pages through facebook specifically.\n\nAlso I have thought about using UTMs but I don't want those big links our audience seeing it and again If we shorten it, The tracking will inaccurate and might break?",

            "comment": "I understand your concern about the aesthetics of the long UTM links. However, you can still use a URL shortener like Bitly after you've added the UTM parameters to your URL. This way, you can maintain the clean look of your links while still tracking the source accurately. You wont lose info by shortening them. \n\n\r  \nWhen someone clicks on the Bitly link, they are redirected to your long URL with the UTM parameters. The UTM information is then sent to your Google Analytics.\r  \n\r  \nIn your Google Analytics, you can see exactly how many people came to your site from the Facebook link.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, the key is to add the UTM parameters before you shorten the URL. If you do it the other way around, you're right that the tracking will break.",

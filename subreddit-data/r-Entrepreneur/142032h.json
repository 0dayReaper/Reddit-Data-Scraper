    "postText": "I finally decided to shut down two businesses I had going. One for 3 years, one for over 15. I want to do something else with my life. I failed at both, and it's time to finally call it quits.\n\nFirst off, the more \"real\" business if you want, is my computer repair shop. I'm shutting it down. I'm not gonna do that anymore. I don't know if it's being in a small town, but at this point I'm just sick of losing my ass on Facebook ads that give me no customers &amp; google ads banned all 3rd party tech support services. \n\nThe company was, is, and always will be A FLOP. There is no way to save it. Luckily the commercial space is still mine, and I'm moving from repair to sales on Ebay &amp; Amazon via FBA. Turn the repair shop into a selling thing.\n\nThe other one, less \"real\", was my YouTube channels. The shit is dead. I've been banned so many times by YouTube for the stupidest shit and now I can't verify my ID anymore no matter what name I give. They don't want me on there, and the one thing that brought me a very nice chunk of side money was banned (aka to catch a predator update videos because they love pedos for some reason now.)\n\nTwitch was never a real business venture, it's too much grind. No real ROI. Too much luck based. Not gonna bother there.\n\nIt was a good run for both, but I'm just done. I'm gonna just focus on selling products on Ebay and writing my books for fun (since they don't sell for shit either at this point). Ebay was the only thing I ever did well at in all these business ventures.",

The YouTube thing just sunk like a rock once they started banning to catch a predator content like nothing else I did got anything. I went from getting like 10-15k views a day to maybe 50 if that. Having to start a brand new channel with 0 subs once a month sucks and I just think it's time to call it for good.\n\nHoping eBay won't get in the way of progress the way google &amp; youtube did.",

I\u2019ll never quit trying but atm I\u2019m doing sales in hvac while i stack up and think about what attempt 4 will be. If you built up a channel that was getting 10-15k views then you can for sure do it again, you got this! You just gotta drop that feeling of hopelessness which is soooo easy to embrace especially after a fresh failure. Reject it. And come back stronger.",

(If it still exists) Back from 2006-2010, I worked with a close friend who had an HVAC business to buy bulk lots of overstock and older model equipment to clear their warehouse floors and make room for new equipment. Along with this, we got a wholesaler account at places like Grainger, RE Michel, etc, and bought stupid things like attic vent fans, capacitors, consumables, etc. There is a ton of opportunity in the HVAC market, since homeowners typically can't buy the stuff themselves. \n\nI rented an 8,000 sqft warehouse and we stocked it up once a month from various supply house deals in our area and made BANK on those thing selling on eBay. (We bought 1,100 package units one time for $150 each, selling them for $2,500-$3k ea) In the end, we got greedy and started selling new products for very high margin, and eventually they big name brands (Carrier/Trane specifically) threatened to shut down his local business supply, so we shut it all down. \n\nBetween 2006-2010 however, we made more than $3m in profit with 2 people, a warehouse, forklift and tractor trailers full of old-stock being dropped off each month.",

It's the fact that YouTube is straight up AGAINST me at this point with this constant \"ur trying to ban evade\" when all i'm doing is making a new channel for a new topic to try to brand and grow... so then i gotta wait 2 fuckin months to be able to have all the tools I need. Even with all that it refuses to even show my content i make to new viewers. I must have pissed somebody off up there. Idk who tho.\n\nMaybe some pedo got offended at my TCAP videos and put me on a blacklist or some shit idk. Changing my name does nothing. They know my face somehow and always rejects my verifications on any channel.\n\nTLDR; YouTube hates me. I hate them, but there's nowhere else to go so i have to quit.",

Leadership (cockpit)\n2. Products (wings)\n3. Marketing (right engine)\n4. Sales (left engine)\n5. Cash flow (fuel tanks)\n6. Overhead &amp; operations (body)\n\nIf your plane is on the ground, you probably have a fuel or wings problem. If you\u2019re losing altitude, it could be  the engines, fuel tanks, or the body is too heavy. If you\u2019re off course, you may have a pilot issue. Sales and marketing make everything else go. \n\nI know these operations have failed, but you can consider this for future businesses.

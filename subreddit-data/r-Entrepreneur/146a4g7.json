    "postText": "Interview with Leslie Arbouin Vargas. Founder and CEO of QAHOLOM.\n\n**Tell me about QAHOLOM.**\n\nI had been thinking of becoming independent for many years. During this time, I was working in Multi-Latin and Multinational companies like Grupo Familia, Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, Ernest &amp; Young Consulting. The time came where I decided to take the giant leap forward with all the experience I had accumulated. I had the motivation to be a grain of sand in the country and help with employment opportunities for people and help bring my business idea to the country. I wanted to take advantage of the knowledge I had gained in IT and use that in a closer circle. In addition, the generations of today don\u2019t have as many obligations as we did when were growing up so I wanted to create an economic company where it could be maintained over time rather than risk of being replaced at any time. With all these factors and looking to start a new company in 2016, I decided to retire at my previous position to go after my business idea. Let me just say it\u2019s not easy to decide to leave everything and get out of your comfort zone to lose your monthly salary to pursue your business idea.\n\nAnyways, I left my previous company and dedicated myself to study for three months to create the business plan and business model. I\u2019ve always been very fond of information technology, of the importance of information and the potential that information has. That was my main vision during those three months. This was back in 2016 so remember that back then the terms of artificial intelligence, robotization, digital automation knowledge was still ethereal. I wanted to make those technologies that were already available in Colombia at that time, in companies like Bancolombia or Sura. The processes existed in these very large companies, and I wanted to be able to democratize that access to smaller companies. I began to see that many of these features are charged on demand. The development of the cloud came with great force, through the clouds of Amazon, Microsoft, Huawei. They had been implementing consumption by demand for interesting technology. I was quite interested in this so I decided to go more into the demand management path. After a long time thinking about this, I decided to start.\n\nI was following our company\u2019s phrase phrase: \u201cThe future isn\u2019t predicted, it is created\u201d, a phrase from Abraham Lincoln. And from so much thinking and saying \u201cWhere is this going to go? What am I going to do?\u201d In that moment it was very hard for me to understand where the technology was going. I said to myself, \u201cJust roll up your sleeves and start with what there is\u201d, and that\u2019s how I decided to start\u2026 without even knowing very well what I wanted to build. I was looking to manage complete automated business processes, and not get into the world of pure automation because I don't think pure automation has much value compared to an automated management process. Another pillar was the human value. We never justified a project by the number of people that are replaced, but by the scalability that can be given to the business through the way people work with the technologies. People start to change their mind and they start to change their professional profile and really enhance their value. We approach projects more from that point of view than from the replacement of human resources. \n\nWe began with our first client who believed in us and again, we didn\u2019t know what technology to use or how to build it. We slowly began to find the way. We kept looking back at the company phrase I mentioned earlier. It has to be this way, by doing and if not, there is no other way. From there we found the method, the form, how to sell. At first it was very difficult for people to understand me, what we wanted to do, it was even hard for me to explain it because I didn't know how to put it together very well either. Over time we were able to explain our services well. The Pandemic arrived and although it was scary for all of us, it was very important for us because there were more ears in terms of digital issues and it facilitated the entrance to the organizations. We started contracting people and thanks in large part to the pandemic, we never decided to open a brick-and-mortar office. Today, I have many employees that aren\u2019t in Medell\u00edn and are in different Colombian cities and countries. \n\nOur business is focused on offering the possibility to digitalize your workforce through a mix of technologies: Digitalization, cognitive learning, robotization, artificial intelligence, and visualization. We master digital work. What we do is we use a virtual machine, and we put it into the organization just like when a consultant arrives at a company. The company then gives me access for that computer so I can enter and access the tools with which the virtual machine needs to work internally, for example, e-mail and operating systems like SAP or Oracle, base applications like Microsoft 365, company databases. We also integrate our application so organizations can interact with the information because it\u2019s not just automation, it\u2019s managing the process from end to end. There will be points where users need to interact with the organizations. For example, \u201cGive me your opinion on this. Send me this form so I can include it on this billing process\u201d, so they work with the human teams. We charge under the SAS model. So, let's say for the companies, they don't need to erode their capex initially. They can charge as an operating expense and there are many, almost all of them already enter it as an operating expense. What do companies get? It allows companies to have complete control of the process, visualize processes that were previously invisible, as they weren\u2019t digitized, improve productivity, have the employees focus their attention on things they actually want to do. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the fear that employees will be replaced by machines, but what actually ends up happening is humans shift to the tasks that they actually enjoy. I\u2019ll give you an example, we worked with a client, Pintuco, and they had the same fears. We did a workshop with the employees and the boss, and we asked them what they needed in their jobs, what did they always ask their boss about, but the boss didn\u2019t have the human resources to approve that request? They told us that are always stuck in the computers instead of working with the vendors. The conversation got very interesting with the employees saying that they don\u2019t have time to talk to the vendors and clients. Now, they have an additional sales force that accompanies the customer, the vendors because the information needs to pivot back and forth from inventory to transportation. So after we came in, that team became an additional sales force, no one was let go. They\u2019re now able to sell better and sell more. \n\n**What inspired you to create QAHOLOM?**\n\nI don\u2019t think there was anything specific. It came out of many things, what you want from life, what you want to contribute society, what are you passionate about, what you want for your future. I can\u2019t pinpoint something specific, but I always was motivated to be an owner of a company. Since Uni I carried this motivation, and it was normal to have fears about starting it. I always think if a Uni graduate who wants to create a company like QAHOLOM, what would their journey be like? Well, honestly it would be almost impossible. The reason being that you\u2019re just a Uni graduate with no work experience and you\u2019re suddenly approaching CEOs of big companies and you\u2019re trying to sell how you\u2019re going to scale their business with technologies. It\u2019s going to be a hard road convincing them of all of that when you don\u2019t have experience. Anyways, I always had the vision of wanting to be an entrepreneur.\n\n**Tell me about what you do on a typical day. What do you do at your job?**\n\nEverything. Most importantly, I sell everyday. I call potential clients whether it\u2019s the first call or it\u2019s the second call, or to charge them. I have meetings with the team to know what they\u2019re doing. We use digital tools to be able to work wherever we are. We use tools that help us construct diagrams, models, and brainstorming because this is key in our area. I work with the accountant to look at the invoices, charges. I meet with partners who I\u2019ve had the pleasure of calling partners thanks to doing business with them. It starts when you are in a company, you are very involved in your topic. You meet many people with many interests, and you can see a possibility for business in other areas. I help develop ideas talking with people, small businesses who are just starting to grow. I\u2019m always working on everything!\n\n**What do you love about what you do?**\n\nI love seeing people grow, change, and improve. We have a focus on the education side too. We have two people in distant locations who we hope can use the tech we use. Right now, we are helping them in this educational process so that one day they can join the company or other companies within the same sector. That\u2019s a big focus for QAHOLOM, being able to help people grow professionally. In the company, I have people from Choc\u00f3, people from very humble backgrounds. We finance part of their educations; we help prepare them with technological knowledge. All of this is something I\u2019ve always been passionate about. It motivates me to grow more so I have more money to finance education for people who want to self-improve. \n\nAnother thing is being able to contribute to the economic employment here in Colombia, to be able to provide a formal employment to someone and give them a good salary. Transfrorming society even in the smallest circle that you are a part of \u2013 that\u2019s something that motivates me. Lastly, I love information at the professional level, how can one transform companies from the use of information technology?\n\nIt's funny, I\u2019ve had zero turnover since I started the company. There was one person who left on their own terms because he asked for a promotion, but I couldn\u2019t give him one at the time. The next day he came in and finished the company. This was three years ago, he had access to everything through the Cloud and deleted everything! So, when we woke up there was nothing. We were fortunate enough that Microsoft helped us from India and other countries, and we were able to recover a large part of our operations. Our clients understood what happened and waited for us. After two months, we were able to re-establish our full operations. I tell this story because it\u2019s like if you brought someone in to work for your factory and they light your factory on fire. After him, no one has left our company, everyone has been happy working at QAHOLOM. That\u2019s beautiful to me because I initially thought I was going to have high employee turnover, especially in the technology sector which is used to high turnover.\n\n**What\u2019s the hardest part about what you do?**\n\nThe hardest part is the most passionate part, maintaining the team and maintaining the self-development of the people. It takes time and effort to motivate them, stay present, see the work advance, maintain the discipline, maintain the methodology, etc. The people are the most beautiful part and the hardest part at the same time. The tech is hard but once you study it, you learn it, if the methodology is complex, you work on it in a disciplined form until you get it. People always have moving variables so it\u2019s the most challenging work.\n\n**Tell me about some plans QAHOLOM has for the near future.**\n\nWe want to become the biggest support labour force through digital technology. If someone wants something incredibly fast, we want to be able to train that algorithm to meet that demand. So the challenge right now is perhaps to increase the speed of training on algorithms and mediating the incorporation of new technologies. Today we\u2019ve incorporated Azure OpenAi and that\u2019s helped us improve our training speed significantly. Right now the goal is to take on the new challenges of technology and improve the training of the digital labour force.\n\nFull Interview: https://www.torremagazine.com/interviews/interview-with-leslie-arbouin-vargas-founder-and-ceo-of-qaholom",

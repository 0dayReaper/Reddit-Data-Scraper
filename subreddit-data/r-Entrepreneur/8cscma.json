It's not really a how-to type of thing but I enjoy listening to how people got their projects off the ground and I have picked up a fair few things from it.\n\n[Indie Hackers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/indie-hackers-podcast-how-developers-are-bootstrapping/id1206165808?mt=2)\n\nMainly interviews with tech businesses and apps and how they went about establishing their business, how they came up with their ideas and stuff like that.\n\n[Black Hearted](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/blackhearted/id1189773499?mt=2)\n\nInterviews with veterans who own successful business from a wide range of business types that mainly seem to be brick and mortar rather than digital.\n\n[Masters Of Scale](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/masters-of-scale-with-reid-hoffman/id1227971746?mt=2)\n\nI listen to it but I can't help but feel it is massively overrated. I also find it confusing at times as they randomly seem to just play ads for their other interviews for some reason. If you are listening to them in the order it often flashes back to an old interview and gets a little annoying.\n\n[From Scratch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/from-scratch-npr/id381100612?mt=2)\n\nAgain, she interviews CEO/MD types about their business. Features a fair few digital businesses but does have a few others mixed in.",

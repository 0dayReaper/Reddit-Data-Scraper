    "postText": "For the first few months I thought people were simply lying to me when they said they left a review.  I ended up back at a customer's house for an issue and she asked \"did you like our review?\".  I told her something must've gone wrong, it never showed up.  She opened her phone and showed me, on my Google business page, her five-star rating with a lengthy glowing review.   So I checked back with a few other customers who assured me they'd actually left a review, and sent me screenshots.  \n\nThese reviews aren't spam, it's not from scammers, they definitely don't violate guidelines or policy, there's no way they received too many reviews in a short amount of time.  The reviews are from actual customers who would like to give me recognition for my work.  The most frustrating part is Google seems to be shadow banning these people.  Google wants the customer to think their review has successfully gone through.  I'm a pool builder and don't get as many opportunities for reviews as other businesses.  I'm lucky to complete two projects a month, so every review is extremely important.  As I'm sure others know, communicating with Google is basically impossible.  Is there any way to resolve this?  Has anyone been able to contact and actual human at Google?  Any help is greatly appreciated.",

This will be based on signals. Perhaps one of those is geolocation of you. Everything is based on signals of a certain strength. \n\nWhen you install pools you will stay with the reviewer for weeks, at their home address. I'm only speculating that this might be taken as signal of a personal connection.",

Perhaps ask a question in the Google Business Profile Help Community, there should be someone with more experience there.",

Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit naive to think that people like that will respond to random messages from a stranger, or that they will spend their valuable time with you just because you offer them a free meal?\n\nYou\u2019ll need a very clear and profitable proposition, in writing, before they\u2019ll even acknowledge your existence. You need an elevator pitch that will generate enough interest to read a summary, a summary that\u2019s convincing enough to want read a plan, and a plan that\u2019s solid enough for them to want to allocate 10 minutes of their valuable time to listen to you personally.",

For them, I was actually goign to invite them to a power lunch or dinner and simply ask for them to reach out to thier freinds / former employers (a16z, etc.) and suggest a meetup",

The postcard or LI message is just your elevator pitch and should generate enough interest for them to want to read the summary, which is a 1A4 that highlights the keypoints. The A4 should be interesting enough for them to want to continue reading and flip through a multipage document that explains all the ins and outs of your business: the product, the market, the team, the financial projections, potential ROI, etc. And they\u2019ll want to see all of this before they\u2019ll even consider scheduling an appointment with you. \n\nSo, if you want to reach out online, provide a stellar elevator pitch and a link to a website with more info, where they\u2019ll land on the summary page, and can click through to all the rest of the info. And don\u2019t ask them to provide their details before they can access this info, as they won\u2019t do it and instead will just continue to ignore you.",

Brightside investors will send you your competitors. Your deck shouldn't be your codebase either it's something to wet the lips to ask you for a quick call. Now with Ai decks I imagine this inbox has only got worse!\n\nDue diligence really happens in the room and honestly get used to it 100 people will say they love you and never lead the round so desensitise to this bit. Start a newsletter in your space and collect 500 customers convert 50 to preorder customers and VCs will get in touch with you. They can't help but get excited over paying customers.",

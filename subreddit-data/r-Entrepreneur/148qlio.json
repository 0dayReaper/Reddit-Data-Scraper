If you're interested please DM me and I'll send you a promo code that will make it free.\n\nThe concept is simple: browse profiles, listen to samples, and if an entertainer strikes your fancy, you can buy time with her (free for anyone who wants to beta test)\n\nAll exchanges are done via audio recordings (no pics or video) that are emailed back and forth. Customers can choose from entertainers who will have explicit interactions or friendly platonic interactions.\n\nUltimately we hope to have lots of different free categories where regular people can interact and discuss various topics like sports, politics, etc. \n\nwww.theaudioexchange.net",

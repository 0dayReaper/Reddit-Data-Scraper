    "postText": "I\u2019ve grown a creative agency in Tallahassee fl pretty well. I generally only work 2-4 hours. A week on it and it pretty much runs itself, I have a account manager and a photographer. \n\nWe help our clients with social media management as well as create the content for them, as well as helping with organic marketing tactics to bring some more customers in the door. \n\nI\u2019ve pretty much exhausted the outreach in that area in my area and was looking for ways to book my photographer and videographer more. I found a way to get him booked on a retainer with a big local company and we decided to split up the editing process so we ended up doing a 50/50 deal. \n\nThis sparked my imagination to start getting him booked and taking over the editing to decrease the workload for him (as well as I enjoy editing) he\u2019s more of the creative of the duo and I\u2019m more of the marketing guy. It works perfecting so I had the idea of starting to do graduation photos. \n\nIt\u2019s a college town and there\u2019s a revolving door of seniors paying hundreds of dollars per shoot. For their photos. I believe my partner is the best in town so why couldn\u2019t we take over this sector?\n\nI genuinely feel it\u2019d be quite easily book 2-3 clients a week spanning in the $200-$300 range. With very little hours put into it I feel it\u2019d be worth the money for us on top of the clients we already have. \n\nLastly I moved to south Florida so I\u2019m looking to get another photographer down here and copy the model here. As well as have a connection in Maryland who will copy the model with me as well.\n\nHow can I keep this all organized and take it to the next level. I don\u2019t think we will have a problem getting clients seemingly that there\u2019s a abundance and our portfolio is killer. I feel we can make several thousand dollars off this but how can I get it to the 10k a month in revenue mark?",

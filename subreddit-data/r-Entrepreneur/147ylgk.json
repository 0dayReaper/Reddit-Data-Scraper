    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nI\u2019m curious to know everyone\u2019s thoughts on reselling, how sustainable is the business of reselling? Do you think a business that resells anything and everything would be more sustainable than a niche reselling business? Or is it better to focus on a few correlated items and just stick to flipping this way? Is reselling a business or more of a side hustle?",

            "comment": "I spent the 2000s reselling sneakers and made a small fortune. A lot of the guys I ran with back then are now millionaires. I kind of wished I had stayed in the game, but I lost my passion for it. Peopel seem to hate resellers, they think all resellers are cutting the line, making backroom deals, etc. I was just buying sneakers that were on sale that spent months sitting on shelves. A lot of resellers online just buy stuff on massive markdowns and sell them online.\n\nI like BJs wholesale club store brand dress shirts. I hate going to BJs in person because they only have certain styles in certain sizes, it's a pain in the ass. They do not sell shirts online for some reason. I found out you can buy pretty much any shirt they have ever made brand new on ebay for about half retail. It seems like a lot of people just buy the entire inventory when it goes 75-90% off and then resell on ebay. So for me, I pay less, I have more selection, I have more convenience. So maybe the internet hates PS5 resellers, but there are actually ones out there making everyone better off.  \n\n\nOne of the best reselling hustles I've seen is high end strollers and baby goods. I know a guy who makes a living buying high end strollers on the cheap on FB Marketplace, Craigslist, local moms groups, etc. you can get them cheap, then he relists them higher. if you're in a metro where no one is doing this it shoudl be easy to learn. IF someone is good luck learning to find strollers before they snatch them up.",

            "comment": "Personally I think it\u2019s a brilliant way to make money. You can niche yourself into stuff that you\u2019re really into, or do a general bit of everything. You can different stores for different types of things you sell, one for clothes, toys, etc. \n\nEither find stuff in good condition from motivated sellers which you can turn around with little effort, or you can buy busted things, fix them and then sell them. \n\nYou will develop some good interpersonal, business and trade skills (if you want) throughout the years, and these skills move with you as you can scale to larger items; cars, machinery, houses etc \n\nI know most probably despite Gary V but he is right when he says anyone can earn $100k a year just pumping garage sale finds on EBay.",

    "postText": "Hello Reddit! It took me a little bit to move forward with this post but what do I have to lose by simply asking? Not a thing, I could only gain something by doing so, someone once told me closed mouths don't get fed.\n\nHello, I am looking for a mentor who can provide guidance for starting and managing a successful business. It has been my dream since childhood, but after my father's suicide in 2018, I lost motivation and was in a dark place for sometime only existing simply hoping to make it through the day one day at a time. However, I don't want to let his death hold me back anymore, and I'm ready to start living my life again and I dont want one tragedy to prevent me from living the life i want.\n\n\n\nI would prefer a mentor who is located in Utah to allow for more direct interaction and possible face-to-face meetings. However, virtual mentorship is also acceptable. I believe that virtual communication only provides about 60% of the information and overall value compared to in-person conversations, even if they are infrequent. This is due to the lack of non-verbal communication cues. I would prefer to absorb as much knowledge from whoever  would be willing to share it and learn everything that I'm able to from someone instead of leaving half the wisdom I could garner from them on the table.\n\n\n\nComing from a family that is not very wealthy and with no history of entrepreneurship only employment, I have had little to no exposure to the world of business. This is why I am seeking a mentor - someone who can provide advice and guidance, share their experiences, and help me navigate the challenges that come with starting and running a business.\n\n\n\nI would like to learn everything from the basics of setting up a business to the more complex aspects of running and growing it successfully. As I said before, I want to start living my life again and am motivated and ready to put in the work necessary to make this endeavor a success, even if that means I have to fail many times before I am able to do so. By finding someone who is willing to mentor me, I am hoping to minimize the chances of multiple failures since much of what I have read on entrepreneurship has to do with perseverance. I am going into this expecting that I will fail at some point and not let it stop me. Currently, I have a full-time job and occasionally work on weekends because the company I work for is very busy at the moment. Therefore, scheduling may be difficult at first however, if I find the right mentor and have complete trust in them, I am willing to resign from my current job and pursue a full-time career as advised by them, when the time is right and they think I am ready. However, I refuse to leave the company I currently work for high and dry; they have done right by me, and they deserve the same in return, so I won't leave without them having found a replacement first.\n\n\n\nIf you are an experienced business owner or have significant experience in this field, and are willing to share your knowledge and insights, I would be extremely grateful. If you believe you can help me on my journey and are willing to do so, please let me know. I am a quick learner and consider myself intelligent, but at 27, I don't consider myself wise yet. As the saying goes, \"A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.\" \n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. I'd like to apologize if it was a bit much; I tried to remove anything I felt was not important or simply not needed. I look forward to potentially learning from one of you and your experiences.\n\n\n\n I am determined to see this through and make a success of it, no matter how many tries it takes or how long.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nT.J.

Edit: good luck to you\n\nStarting a junk removal business can be a great idea, as it requires relatively low upfront investment and can be a profitable venture. Here are a few suggestions to help you get started:\n\n1. **Understanding Your Capacity**: With your current setup, using an SUV and a trailer, you can handle smaller junk removal jobs like cleaning out garages, basements, and small home cleanouts. You'll likely need to upgrade to a larger truck if you want to handle larger jobs like whole house cleanouts.\n\n2. **Types of Junk**: Starting with general trash removal and clean-up services is a good idea. This can include furniture, electronics, appliances, yard waste, etc. Once you're comfortable with this, you can consider specializing in certain types of waste, such as construction debris or hazardous waste, though these may require special handling and permits.\n\n3. **Learning the Trade**: It's a good idea to start small and learn the ropes as you go. You could initially focus on residential clients before moving to commercial ones. Learn about disposal regulations in your area, figure out the best places to dispose of or recycle items, and understand how to price your services effectively.\n\n4. **Marketing and Customer Service**: Getting your business out there will be crucial. This could involve creating a website, using social media, and investing in local advertising. Equally important is providing great customer service. A strong reputation can lead to word-of-mouth referrals, which can be very beneficial.\n\n5. **Equipment and Expansion**: As you grow, you may need to invest in additional equipment or vehicles. Renting can be a good option initially, but as the business expands, it might make more sense to own.\n\n6. **Licensing and Insurance**: Check with your local and state authorities about any required licenses or permits for operating a junk removal business. You'll also want to have liability insurance to protect your business in case of accidents or damages.\n\nRemember that every business will face challenges. Being flexible, staying dedicated, and continuously learning will help you overcome them and succeed in the long term.\n\nStarting with a trailer can be a great idea, especially if you're looking to keep initial costs low. Here are some benefits and considerations:\n\n1. **Cost-Effective**: Trailers can be significantly cheaper than trucks, making them a good option when starting out. \n\n2. **Versatility**: Trailers can be used for a variety of junk removal tasks, from hauling household junk to yard waste and more.\n\n3. **Ease of Use**: If you already own an SUV that can pull a trailer, you're already halfway there. You can unhitch the trailer when it's not in use, which may be more convenient.\n\n4. **Volume**: Trailers can actually hold quite a lot, depending on the size you get. A 14-foot trailer, for instance, could be enough for many jobs.\n\n5. **License and Regulations**: Check local laws about trailer usage. There might be specific regulations or licenses needed for using a trailer for commercial purposes.\n\n6. **Maintenance and Safety**: Regular maintenance is important to keep your trailer in good shape. Make sure you're knowledgeable about trailer safety\u2014how to secure loads, how to maneuver while it's attached, etc.\n\nWhen you're just starting out, a trailer might be all you need. As your business grows, you can reconsider your vehicle needs and adjust accordingly.",

Shoot, a few landscapers I reached out to in my area turned me away since they already had too many clients. \n\nOne guy came out to give me an estimate on cutting back some shrubs and some overhang in the front yard...$450. I went out and got a decent hedge trimmer and did it myself in about an hour. \n\nThat's a hefty hourly rate I'd say.",

I will give a price on a deck, for example, and customers will say something along the lines of \"I could buy the material for less than half of that price and do it myself!\"\n\nOf course, they are right.  However, I am not in the business of re-selling lumber for little or no profit. \n\nYou have to understand that buying a trimmer and spending an hour in your own yard is not the same as this guy providing that service for you.  Even if the actual work only took an hour, he also has travel time to account for.  That means he was using a vehicle that he has to pay for, as well as the insurance and fuel costs.  Unlike you, he also has the added expense of licensing and business insurance to cover.  Also, where a DIY job for you has the benefit of being able to dispose of the waste for free, chances are he would have had to account for hauling it away and probably paying to dispose of it.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong with DIY to save a few bucks, but it is in no way comparable with hiring a professional to do it for you.",

We use BrightLocal to get all of our clients on the proper listing sites, but there are a lot of companies that offer similar services. The advantage to doing this is that you'll get listed on high authority (higher ranking) sites that will show your info for your category (as long as you make sure you're in the right one) in searches. For example, \"Primary care near me.\" \n\nAnd, these sites - because they've been around longer and he a high ranking score on Google - will show up before your website will. If you're not listed on them, you're missing a huge opportunity because your competitors most likely are.",

So, if I'm searching for \"Orlando Urgent Care Center,\" Google will show me the closest urgent care enters to me, which will be on the South East side. But, someone on the north side will see urgent care center closer to them.  \n\n\nIn rural areas, it works pretty much the same.   \n\n\nThat's one of the reasons local SEO is so important - both your GPB optimization and listing distribution. You want to make sure that you show up when folks are searching in your area.   \n\n\nOh! Also, since you're in the medical field, making sure you're listed on sites such as HealthGrades and ZocDoc is also super important. That's listing distribution again, but depending on the company you go through to help (like BrightLocal), they may only provide the larger sites like Yelp, BBB, Yellow Pages, etc\u2026 and not your industry-specific listing sites.   \n\n\nThe best way to find out where you need to be listed is to search for the terms you think folks are searching for to find you\u2026 and then see what pops up.   \n\n\nI just searched \"family docs near me\" and of course a bunch of GBP listings popped up, but HealthGrades and ZocDoc were next, followed by a few local docs that have high-ranking sites (lots of onsite SEO, good content, time on Google, etc.) and a few others that have paid ads.",

My first business was a parking lot striping company and all we did was go to parking lots create a quote and give it to the manager of the biggest store in the lot and ask for the owners number sold it after literally one summer at about 150k mostly just our customers was what they wanted all made on a rented parking lot striper and paint we got from sherwin Williams who gave a crazy discount because we were young. The owner of the huge pavement and striping company just impressed at the level of customers we had and offered to buy us out. I was already going to college so I coudn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to do it anyway so we sold. 2nd business was a residential cleaning business that turned commercial for student housing condos and that shit blew up we did 0 marketing and had people in the building asking about residential cleaning . Now I\u2019ve gone into the marketing agency modeling for service based businesses but people LOVE when I tell them my experience. Don\u2019t listen to these YouTubers telling you you need to make some SAAS to make 10k profit per month you could hit that easily doing driveway seal coating or window washing easily! Get a friend as a partner knock on tons of doors and just sell! Congrats man I love seeing people promoting shit like this here.",

I thought\u2026 maybe some business cards, get some insurance, hire a guy\u2026\n\nOne day I\u2019m trimming\u2026 and I barely touch an AC line on the units outside.  I mean barely touched it.  I also use .65 close to houses and fences.  Anyway\u2026 the line busted\u2026 called an AC guy, tells me the unit is old and needs a full replacement and feels really bad for me.\n\nSo\u2026. $6000 dollars later (got a great deal) \n\nI\u2019m back to full time working with computers. Sticking to what I know.  \n\nAll I\u2019m saying\u2026. Is watch out for liabilities.\nI told this story to another guy, he told me he was mowing one day and had a rock shoot out a window in a car.  Killed almost 2 months of work. \n\nSorry for the downer story.  It\u2019s not just cutting grass. I envy those guys that make it but shit happens.",

Then in the winter you need people to be on call without pay until there is enough snow to start the job and then work long days and nights in bitter cold conditions.",

    "postText": "Hey, Reddit!\n\nLaunching Octocom AI, a GPT-4 chatbot for ecommerce, we knew getting our first clients wasn't going to be easy. So, we decided to embrace the hustle of cold emailing.\n\nWe spent days crafting emails, always fine-tuning our pitch. It was tough but we kept pushing. However, despite all our efforts, the response rate was lower than we had hoped.\n\nThat's when we realized we needed a more compelling landing page. We rolled up our sleeves and gave [Octocom AI's](https://www.octocom.ai/) website a complete makeover. We aimed for a design that would resonate with our audience and clearly communicate our value proposition.\n\nAnd guess what? After launching the new landing page, our response rate soared. People started to engage more and we finally began to convert those cold emails into warm conversations and eventually, our very first clients.\n\nMoral of the story: a solid product (like our AI chatbot) and persistent outreach (through cold emailing) can get you far, but never underestimate the power of a well-designed website.",

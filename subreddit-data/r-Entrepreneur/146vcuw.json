    "postText": "Hello all, I\u2019m a fashion designer who has recently started to try and promote my work on instagram. I\u2019ve used the custom audience feature for the boosted posts, and for geographic locations I\u2019ve added almost every major progressive city around the globe, as these are generally where the creatives live that may be interested in my avant garde styles. \n\nHowever, according to the analytics my posts are being shown over 80% in Seoul, South Korea. This is only one city out of the roughly 40 that I have selected in the custom audience preferences. Every post I\u2019ve boosted has around this same ratio geographically. I am getting some pretty good engagement, however I\u2019d like for the ads to be distributed more evenly across the globe. What should I do?\n\nIf anyone has any tips or can explain why instagram is boosting my post in such a seemingly random area, it would be greatly appreciated!",

Someone else said it\u2019s because that is the cheapest place for them to use my ad spend. \nUltimately I think you\u2019re right though that I just need to set my target audience closer to USA",

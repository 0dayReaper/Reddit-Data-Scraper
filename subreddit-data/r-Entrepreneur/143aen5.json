    "postText": "I have become so frustrated with corporate America. Weather it be the false values they put out or the lies they sell to employees or the pledge that we are family but will fire you in a heartbeat \"to help the company\" while the bosses still collect thier $$$ bonuses. It's disgusting. As a result, I want to become a business owner. \n\nI will be reciving a large bonus soon and instead of using it to buy more liabilities, i want to buy a business with a manager in place. Just to give you a little of my background, i have worked in aeveral positions and know a lot about running businesses at least the strategic part. My goal is to find a business that has a manager in place to help me with the tactical portion of it. \n\nSo reddit, what's a good high cash flow business to buy that allows me to be somewhat hands off?",

Rule #1 of owning a business, you don't get hand holding; you have to figure it out yourself. Nobody is going to layout the foundation or the daily strategies for you.

It's a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n\\- Build genuine relationships. Be a giver, without expecting anything in return. This builds a ton of goodwill.\n\n\\- Test a lot of ideas to see what works and what doesn't. Then cut the ones that don't and double down on the ones that do.\n\n\\- Pick a niche. The more specific a problem you can solve for a specific group of people, the easier it is to sell your solution.\n\n\\- Have fun and enjoy the journey!",

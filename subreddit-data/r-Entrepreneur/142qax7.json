    "postText": "Hey everyone, I want to share the best way to coordinate a team. The solution is very simple - meetings.  \n1. Daily small 10-15 minute sync.  \n2. If we want to discuss something - set up a 30-minute meeting on a specific issue.  \n3. And for a brainstorming (long time consuming) meeting with a high level agenda and a duration of about 60 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are more than enough to cover 80% of coordination. Any ideas from your practical expereince?",

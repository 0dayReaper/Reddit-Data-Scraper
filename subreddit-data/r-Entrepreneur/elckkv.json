    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nLast month I realized anyone could pretty much find out who the biggest Shopify stores are since they're all hosted under the same IP: 23.227.38.32\n\nKnowing this, I scraped the Top 100 Shopify Stores by Alexa Rank, using myips.ms - so these are the most visited e-commerce stores using Shopify in the whole world:\n\n[Full list of the top 100 Shopify stores \\(Image\\)](https://imgur.com/GQ60XWl)\n\n(P.S: I transformed the Alexa rank into Estimated Monthly Traffic for easier understanding)\n\nNow, as for my findings:\n\n**1. Clothing is king, and the whole Fashion niche rules over everything.**\n\n[Full break-down of Niches \\(Image\\)\n](https://imgur.com/59PrUEI)\n\nOf the top 100 Shopify Stores, 29 had Clothing as their main niche.\n\nAdd Accessories, Footwear, Underwear plus Swimwear stores - which amount to 21 stores in total - and you have exactly **50% of the top 100 stores** belonging somewhere and somewhat in the Fashion niche.\n\nTaking a closer look, the biggest store currently on Shopify is Fashion Nova, which is a fashion company (well, *duh*) with over 21 million visits per month. Their traffic numbers are actually 3 times as large as their 2nd competitor (which is a makeup store).\n\nNow, this really is **The Mountain vs Oberyn** levels of competition.\n \nFashion Nova can essentially A/B test their landing pages and user experience until their conversion rates just blow away every competitor.\n\nAnd even then, this as a whole will benefit the entire Fashion niche - as they can simply ~~steal~~ *learn* from Fashion Nova UX choices and improve their own conversion rates for free.\n\nNo other niche has this much free information to be studied and replicated online.\n\n***Main takeaway:*** If you want to start a new e-commerce store or expand yours, a local needleworker can end up being more helpful than mindlessly browsing Ali-express.\n\n\n**2. You don't need to have Walmart prices to sell like Walmart.**\n\n[Full breakdown of the Best-sold Product prices \\(Image\\)](https://imgur.com/vhRiBSx)\n\nYes, some 29% of the Best-Sold Products on the list are under 25$, but 50% of the top stores have their Best-Sold product at a price point above 50$. \n\nWere you expecting this? I really wasn't.\n\nThis means big stores aren't obliged to do drop-shipping prices, even though some of these stores are (clearly) sourcing products for cheap in Asia.\n\n**Branding up and niching down** seems to be the absolute key here.\n\nAnd see it for yourself - go to any store from the list, and check if you can't identify their customer persona straight away.\n\nAll these stores have made the effort to laser-target their niche because that means they'll be the only ones able to satisfy it.\n\nFinally, having a larger margin per product is also one of the very few ways these stores get to increase their sales - because larger product margins will mean a larger advertising budget, which in the end will mean a larger number of customers reached.\n\nRemember that almost all of these stores survive and grow strictly through Facebook/Instagram ads - 93% of these 100 stores are using Facebook ads (trust me, I checked them one-by-one).\n\n***Main takeaway:*** Always focus on selling the benefit and not only product features, so you can brand yourself and distance your product from the common Youtube drop shipper.\n\n**3. Mobile Site Speed isn't a concern when you get a lot of traffic.**\n\n[Mobile Site Speed breakdown \\(Image\\)](https://imgur.com/tiqCG9T)\n\nSome of these stores are taking longer to load on mobile than Usain Bolt took to run 100 meters on the Olympics. \n\nIt's this bad.\n\nAnd because of this, it would seem that Site Speed doesn't affect nearly as much the sales or traffic numbers as one would predict.\n\nHowever, this a *misleading behavior* that you shouldn't replicate.\n\nYes, these stores still have their traffic and large sales numbers for sure - but Amazon found in an early e-commerce study that for every 100ms (meaning 1/10 of a second) of site delay, they *lost 1% of sales*. ([Source](https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/))\n\nMeaning many stores in this list could, in theory, **almost double their sales numbers**, by just working to decrease their site speed to regular values - and all this without ever having to increase their traffic numbers.\n\nThis is free money they're leaving on the table every month.\n\n***Main takeaway:*** Focus on having your e-commerce site speed low (especially mobile site speed), because unless you already have traffic in the hundreds of thousands and/or an established brand, your sales will tank (or never even takeoff).\n\nAnd that's it for today.\n\n*Now, you can check the full interactive database of my data [**here**](https://ecommerceranker.com/)* \u2b05\ufe0f\n*but it's okay if you don't because I'll keep posting more data-based insights right here.*\n\n*Thanks!*",

If the product wins, you have a winning product around the year.\n* **The unit price of products should be between $20 and $100**: Why is it an ideal price range? Because people can easily make a decision without much consideration.\n* **Small and easy to pack**: Small sizes come with low shipping costs. Shipping cost is always a thing when it comes to abandoned carts.\n* **Demand**: Yeah, do enough research to make sure there's actual demand for the product.\n* **People shouldn't be able to find the product locally**: Shipping time is the weak point of dropshipping.\n* **Stay away from saturated niches**: phone cases, dogs, bracelets, yoga accessories,...\n\nAlso, it's important to [use the right tools and research the right way](https://academy.pagefly.io/guide/how-to-find-the-perfect-product-niche-for-a-successful-print-on-demand-business/?utm_source=profile%3Areddit&amp;utm_medium=message&amp;utm_campaign=guides&amp;utm_content=dude) to avoid selecting niches based on the so-called 'assumption'.",

If they're doing this well with slow sites they could massively increase sales with proper site speed.     \n\n\nWhen I used to work at a site doing about 800M page views a month, I found increases of user traffic of about 10% off every 15ms I dropped the site speed down, and about 15% more organic traffic via google.   I had a lot of traffic to graph and play with, so these numbers were accurate.  Change out the CPU's to better CPU's, and this would immediately tick up with 15-30 minutes.   Find little bottle necks and push them out, and I could guarantee within that 15-30 minute window that numbers would improve.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if these guys are doing pages that slow, then it's really possible they're losing masses of traffic and sales.",

At that point, most stores transition to a headless implementation using the Shopify API, hosted on a cloud platform.  (i.e., Gatsby x AWS)\n\n[Tesla.com](https://Tesla.com) is one example that would beat out nearly everything on that list.\n\nThough I have no clue off the top of my head how to pragmatically figure out which sites are using that approach... *especially* if they're running their own middleware, and the public source code doesn't reference Shopify whatsoever.",

Otherwise you inevitably get a delay between publishing updates through your CMS until the site is built - you can mitigate this if you do incremental builds and yadda-yadda, but that's very complex I'm unsure whether an SSG is really worth the trouble in most cases.\n\n([This ecommerce site](https://www.shopflamingo.com) is built with Gatsby, it's dope and the performance is amazing, but it has a very limited and static catalogue)",

They sold well  for the first month but I soon fell into the common trap of adding more products to have more options for visitors. At first the profucts were all related but over time I moved from the niche to a more general category and by the time I decided to close shop my store was unrecognisable as a brand. In my rush to grow followers I also bought a few thousand followers which crushed my Instagram reach. My Facebook and Instagram campaigns were converting well in the beginning but as I added more products I kept on reducing prices. There's a thing with discounts. You can only give so much before breaking your business model. I had messed up so many things that I lost the motivation to go on with the same store or to rebrand it. I was in India back then. I've moved to England this year and I've booked my weekends with trade shows, business events and one on one meetings with founders. Hopefully, when I try e-commerce again, I'll grow enough to hold things together this time. I'm 25, so time is on my side I guess.",

A couple years ago I created a group for homebrewers and didn't spend much doing anything with it so it's \"dead\" now, but every time I log in I still have a bunch of requests from people to join.  The organic reach of just a regular post on your account is really incredible too.  I tested it out a couple months ago when sharing a piece of content, and I can't remember what kind of keywords or whatever I used but it got hundreds of views from strangers.\n\nInstagram is where I have spent the most time, and if I had the patience to stay with something I could grow a solid following (did it okay for a few weeks with a couple different accounts, but it didn't keep my attention).  With Instagram it's important to learn hashtags and have customer interaction.\n\nFor hashtags, you need to mix in both popular and niche hashtags, so you're appearing all over the place to new faces.  Short-tail vs. long-tail.  You might get a couple eyes from using a well-known hashtag, but you'll get more interested individuals and get their attention longer when you drill down into a specifically targeted hashtag.\n\nAs for customer interaction, the \"trick\" I used was to look for other people using the same kind of hashtags (actual people, not business or bots or anything), follow them, and like 3 of their recent pictures (and throw out a genuine comment, if possible).  Do that whenever you have downtime and you'll start getting people to follow back who are interested in what you have to offer.\n\nOf course, on both platforms you have to be offering something that helps others.  With your t-shirt example, just offering a product to buy might entice a small percentage of people, but if you build reasons for why someone should buy the t-shirt then you'll have a better conversion.  Things like blog posts about your topic and how your products help, or Instagram posts/stories about  the same thing, or start a discussion on LinkedIn or Facebook or Twitter.  Provide some kinda proof that you're knowledgeable about that thing.\n\nKinda rambley, but it's what I've figured out so far over the last maybe 5 years.",

I will tell you the facts of the matter as I see them. \n\nTo make that step from \u2018wantrepreneur\u2019 to actually being an \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 in reality, you cannot simply only be ambitious and aspirational whilst simultaneously unsure as to what you want to do, or not sure what you\u2019re passionate about. \n\nTo even just start a business (regardless of whether or not it will become successful in the long run), you do indeed have to know what you want to do (and if not initially, spend some time thinking on it and working that out). You also do indeed have to be passionate about something in life and, yes, I\u2019m afraid you MUST be at least proficiently skilled at something. \n\nA wantrepreneur without skills will never become an entrepreneur; you have to be really good at something\u2026.simply having ambition and being aspirational is not enough. You have to have a passion and be good at something. You have to have something to offer to a (potential) marketplace. \n\nYou can have all the ambition and aspiration in the world, but it isn\u2019t enough. You have to be passionate about and skilled in a particular field or at the very least competent at doing a particular thing. You have to be able to offer value in something you are passionate about and which drives you. Otherwise, you\u2019ll always just be a wantrepreneur. \n\nYou must surely have things or have something that you are at least interested in and/or good at, even if you don\u2019t have anything you\u2019d say you\u2019re \u201cpassionate\u201d about? What are those things/what is that thing? You are surely skilled at something? What are you skilled/good at doing? If the answer to all these is \u201cnothing\u201d, you\u2019ll never even get started as an entrepreneur. \n\nOn the other hand, if your answer is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, perhaps you need to spend some time thinking about things/working things out. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",

It felt like nothing I could do would ever take off and was not a great time for me.\n\nBut, I have some success now making a decent amount of money with my most recent business and it all came down to finding a community. I found this on Twitter where, unlike Reddit, people use their real names and share a bunch of stuff about how they were doing. There was [a newsletter](https://onbird.beehiiv.com/subscribe) that I found and then started emailing back and forth with the guy to understand what he was doing and he put me in a message group with a bunch of people similar to me.\n\nBeing alone in your business is super hard and alienating. Find other people that are doing similar things and share your successes and failures with them.",

And no doubt, everyone has their own answer.\n\nFor me, I was in a job I hated (making good money), mentally unstable (more so in a \"I don't like the way my life is going\" way) and came to a fork in the road. Quit and pursue what I thought was my passion, or accept that I will be mostly unhappy for the next 50 years. When putting it that way, it was an easy decision.\n\nMy passions were writing, sports, business, and stories. I had a start-up idea, which, as of 6 months ago, was an idea. Now, we have a team of 6 working on it, 600+ users on the waitlist, and launching our first release in 5 weeks. From that and those learnings, as well as the passion of sports and stories, I write [The Champions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe) \\- it gives me an outlet for creativity, and lets me apply learnings and networking from my start up.\n\nPassions change, and you have to allow them too. If you honestly don't know your passion, try things to find it. In this day and age, you can upskill really quickly, network at lightning speed, and take any opportunity that comes your way.\n\nGood luck! Would love to follow your journey",

Starting a business is not a prance through a meadow, capturing dollar bills with a little net as if they were butterflies. Wantrepreneur myths to the contrary.\n\n&gt;\u201cRunning a start-up is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss. After a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends\u201d.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--Elon Musk\n\nNot sure where the concept of business as some off-kilter form of self-help therapy ever came from, but I can't endorse it. Get your shit together, and then start a business. Business is not where you end a dysfunctional relationship with money, it's where you wind up spending money on all the wrong things, in the wrong proportion, and at the worst possible time.\n\nNobody wants to hear it. Somehow, they think a business will solve a dump truck full of issues and crippling personal problems. While a heresy, some people are simply not cut out for business. Others need to change drastically to make it in business, and working on yourself as you work on making a problematic hypothetical business into a functioning one is like working on your car as you speed down the highway. Difficult isn't nearly the right word for it.\n\nIn a time long gone now, a business book titled \"In Search of Excellence\" was a popular best seller. I can't think of a similar book grossing ten dollars if put out today; for it is contrary to all the reasons people blunder into business obliviously as a best practice now.\n\nIt's the reason you don't read posts with the phrase \"Work Smart, Not Hard\" here but hundreds advocating \"Just Do It.\" That includes the top comment in this discussion.",

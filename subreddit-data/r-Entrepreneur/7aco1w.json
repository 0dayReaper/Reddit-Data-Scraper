    "postText": "There are quite a few ways to make some extra cash online. If you follow this subreddit, you probably know that already.\n \nYou\u2019ve probably also noticed that one of the most challenging parts of online entrepreneurship is **finding the right niche.**\n \nLook around, and you\u2019ll find *tons* of information about how to do the whole \u201cmaking money online\u201d thing.\n \nWhether it\u2019s affiliate marketing, dropshipping, selling t-shirts, or whatever else, you\u2019ll find a wealth of step by step guides that can teach you just about everything you need to know about strategies that work.\n \nSure, there\u2019s a learning curve at play there. And it can get kind of overwhelming if you\u2019re new to all this stuff. But with some time, dedication, and perseverance, you can learn what you need to know to start making a profit as an internet entrepreneur.\n \nWhether your goal is to bring in some extra beer money with a fun, low-maintenance little side hustle, or to create something you can scale over time into a liveable, sustainable income, you can make it happen.\n \nBut you may have noticed something. Despite all the awesome free information out there, there\u2019s one thing that, at the end of the day, no one can really spoonfeed to you.\n \nAnd that\u2019s **finding a niche.**\n \nIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s really the tricky part. And it\u2019s a central aspect of a bunch of different kinds of online businesses.\n \nMaybe it\u2019s not universally applicable, per se, but niche selection is essential for such perennial /r/entrepreneur standbys as affiliate marketing, dropshipping on Shopify, creating monetizeable Instagram accounts, and more.\n \nIt\u2019s also important to what I do, which is Kindle publishing.\n \nI know there are other Reddit posts out there about finding a niche, not to mention a million blog posts on the subject.\n \nBut even so, I wanted to share my own \u201cin-the-trenches\u201d knowledge and experience because I noticed there\u2019s a lot of bad information online.\n\nI love this stuff. I remember when I was starting out spending hours upon hours throughout the night (and often saw the sun come up) researching different niches. \n \nAgain, my experience is with ebook publishing, but I\u2019m also talking about broader concepts that are applicable in other entrepreneurial pursuits.\n \nSo here\u2019s my advice on finding profitable niches. And it\u2019s maybe a little contrary from what you\u2019re used to hearing over and over again.\n \nSo let\u2019s get started.\n \n**This is a pretty long post, so here\u2019s a quick TL;DR of the key points.**\n \n* **Go for profit over passion.** Profit potential takes precedence over your own personal interest in a subject. Remember, you can always outsource your content and copy to someone who does know a lot about the topic.\n\n* **Go for big, evergreen mass market niches that always sell.** I\u2019ll explain why, and what these niches have in common.\n\n* **Focus on solving a specific problem.** \u201cGetting in shape\u201d is a broad niche. \u201cHow to get a six pack in 6 weeks or less\u201d is a *specific problem.*\n\nAutosuggest is one of the most efficient ways to pinpoint those specific problems. This applies on Amazon, as well as on Google and Youtube. You can also find tools like KeywordShitter and AnswerThePublic that make it easier to find and collate that information.\n \n#Should I Pick a Niche That Interests Me?\nThis is a pretty common question, and yes, I have been asked this by people quite a few times.\n \nAnd honestly, this is something that comes up periodically here at /r/entrepreneur, I\u2019ve noticed.\n \nThere are two pieces of advice you see a lot. And they\u2019re mutually contradictory.\n \nSome people will say, \u201cYes, go for your passion! You\u2019ll be miserable if you\u2019re grinding away writing content for a niche in which you have zero interest. Find what moves and drives you, and channel that passion. If you\u2019re into cars, do affiliate marketing for auto accessories. If you\u2019re into fashion, try finding a subniche in apparel and accessories.\u201d\n \nOthers say the opposite.\n \n\u201cNo matter how much you love something, when you create a business out of it, it\u2019s going to feel like work. And this could lead you to resent something you used to love. Don\u2019t make a business out of your passions or hobbies. Pick something toward which you\u2019re more neutral, but that you know is going to sell.\u201d\n \nSo which is it?\n \nBoth arguments honestly have some pretty good points.\n \n**Personally, I like to lean toward the second option: choosing a niche based on the bottom line, not on personal passion.**\n \nThat\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t choose a niche you\u2019re at least somewhat into. But here\u2019s why I\u2019m more in favor of Option 2:\n \n* **A lot of hobbies and interests are, frankly, kind of hard to commodify.** If you\u2019re into, say, French symbolist poetry, there\u2019s not a whole lot you can really do with that. At least, not at scale.\n\n* **With some things, commodification kind of \u201cfeels wrong.\u201d** Think spirituality, that kind of thing. This is pretty individually variable, though, and I\u2019m not here to make any value judgments of any kind.\n\n* **Chances are, you\u2019ll end up outsourcing most of the \u201cgrunt work\u201d anyway.** A quick look through /r/juststart confirms that when getting started, most people write their own content. But as someone who\u2019s published tons of books and stuff, I\u2019ll say this: no matter how much you enjoy writing, doing it all day, every day, in high quantities, burns you out like nothing else.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a super gifted writer -- a professional writer, even -- you\u2019ll reach a point where you\u2019ll want to outsource that kind of thing.\n\nWhy? Because if you\u2019re doing all the work yourself, you will reach a point where you can\u2019t scale anymore.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say your output is 1 book per month. And after a few months, I guarantee you\u2019ll want to take a break to recharge.\n\nBut if you are outsourcing your work, you can get 3, 5, 10 books done PER month.\n\n(Again, my experience is in Kindle publishing, so I\u2019m talking mostly about content, info products, etc. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll apply to physical products, creating an app, etc.)\n\n**At the end of the day, the goal here is to start a business and make money.** For that reason, it makes a whole lot of sense to focus on profitability, the level of competition, the potential for a \u201cfirst mover\u201d advantage in a nascent market, and other things like that.\n \nAgain, you might have a hobby or a passion that actually does lend itself well to starting a business of some kind. Selling products, writing a series of books about it, blogging about it and posting product reviews with affiliate links, whatever.\n \nBut don\u2019t feel like you have to start with your own interests. If you don\u2019t HATE it or if it does not go against your values, then it\u2019s fine. (But NEVER go against your values because you\u2019ll end up sabotaging yourself. For instance, I will not promote a business that is related to drugs, violence, or porn no matter how much potential there is because I will not feel good about doing it and I end up sabotaging myself.)\n \nNot interested in learning about knee high and thigh high boots tailored for the thicker calves of plus size women, even though there\u2019s a rapidly growing market for that kind of thing?\n \nFind a writer who\u2019s a plus size woman who loves fashion and wears a lot of boots during the winter. Get her to write up your product reviews, or write up general supporting blog content like fall fashion style guides and editorials about body positivity.\n \nShe\u2019ll gladly write for you. And no offense, but she\u2019ll end up doing a heck of a better job than you, because it\u2019s what she loves.\n \nAnd, what you end up paying her is a tiny fraction of the amount of money you\u2019re ultimately going to make from that content. [Check out my post about what kind of freelancers to avoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/79ok2p/over_the_years_ive_hired_over_a_hundred_freelance/) to save yourself a lot of headache, though.\n \nThere\u2019s a lot you can outsource, and for a lot less money than you might think. So don\u2019t toss an idea just because it\u2019s not a personal interest of yours.\n \nThe advice I give to my students is: get some stable, consistent cashflow going first, then you can focus on your passions.\n \nYou\u2019ll enjoy these passions a thousand times more if you do this because there\u2019s no pressure to make a profit from it. You\u2019ll be way more creative also.\n \n#Do I Need to Be Knowledgeable About My Niche?\n\nI kind of touched on this one in the previous section.\n \nIt probably depends on what kind of business you\u2019re running, what your goals are, and other variables that can be different from person to person.\n \nBut what I do want to emphasize here is that **you *don\u2019t* have to feel like you need to be a world class expert on a subject to build a business around it.**\n \nDon\u2019t let yourself succumb to the whole \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d thing. You\u2019d be surprised what you can do with some simple Googling in your free time.\n \nWe live in a freaking golden age of information right now. Thanks to the internet and smartphones, *you are literally holding the entire wealth of human knowledge in the palm of your hand.*\n \nWith just some determination, some free time, and the magic of Google Search, you can quickly learn the basics about almost anything.\n \nAnd honestly, the basics are all you\u2019ll really need.\n \nWhen it comes to content -- whether it\u2019s a book you\u2019re selling, or a blog post housing affiliate links -- what matters is that you know more than your audience about how to solve their problem.\n \nSomeone needs to attach two pieces of wood together with a nail? You don\u2019t have to be a world class authority on hammers to give them the answers they need. You don\u2019t need to know about the rich history of hammers, or how hammers are manufactured. You don\u2019t even need to be all that knowledgeable about building and construction in general.\n \nYou just need to know that your audience needs a hammer.\n \nAnd oh, look, you have a bunch of great product reviews of the very best hammers for their specific kind of nail. Or, you\u2019ve got a comprehensive ebook that gives a full step by step guide to hammers and how to use them to pound a nail.\n \n**So don\u2019t feel like you need to be a #1 authority or expert on your chosen niche.**\n \n#How to Find a Niche: Start with the Timeless Evergreen Niches That Always, Always Sell\nWhen people talk about niche selection, they put the biggest emphasis on specificity. They focus on narrowing things down.\n \nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. That\u2019s definitely something you should do. But that step comes later.\n \nBefore you begin, you want to focus on \u201cselling what sells\u201d.\n \nThere are big, massive, evergreen niches where there will always, always be a market full of people itching to break out their pocketbook and pay you for solutions to their problems.\n \nNow, these niches have some pretty important things in common. And I think it\u2019s worth talking about those things.\n \nWhat is it about these things that make them so perennially profitable?\n \n**It comes down to basic human desires. Love, sensory pleasures, material wealth, self-confidence, social success, self-actualization. These desires are basically universal, at least within contemporary Western culture.**\n \nThey revolve around things that people want on a very deep and fundamental level, in ways they\u2019re not necessarily even fully aware of.\n \n**Love and friendship.** For the most part, humans want to find a romantic partner with whom they can share both emotional and sexual intimacy. Someone to love them and support them.\n \n**Social success**. People want others to like them. This ties into things like beauty and getting in shape, although that also relates to the desire to find a mate. It also ties into self-help topics, like how to be more confident, how to get better at public speaking, etc.\n \n**Material wealth**. Good old \u201chow to make money.\u201d Whether it\u2019s investing in real estate, starting a small business, or whatever, people are always looking for ways to make more money. Again, this also ties into the concept of social success.\n \n**Entertainment.** People like to have fun. They like humor. They like to laugh. They like to read about celebrities or whatever, vicariously reveling in the sumptuous glamour and sexy scandals of the rich and famous. A lot of late 20th century sociologists and thinkers wrote about the concept of the \u201cculture industry.\u201d Think of that kind of thing.\n \n**Self-actualization and personal fulfillment**. People want to feel content in their lives. They want to find a sense of peace with the immanent reality of their own existence. They want to find ways to create meaning and infuse their lives with a sense of purpose that makes them feel complete.\n \nAs I mentioned, there might be some cultural variance here. I am not a psychologist, nor am I a sociologist, nor am I an anthropologist or a historian. Someone more knowledgeable on these subjects might be able to weigh in here.\n \n**So, here\u2019s a list of the specific \u201cmass market evergreen niches\u201d I\u2019m referring to. Each of them ties into at least one of the general human desires I was talking about above.**\n \n* **Mass media.** Celebrity bios, stuff about TV shows or entertainment history, that kind of thing. Also \u201cgeek stuff,\u201d pop culture stuff, etc. Think \u201cpop culture,\u201d which kind of runs the gamut from trashy tabloids, to comic book and TV show fandoms, and everything in between. Everyone partakes of the mass media culture industry. There are radically different audiences within it -- from blue collar housewives who devour the latest from TMZ, to sophisticated urbanites with a refined appreciation of contemporary interior design and decor, to people who are geeks and proud of it, guys who play D&amp;D or have an encyclopedic knowledge of Star Wars trivia. Sports stuff is in this category, too. Even fashion fits here.\n \n* **Diet and weight loss.** This is America. We\u2019ve got a massive obesity epidemic going on. We\u2019re constantly surrounded by foods that are bursting with calories, but that aren\u2019t very filling. (Seriously, take a look at the nutrition facts on those little cans of Coke and stuff. It\u2019s insane.) People are always trying to lose weight -- and unfortunately, in most cases, failing at it. It can take some time to find a regimen that works for their personal tastes and their lifestyle.\n \n* **Fitness.** Another thing people want is to get fit and get in shape. This one pairs well with weight loss and dieting, but it\u2019s really its own distinct niche. Getting fit doesn\u2019t always mean losing weight.\n \n* **Self development.** Self-help books are always a perennial bestseller. One of the most important things we need to do in this life is to understand ourselves, and sometimes even better ourselves. I mean, think about it. None of us chose to be here, and if we did, we don\u2019t remember it. We\u2019re thrust into this world, as conscious beings capable of joy as well as suffering, facing down the eternal coldness of the hard problem of consciousness. People look for ways to infuse their lives with meaning and a sense of purpose. They look for a compass to guide them through life\u2019s confusing twists and turns.\n \n* **Cooking.** Everybody eats food. Some more, others less. So cooking is another perennial niche you can consider. Cookbooks sell like crazy, believe it or not.\n \n* **Dating and relationships.** Finding a romantic partner is another big part of human life, at least for the majority of people. There are also the many problems of long term relationships and marriage -- dealing with disagreements, keeping sex interesting after multiple decades, rekindling romance in the wake of an empty nest, etc.\n \n* **Gaming.** This one\u2019s maybe a little more recent and modern than the others, but it really is a golden niche. I guess you could really stick this into the \u201cmass media entertainment\u201d category, but I thought it deserved a mention on its own.\n \n* **Making money.** Everyone wants to find ways to bring in some extra cash. Money doesn\u2019t buy happiness by any means, but what it *can* do is secure the base of the Maslow Pyramid. And that\u2019s really important.\n \nThere are more to this list. But what\u2019s important here is what these niches have in common: an appeal to basic, deep-seated, universal human desires for things like love, acceptance, wealth, and meaning.\n \nSo these things are evergreen. There is always money to be made. You might be thinking, \u201cAren\u2019t these super saturated and high competition?\u201d\n \nSometimes, but they\u2019re also massive and broad. There\u2019s plenty of room in these markets.\n \n#The Key to \u201cNiching Down\u201d\nYou might not actually need to narrow your niche down as much as people seem to think you do. After all, go too niche, and you\u2019re faced with a limited market. Sure, you might make some money, but you\u2019ll hit a ceiling.\n \nAnyway, **the key to pinpointing a subniche is to focus on answering a specific question or solving a specific problem.**\n \n\u201cHow do I lose weight?\u201d is a big thing, but it\u2019s not necessarily super specific. There are a lot of ways to lose weight. There are also a lot of reasons for losing weight, and a lot of different subsections of the population of \u201cpeople who want to lose weight.\u201d\n \nYou\u2019ve got people who are morbidly obese, whose very lives may depend on dropping the extra adipose tissue that\u2019s slowly destroying their bodies.\n \nBut then, you\u2019ve got, say, women in their 30s who aren\u2019t obese, but who want to lose a few pounds. Like, 25 lbs or less. It\u2019s not a health issue for them, so much as an issue of beauty, confidence, and sex appeal.\n \nThe way each of those groups goes about losing weight is going to be different. Their specific problems are different, and they\u2019re looking for different things.\n \nSo let\u2019s say you want to write an ebook and sell it on Amazon Kindle. You\u2019ve got weight loss in mind as the topic. Cool.\n \nNow, you need a specific problem.\n \n#The Power of Autocomplete: Finding the Exact Questions Your Audience Is Asking\nSo what\u2019s an example of a specific problem? And how do you go about looking for them?\n \nYou can find them by doing some keyword research. It\u2019s not just for SEO -- it\u2019s also a way to get a peek into what your audience is thinking.\n \nIn my case, the focus is on what people search for on Amazon. These days, when people want to buy something -- whether it\u2019s a product or a book on a subject -- they\u2019ll usually go to Amazon directly, rather than using Google.\n \nBut in other businesses, Google or even YouTube might be where you want to focus.\n \nWhether it\u2019s on Amazon or Google, you can learn a lot about what people are asking and where the demand is at by checking out what comes up with the autocomplete feature.\n \nYou can also check out resources like AnswerThePublic.com to find these questions, or use a tool like KeywordShitter or Keyword.io. The latter two actually draw from Google\u2019s Autosuggest feature, so it\u2019s a quicker way of getting that info than doing it manually.\n \nEither way, you\u2019ll find queries and searches like these, which are what you want to focus on.\n \n\u201cHow To Lose Weight Without Diet And Exercise?\u201d\n\u201cHow To Draw For Kids\u201d\n\u201cHow To Lose Weight Journal\u201d\n\u201cHow To Cure A Migraine\u201d\n \nSometimes they\u2019re actually phrased in question format, and sometimes they\u2019re not but you get the picture.\n \nHone in on these specific questions and searches. Then, offer your audience a specific answer.\n \nWhether you\u2019re putting together a buying guide for protein shakes or you\u2019re writing a series of ebooks about weight loss and getting in shape, **you can maximize your profits by offering a specific solution to a specific problem.**\n \n#This is what\u2019s worked for me over the years: BIG Evergreen Niche --&gt; Specific Problem Within That Niche\nI\u2019m not the only person offering this advice, or at least I don\u2019t think I am. But, it works.\n \nI realize that this subreddit is pretty diverse. Not all of us sell ebooks, or create monetized content. There are people here with cleaning services, with restaurants and bars, with brick and mortar boutiques, and more.\n \nSo my advice might not be applicable in every single case. But if you want to make some extra cash online, in a way that revolves around informational content, this strategy has worked time and time again.\n \nI do hope this was helpful to some of you guys out there. Let me know if you\u2019ve got any further questions about this stuff. \n \n---------------\n\nUPDATED: I've been getting tons of requests if they can get a PDF file of this post. My answer: Yes. \nJust PM me and I'll shoot it over to you!\n\n",

            "comment": "Awesome post! I love that you touched on the psych and sociology underlying a lot of what's profitable. (I'm a massive nerd, and I've been cracking out on the academic marketing literature over the last few months. I've amassed a huge collection at this point, thanks to the magic of Google Scholar.)\n\nWhile you don't have to have a PhD. in psychology or sociology to be a marketer and do well at it, I genuinely believe that there's a lot of value in cultivating a deep, intuitive understanding of human wants and needs.\n\nThere's value in understanding \"how people tick.\" That is *not* to say you should use this knowledge to manipulate or deceive people. A strong understanding of those things arguably puts you in a position of power, and that power should be used in a way that's socially constructive.\n\nThis is kind of only tangentially related to the kind of stuff OP is talking about, but [Chapter 2 in this book, \"Postmodern Marketing,\" is super interesting.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34142227/199.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1509647965&amp;Signature=YDzT6HtfJAVgZbQsC1H2nydnagg%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Marketing_Book_Sixth_Edition.pdf#page=58) (Warning: the intersection of postmodernism and 20th-21st century marketing is a major rabbit hole. I am not responsible for lost productivity as a result of said rabbit hole.)\n\n**But anyway, back to what OP is actually saying.** (I just wanted an excuse to share that paper, so w/e.) \n\nWhat I kind of wanted to say here was that **while it does help to hire a writer who's at least interested in your niche and somewhat knowledgeable, you don't need a true expert.**\n\nThis can depend on your niche. The plus size fashion example OP gave was a good example of something where you can find a writer who's pretty knowledgeable, has firsthand experience, etc.\n\nBut let's say your niche is something medical, or mental health related, something like that.\n\nYou're not going to get an actual physician or nurse practitioner to write for you. Not at the kind of rates you're probably going to be paying. (It is neither profitable or necessary to pay enough for content to make it worthwhile for someone with a six figure salary.)\n\n***But that's okay.*** You don't need a practicing physician to write about, say, lifestyle changes that can help someone manage their hypertension.\n\nJust make sure your writer has done health content before, or can demonstrate that they can with a paid trial project or something.\n\nAs someone who's written more than my share of cheap, mediocre content, let me tell you something: 99.9% of the content out there, even from \"authority sites,\" is cobbled together from a few cursory Google searches by people who have no idea what they're talking about.\n\nI happen to know from experience that those marketing and online business blogs people love, the ones you've heard of, are written in this exact manner. Blog posts about \"The Ultimate Guide to SEO in 2018\" are basically invariably written by people who have never even *practiced* SEO.\n\n**The bottom line here is that you don't really need to actually know what you're talking about to write basic content for a mass market audience, on just about any subject.** You can patch together a pastiche from what other people have already written.\n\nSo tl;dr, don't worry *too* much about finding a writer with niche expertise.",

That's why we're talking about putting it out there - to gain readership and ultimately turn that into profitability.\n\nSo please everyone here, for the love of God, if you don't know what you're talking about in healthcare just sell the women's boots and stay out of \"supplements\", \"vitamins\", \"treatments\", or specific to my field - magic exercises to 'cure' your need for glasses.\n\nBecause sometimes, you make a profit because someone really, really thought your product was going to fix their medical condition and you *kind of led them to believe it would* with that BS article you posted.  Then they see me, and they've spent a lot of money trying to avoid going to the doctor and don't have enough left over to spend on what might actually help them.\n\n\nSorry to rant, but I just really wanted to temper the conversation when it comes to making money in some niches.

            "comment": "Great post, but don't agree with not following your passion. I think it's important to do something you absolutely love and can talk about all day--because people buy WHY you do it. Your passion radiates and is contagious when selling whatever it is you sell; whether it's your personal brand in the form of content, a product, or service...people BUY YOU. Sure you can be fake and get people to fall for it, but that's short term thinking...create a brand (YOU) that people can buy and think long term, almost marathons rather than short sprints. You like talking about turtles? fucken talk about turtles. You absolutely love flowers? talk about every type of flower. Do what you love and not for the bottom line---because in the end, why do something you absolutely don't love? you're creating a brand because more than likely you're sick and tired of working for someone else, why create something you're miserable in? There are 3 ways to communicate: written, video, and voice aka blogs/articles, youtube videos like Vlogs etc and lastly, podcasts. I would focus on ALL 3 because people communicate in different ways, why not make it easy for them to understand in the way that they better understand your content? Not everyone learns the same way or processes information the same way. Next, look into the different platforms. Don't just grab a video or a picture and publish it in every platform you can think of and think to yourself it's going to be successful. Instagram attention is much shorter than say Youtube. 60-90 second videos work best on Facebook where 15-30s can work best on Instagram and 3m+ videos and how-to videos etc do well on YouTube. How do you hit all 3? written, voice, and video? simple. Write an article or blog in a TOPIC YOU LOVE. Pick out the key points and create a short video on it, this can be a slideshow of pictures and texts. For voice, read over your article using the application Anchor and record yourself reading the article. This is just one way of delivering triple threat. ",

Also, optimizing for search keywords on Amazon. ",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm in the UK, and I was chatting to someone the other day, about Costco and how you can use a phone app to scan products, to see if they have viable products to sell, and they said they saw something very similar recently on a Netflix documentary. \n\nBut I can't find which one. It's possible it only showed such a scene for a few seconds. And I can't ask them now as I did not get their details. \n\nDoes anyone know which uk Netflix show it is? \n\nThanks ",

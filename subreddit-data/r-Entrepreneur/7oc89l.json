The relevant part:\n\n\"Bob Ross, beloved, afro-rockin', godfather of painting instructions and happy accidents, was never paid a nickel for his legendary show. He did each and every one for free. The show was created to promote his company's painting supplies.\"\n\nMade me realize what level of work / detail / value I need to put into my own content marketing. Anyway, thought it was interesting.",

Designs (before Hobby Lobby), and they just flew off the shelves.\n\n",

But his art doesn't inspire independence and creativity to the degree that it should.\n\nHe's the king of the paint-alongs. \n\nThis has been translated into drink wine and paint businesses across the country. Have you seen them? It's fun but when I went all of the successes of my painting were in not following what the instructor and everyone else was doing.\n\n(Funny, all you need is a storefront, fill it with paintings, use acrylic not oil paint, and encourage your patrons to bring their own wine.  Another cool thing is it's like having a party, so all of the jokey fun event stuff applies: costumes, rotating decorations, promos, corporate events. I've seen businesses like this flourish. And there are a ton of great starving artists to teach at minimum wage everywhere now because of college loans.)\n\n\n",

Consider two options:\n&gt; \n&gt; **Option A:** an economy where advertising is unnecessary because there are limited product choices, no competition either at the retailer or manufacturer level, and a tiny consumer class able to buy the goods in the market.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Option B:** an economy overrun by advertising, much of which creates false distinctions between products, manipulates consumer preferences, creates consumerist anxieties about their perceived deficiencies, and increases consumers\u2019 costs for the branded goods.  At the same time, it has a robust competitive market with a wide range of high-quality goods at attractive prices, where advertising informs consumers of new product offerings and features and helps competitors differentiate between marketplace offerings so that consumers can find what they\u2019re looking for and determine their reservation price accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; I imagine many consumers would prefer a hypothetical option C, where consumer get all of the benefits of a fiercely competitive market without the \u201ccosts\u201d of ubiquitous and sometimes-manipulative advertising.  But option C may be oxymoronic; one possibility is that advertising is a precondition to fierce competition. ",

    "postText": "\nHello Entrepreneurs,\n\nI would like to ask regarding the hiring process of \"remote\" Operations people in new/mid sized entrepreneurial ventures. Like there are plenty of places that advertise/hire people with tech or creative (Visual Communication Design) backgrounds.\n\nHowever, I don't find any place that has information about or a database of talent in the Operations domain, which I believe could be very important for any business.\n\nI'm an operations guy with 12+ years of experience, having an entrepreneurial mindset and looking for the same. Please guide.\n\nLet me know if this post is against any rules as I'm new to this sub.",

                    "comment": "I'll try by giving an example of a recent experience, without being too specific.\n\nThe need:\nIt stems from the fact that just for my knowledge and experience, I asked permission for and analyzed a product based software company. The company was small/mid sized (~150 employees). \n\nTo my surprise, what I found was that they had a strong CTO and well balanced tech teams working under him. (Frontend, Backend, Database, API, Architects, Security, DevOps etc)\n\nThen there was a Director of Design managing all the UI, UX etc and other/external design aspects as well.\n\nThe Marketing and Sales team were performing their roles as well.\n\nThe CEO was looking after multiple startups, so didn't have too much time for this specific product. Upon digging deep, I realized that multiple teams working on the same pipeline had different interpretations of the same processes, resulting in unpredictable results (in edge cases) for the clients. \n\nI felt that they direly needed an Operations team / dept to streamline processes, policies, documentations, so that different teams wouldn't be working in hard silos. Even if they would, they would at least have someone looking after the product in a holistic manner.\n\nComing back to your question, I do not think any client would just wake up and hire unspecified operations. I was more on the aspect that generally the operations side is overlooked, without realizing the importance and impact that a good operations team brings. An Ops team isn't unspecified. Human understanding, process formation etc is almost similar across industries, if you view it from a higher level.\n\nYour last question; I believe at the start of a project and up-to a certain extent, till the time proper departments/teams are formed, an Operations team is of absolute necessity, as it would look after every aspect (broadly speaking) and form strong processes and pipelines, which would render the up-sizing of the company to be much easier and robust overall. An ideal operations team doesn't stay limited to a department within the company (at least in the initial phase of growing).\n\nEven after a company has created a strong foothold and grown to mid/large size, Ops are extremely important for ideal functioning of the company. \n\nThe answer to what I can provide for a project would be a direct advertisement of myself I believe (which I guess isn't the purpose of this sub). But should someone approach me, I can let him/her/them know about the details.\n\nAll this is what led to my question, why don't startups / mid sized companies opt for strong Ops teams.",

But I understand your point.\n\nAt the same time, I believe it would depend on the client and the problems they are facing. While it might take convincing for some, others would readily be all ears (due to facing problems in the same area/of the same type).",

What are some tools for a easy to tweak financial report?  \n\n\nHey all, We're finally looking at actually pushing our small start up  to a larger scale full time model.\n\nI'm in the process of writing a business plan for myself to ask the deeper market questions and get answers - and I'm looking to also write one for potential presentation to partnerships/funding/just to better show to family and friends as well.\n\nSo far I'm including the following elements:  \nExecutive Summary  \nProducts &amp; Services  \nTarget Market Competition  \nMarketing &amp; Sales  \nOperations  \nMilestones &amp; Metrics  \nCompany Overview &amp; Team  \nFinancial Plan  \n\n\nI'm trying to be as inclusive as possible but I'm hoping someone on here will have a source for what guidelines/formatting to follow for each type of plan as well as any free tools or hey even a paid one worth it would be considered. I'm also looking for financial plan excel templates or better showing ones that won't  take a week to fiddle with to get to report out decently.  \n\n\nThanks for any advice!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I had one a long long time ago that I found just randomly typing business plan and filetype:pdf. Then just scrolled through until I found something easy enough to follow and adapt for my business. It even had a excel spreadsheet for valuation and business expenses.",

    "postText": "I spoke with someone on Linkedin and talked about how this summer I wasn't able to land a swe or pm internship this summer, but he mentioned many startups would likely be willing to have you shadow/complete some work for them, which would be worthwhile to look into.  \nThis interested me because I've always been interested in startups, and I thought it could potentially be a really good learning experience. However, I'm unsure about where I can find tech startups to email. What are some good resources to look into?",

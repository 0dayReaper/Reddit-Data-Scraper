(It solves a problem that I'm struggling with which is high cost of doing nails in the City and time spent waiting for your turn at the nail shop)\n\nMy questions;  \n1) whats the best way to generate a memorable name for my brand?\n\n2) where do I get a list of potential customers emails or  people who have interest in nail product - so I can generate pre-sales to build momentum for the product.\n\n3) if you've build a similar product (or brand) what advise do you have for a newbie ?",

            "comment": "What do you mean by nail enhancement product? \n\nI happen to know a lot about the nail industry. Are you talking about a gel kit or a dip powder kit?\n\nPersonally, I think you should go with a name that shows character - sass, maybe a bit of cute but not too much, show some personality (for example \u2018NailBoo\u2019 is the dominant player right now, and I love their name). \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to get an easy email list that you\u2019ll be able to send everyone an email to get your business started unless you\u2019re willing to work with people and offer them value. I could see a scenario that you could make a deal with an existing business if you give them some percent of your initial sales that come from the email blast. But you would need to offer them a heavy percentage and prove yourself. It might just come down to convincing the right person though I know it\u2019s possible.\n\nPersonally, I think you should document the journey on TikTok and ask people to help come up with a name, help come up with the first colors that will drop, etc.. just go to the tiktok audience and bring them along with you. Brand new account with zero followers, that\u2019s fine. Most people when they\u2019re first starting a biz are embarrassed of being newbies, but it\u2019s the only interesting thing about you right now \u2013 the fact that you\u2019re new. I hate to be blunt, but it\u2019s true ..if you want people to care, the only thing that you have is the exact story that you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t try to fake it, just be real and authentic and people will connect with you even if you have a very small audience at first. \n\nGood luck!!",

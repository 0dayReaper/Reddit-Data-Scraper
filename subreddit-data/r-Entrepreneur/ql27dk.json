This sub is for creating and running a business, not gambling.\n\nEdit: taking all your money and dumping it in crypto, or any stock, is just investing. That's not a business. Investing=/=entrepreneurship. Investing might be a part of your business though. But if that's the only thing you're doing with your money, you're just an investor and you should go to a different sub. \n\nConvincing other people to let you invest their money and in exchange for a cut IS a business, and relevant to r/entrepreneur.

From what little I know of crypto mining, your computer needs to be good enough to \"solve\" the crypto key or whatever its called, the fastest. There are large companies entirely devoted to mining crypto, like Riot blockchain. It's probably not a good business unless you have the capital, and a cheap source of electricity, because you will need alot of both to compete with Square.",

There are people that have mined, or are mining small new projects at a loss to support the network, hoping their investment will be worth more because of their contribution. Other miners are constantly calculating amd researching the most profitable projects to mine, sometimes on a week to week basis. Their are also businesses that are mining with excess energy from places like oil or natural gas sites, hydro plants, and volcanos. They have to build the mechanisms to do so before they start. I guess I agree someone cpu mining when they aren't using their pc isn't a business, but the vast majority of hash is coming from legitimate businesses, and entrepreneurs.",

Nothing about crypto is \"More effecient\" than what we are using now, especially not the whole \"Scarcity by design\" feature where each successive generation of crypto requires more effort to decode (and thus consumes more computing and electricity resources) or whatever.",

Stable coins and a central banking digital currency will replace the current 2 tier Treasury to bank system. That's already in the works and already developed.

And the resources devoted to making that contract successful are more efficient by tenfold than the man power/hours/cost that we currently use. \n\nYou could do that all day with 1000s of industries.",

Whoever pulls it off, that would be Triple-Capital-E EEEntrepreneurship. Then you have more standard stuff, all the way down to \"domestic mining\", hotdog stands etc. The E-magic is of course the orchestration of preexisting resources, hotdogs, hungry passers-by, people who need jobs, into one harmonious, sustainable operation. I'm not big on moralizing or gatekeeping, so I am not sure why Spain is making prostitution illegal, business is thriving! But we are allowed, one might even say \"have to\", consider the implications of enterprise, call it CSR if you will, where importing $10M of electronics from China and orchestrating a robotics producer is IMHO superior to importing $10M of miners, the latter being a fools errand in many ways. Sure, creating the robotics biz is tougher, I'd say by a factor of 100x or 1000x, but the ecosystem effect is plain beautiful, allowing local suppliers to pick up production and expertise, smart grads to be hired etc. It might be that whoever used $1M to buy BTC in 2015 has made more money than whoever used $1M to create Coinbase or Binance in in 2012 or 2017, but creating Coinbase and Binance is a very complex and reusable skill, and much more r/Entrepreneur",

I can't pay for my groceries with bitcoin. I can however pay my rent, my credit card bill, and my groceries with my checking account, and If I need to send some money to a vendor across the globe, I can use western union, or paypal, or an international money transfer service, and have it accepted at more places, again for an \"almost zero fee\"",

Of course we can argue who does worse effect, but here it is very iconic and straightforward: burn energy - get money. While the energy burnt is limited and I highly doubt that miners use solar/wind power, which in turn still being produced using fossil fuels, rare earth materials etc.. \n\nI doubt that the effect on the planet is somewhat justified by their contribution into economy or progress.",

Like horrifically unstable. There is no shortage of inside trading scams, and other really under-handed tactics used in the bitcoin world, that you can't get away with in traditional investing, because traditional investing is regulated.  \n\n\nAnd that's not seen as a \"flaw\" of bitcoin. The lack of regulation is the primary selling point!   \n\n\nAnd sure, some bitcoins are \"more stable than others\" but that's largely cause you got billionaire assholes like Elon Musk propping up the ones he personally uses, so that he can increase the value of his coins, by convincing you that you want to buy them and be just like him!",

That happened because the government under-regulated the housing market.\n\nLikewise corporate bailouts occur when democracies elect shithead leaders, who do shithead things. No arguments there.\n\nMy problem with crypto though, is that rather than being a poorly regulated, corrupt market.\n\nIt's an entirely unregulated, hyper-corrupt market.\n\nI might get screwed over by how the feds handle the US banking system. I really might. But at least I have the ability to try to vote the assholes who fucked it up out of office, and try to replace them with assholes who might not screw it up quite as bad.\n\nas private enterprise, I do not have that option with crypto. If I get fucked over by blockchain, I have no recourse. I can't vote in a new board of directors to try to fix things.\n\nSo while I can't do anything about the corporate assholes on this list, I can do something about the politicians on this list.\n\n[http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1877351,00.html](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1877351,00.html)\n\nAnd yeah. Some of those guys are maybe retired now. But you know what i can also do? I can also play the \"guilt by association\" game and not support candidates who support those assholes.\n\nI can also pay attention to their political philosophies, and see if there is some kind of trend, and make a point to vote for people who don't espouse similar ideas.\n\nThe major throughline of public figures on that list by the way is the word \"deregulation\". Alan Greenspan (a libertarian) believes in deregulation. George W. Bush? A proponent of deregulation. Bill Clinton? Deregulator.  \n\n\nThat tells me I should vote against candidates running on a \"free market capitalism\" platform if i want to avoid crashes such as the 2008 housing market crisis.\n\nThe notes on the business leaders involved is basically a who's-who of assholes who exploited the fact that our markets were/are poorly regulated, or alternatively were people who flat out violated market regulations.\n\nSo if deregulation/poor enforcement of existing regulations is to blame for the 2008 crash, why should I put more faith into an entirely unregulated market?

There's plenty of people offering to take your money and invest it, they're probably also Nigerian princes'.\n\n\nI think what some people are getting at is the fact that Bitcoin and Eth are more than just currencies. They just fall into that trading bracket. \n\n\nThe real use case comes in when people are building the programmes on the Blockchain which have real world use. If someone was to build an app for Android/apple they'd be welcome here as an entrepreneur. If a developer did the same thing on Blockchain I feel like they wouldn't be as welcome, despite the fact that the app built on Eth will be far technically superior. \n\n\nBlockchain is the way of the future and those that have the know how to actually build stuff on it are the architects of tomorrow's electronic world.\n\n\nBlockchain is starting to get more and more real world uses so it's time for people to start paying attention or die out. Any neigh sayers will be left behind like the companies which thought calculators were a fad, or the companies that thought the internet was a fancy trend.\n\n\nI've provided an example of a popular real world use of Blockchain which Ed Sheeran used in France. The whole idea is to stop ticket scalpers buying all his tickets. \n\n[Ed Sheeran uses Blockchain to stop ticket scalpers](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/09/26/ed-sheeran-blockchain-france-tour/)\n\n\nImo entrepreneurs need to be fully aware of the tidal wave of technology which is about to hit us in the next decade.",

Revenue tripled quickly.\n2. I decided to keep a chunk of the company funds in BTC, ETH and LTC. The interest from those covered most of the corportate tax bills and the gains increased our holding value dramatically.\n3. Using crypto to pay bonuses out to team members increased work output overall and reduced costs in general.\n4.

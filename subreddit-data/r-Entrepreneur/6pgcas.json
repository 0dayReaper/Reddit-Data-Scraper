    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m Matt Bertulli and I\u2019m an entrepreneur, angel investor, and now author.  I like building sustainable businesses and working with good people.  \n\nAnd while my entrepreneurial journey is far from over, I thought the 9 year mark was as good a time as any to share my story and hopefully some lessons that can help you on your journey.  I\u2019ll link to a few things below so you can see that I\u2019m a real boy but there\u2019s no hidden agenda in the links (read: I have no course to sell you!).  \n\n**What I\u2019m building (right now):**  \n \n* item 1 - In 2008 I started (and still run) [Demac Media](https://www.demacmedia.com), an 8-figure business with close to 100 full time employees\n* item 2 - I am the co-founder of [Pela Case](https://pelacase.com), a 6-figure, soon to be 7-figure eCommerce brand.\n* item 3 - I\u2019ve made a handful of angel investments over the years into various industries, including eCommerce brands, an alcohol brand (Qui Tequila), and a night club.  \n* item 4 - I\u2019ve also decided to do one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever done\u2014write my first book called [Anything, Anywhere](http://mattbertulli.com). \n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing putting your thoughts down in a permanent place (especially something as permanent as an actual book) but while I was spending all that time writing, I started to reflect on how I\u2019ve gotten to where I am today. A friend of mine suggested that I write a post like this and I had run out of reasons not to!  \n\nAlso, since I started putting myself \"out there\" (speaking gigs, [medium essays](https://medium.com/@mbertulli) etc) I\u2019ve been getting questions from all corners of the interwebs and I needed to centralize this stuff so I can point people to one location. So why not reddit?  \n\nPS: I will monitor this thread and answer any questions you might have. So please, ask away!  \n\nI\u2019ve tried to structure this post into one part story, one part lessons learned, and one part common questions with my usual answers (get asked these a lot).  \n\nThis post is ~5,400 words and my team has told me it\u2019s about a 30 minute read...to set your expectations.  \n\n**The Beginning**  \n\nI started my career as a self-taught software developer.  This was in the mid-90\u2019s (I\u2019m 36 now) and to say things were different then would be\u2026well, obvious.  I am grateful for having learned to code in the 90\u2019s as it gives me great appreciation for how low the barriers have come to get into the craft. Like most, I worked a bunch of different jobs from 1999 until 2008 before deciding to break out on my own entrepreneurial journey and start Demac Media.  \n\n**Finding the Gap**  \n\nI had no business plan. Just a rough idea of what I wanted to do. I was working at Netsuite at the time and saw how much business we referred out to service partners and thought that I\u2019d rather be the guy getting referrals than the guy giving them.  It was that simple.  I sort of knew that I wanted to focus on eCommerce since I grew up in a multi-generation retail family (selling furniture) and knew the space very well.  There was also a serious lack of competition in the Canadian market in 2008 as eCommerce had yet to really gain steam with our larger retailers/brands.  That\u2019s one of the keys to our success, we were early.  Probably too early when I look back.  But none the less, we don\u2019t take it for granted that timing was certainly on our side.  \n\n**The Accidental Big Business**  \n\nI also never intended on things getting to this point. After Netsuite I really just wanted something small that made me a decent living and I could call it my own.  I just wanted to have fun with work again, so I made the leap and started Demac Media.  Many of my first hires will laugh when they read this because I was famous for saying we\u2019d never have more than 15-20 employees\u2026whoops!  \n\nAs you can tell from the title of this post, it has taken almost a decade to get to where we are.  I didn\u2019t do it alone, far from it (more on that below).  I\u2019ve had so many helping hands in the form of mentors, partners, friends and customers to count.  I learned a great deal of patience over these years and if I could tell my 27 year old self 1 thing it would be this:  \n\n** Be patient and always assume you don\u2019t know shit\u2026cause you don\u2019t. **  \n\n**Continuous Learning**  \n\nI\u2019m highly skeptical of most of what I read or hear when it comes to \u201ctop X ways to build a million dollar business in 12 months or less\u201d.  In my experience there are simply too many variables at play for someone to prescribe one way of doing things as THE way to build a great business.  \n\nHowever, I do find other entrepreneurs stories incredibly helpful.  I have done especially well with studying a wide variety of industries and stories from within those industries and then applying these lessons to my narrow-focused businesses (eCommerce).  I can spend hours a day just reading.  \n\nIn other words, I go wide in my learning and narrow in my practice.  \n\nLet\u2019s dig into my biggest lessons learned and I\u2019ll sprinkle in more back story as we go.  \n\n\n**Lesson 1 - Your network is your net-worth (thank you Jayson Gaignard from Mastermind Talks)**  \n\nI was fortunate enough to have a pretty decent network early on when we were starting Demac.  I give a lot of credit to, and received a lot of value from the early days of Lean Coffee Toronto, a group I was one of the founding members of with the guys from TWG, Bnotions, Jet Cooper and others.  We\u2019d meet weekly to talk about all things \u201cLean Startups\u201d and how they applied to our businesses.  Most of us had less than 5 employees at the time, but that peer to peer learning was foundational.  \n\nI was new to downtown Toronto when I started Demac so I invested a lot of time into getting involved with the local tech and startup community.  While exhausting I met a lot of great friends and even some mentors / advisors through these years of networking marathons.  I went into all of this just wanting to find my \u201cpeople\u201d and didn\u2019t realize just how much value would come from these relationships over time.  \n\nAnother big \u201cnetwork\u201d win for me was getting invited to Mastermind Talks (MMT) in Napa.  This is a world class event because the people in attendance are world class.  They are some of the most kind and generous humans I\u2019ve ever encountered and I can honestly say I\u2019m a better entrepreneur and better all around person because of the decision to attend and dig-in/participate.   \n\nThrough MMT I met an amazing entrepreneur that had a shared passion for mountain biking.  He was the one to convince me to join EO (Entrepreneur Network) in 2016 by inviting me to meet his forum members (all guy with businesses over 10-15M) in Toronto while they were having their quarterly meeting.  Joining this forum turned out to be another major win in equipping me with the tools I need to continue to build and grow businesses.  \n\nIt was being at MMT that also gave me the kick in the ass I needed to write my book. Meeting so many others that had taken the plunge and were still standing was encouraging.  I was scared shitless of putting my name out there in the form of something more permanent (ugh, a book) and while this path has had its own twists and turns I know it was the right one.  \n\nMy only regret was not investing more aggressively in my network earlier, especially during those early years of starting Demac Media.  \n\nTL;DR - Nobody does this shit alone.  We all need help and lots of it.  Investing in your network is one of the best things you can do if you truly want to build a good business.   \n\n\n**Lesson 2 - Build a good business first.  Ignore people telling you to dream bigger.**  \n\nIn the early days of Demac we experimented with a bunch of different niches and technologies before settling in on Magento (an eCommerce software platform) and going all-in on eCommerce.  One of the best moves we made was formally partnering up with Magento and investing in the platform.  Not only did we get to associate our relatively unknown brand with their very well known brand, we also didn\u2019t have to worry about building software from scratch and could instead focus on servicing our customers by building on something already established.  \n\nI can\u2019t stress enough how important that singular focus on one platform was early on.  Once we stopped screwing around trying to be everything to everyone, the sales and marketing engine started to really work.  I\u2019m now firmly in the differentiate-or-die camp.  Services businesses, especially agencies, need to learn this and apply it.  If you stand for everything, you stand for nothing.  \n\nTargeting a niche definitely narrows your addressable market, but the benefits far outweigh this downside.  Doing this likely means you aren\u2019t going to build a gigantic company, but who the hell *really* wants that anyway?  Most of us just want a great business that makes profits and affords us the life we desire/design.  \n\nI\u2019m a huge supporter of service based businesses.  Most will tell you there are lots of reasons these businesses suck, but dig a little deeper and the real reason people speak poorly of service businesses is because \u201cthey don\u2019t scale\u201d.  That\u2019s not entirely true.  They most certainly don\u2019t scale the same way that software/product companies do, but to say something doesn\u2019t scale is too narrow a statement.  Service businesses just scale linearly, largely based on human effort (hours).  You can still build a very good business within the constraints of service based business models, so if this is appealing to you go for it.  Ignore the people/media/whomever telling you that you have to build something that \u201cscales\u201d.  \n\n**Lesson 3 - Something about Yoda and becoming a master of something...**  \n\nI also invested a lot of time early on into learning my industry.  I\u2019m a little obsessive when it comes to needing to read everything.  It drives my wife nuts in our non-business lives since I can go down the rabbit hole on things that sometimes don\u2019t matter much.  However, in business this has served me well since I\u2019m able to keep up with a rapidly changing retail landscape.  I was spending easily 4-6 hours a day in addition to my \u201cjob\u201d just reading and making sense of everything I could get my hands on.  \n\nSide Note:  Identifying that I had a unique ability early on was really important in our hiring strategy.  I had received advice from some mentors that I should focus on what I\u2019m uniquely qualified to do and hire people to do the rest.  Massive productivity win for people trying to scale human-intensive businesses.  \n\nI continue to study retail.  When people ask me what I do I sometimes tell them I\u2019m a student of retail, since that\u2019s what I feel like most days.  While I\u2019ve been building Demac Media for 8 years, I\u2019ve spent my entire life in retail in some form or another.  It still feels like home to me and even if I weren\u2019t running Demac I\u2019d probably keep building retail focused businesses as I get tremendous satisfaction out of helping merchants succeed.  \n\nGoing narrow and becoming a master of one thing early on can feel really restrictive.  I get that.  I still think this approach has much higher chances of success than trying to create lots of business or revenue streams or whatever other bullshit [insert cheesy internet marketer here] is selling.  \n\n\n**Lesson 4 - The right customers are always right, the rest are\u2026meh.**  \n\nKey Points:  \n\n* item 1 - Listen to your great customers.  They provide you invaluable feedback.\n* item 2 - Shitty customers are just that, shitty.  Life\u2019s too short to work with assholes and assholes typically  don't bring value to the table.\n* item 3 - Our customers hire us for our expertise.  Instead of asking our customers what they want us to do, we recommend what should be done.  We\u2019re the expert, not the customer.  \n\n\nSome of my earliest customers ended up being some of our best customers.  I think we got lucky here.  I even count a few as personal friends of mine and regularly see these people outside of business.  This is something I\u2019m particularly grateful for.  I got to sit side by side with some amazing entrepreneurs that have grown retail/eCommerce companies from $0 to mid-8 figures and more.  I have experienced almost every aspect of a retail business from the warehouse to customer service and everything in between.  This has taken time, but it is paying dividends now (literally and figuratively).  Committing to learning a lot about an industry without any immediate return is very, very valuable.  \n\nFor these customers, I\u2019ve given up huge amounts of my own time ensuring they get what they need from myself and my team to ensure they are successful.  When things are working, we push, when things aren\u2019t working, we push.  These types of customers are the ones you build great businesses with.  \n\nWe\u2019ve also had some duds as customers.  All the bitching and moaning about clients you typically hear from service business owners is true, by on a case by case basis.  I feel like I\u2019ve experienced it all, but know that I probably haven\u2019t.  Everything from the high profile entrepreneur who changes his mind weekly based on what he reads or hears on a podcast, to the high power CEO who \u201cwants a partner\u201d when really just wants a whipping boy to agree with him.  Luckily these experiences are not the norm.  Most customers we\u2019ve had just want help with things they don\u2019t understand.  The very best customers know what they don\u2019t know and are experienced enough to trust others to fill in the gaps.  \n\n\n**Lesson 5 - Premature action can destroy you.**  \n\nAs we grew the company from 3 of us in my basement to 100 we had to learn all sorts of things we never thought would matter.  One of the biggest lessons was around the incalculable value that a great culture adds to a business.  In ~9 years we\u2019ve managed to have a less than 15% employee attrition rate\u2026including people we\u2019ve had to let go.  \n\nThe other more difficult lesson that stands out was not being able to keep everyone happy all the time.  Both customers and employees.  Most mistakes that lead to people being unhappy have to do with doing the right things at the wrong time.  \n\nI outline a specific example in Lesson 6 below of the outbound sales machine failures, but there have been countless other instances where we tried to do something before we were ready.  Opening in new territories, hiring people too soon (luckily not too many), looking at the wrong data at the wrong time, creating too much process too early and on and on.  I feel wiser for it, but this is the shit nobody teaches you that you just wind up having to figure out.  There\u2019s no 10-step program for this stuff.  \n\nHonestly when I think about it, the mistakes we\u2019ve made could easily fill a book.  I\u2019m sure most other entrepreneurs that have been at this a long time would probably say the same thing.  Not all mistakes are good so don\u2019t set out to \u201cfail\u201d.  The best mistakes I ever learned from were someone else's!  \n\n\n**Lesson 6 - Creating multiple, strong sales channels is how you build leverage, which is a critical component in sustainable growth.**  \n\nOnce we were out of the gate and saw we had a sustainable business I decided to focus on adding in additional sales channels that would help create a little more stability.  Depending on one channel to bring in all your revenue is a little scary once that channel gets larger (all eggs, meet 1 basket).  \n\nOur partnership with Magento was something I owned and invested a lot of time into.  Every time we got a new \u201cpartner manager\u201d at Magento I would spend time getting to know them and building that relationship.  Now we have a partner (aka - Channel) team that handles these relationships and all of the activities around managing a strong multi-channel business.  This investment into a strong channel early on gave us the sales and revenue to invest into other channels that we acquired customers through.  \n\n~3 years into the business we started to focus heavily on this new thing that people were calling Inbound Marketing.  Shit, we even bought the software (Hubspot) to go along with the buzzword!  To date we\u2019ve published more than 1,100 articles and this is still a major pillar in our marketing engine as our Demac blog gets upwards of 50-60k visitors / mo.  Most of that traffic is just coming to us to learn, but it has helped us establish some thought leadership in our industry and that in turn helps us acquire and convert business.  \n\nWe\u2019re now using our partnerships and inbound channels as leverage to create an outbound sales team that goes after our dream list of customers.  We have had some failed attempts at creating an outbound team / machine and now that I\u2019m looking back we were simply too early in chasing these.  We believe we\u2019re ready now, but who knows, maybe I\u2019ll be doing another reddit post in a few years about how we failed here again. (God I hope not)  \n\n\n**Lesson 7 - Compounded, steady growth is sanity.**  \n\nYou can double your business by growing 25% / year for 3 years.  My desired growth of 25-30% per year seemed painfully slow at first, but compounded over time it made for some pretty significant gains in years 4 through 7.  \n\nOne of the things I was repeatedly told by my parents and grandparents as they ran their stores was that cash flow was king.  This translated into a bunch of different thought tracks for me, but mostly it meant that if I wanted to grow my company I\u2019d have to do so very tactically, which meant calculated growth that wasn\u2019t too slow and wasn\u2019t too fast so that we best used our cash and didn\u2019t run out.  We managed to mostly pull this off, with only 2 years in 8 where we went too far in one direction or the other for a variety of reasons.  We targeted somewhere in the 25-30% YoY growth range and usually fell into it.  \n\nHaving grown up in a small family business (our family sold furniture retail) I was no stranger to the ups and downs of this life.  I knew there would be tough times.  I knew it would take its toll on my family (still does).  However, even knowing this and going into it eyes wide open there were still times where I got the wind knocked out of me.  Shit, I still have days and sometimes weeks where I ask myself what the fuck I\u2019m doing with my life.  Thankfully I mostly enjoy what I do for a whole variety of reasons and when I spend time thinking about the alternatives I quickly regain focus.  \n\n\n**Lesson 8 - Adopt an Operating System**  \n\nAbout 1.5 years ago we started to adopt Traction / EOS (look it up) and it has been a game changer in helping us achieve operational scale to match our sales and revenue scale.  This is another thing I would stress to my younger self.  Sheer force-of-will is what got the company to 5M+.  Having an operating system that everyone in the business is using is what is taking us further.  \n\nAround the same time (2 years ago) we also started to invest in what buzzword business folks like to call \u201csenior leadership\u201d.  There were a number of reasons for this, but mostly it had to do with me needing to focus on wearing 1 hat instead of 5. I couldn\u2019t effectively lead/steer the ship if I was stuck in the weeds and I needed help if I was going to get out.  We formalized an exec team at this point and they are the fine folks who run the company day to day now while I focus on where the group of companies is going.  \n\nImplementing EOS/Traction with the team in place was painful but ultimately I think it will be one of our best moves yet.  Having our entire company learn this new operating system together is allowing us to all to support one another, even though it sometimes feels a little pointless.  \n\nPart of EOS/Traction is having what is called a Vision-Traction Organizer (VTO).  The basic idea is that it is a one page document that helps clarify your 3 year vision for your business.  It is a great tool to help you achieve alignment in your teams.  Ours has us continuing to grow Demac while also building out some additional products and business lines.  As long as we can we will continue to help commerce evolve, that\u2019s our purpose.  I suspect that the companies are going to go through a lot of changes in the coming 3-5 years as the retail landscape is just full of change right now and there\u2019s no way we position ourselves perfectly all the time.  \n\n\n**Lesson 9 - Never stop laying foundation.  It\u2019s the hard work, the uncomfortable work, but the right kind of work.**  \n\nAlong the way I learned that I love 'thoroughbred\u2019 businesses, a term that I\u2019ve lovingly adopted from my friend Andrew Wilkinson over at Meta.  There are too many reasons to list in this post as to why I think everyone needs to bootstrap and build businesses so all I\u2019d recommend you do is read material from 37 Signals/Basecamp as a good starting point.  Demac Media and Pela Case are 100% bootstrapped / self funded.  We are focused on being good businesses, not big businesses.  \n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, and especially as I\u2019ve become a father (daughter, she\u2019s 2), I care a lot less about how \u201csexy\u201d something is in business and care far more about doing things that support a lifestyle that I\u2019ve yet to figure out entirely (not sure I will).  Relationships are the key to almost all definitions of success and I\u2019m still trying to figure out what that means as my wife and I figure out how we want to live\u2026hence the lifestyle comment.  \n\nIn late 2015 I struck a deal with a fellow named Jeremy Lang to acquire 45% of Pela Case, which at the time was an idea he had been perfecting to make compostable iPhone cases.  I didn\u2019t so much care about building a phone case company as I did about creating a better kind of product company, one that left little to no footprint.  This decision was not just good business but also satisfied a personal need to start helping commerce evolve to a better place, and to me that meant commerce/retail needed to get a lot less wasteful.  I won\u2019t go into it too much, but you can only help sell so much garbage (most product people buy is landfill bound) before it starts to weigh on you.  I\u2019m determined to help change this global retail machine into something that we can be proud of leaving to future generations.  \n\nIn the middle of 2016 we created a program at Demac Media we called Merchant in Residence.  The program was modelled after the Entrepreneur in Residence found at my Venture Capitalists, with the basic idea being that we\u2019d hire a young entrepreneur to be and give them a brand to build with the backing of Demac Media\u2019s resources.  Enter Sunta, our first MIR and the driving force behind Pela Case growing into a 6 figure business within 6 months and is well on its way to being a 7 figure business by the end of 2017.  \n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**  \n\n**Q: How are you growing Pela?**  \n\nI get some version of this question a lot, especially since Demac has worked with hundreds of merchants in various stages of growth/scale.  Everyone wants to know what the secret to building an eCommerce business is and mostly that means they want the silver bullet or tactic that gets them tons of qualified, money-in-hand traffic.  \n\nTruth is, there is no easy answer here and it makes me a little sick trying to think about writing down every little thing I know about this subject.  Here are some of my favourite responses / points that I share whenever I get asked...  \n\n1) Focus on one major channel and master it.  There\u2019s only so many online channels that have meaningful scale and the tools to let you test lots of shit to see what works.  The big 4 (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest) are where 99% of us need to start and I like to pick one to go all in on before trying to master others.  For Pela we\u2019ve been heavy into Facebook/Insta (same ad tool) from day 1 and are only now moving on to Google.  \n\n2) Do things manually before trying to automate.  You won\u2019t know what to automate until you\u2019ve done the grunt work.  For example, do manual influencer outreach before you go and get a service/system to do it for you.  Your ROI will be an order of magnitude higher.  \n\n3) Largely ignore all the \u201cHow to build a 7 figure eCommerce business\u201d people out there.  Most are just telling you to find a product on Alibaba, knock it off (white/private label it) and sell it on Amazon.  This is hardly the path to what I would call a good business.  Its not sustainable and it certainly isn\u2019t teaching you shit about what its like to really build a brand/business.  \n\n4) Don\u2019t buy every fucking app for your Shopify store.  You don\u2019t need them all at the start and you likely won\u2019t need most of them for a very long time.  Get the essentials first, and by essentials I mean whatever you require to support that first major channel you are going to focus on.  Start adding in additional apps like referral programs, loyalty, complex email flows, and other stuff only once you have a foundation.  \n\n5) Ecommerce costs money.  Why?  Because inventory.  When you enter the world of physical stuff, there\u2019s a natural overhead that comes with it and it's very different from its digital cousins.  This is a very hard industry to get into without some seed capital.  Pela has taken $100k of investment (in straight cash, not time) to get the business growing 15-25% per month.  \n\n6) There\u2019s only two ways to scale an eCommerce company.  Slowly and profitably or fast and unprofitably.  Don\u2019t believe me, do a google search for failed eCommerce startups and tell me how many you find that achieved massive scale and are still around today and/or are in good shape.  If you trust me, save yourself the google search and let me tell you its a very short list.  You\u2019re far more likely to succeed in eCommerce if you aim to build a small, very profitable business slowly than trying to scale quickly.  \n\n7) This is Amazon\u2019s world and we know it.  We are starting to use Amazon as a channel to help us get volume leverage, but that\u2019s about all we use Amazon for.  Our intent is to build Pela into a great, global brand and the way to do that isn\u2019t by allowing Amazon to keep all those customer relationships behind their walls. We are only now (Q3 2017) looking to add Amazon Marketplace on as a channel for Pela and we won\u2019t even be putting all of our products on it as we want to create awareness and leverage back to pelacase.com main site.  \n\n**Q: What\u2019s the most difficult thing about running a company this size?  Or multiple companies for that matter?**  \n\nBalance.  Growing businesses require a lot of nurturing.  The people, the customers, the processes, everything really.  I believe balance is bullshit, but its the only term that everyone seems to understand when I answer this question.  My goal is to operate in a state of flow.  I can tell when I\u2019m out of it as everything I do feels harder, professionally, spiritually, emotionally, all of it.  The ups and downs of building a business has got to be one of the most consistent methods of knocking you out of flow.  \n\nManaging large teams is really difficult (next question will dig in to this).  The best businesses I\u2019ve seen have very simple operating models.  The main challenge with Demac Media is that being a service business with more than 1 service offering is that it is complex and therefor requires more management overhead to scale.  The relationship between scale &amp; complexity is something I think about a lot.  Adding in multiple companies just makes my work more complex but I try and keep the individual businesses fairly isolated so they don\u2019t create complexity for each other (this is also hard when under the same physical roof).  \n\n**Q: Do you like having so many employees?**  \n\nMost of the time, yes.  Sometimes, no.  That\u2019s the honest answer.  I\u2019ve never met an entrepreneur who loves having a lot of employees all of the time.  There are days where I really enjoy seeing so many people helping me on this journey.  Then there are days where I think that the best business is the one without customers or employees (not rational, but honest).  I often have to remind myself that people are messy.  Relationships of any kind are messy.  \n\nTo expect the people side of any part of your life to be sunshine and roses at all times seems a little foolish.  Business is no different.  \n\nOne of the biggest challenges in scaling teams is communication.  It is very easy for things to get lost in translation with lots of people in a company.  \n\nAs I mentioned above, it\u2019s hard keeping everyone happy all the time.  As the leader this is really hard on me emotionally.  I don\u2019t like it when anyone is unhappy as a result of a decision I\u2019ve had to make.  Sometimes I wish I was a bit more thick skinned but after almost a decade of doing this I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be ok making decisions that will result in someone not getting what they want/need.  Trade offs suck, especially with people.  \n\n**Q: What\u2019s my definition of success?**  \n\nFirst, this is totally subjective.  Regardless of your definition, success and failure sit on a spectrum so it\u2019s good to recognize this and not get too obsessive with an absolute definition of one or the other.  To me success has more to do with freedom of choice combined with some positive impact.  I want the freedom to choose how I spend my time and I get joy from having impact.  \n\nThat said, I\u2019m really careful and somewhat protective of my time now.  It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m 100% confident in not being able to make more of.  This is probably the one thing I\u2019d tell my 25 year old self to think more about if I could.  Having the freedom to choose how you spend your time should also mean taking the time to figure out what charges you up and gives you purpose.\n\n**Q: What\u2019s your exit strategy (hate this one)?**  \n\nI\u2019ve lost count of how many times I\u2019ve been asked this question over the years.  I never set out to sell Demac and don\u2019t have any immediate plans to do so.  I\u2019ve always said that for me to sell it would need to be a life-changing deal.  I know that selling a company successfully is a very rare thing so I focus on building a good business first and believe that if I do that there will be opportunities to exit along the way.  \n\nI also think that there are many forms of an \u201cexit\u201d.  They don\u2019t all mean selling or IPO.  There are very large companies where the founders are no longer operational but rather shareholders and stewards of the business.  I don\u2019t have an opinion on which type of exit is better because I haven\u2019t put a lot of thought into it.  \n\nMy last comment on this.  A few years ago I was listening to a podcast (forget which) where some entrepreneur was talking about how every business he\u2019s started he knew the exit strategy from day 1.  It always struck me as kind of odd that you\u2019d build a business to leave it as quickly as possible\u2026that didn\u2019t feel right.  \n\nDigital Me -&gt; [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbertulli/), Twitter: @mbertulli, [Medium](https://medium.com/@mbertulli)\n\n",

We didn't build out a very strong email marketing platform until we had a decent number of daily signups (50+).  Once we hit this threshold, we knew that putting some time and effort into a proper welcome series was actually going to produce a return that was greater than the effort.\n\nYou experienced this first hand :)",

It's really humbling and motivating to see someone who has managed to develop something truly successful by remaining patient and keeping their head down; really makes me think I'm not as far off the mark as I tend to feel....So, thanks for writing this up, definitely puts a lot of things in perspective.",

Like I said, Ive been busting my butt trying to understand what truly makes a successful retailer (both B&amp;M and e-comm) and it's been really demanding and time consuming because I've always believed that to truly understand something you need to know it on every level, so I have been running B&amp;M locations and introducing those principles to the e-comm companies I have worked with. A lot of people definitely have a skewed view of what I do as if it was 'beneath' me (because I work in stores... idk why but it is what it is) but I always felt like it was to provide the foundation for something more... thanks again!",

I imagine you have an inconsistent day-to-day, travel to meet new potential clients, conferences, etc. How do you make time for your family, friends, and most importantly yourself?\n",

It's probably not even the easiest path to get freedom.  But none the less a lot of us do it knowing what we're going to have to sacrifice, if even for a little while.\n\nFor me, the first 5 years were the hardest on the personal life.  Lots of long  days, very little vacation, and almost no self-care.  \n\nToday, I'm getting better at the self care thing, although climbing out of that hole is fucking hard.\n\nToday, I'm spending a lot more time with my wife and daugther.  I couldn't have made this choice without my team @ Demac.  Huge thanks to them.\n\nToday, I choose to spend more time with my friends.  \n\nThere's some harvard study about happiness that basically says that our happiness has most to do with the quality of our relationships than anything else.  So I'm trying to do this.",

Stand up, ask for help.\n\nNow, when our team is 5x the size and distributed, communication is an order of magnitude more difficult.  I don't see this getting any easier as we continue to grow.  \n\nPeople also receive and process information differently.  Some are visual, some like to read, some like to hear etc.  This means that the more people you have to communicate with the more frequent the messages need to be and then you also need more varied formats / delivery methods.",

He is a European manufacturer. Now the thing is that I created a content team and I feel that we produce very good inhouse magazine for the client and we can take more clients. But working with clients scares me a lot - most of them are uneducated in what we do and have wrong or unrealistic expectations or no clue what we do therefore no patience for results. How did you overcome this? At one point I started thinking of contacting bigger agencies and working as a subcontractor.",

More so than actually getting started, it seems. From what I have read, it is extremely important to find like-minded people and build a network before you start your first venture. I am having trouble with this. I live in Paris, which is not the best place to meet entrepreneurs who speak English (I am working on my French). Trying to work with friends in the US is difficult due to the time difference. What would you recommend I do? Starting by myself, in a vacuum, is a scary undertaking. Thanks in advance!",

My company, after pivoting multiple times to land in a realm where we feel comfortable on our goals, is working in the growing market of gaming/esports.

Vague, I know (sorry), but you'd be amazed at how often I see something and I wonder if I'm the only one who sees it.  For example, I knew I wanted to do something with Pela Case the moment Jeremy told me about it.  I certainly wasn't looking for a phone case 'play' and then decided to research to find a niche.",

The way you grow your businesses provides value in the methods of slow and thoughtful buildouts, strategies with purpose, and not looking for a get rich and get out tactic. It generates a much more sustainable long term planning capability over time.\n\nIn the early stages did you find it difficult to come up with long term plans because of a lack of history/data in your company? What strategies have you used to develop more future-based ideas beyond the short term goal completions of a business?",

How do you do that with Demac Media?\n2. I meet a ton of agency owners whose claim to fame happened back in the early 2000s when search engine rankings was easy pickings and competition was nowhere near as fierce.  This gave them an early monopoly on revenue which platformed them for future growth.  By their own admission, if they had started again today without that unfair advantage they would have surely failed.  **My Question:** To what degree do you believe this influenced your own success?\n\nThanks!",

We're heavily invested in content marketing (inbound), account marketing (outbound), channel marketing (joint marketing with partners), and referrals.  The combination of all of these makes sure we get the appropriate number of qualified leads in every week to keep the beast fed.\n\n2) We were started after the easy days of SEO, so I don't think we're riding this wave as much as some others that started in the early 2000's (we started in 2008/2009).  We did however go deep into \"inbound marketing\" 5 years ago and started writing our little buts off then.  I know that this content still produces results for us and had we not started this 5 years ago we wouldn't be benefiting now. \n\nWe also got into Magento and Shopify in the early days and established VERY deep partnerhips with them.  These are extremely difficult to replicate today if you don't have something to bring to the table that gets these monster software companies to pay attention to you.  This is what I would call my \"easy days of SEO\" unfair advantage.",

I know so many local agencies that are dependent exclusively on local organic SEO - they're one Google algo update away from negative cash flow.\n\nThat's cool that you have those kinds of partnerships -- I can't imagine how hard it would be to get in the door there today.\n\nThanks for the advice.",

Another way to phrase my question is, is the exposure you get from putting yourself out there outweigh the negative risk of having possible trust issues from people trying to take advantage of you?",

I've purchased your book and I'm looking forward to reading it!    \n    \nI have tons of questions, but two burning ones in particular: 1. With Demac, how did you primarily handle sales - did you sell them a package(i.e. 1 website, $30k), or set it up at a monthly rate?  Also, did you ever take equity from a company, i.e. They pay you $10, and 5% of all future profits?  If so, how often did you do this, and was it successful?    \n    \nFor networking, what is your Pareto's law(if applicable) - What 20% of networking activity yielded 80% of the results?  Thank you! :)",

We try and balance how much of each we go get.  I've only done a handful of equity deals and they didn't work out :)\n\n2) Hosting local dinners with small, invite only groups of people is way more fruitful than big events. ",

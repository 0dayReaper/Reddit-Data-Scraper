I consistently hit brick walls, and made a total of 0 dollars. \n\nUntil last night, I launched an AI product (my last one before I head to uni) and hit $37 ARR within 4 HOURS.\n\nStill haven't gotten off the high, the first internet dollar hits so, so different.\n\nBig learning from my marketing efforts - specific communities really matter. If you have a great product and can market yourself in niche audiences, you'll win. In my case, this was a niche AI newsletter I requested to feature me. Best of luck to y'all!\n\nEdit: for everyone flooding my DMs asking for the tool, it\u2019s https://scribbly.shop. I\u2019m not trying to promote anything here, but if you\u2019ve got any constructive questions ask them in public so everyone benefits.\n\nEdit: $850 ARR NOW HOLY SHIT",

I would bring your second section \"Scribbly feels like magic...\" up to the very top as this sells it for me. \"We reimagined typing...\" doesn't really give me much info. \n\nA few other points - which browser does it work with? I'm assuming Chrome but it doesn't say anywhere? Also how do you actually use it? I'm assuming it's \"Simply type /scrib\", but it would be good to have a tiny bit more detail on using the product.\n\nGreat work though, all the best for the future.",

Works on Chrome and related browsers, will add that to the site now.\n\nAnd yup simply typing /scrib is how it works! Also a bunch more commands that might come in handy like /code and /elongate.  \n\n\nThank you so, so much for the feedback.",

Right now, I had to scroll down quite a bit to find out. It's really cool. But I suspect your bounce rate is pretty high because it's not so clear what the product is at first glance.\n\nI would also suggest experimenting a little on your pricing structure. People skimming the page quickly may think your product is $27 a month as monthly subscriptions are very common. This could put people off. There's lots of info out there on the psychology of pricing.",

I've been in sales for 6 years, and know what it takes to grow an audience. \n\nFirstly, grow your online presence. Get on LinkedIn and start posting instantly. Connect with the right audience, ONLY directors and managers. Use ChatGPT to create engaging posts.\n\nStart messaging these people, not some horrible sales pitch. But simply 'I need a pair of eyes to look over my new business' - They are the 'experts' remember.\n\nStart showcasing the product, use video like you have done on your website homepage. Let people see what it does INSTANTLY. Else they will lose interest.\n\nKeep your daily posting up across all social medias, but I do think your LinkedIn needs to be the most focused on for the minute.\n\nKeep your branding clean and fresh, and fucking smash it mate. Happy to keep in touch with each other to see how we are getting on. I need a group of like minded individuals around me.",

If you don\u2019t use mailgun or sendgrid, keep your daily sends capped at 150 emails per day to protect your sending reputation. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s a \u2018brute force\u2019 approach, it may well generate you a decent enough MRR to begin investing in a proper inbound marketing strategy - costing you circa $120 a month. \n\nA bonus tip: find a few of those AI gurus on LinkedIn, who share posts like \u201820 AI tools you need to adopt in 2023\u2019, and see if any of them will include your tool in their lists/suggestions. \n\nGood luck mate! The fact you\u2019ve even made something like this would suggest to me you\u2019re gonna make decent money in life.",

Maybe it doesn't matter and if in a few months your off to uni having a great time and with a nice resume line item it's all good.  And $30 is pretty cheap.  But i rolled a gpt plugin up for my IDEs in an hour or two and I've made chrome plugins in about the same amount of time. Pretty sure i could hire someone on Fiverr to make this for me for $10.\n\nWhere's the moat?\n\nEdit: also congrats!  This is great and your first self made dollar, Internet or otherwise, is always a rush!  Well done!",

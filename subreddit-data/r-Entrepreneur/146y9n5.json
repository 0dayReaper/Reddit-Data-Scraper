I like to read the ones related to my industry (tech), so I read a lot of biographies, and books written in the 90\u2019s to teach how to start, grow, and manage tech products. You would be surprised of how things change, and still continue the same. Let me know if you want know more!",

There is always something to do on the weekends but lately Ive been trying to stay off the phone. You need to set ground rules for all clients. When I first started I worked 24/7 - anytime I would answer my phone. Not anymore.\n\nI also own a mobile iv therapy company that also does runs 7 days a week. That could be hard but overall I try and turn everything off during the weekends. You need to reset sometime. Burn out is a real thing.",

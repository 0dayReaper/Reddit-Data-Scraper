    "postText": "My father was interested in owning a mobile home, but we found out its not really a good investment if you don't own the park its on, the mobile home it self is a lot of headache.\n\nSo is the idea to put a park and then have people show up with their mobile homes instead or do you 1) buy land 2) buy mobile homes and sell them on your land? \n\nAnyway how much does a mobile space costs to own in CA? It seems to me if you gona have to buy a park and mobile home its gona take lots of initial capital compared to an apartment and renting it or is it the same?",

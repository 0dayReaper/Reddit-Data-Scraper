            "comment": "Every startup is an idea for non-devs, so long as the non-dev brings the funding.\n\nBut if you want to bootstrap it with sweat equity here\u2019s five ideas.\n\n1.\tArchitecture firm\n2.\tEnvironmental Impact Assessment company\n3.\tVenture Capital fund.\n4.\temployer-of-record company \n5.\tcommodities trading firm\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about these ideas is that they require a bit of specialized knowledge to get going which reduces the competition you\u2019d face compared to, say, a t-shirt or landscaping company. You might need to take some courses or a degree, and it might help to work in the field for a bit for some of these. \n\nSome might require raising funds or having your own to really get started. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll start the next Glencore with [one red paperclip](http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/2010/11/one-red-paperclip.html), but it\u2019d be a heck of a story if you did.\n\nIt is important for any project that you do, that you have a reason for people to switch to being your customer. It could be reputation, or a new approach, or solving a particular problem others don\u2019t. For example:\n\n1.\tAn architecture firm that designs earthquake-resistant buildings in T\u00fcrkiye  \n2.\tA company doing environmental impact assessments using big data and AI much more quickly than a traditional approach \n3.\tA VC fund with a celebrity entrepreneur as a partner.\n4.\tan EoR company that has recruitment partners in countries nobody else sources from allowing turn-key outsourcing and fully-remote staff.\n5.\ta commodities trading firm that offers full price transparency so suppliers switch to you.\n\nMaybe none of these appeal. But no matter your choice, I recommend learning as much as you can about an area you find interesting, and the business ideas will emerge from that.",

Being a Dev means you can build the MvP yourself. Hiring a dev means you bring the money. \n\nWhere it doesn\u2019t work is when there is no money, and the plan is to have a dev work for free to make the MVP to raise money on that. \n\nWhat does work if you\u2019re a solo non-dev is to make a slide deck and get a pre-seed investment from a business angel to hire the dev to build the MvP.  Your job is then to make the slide deck and talk to angel investors.",

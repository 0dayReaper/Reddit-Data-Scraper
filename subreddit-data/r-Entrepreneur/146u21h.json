People will generally tend to believe you if the very next thing you do is pull out your ray-gun and zap something.\n\nPoint being people say lots of shit, and that's okay. What they do either proves it or disproves it. You can not separate the claim from the proof. And you really shouldn't go around talking bullshit when you know you can't back up your claims in a business situation. People seem to forget that.\n\nBest means nothing without context. If you can go ahead and prove it, you ain't braggin.\n\nLet's not forget forums are nothing but this, and a common question is about what's best. People may not put their full faith in everything anybody says, but it is largely accepted if not exactly trusted.",

When I complained they said they were \u201cThe Best\u201d headlight company. I looked up their reviews (opps, too late) , and there was nothing but problems with this shit bag company.",

I don't trust them, I don't believe them. I may may not actively avoid them if there are no other options nearby (would that make them best, they're the only option?)\n\nYou could give someone a phone and tell them it is the  best phone. Bit would it be the best phone for *them?* best is so subjective you can throw it into almost anything with no legal consequences. It's one of those positive but otherwise useless filler words that may pull some more customers to start with but ultimately their reputation and business practices is what makes or breaks them.\n\nI can say these are the best fries and you may not agree, in fact everyone can disagree with me, but it still would not be wrong because they are the best fries for me. I like them, it's opinion, subjective, not fact. How do I know the business with best in it is not subjective, but fact? I can't, therefore it is subjective. It can also be false if there are better options. Any business would like to think they are the best. And to succeed they have to be good at their niche, but that still doesn't truly mean they are the best.\n\nBest can also take on so many meanings, which is why it is vague. Is it the best because it's the most environmentally friendly? Because it has the best customer service? Best prices? Best quality? Best flooring in their buildings? Best hairdos on their employees? It implies best at everything, but I don't think any business has accomplished that. There's always something a business is lacking in, whether it be a major or minor thing, visible to customers or not. It would put me on the search for their faults soon after discovering why they claim to be best, but perhaps that is just me.\n\npersonally I would avoid it, bit it does seem to work for some people.",

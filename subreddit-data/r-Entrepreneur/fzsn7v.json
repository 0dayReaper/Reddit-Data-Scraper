Elated much :)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHi Folks!\n\nPicked up an interesting (and much famous thread) from twitter by a user named Naval (founder of AngelList) on twitter.\n\nHere's a summary of the tweetstorm.\n\nLink to the twitter thread -   [https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) \n\n \\---------------------\n\nSeek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.\n\nUnderstand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.\n\nIgnore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.\n\nYou will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.\n\nPick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.\n\nThe Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.\n\nPlay iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\n\nPick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.\n\nDon't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\n\nLearn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\n\nArm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.\n\nSpecific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.\n\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\n\nBuilding specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.\n\nWhen specific knowledge is taught, it\u2019s through apprenticeships, not schools.\n\nSpecific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.\n\nEmbrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\n\nThe most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.\n\n\u201cGive me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\u201d  \n\\- Archimedes\n\nFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).\n\nCapital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.\n\nLabor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don\u2019t waste your life chasing it.\n\nCapital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.\n\nCode and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.\n\nAn army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.\n\nIf you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.\n\nLeverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.\n\nJudgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.\n\nThere is no skill called \u201cbusiness.\u201d Avoid business magazines and business classes.\n\nStudy microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.\n\nReading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.\n\nYou should be too busy to \u201cdo coffee,\" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.\n\nSet and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.\n\nWork as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.\n\nBecome the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.\n\nThere are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.\n\nApply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.\n\nWhen you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.\n\n\n\nHave a great day :)\n\nP.S- If you found this helpful, then do consider reading my interviews with women running profitable businesses at [WomenHustlers](https://womenhustlers.com/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=Post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Naval_post)  :)",

That was my mistake. When I was pulling in 15k a month it was all cruise control and wasteful spending. By the time I realized I had to get my shit together, the attrition had put me in debt and unable to smoothly transition to something else. Seriously don\u2019t let it happen. 3 years wasted dude.",

Make money on the arbitrage. Super easy but a lot of overhead. Finding a good system can cost a lot of money in trial and error, and lead gen is filled with soulless sharks. \n\nAnd you\u2019d be surprised how often people fall from grace. For me, when you have that kind of income, you\u2019re expenses are way up, and strangely just years before when I was super agile, I was no longer.  Not much room for error when you have to find money for a business but also get a new used car, pay unexpected legal bills, pay the rent, insurance, etc overhead in life which was no longer a small studio apartment and some luggage. Now if I got 10k I\u2019d have some bill catch up, and some left over for a new business... but I need 30k for that business but in theory can get away with 8k if I don\u2019t mess up and it goes to plan. But since I\u2019m so behind on the ideal amount being put in, every month may bring in 12k into my pocket, but so much is going out, I barely have 2k to live off...\n\nIt\u2019s one of those situations where after you get a large life overhead and can\u2019t scale down and experience unexpected costs.... having a shitty month sucks. It wasn\u2019t like 4 years ago where a shit month meant I was still making more than enough to bank some and can afford 3 months of outright experimentation.",

I was able to return and provide good some of money to my family. I did not worry about money for food in the last 6 years but ended up spending much of my time online, reading, reading news, watching movies almost all the time even in the time that I need to work, still scrolling in Facebook and pretending to my employer that I am working. Then I found my self in the dilemma: I am willing to leave the internet, literally leave it, but I work using the internet and whenever I starred on the screen, all hell is loose again, reading, scrolling, watching as if it was automatic since the last 5 years. Most of my day, I spent from 8-15 hours doing it, really, until 2-4 am in the morning, waking up mostly at noon, but my work should start at 8am my time. It is even doing harm to my health. Last year is the peak and it was amplified with lots of trouble in other areas of my life like I located my Mom after 25 years only to found out that he literally abandon us, something that I didn't know in the last 25 years. I thought she's just hiding with my father. \n\nAnother problem is the way I handling my money. I attended a seminar more than a year ago about financial management and found out that if I just handled my money well, I'll work in a year, then don't work in another year with the same lifestyle. My wife and I are not materialistic people, but since I am the only one that has a good income being an online freelancer, all my family and even my wife's family become so depended on us, borrowing money here and there for whatever reason like they don't have food during that day, but I still find myself giving the money. And most of these people say nasty things and did not treat me well during my 2 years of financial trouble. My wife and I calculated my income for the first time in the last 5 years, then we are shocked to found out that we only utilize around 15-20% of my income for the last 5 years. 80-85% of my salary is gone. If we utilize it well, I can literally stop working now and did not worry about money anymore and pursue only my dream.\n\nThat being said, the last 6 years of my life IS WASTED, literally. Then December last year, I said to myself and to my wife, \"Wow, this is not good. I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this anymore.\"  And since last January, I always fight to change all of this. Happy to say that after several things that happen to my life since last December, I made some progress. My feeling now is mostly good though I still found myself sleeping in 2-3 am in the morning sometimes. But I felt that the next 5 years will be different. People say 2020 is the worst year because of the COVID 19 pandemic (still reading the news every day about this), but I can say that this year will be different for me. I really looking forward to seeing this post in the next five years and by that time, for sure, I have a different, much much better, life.",

Yeah if all you are reading is fashion magazines then almost any game would be better.   But books can be much more densely packed with the same brain stimulating engagement than games can be. For example you have to wait for a game to present you with something stimulating.  With reading you hop to wherever.  Books are all \u201cunlocked\u201d from the get go.  Also you only have to play through one tutorial on books.",

I just want to clarify I\u2019m not being argumentative. It\u2019s pretty irrelevant. I just feel like games are capable of the same brain stimulating engagement that Kant or Plato brings me. There are a lot of books not worth reading, and a lot of games not worth playing, but my favorite games are those that really challenge my brain, and not just in a \u201cpuzzle game\u201d kind of way. \n\nLike, playing Detroit: Become Human genuinely made me rethink how I see the world in some ways. And video games are capable of a different kind of immersion than books are. \n\nI think the difference comes from there being many many many video games that require no thinking whatsoever, and the video games that do just require some abstract strategic or spacial thinking. \n\nBut there are, and more importantly, is the potential for, many more games which genuinely challenge the way you think, force you to think critically about the world around you and think in a way that is philosophical about how things work, the structure of our society, and what life really is about. \n\nAnd the thing is, most people who read, read books that don\u2019t really teach you anything. Self help books don\u2019t really have a ton of merit in academic study, nor does the average novel, for that matter. And the same thing goes for games. But video games haven\u2019t been around long enough for monumental games to be made that rival the works of Aristotle in their depth and thinking. And that\u2019s okay, and you can\u2019t hold that against the medium. \n\nThere are brilliant games coming out that challenge you to think about things differently. I love to play these games, and I love reading dense political philosophy texts. They both have a place. \n\nIf games aren\u2019t constantly stimulating you intellectually in the same way that books are, then that isn\u2019t a problem with the medium, it\u2019s a problem with the individual games. I reject the idea that games can\u2019t improve you as a person.",

Don't be uninspired because your girlfriend or wealthier friends disdain your hobby. \n\nGolf and games can both lead to valuable relationships.  There's a bar to entry for many hobbies,  that may lead to more valuable relationships.  That's seeking leverage,  but also status. Those around you will usually confuse the two.  Games have given me work,  business networking, and a pool of employees. My ex girlfriend would've rather me be playing golf, or what she saw value in. Thousands coming in from contacts made through IRC, gaming and new relationships from poker showed true value that she failed to comprehend. \n\nCriticism of hobbies is about you.  If your dopaminergic system is wired to only game rewards,  or if you're too young and inexperienced to find that leverage with gaming, that's also you.  I track my time with Grindstone 2. I Bullet Note my life.  Knowing how productive you are,  and what the story really is will surprise you.  People who attribute failings to gaming aren't keeping track,  and have little metrics,  thus their understanding is based in opinion rather than fact.",

Never hit rock bottom and rarely ever had a hangover. In the last year I noticed several health issues that are only explained by alcohol, fatty liver, etc, so I decided to do a dry quarantine and will probably try my hand at weekend only moderation in May. If strict moderation fails, I\u2019ll have to give up alcohol completely.\n\nThe evening cravings were a bit of a bitch the 1st week, but luckily nowhere near as strong, frequent or long lasting as nicotine.\n\nIt may help you to research all the horror stories of people who drink less than 15 a day and still die young. Going down the rabbit hole of alcohol statistics shows how no joke it is. Apparently ~3 million people die every year from ~200 alcohol related diseases. Anyway, good luck!",

The only way he\u2019s made money, is by selling material that lies about how he got rich! Finally the worst, he constantly sells himself as a consultant to MLM companies so they can use his name to legitimize their pyramid scheme. Amway has paid him large amounts of money, to get him to say that you can \u201clive the life of the rich dad\u201d by becoming an IBO for Amway.\n\nSo yes there are some good lessons in the book, but the author is such a scam artist that it\u2019s not worth the read.",

Finally reaching it in a couple of decades, visualizing the red carpet and my own premiere, is what pushes me today. That\u2019s my vision. It\u2019s intrinsic motivated. But it won\u2019t make sense to work at it just yet. That\u2019s why I\u2019m instead building up multiple ecommerce businesses. You need to understand that the more passionate you are about something the more you think about it. That\u2019s normally a pretty good indicator. If you just started your journey you\u2019ll very likely find everything interesting and cool. That\u2019s because you\u2019re motivated through things from outside (status) and inside (true fulfillment). \n\nI still suffer from it but all of us are somehow stuck in the shiny object syndrome. You can also apply that to goals. Are those goals really your goals? Or are they goals someone else wants to achieve? And you only pursue them in hope it will fulfill you, too? \n\nThat\u2019s at least what made me waste a good bunch of progress over the last couple of years. \n\nI also think most people have a fundamental goal. For me it\u2019s building. Building amz FBA brands, building Shopify stores, crafting new things, crafting apps  - and eventually my movie.\n\nEdit: typos",

Targeted perseverance is good, but perseverance for perseverance's sake isn't. And on a similar vein, luck is a whole lot like knowing how to recognize and jump on opportunities. Also, neither action nor perseverance is very \"actionable\". I can't take those and apply them to my life, especially luck.\n\nI don't want a newer person to this to come along and read this and expect to be amazing and make a million dollars only if they persevere, and hope for luck along the way, because that's just not actionable. This mindset also takes very little responsibility for their actions, and as a consequence they aren't able to feel like they deserved it if they do get the good results. Both of these are an issue. I'm not trying to rip on you, I just want to make sure others are thinking twice when reading this because \"just persevere\" is such common language that many of us are told growing up, and the truth is that perseverance on it's own just doesn't do a whole lot.",

I don't mean double click their photos on instagram, I mean find ways to be where they are and live how they live as much as possible.

You'll also learn how they get their money (and people and robots etc) to work for them. \n\nIt's hard to do, and I'm not recommending being some con man pretending to be rich or a leech on rich people, but there are ways to get in the good graces of wealthy people and learn and earn from them.",

A great time to build a business that caters to consumer excess. Peace. \n\nNow we\u2019re at war. Almost everyone, regardless of stature, is having an existential crisis. They are at level 2 of the Hierarchy; fear of health, wealth, and security. If they have it now, there\u2019s a non-zero chance it could all be gone a year from now.\n\nIf you\u2019re not about to start a business that unlocks the cure for Covid, it will be incredibly difficult to raise capital, let alone have anyone pay attention to it. All VC is being reallocated to biotech and virtual tech because that\u2019s where any signs of growth are.\n\nWe are all incredibly distracted. And will be for a year. \n\nMuch of what is said in OP simply no longer applies. The world doesn\u2019t work that way any longer.\n\nIt\u2019s not just me saying this. Naval agrees, and says he\u2019ll be revising it as things unfold.",

I feel like I\u2019ve just been scrambling to get out of a hole for a few years, my mental health got me to the point of a suicide attempt, and from there I lost my job, had a child who I don\u2019t get to see due to a toxic mother. So I\u2019m always chasing my tail, the only thing I have is the music I make, which I suck at marketing even though I have a great following on Instagram etc, I had 2 great jobs lined up, one with a second interview scheduled, and the other with a job offer on the table pretty much, that was redacted due the pandemic, things will hopefully change soon but I\u2019m not doing great money wise, I will take your advice on board though!

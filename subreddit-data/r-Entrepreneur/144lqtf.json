    "postText": "Recently my request for time off for a family wedding was denied. I haven't worked at this company for long but I know that it isn't my dream to move up the corporate ladder. I have always had and entrepreneurial spirit and I think this is the last straw. Call me entitled but family is important and vacations are important. Lately I have been wanting to start a simple small business that I could possibly scale into a larger regional business and I think that selling hot dogs on the corner is going to be the first thing I try once I quit. My plan is to take a month off and take a road trip around the United States for month or two and then I will pick a town that I liked from my trip and start my hot dog cart in that area because right now the city I live in (Austin, Tx) is insanely expensive and crowded and I want to try a new place. I will be starting with no connections but I have the work ethic and drive to do well so I think I will be fine. I am interested in the hot dog cart business because there is a fairly high profit margin and there is not the need for insane qualifications like starting a law firm or something related. I am no lawyer but I know how to stay positive during rough times and push on. I would appreciate any feedback you have. Thank you.",

Each town/city you set up in has their own set of regulations and permits needed to sell food, which are costly. \n\nI highly recommend reading into what permits are needed in Austin first to get an understanding of the business you are looking to get into.\n\nI would also check into the requirements needed to set up shop in parking lots/sporting events. These establishments simply don't just allow you to sell food without permission and them likely getting a cut of your revenue.",

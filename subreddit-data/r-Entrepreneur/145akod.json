    "postText": "I live in Canada. I don't want to start anything coding or app related. I love working with plants and vegetables. I don't want to go through the traditional farming route but I also want to commercially grow food that will give me a good profit at the end of the day.\n\nI have always liked the idea of a tech based greenhouse where I can automate the process of humidity, temperature, environment, moisture control, etc. Being that Canada has most of its land in the cold zone, a self controlled green house seemed like an good alternative in and around places where regular agricultural methods won't be able to be carried out. And we have so much of that kind of land.\n\nThe question is with this greenhouse process I know I'll be restricted to a certain amount of crops that I can grow. I was wondering what advice would you have for me where I can do this by growing x and y crops which I can not only supply locally, but I can export as well which would be in high demand. \n\nObviously there are fast growing crops and then there are these like Wasabi, Saffron, Vanilla, etc that take a lot of time and effort to produce but are highly worth it. And not just North American crops but other crops from around the world such as Jinseng and Ashwagandha which again are also time intensive. So I was thinking of primarily starting off with faster producing crops that will have a high demand and then on the side focusing on the longer time taking herbs and crops.\n\nI was also thinking I could source my products both to market and to restaurants as well.\n\nThen there is the question of capital which I am not too sure of how to acquire since doing it out of pocket in this economy would be quite hectic.\n\nLove to hear what your thoughts are. Thank you.",

It's a business that scales easily but that has been done, and you will never win from the big guys.\n\nWhat those don't have; however, is branding and sales, a story, a personal approach.\n\nI think you can make a living by delivering locally as long as you are able to make people prefer your produce over mass produced food. It has been done before.",

Just like yourself, I love growing stuff and engage with nature.\n\nDue to my age, I shouldn\u2019t be starting small and grow over time so my conclusion on a mid-scale operation was:\n\n-It\u2019ll take around $200K to get a decent start. That includes land and greenhouses. Could rent but there is no investment value on renting.\n\n-All feasible crops are grown and cornered by large companies.\n\nOn a smaller scale:\n\n-Farmers markets are hard to get in due to no vacancy and annual leasing spots are very expensive.\n\n-Easy to grow crop market is over saturated.\n\n-Not easy to grow niche products such as ginseng takes 5 years to harvest.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t have the capital, I wouldn\u2019t busy my mind with what crops or try to obtain a business loan without a business.\n\n-Growing mushrooms for local restaurants is interesting though.\n\nThis is based on US and best of luck friend.",

I'd recommend doing some research and reaching out to local organizations that can offer advice and resources to get you started. Additionally, there are some great online resources such as SCORE and the Small Business Association that can provide guidance and answer any questions you may have. For me honestly what made a huge difference and helped me go further fast was to have a consulting coaching me the way. Good luck on your journey!",

If you do a quick search for books in this sub, you\u2019ll get lots of great recommendations. The more you read, the better perspective you\u2019ll have on what kind of business to start and how to make it work.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d recommend Emyth and Competing Against Luck to start with, but there are many others worth reading.",

We live in Canada - Indian and Pakistani mangoes are selling today for $40(12 pieces) because mangoes are imported from these countries and they have low shelf life. First yield of mangoes takes about 3 years and we have also bought mangoes from people's garages because they sell it for $30 as opposed to the $40 at grocery stores..\n\nWhile everyone else's ideas are valid I would look into growing tropical fruits which we import as Canada has only immigrants and we are all from Indian subcontinent.",

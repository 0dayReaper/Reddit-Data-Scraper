I read about a site where if you have a startup that's in need of a cofounder with compimentary  skills, or you are looking for a new startup opportunity - you can find and explore potential opportunities. I beleive it may have been a type of startup/venture studio that actually helped make this happen.\n\nRing any bells to anyone? ",

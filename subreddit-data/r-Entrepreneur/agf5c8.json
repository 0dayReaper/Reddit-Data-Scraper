    "postText": "I've been deep cleaning restaurants for about 5 years. Every now an again I post to this subreddit and show you guys some of the services I offer to my customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRestaurant floors get very greasy on a fairly regular basis. They need to be deep cleaned to stay safe, and keep the appearance of the environment at an acceptable level. Plus they also stink, when they are dirty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts interesting because not many people even know this kind of business exists and its a huge niche with tons of opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I made a video that shows how I clean restaurant floors](https://youtu.be/6RgG3cBUf2E)\n\nTypically I charge $.60 per square foot. It usually comes out to no less than $100 per hour, and my supplies/overhead is almost nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just thought some of you might want to take an inside peak into a business that provides services offline. And I want people to know that you can still make a great living for yourself if you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do some dirty work.",

The title is something like \"Making $1000 per night cleaning restaurants\"\n\nI just try and guess how long it will take me then I multiply it by my hourly rate, which is $100 per hour. I don't tell the customer that is the rate, I just give them the total price. Most of the time I'm pretty exact because I've been doing this for a long time. If I underbid, I'm usually okay with it and its not a huge deal as my costs are so low and I get tons of business. But If I way overbid a job, I'll typically make the correction and tell the customer that I bid too high.",

Basic cleaning is tough to justify contracting out, but I think it's pretty easy to make a case for contracting out an occasional deep dive. It's probably not the type of service I'd go seeking out, but with the right sales pitch and price (don't think i'd pay anywhere near $.60/sqft) I think I could be talked into it.\n\n",

Timing would also help. If you caught me in the spring after spending 6 months chasing salt buildup in the dining room I'd be more interested.\n\nIn my brand, it's pretty fractured between 1-2 unit fzs and big multi-unit (10+) companies. I'm guessing it's going to be hard to either dislodge an existing service provider in multi-unit companies, or get them to buy into servicing what may be perceived as minutia if they don't already have a provider.

You want to make your current customers as happy as possible, while getting lots of good leads out. If you can increase margins per client, it'll make expanding later a _lot_ easier, and it'll also make selling your business a lot more lucrative.\n\nMaybe later as you expand, you can promote your best workers that really have an eye for getting it done right so you can take on more clients.\n\nI _really_ like your focus on quality. Keep it up!",

Service businesses are the way to make it big. I bought a $3k cargo van off craigslist in 2011 and this past year we serviced 10,000 customers and made $3MM in revenue. So many entrepreneurs focus on dropshipping and tech startups when the odds are so slim and the competition is so strong.\n\nIf you are willing to get out and sweat and work you can create a scalable company and the opportunities will only grow as you gain momentum. Of the 20 friends in college working to start tech companies none of them hit it big and they all have jobs now. Its a shame.\n\nIts my 2019 goal to get more people to focus on this area of entrepreneurship so I started a [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-sweaty-startup/id1445260221?mt=2) and [blog](http://sweatystartup.com/) telling my story and sharing everything I've learned.",

My question for you is how did you go about discovering these janitorial companies: what combination of Google, white pages and so on did you use? Further, when did you decide to stop searching or what made you comfortable in selecting Victor as your mentor? Did he pay you much more than minimum wage or did you operate as an intern of sorts?  \n\n\nSorry, I know this seems a bit much but I want to start making calls and these questions are nagging me.

Once I decided that I was going to start, I just made a big list of all the types of companies I could start. I analyzed my list, one by one until janitorial stood out.  I didn't really \"Select\" Victor, I was just desperate to learn my new trade and I would have worked for anybody for any wage.  He just happen to take a liking to me. I worked for minimum wage, but it was only for a few months and my wife worked full time to support us for a long time while I got started.",

I have memories of being a child watching my dad do this then learning from him when I was about 15. I went on to help him do this into my early twenties. I stripped, waxed, and buffed floors probably thousands of times (I try not to think about how many times I\u2019ve cleaned a toilet). I am now a software developer in my mid thirties and look back at that time fondly. Anyway, all the respect and thank you for teaching the world. ",

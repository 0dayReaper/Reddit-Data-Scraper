    "postText": "*Reposting as my first attempt was unsuccessful*\n\n*Posted this on /r/GetMotivatedBuddies but then thought I might have better matches here*\n\n-----\n\nI need to get more focused on making prospecting calls everyday. If you're self-employed or a business owner, you know we can't survive without new clients. \n\nI used to be very good, making 2-8 appointments a day. But after hitting multiple bumps on the road the last few years, I'm barely making 1-2 a week. Your issue doesn't need to be the same as mine, but we should be aiming for the same goal: personal business growth!\n\nIf you're an entrepreneur who's interested in something similar, hit me up. I'd like to schedule a 5-10mn call at the end of everyday. We talk about what we did, how it went, and what we're planning tomorrow. \n\nI'd like it to be at least an audio call, but ideally video call. I feel it has more impact. I'm on EST timezone.\n\nIdeally, you read this article: \n[Ten Guidelines for Working with An Accountability Partner](https://www.getmotivatedbuddies.com/ten-guidelines-for-working-with-an-accountability-partner/)\n\nI can speak English, French or Spanish.",

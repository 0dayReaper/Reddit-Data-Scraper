    "postText": "Without writing an essay, my partner and I just took the leap of faith. With careful consideration &amp; planning, we\u2019ve put forth some of the major investments we deem necessary to take our exterior remodeling company from $3.6mil~ annual gross to $10mil+\n\n$300k upfront that will hopefully propel us into that next tier. We\u2019ve done all the metrics, all the research, and believe we have the perfect team to ensure proper execution. \n\nIt\u2019s nerve-wracking. We\u2019ve been able to comfortably make $150-200k/year each, and if this fails we\u2019ll ultimately end up out of business. If it works, we should be able to become very wealthy. \n\nHe has a kid on the way, and I have a 16 month &amp; a newborn. Unfortunately we have to spend less time with our family to make this dream a reality. Hopefully it pays off. Godspeed.",

I am looking to meet more likeminded people, as I don\u2019t know anyone who is entrepreneurial or doesn\u2019t work 9-5, etc. It would be nice to speak to people who understand the challenges and so on. \n\nDoes anybody know of any good events or networking groups in south east England, specifically for entrepreneurs or young business owners? \n\nMany thanks in advance!",

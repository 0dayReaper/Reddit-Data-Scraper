They took zero outside money from start and used their own funds, as many truly successful entrepreneurs do.",

People paid in advance, and I built PC's for them, setup networks, etc... Then I made a deal to provide support for a small ISP in exchange for selling PC's out of their office space. Every cent of profit went to buying inventory and I continued to market on the cheap, fliers, word of mouth and asked all of my customers to tell their friends and colleagues, I setup a referral program as well as taught myself code to build websites in my space time.\n\n1 year later I bought them out. I now own several businesses that I've either purchased or built out from scratch based on an idea or need.",

Many people here (and elsewhere) will tell you that for a business to be \u201csuccessful\u201d, it NEEDS initial investment cash to get things off the ground. It just isn\u2019t true. This is horse shit. \n\nIt does depend on things like what kind of business you\u2019re setting up, how many people are involved, what kind of industry the business is in, whether it is product based or service based, etc. \n\nBut let me tell you that many businesses are started with little to no cash all the time and they go on to do well and \u201csucceed\u201d. Provide excellent service and do a good job for your customers/clients and the money will follow.\n\nLet me reiterate: the majority of businesses (even those that become very successful) in the world start with little to even no investment money. Start with what you already have and devote your time, energy and love to your business and believe me, the money will follow.",

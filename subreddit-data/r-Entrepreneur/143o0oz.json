    "postText": "I posted last time about how I was going to start posting on my business page on tiktok soon and today officially marks 1 week since I started and I have 110 followers and 15 email list signups. \n\nMy tiktok view count was sitting between 200-500 views on some \u201cPOV \u201c and \u201cRelatable\u201d content post with trending audios. The ones that were/are doing the best are when I stitch videos of popular creators in my niche, talk about their problem, and how I\u2019m the solution. Once I noticed that I spent last night making 3 videos to disrupt the content schedule I had made the weekend prior. Two stitch posts and one reply to a comment. So far today I\u2019ve posted 2/3 of this videos 2 hrs apart and they seem to be doing well. \n\nStill working on my tiktok Seo. I try to say my keywords, put them in the video text, caption, and hashtags but in the search bar above the video it still says \u201cfind related content\u201d which means that tiktok still doesn\u2019t really recognize where to push my video. \n\nNeed to add a size chart to my website and a return policy. I\u2019ve added an app to Shopify that would allow me to disable my password but not allow anyone to purchase product. Instead everything is noted as out of stock and the Ly can sign up to be notified when their chosen piece drops. I think this is great because it allows them to really see the product, price, and size options and gauge for themselves early on if they plan on purchasing. It also lets me know that anyone who signs up is likely to purchase on launch day bc they\u2019ve already decided it. \n\nSee you in a week!",

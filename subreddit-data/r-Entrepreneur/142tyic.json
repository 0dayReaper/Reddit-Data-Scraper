    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI'm one of the top salesperson at a big insurance company. I want to make a change and work for myself. How can I use my sales skills to start my own business? I'm considering white labelling a product or service and selling it under my own brand through cold calls and emails.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. Have any of you successfully transitioned from being an employee to an entrepreneur using your sales skills? Any tips?\n\n2. What products or services are good for white labelling and selling through cold calls/emails?\n\n3. What challenges should I expect when starting my own venture? Any lessons learned to share?\n\n4. Can you recommend any resources to improve my entrepreneurial and sales skills?\n\nAny advice appreciated!",

            "comment": "I have transitioned from sales to entrepreneur. The #1 piece of advice I can provide is that sales is the easier part of the job. The hardest is marketing - getting interest with no brand, little to no cash, and minimal experience is a way harder road than I ever imagined. An incredibly rewarding one once you figure it out. A successful entrepreneur told me that when I first started, and I thought \u201cthis guys a dumbass\u201d if I can sell I can sell, but I learned over a few painful years how right he was. That\u2019s not to dissuade you, sales is a great/necessary skill for an entrepreneur, but be prepared to fail and be prepared for it to take years before you see income, let alone similar income to what you\u2019re seeing today as a top sales rep. \n\nGood luck!",

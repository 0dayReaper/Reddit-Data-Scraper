Apple has successfully niched into a luxury brand figuring there\u2019s more than enough people who\u2019d pay $3499 for a headset or $6999 for a base model Mac Pro for them to run their business at volume. \n\nResist niching down on gender. Because that dangerously sounds like \u201cI\u2019ll make it pink\u201d. You alienate your target niche immediately.",

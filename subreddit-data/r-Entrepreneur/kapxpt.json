But I think because it's from different universities, different programs it's kinda overwhelming and overkill. \n\nIf you want to learn to program then MIT's curriculum has strong fundamentals, and if you want to quickly brush up some CS skills and if you want to review something - OCW is best, they have some wonderfull collection of lecture notes along with assignments and exercises.\n\nSome courses from MIT are pure gold, SICP lecture series are timeless. And I think it's more cohesive to have everything on one site, you don't have to login to all of this sites and follow the exact structure, you can modify you curriculum as you wish there's hundreds of courses on any topic.\n\nJust my 2 cents",

At undergrad level you don't interact much with top faculty directly, because they have a lot to cram into each class and there isn't much time for Q&amp;A or pondering the latest in research. It's all standard curriculum, no different than is taught anywhere else, just done at a much faster pace because even the slowest student in the room still nearly aced their SAT's and will understand it pretty quickly.   \n\nI think that's the main academic value either at MIT or other top schools, just how much they can cram into the undergrad years. Most students at MIT for example complete Differential Equations by the end of their freshman year, compared to sophomore or junior year at other schools. That's a key prerequisite to a lot of advanced engineering and physics classes, so by your senior year you might be taking things that are taught at the graduate level elsewhere.\n\nBut self-paced video courses? I don't think you'll learn any more or less with MIT's courses than any other school's video curriculum. In fact it may be worse, because without the pre-class textbook review, lecture, then recitation classes where you really get to ask questions and go over homework problems in detail, the lectures will probably seem like way too much information too fast. \n\nAnd motivation is a huge issue with video classes. Without the pressure of being graded at the end and *really* needing to learn it, I'd be way too tempted to let complicated topics in the video-only lectures just fly over my head, and also blow off the four hours a day of problem sets and homework. You're accountable when you're paying tuition and attending actual classes, versus watching videos at your own pace on the internet. I can't see how it would be anywhere near the same experience, in my opinion.",

Just received \"well, the quiz is due soon\"... \n\nI'd advise any new programmers to find someone in the real world, or a kind patient person on the internet, that they can bounce questions off of. \n\nIt was a heart breaking experience.\n\nHopefully this is newer, and put together that someone who knows how to teach and also cares about their students.\n\nAnyway, thanks for making this. You'll have at least changed the outcome of one person's life positively...which is, to me, the most important thing one can do. Hopefully you have many of these \ud83d\ude01",

This comprehensive list is great for someone like me who wants to do it on their own but has no idea what to start with. Having everything laid out so nicely, broken down into semesters is amazing. I am going to use this. Thank you.",

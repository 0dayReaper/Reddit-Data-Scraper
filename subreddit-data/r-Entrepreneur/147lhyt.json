Every time you take a short cut to save yourself time, something inevitably goes wrong and you end up having to spend additional time fixing the mess you caused before actually doing the original task correctly. \n\nFor example, you need to take a bottle of wine off the top shelf. You could get a step ladder and take it down safely... or you could just stand on your tippy toes and scoot that bottle forward with your fingertips enough to grab it and take it down. \n\nBut of course that's the lazy way, and you're not nearly as coordinated as you'd hoped, so the bottle tips over and sends three more bottles crashing to the ground with it. Now, not only do you have broken glass and wine to clean up, but you have to go get the step ladder anyway to get the last remaining bottle that's too far back to reach now.   ....The lazy man works twice as hard. \n\nEnjoy this one as it haunts your brain for the rest of your days. But it's honestly a truly valuable lesson and ties directly into the second best piece of advice I've received...\n\n\"If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well.\"",

But that wasn't really advice.\n\nSomething of late, also strictly speaking not advice: \"I don't have to be right, but I have to be correct\".\n\nTo me that really stod out because I've never really framed it like that, and I think that the simplicity of it makes it very powerful in heated arguments. It disarms a confrontational position in favor of a more shared one.",

    "postText": "I have an app prototype on Figma with UI/UX kits and I\u2019m not sure what to do next.\n\nMy goal would to be to work on an MVP next, but I don\u2019t have the coding experience that\u2019d accomplish anything that figma cannot. Teaching myself to code well enough to make an MVP would take a longer than finding an experienced coding partner for this specific app. \n\nI feel my best choice to find a TCO through asking other coders for feedback on the prototype. That way I get feedback on the prototype while also scouting for potential business partners, killing two birds with one stone. \n\nI\u2019m here to look for any advice from people who are knowledgeable about this process and if this is the best route to take.\n\nAny advice on what I should do next would help me out a ton!",

            "comment": "One option would be to use a no-code development platform like Bubble or Webflow. They allow you to create apps without coding.\n\nHowever, I would first make sure that there will be real demand for your app. Have you any possibility to pre-sell it, e.g. on Kickstarter or the like? Or create a landing page and connect it to a payment form on Lemon Squeezy?\n\nIf you can make some sales like that, you will know that people want to buy. Without such a confirmation, you build into the dark.",

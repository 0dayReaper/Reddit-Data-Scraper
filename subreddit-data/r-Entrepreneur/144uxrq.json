    "postText": "I probably have a few ideas, but in business can you make every idea you have work? Or is it only about opportunities and lack in the market. They say you have to solve a problem but theres no problem that doesn\u2019t already have a solution you could probably just make it better. Also is it about passion or just about making money: I feel if you want to make every business idea happen it\u2019s not possible as there\u2019s time for everything and business takes avg 5-7 years to be successful. That'll be a lot of time invested if you dont choose what?, wisely. Dont want to end up with failed businesses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidenote: what's the best way to earn capital? that's not funding with debt. is debt viable?",

            "comment": "Your post touches upon many issues and myths, and it depends on a lot of things.\n\nCan you 'make' every idea work? This seems straightforward but goes from Theranos and the Elizabeth Holmes conviction to a recent post which involves [Great Man theory](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-great-man-theory-of-leadership-2795311) applied to business and onto *fake it til you make it* culture.\n\nWith enough money, lots of questionable ideas can be made to seem as if they are viable when they are not. Plenty of companies exist solely to get funding and burn money, they don't do well at the end of economic cycles when investors evaluate their portfolios.\n\nGreat man theory argues when the pressure is on a great leader will emerge. I'm not going to go into this one too much, but it's bullshit no matter how you approach this issue. Trial and crisis do not make character, they reveal it. And there is a crucial element in success called timing, equal parts chance and sound judgement that pisses off both the 'success is all luck' crowd and the boot-strappy 'every man an island' camp.\n\n[The single biggest reason why start-ups succeed | Bill Gross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpx7gpSqbY)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;They say you have to solve a problem but theres no problem that doesn\u2019t already have a solution you could probably just make it better.\n\nSounds like pre pandemic thinking to me, but okay ... we'll go there. Think of the world as in a constant state of flux, with change as the constant. What used to work so well may no longer get the job done. And don't even get me started on the 'solutions industry' who only solved the problem of which lame excuse to use when shoving out an application. There are problems aplenty, and the people here should consider it a referendum on their future in entrepreneurship that [they can't find one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/94qdvy/what_are_your_tier_1_problems/e3n07ve/). I wrote [Problem Curation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMyIdea/comments/j7kar8/problem_curation/) for anybody who isn't in the \"Everything has been invented\" camp.\n\n&gt;Simply put, CRM systems can't do what companies need them to do. Today, companies turn to CRM systems as literal cloud-based spreadsheets of deals in the forecast. However, what companies need is a system of record that tracks activity data and provides information on what actions should be taken to maximize the chance of closing a deal as won.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;CRM systems lack those capabilities, so a new approach to maximizing customer data is developing based on powerful advances in artificial intelligence, storage and computation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why Customer Relationship Management Systems Will Become Obsolete Within 10 Years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Aye-Eye' nuts, this is your clue. Electricity is a modern wonder, no? Many popular books on entrepreneurship, yet startup failure rates never budged. And now launch monkeys, you have your very own clue as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;That'll be a lot of time invested if you dont choose what?, wisely. Dont want to end up with failed businesses.\n\nThe people just 'taking the leap' are not in agreement, apparently. Wisdom just isn't in demand these days, sad to say. Care and due diligence are collateral damage and to look before one leaps is just [not going to be done](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/mupm4w/comment/gv8mh4q/?context=3). So you got one roughly right, kudos.\n\nYour post is a wonderful discussion starter with many intriguing issues within it. Pity there won't be any interesting discussions from it.",

I find it interesting, wish I could engage you in discussion on this but what do I know? \n\nyoure saying theres a lots of myths about business...I agree.\n\nare there any examples of businesses that aren't viable but with a lot of money they made it work? (I once heard that all businesses should be able to be sold to another person/entity and if you can't sell its not a good idea)\n\n`-`There are problems aplenty, and the people here should consider it a referendum on their future in entrepreneurship that they can't find one. I wrote Problem Curation for anybody who isn't in the \"Everything has been invented\" camp. - (not sure how u quoted me)\n\nI think everything has been done in all honesty, popular saying that theres nothing new under the sun, and every problem that is available is as age old as time itself the more are born and people die we'd have to solve their problem which is where utility comes in, youre helping others(each new person you come in contact with) with your idea. if problems have been solved then the world will be perfect.\n\na CRM system can't probably do that because its not a human being, yes theres AI, but a system can't factor in all the variables and if it can its because it was fed to it. one varible could change today as you said the world is in constant flux so its pretty hard to have those systems. its like a machine that can accurately predict the weather, its not possible. only forecasts are.\n\n'Aye-Eye' nuts, this is your clue.

You not only declared a industry non existent, you contradict yourself.\n\n&gt;They say you have to solve a problem but theres no problem that doesn\u2019t already have a solution you could probably just make it better.\n\nWhy make it better at all if there is no problem? While the general expression of nothing new under the Sun may have some philosophic merit, business success rests upon the specifics.\n\nHowever, just because you can't come up with anything doesn't mean there is nothing to come up with. There's a much simpler alternative nobody wants to consider.\n\nThis may simply be a bad case of [Blue Ocean Tragedy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMyIdea/comments/dd4rce/blue_ocean_tragedy/).

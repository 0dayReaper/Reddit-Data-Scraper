    "postText": "I had this debate with my friend. I told him that his 9-5 stuck with a boss that decides where he is when he wants was kinda sad. He called me delusional to think that having a business is not a big part of luck.\n\nI think that saying that it's mostly luck is stupid. I had some lucky parts to my business (like finding my biggest contract was just because of one my client was a close associate of someone with a bigger business), However, he would never have referred me to his other client if I hadn't done a really good job for him first. Sure, I was lucky he had a friend like that, but I would have never unlocked this opportunity if I was bad at doing what I do. \n\nWhat do you think about that? How much of your business is PURE luck vs skills and hard work?",

Very few truly \u201cself made\u201d rags to riches entrepreneurs in the world. \n\nThe fact is no matter how many times the gurus say that you just need to change your mind set and work harder to become rich, it is not possible for society to function like that. Majority of the population must remain average or else our economic system would collapse. Even if everyone gets better off the rich will still have access to the greatest in life while the working class and poor will work away. \n\nIf everyone has equal ambition, work ethic, talent, and skills it would still not allow for everyone to be rich. As more and more people try to become wealthy, competition and scamming increases drastically. \n\nIt almost certainly is a combination of genetic factors, how you were raised, your families income level, and your access to upper class social networks. Almost all the \u201crich\u201d people in my city have rich families and were able to fail time and time again. Some just bought a bunch of boats and yachts and charter them. Now they are rich too. Some invest in startups with family money. These are who 90% of the rich people are. Again as more people get wealthy the more inflation on luxury goods and then basic goods increases. This brings everything back to rich, working class, and poor (which some classes in between). The people that do go from zero to hero definitely have some natural abilities to succeed. Whatever chemistry us business minded people run on is now how the general population thinks.",

The fifth company that I started 7 years ago is consistently doing eight figures in revenue with eight figures net profit and I have no employees and I control my niche of the commercial truck parts market for North America and soon to be the world.\n\nDid I get lucky no. I'm matured over the 25 years. I built skill sets that are very highly developed with hands-on real world usage. I learned traits like aggressive patience, pain pivot, leverage, real delayed gratification, severe discipline, consistency, and as my value increased I was able to transfer that value to the marketplace and that's all the marketplace rewards is value.\n\nI've always listened to the MFCEO project, Jim Rohn, Les Brown for years, and now I found that I really really enjoy Alex Hermosi.

We were only able to last so long because we did everything right plus more. \n\nAnd before anyone says \u201che could\u2019ve researched the area\u201d, it\u2019s trickier than that, there\u2019s just no way to know 100% how an area will respond to your business. In this case, this area was just bad luck for the owner. If 6/6 attempts worked in your favor, you\u2019d be stupid not to take a gamble at something that had almost a 100% success rate. But that\u2019s just life, you win some, you lose some. Some people end up losing at the beginning so they don\u2019t move forward.",

The other guy succeeded because he was lucky, but we failed because we were unlucky. Luck becomes a scapegoat that prevents us from taking personal responsibility and looking inwards to ask ourselves, \"is there anything I could have done differently or better?\"\n\nI reject the notion that anything external will hold me back from greatness. If I don't make it, it's because of me.\n\nAnd, if you look at the research around entrepreneurial success, you will overwhelmingly see that this characteristic, an internal locus of control, is more prevalent than any other... so if you include luck as another critical factor, then the logical conclusion seems to be that only people who believe in their ability to drive their own success get lucky.",

If you're willing to A) learn and B) work hard you can probably make a decent success of any business. A) learning what to do in business is harder than most people think. BUT anyone who's a huge success has had some luck, timing, breaks. But they knew enough to take advantage of them. Warren Buffett calls this being a member of the lucky ovary club - and says he's lucky he was born in a time and place where his natural skills would pay off financially. \n\nEven when you get lucky you need to take advantage of it. \n\nAlso people who consider themselves lucky notice and take advantage of more opportunities than those who think it all comes from their efforts. The study that showed this postulates that opportunities happen to everyone, but not everyone notices or takes advantage. \n\nGood Luck!",

(two links provided later reference studies which range from 30% luck to as high as 90%)\n\nPutting in the legwork can help mitigate a lot of luck, but I wouldn't say the majority.\n\nPart of the issue with the whole \"bootstrap, self-made-man\" fantasy is the sheer number of things we don't notice that play an impact on our ability to succeed at any given task.\n\nBeing born into a reasonably wealthy country. Being born into a reasonably wealthy *part* of that country. Being born into a reasonably well-off *family* within a reasonably wealthy part of a reasonably wealthy country.\n\nAll of that plays an astronomical role in whether or not you're successful because all of that is ***directly*** tied to how much educational opportunity you get. And we haven't even gotten to the business yet.\n\nAfter all that, there are other environmental factors (even if you're from a middle-class upbringing in a wealthy country, your parents might get into an accident killing one and leaving the other unable to care for themselves. You may have to become their permanent caregiver. You're not running a business- or you have to sell/close the business you already have). When you finally get to the business, there's a ton of luck there too.\n\nYou have to pick a product/service that *will be* in demand by the time you're actually setup, which isn't a given. Socioeconomic factors can uplift or shoot you down here. Shit, if you decide to start selling X, you may coincidentally be competing against a major corporation that happened to start offering X in your area at significantly lower cost (because they're able to afford undercutting smaller businesses) at the same time. Then you're fucked.\n\nOr the product/service you're offering suddenly got less popular (a ton of businesses died during the pandemic because they offered in-person services that were low on profit margins and couldn't afford to have a dip in revenue). Or a competing service got *more* popular. The company that owns Zoom became a billion dollar company overnight with the pandemic. They couldn't have predicted or accounted for that when they were getting started.\n\nYour service/product could be an excellent idea that's more beholden to market shifts since it relies on discretionary income and the economy happened to hit a recession. Bam, suddenly you're out of the game. Sometimes, you can predict a recession like that, but sometimes the housing market bubble pops because of what hedge funds were doing behind closed doors and it wasn't reasonably plausible to predict it (or its consequences) accurately.\n\nOn top of *that*, you have other environmental effects. What if you have a great restaurant that you just started and poured your heart into, but in the second month, a nearby protest turns into a riot and people end up smashing your windows and stealing your business' stuff. You file a claim with insurance, but they're slow to handle it (or fucks you out of the claim entirely) and in the meantime, you can't operate the business, so you go in the red and you just can't quite recover fast enough to stave off bankruptcy?\n\nOr you're the sole proprietor with no other employees and you get into an accident that leaves you needing to take a medical leave, but your business simply accrues debt during that time.\n\nHard work and smart planning can do a lot to help against bad luck, but it can't do everything, and that's only for people lucky enough to be in the position to start a business in the first place. \n\nhttps://boyerlawfirm.com/blog/luck-in-business-success/\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2021/06/dont-underestimate-the-power-of-luck-when-it-comes-to-success-in-business\n\nIn formal logic, there are what's known as \"necessary conditions\" and \"sufficient conditions.\" Luck is a necessary condition, but it isn't a sufficient condition. You can have luck, but still tank a business for other reasons. But you can't succeed *without* luck.\n\nMeanwhile, hard work and intelligence are *neither* necessary *nor* sufficient conditions. You can just get lucky and bet on the right horse at the right time- even as a lazy, mediocre person. Meanwhile, plenty of hard working and smart people have their businesses pulled out from under them by factors largely outside of their control.",

Take for example handling business development or sales for a firm that simply does not have a well-defined pipeline, or worse, legacy thinking when it comes to senior managers who may not be as adaptable to updating these revenue generating processes.\n\nIn that scenario, luck can play a part when it comes to identifying synergies between the firm and prospective clients which influence the closing of sales or signing of new contracts. Sure, some may define this as a strategy of securing lower hanging fruit and building up a revenue pipeline once such a base is established. But going back to the perspective of someone handling BD in a 9-5 role, luck does play a part and it's probably why attractive commissions are put in place to incentivise hunters to get out there and sell/close.",

I love listening to the answers from various entrepreneurs on the '[How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/series/490248027/how-i-built-this)' podcast when the host Guy Raz asks at the end of each episode, how much of their success is from hard work and how much is from good luck?\n\nI've come to believe that luck, serendipity, fortunate timing, chance encounters, or happy accidents play a huge role in success.\n\nBut not the \"waiting around on the couch, waiting for luck to find me\" kind of thing. People need to get out there, meet new people, try new things, etc. And then, luck seems to find them. In an unplanned way.\n\nMost business strategies can't just be applied and replicated. If they could, everyone would be a successful entrepreneur. If you look at the entrepreneurs who made it, you can trace their success back to a serendipitous moment that made it possible.\n\nOf course, they still had to work hard, make some smart decisions, and take some calculated risks. But it wasn't just hard work or a brilliant plan from the beginning that led to their success.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into this topic, a few resources I recommend:\n\n1. [Mastering Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Uncertainty-Founders-Entrepreneurs-Unpredictable/dp/B0C3FFLVPL)\\- a great new book by Matt Watkinson and Csaba Konkoly\n2. [Happy Accidents](https://happy-accidents.beehiiv.com/) \\- a free weekly newsletter by Dennis Geelen that dives into a different success story traced back to a serendipitous moment",

Entrepreneurship is like that.\n\nFor you, the average guy, trying it the first time, your odds of succeeding are close to zero.\n\nBut what if that NBA guy could practice? Educate himself? What if he got multiple chances? His odds would drastically increase. In fact, I\u2019d even say his success would become inevitable.\n\nAnd fortunately for you and me, the average guys, entrepreneurship is nearly identical.\n\nMy multimillion dollar business started because I got incredibly lucky building a Shopify app when I did\u2026 in 2015. At that time, merchants were migrating to Shopify like crazy, and there weren\u2019t that many apps in existence. For some years, it was a frenzy of installs. I was raking in money, paid off my house, the whole shabang. I made my first half-court shot. \n\nBut before that, I missed the shot\u2026 a LOT. Way more than I could bore anyone with, but none of which were uncommon mistakes for first-timers. Unproven app ideas, wasted marketing money, focusing on the wrong priorities, bad partnerships\u2026 lessons that generally come with experience.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize until later: this is how it works. Not for everybody, but for almost everybody. Your first time shooting that ball, you probably won\u2019t make it. You take a step back, learn from your mistakes, and shoot again.

The founder used to work as an electrician on one sawmill, and another company asked if he could do some electrical cabinets, so he agreed. They started building sawmills and later asked my former boss if he wants to build a full control cabinets systems and he agreed. Later on it moved to wooden pellet factories building and thats where money started pouring in. So was established the company I worked in for 7 years, about 10 mil \u20ac yearly revenue. But the company was depending on one single client, for over 20 years and 90% of the factories built were in russia. Now he's forced to shut down business.\n\nHe got lucky, but eventually ran out of luck.",

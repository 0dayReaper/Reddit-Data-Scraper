When people say give value they mean give general advice on what needs to be done, help people around you and get established as an expert. What that does is it pre-qualifies you to people who don't know you as someone who knows their shit. Gary Vee for all the hate he gets here gets that right, if people see you as someone who knows their shit they will trust without you having to prove yourself to them. \n\nWhat drives value and what makes a customer value one thing over another is a mix of quality and accessibility. \n\nIf you are in the market for web design you will go with the best looking sites, since you want your site to look the best, that are in your price range. \n\nAs a web designer you can do 2 things there - make your site look as good as you can, presenting your values and the way you can help people, and make sure that as many people as possible reach your site. Then you are in the game. \n\nThat example applies to anything. See what the customer's process is when buying whatever you want to sell and make sure that you are there constantly and looking for ways to get ahead of the competition. Play hard to what makes you better. \n\nI hope this helped a bit.",

If you gotta pay to get started see what other people who are doing what you want to did at the start and see to do the same thing or improve their process. \n\nGood luck on your venture man!",

I hope you live a life you\u2019re proud of, and if you\u2019re not, I hope you have the courage to start over again\" Fitzgerald\n\nThe last part really resonates with me. I hope you have a life you are proud of and if not, the courage to start over again. Many people see the ability to settle for a life that they hate as a good trait. I see it as cowardice or subjugation to others in case of family or others with needs. Don't die a coward, hoping to have the life you wish you had.",

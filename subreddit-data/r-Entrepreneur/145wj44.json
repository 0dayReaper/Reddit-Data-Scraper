    "postText": "I'm looking to start a weekly newsletter that shares the top 3 businesses to buy every week. I'll go through bunch of listings and provide the readers what I think are the best buys based on numbers provided on the platform.  \n\n\nI've sold 2 businesses and also been hunting for businesses in the past and know how time consuming it can be so felt like I was almost solving my own pain. \n\nIs this something that PE firms or entrepreneurs looking to acquire businesses be interested in? \n\nIf so I'd love any feedback around the idea and what you'd like to see?",

How will you decide which \u201ctop 3\u201d businesses to feature? What will the criteria be based on? Will you niche down to cater for a certain type of buyer?\n\nYou mention PE firms and entrepreneurs\u2026 these2 buyers would have very different preferences, so I\u2019d assume you\u2019d be catering to one or the other.",

    "postText": "My friends and I started a website development agency and we have about 20 clients that pay monthly.\n\nWe would like to make it convenient for them to pay us but want to avoid the 2.9% fee that stripe and PayPal charge.  What can we do besides ask for payment by check/wire/cash?\n\nWe are open to creating our own payment processor software but we don't know where to start.",

[Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/) is also an alternative but there are send limits as well as it makes the customer log in to pay rather than having monthly billing.",

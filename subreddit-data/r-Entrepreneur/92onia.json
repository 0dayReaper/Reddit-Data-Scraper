    "postText": "I understand this may come off as harsh, but this is coming from a place of deep love and respect - I KNOW how valuable your time really is and I so desperately want you to see this truth for yourself.\n\nYOU NEED SOME MOMENTUM - TO SEE THE DOLLARS COME IN AND CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN DO IT!\n\nIf this post helps one person TAKE ACTION, I will be so happy! There's nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish (or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn!)\n\nTo be frank, there's so much bulllshit online - and soo many of you are complete posers who aren't serious about making money.\n\nYou 'want' to make money (who the fuck doesn't?), but you never take any fucking action. \n\nI want to talk about practical ways to make money NOW.\n\nNot some long ass gameplan..\n\nRIGHT. THE FUCK. NOW!\n\nThis is definitely more geared towards people just getting started.. (As this is how I started my entrepreneurial journey)\n\nPersonally I believe IF YOU'RE SERIOUS - YOU CAN START MAKING MONEY TODAY! (Otherwise you may be bs-ing yourself and being an entrepreneur isn't for you :/ )\n\nI know what I'm talking about. I've sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past 10 years.. \n\nMy path has taken me into a specific niche (anyone here like LEGO?), so I don't do this anymore on this level.. But I still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things - and I believe this is the key to getting started!\n\nHere are some ways I've made money buying and selling over the years..\n\n(And no, I don't want anything from you - I just hope this maybe helps someone get started TODAY!)\n\n'BUY LOW SELL HIGH'\n\nThere are millions of items out there that you can make money on..\n\nEverything has a value.\n\nI have bought many things for less than a dollar that I have resold for hundreds..\n\nFirst of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online..\n\n'HOW DO I FIND ITEMS VALUES?'\n\nSearch 'sold' items on Ebay - and this will show you how much the thing is worth.\n\nDo not look at the current items for sale as their true value. Instead look to see what they have sold for in the past! (Many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold)\n\n'WHERE DO I FIND THINGS TO SELL?'\n\n+ Thrift stores\n\nCheck your local thrift stores a few times a week - take out your damn phone, and pull up the Ebay app.\n\nIf you pick it up, look it up!... seriously! Just Ebay search everything!\n\nMaybe even hundreds of things!\n\nThe most random crap sells for a lot online.\n\nTeacups? Look them up! \n\nOld board games? Look em up!\n\nAction figures? Books? Shoes? Search search search!!\n\nUsually you will want to pay less than $5 and resell for at least $25.\n\nI always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what I was doing - \n\nOver the years I made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell!\n\n+ Yard sales (Oh god I love yard sales!!)\n\nHave a game plan the day before you go out - research and know where you'll be driving. This way you know where to go before you hit the road.\n\nFind community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once..\n\nGet up early!\n\nMy secret to yard sales: Walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is you're looking for! If you're super nice and polite and respectful, many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you!\n\nThis way you can be on the hunt! And you can check WAY more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around! \n\n+ Craigslist \n\nBesides searching for items to resell, try writing a post where you are COMPLETELY OPEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING!\n\nPersonally I think this is a gamechanger.\n\nMake a post under the 'wanted' section - and have the title be something like 'WANTED: Anything, really'\n\nExplain that you sell items online, and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on Ebay. \n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of responses I've gotten for this! The coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on.\n\nPeople respect the hell out of honesty - and they're cool with you making money, as long as you're real with them..\n\n+ Ebay\n\nYou don't have to leave the house for this one!\n\nMake an advanced search for whatever you're looking for - with 'Buy it Now' and 'Newly listed' as the search options..\n\nThis will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale - and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on!\n\n+ Ebay to Amazon\n\nMost people want it NOW! So they ignore Ebay and go straight to Amazon.\n\nBecause of this, most items sell for way more on Amazon compared to Ebay!\n\nYou can list items for sale on Amazon now, and once they sell - head over to Ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer. Everybody's happy and you keep the difference!\n\n*Note: because you never actually see the product in person, you have to be careful with this one. If the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back 100% and take the losa.\n\n+ Alibaba.com\n\nMost likely you've heard of this site. It connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell.\n\nEvery fucking thing imaginable is for sale here, with wholesale prices.\n\nThis is definitely more advanced, but WAY EASIER THAN YOU MAY THINK!! \n\nJust a random example of something you can buy and resell - I found wholesale conveyor belts at $500 each. Here in the US they go for $1800! (There's shipping coats and fees, but the profits are still excellent!)\n\nIt takes time to contact them, ask for samples, and wait for delivery (conveyors for example took 1.5 months to arrive) - but there is BIG money here. I've heard people say 70% of items on Amazon were sourced through Alibaba!\n\nThere are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss, but I just love the simplicity of buying and selling. You can start that TODAY!\n\nI hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started! \n\nPlease please please let me know if you have any questions!\n\n I don't want anything from you  - I just want to be a help! I wish someone would have told me these things years ago when I was first getting started..\n\nLife can be so damn exciting, you just need to see that it's all possible - you need to prove it to yourself.. and you can do that by starting to make money today!\n\nAnyway that's about it..\n\nHave a wonderful mother fucking day y'all!!\n",

            "comment": "I'm happy you posted this - this is exactly how I started. I went homeless at age 20/21 and was basically not doing anything to get out of the situation. I was squatting in a college house of a girl I had met on Tinder. Went to a couple job interviews (dishwasher and salmon processing in Alaska) but never landed anything. My birthday came up and I got $100 from my dad. $75 immediately went back to my friends that I'd borrowed from to keep myself fed and I had $25 left. I spent about 5 hours on a Saturday walking to 3 yard sales in the area. I bought a tennis racket for .50 and an unopened Cranium board game for $1. There was an NES Classic for only $50 but I didn't have the money for it. I wanted it so bad to sell. Anyway, sold the tennis racket to an Arab living in the house, he was so infatuated by the idea of a tennis racket on his wall. I sold it for $5. Sold Cranium on eBay for I think $15 plus shipping.  \n\n\nThat's where it started. I ended up turning this into a full on career for a bit. I didn't have a real job. My weekday routine was to go wait in the line for DI (the Goodwill of Utah) to open. There were about 10 regular flippers. One had a nich\u00e9 in books and had some kind of scanning device. A few had a nich\u00e9 in LEGOs (I later learned why - they remain extremely valuable even after being used). Some had a nich\u00e9 in name brand glasses and clothing. Me? Pretty much anything in the Yard or Collectibles. Board games were my shit though. I could always find shrinkwrapped board games and resell them for great money. I would get versions of Risk and Ticket to Ride for $1 each and they'd sell for $40-$60. Pottery became a bit of a nich\u00e9 for me. Hull and McCoy are the best. If you can learn your pottery, you can edge out competition and make good money because many people don't know pottery and it's super collectible. Decent furniture would work for me if I could fit it in my car - I could usually flip good furniture same day on Facebook. Most notably, barstools in good condition. I once bought a tiny box of glass cartridges of some sort. It was .50 and I had no clue what it was but it was so cheap and I was curious, so I bought it. Turned out to be vacuum tubes for a Fender amp. they sold for about $60 I think.  \n\n\nAnyway, I ended up turning that into a consistent $1,900/month income, which wasn't great, but to only work 1-2 hours per day and enjoy the novelty of learning everything, it's been my favorite job to date (aside from what I do now). Now, I have utilized Alibaba to start my own Amazon store and am pulling about $3,500/wk in profit. Though, to be fair, my main income is from a product I invented and used Alibaba to find a manufacturer. Not a lot of it comes from buying and reselling existing products.  \n\n\nThis is great advice and you broke it down very well, including teaching people how to use the Completed Listings/\"Sold\" filter on eBay to find true price. There's a new Deseret Industries (thrift shop) opening right by my house and I'm considering picking throughout the week just to entertain myself.",

It may not be complicated, but it does require attention. Wouldn't it be better if you didn't have to do this?\n* Support: what if the product breaks or the customer is unhappy? There can be a whole world of pain if you start selling bad products.\n\nMy own story is that I used to do this but I changed my model, and now do Print On Demand products. This involves no fulfilment or quality issues and no support issues either because the platform I use handles everything. Will it scale to $mm pa? No - but it's a generous model if you get it right.

            "comment": "Just a couple of thoughts about this post:\n\n* You absolutely can make money flipping 'stuff' on eBay, but start with a specific amount of money you want to make (say $500 or $1,000) and then deduce the amount you can spend on inventory.  OP is saying you want to get 5-10x ROI (gross) on your purchase, so that would leave us with a $100-200 budget to gross $1k.  I say this because it will keep you honest about the cost/value ratio of the item you are buying.  It's not worth your time to buy a book for $1 to sell it for $5.\n* You have to budget 13% in ebay and paypal fees\n* Make sure you have a dedicated spot to store your inventory, otherwise you end up with a pretty nasty 'clutter tax' - your quality of life at home goes down if you've got eBay shit piling up everywhere (trust me on this, I've sold a lot on eBay)\n* OP doesn't mention auctions, but that's a place to consider after you have established your thrift store/clearance aisle routine.  If you've never been to an auction before, make sure you go to one or two dedicated to NOT buying ANYTHING.  Live auctions can fuck up your reptilian brain and you can overspend / buy things that you can't flip for decent money / leave with shit you didn't need.\n* There area also retail liquidations (like buying Amazon returns), that you can make good 'start up' money on by selling on CL/FB/yard sale etc, but that probably deserves it's own thread.",

Are the competition growing?\n\nYou may be able to grow a business like this, but personally I think you'd struggle to find anyone with the right experience that would work for little enough. If someone is entrepreneurial and has an eye for value, why wouldn't they just work for themselves?\n\nIf you build a business that has a loyal customer base, a strong online reputation and a brand, you should have something of value that protects you from employees just doing their own thing.\n\nGood luck!",

So the first thing that comes to mind would be some themed USB-sticks that no one else is selling (that way you carve out your own niche and be different from all the rest)\n\nHope this helps!",

Black Friday flipping is pretty crazy!

From there it's just a matter of finding them in stock (but warning this pisses a lot of people off - and I don't blame them bc no one likes having to pay extra for a sold out item)",

Even if they couldn't fix them, they could sell them to other people on craigslist for parts. \n\nThey would have competitions of who could get the most/best free stuff off craiglist and a couple of them ended up gathering enough to set up tables at our local flea market. \n\nMaking money this way is definitely plausible.

If it can be resold, I can send you an offer!\n\nI just want to be straight up and honest with you all - yes I will be reselling your stuff! But if you want the cash now, and would rather not have to deal with listing and shipping the stuff - then I'm your guy!\n\nI can offer way more than pawn shop prices, and I'd be willing to buy a whole bundle of your items if you want.\n\nI have up to x$ to spend and I can meet today!

Just be sure it's in high demand!\n\nAs for Amazon - you can easily set up a seller account, and ship from your home.\n\nYou can also send your items to the FBA center ('fulfillment by Amazon') - and that's also way easier than you may think. That's how you get your items on Amazon Prime - which helps them sell faster, and Amazon will handle all customer service and ship the items for you!",

    "postText": "Been experiencing a dry spell since last month with prospects not willing to invest in their video marketing budgets right now.  \n\n\nI've been in the business full time for two years now and this is the driest it's been since I started. If I directly contact prospects they usually say that they do not have the budgets that I share with them (which are not that much tbh - $1.5k to $2k retainers) and Upwork doesn't seem to be working too as it is making some ridiculous changes with their connects policy and most of us just burning money there.  \n\n\nWhat should I do differently to end this dry spell I cannot afford a long slump, unfortunately. I'm confident in the work I do and the value I provide is far better than what I charge for. Any thoughts and suggestions will be appreciated!  \n\n\nFor reference, I work with businesses and agencies to produce video content. [Here's what I do](https://www.johnalimedia.com). ",

He was working on a subscription service for X amount of money a month. \nThe clients can contact him at any moment they want for a certain amount of hours and he'll help them. When they need more hours, they pay the normal price/hour. When they dont need him a lot that month he earns a bit more. \nIt gives him a stable income and clients dont have to wait before they get helped.",

Things in the STEM field are great, but seeing you\u2019re in video marketing, maybe think new apps or new strategies to utilize these apps. I don\u2019t know this space well, so i can\u2019t be too specific \n\nBut for example, creating tick tock and/or reel lengthed snippets scheduled and auto-posted would be valuable to me personally, so i don\u2019t have to social media, which i hate",

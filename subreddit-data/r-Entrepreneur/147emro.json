Have started multiple other small side hustles but really want to get into the online field. I think Ai is a great &amp; interesting tool that will do big things which leads me to the following:\n\n\u2022What is a skill I can learn and build up my skill level with now that I can later utilize, Surrounding the online field like AI, Coding , copywriting , digital marketing etc \n\nI am aware that there are a ton of skills but interested in hearing from other entrepreneurs on what will help set me up for success by building up my skill level.\n\n\u2022On top of that where would I look to get started that is beginner friendly for one of the skills.\n\nIf anything dosent make sense let me know and I can clarify, Thanks fellow Entrepreneurs!",

Like how collaborations happened on shared mainframes decades before the web existed, look at how that grew into the fairly straightforward protocols of the 80s/90s (http, talk, finger, nntp, ftp, telnet, and so on); how today's internet grew more and more complex on top of that.\n\nIf you can follow what happens where in the life of whatever information you're better of than simply understanding single tools, single apps, single APIs, and so on.\n\nSo learn the basics, and try implementing simple things in languages like python and javascript. Like properly from scratch. So you code your own simple web server simply to self host a singe webpage; just to see the flow of information yourself, to understand the protocols and how to read RFCs (the relevant standards).\n\nThis way you'll be prepared to understand how any new technology fits into what exists, and it'll just be yet another new tool for you to use.\n\nAlso, don't forget to understand the people/humans/users/buyers. Tech has no real meaning by itself, it's all about what it does for some people somewhere.\n\nEdit: Get yourself a [raspberrypi.com](https://raspberrypi.com) 4 to use as a server, as well as to learn Linux (CLI).",

I\u2019ve did this recently by introducing ChatGPT into some of my work\u2014 I\u2019m a developer.\n\nI believe if we don\u2019t utilise this technology then we\u2019ll eventually fall behind\u2026 \n\nSO, my suggestion is that you look into AI prompting\u2026 learning how to structure the perfect prompt for the (almost) perfect response will speed up your workflow and potentially get you a job at the end of it.",

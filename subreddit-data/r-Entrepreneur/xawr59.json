    "postText": "So, My wife and I opened an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl food trailer. The trailer is 11x7 and way too small\u2026 the occupancy limit is only 2\u2026 lol \nWe are currently selling out everyday at 2pm, we open at 7am. I am absolutely maxed out on storage space unfortunately so we run out after about 100 bowls and 25 pieces of toast\u2026 \nBeing that it\u2019s only been a month I don\u2019t know if I should wait it out in the food truck for the rest of the year or go ahead and move into a storefront and be able to stay open from 7am to 10pm.. potentially tripling gross sales\u2026 need advice \u2026\n\nForgot to mention that there are no employees yet. Just my wife and I\n\n\nEdit: we have a permanent location in a shopping center\n\nEdit 2: thank you for the awards (I\u2019ve never gotten those lol) also thanks for the awesome feedback and advice I\u2019ve gotten so far\n\nEdit 3: just woke up and am reading all of the comments. I\u2019m blown away that this many people are willing to chime in and give me great ideas. This is the EXACT reason I posted on Reddit! So thank you so much",

There are ebbs and flows to sales.\n\nIf it's your first month, just try to work on establishing your customer base.  You are still in the middle of people figuring out if they like your food or not.",

Whether you\u2019re planning to go storefront or continue with food truck - get feedback, analyze sales - what is selling fastest? which bowl makes you the most money? what are your customers asking for that you don\u2019t have? how can you serve more customers, faster, with the same or better level of service? \u2026etc.\nAgain - be proud, but don\u2019t rush to next steps. Selling out early everyday will generate hype, to an extent, but that hype can turn into \u201cnot gonna bother to go there, they always close early\u201d very fast. Figure out how to stay open longer - price out equipment, hire staff, find a wholesale distributor who can sell you your ingredients for less\u2026 these are your top priorities!",

That's what I see big name acai bowl places do, freeze the key stuff, add whatever liquid and blend. That makes things super efficient and would save prep time during the day and potentially help with storage. \n\nOne thing a local smoothie place found exceptionally helpful was pre-blended fruits. They come in a 5-gallon bucket and save an astronomical amount of time (and are still high quality). That's something to think through as you scale and talk to your food vendor or find one that supplies competitive restaurants. And remember, if you ask Sysco for apples, they'll bring you apples, they may not think about it and suggest a 5-gallon applesauce.",

You want to be maxed out. \n\nTough to say for sure without a full financial breakdown, but restaurants and food trucks max out their profitability when their footprint is maxed out. \n\nSo many busy restaurateurs spend their time thinking 'what if their space was bigger' but there are 10 x that amount wishing their space was smaller because their rent/overhead costs don't give them a chance at success.  \n\nI'd recommend giving it 6 months, and if you're still that busy and the unit economics are strong, open a second location or better yet, consider franchising where you deleverage your risk, and can expand faster.",

There's typically new truck enthusiasm that will be worth seeing if it stays strong or not. I would consider adding some help whether it just be on orders or prep or something to lighten the load on you and your wife so you can spend some time working on the business rather than in the business. And ya see if you can get a restock mid day somehow. \n\nGood for you! Great first month.",

They may be able to store things outside of refrigeration if they are using it in such a short time-frame. If these guys aren't qualified chefs, they may not know a lot of ways to better streamline prep, storage and service procedures. How to better utilise the space etc. \n\nTheir business sounds great, and a lot of great advice has been given.",

Fixed costs (rent) are the enemy of long-term flexibility.\n\n2. Your prices don't feel high for me at all. I wouldn't be surprised if you charged $15 for the bowl, maybe even $18. It's fresh, healthy, and convenient. Since you have more limited avocado toasts, I'd definitely raise those prices first, see if it hits your demand.\n\n3. Having a prep area is a good call however probably doesn't make a ton of sense until you scale to multiple cash registers. You can do the math here. How much would additional labor, additional rental space, additional buildout, additional insurance cost and would you reap that with enough sales to cover the costs?\n\n4. I don't agree with giving out coupons to people to come back later. If you're in high demand, you apologize emphatically and have them follow you on Instagram. \n\n5. Best suggestion I have seen here is a refrigerated van on-site. Another more cost effective idea is to put multiple chest freezers on wheels, get a trailer, and bring two freezers to market with you, while the other two are at home freezing down tomorrow's stock. Come home at night, roll the freezers off the trailer, and roll the second set on in the morning.\n\n6. My last suggestion is to find some more shelf-stable product to complement your lineup that could be sold when you sell out of the acai and avo toast.\n\n7. If you're currently netting $15k a month and you don't see that ending any time soon, I'm not sure why you're in such a quick rush to do anything about it. Don't get conned over by wanting to become a corporate empire. The best handyman or tradesperson does quality work, charges a premium, and maintains a small customer base and can retire very wealthy on that. Focus on your process, sourcing your materials, your labor flow, etc. and perfect it before replicating your operation.",

Can you get someone else to follow it - or buy in pre-prepared food so \"re-stocking\" is a simple matter of sending someone out to a storage unit to pick up more product?

            "comment": "\u2705 My Advice: Build your audience of raving fans and don\u2019t grow too quickly!\n\nCongrats on the big month! That\u2019s a huge accomplishment.\n\nLots of great comments here that I read through so I apologize if some of what I say is redundant. \n\nBut before you expand and grow to a new location you need to grow your audience, and I am not talking on social media. I am talking with an email list that captures at the minimum their name and email in exchange for a future coupon code. \n\nYou can use Aweber for this and the first 500 subscribers are free. They even let you build a landing page for free, and then you put a WR code sign up that directs people to that link to optin. \n\nSimply have them show you the coupon email on their phone on next visit for the discount. Do not over complicate this. \n\nAs someone mentioned above, many will visit you now because you are new and never return. This will help with the engagement. You can also capture their cell phone for texting campaigns later.\n\nAlso, if you build an email list up you can notify them of or when you open a new location. \n\nNext build the audience on social media. Every business starts on social media\u2026HUGE mistake. You are one algorithm shift away from the Social media platforms of having no reach and therefore no audience. \n\nAsk yourself what do the major social media sites ask for during sign up? Yes, an email address and a phone number in some cases. That is the most important data to own. \n\nUse social media, but do not treat it like you own the following because you honestly don\u2019t.\n\nHave the fans you build share their photos and hashtag on social media as that will build buzz locally. \n\nIt\u2019s ok if you keep selling out. \n\nActually everyone wants to follow a winner and wants what they cannot have. So they will really want you more if it always sells out. \n\nExample: There is a local donut shop in the Seattle region that every Saturday opens up for 5 to 6 hours. Lines go around and around the building because people want it. They limit it so the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is STRONG!\n\nUse that to your advantage. \n\nAs many said it is too early to grow and expand. Focus on generating as much revenue as you can now. Go for 12 months straight. See how you can maximize what you have now. If demand is solid for 12 months consider expanding. \n\nFinally, before you get a new location consider documenting your process and create a course teaching others how to build a thriving food truck business like you have! Trust me that will make you a ton of money! \n\nI knew a mobile bar tender that built a course on mobile bar tending and made a fortune! Multimillionaire. \n\nBonus: After 12 months add another truck. Work out the bugs and document. Then consider franchising this out there. (Note: I just saw another poster suggested this too. It\u2019s a great idea! \ud83d\ude01)\n\nYou are doing AMAZING! Keep up the work, and do not get caught up in the temptation ti expand too fast. Learn, test, and grow slowly!",

I would open a second trailer with staff long before I open a storefront (if ever). Why do you want a fixed location? Seems to be a completely different business, and you are only in your first month. Your business might get cut 50% in the winter months, who knows. You haven't gone through one calendar year yet. Making big financial decisions like that kill small businesses every day, don't let it ruin your idea.",

Fortunately, it sounds like a lot of paper products taking up the bulk (non-perishable) goods. You should be able to get a decent size locker for under $100 a month (1,400/month savings plus employees, lights, utilities, permits, etc.). Using your restaurant as storage space isn't a good use of space either and will run less efficient IMO. Basically, it is the worst of both worlds if you want to open a physical location to solve storage. Or perhaps you are buying too much product at once. Unless there is a very good reason to stock up (maybe bulk pricing you are getting?), it doesn't make sense with me. \n\nI thought the whole thing about the trailer was that is a mobile food truck that can go from place to place? Are you stationed at one location?",

I will add this---always be careful before you make big or even medium changes to something that appears to be working. Moving into a storefront could kill your magic momentum and make you just another shop. There is something people like about food trucks, maybe it reminds them of going to the fair or something. Being that you are only one month in, all you should focus on is making those revenues a pattern and keeping your overhead as close to where you are now as possible. Give it six months. Do all the backend support stuff you're discussing here with other people. Have your reinforcements delivered to you during the day by an employee doing work at a different location. I personally don't like the idea of closing down for a couple hours. You're too new and if revenue is that good, you still can't afford it this early on. You need to be banking that money for future growth once you're incredibly established in your market place. Also, commercial leases, even at $1500 can become a ball and chain. Focus on being the food truck a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl market leader. Adding more locations will be easier down the road with another truck and you get to take it with you when you want to go to another location, versus being stuck in a lease with possibly triple net responsibilities as well. Good luck it sounds like you are on to something special and they sound delicious.",

We have been open for 2ish years (opened officially Jan 2020 right before COVID lockdown) and business just continues to grow because we are able to keep overhead costs so low and people love using food trucks for catering these days (businesses, weddings, music festivals, etc).  I recommend keeping up the trailer for at least 6 months-1 year so that you can kind of see how you perform through the slow and busy seasons.    \n\nWhat are you using for storage? Do you tow a truck that has a bed? We have a deep freezer and small commercial fridge that we bring with us and plug into our generator behind the trailer for extra food.  We had shelving installed for tortillas and we also use regular coolers/commercial storage cooler for prepped food.  We had to get very creative w/ extra food and paper goods. So I would recommend getting like plastic bins to hold all paper goods and keep under the counter.  We are able to store about 1000 boats in one plastic tub.  We have wall mounts and caddies for utensils.  If you all don't have the room for any of this then I say close down for 2 hours, reset, and reopen.  We also started off the business w/ just the two of us so I know it is overwhelming.  If you want to chat or need any other advice, please message me! But it sounds like y'all are killing it already!  Good luck!",

Look hard at every (operational) process in your business looking for optimization potential. Once you have achieved that, systemize each process into small steps &amp; areas of responsibility. The development of your proprietary way of doing business, and your systems, often come hand in hand with the process of optimizing your business operations. \nIt helps you to approach the systemization of your business with the goal that it can be handed over, in a turn-key fashion, to a team of employees with minimal training\u2014although never at the cost of customer satisfaction. No matter who is working with or within your systems, to the customers, your business systems should ensure that they always have a great experience. \nOnce you are happy with the results, start doing a lot of research about how big you can or should grow, depending on the results of your research, but also accounting for your vision of your business and life. \nA systemized business will help you immensely with everything from scaling to exiting. \n\n2 Important tips for you and your business: \n- always be due diligent with documentation regarding any and all business dealings\n- only hire people with a high level of trust. If you have to choose between a person with a high skill level but with a low level of trust, or someone with a lower skill level but a high level of trust and integrity, almost always choose the ladder. \n\nThe above is simplified, but it should offer insight into growing and scaling your endeavor. As a last thought, you might not want to be doing this forever. Having a systemized and scalable business also allows you, when the time comes, to exit quicker and likely in a more lucrative fashion.",

Yet I diversified income in buying a business that needed some love and helping save great ideas. Diversify after another 6 months. Handled correctly you are slowly building a franchise.

Eventually, they hired one additional crew and bought one more ambulance.  They were earning 30 to 40k per month and probably clearing a large percentage of that.  They resisted expansion plans for two decades and they retired wealthy, well satisfied with their career choice and happily married.  Expansion isn\u2019t always necessary or even best.  \n\nIn my 27 years as a business owner, I\u2019ve seen many businesses fail, businesses that were succeeding nicely until they became obsessed with expansion.  Just because you know how to do something well doesn\u2019t mean that you know how to run a larger enterprise.  That\u2019s a different skill set and different talent than the thing you started out doing. Expansion may be good for you and your future, but I find that it is often over-rated and destructive.\n\nI would much rather have dinner in a family owned restaurant than a chain restaurant.  Olive Garden is okay, but they will never be anything more than a counterfeit copy of a mom and pop establishment that takes pride in their delicious meals. \n\nIf you do push to expand, do it in very small increments and give each step plenty of time to normalize.  But consider staying small and highly profitable for the long term, it has tremendous benefits.\n\nKeith Waycaster, \nPriority Medical Claims, \nAmbulance and EMS Reimbursement",

To enter their facility your wife and you may need food handler permits from your county or city if you are in the US, if you don't already have them. At bare minimum I'd also explore an umbrella liability policy and forming all this under an LLC. If you haven't already be super careful not to co-mingle funds in your LLC bank account and personal. Post nut allergy warnings everywhere, even print it on the receipts (talk to an attorney about this). Without going into too many specifics ... cash is always king \ud83d\udc51. Bananas can be hell for fruit flies so I'd invest not in a UV bug zapper but a UV bug trapper for your food truck that utilizes a sticky pad. Zappers can't get the smallest of insects and are sometimes illegal to use in food prep areas due to... exploding bugs. If you use blenders of any sort I'd recommend investing in quality Vitamix blenders you can usually buy used off Craigslist for half the cost of new. Have backups of everything. Vitamix vs Blendtec... IMO Vitamix is better because of the smaller base of the blend jar vs the wider base if the Blendtec. Vitamix will blend smoother because it cyclones everything into the blades. Things can get stuck in the corners of the square Blendtec's. If you accept cards make sure you have the newest mobile terminals that support contactless NFC for quick and mobile payments and cellular LTE for authorization back haul. Don't depend on local WiFi.",

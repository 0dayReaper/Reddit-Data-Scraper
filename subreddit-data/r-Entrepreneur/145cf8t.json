    "postText": "I have an air freshener that I\u2019ve come up with. Tested for a year and believe it will be competitive with candles and the like. \nQuestion is, do I manufacture and sell on my own until\u2026\nOr do I come up with prototypes and shop them around to sell the idea. \nReason I ask is 20 years ago I had an idea knocked off in china 6 months after I showed it to someone. I knew it was him and he just laughed in my face. Said, \u201csue me\u201d. \nI haven\u2019t tried to do anything with my ideas since. Just figuring I can\u2019t fight so why get in the ring.",

Coming up with a catchy name that\u2019s tempting to copy is a good strategy, because that solidifies you as the first. For example, lets say you call it Space Fresh, and your packaging is black with galaxies and rockets on it or whatever.  If gets even mediumly popular, you can bet that there will soon be \u201cUFO fresh\u201d or something like it on the internet for sale before long. But you already have your name out there, and then you can put \u201cthe original galaxy freshener\u201d or whatever on your adverts, which will also give you a provenance to trade off. So being first is often better than being cheaper, and not always a product killer. Look how many different cheap types of sticky tape or sticky notes there are, but sellotape and post it are still in business",

            "comment": "Hey there! It's great to hear that you've come up with a promising air freshener. When it comes to deciding on the best approach, it's essential to protect your idea and minimize the risk of it being copied. Consider filing a provisional patent or seeking legal advice to safeguard your invention. Once you have some level of protection, you can explore different options. You could manufacture and sell the air fresheners on your own, building your brand and customer base. Alternatively, you can create prototypes and pitch your idea to potential buyers or investors who may be interested in licensing or partnering with you. Don't let past experiences discourage you. With the right strategy and protection, you can navigate the market and achieve success with your innovative product.",

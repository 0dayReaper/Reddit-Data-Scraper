    "postText": "Okay, listen up peasants because this is going to be BIG!\n\n\nI need developers to build my new app on android and ios. \n\n\nYou won't be paid upfront because I don't have any money. However, if you're willing to think long-term you can become a millionaire because I'll give you 5% equity in the business.\n\n\nSo what's the app? Tinder for dogs!\n\n\nDog owners can help their pet's find mating partners. Simply swipe left to dismiss, or swipe right to sniff the other dog's ass. If both dogs sniff each other's asses, it's a match! \n\n\n\n\n**FAQ's**\n\n\n\n\n**How will the app make money?**\n\n\nWhat are you, a fucking amateur? It doesn't need to make money. We're going to IPO this bitch so that's someone else's problem. \n\n\n\n**Where is the job located?**\n\n\nAt present, you can work remotely because my mom won't allow strangers in the house. \n\n\n\n**What will /u/akpaddy be doing?**\n\n\nI'm the CEO. I will be doing the blue-sky thinking and managing you to make sure you meet my tight deadlines. \n\n\n\n**How will the app get users?**\n\n\nI will speak to a few of my friends who have dogs. After that, we will grow by word of mouth because the app is a awesome. I expect Shark Tank will reach out quite soon. After that, it's pretty much yacht money baby. \n\n\n\nPlease only apply if you've worked for a company I've heard of like Apple, Facebook or Google. If you have knowledge of how to sell user's information for profit, you may also contact me. \n\n\n**Warning: don't rip my idea off or my team of lawyers will hunt your ass down.**",

A design document that at the very least states what basic functionality the app requires and should ideally have mock ups and flow diagrams.\nYou cannot build a house easily without an architects plan, its the same with software. An experienced dev will be able to pick apart the spec and find potential problems and work arounds before any code is written. \nYou want that type of developer unless you have an experienced product owner on board who has written lots of specs before.\nYou should have a spec regardless of whether the pay is up front or in equity.\n\nHonestly I wouldn't want a developer who would be willing to work for equity alone from an advert anywhere near this, any decent dev can get work easily. \nThe type of person to answer an ad like this is most likely struggling for work and not very good. It is always cheaper to spend more to get a decent developer who knows their stuff than to cheap out and deal with missed deadlines, bugs, problems and defects.\n\nSure someone may be able to hack together a quick demo that looks great but what happens if it does kick off? It needs to be scalable, that means decent servers and efficient code. Neither of those come cheap.\nThe alternative is that when it kicks off, suddenly nobody can log in or it takes half a minute to load. That kills the app.\nIf someone hacks your app, thats also game over.\n\nSo for a basic social networking app you are looking at a broad range of skills:\nIOS dev\nAndroid dev\nServer side application code\nServer side database layer\nYou need to think about geolocation, users in Australia will not get a fast connection to a server in Europe. \nSecurity\n\nIts very rare to get someone who can do all that without a lot of reading and research.\n\nAny application that talks back to you needs a server, that costs money aswell. \n\nBe willing to put money towards it or be willing to offer something like 50/50 and be willing to demonstrate you are not expecting them to do all the work. \n\nThen again you may randomly get an experienced skilled dev willing to work for free. Unlikely but you never know.",

My life is complete). \n\nAnyways!  \n\nSorry but I've got to say it...\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time someone said \"my app is going to be big\", I wouldn't be lurking in this sub. \n\nI also want to point out that I find it odd you don't have the money to pay developers to build the app, but have a \"team of lawyers\" that will do whatever it is needs to be done to protect your idea. \n\nWith all that said, I really do wish you the best of luck on this project. It does seem to have a market - even if it's limited to a small neiche. \n\nBut you need to change you train of thought. You're coming across as a bit arrogant. The whole my mom won't let me....  does not instill confidence.  And an IPO?  Im sorry, but I highly doubt people are going to invest in this idea in a way that's going to make you as wealthy as you think you are going to be. In fact, I'm wondering if you know what that even means because once an IPO is launced, you're going to lose a substantial amount of control of ownership you may have in the company more than likely. It means you have shareholders.  And share holders have a say in what happens.  Shareholder (if they make up 51% or more of the companies ownership) have the ability to push you right out the door with a vote and the stroke of a pen. I don't think  they're going to be very interested in a product that has such a limited market. \n\nHave you thought much about how you're going to market this product?  Breeding is very much stuck in the old days where it's a very walled off and elite industry - unless you're targeting the puppy mills. In which case, I really think you need to consider the companies image. You don't want to be associated with such an unethical and inhumane crowd. That won't do well for your IPO when it's discovered. \n\nMaking an app is difficult. I'm going down the same road myself, but I'm learning to code to do it. Good luck, but put a little more thought I to this first, and make sure you have a market for it. ",

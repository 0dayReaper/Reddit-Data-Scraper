I've sent screenshots to those who were naysayers.\n\nI'm currently writing a guide , very detailed on how to start any service based business with next to no money and how to survive and flourish. Is anyone interested?\n\nPm me and I'll have a chat with you and let me know what you're stuck on or what you need help with or what's holding you back from starting a business\n\nAnd when my guide is finished I'll send you a copy.",

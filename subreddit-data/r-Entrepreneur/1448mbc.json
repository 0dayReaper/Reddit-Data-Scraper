    "postText": "Hey all. I recently launched a predictions / pick ems site for the MMA community (UFC + ONE FC).\n\nIt's free to play, solo or with friends. You make picks, there's a leaderboard, whoever chooses correctly the most wins kind of thing.\n\nSo far ads have the best way to get new users. But long term, I'd like to find a more efficient way to get sign ups.\n\nI've tried one influencer and I'll find out what that produces at the end of this month.\n\nI cannot explicitly market this in MMA related forums, subreddits, discords etc due to no self promotion rules. Kills me cause I make nothing on sign ups and it's built for the community. It is what it is.\n\nAny way, I looked at product hunt this morning and I'm wondering if there are any other avenues that you guys think are worth trying. \n\nThis is a side gig so I can only spend the time I have on the side of my 9-5 but I'm definitely open to trying ideas.",

Thanks so much.\n\nI could actually set up a league on behalf of the content creator with an easy link to join for their followers.\n\nThe value prop could be bringing their followers closer together. I can also throw them some cash for the shoutout.",

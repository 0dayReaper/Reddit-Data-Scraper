    "postText": "Hey All,\n\nJake the landscaper again.\n\nAs stated in my earlier posts, I will be releasing little tidbits of information from my upcoming Guide To Starting A Service Based Business.\n\nIn this brief post ill be touching on upselling.\n\nHow to turn a little job into a BIG job.\n\nIt's not like upselling on a website or a brick and mortar store.\n\nYou may get a job come in that you think \"ah it's only $100 for a couple hours it's not really worth my time when I have better jobs I could be doing\". But you couldn't be anymore wrong (sometimes)\n\nReason 1 - There is other work you could do at their property but they just don't know it yet. You need to use your professional opinion to explain it to them.\n\nReason 2 - They can pass on your name to a friend. You start with this $100 job and then their friend engages you to do $10k worth of work.\n\nReason 3 - And this reason happens all the time. The owner will say to me that after my work they are planning to get some concreting done. And I say, oh I can do the concrete if you need a quote for that too. More often than not the client will say yes because they prefer to just use 1 tradesman for as much of the work as they can. It's less phone calls, less logistics, easier to communicate.\n\nThis is why it's important to learn as much about your trade as you can, but also teach yourself other things that you don't do on a daily basis, so if the opportunity arises to do some extra work, you can snatch it up.\n\nYou might get asked to come and do a simple rubbish removal job. There are ways you can turn that small job into a massive amount of work.\n\nI have gone to do a job valued at circa $500 and turned it into 2 months work and 30K Later.\n\nSo as a landscaper, if I go to do a quote for someone who wants some new paving added for example, I'm walking around the whole house while we are talking and i'm looking for other things I can suggest to the client that they could get done (if they have the money).\n\nThese are things could be\n\n\\- Weeds in lawn. Old lawn. Rip it up and replace. Add Kerb appeal to the house.\n\n\\- Dirty driveway, suggest a good power wash.\n\n\\- Rotting deck. Suggest replacing decking boards or building a new deck.\n\n\\- Cracked or sunken concrete. Suggest replacing the lot or attempting to patch it up.\n\n\\- No garden edging seperating garden beds. Suggest installation of edging.\n\n\\- Uneven levels of ground, high embankments. Suggest building retaining walls for erosion control and more functionality of the space.\n\nand so on.\n\nThis is applicable to everybody, not just me, a landscaper.\n\nSay you offer pressure washing and you've only been asked to quote the driveway.\n\nLook for other opportunities.\n\n\\- Dirty Facade\n\n\\- Cobwebs\n\n\\- Graffiti\n\n\\- Mould\n\n\\- Stained Deck / Old timber fence.\n\nSay you're a painter and have been asked to quote painting the bathroom.\n\nSame goes\n\n\\- Weathered fence\n\n\\- Dirty facade\n\n\\- Window sills\n\n\\- Front door\n\n\\- Garage\n\nAlways keep an eye out for a chance to upsell and a chance to display that you're a true professional, even if they don't engage you for the extra work, they will really appreciate the advice as long as you don't push them too hard.\n\nNever assume even though the job description is 2 hours work, that that's all it will ever be.\n\nThanks for reading\n\nIf you'd like to go on the list to be notified about when my guide is released, please comment here or inbox me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

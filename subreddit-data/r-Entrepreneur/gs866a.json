    "postText": "TL;DR. Me and my college buddy took our startup to $323,000.43 in 14 months and we will soon pass $1,000,000 in annual recurring revenue. I\u2019m creating this post to give you a ski lift up the hard-fought mountain of success. I wish someone had done that for me.\n\nThis is how we did it. All cards on the table.\n\n(Read time \\~ 10 minutes).\n\nTurn off your Law &amp; Order reruns. Settle in and pick the [Red Pill so we can go into the Matrix. ](https://imgur.com/a/0SrjT6X)\n\n\\[Important: This post is not intended to sell or promote anything homie. It's my small way of paying it forward to entrepreneurs, a community I deeply care about. Can't be more clear than that.\\]\n\n# What we do\n\nI\u2019m the founder and CEO of **Smart Alto** the easiest way to set 15-minute phone appointments with homebuyers.\n\nReal estate agents advertise homes on Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com and other places. The problem is when homebuyers want to meet with real estate agents to view properties, real estate agents almost never respond to the inquiries because they\u2019re busy doing other stuff.\n\nWe built technology that sends text messages to those homebuyers within 2 minutes, asks them a few simple questions, and then sets 15-minute phone appointments on the real estate agent\u2019s calendar. That way, the homebuyer always gets their questions answered and can then schedule time with the real estate agent to go see the home.\n\nI used to work for a real estate brokerage to set appointments for real estate agents, so I know this problem very well.\n\n# Pulling back the curtain on my startup.\n\nI\u2019m pulling back the curtain on my startup and going to show you exactly what I did to take it from $0 to $500,000/year and beyond.\n\nThis (admittedly) long post includes the exact Facebook and Google ads, landing pages, copy, sales playbooks, Facebook posts, integrations, videos, websites, pricing strategies and practically everything I\u2019ve used to grow my business.\n\nI\u2019m going to show you what I screwed up (so you can skip my mistakes) and what I got right (so you can copy my success).\n\n**It doesn't matter how fast you go if you\u2019re running in the wrong direction**. I wish someone would have done this for me when I was a newbie. Instead, I had to piecemeal crap for years, lose money, and fight tooth and nail to climb the entrepreneurial mountain.\n\nWell, you can skip that step because this post is your **Ski Lift** to the top of the mountain, so let\u2019s make it **Snowfall** (inside joke, keep reading and you\u2019ll get it).\n\nThese are the most important things I focused on to start growing fast (read: this is what you should focus on too).\n\n\\[Important note: Per the [PII guidelines](https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii), I hid the names, email addresses and phone numbers of customers when necessary.\\]\n\n# Customers\n\nMost folks screw up because they want to change the world with a fancy idea. They ultimately sell something no one wants to buy and go broke. Start with a hungry, burger-loving customer base and sell them burgers, man. [Click to see how I learn about my customers to sell them what they want.](https://imgur.com/a/zJFXhaT)\n\n# Website\n\nMy main goal is to increase website conversions. I want at least 3% of website visitors to schedule a demo with my sales team. My website answers 7 questions. [Click to see the 7 questions my website answers](https://imgur.com/a/bBFxohU).\n\n# Marketing\n\nI pay for eyeballs. I\u2019ve got an outdated blog and my SEO sucks, but who cares? I\u2019m not a publisher so screw all the marketing gurus who demand I write new content everyday. [Click to see my entire marketing funnel, from the Facebook and Google ads I run to the landing pages I use. ](https://imgur.com/a/1Hvie3x)\n\n# Snowfall\n\nThis is my secret weapon. The smartest thing I\u2019ve ever done as a marketer is double down on showcasing customer results. This one strategy will have you feeling like [Franklin Saint from Snowfall](https://imgur.com/a/AA6HCTC) when he realized he was finally going to be rich. I created a handful of videos showing my customer\u2019s results and blasted them all over social media, email and everywhere else my potential customers hangout. [Watch my Snowfall.](https://imgur.com/a/vuippBK)\n\n# Community\n\nIf I can\u2019t first build a community of people who trust me, then I won\u2019t build a business. I want to be the [Pied Piper ](https://imgur.com/a/l554zQ5)for customers who desperately have a problem and money to solve it. My community has been ROI positive from day one and is the gift that keeps on giving. These fans know I have their best interest at heart, so they follow me. [Click to see me build a community that makes me thousands of dollars every month.](https://imgur.com/a/KLvLgHv)\n\n# Sales\n\nSo far I\u2019ve been talking about how to generate demos for my sales team. But demos don\u2019t matter without a way to turn them into money. We created a simple playbook. No fancy scripts. No phony salesmanship. Just a simple process on what happens when we get a new lead. This isn\u2019t as hard as you think. It just takes a little time and a lot of heart. [Click to see our sales playbook. ](https://imgur.com/a/mv7nhK2)\n\n# Raise prices + annual deals\n\nWe started with a single $200/month price point. We left so much money on the table that I still cry every time I think about it. The best thing we\u2019ve done is increase our price and start selling annual deals. Now we have customers who pay us as little as $300/month and as much as $70,000/year. Same product. Different prices. More money. [Click to see the evolution of our pricing strategy.](https://imgur.com/a/OrYgvQi)\n\n# Takeaway\n\nOkay folks, here\u2019s the hard truth: I\u2019m a country boy from the backwoods of Alabama. I was born without marketing knowledge, product knowledge, or sales knowledge. I\u2019ve never studied business or design at fancy schools. I run a technology startup, but I\u2019ve never written a single line of code.\n\nI\u2019ve learned everything from free YouTube videos, $5 books/courses, and expensive mistakes.\n\nIf I can do this, then you can too. (Read that last sentence again). I\u2019m just a guy. I work hard, I'm smart, and I learn from my mistakes. But at the end of the day...I\u2019m just a guy from the backwoods of Alabama.\n\nSuccess leaves clues. There is no reason you can\u2019t copy my work and tailor them for your own business. There is nothing new under the sun, you just have to make it fit your business.\n\n**The companies that made this happen**\n\n* Zapier (Automate all my workflows and send leads to hundreds of places)\n* Active Campaign (Best email marketing software IMHO)\n* Loom (Before I write anything I think \u201ccan I create a video\u201d. If so, I use Loom)\n* Webflow (Build a beautiful website with zero code. Tons of templates.)\n* Group Leads (Add FB Group members to a spreadsheet. #LifeSaver)\n* Twilio (Expensive, but reliable text and calls)\n* Calendly (Set demos with my sales team)\n* Design Pickle (Affordable, awesome design. Priceless)\n* Lightshot (Capture screenshots of results I get for clients)\n* Chargebee (Subscription management that makes Stripe easier to work with)\n* Stripe (Say it with me, \u201cShow me the money\u201d)\n* Trello (Manage all my tasks)\n* Zoom (Demos all day baby)\n* Pipedrive (Good CRM, needs more integrations)\n* LuckyOrange (See what are folks doing on my website in real-time)\n\nCongrats homie! You have reached the end, and now it\u2019s time for the next level.\n\n**This is where my case study ends!**\n\n# -------------------------------------------\n\nBut keep reading if you want to go further into the Matrix and know the intangibles it takes to win. So far we\u2019ve talked strategy and tactics. Sadly, that\u2019s only 20% of the game.\n\nRight now you\u2019re Mario, but you want to be Super Mario flying through the air and throwing fireballs.\n\nNo worries, homie. I got you.\n\n# How to win\n\n## Focus\n\nThe things I focus on almost always get done. The hard part is figuring out what is important enough to focus on. I made this post because I wanted to share what I focus on to achieve success and give you a ski lift. Success leaves clues so just copy me.\n\n## Personal relationships\n\nIt\u2019s hard to do important work by yourself. Your job is to build a solid team and great partnerships. I love working with smart people. Don\u2019t be the guy who sits in your basement working all day only to realize later in life your nerdy neighbor had the missing piece to your puzzle.\n\n## Market &gt; product\n\nThe number one thing I need to have a thriving restaurant is a starving crowd. Most folks spend their entire life savings making the perfect burger (product) only to discover customers (market) aren\u2019t hungry. That\u2019s Hustlin\u2019 Backwards man. You can easily figure out what people are searching (Google), watching (YouTube), buying (Amazon), and sharing (BuzzSumo) in 20 minutes while watching Law &amp; Order SVU reruns.\n\n## Build a community\n\nThe best way to launch your product is to a group of people who know, like and trust you. This is hard work, but it\u2019s worth it, bro. Give people value. Build influence. Grow your fan base. Everything else takes care of itself.\n\n## Track your results\n\nI measure the 3-5 most important things in my business. Then I ask myself, \u201chow can I improve my metrics?\u201d. The answers to that question results in my to-do list. That helps me focus. Focus is my superpower.\n\n## Data &gt; opinions\n\nI don\u2019t care what any **one** **person thinks**. I focus on what sizable groups of potential **customers do**. *Did you catch that?* I focus on what they *do rather than what they think or say*. People will often tell you one thing and do something entirely different. Screw your opinion. I set up experiments, collect data, measure results, and take action.\n\n## Asymmetric risk/rewards\n\nRay Dalio, Jack Bogle, Jeff Bezos, and other folks I study all basically say the same thing: take affordable risks and look for outsized returns. With a 5:1 return, you can screw up four times and still break even with one winner. I like those odds.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nPartnerships are great, but they\u2019re only worth pursuing after you\u2019ve had some success. That\u2019s true because people don\u2019t really want to help you, they want to help themselves. And when you\u2019re not successful it\u2019s hard for them to see how working with you is going to help them. The more successful you are, the easier it is to land a partnership that skyrockets your success.\n\n# My final thoughts\n\n## Don\u2019t take it personally\n\nMost people aren\u2019t going to support you. In fact, they\u2019re probably going to hate and try to tear you down. Don\u2019t take this personally. And don\u2019t waste your energy by getting mad or upset. It\u2019s not their job to believe in you, that\u2019s your job, my friend. Become successful and then make a post like this one to help them out.\n\n## You are the enemy\n\nI\u2019m literally giving the playbook and I\u2019ll be around to answer questions in the comments. But most people haven\u2019t read this far, and they won\u2019t ask questions, and they won\u2019t take action. Instead, they\u2019re learning how to design their own logo using Sketch.\n\n## Take massive action\n\nGetting an LLC, designing a pretty logo, hunting for the perfect domain name, doing years of market research, overthinking your next move, listening to haters/trolls, etc are all reasons people never take action and ultimately fail.\n\n## Be humble. Be confident.\n\nDon\u2019t be overconfident and think you have all the answers. In the same breath, believe in yourself and don\u2019t over-optimize for someone else's opinion all the time. Collect your own data with small experiments/tests and take it from there.\n\n## Be positive\n\nI don\u2019t want to get all Tony Robbins on you man, but YOU REALLY CAN DO THIS. It\u2019s hard work. Sometimes it sucks (like, really sucks). The more successful you become, the more haters you get. Hobbies are lost, friendships fade.\n\nBut the good outweighs the bad by 1,000,000 to 1. So trust me, you got it. And if you need help then I got you.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever in doubt then refer back to this post because this is your **Ski Lift**, so go make it **SnowFall.**\n\nI hoped this post gave you the confidence and energy needed to get to work.\n\n# How to reach me\n\nIf you have an interesting problem you\u2019re working on and think I\u2019d be a cool partner or just want some encouragement then let me know in the comments.\n\nFollow me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RealHassanRiggs).\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nGiven the DM request, I edited to add my Facebook Group: If you want to [join my community where I plan to talk about all this stuff in more detail then let's do it homie](https://www.facebook.com/groups/snowfallstartup/). I'm still in the process of setting this up (at this very moment) and plan to have more Q&amp;A there.",

            "comment": "&gt; I used to work for a real estate brokerage to set appointments for real estate agents, so I know this problem very well. \n\nThis is the key takeaway for anybody interested in serious money, especially in the ripe B2B world: *domain knowledge*. It doesn't have to take much, even just a summer job, but it puts you leaps and bounds ahead of the typical wantrapreneur just out of school who has zero domain knowledge in anything (except being a consumer, or internet user like everyone else) and tries to find some idea in those broad categories along with a million others like them. \n\nThe B2B world gets ignored by startups in the meantime, yet a lot of industries have a big need for innovative new products or services, and lots of money to spend on it. B2B worked for me -- I first got work experience in a particular aviation niche, saw the terrible software they had to use because there was almost nobody making it, made a much improved version, and made millions (net). \n\nI suggest if you're just out of school and itching to start some kind of business but don't know what, pick an industry you are interested in, build up some work experience in that industry, learn the lingo, learn the workflow, see what products and services they use as part of their business, and see if you can create competition (and if not, try a different industry). By narrowing to a specific domain, you will have eliminated 99.99% of the other entrepreneurs looking for ideas, because they may have no idea your niche even exists, and even if they wanted to compete later, they wouldn't know the domain well enough to be competitive.\n\nIt's true capturing a broad consumer market is how you make billions, but success is arguably much more difficult than capturing a much smaller, specialized niche. Would you rather have a 0.01% chance of making a billion, or 50% chance of making a million for the same investment?",

Made an application for a real estate office I worked at to manage their print advertising for listings. It would help them rotate through all their listings so each listing would get some time in various print ads and emailed the customers that they were getting advertised. It would print a report for the advertiser with what to print and record when the listing was last advertised there. It's not something you would think to build unless you worked in the field.",

Do you have burgers? \n\nScrew their opinion. Collect your own data. Build a business. \n\nMost people have great ideas and then listen to some jerk on social media who says \u201cthat\u2019s a bad idea\u201d. Then they don\u2019t build the business because someone who was never going to be a customer anyway says they don\u2019t like it. \n\nThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t listen to other people homie. Just don\u2019t do it. People don\u2019t want you to win. They want themselves to win. And if they can\u2019t win then they will try to poke holes in your winning formula. \n\nI see I happen all the time. Don\u2019t let them do it to you man.

I try to average under $2 a lead (usually under $1), but I have seen those more experienced with FB ads generate leads for as low as $.14 a lead. Cold calling takes a lot of time but requires little capital.\n\nIn my area, there are companies that charge $500-700 a month for 10 \"hot\" leads a month. I can't speak to how hot these leads are, but I would assume much warmer than FB ad leads. Sifting through FB or other lead capture leads as well as contacting them takes more time than a lot of agents are willing to commit to, or it's not worth their time if they are high producers. Hence why a lot of agents are willing to pay so much per month to have hotter leads brought straight to them.\n\nI was once told (and I don't have anything data at this moment to back this up) that contacting leads immediately after they are captured leads to higher conversion rates. If I'm running a successful ad campaign and generating a lot of leads, calling each of them right after their information is captured would be very cumbersome for myself and probably a lot of other agents, which is why this idea works since it automates that process. \n\nHaving these types of systems and automation in place is IMO a great way to use leverage to grow one's business since it cuts out a lot of the time consuming work. I could see myself using this service in the future, but for now since I just started this year I would need to get to a point where I generate enough leads that it makes sense.\n\nHope all that makes sense",

So I feel like a lot of them if your not shopping for 600k+ they are not really looking to bend over backwards to assist with anything. Also a ton of shoppers get disinterested in general, or cant secure financing and that is just lost times you spend 25 days showing someone and doing the contracts and communicating with all parties and then they back out cause they cant secure financing that is a opportunity cost. If you dont have a preapproval letter most wont even call you back till they see that. Its def hard currently looking to buy a 2nd house for rental income at the 200k mark and gone through 3 realtors already lol",

You don\u2019t need a product to do that either. \n\nOne thing you can do is broaden your interest. Smart people (the folks you want to work with) have diverse taste. You can meet your future co founder in unexpected places. \n\nI\u2019d avoid the match making co founder sites because you want to know someone a bit before you automatically start a company with them. \n\n1. Do your values align? (If you\u2019re always bumping heads on core issues then that\u2019s bad. You only know that after you actually know someone though)\n2. Can they do the work?

At what point did you decide to go for the gig full time?\n\nI\u2019m asking because I have ideas buzzing around for a startup and it\u2019s something I want to do at some point, but my day job gives me stability and that\u2019s something my wife and family need. I\u2019m hoping I can start something on the side so I can eventually make the transition.\n\nAlso, upvote for snowfall! Binged the entire show in two weeks. One of my new favorite shows on TV",

Still learning all of this. \n\nI know I have a great idea and I have experience in the industry. Your idea about making something before getting involves is spot on. My only problem is that I am having a hard time making something. \n\nFor this week I am working on Problem Statement and define keywords for landing page so I get some idea. I truly believe the data-driven approach is best as you said it, instead of opinions. \n\nBe great if we can chat just so I can pick your brain a bit. :)",

Is it through comparing rates?\n\nI want to know everything about how you decided to charge your customers for your service. I need a pricing model for myself and could use some testimonies across different fields and industries and types of services from all types of folks.",

I've played with different models of how to charge over the years, but with so little overhead now, I kept it simple. \n\nI decided how much money I want to make in a year, how many billable hours per week I wish to work for it, and set an hourly rate that meets that criteria after taxes. \n\nDone. \n\nNot the sexiest answer, but it works for me.",

I was planning on doing the same.\n\nThe only hesitancy I have is\u2026 \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nHonestly, a lack of confidence that I wasn\u2019t worth the amount has stopped me from exploring to just doing this simple thing. How did you deal with the imposter syndrome for charging this amount if there was any or if any would come up?",

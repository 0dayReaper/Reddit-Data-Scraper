    "postText": "I\u2019m very proficient in aquariums I have been my whole life. I feel like there may be a market in my area for setting up and maintaining aquariums so people would not have to maintain them. I would almost do it similar to Mark Cuban\u2019s \u2018cost plus drugs\u2019 where there\u2019s just a 15% markup for the products, and a 3-5$ service charge for every visit, that way it stays very consistent and if there is a sale on products my customers would get a sale too, as I did not have to pay as much this time around, they would not either.\nThis leads me to a couple of questions one how would I start advertising? Of course, Facebook, word of mouth but is there the other unique ways you can think of ? \n\nHow I would charge:\nFor example, if you wanted me to set up a 20 gallon aquarium with 10 neon tetras, five corydoras gravel substrate, but you already have the tank, light, and filter, I would charge: 1.15(.85(10x2.99) + 5x3.99 + 20). \n\nThis is where I feel there might be an appeal. at petsmart, For example you get a 15% discount if you buy four or more neon tetras and therefore I would give my customers a 15% discount as I do not have to spend as much either.\n\nThen I would charge $2 and $2 for the dechlorinator and bio start ( just cost of using some of the $20 bottle) As well as the flat $5 fee like I described for every visit. So I\u2019m total the bill of setting up the 20 gallon would look like this: \n5 + 1.15(.85(10x2.99) + 5x3.99 +20 + 2 + 2)= $84.74. \n\nAlso, would I need any sort of business license?\n\nI am 21 if that changes anything\u2026\n\nAnd then also if you had an aquarium would this interest you, I\u2019m not advertising here I\u2019m just collecting thoughts to see what that perspective would be personally, I would not, but that is because I like maintaining my aquariums. I\u2019m sure there are people who would prefer to just have it be a nice centerpiece, and not worry about maintenance. \n\nWhat are your initial thoughts, questions, concerns do you have, as I feel I might really do this, so I want as much feedback as possible. Thank you!!!!",

Credibly explain your background, provide some sort of compensation to the store in return for including, for example, an advertising insert.\n\nThey probably won't let you take a crack at their customer database. However something where you provide a value add they can offer and it is under the customer's control may be more appealing.",

Gas prices are sky high at the moment. \n\nThink about insurance and contracts - if an aquarium you supply and maintain breaks and causes property damage, you do not want to be liable! \n\nMaybe offer a \u2018training package\u2019 - There\u2019s a bee keeping club near me that will show you their hives and teach you how to set up a hive of your own. It takes a weekend 2x five hour sessions. They do groups of 5 and charge \u00a3100 per head, with no travel or liability costs. Something to consider. \n\nOtherwise, seems like a cool business OP. Future proof and liable to develop repeat custom. Best of luck with it!",

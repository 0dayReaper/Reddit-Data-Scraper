I've spent hundreds of hours not just teaching myself how to develop something but then creating a brand identity, establishing a business, etc.As part of this process, I've built my website, hated it, started over, liked it a little more but still hated it, started over - multiple times (you get the idea) and right now I'm finally feeling like I'm close to where it should be - but I also know how vested I am in it and because it's only me - I need other perspective.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind - check out my website [https://www.heyitsbloom.com/](https://www.heyitsbloom.com/) and let me know what you think. I welcome any good advice, perspective, criticism, etc.\n\nThanks!  \n\n\n\\*\\*Update\\*\\* I just wanted to take a minute and thank everyone who gave tips. I've already began incorporating changes, and I'll continue working on others. This was exactly what I needed and I really appreciate the feedback and criticism. I feel like I moved the dial a little bit today, that's the goal!",

I really need to dial in the headline and copy to better speak to my target audience and emphasize our UVP in a more effective way.  \n\n\nWhat primarily makes BLOOM special is that it removes the technical bar of entry from anyone who wants to use the latest AI to create marketing content without knowing anything about AI or marketing. Essentially reducing the process to a relatively quick chat and then delivering their content. Than we have added features that ideally not only create value but introduce sticky points (AI coaches, Social media Manager/Planner, Website Builder).  \n\n\nThe copy and really the whole marketing for this is a code I've got to crack. I'm finding as I get in the weeds in everything - the technical development, the business strategy, it makes it hard for me to just simply write good copy for what BLOOM is. As soon as I'm able, I'll bring on a creative to take ownership of this.  \n\n\nThank you for your feedback, I really appreciate it!",

Is it small trade businesses like plumbers? Is it online business coaches? Is it hospitality businesses?\n\nAnd who is going to be actually using the tool? Is it the owner of the business? Or a dedicated marketer? Or an admin assistant?\n\nKey to successful business is solving a specific problem that someone will pay to have solved for them..

Everyone who has a product needs to market it and I haven\u2019t seen a ton of affordable AI-powered marketing services or products, so this sounds like a solid business to be in. I agree with the previous comment about the logo reading more like Blom rather than Bloom. I\u2019d also consider removing the first line of text (\u201cyou know you need digital marketing\u2026\u201d) and more concisely putting a stronger focus on your potential customer\u2019s problem (ie \u201cno time?\u201d \u201cno budget?\u201d). It\u2019s also probably worth rethinking No Cost and instead include something like,  (Get Started At No Cost), so it doesn\u2019t seem too good to be true thereby drawing skepticism. \n\nMaybe you should also consider checking out other solopreneurs who are also building AI products and/or sharing their entrepreneurial journey via the Indie Hackers podcast, Mat Leave MVP newsletter (https://matleavemvp.beehiiv.com), and The Saas Podcast. Hearing about others\u2019 ups and downs is usually pretty insightful. Good luck!",

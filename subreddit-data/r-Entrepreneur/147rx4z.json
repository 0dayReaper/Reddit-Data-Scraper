    "postText": "As the title says, I have an idea for a SaaS/subscription solution but I\u2019m not a developer (I have some python skills but not in developing full solutions).\n\nThe options that I currently have are:\n1. Learn how to build this (it\u2019s a visual tool with a database) probably gonna take ages and won\u2019t be able to design a good one in a short time.\n2. Pay a developer (probably costly and above budget)- any ideas for a cheap option? Freelancers overseas perhaps?\n3.find a technical cofounder. - where do I find one? \ud83e\udd72\n\n\nThanks",

For a technical co-founder, you\u2019d need to be willing to give up equity or have some kind of revenue/profit sharing to entice them into joining for reduced or no pay. \n\nI have over 10 years of development experience and run my own software development firm. Feel free to send me a DM if you have any questions. I\u2019d be more than happy to point you in a few directions and answer any questions you may have.",

            "comment": "My first thoughts are: what\u2019s the market like? Like, how much alcohol is there that\u2019s exclusive to Scotland/UK? And how are you going to find international customers? Then logistics and laws: how are you going to physically move it and deal with customs? I\u2019m in the US, and we have some weird laws with alcohol. For instance, alcohol can\u2019t be imported here by mail. What are you going to be able to bring to compete against giant multinational corporations like Diageo, especially since your overhead is going to be a larger percentage per bottle than theirs. What kind of profit margins will you be able to manage?\n\nSo, basically, I guess my thoughts come down to: how much money is there to be made with this, how much work will it take to make that money, and what edge are you going to bring? It sounds like a massive pain in the ass to me, but that might be a beneficial barrier to entry if it doesn\u2019t sound like a massive pain in the ass to you.",

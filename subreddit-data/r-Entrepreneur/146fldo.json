While it's clearly not the next Hugo Boss it does have a slightly odd  attractiveness to it! \n\nI will read that discussion, thanks for that should be useful for my research before I make any moves! \n\nI suppose miracles would do the trick with anything, but especially for startups like this where there's so many people doing it! Thanks for your input \ud83d\udc4d",

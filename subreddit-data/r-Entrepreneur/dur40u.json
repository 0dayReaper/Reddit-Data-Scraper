Where the angles at?\u201d\n\n6)  \u201cHi, I\u2019m Pat from starterstory with another interview with someone who will share their revenue numbers (meaningless), but not profit numbers. Enjoy this self promotion, which is normally banned, but allowed because the post is greater than 100,000 characters.\u201d\n\n5)  \u201cYou should get into power washing\u201d\n\n4) Any genuine request for help by someone who\u2019s actually put in time to establish a product or service is flagged as self-promotion and shut down, thereby removing users who are actively trying to seek help to build their business.\n\n3)  The number of people who believe that drop shipping (outside of drop shipping courses) is still viable for the average person\n\n2)  \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea. Somebody pay me.\u201d\n\n1. \u201cI hate my job and want to be a bazzilionaire, but I\u2019ve tried nothing and I\u2019m all out of ideas.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to add you own below :)\n\nEdit: If this post gets at least 50 upvotes, I'll create a sub where people are welcome to talk about their products and the bullshit is cut down as much as possible. So tired of this shit. We need a place where we can talk strategy without interruption.\n\nEdit 2: This post literally got 5 upvotes in 2 seconds. I've been checking. At least we agree on one thing around here :)\n\nEdit 3: It's official! We're doing this. New community is /r/cutthebull Thanks guys. Today is my last day in this sub. Taking moderator applications from people who have a strong internal bullshit detector.\n\nEdit 4: Going to bed guys. Thanks so much for your support. I'll have a look at your comments when I get up tomorrow.\n\nEdit 5: The mods of this sub are a **class act.** Some have reached out to me to explain how I can best run the new sub. I no longer believe that they are the problem here. I was ignorant.",

            "comment": "There have been a number of subs started by people who have left /r/Entrepreneur and I hope you will be successful. If there is anything I can do to help you do that let me know. You might not want to have any affiliation with /r/Entrepreneur after you leave and that's fine but if you do want people joining from the sub we can list you on the sidebar after you get about 1k subscribers.\n\n\nThe things that you are annoyed by would be solved by an aggressive editor and either detailed rules about what content is allowable or freedom for the editor to delete stuff they don't like or that violates unwritten rules. Our mods don't have the power your editors will have over content because the sub was founded to accept posts and rely on Reddit voting to downvote the less valuable. \n\nWhile any subscriber can propose a new rule for moderation they have either been unsupported or more commonly a sort of vague \"delete stuff I don't like and I know that when I see it.\" This often seems to be desired for material that has hundreds of upvotes or comments. I have and do delete posts with hundreds or even thousands of votes if they break the rules but should things within the rules be deleted if hundreds of people find them useful and a single mod does not? The answer is yes in some subs and that's ok because that's their rules.",

I read and think I understood your issues but solving them without becoming editors of content look impossible. A rule change of \"become editors of content and ban x (power washing, newbie comments, anything I deem low value)\" could be suggested but it is every bit the fundamental change you describe and requires very widespread support. I would expect to immediately delete material that tens of thousands of people would otherwise find interesting and upvote were it to be implemented - ironically including your own post about how to improve the sub.",

Personally, I think this sub would be a whole lot more \"on-point\" if only users who actually have started a business were allowed in.

There's plenty of great companies which are running in the red for a variety of valid reasons (mainly due to aggressively scaling). If you're running a powerwashing business (META) then obviously being unprofitable is a terrible thing, but if you're running a rapidly scaling tech business then running in the red and growing on the back of VC money can be a sign that you're doing great. Tesla spent most of its existence running in the red and I don't think any of us would turn down an opportunity to travel back in time and buy equity in that company while it was still small. Profitability is the endgame for any successful company, but it isn't always a smart short and middle-term plan. If your market is growing and you're putting your dollars into your pocket as profits instead of into hiring and growing then you're missing a larger opportunity.",

                                    "comment": "&gt; FYI, Uber lost $5.2 billion last quarter. I feel like this shit will go down in history as the dotcom bubble v2\n\n  I think the big thing that VCs have lost sight of and has led to bad companies like Uber getting propped up by VC money is the ultimate question: \"Is this product priced for profitability once we stop scaling\". Running in the red isn't a bad thing when you're growing/scaling to realize your full market, but if there isn't an endgame where you're profitable once you stop scaling then you're a bad investment and a bad company. Uber has no profitable endgame other than some hand-waving \"something something self driving cars\" which relies on tech that likely won't be realized before Uber's bubble inevitably pops. They're selling a service for less money than it costs them to provide it. That's a bad business model. Bad companies like Uber shouldn't be used as an example of \"you're only good if you're profitable\" though. Plenty of great companies have spent a good chunk of their early life deep in the red. An ELI5 example:  \n\n  You manufacture and distribute widgets. You're currently profitable selling 10k widgets/quarter and you're at your max manufacturing and distribution capacity. A large order opportunity comes along that will double your sales (20k/quarter) but will require you to expand your capacity. This is a good thing. You sell some equity and expand capacity with the investment money. The next quarter the same thing happens, and then for two more quarters. Now you're at 100k widgets/quarter in sales, but your balance sheet is deep in the red for the year in terms of profitability and you only own 80% of your company now. Are you better or worse off now?  \n\n  Of course you're better off. You're selling 10x as much product, you're priced for profitability once you stop scaling and if anything your margins are probably better now than they were (thanks to economies of scale), and that 80% equity that you own is massively more valuable than the 100% equity you owned before. You had an unprofitable year, but one of growth that put you on a path to greater long term success.  \n\n  -Edit- For clarity, \"profit\" isn't a great measure of success by itself because plenty of good companies aren't currently profitable. If you're not looking a gross margins, growth, market share, and market cap then you're missing a lot of information that you need in order to start assessing the health and success of a company.",

I realize nothing is perfect and some interviews aren't valuable to you, but that's just my two cents.\n\nDo you know how much traffic Starter Story gets from Reddit? A couple hundred visits per month - that's nothing compared to the 100k people that visit the site every month from other channels. Just annoyed when people call me a shill and think I have some master spam plan or advertising scheme.\n\nGood luck on your sub bro. Moderating a community is hard, but I sincerely wish you luck.",

A lot of the paid courses are not worth it\n\nSome free sources that I\u2019ve found really helpful is\n-VerumEcon (YouTube + Facebook group)\n-Gabriel St-Germain (YouTube + Facebook group)\n\nThen just looking around the internet for anything dropshipping related. That one small tip you find somewhere in the corners of the internet could be the difference from you being profitable or not.\n\nAlso I agree that dropshipping is by no means a get rich scheme. You need to develop so many skills that take time such as\n-Website building\n-Identifying trends\n-Product research\n-Marketing skills\n-AD strategies\n-Creative work construction (video editing?)\n-Ad copy\n-And some additional skills such as coding and photo editing can help you as well but aren\u2019t necessary\n\nDropshipping is simply a fulfillment process. If you don\u2019t have the skills to make your store look branded when it\u2019s not, then it will be hard. You also need to be clear with your customers that shipping may take 2-3 weeks.\n\nI also think dropshipping is more useful as a way to test out and introduce someone to entrepreneurship. Once you find that winning product, you then can white label it.",

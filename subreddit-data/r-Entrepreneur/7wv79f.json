It would be ideal if we could all discuss ideas, technologies, approaches, and there is some of that, but given that its literally a sub about Entrepreneurs, well, the Entrepreneurs come swooping in with their sales pitch in disguise.\n\nThe problem is, like you say, things like fake shopify numbers -- there are dozens, if not, hundreds of guys on youtube claiming to make 30k in one day, or 500k in 6 months, blah blah, still living in their parents basement, still promoting 'hey guys just pay $5 to a cat influencer on instagram....' it's fucking bullshit. It's absolute bullshit. Who can do that, who has the heart to doctor up fake sales and convince a bunch of kids they too can do it...\n\nIt's all a huge joke and a scam and 99% of the 'content' I see on here is the same sort of shit. Fake fake fake.\n\nAs for people who say 'Well if you don't like it, just leave', that is such a copout. We should all aspire for more, we should push buttons and ask questions. We should want a community that can be a great discussion point, right now this is like a bodybuilding convention where everybody knows the dudes are juicing but nobody wants to talk about it. They just wanna keep talking about what band of protein they use. \n\nSure. Nah. It's not cool. ",

The problem in the past has been if I propose changes they are largely ignored and other changes are ill defined or suffer the same lack of engagement. \n\nProblems are easy to identify. Problems that everyone agrees on are hard to identify. Solutions are even harder.\n\nSo let's hear it. \"Ban advertising\" Ok, what exactly defines advertising? Saying \"you know it when you see it\" gives me as a mod - and any other mod - an enormous amount of unchecked power so you need a definition. Next: Do you think that the majority of the sub agrees with that definition and attitude? All you need is enough people to engage with comments or voting to show support but most proposals seem to fail here. Beat that inertia and you can change things, that is all it takes.",

And they *weren't* given handouts by strangers online. \n\n**People are fucken lazy.**\n\nThey come to a forum and expect giants to give them solutions on a silver platter. \n\n&gt;\"What business should I start that makes me a lot of money?\"\n\n&gt;\"I saved up $10,000 at 22...how can I become a millionaire like......yesterday?\"\n\nThis is the exact opposite type of behavior that entrepreneurs will endorse.\n\nI'll tell you one thing though. The true players....the guys who have made it.\n\nThey're here.\n\nThey read this sub from time to time. But they'll hardly ever comment.\n\nThey're shaking their heads in disgust.\n\nYou'll catch a few of them on their way up. It'll be the super detailed and sincere AMA about the guy who finally cracked six figures after 8 years of hard work. He'll feel on top of the world because he can finally send his parents on vacation, cover his families medical bills, move his long term girlfriend and daughter of 4 into a safer neighborhood.\n\nHe'll answer your questions for 24 hours and you'll never hear from him again. It's often a throwaway account too. So don't bother messaging them for short cuts.\n\nThey've earned their free time.\n\nLess whining and more work.\n\nThis forum has a wealth of knowledge in the form of golden nuggets...all you gotta do is sift through the bullshit and you'll be rewarded...\n\nBut you don't wanna do that eh?\n\nIt'll take too long, right?\n\nI know that when I make it *(and I've already started seeing ripples of success)*, the last thing I'm gonna want to do is **waste time on a forum explaining shit to lazy people about how I got HERE**.\n\nTo the countless people who will downvote this comment to the bottom of the abyss...good luck in the future.",

He also claims to be in Malaysia but is out posting elsewhere on how to handle basic admin at the border there... and they are everywhere, these lying weasels without a clue claiming to be millionaires because \"fake it until you make it\" from your momma's bedroom. \n\nThe real issue is that people coining in decent money aren't posting, \"Here's how I went from $0 to $1 million in a year, ask me how?\" type shit. Most of them are not posting at all, they're making millions and out with cool people and hot chicks rather than on /r/iwishiwereasuccess\n\nWhilst it's not true \"those who can, do, those who can't, teach\" it has become an absolute truism of the Internet. \n\nNo, you are not a trainer because you have a Udemy course about the 2 weeks you spent programming or web-designing before you realized you were shit and thought there'd be easy money in teaching. Only to discover that nobody fell for it so you needed to spam Reddit, just as you did when your Shopify store made no money (and look how well that didn't turn out) and so on...\n\nI've given up on all business related subs now. There is nothing there. I am not a millionaire (...actually, technically, I am on paper but trust me, I can't spend it) but I make decent money by freelancing in a tough field. I hoped that the quality of conversation on Reddit would be better than on LinkedIn (where much of the same delusional cancer is given airspace) but it's not. So, I'm out, at least until I saw this post today. Now, I'm out again. ",

No regulations, bunch of assholes looking to exploit everybody else, that majority of it being shit, etc etc. Like this is in fact the perfect place to learn about entrepeneurship.",

I\u2019ll pay you nothing and you\u2019ll get 0.5% of my company in shares, if you create it from nothing with 0 input from me and I\u2019ll get the other 99.5%.\u2019 \n\nThose are my favourite kind of posts. \n\nOr, \n\n\u2018Hey guys, I have 0 experience money or ideas, I\u2019m lazy and want to make money by doing absolutely nothing - give me ideas so I can start a successful business\u2019 \n\nOr the famous \u2018what went wrong?\u2019 \n\n\u2018I only worked 1 hour a month and my product has absolutely no purpose or demand. \u2018\n\nI could go on - if you want the community to be a resource for entrepreneurs then you\u2019re going to have to suffer fools, also many people answering the questions probably have no experience or place answering them. \n\nBecause of the way Reddit works you\u2019re going to struggle to police that, unless perhaps we ban certain types of threads, or require that they be of a certain specificity. \n\nEither way it gives me a good laugh sometimes - if you\u2019re going to make a business. Be realistic. Make an actual business plan, plan for the worst. And expect to work harder then you ever would for anyone else. But be happy with that because you\u2019re doing it for yourself and not some under-appreciative, under-qualified boss.\n",

I think what is going on in this subreddit is a very big exaggeration of reality.  \"i was piss drunk down on my luck, and i had an idea, so i took that 100 dollars and now im making 50,000 every 5 months!\n\nyah ok dude. im not saying everyone is like this here.  But i have noticed this as well, op.  It's very bad and I really dislike it.  this place has changed.  all it is is a bullshit place for people to be cocky and act like you are jesus or something.\n\n\"omg bro i sold 5 websites!!! im a fucking GENIUS!! now i will go online and dictate to others how successful i am im the best ever!!\"\n\nTHATS what it has become",

Shopify shops are a thing, they can make money, they're low-gate entry and basically interesting for people who may not be quite as advanced as some of the people here. I, for one, have learned a lot reading about this.\n\nThe whole idea of 'dropshipping' or 'shopify' shops being overdone and less useful is really a side effect of the low-gate entry to their use and generally the competition.\n\nSome people may not really have 25k to drop into some shop. It's a good way to get involved with relatively low risk and initial costs.\n\n&gt;30% of the posts consists of people trying to make money off us, one way or another, be it trough affiliate marketing or some elaborate scamming scheme or whatever.\n\nOh, someone's trying to make money from you? Woe unto them. Please go blast your outrage on twitter and facebook from a phone built in china by apple.\n\nIt's how capitalism works, dude.\n\n&gt;  20% of the posts are people who have legit problems and need advice.\n\nCool, that's good... and it's rather a good percentage.\n\n&gt;  20% of the posts are about people who actually have to say something. \n\nAgain, another good percentage. When added together that's a pretty good return.\n\n&gt; Even with the content, every other post is someone trying to convince us they make 653 Quadtrillion a day. There is no requirement for evidence, everyone can just join and spread their cancer.\n\nOh well, use of bad language to make things seem bad with purposeful hyperbole to exaggerate the point. Some people make money, some people make less, some people lie and some people dont. Appreciate the medium, the method and the wisdom, and maybe just filter the things that seem less useful.\n\n&gt; It was fun while it lasted, but this is now as cancerous as YouTube. Too many marketing articles, too many 17 year old entrepreneurs.\n\n\"bleh bleh bleh, cancer Aids, hate speech, bleh bleh bleh\". In reality, youtube is a fucking amazing thing. And such platforms are probably a technological realisation that can be compared to the printing press.\n\n&gt; I am here to learn, but I simply don't see that happen, every other problem is shit, things you get in the first grade of business school. \n\nWhat if you never went to business school?\n\n\nI'd be interested to see your take on how to actually make things better though.\n\n",

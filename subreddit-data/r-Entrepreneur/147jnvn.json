    "postText": "I had an initial business idea and while I'm currently out of the country for a couple of months, I agreed to let my friend take care of our start-up in my absence. We haven't drafted a contract yet, but now I want to end our partnership because my friend has failed to prove his worthiness. He talks a big game and claims to be driven, but he hasn't lived up to my expectations. He couldn't contribute capital to our joint bank account, and it's become apparent that he lacks knowledge in business, requiring me to teach him what I know. Moreover, he constantly makes excuses about being busy with his 9-5 job and personal life, which has caused significant delays in our progress. And since we're friends, he expects me to understand his circumstances, knowing he's less fortunate and has financial responsibilities, including debts and impending fatherhood.\rAdditonally, I also can't shake the feeling that he's probably taking advantage of me due to my knowledge and resources. He once quoted this from rich dad, poor dad \"you just have to know a little of a lot and you can hire people smarter than you,\" which makes me believe I'm that smarter guy and he's also using me as a stepping stone. \n\r  \nOne particular red flag occurred when I assigned him the task of purchasing materials for our R&amp;D. He claimed to be too busy and entrusted the task to our mutual friend. Although our friend managed to purchase the materials and provided the receipts, the change was being kept, and obtaining a copy of the receipt took considerable effort. As for the change, he promised to return it on his payday, which was yesterday, yet I still haven't received any updates regarding it.\r  \n\r  \nI no longer wish to tolerate these B.S. I understand my own mistake in this situation, and I do feel incredibly stupid. I have forgiven these 2 friends already, but I no longer want to continue this partnership. How do I terminate this partnership while still maintaining our friendship if it still is possible? I would greatly appreciate any advice. To break the news will most likely be a surprise and he won't take it well.",

If you want them to save face just tell them that's okay they are not actually needed on this phase because you will do the R&amp;D and you will call them later when you need their skills.",

Basically, I handle strategic planning and accounting, and I have secured a potential investor. On the other hand, his task is business development. However, he'd overlap in our planning roles, and it unfortunately hasn't proven to be useful. He talks a big game about our success, but he hasn't been able to pick up the slack or demonstrate the level of competence he claims to possess, based on my observation.",

You are describing such a dumpster fire that I\u2019m starting to doubt your abilities. \n\nI'm 22, and have recently graduated college. I admit, I made a significant error in judgement when considering him as a business partner. This guy and I are buddies. His inspiring stories of overcoming poverty and getting to where he's at now made me believe he would be a suitable partner. I got sold on his determination and how he conquered obstacles from scratch. Additionally, I thought he's as passionate as I am in this project. However in hindsight, I learned that an effective business partner should complement one's strengths and possess qualities that one lacks, rather than being too similar. \n\n&gt;Why did you have an absence this early on? \n\nHad no choice. My parents had already booked me a flight back to my home country before the business idea came up. I was too eager to start immediately and make it work long distance which was a bad idea I know.",

No, most of the time friends aren\u2019t the best option. Nope, a leave of absence early on is not a good idea. And you shouldn\u2019t blame other people for your failures, own it. If i trust a crackhead to park my car, should i blame him for stealing it or myself for trusting him?\n\nYou are still really young and hopefully have a lot of time to start multiple businesses when you get older. Your university time is over but now you need to start educating yourself.

Emphasize that your decision isn't personal but is based on what you think is best for the business. Make it clear that you value the friendship separate from the business partnership.\r\n\nDocument Everything: Until the end of the partnership is formalized, make sure you document all decisions and transactions. This is important to protect yourself and the business.\r\n\nProfessional Help: Consider getting advice from a business attorney to understand any potential legal obligations you might have. This is particularly important if there isn't a formal contract but there's an implied partnership.\r\n\nOffer a Graceful Exit: Propose a plan that allows your friend to exit gracefully. Perhaps they can take a lesser role or be involved in a capacity that doesn't require as much time or commitment.\r\n\nSeparate Business and Personal Matters: Keep your conversations focused on the business, not personal issues. This will help ensure that the process remains professional and doesn't become a personal attack.\r\n\nBe Prepared for Consequences: Unfortunately, even if you handle the situation as diplomatically as possible, there is a risk that your friend may react poorly. Prepare yourself for this possibility and stand firm in your decision.\r\n\nSeek Support: Reach out to your support network during this process. It can be an emotional time, and having others who understand your situation can help immensely.\r\n\n It's never easy to mix business with friendships, but honest, open communication can help navigate through this. Best of luck!",

One I started getting a few sales I then looked for people I could hire or partner with to scale the business. Not friends btw. But actual people I saw potential in.",

Tell him that you don't want this to strain his life, and that you can manage this independently. That you wish him well, but the project will continue to be more demanding, and there is no way this would become more feasible for him.\n\nOption 2: He says no. Then ask him, if it's not a strain then why is the ball dropping? Is this what his 100% looks like? Because the business is only going to get more demanding, and time, money &amp; knowledge investment from your end is unsustainable at this rate. You wouldn't want this to strain the friendship, so it's better you part when the bond is solid.\n\nDon't blame, don't ask why, and don't entertain excuses. Simply communicate your needs openly. \n\nIf he's your friend, he will understand and respect your decisions. \n\nIf not, then it's better to end things before bad experiences sully all good memories.\n\nHope this helps :)",

You're right, this is an enormous red flag, I would do what the top commenter recommends and simply say you are not interested in pursuing this with anyone else at this time, but if he asks why, or complains about it, definitely bring the above issue up.  Say, you cannot operate with that level of unprofessionalism, you didn't ask him to shirk his job onto somebody else, you asked him to do the work, and, at the very least, if he intends on outsourcing this commitment, he needs to ensure, AT A BARE MINIMUM, that no theft is occurring?  He seems very out to lunch in terms of the value he's bringing, which doesn't sound like much -- and honestly, if you lose literally nothing by dumping him and he loses everything by losing the opportunity and is upset, that just goes to show how one-sided the whole relationship is.",

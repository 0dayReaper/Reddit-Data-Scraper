    "postText": "Maybe I'm way over thinking this, but I'm lost. I reached out to a couple of accountants last week but can't get in to see anyone for a couple weeks, and now I'm worrying that we're just racking up penalties.\n\nThe wife and I started a business this year. She was laid off in December and we took this as an opportunity to try and build something for ourselves. We didn't pay towards estimated tax in Q1. We've made a small amount of money, but it's hard to gauge where we're going to end up at the end of the year because we'll likely have expenses Q3 and Q4. I'm trying to figure out how to true us up for the June 15 deadline.\n\nI still have a full time job, and we're a multimember LLC which seems to be breaking all of the online \"help me estimate my tax\" tools.\n\nA) We're a new business so we have NO clue what we're going to make this year so have no idea how to estimate how we're going to net out at the end of the year,\n\nB) Wife was laid off from a high-earning role in December, so our household income is going to be dramatically less this year than it was last year. I'd expect our AGI without factoring in the business to be 40-45% of what it was last year,\n\nC) I've read that if we just pay up to what we paid in tax last year we can avoid the underpayment penalty, but because of B that's sort of not an option,\n\nD) When paying quarterly taxes online through the IRS portal, I don't see any way to allocate your payment to a specific quarter. Is the measure just whether you paid \"something\" in each quarter\n\nThey'd have no way of knowing whether we operated at a loss in Q1 and thus didn't owe any tax.\n\nAm I just really over thinking this?\n\nMaybe I should just pay 30% of profit-to-date and stop worrying about it. Does anyone who's been through this the first time have any tips?",

I move 40% of PROFITS into a tax-only account and use it for tax payments only; everything else is cash money",

            "comment": "You are over thinking it. It is complicated, but, not quite as complicated as it is feeling.  \n\n\nIt's an estimate. It does not need to be exact. The penalties are not that bad if you do happen to underpay.  \n\n\nAny payment you make now is a quarter 2 payment.   \n\n\nIf you want to use a method that takes in to account that you operated at a loss, you can use the annualized method of calculating any penalties, but it's probably not worth the work, actually. It's not as simple as \"no income, in quarter 1, so we didn't need to pay anything\" as you had w2 income during that time, and estimated payments are for your total tax liability, as one big pool of tax liability.   \n\n\nPaying 25% of profit to date to federal is a pretty good estimate, and you can true up on later quarters as you know more. Does your state also need an estimated payment?",

I'm also taking out extra federal witholdings on that W2 income, so if that's true maybe we're not as far behind as I was fearing.\n\nSince we file as married filing jointly, does it matter which one of us pays the estimated tax? I was talking with one of the finance guys at my employer and he said he didn't think it'd matter that on paper I'm a 60% member and my wife is a 40% member, since at the end of the year when we file, it all gets pooled anyway.",

You can also up w2 withholding at the end of the year, and it is counted as \"timely\" for even quarter one taxes.   \n\n\nIt is best for the payment to be made under the ID of the primary taxpayer on the 1040 form when you file. It can cause delays or glitches if the non primary makes the payment, though I used to do it that way and didn't have issues. I've seen others have the to make a phone call to get the payment properly applied.",

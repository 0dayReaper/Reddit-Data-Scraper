    "postText": "I sold my small business of about 15 years to a larger company. The larger company structured the deal in this way:\n\n- I get ~4 million dollars total, i decided to give almost half to my employees (about 7 of them that wanted to stay) because they\u2019re awesome\n\n- It was an acquihire type deal so they wanted me and my workers to stay\n\n- I get \u201cAsset Payments\u201d - direct payments for my company wired to me, i get these whether i continue to work for the larger company or not\n\n- I get retention payments - I only get this if i stay at larger company or if i\u2019m laid off without cause\n\n- These payments equal ~4mil total and are divided amongst my former employees with me getting about 2mil over a few years.\n\nNow to the complicated part where I don\u2019t even know where to begin researching. The larger company that bought me is now being bought by another company. I asked the company that bought mine what this means to me - all they could tell me was \u201cit depends\u201d because they don\u2019t know exactly what the sale looks like.\n\nSo reddit, what are some likely scenarios for me? I have 1.5 years left of payments that they owe me. As far as I understand if company that bought me is being bought, the new company should take on any contracts or debt. But i\u2019m not sure what kind if tomfuckery they could pull to screw me over (if any). Anybody have any insights into this complicated subject?",

How would i go about collecting compensation from the old company? Well, better question is what does that mean?\n\nThanks again!",

You'd be an easy prey if the counter-party is even a little bit shady.",

If it was an asset purchase, the first acquirer would have paid your company to buy its stuff, and then your company would have had to pay you, the old owner, a dividend.\n\nAs it was likely a share purchase, there are (hopefully) provisions in your original sale agreement that outline how your future payments and retention payments are paid out to you as a result of the second acquisition.\n\nCheck that language.",

Large company acquires, assumes zero debt, debt obligations fall on current company, they either list you as a debtor with obligation to pay, or they simply dont list you as a debtor and you will have to chase your payout. I would do everything in your power to make certain your contract is listed as a debt on the debtors schedule.",

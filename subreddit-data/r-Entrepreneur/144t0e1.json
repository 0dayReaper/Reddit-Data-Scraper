    "postText": "For a while I\u2019ve really wanted to start something in the nonprofit sector, but know it\u2019s pretty much impossible or at a minimum not worth it.\n\nI would like to start a business producing jewelry (namely bracelets) that are aimed at supporting different causes. Each piece would be a different theme/color representing the cause it\u2019s supporting.\n\nThe idea is to make a one stop shop for contributing to causes. An online catalogue with bracelets and such where you know 75% of profits are going to that charity. For example, blue bracelets for ocean restoration, red for wildfires, green for reforestation, etc.\n\nThe user could have the option to open an account and have a simple and manageable way to see their contributions, set recurring donations to charities, etc\n\nGlass recycling in my part of the US is pretty much nonexistent, and I would like to use part of the money to fix this issue. I could see each piece of jewelry incorporating ground glass in the form of sand or some sort which would also raise local awareness.\n\nI have a history in marking and venture startup/market research and am really looking for any large standout issues anyone could think of. Opinions?",

            "comment": "I love the idea of your jewelry pieces contributing to different causes! It's great that you're offering a one-stop-shop for charitable donations that are also fashionable. It's always a win-win! As for the glass recycling issue, perhaps you could consider sourcing ground glass from different companies in-state or nearby states. This could make it easier for you to gather the materials and lower your costs. Keep up the great work!",

            "comment": "The main problem that you're going to run into is that you're competing with the alibabas and temus and dhgates and all the other Chinese manufacturers when it comes to manufacturing and selling non-precious jewelry, and a whole world of jewelry store chains when it comes to precious metals, so finding your niche and pricing it is going to be tricky.\n\nAre you going to manufacture the jewelry? What is the pricing for your raw materials and time  and other costs going to be? Are you going to be able to sell it at a profit? Are you going to be able to demand enough of a profit that you could also sell it wholesale to jewelry retailers?\n\nAre you going to have it manufactured for you offshore, thereby contributing to the packaging waste and CO2 emissions you're trying to reduce?\n\nAre you going to have in manufactured stateside from a manufacturer that can do it cheaply enough for you to have a decent profit margin?\n\nThose are the problems I'd tackle first.\n\nOne thing I might do is get into recycled precious metals. There are people who [recycle computer circuit boards and extract their precious metals from them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJpbKqaKF0) \n\nIf you could offer recycled gold and recycled glass jewelry, you'd be able to command higher pricing, as precious metal jewelry has more of a premium than costume jewelry.\n\nThe real problem is that the amount of actual material you're going to be recycling is probably going to be pretty minimal, but that may not matter if you're planning on giving most of the profits to charity.\n\nYou just need to do the math on your overhead and expected pricing and then see if there's enough demand at a level that will make you a decent profit.",

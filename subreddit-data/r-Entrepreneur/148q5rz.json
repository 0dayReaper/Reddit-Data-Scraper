    "postText": "Day 5 here we go! \n\nHere are my THREE findings of the day.\n\n1/ Insaley Good Recipes \u2192 A $620k+ a year cooking recipe blog\n\n2/ World Data Info \u2192 $156k a year geography data aggregator site\n\n3/ Lottery Corner \u2192 $150k a year website lottery winning numbers tracker\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n#1- InsanelyGoodRecipes. com \n\nPublishing simple (but delicious!) recipes that you can make in 30 minutes or less.\n\nFor those who asked, yes it\u2019s still very much possible to make a killing with blogs. \n\nKim, the lady behind that blog, is proof.\n\n\u2014\nBakeitwithlove. com - is another $24K/ month baking recipe site.\n\nIf I was starting this I would leverage AI to give me recipes and focus on a very specific vertical like Hawaiin Cuisine or Samoan Food.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n#2- Worlddata. info \n\nBanking on The World\u2019s Data\n\nThis site is a clear example of banking with timeless data. They cover everything on their site from the population, timezone, climate, economy, etc\u2026\n\nThe site makes about $156k/ year very passively and is managed by a very lean team.\n\nBusiness model: Display ads - They\u2019re monetizing the traffic they get. \n\nAnother great example of a SIMPLE permissionless site.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n#3- Lotterycorner. com \n\nKeeping people updated with the latest winning numbers in Powerball and Mega Millions.\n\nThere are those who play the lottery hoping to win and others who capitalize by equipping the betters.\n\nThis site is a no-brainer really, there are millions of lottery players in the U.S. so giving them a place to check the winning results is a very logical move.\n\nI imagine they scrape the data somehow and make it live on their site.\n\nThe site gets 1.3M visitors and banks $13K/month. \n\nNot bad at all!\n\n\u2014\u2014\nSee you for day 6",

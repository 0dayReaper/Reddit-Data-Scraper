    "postText": "Most of the packages I send on a daily basis are large and heavy, so UPS is always been my cheapest option.   Shipping is always my biggest expense, usually running about 40-50% of the total cost of my products (I offer free shipping). I'm constantly looking for ways to reduce my cost and thought I would share what I've learned so far. \n\n1.  When you're just starting out, sign up for eBay and apply the eBay discount to your UPS account.  When you have no volume to speak of, it's an easy way to score 17-20% off retail prices. \n\n2.   UPS gives you an unlimited supply of shipping labels.  Easiest way to print labels, especially when you're new, is to use their 8 1/2 x 11 labels. They come two per sheet and fit in a standard printer. \n\n3.  If you have a UPS driver who drops off regularly at your day job, they will gladly take any and all packages you have to ship out. I always bring my daily shipments to work with me and give them to our driver.  Saves time when the alternative is to drive all the way to a UPS store or pay extra to schedule a pick up. \n\n4.  UPS leases Thermal Image Printers for $3 a week.  A good new one is $450 or more. This is a very nice and cheap alternative. \n\n5.  You get free UPS smart pick up for a year when you first sign up.  I don't use this yet, as I have a day job and am not able to have a guy come pick up everyday, but if you are able to it is a huge time saver. \n\n6.  When you get some volume, call UPS and ask to be assigned an account rep.  I'm not huge, shipping maybe 60-80 packages a month which equals about $1300 in monthly spending with them.  I just got assigned an account rep and, after discussing plans for growth and having a very informative discussion with my rep, got my shipping dropped by 20% AND got my residential surcharge fees cut in half.  That is going to save me about $300 and month or more going forward. \n\nThat's all I have for now. I've been doing this for just over a year now could never find any good guides or hacks for shipping in one place.  Thought I would share what I've come across so far. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Let me add!!!!\n\nMake sure UPS knows your account is for a business. \n\nShipping discounts: \n\n\nA UPS rep should call you once they see the new account. You can negotiate rates with them! Suggest a flat rate shipping option. \n\nWe got a flat rate of $9.90 for any box under 900cubic inches and $35 for any box over. Weight limit (either actual or billable) is capped at 150lbs. To give you an example, i can send a 6 foot tall box, 14 x 14 inches and 150 lbs for $45 anywhere in the US. Most of our boxes are $10 tho. \n\nThen negotiate a percentage account so you get a percentage discount for volume. The discount starts at about 20% and goes up if your volume goes up. \n\nDiscount labels:\n\nNext, get yourself a brother laser printer for $100 new online. You buy brother since you can use knock off ink cartridges for $14 which prints about 5000 labels. Once you get the printer, head on over to UPS and request free sticky labels. We got about 400 of them for free the first time. \n\nHope that helps!!!",

Those thermal printers use absolutely no toner!\n\nAlso the ups std zebra 450 can be bought on eBay or on Amazon for a little over 200.  Use them for everything!  \n\nAnother tip, you can use your new discounts for inbound shipping.  You can have your suppliers bill you 3rd party and now you have cheaper inbound shipping. ",

I would do research on toner price before you buy, brother is cheap for us since toner is cheap, i bet they have a color option. Laser is significantly faster too. For 1000s of pages, the printers might be more costly. Personally, I'd push a cheapo one till it died, they are good for 10k plus before major repairs. If you are going over that, commercial printers are the way to go but they are very pricey up front. \n\nSorry I'm not more helpful! Best of luck\n\n",

Call UPS, request new rates, then get those rates, call FedEx, show UPS prices and request discount, then grab those FedEx prices and run to UPS. \n\nWhere I finally ended up is: I told both companies that my shipping system now gets rates from both companies' API and prints the label from the cheapest one. This was the most clever thing I ever did about shipping. Now I just grab a coffee and watch labels print from UPS and next month because of the decreasing volume FedEx panics and adjusts its rates. Labels start to print FedEx. Now I'm wondering what happens if I include USPS into the game.\n\nBTW, My monthly shipping cost is about $80k.",

Most apartments get flagged as automatically signature required at no fee to you.\n\nYou can make agreements where your rates only increase x% per year for y years if you provide a minimum of z volume.\n\nNever select that a package is residential on your own.  They'll automatically flag it if it should be - but that used to be done by the drivers who forget to flag the fee quite often.  Of course they aren't going to automatically revoke the fee if you accidentally flag a commercial delivery as residential.\n\nIf you're going to ship fragile items and file damage claims later make sure you use materials from the shipping company.  They will try to avoid claims by saying your packaging wasn't durable or approved.  You can get your own packaging approved but it's a painful process.\n\nYou automatically get the first $100 insured free on each shipment.  Don't hesitate to file damage claims for $100 in value even if you lost more.",

            "comment": "My issue with UPS, as someone shipping around the same volume:\n\n* check to see if there are UPS drop off counters near you, else youre paying $6 per pick up.  I was not offered free pick-ups when i opened my UPS commercial account.  In my area there arent many places that let people drop off boxes for UPS pickup.  Usps charges nothing for pickups.  Fedex has about the same surcharge for pickup, but at least in my case I've found many many more places to drop off boxes.  \n\n* ups works great -- until it doesn't.   All last year was fine. This year a phantom  $10 fee was added once.  The people at their main number cant answer any question about billing, billing is only handled by one location with shorter hours, no way to email/chat/snailmail Billing so i have a record.   I though they fixed it, but then it reappeared last statement as \"rebill $10\".   I cant get a hold of anyone with the authority to fix this while we're on the line \n\n* last 3 times I had to call the main Ups #, hold times were 20+ minutes and i always get a low level script-reading worker.   My time is valuable, but ups doesnt think so \n\n* do check into Fed Ex.  Rates are comparable to ups so far \n\n* for smaller boxes (maybe 15 lbs or less) USPS may be cheaper. \n\n* definitely set up an account with fedex and ups directly rather than paying retail counter prices.    You probably know this but when it's not an ebay sale, you can also get discounted shipping (usps and ups) on PayPal/shipnow\n\n* for smaller parcels (those going usps)  I'm currently getting the best rates using fitshipper.com -- even better than ebay when it comes to priority mail.  Only down side is it costs  $5/month, but it pays for itself after 8 or 9 Priority shipments.\n\n* [fitshipper ](https://www.fitshipper.com/freeTools/free-shipping-calculators.html) has some free tools you may find helpful.  For example for small items, give it weight and dimensions and it suggests what usps service is cheapest and what Priority boxes might fit.  ",

My laser printer didn't like the free 8.5x11 sheets, the toner would scrape off the labels\n3.  Yes this is a nice feature of UPS but you don't get a receipt, so if your package gets lost you are SOL so I still drop off my packages at a UPS hub and get a receipt, you can probably get a receipt at a UPS store too but I've never used them\n4.  You can buy a used Zebra LP2844 thermal printer for $100-ish on ebay and a box of 12 rolls with 200 4x6 labels for like $65 and they'll last me an eternity",

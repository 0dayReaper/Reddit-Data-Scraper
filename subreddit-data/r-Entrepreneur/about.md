Description:

A community of individuals who seek to solve problems, network professionally, collaborate on projects, and make the world a better place. Be professional, humble, and open to new ideas. 
Our community supports side hustles, small businesses, venture-backed startups, lemonade stands, 1-person-grinds, and most forms of revenue generation! However, no one cares about your blog. Please do not come here to self-promote your consulting, book, podcast, MLM, website, dropshipping guide, or $$$ scheme.

Rules:

No personal attacks: Criticism of ideas, concepts, approaches or plans is welcome. Facing reality is a necessary part of business even when the reality is harsh. Direct written attacks on a person or group of people or picking fights are not and are not allowed in this sub.
Please report threats or harassment under that rule.

Self posts only, links may only provide supplementary material.: Only text posts are allowed, this is to encourage discussion. If you have links to share they must be on topic, described in the text and important for the discussion. Your post must contain enough material on Reddit to have a material discussion.

This specifically means you cannot just post a title without explanatory text and you cannot post just a link (link-dropping). These are assumed to be attempts to use /r/Entrepreneur to generate traffic.

Ten comment karma in /r/Entrepreneur to post: To lead a discussion on /r/Entrepreneur we ask that you have at least 10 comment karma in our sub. This is earned by posting good comments in others' discussions. Doing this reduces spam but more importantly makes sure you understand what the sub can help with, what it will react well to and what would just be ignored or trolled.

No one wins if your post is ignored. Interact a bit and learn about what we can do for you.

No Self Promotion: It is acceptable to cite your sources and provide references to claims, even if this is to your own content/website. However, there should not be an explicit solitication, advertisement, or clear promotion for the intent of awareness. 

Posts must not be made for the primary purpose of selling or promoting yourself, company or service. 

The most acceptable way to share a URL is to use a SPOLIER tag with Reddit's formatting, if you do not, there is a chance your post will be removed.

Avoid unprofessional communication: As a professional subreddit, we expect our community to maintain reasonable decorum. We expect you to treat fellow Entrepreneurs like you would a co-worker. We don't have an H.R., but that is no excuse to be aggressive, foul, or unprofessional. NSFW topics are allowed only if labeled as NSFW. If it doubt label it.

No free offerings threads: Our "Thank You Thursday" threads are reserved for any promotions, offerings, or discounts you have for our community, please do not post free offerings outside of this weekly stickied-thread. If you do your post will be removed.

Follow the Rules of Reddit: [Rules of Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) - They apply everywhere on Reddit. Also consider [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/) The latter isn't mandatory but might be used in considering the intent of your post.

Unsolicited Opinion and Thoughts: Please do not use this community as your personal blog, do not feel compelled to share your opinion with a post, this is not a personal diary where you share your day dreams, thoughts, and opine on subjective concepts. 

Please feel free to provide evidence-based best practices, share a micro-victory, discuss strategy and concepts with a frame work, ask for feedback, and create professional conversation. 

Treat every post as if you're at work and representing the best version of yourself.

No Investment Solicitation: Posts regarding investments in SPECIFIC investments, like cryptocurrency, are NOT allowed. Please don't try to solicit, hype, or otherwise provide investment advice. There are other subreddits better suited for that discussion

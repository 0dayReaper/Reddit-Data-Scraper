    "postText": "So I've been running my e-commerce site for about 5 months now. Selling a few very niche products of my own design and manufacture. I've hit a roadblock recently and don't really know where to go. \n\nLocally, I don't have any availability that I'm aware of to any mentorship in a very specific space like e-commerce. There are about a thousand things that I could use help with. I'm not helpless by any means, but there are some questions I have regarding advertising, site migration, etc that would only be a text message and an answer. \n\nMost online information seems to be more guru type garbage that is directed towards dropshipping than it is building a sustainable and reliable brand. \n\nHas anyone had any luck finding a mentor locally that could nudge them in the right direction? Maybe some resource I might be overlooking?  The products are selling very well and I think it could be extremely successful with just a little guidance. Thanks in advance for any input.",

My latest product, recently released, has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, that potential is an ocean away in the UK primarily. Also Australia is a large market. I need to migrate my site from Godaddy (I know I know) to a site that is more international shipping friendly as Godaddy is not. I have also been approached for distribution deals in both Australia and the UK. No idea how to navigate that. \n\nI think the products have the potential to do about 600-750k in gross sales this year with 90% profit margins. I am a one man show and am currently keeping up (though sleep deprived while working a full time job) and feel if I can get someone be aggressively advertising, sales could be more consistent. I'm at a pivotal point.",

You might want to look at an e-commerce fulfillment company that works within UK and Australia although things may change dramatically once a distribution deal is inked.  One thing is clear, you need to expand your team as just a one man show is no longer sustainable.  This is a good thing, your business is successful and needs to be scaled up to meet demand.",

Working out of my creepy basement with an office that used to hold coal for the furnace of the house doesn't seem like the most glamorous place to bring someone into. I do all of the product assembly, packing, fulfillment, etc so it's getting overwhelming. Weird to consider bringing someone else on while still working a full time job. It pays too well to quit without a longer track record of success. However, I do have other real estate businesses which generate good income so I wouldn't be destitute if this goes sideways. Getting pulled in a lot of different directions.",

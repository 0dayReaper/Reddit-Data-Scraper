If it was rainy the next, I could shift most work to that day.  I had 3, sometimes 4 day weekends every week.    \n\nThe business grew.  It went up.  It went down.  I hired a few people.

Even YT isnt passive income, i used to put alot of hours into making the videos but its semi passive but still, if you dont upload weekly or daily you wont keep anyone interested.\n\nIf i was you, i would ask myself, what do i enjoy and what do i not enjoy. Following what you love is a game changer since doing work for something you are passionate about becomes a hobby, im just as excited going to play football as i am going to work on my business",

            "comment": "Here is my journey. \n\n2009: Tired of corporate IT security and software analysis. I started designing websites in my living room. Which grew to fixing computers. Wife got upset because our living room turned into a computer shop. Rented a small room in the basement of a friends insurance business. Stayed there for a year. Did not spend a dime on advertising. Word of mouth, good service and good prices. After that year, I reached about $10K a month and could afford a strip mall shop. Got into the strip and went well for a year. \n\n2012: Wife ran away, company crumbled. cried for six months. Then I met a woman who reminded me that being an entrepreneur doesn't mean to give up. \n\nLater that year: I open a new shop and rebuild my customer base. I personally call every single customer I ever had. Business goes up to about $100K a month. \n\n2013: I bring in a VP with a 5yr contract for 30% ownership. I open another store and he run that one. Conspires with a store manager to steal everything. Bankrupts company due to customer losses. \n\n2014: sell everything and move to Asia. Fix my head and my heart. \n\n2015: Move back and learned from my mistakes. Built back up.\n\n2016: added business solitions.\n\n2017: started a health product wholesale company. \n\n2019: last year.... Grossed $4.9M across the board.\n\nMoral of the story. Never give up. If something goes wrong, it's not failure. It's a learning experience. Japanese manufacturing philosophies really helped too.  Also never get too big a head. I still pick up trash in the parking lot if I see it. Also get to know your employees names. Understand who they are. If they need more money, figure out how you can adjust some of their income to performance.",

If you work for yourself, your boss is your client, because if they aren't happy with your work, you don't get paid. \"Not having a boss\" is a marketing hook.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people arguing semantics about what constitutes having a boss. So in the interest of clear discussion, I view it in the lens of being accountable to a third party. Market forces, customers, clients, supply and demand - you can be accountable to all of them. But if you are trying to avoid specifically answering to one guy in a corporate ladder, then that's valid too.",

One house I lived in had a hole in the floor for a toilet. This isn\u2019t what we may be used to, but it\u2019s actually normal in other countries. \n\nBut I did it. Now, while my friends from college are working 50+ hours a week to make over six figures, I am able to by working 40-hr weeks with summers off (middle school math teacher)\n\nI saved as much as possible and invested in rental properties for 10 years. The first few, I did alone. But when I married my gf, she out all her saved money into the houses too and we were able to increase our investments. Plus. The rent snowballed as well and now we have 9 houses, living in one, and renting out 7 at any given time. \n\nI made 20k in the month of June never working more than 4-6hrs a week (side gig tutoring students). I do have another income stream via swing trading (summer thing because I can\u2019t check stocks all day when I\u2019m at school)",

I wouldn't say I'm never answering to a boss again but I still have clients etc. I don't work as many hours as my friends, and can sleep in if I want to.i Make my own schedule. Finally put away some savings (I spent all of mine after I quit my first job lol). Wouldn't say I'm well off but our rent for the year is paid, and my money is aged 90 days or so (thanks to budgeting realistically for the last 3 years), and have started turning down lower paying projects. We can take a vacation pretty much whenever we want to (but not like Maldives style business class stuff) and we still travel on a budget. But it's also a lifestyle we enjoy plus we're not huge on shopping (well my SO is but I'm not) and we always try to live within our means. Neither of us use credit cards. Neither of us splurge on stupid shit. Neither of us have dependents (tho I do send a bit of money to my grandparents every month).\n\nHaving extra money would be nice sometimes but I'd rather live like this than grind 40-60 hrs a week again like I used to.",

I'm lucky to both live in a great city for music and make a good income gigging playing bass which has allowed me to meet &amp; perform with a lots of musicians. \n\nLocal open mics are a great spot to hit, especially if you're like me and own a small home studio that isn't the most professional. Those musicians are usually newer to the music scene and don't have the budget to go to a high end studio. \n\nI'd also recommend putting together a portfolio. Working with a few clients for free or really cheap to get a reference for others to understand your brothers skill set will help a lot. Promote those on IG and Facebook to try and expand your business.\n\nI'm personally in the middle of creating a new \"band\" called cloud[FOREST] to get my name out as a staple in my community as a music producer. I'm putting together a 4 song EP where I compose the entire thing (shows my composition/production skills) then I'm having a different local artist sing on each track. This is to both further my network connections in the area and to more or less show off what I'm able to do for singer/songwriters music if they were to hire me. I'm not sure how effective this plan will be but if it doesn't pay off I'll just try something new. Tell your brother good luck and keep trying towards it!",

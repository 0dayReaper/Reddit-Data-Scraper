    "postText": "Or is it even legal to avoid using my real name, despite any possible legal ramifications being they could access that with information requests to the transfer service I would be using?\n\nExample: PayPal, I would HAVE to display my full name for someone to pay me for things they commission (and yes, I'd take the financial/time risk of providing my end BEFORE payment).\n\nLike, sure, if someone has a beef with me, I don't want to \"hide\" or anything from such but I just don't like my name being so openly available otherwise. I just don't have a lot of trust in some people in this day and age.\n\nI ask this because I obviously need to match my name with the name on my banking information.\n\nIf I'm being too paranoid and that there is no real way to set up a money transfer service so that customers are only shown my BRAND name as display and not my REAL name, by all means, let me have 'er and berate me for my brain thinking this is perfectly normal.",

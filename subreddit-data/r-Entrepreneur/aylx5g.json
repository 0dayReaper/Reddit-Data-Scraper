    "postText": "Wasn't sure if this should go on r/confessions or here, but figured i'd share.\n\n5 years ago I was bored at work (tech sales) and was browsing craigslist for services needed and came across a post about needing a valet company for a private party.  I thought to myself, I could do that!  So I replied and said I had a valet company (I did not know the first thing about valet companies) and soon after I was heading to their house to have a meeting about logistics.  It was a huge house in a  very wealthy neighborhood ($4M+ house), and this very nice husband and wife greeted me and said they were planning a graduation party for their son and parking was limited (house on a hill) and would need valet.  I asked how many cars were expected,  where we could park, times, etc and said i'd check with my \"team\" and get right back to them.  \n\nI then called a few valet companies and told them I was a party planner for a wealthy family and needed a valet service.  I explained that I would be their main point of contact and to please ask their staff not to speak to the owner.  I provided the details and decided on the one that had the most reasonable prices and seemed legit (had insurance etc) and they sent me an invoice.  The total for this service was $1,000 for 5 hours and 7 guys.  So I created my own invoice, fake letter head, etc for $3,000.  I sent it to the \"client\" and had no idea how they would respond to the price and not a few minutes later he said \"perfect!\" and I was stoked.  I took a deposit (personal check made out to me) to pay the valet deposit, etc.\n\nThe day of the event was stressful.  The owner of the house thought I owned this valet company and the valet company thought I was a party planner!  I kept going between the two to make sure that the right hand never talked to the left.  At one point the actual owner of the valet company stopped by and I told him his guys were rockstars and got him out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nThe event was a huge success. The valet guys were awesome to hang out with. I basically just hung out, ran a few cars myself and gave them all the tips.  The plan was executed perfectly.\n\nAfter the event I came back to get my check and the wife had made me a huuuge goodie bag of food from the party (indian familu and Indian food i'd never had before.  Was amazing).  Told me how great we did, and all the compliments from their guests, etc.\n\nAfter that day I did a lot of research on valet companies, the market, the margins, and almost started a business but ultimately decided not to pursue it.\n\nAnyways, that's how you make $2k in a day.  Always remember kids, there is money to be made a million different ways if you get a little creative and put your mind to it. \n\nMy only regret... looking back at this picture of his house, I should have told him I also owned a roofing company :) :)\n\nPic here: Valet for a day https://imgur.com/gallery/XB8tzFQ\n\n\nEDIT:  Wow, crazy amount of comments and positivity. As a new member here, this is sweet!\n\nOne point of clarity for \"Fake Invoice\".  I didn't mimic the valet company, or pretend to be another company.  Not even sure why I used the word \"fake\". It was a real invoice.  I don't have a copy at this point but it likely said \"\nLetterhead \n\"MY NAME VALET SERVICES\"  \nDate\nEvent \nSERVICES: VALET/PARKING 5 HOURS (start/end)\nTOTAL COST OF SERVICE\nDEPOSIT \n\nTHANK YOU\"\n\nIf that is considered fraud then color me igloo.\n",

They are the ones that build houses, do major renovations, etc.  They make sure people show up and the job is done.  And as you found out, there are also subcontractors.  This is pretty normal in the US. The biggest reasons this exists in the US is money/job arbitration and language ability.  A contractor only gets paid after the whole job is done, but the workers demand pay usually at the end of day. A lot of workers don't have good English skills, so they rely on contractors/subcontractors to communicate design requirements.",

I especially get the value in separating sales and marketing and allowing the two separate entities work together to create value through independent synergy. In your example, especially, since many workers value a lot by outsourcing marketing efforts to others and they just accept the job and focus on what they do best. \n\nHowever with the scenario I described there is little to no value adding along the chain. It\u2019s as close to rent seeking as you can possibly get while still having a technical out. Because what happens here is the labor ends up being able to not compete because the superior and more aggressive marketers take over all platforms. So they become reliant on the marketing middle man to get by. So they have to subsequently take what they can get which means discounted job rates. Meanwhile the consumer pays more because the middle man not only pays less for the job to the laborer, but more to the consumer. \n\nThe value they add is minimal at best. All they do is add an additional link in the chain which demands a profit as well, which they have to pull out from both consumer and labor. ",

The owner will hire the general contractor. This person sometimes will do all the \"general\" work such as demo, framing walls and floors, etc. Sometimes they won't do any of the actual construction at all. They will then bid out the more specialty trades. MEP, casework, etc. These people will even bid out even further. The electricians will bid out to the lighting vendors. The casework vendor will bid out for one company to provide the hardware for the casework, one company will build the casework, another company to install it. In a large project you could easily have dozens of companies. Each level will charge more than the one below it. The value might not be seen to you but it's there. Having to manage a project takes ***a lot*** of work. Being able to pass that work down is very beneficial. Not only does it lighten your load, it also makes sure that more attention is paid. Less things fall through the cracks. \n\nThis also completely skips the fact that the company was basically acting as a marketing company. Which sounds like less work - having to seek out every job you do or having someone arrange for every job? The answer is pretty obvious. In your specific situation the added value was that they were acting as a middle man. The home owner didn't need to take the time (which means money) to seek out someone to do the job, someone was contacting them and getting the job arranged. For the owner, they didn't need to spend time (which also means money) marketing, they were able to get work sent to them instead. Is the middle man necessary here? Of course not. The home owner could be contacting contractors. The contractors could be contacting home owners. But there was someone willing to do both of those jobs. And that's the added value - their time in arranging everything.",

That means they sue you and you're on the hook to defend yourself. Which, since you did no due-diligence around who you hired, means you'd likely go bankrupt just paying for the lawyer's fees yourself.\n\nAnd to those who say \"Just sue the valet company\" sure, that's the next step but it still costs money. If you got sued for $10MM (easy in wrongful death, unknown cars are being driven) and then tried to sue the valet company for the same amount, I don't even know if you'd have standing since it wasn't you affected directly by the WD. And if you could sue, attorney's fees (which usually aren't recoverable) would bankrupt you as well.\n\nTL;DR You gambled with your financial future and bankruptcy to make $2k. Not the first but plenty of people have figured out \"what could go wrong\" very quickly and with disastrous ends.",

I really don't, but arbitrage is used in trading securities, in retail, in services, and just about anywhere a free market exists that may have imperfect knowledge.\n\nBasically, any time an asset holder may not know the fair market value of their asset, and a prospective asset buyer also may not know the fair market value of the asset, there is an opportunity for arbitrage.\n\nArbitrage involves a middle party knowing that they can acquire an asset at a lower price from a seller that doesn't know how high they could price their asset, and resell it to a buyer who doesn't know how little they could be paying for it.\n\nAn arbitrager simply needs to know the pricing for the supply and then go shop the prospective asset around at a higher price and when they get a sale, obtain the asset from the seller quickly and mark it up.\n\nThis is a topic on Retail Arbitrage, where you buy things from outlet stores and resell them online to people who can't be bothered to hunt for deals at outlet stores:\nhttps://mywifequitherjob.com/8-ecommerce-business-models-compared/#Retail_Arbitrage\n\nYou can do the same thing at garage/estate sales, between niche and general markets, or even between cryptocurrency exchanges.",

From there I could go any number of directions with a promising career path.  I started with a base of 33k and unlimited commission and made six figures my second year. I can also tell you that a majority of the folks that started with me eventually quit and probably still make 33k a year.  Just being in tech sales doesn't mean you'll make money, it all depends on you.  Technology should sell itself.  Clients need technology and they're going to buy technology, but they're going to buy it from people they like.  If you don't feel like you have a career path, it's a great industry with a ton of perks.  ",

(I come from the VAR side for clarity in my position/statement) I also have a team of super smart engineers that will support the scope and design for the client.

So the client is going to be buying from the people they like (in extremely simple terms), since I represent all possible types of technologies and manufacturers.  (uc, cloud, security,  networking, infrastructure, etc etc).  But you're right, beyond the relationship aspect.. solving problems, creative thinking, providing timely education and updates to your client, leveraging resources, etc, are all huge components to being successful in tech sales.  If you're not in a position to represent multiple technologies and can only represent one, make sure it's not a shitty one :).",

Consultants don't actually do any physical work, people unknowingly pay them to go out and hire contractors to get the work done. Is it illegal or unethical? It depends how much you have to lie to your customers. If you're upfront about it and everyone knows you're outsourcing the work and you're only being paid for your expertise, it's probably OK. If you convince people you're physically going to do work for them and you go out of your way to hide what you're actually doing, that's fraud.\n\nReminds me of Rob Wolchek's investigation of florist outsourcing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g-emGWsKc4",

I made sure the company I hired was legit, and I ensured that everything was as expected (another reason I stayed from start to finish).

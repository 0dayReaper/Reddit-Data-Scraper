    "postText": "Hello everyone! I have a question that I would love to ask into the void: What does the technical Due Diligence usually look like when people do M&amp;A (especially micro M&amp;A and such)? How do they ensure that they are not buying an unmaintainable, absolute hacked together piece of architecture that will cost them a fortune to maintain/rewrite? Please don't tell me that it is done purely through questionnaires like many cyber insurance companies are doing it today.",

            "comment": "There are firms that specialize in doing technical due diligence as part of M&amp;A.  Any reasonable investor will hire one along with the usual QofE, tax, legal, etc. diligence work streams.  \n\nMost firms will ask for some data - diagrams, hardware inventory, open source packages, code platforms, etc. and then will do q&amp;a to attempt to understand what\u2019s been built/how it\u2019s constructed and how maintainable the code is.  Some will even do a code review if requested by the buyer.  It\u2019s surprisingly not that difficult to determine whether or not a platform is poorly constructed by talking to those closest to it.  If during diligence the seller isn\u2019t truthful, there\u2019s insurance that typically will kick in to cover the liability.",

            "comment": "As someone who works in M&amp;amp;A, I can say that technical due diligence is a serious business. We usually have a team of experts assess the target company's architecture, codebase, development practices, etc. to ensure that the acquisition makes sense. It's definitely not just a questionnaire!",

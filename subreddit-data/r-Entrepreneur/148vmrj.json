    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my experience with starting an Amazon FBA business using the wholesale model. I found it to be a great way to get into business and build quickly. However, I'm having some trouble staying profitable and I'm hoping some of you can offer some advice or share your experiences.\n\nFirstly, I've found it really challenging to find products with low enough costs and still have adequate demand. I've mostly been using telegram distributors to find deals, but I find that the products always end up selling for much less than they were when I purchased them. Resulting in a price war to the bottom. Any tips on how to source products more efficiently would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAdditionally, I have given up on LTL shipments as they seem to just take way to long and even though they are cheaper it is a headache to just get the product to amazon. Sometimes takes 5-6 weeks.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying the freedom and potential of running my own business, but finding it difficult to overcome some of these challenges. Thank you all in advance for any guidance or insight you can offer.",

            "comment": "I think it can work but it will become a crowded market very quickly. There is still always going to be people who go to Fiverr or Upwork instead of paying $500-5000 a month and just pay peanuts for one off projects. The real struggle is going to be once you figure out how to package and offer your premium service, how do you go about finding clients willing to pay for it?\n\nThe creator of DesignJoy even mentioned that he got lucky on ProductHunt and blew up because his friends helped upvote him and he doesn\u2019t recommend anyone try to do that. I wonder why\u2026 probably because he got lucky and most people won\u2019t.\n\nIt can work but you will have to be your own marketer and prepared to put a lot of time into bringing in new clients which will eventually topple over into the time that you need to spend actually completing the work.",

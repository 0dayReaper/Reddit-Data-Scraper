    "postText": "4 Years ago I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/sblc6/from_an_idea_to_replacing_my_fulltime_salary_in_4/) about me making $4k per month and then turned it into a [case study](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/tltuy/day_26_from_zero_to_website_launcha_recap_of/) on how to build local service businesses. A couple hundred people from Reddit followed along to build companies and those companies now do a combined $50 million per year! \n\nIf you want to start something in 2017, I've updated the case study a bit below.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: This is local service business.  Not sexy enough for most of you and that's fine. But I have not found a more predictable path to building a million dollar business than this and I\u2019ve built [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/), [successful](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3r8hzo/so_were_now_over_2_million_per_year_in_combined/), [businesses](https://launch27.baremetrics.com/) so far.\n\n**WHY LOCAL SERVICES?**   \nFrankly, there is a TON of money to be made.  \n\nThese are huge markets in terms of $$$.  However, unlike regular e-commerce companies where you are competing with the best internet marketing people in the world, with local services you're competing with just the people in your neighborhood, most of whom do not understand internet marketing at all.\n\nAnd on top of this we come with a crazy advantage with online booking that 99% of the companies don't have.  Imagine a store that sells simple things but for some reason nobody in the industry allows you to purchase online. Well a bunch of redditors are changing that in cities all around the world, and crushing it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why we have been able to take such a big chunk out of the industry so quickly.   My goal is for this network to grow from $50 million a year to $1 billion in the next 5 years. I think it\u2019s possible. \n\nA few screenshots from some of the folks that followed along...\n\nHere\u2019s [one guy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2609k624qj2qc9/Screenshot%202016-12-31%2014.02.02.png?dl=0), and [another](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v73zcagsengj90x/Screenshot%202016-12-31%2022.04.30.png?dl=0) , and [another](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ftvsk3w0knnifo/Screenshot%202016-12-31%2014.04.58.png?dl=0),  and [another](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3eapt4but2f5j3k/Screenshot%202016-12-31%2014.06.09.png?dl=0), and [another](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1qx5hegko6wk29/Screenshot%202016-12-31%2022.03.32.png?dl=0), and [another](https://www.dropbox.com/s/029u38n5iyzeb9r/Screenshot%202016-12-31%2015.59.14.png?dl=0 ) ...shoot the last one was launched by a 19 year old kid, they got to $2mil per year in 2 \u00bd years. Shoot, it took me 3 years to get $2mil per year. Bastards! haha\n\nWhen you add all the companies up,  it\u2019s $50 million per year and most started less than 3 years ago. I have the raw data for that $50 million number btw, and we're working with someone from r/dataisbeautiful to go through it and create something to compare revenues, figure out growth rates, correlations with city sizes etc. Will make another post on that when it's done in a week or two.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**WILL THIS WORK FOR EVERYONE?**\n\nNope. But if you have hustle and been trying to come up with \u201cbusiness ideas\u201d or haven\u2019t figured out that sexy mobile app you\u2019ve been dreaming about, then read on for how to build the most annoying (yet fast growing company) you can imagine.\n\nThis isn't just me saying this btw, the [fastest growing Ycombinator company](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/341229908078501890) (before they jacked it up) was also a home cleaning company. \n----------------\n\n**OKAY ON TO THE CASE STUDY: HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY START SOMETHING IN 2017**   \nBefore you get started:\nTry to do just do one thing per day, even if it\u2019s just reading an article, or it will get overwhelming. This is going to be a slow steady candle burning, not a quick passionate flash fire that burns out. Here goes:\n\n**Sunday, Jan 1st, 2017**\nThat's today. Do nothing. Just chill, let the alcohol wear off, and relax.  The next 30 days will be sick!!!\n--\n**Monday Jan 2nd: Choose Your Industry**\nWake up, eat a good breakfast and get ready to crush 2017.  Choose one, listed here in order of likelihood of success in my opinion: Home cleaning, carpet cleaning, home painting, lawncare, laundry.  I've also seen people do well with mobile car detailing, dog walking, and others. Simple local services, but we'll be doing NONE of the actual work! I\u2019m going to assume home cleaning for simplicity for this guide, but you can interchange that with almost any local service you can imagine. \n--\n**Tuesday Jan 3rd: Use Yelp to check out the competition** \nCheck out your competition on Yelp by searching for 1 star reviews. Goal is to not repeat the things your competition keeps getting wrong. [Watch this video on analyzing the competition](https://vimeo.com/168825231). \n--\n**Wednesday Jan 4th: Adding Value**\n Easy day. Spend the day thinking about customer service and how you will add value to the industry.  The goal is a long term successful business that does not repeat the issues your competitors have problems with. [Watch this video on adding value](https://player.vimeo.com/video/169029792). \n--\n**Thursday Jan 5th: Create Your One Page Business Plan**  \nThe days of the 60 page business plan is over.  Fill this [bad boy](http://100startup.com/resources/business-plan.pdf) out as a simple guide.  We'll come back to this as you get more information. [Watch this video on the one page business plan](https://player.vimeo.com/video/169326919). \n--\n**Friday Jan 6th: Choose a domain**  \nI typically use [this site](http://www.leandomainsearch.com/ ) for domain ideas. I like to create domains that have one keyword in the domain and then one sexy word for human beings. Example: Lawn Tribe.  That way both Google and Humans understand what you're offering.  [Watch this video on us choosing a domain](https://player.vimeo.com/video/169184529).\n--\n**Saturday Jan 7th: Branding**  \nGood looking people get more breaks in life. Same for good looking websites. Launch with a good looking brand that looks more like a startup than an old school company. The goal is to have the most professional site in your industry in your city. Just spend the day googling around for your service in your city and looking at their websites.  \n--\n**Sunday Jan 8th: Chillaxing Day**  \nGo for a run, or bullshit a bit on reddit, or whatever you do to unwind. So far not much has happened, but next week things will start to ramp up and you'll need a mental break.\n--\n**Monday Jan 9th: Planning the website**\nSo we need to get a good looking site. Three choices:\n1) Get a cheap wordpress theme and tweak it. 2) Buy a more expensive but [ready-to-go theme](http://demo.themestreet.net/launch27/index.html) that is already branded beautifully (if we do say so ourselves)  2) Most expensive: Get something built yourself. I personally like 99designs for homepage design and created a guide on how to get good outcomes there:  \n\nStep 1: Setting up the contest: https://vimeo.com/147716915  \nStep 2: Marketing the contest: https://vimeo.com/147716917  \nStep 3: Finding Inspiration sites: https://vimeo.com/147716918  \nstep 4: Managing the contest: https://vimeo.com/147716916  \nStep 5: Wrapup and handover https://vimeo.com/147716914  \n  \nBottom line is, I don't launch any projects with ugly design.\n--\n**Tuesday Jan 10th: Copywriting**  \nYou have to write engaging content for your website. For the top section make sure the customer knows where you do business: Things like \u201cPremier Maid Service in Los Angeles\u201d or \u201cYou Deserve a clean home in Nevada\u201d. You get the gist.  The goal is casual and fun copywriting for the entire site. Watch this video on [our copywriting efforts](https://player.vimeo.com/video/169960700). \n--\n**Wednesday Jan 11th: Building Trust**  \nThere are few little things we want to incorporate, that this video covers. Trust is the currency of the internet.  We can't build a successful company without certain trust factors on the site like human faces, trust icons, etc.  [Watch this video on how we build trust](https://vimeo.com/170150848). \n--\n**Thursday Jan 12th: Pricing**  \nWe\u2019re going for simple online booking, that's one of our major competitive advantages, so keep in mind we have to have a pricing structure that works. Here\u2019s [something](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/slrip/day_9_pricing_mindset_layer_on_value_and_charge/) to read on pricing from the original case study.  [In this video we discuss how we figured out pricing](https://player.vimeo.com/video/170611257).\n--\n**Friday Jan 13th: Building a form for hiring**  \nThe goal here is to throw up ads to find service providers and have them fill out a form on your website that you can then use to follow up.  You can use something like www.groovehiring.com (my company) to have people apply on your website.  You want to present a nice landing page that looks professional and groovehiring helps with that. [This is what it looks like]( https://maidsinblack.groovehiring.com/).  Check this video out for some more [info at the 1 minute mark](https://player.vimeo.com/video/170939041).\n--\n**Saturday Jan 14th: Choosing the right people**  \nHow to choose the right folks on craigslist. [Read this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4FnAwoX2XXNO3JXQNLpgYLHvbSylRTqmkBWTEGRZ9E/edit?usp=sharing) and for how to reward them, [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/siknh/day_6_find_your_superstars_quickly_and_reward_them/). \n--\n**Sunday Jan 15th: Chill out!**  \nSome good games on today if you're a football fan.  Take it easy and rest your brain if you can.  Next week we start to line things up for launch.\n--\n**Monday Jan 16th: Our Marketing Channels**  \nHere's our marketing Channels and how we\u2019ll be making money. There are a ton of places to get customers and we'll show more in a few days, but for now, watch this video to start to get [familiar with marketing channels](https://player.vimeo.com/video/171823571).  \n--\n**Tuesday Jan 17th: Adding a video to your website**  \nThis isn't necessary but it defintely helps you stand out. Watch this video of [Dara creating her video for her website](https://player.vimeo.com/video/172659641). \n--\n**Wednesday Jan 18th: Set up live chat and other ways to contact you**  \nSet up live chat (Tawk.to is free and great) and consider a popup to capture emails.  We use phone.com for phones but there are plenty of tools out there. [This vid has a bit on email capture](https://player.vimeo.com/video/174447486). \n--\n**Thursday Jan 19th: Thumbtack**  \nWe're not launched yet but this will be important for us to figure out, out of the gate:\nHere's[ how to get clients on Thumbtack](https://player.vimeo.com/video/148259895), and here is Dara\u2019s first shot. It worked out in the end, but here\u2019s [how the first stab went](https://player.vimeo.com/video/176684841) for some real world angst. \n--\n**Friday Jan 20th: Thumbtack Day 2**  \nThumbtack will be important for us for our early jobs, check out [this video for more Thumbtack strategies](https://player.vimeo.com/video/178078135). \n--\n**Saturday Jan 21st: Gift Cards, discount codes, etc.**  \nGift cards, discount codes, and other ecommerce tools. Just familiarize yourself online with techniques ecommerce folks use to increase conversions and grow revenue using ecommerce tools. Everything here you\u2019ll get from www.launch27.com\n--\n**Sunday Jan 22nd: CHILLAX**  \nTrump is now president, and Facebook is probably going crazy with memes and stories. You'll need this day. Trust me!\n--\n**Monday Jan 23rd: Get set up to take credit cards**  \nSign up at stripe.com to get a stripe account. This will be the credit card processing company that allows your customers to book online with ease.  We use stripe because it integrates perfectly with the booking form we'll be using.\n--\n**Tuesday Jan 24th: Sign up at Launch27** (Full disclosure: I\u2019m an owner)  \nThis is going to be the software that runs the entire business, from booking form, to recurring bookings, to credit card integration, to customer database, the entire shebang. The booking form you get here you will add to your website with a simple copy and paste.  \n\n\"Oh wait, so this is just selling shovels in a gold rush?\" Yeah. A gold rush where I've already figured out how to pan the gold myself, made millions there, showed other people how to do it and a lot of them are making millions as well, and then 2 years later I created a shovel that simplifies the entire process.  And in this gold rush, the gold just happens to be fairly predictable and easy to pan. :-) \n--\n**Wednesday Jan 25th to Sunday the 29th**  \nLast minute checks, launch27 integration, logo upload, business set up, contracts etc.\n--\n**Monday Jan 30th. Launch Day!**  \nThis is 1 month from now.  And that's how we build businesses. From idea to launch in 30 days.  Watch this video for some tips on [how we get our first customers](https://player.vimeo.com/video/181279143).  Cycle through this list as well, there are a ton of ways here that [have been shown to be solid for getting clients](http://www.rohangilkes.com/day-10-how-to-develop-a-list-of-marketing-channels/).  \n--\nYep, it\u2019s hard. \n\nOne month of hard work, but in 30 days you can start making money instead of dreaming about that fancy mobile app that you\u2019ve been planning out for the last 2 years!\n\nCOSTS:\nDomain: $10  \nHosting: $10 per month  \nTheme: $450 (website)  \nLaunch27: $59 per month  \nFrom here on out if you can budget $300 per month for marketing it would be a win.  (That\u2019s like eating out money and cable/cell phone bill )  \n\nCore customers will come from: Yelp, Adwords (hire someone), Thumbtack, Craigslist, local seo, and others.  Will come back on February 1st to continue this if enough folks give it a shot.  \n\n**BUILD SOMETHING IN 2017**  \nAt the end of the day build something! If not this, find something else. But there's no excuse to be hanging out in r/entrepreneur for years without working on something.\n\nMakes no sense :-)\n\nKnowing you guys really well, I know there are a ton of excuses you've already created for why this won't work. I wrote this: [The Top 12 Wantrepreneur excuses on how to get past them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4ivuhb/the_top_12_wantrepreneur_bullshit_excuses_and_how/). \n\nGood luck and AMA\n\nP.S. Want to add this as someone said I make it sound too easy.  Business is risky. Anyone that tells you otherwise has never started a business. It's incredibly difficult, subject to fail, will make you overweight sitting at a computer, will give you high blood pressure and anxiety if you're not careful, and it is incredibly difficult to find customers (and shoot sometimes even more difficult to have those customers pay you when you're done). Nothing about business is easy, otherwise EVERYBODY would be doing. It takes an almost insane person to take on trying to make it in the world with their own two hands and take on ALL the responsibility for the livelihoods of a lot of people. Just keeping it real! This is hard, but doable, because a ton of people have done it, but it's not for everyone by any means.  Not everyone is cut out for entrepreneurship to begin with and certainly not everyone is cut out for local services and dealing with human beings. Good luck. \n\nIf you want additional training on this and be on weekly calls with me as you set this up go here: https://programs.overthinkacademy.com/register?buynow=yes",

            "comment": "Getting a few reports on this so I thought I would recognize the issues raised and make sure everyone knows what is going on.\n\n**Reports about self-promotion and spam:** u/localcasestudy owns launch27.com and Groovehiring which he points out.  These sites provide services for service booking businesses. When you read his posts please keep in mind he does have cause to favor it - but he also points that out himself (\"...if we do say so ourselves..\"). People doing AMAs are allowed to provide a modest number of links to their company if it is material to their AMA which certainly seems to be the case here. Given that guideline, given that there are no affiliate links in the OP and given the relative amount of information to links I don't think the post would qualify as spam, particularly given ongoing involvement in Q&amp;A. One other concern might be if the video content were all self-promotional. I will be reviewing the videos shortly but given the titles/descriptions I don't expect them to be simply cloaked sales pitches for real information.\n\n**One report was for threatening and harassing.** There doesn't seem to be anything like that in the OP. If you were serious about this report please contact the mods. If a comment was harassing please report that specific comment so we can investigate. \"Harassing\" means attacks on you as a person it does not mean saying something you disagree with or attacking your concepts, thoughts or position on issues. Criticism is fair game. Name-calling or worse is not. We take these type of reports very seriously but reporting something as threatening to try to raise alarm level when it is not is just as serious. Only use this type of report if you are being harassed or threatened.\n\n\n---\nEdit: So this post explaining why I did what I did has now been reported as \"Mod team are shills\" and \"Fucking stupid.\" Everyone is free to respond to this post and point out why I am wrong. I listen to that and consider it. If you make a solid case I will change my position on things. It is important to me to be logical and rational and that means recognizing I can be wrong. \n\n---\nEdit: I'm asking the other mods to take a look and review the post to find out if I was in error making this a sticky as an AMA and to make sure I am not being biased in evaluating the reports. I would much prefer a discussion of why people see this as an ad rather than an AMA (yes, I do understand the formatting suggests ad and the phrasing feels marketing but when I drill down to look at how much is actually promotion I see promotion of a concept rather than a service. Haven't reviewed the videos yet though.) Please tell me how I am wrong. I will be reviewing the back and forth both in this post and others.\n\n---\nEdit: So a fair number of the reports seem to be saying it is improper to have this stickied. One asked how much I was paid to sticky it (nothing incidentally, I thought it would qualify to be stickied under our past AMA guidelines). Since that was just my call and since I've asked the broader mod team to review it I will be unstickying it until they do so and decide how to go. **Was it a mistake for me to sticky it? I think so but not for the reasons you might think.** I think it was acceptable to do so under our policies for AMAs but I don't think that it helped the community. The post was already visible to everyone because of the supporting upvotes it had received. Stickying it just pissed off people who didn't want to see it. I didn't see that coming and apologize for missing it and doing the wrong thing. Trying to help and failed. Sorry",

I think you're making the classical error of finding ways to convince yourself not to do something.\n\nI'm personally quite comfortable with setting up clients, resources and regular income and worrying about the red tape when it needs to be done.

There are two demos in this business: One time purchases and recurring purchases.  Purchases (both one timea nd recurring) cost the same,  about $40 to acquire, so margins can be tighter on one time. However recurring services are where the money is made here and this really moves the lifetime value.  We have folks that have been with us for the entire 4 years and we're there every week. So if you were to do a weighted average across the two demos you're at about $1,200 or so because recurring makes up the biggest revenue you'll be booking in any week.  ",

The start of any company will require you to be a bit resourceful.  For more detailed questions, there are entire groups of service providers hanging out in forums etc.  I would join them and ask how they've solved some of these issues.  \n",

Doing this simultaneously became impossible so she started a very 'traditional' cleaning service. She hired nobody initially. She advertised on CL and targeted specific areas where homes were close together (gated type communities). Almost immediately she had demanded increase. She hired one person on a week to week basis, took the projected hit in profit, and two months later hired two more resources, a ft driver, and spent 80% of her time managing schedules and doing sales (estimates). Six months later, 7 more employees and another driver. I'm not saying this is absolute for anyone but it worked. She built the company for the next 4 years, and then divided and sold equal parts off. I'm purposely not including opex nightmares and mistakes- obviously, but she had a net income of $115k (mostly cash) after expenses for the last three years she operated the business. And while she probably sold off at a loss (value was likely higher than she sold for), she finished her degree, and is back in the workforce doing what she intended. She's no genius. She isn't technically astute, and she didn't have half the tools that OP is offering up here. ",

Many of your competitors have 5 stars with 50+ reviews.  What's the main reason for the lower reviews with your companies?  \n\nPlease don't take this as any knock on you or your businesses. I just think that most of us see you as the gold standard for service businesses and if this is an area you are struggling with it would be really difficult for those of us looking to start.

Shoot I know one city that now has 3 million dollar companies.  \n3) The more people that get involved allows me to also build up the infrastructure around the industry and I and other redditors (marketing/sales/call centers/apps) make money that way as well.  \n4) It's an upturned middle finger to the powers that be (VCs, Incubators etc.) that have never given me a shot (or a penny of investment), so I feel good bringing along hundreds of regular folks and showing them that is doable without funding.  \n5) I think information wants to be free.

You HAVE to use other services and products so you'll either be taking a shot at the dark for web hosting, supplies, SEO, marketing etc or you'll take other peoples' recommendations into account. If an anonymous entrepreneur came in and gave the same recommendations, they'd be just as valid as this guy's. He tells you he owns it - he tells you he recommends it - because he believes in it. This isn't snake oil and hair tonic; you have every opportunity to do your own research and validate. Are you offended that he recommended Stripe.com instead of PayPal or Square?

This is key information!\n\n&gt; I don't have those numbers specifically but the industry shakes out in that 20-30% range from everything I've seen.\n\nFair enough, but that is information anyone could find doing background research on the industry itself. IMHO, when you are promoting specific businesses as successes based on their revenues, it is incumbent on you to either know the details of the margins for those businesses or to include a disclaimer that the margins are unknown. \n\nYou're a successful businessman. You know margins are a big, big deal - especially to startups and businesses in their early years. Most of the entrepreneurs you are advertising to (and attempting to guide) **do not** understand this. If you going to take on the role of being their guide, as you have here, it is incumbent on you to at least bring this up, and preferably emphasize it. (Again, IMHO.)\n\n&gt; We have had 1200 folks sign u for launch27, if we use that for a metric for how many people failed vs how many we have now 600, I'd say that we have a 50% failure rate. That's obviously not a clean way to estimate it but that's the best data I have.\n\nThanks. You're right, it's a crude estimate, but it is valuable. \n\nI don't know enough of the specifics of the cleaning industry to know if this is better or worse than average, but it's quite possibly better. It's certainly better than the broader picture of small businesses of all types, which overwhelmingly fail.\n\nEither way, anyone considering joining you needs to know this information going in. Again, it's arguably a selling point for you. If the normal fail-rate for e.g. home cleaning services if 75% and your signups are failing at 50%, that's worth bragging about.\n\nThanks again for your transparency.",

Happy New Year. :)\n\nTo give a quick snapshot to /u/seands - EDDM (Every Door Direct Mail) does work for both introductory offers and promotional boosts, you just have to be more specific on the targets and your initial margins. Like any marketing channel, \"your mileage may vary.\" For service-based businesses, it can be really powerful. \n\nLemme just toss out some guard rails for EDDM. \n\n* You can expect a response rate of about 1-2.5% on any reasonable introductory offer that's structured well. Many people set unrealistic expectations about that percentage, but you can pretty much set a watch to how consistent that acquisition of new clients becomes. That translates out to 1-3 people **paying you** for every 100 pieces you mail out. Work out your initial client acquisition costs well in advance and take ***reasonable*** risks and have a plan for risk abatement... Every good entrepreneur does just that. **;-)**\n* With EDDM you can get **reeeeeally** specific about your neighborhood - like, *really granular.* This improves your chances significantly. Avg median income of 85-100K for that section of town? High % rate of home ownership? More school-age kids in that neighborhood? You can just mail those neighborhoods that hit your ideal client profile and improve your response rate dramatically. \n* Economies of scale and lower cost of entry do a LOT for you with EDDM, especially if you work with a good, reputable, *local* printer. I've seen costs cut in half by just going to someone local and picking up the flats on your own. I've personally gotten the cost-per-piece down to .25 cents with postage just by talking to someone local and direct, picking up the pieces, and dropping them off a block away at the post office myself. (*That was on ~1000 full color pieces on a test print and mailing - USPS sets a flat rate of $0.176 per piece*)  \n* Speaking of pieces (and the USPS) I've NEVER had a bad experience with either the good folks at the post office or the mailers OR printers who know their stuff. Also, these things are (comparatively) HUGE... Like 11x17 in. YUUUUGE. You have a lot of real estate to work with on most pieces, convey good marketing signals and information, and improve your response rate and chances. Keep it simple and clean, make the offer clear and bold, and simple for your prospects to say yes. If you already have a clean, clear, well designed website for your business than most of the design battle is already done, which makes for a really good callback to your site (and your site's call-to-action). \n\nIn short, they work, but only if your initial margin supports it. Once you dial it in, however, it's client acquisition on auto-pilot. It's like mailing people a billboard. Sure, a BUNCH of people are going to throw it in the round file, but you only need a few people per mailing to cover the nut. Like anything else in business, do your due diligence, test stuff, and remember to *aim small, miss small.*\n\n**&gt;&gt;NOT AN AFFILIATE LINK&lt;&lt;**\n\n - https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm\n\nAll the information you need is right there in the USPS site. From there, just find a good local printer, either have a good designer or have a good sense of marketing and advertising, and just *ship it.* \n\nGood Luck and Good Hunting. ;-)",

Whatevs. \n\nEDDM is only scary because we over-complicate it, or worse, think direct mail is dead. It's weird; we have no compunction about spending hundreds or even thousands every month on SEO and PPC, but hate junk mail...\n\n***... Except it's just like a paper version of PPC.*** \n\nIf you can predict your analog versions of CTR and Conversions, and it falls in the same budget, why not do **both**?

How much would Race/Ethnicity matter? \n\nAnyway, love the post and it has me excited to start a local business unlike most other posts I have read.

We bring Uber/Lyft type technology and convenience: online booking, credit card payments, account creation, mobile app that shows teams on the way so the customer can know, and a ton of other things that 99% of other companies do not have available for customers.\n\nSo you have to appraise the competition by the quality of that competition. Most of the companies in existence are so old-school that the gap between them and us is even larger than the gap between taxis and Uber.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, so while most people are panicking about the effects of the Corona virus, I'm in a position to take full advantage of it.\n\nI'm based in Boston working in education technology, specifically the cultural heritage sector called GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).  The industry has basically been ignored as far as emerging technology goes, and I wanted to find a way to make historical research in archives more efficient.  Only about 5% of historical documents are available online, mostly due to financial limitations but also copyright restrictions (remember how Google Books failed?).  As a result, most historians are required to travel for 1-2 weeks to whatever archive holds the most primary sources they want to reference.  Researching the French revolution? Pack your bags, you're flying to France.  That's just how research is done.\n\nMy startup, ArcLive, is a video conferencing tool where you can hire a surrogate to go into the archive for you and provide live access to the documents that aren't online, like Doctor on Demand but for archives.  As an accessibility tool, we circumnavigate copyright restrictions under fair use, and the solution costs half as much as physical travel (no more flights or hotels).  The problem was that although the researchers liked it, most of the historians and archives didn't really care, or wanted to create full legal partnerships before running pilots, but we're still in Alpha and officially a B2C company.  All we need is email introductions and recommendations, the archives pay nothing and don't really need to do anything else.  We can't afford to do a legal partner with every single archive, there are thousands of them and it would take 6-8 months per archive.  Without the archives giving us direct introductions to scholars, our customer aquisition is just too expensive. So, with no easy solution, I actually shut down the business model 3 months ago.\n\nEnter the Corona virus and yesterday's Europe Travel Ban.  All of a sudden two entire continents have been closed off to each other, and it's only going to get worse.  Today I'm visiting the MIT and Harvard archives in person to discuss emergency pilots of my software for their scholars.\n\nI'll update this post at the end of the day on progress, and answer any questions you might have. Wish me luck!\n\nUpdate 3/12 - Busy day but no immediate big wins because most archives are closing to the public starting Monday.  I'm working to set up a meeting with the MIT Director of Collections next week.  Harvard is more difficult because there is no \"Harvard Library\", it's a collection of libraries managed by each separate school (business, arts etc).  The support has been overwhelming, thank you all so much!\n\nAlso\nJeffery Epstein didn't kill himself.",

And even then it was kind of worthless for a long while. \n\nI\u2019d argue it wasn\u2019t until Intels core2 architecture and the release of the iPhone that we had the necessary minimums to take something that was kind of a niche product. And start digitizing our lives in a way that meets minimum requirements and performance. Hell even the iPhone and smart phone took a long while to really be deployed. We didn\u2019t even use to have iPhone apps!\n\nRemote work is one of those things that is still VERY early in being digitized. Working from home used to be a fringe benefit. A novelty exercised rarely. Maybe once a week if you\u2019re lucky. \n\nBut I think that\u2019s changing. I used to laugh at the idea that work would drastically change. That more and more people would work remotely either for a company or doing research like this. But here we are. \n\nI think the current pandemic will be a fire drill of sorts for many companies to open up to the idea of digitizing work like this. And you\u2019re right. Your area has yet to really take off. \n\nBut I really think it\u2019s about to. Just the idea and cost associated with making someone travel so far. It\u2019s a cost savings that\u2019s obvious and one of those things I think people will kick themselves for not realizing earlier. Not only that but our society seems to drastically change something every single year. The pace of innovation accelerates. \n\nGood job and good luck!",

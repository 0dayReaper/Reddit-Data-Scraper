    "postText": "I own and manage 7 self storage facilities in upstate NY and PA. We pride ourselves on the best customer service around. Always smiling. Always very respectful. We go out of our way to make things right when we mess up. We also fight hard for rentals and new customers because we need them too survive.\n\nBut **a lot of customers are super entitled and down right mean**. It sounds silly but some use controlling and emotionally abusive tactics to get refunds, take advantage or get their way. \n\nWe had a customer who fell behind on rent. When we reached out she was upset about the lack of a rope hanging down from her unit door. Claimed she couldn't use it properly. Claimed we were discriminating against her for this reason or that reason. She continued to harass our customer service rep with a lot of offensive language and threats on the phone. I had our maintenance guy stop by and install a rope (this was her first complaint on the matter) and then I called her personally.\n\nShe insulted me. She spoke to me like I was 5 years old. She used a lot of profanity. She threatened online reviews. She threatened lawsuites. It was a wild conversation.\n\nAt the end of her lecture she demanded 2 free months of storage and a reduced rate moving forward. If we didn't comply she would sue us.\n\nSo I told her the address of my attorney and asked her to send a formal letter to him with any grievances and told her she has 30 days to get her stuff off my property. I thanked her for her time and for giving us a shot but made it clear we were not willing to do business with her anymore.\n\nIf you relate to experiences like this hang out with us over in r/sweatystartup",

The customer isn't always right IMO and if they're swearing, I cut people off right there and let them know they can come back and continue the conversation when they can be professional and civil, and we'll see what we can work out then.\n\nBut I really love what you did. People are feeling too privileged these days that they cry and fuss and threaten to get free stuff. It's so obvious.",

Some mild delusion and/or various neuroses that compel the person to behave like that way; this thread exist because it is abnormal behavior.\n\nHere's the thing: like any other mental illness, the individual suffering is not at fault in any way for having it. That doesn't mean that they can avoid bein held responsible for their actions stemming from said illness. I don't use the term \"mental illness\" as some sort of demerit or insult, and I think we would be in a way better place if the norm wasn't having negative connotations with mental illness. I'd wager no one willingly takes on a mental illness (is this even possible? I'd love to know...I think)\n\nNot placing blame doesn't absolve the person from being treated like they deserve\u2013sternly, in this case\u2013but I find that when I encounter someone *this* irrational, it helps me keep my cool and think my response through because I know they're compelled to behave this way and won't have the opportunity to stop unless they're dealt with appropriately.\n\nI didn't intend to nerd out on this response, and I totally agree btw: fuck entitled-frantic-tantrum-throwing-toddler-people.

They force their entire family to suffer through their delusions and live a life of fantastical ideas that always end in debt and bankruptcy. To this day, I am the only one who has realized the depth of their insanity, and chose my life over their \"love\" (possessive, obsessive, conditional). \n\nI pray every day someone will put them in their place, they've been ruining the lives of some of their victims for over 20 years. I have a plan to create a video explaining how I've unraveled their crazy plots and figured out their motives and addictions. This will come with an ultimatum to get help. If they choose not to pursue life-long treatment, as soon as I am financially able, I will fight them in courts/legal systems to free the rest of my family from their clutches. They have everyone on antidepressants and anti anxiety medication in the family, except their own sick selves.\n \nThe video format allows me to say what I need to without their home advantage (yelling and screaming and manipulating my family to attack me as well by playing a victim). The rest of the family will get their own videos too, in an attempt to illuminate them on their own abuse. Hopefully if they can unwash their brains, we might together stand a fighting chance of once again being a healthy family. I'm just waiting for the right moment as the situation is sensitive to those affected.\n\nThe ultimatum of getting treatment will give them the choice to continue being crazy or try and get better, a choice we know isn't usually a choice for the mentally ill. I think once you're aware of the harm you're causing, then you are fully responsible.\n\nI was just thinking that your use of the word mental illness adds to the \"taboo\" of the topic, and ultimately makes it even harder to shift our mindsets about getting help for those with depression or a substance use disorder. I dont think it was wrong to use now though. It's TRUE dammit\n\nTl;DR: I want to create a video recording of myself putting a crazy family member in their place. Video allows me to say what I need to without a shouting match.\n\nI believe you are responsible for your mental illness if you are aware of the harm you're causing.",

We were really focused on b2b but we'd get the odd walk in and if we weren't too busy we'd try and help.\nLate One Friday afternoon a woman comes in and asks us to print *one* place card for a wedding reception. My designer quite rightly said we have a setup charge for artwork and before he'd could even get to end of the sentence she starts haranguing him. I hear the kerfuffle from the back and come and see what's happening by which point she's losing the plot. I take over and confirm that there is normally a minimum artwork charge and she kicks it up a notch and accuses me of gouging  and ripping people off. I point out that laying out a card if you want it done right is not a one minute job.\n\nTruth be told - we'd have bent over backwards to help her and not even charged her if she'd just come in and asked for help rather than bitching to me because another print shop had made a mistake and then abused my staff and then me. Tempting though it was to tell her to FRO to her printer, I just said we are unable to help and please leave my premises.",

And plurally it is read and commonly stated as: Our customers are always right.\n\nSo based on that, the logical explanation is: Even though we believe our customers are always right, there are times when we provide them additional value by educating them whenever they're wrong or misguided.\n\nP.S I worked for quite a while in customer success and even took the task of training new hires. What this reddit author did is commendable and it not only saved his brand from additional, possible risks by terminating that customer's service, but he/she also boosted staff morale by preventing them from being exposed to even more toxicity (which ultimately contributes to higher productivity).",

I get so many deals done as I merely hook the fish then reel to the side of the boat and then they do 99% of the critical operational and administrative work post-sale. This only works with coachable hires and if I delegate authority. If I am gutting, cutting and cooking then who is catching the next fish? No one.

In reference to my comment specifically you\u2019re saying that if a customer came to you in a volume based setting with a complaint about your employee who you trust and has been with your business for a respectable amount of time, you would drag that employee through the mud just to keep the customer? \n\n\nBad customers might bring a good amount of business and revenue but good employees can multiply your bottom line several times over. Also admitting that it makes you feel bad to do whatever it is you\u2019re claiming to do but \u201cat least I make money\u201d is a fucked up line of thinking. There is other ways I can put food on my table. I\u2019d rather be able to sleep at night working for someone else and making less money that be a tyrannical boss that\u2019s shitty to the people he has to see everyday.",

Why do you keep bringing that up? \n\nLastly, don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that last comment.\n\u201cb-but the-nord-jord, if you treat your employees like people instead of interchangeable cogs in your money making machine you must be a commie bastard.\u201d Fuck this \u201clove it or leave it\u201d mentality. Just because the system is \u201cworking\u201d (probably only for you) doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be improved.

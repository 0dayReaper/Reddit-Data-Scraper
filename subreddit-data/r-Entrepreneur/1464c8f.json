    "postText": "Hey there! A few days ago, I (17M) posted in this subreddit asking whether it\u2019d be a good idea for me as a 17-year-old to start my own design (studio?) where I can help small to medium sized business with branding, SEO, website re-design/development and basically build a strong online presence for them; for a low(er) cost and (almost) the same quality as any other higher end companies would charge them.\n\nSo I was wondering if there are any folks out there who have already done this, or something similar, and are doing well. \n\nI\u2019m taking a gap year and I plan on making as much as money as possible to self-fund my uni expenses and tuition, so I would appreciate some advice and tips on how to get clients, how to come up with a process to lock deals in, etc.",

And the next question is how to shove many more clients through the pipeline as fast as possible since that isn't a viable option. \n\nIt is a plan to make as little money as possible by replacing thought with price. Why not take the next obvious step -- *you pay them*. You are not competing with high end web design with this idea; you compete with zero price templates.",

            "comment": "learning how to get clients is 90% of the job - for any freelance or service company. Why you? What can you provide that someone else can't? (probably nothing)\n\nThe proven method to find business is relationships. At 17 that's tough but not impossible. You have to learn how to both ask and listen for opportunities through networking. In the states there are local networking groups that meet regularly with the goal of helping each other find business or meet people that might need your business. Sometimes those meetings turn into a job, sometimes it turns into a job in a year (or never) \n\nThese seeds you plant and the relationships you develop will be the business until the work is  proof for strangers to seek you out. \n\nIt's the same for me and every small business. It's not easy. I often find it cringey when I ask or promote myself, yet when I refer a lawyer I know or a plumber I know I think nothing of it. \n\nGood luck",

            "comment": "Freelance is something you do once you have experience. You don't start out as a freelance consultant. The reason is that people are paying you for expert level work to be done correctly and independently. As a 17 year old you just don't have experience or the knowledge base.\n\nI've been mentoring someone for the last 6 months and she is no where near being able to operate independently. She hasn't even gotten her first client yet. She's been working very hard and making steady progress but there's just so much to learn. \n\nEach one of the practice areas you listed is a whole profession that will require months or years to learn to do at a level where you aren't doing damage to the businesses you're supposed to be helping.\n\nDefinitely don't compete on price, as anonjian said. That seriously just creates a race to the bottom where no service provider can make a living. Plumbers, electricians, auto mechanics all charge well for their professional services and expertise. \n\n(Side note: anonjian is gruff but provides excellent advice)\n\nIf these fields are really something you want to do, then after you've studied them thoroughly, try doing them for some non-profit organizations. Measure results. Evaluate how the projects went. How messy did they get? At what point did you lose control of the scope of work? Why did the client stop responding? What mistakes did you make? Get feedback from professionals, or from members of a Facebook group.",

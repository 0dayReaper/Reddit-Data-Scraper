    "postText": "I'm new to the entrepreneurship scene and ready to start my business. I'm targeting the elderly (60+) and thought the most effective way to get my first customers is by cold calling. Before I do this, I want to make sure I'm not doing anything unethical.\r  \n\r  \nWithout delving too much, my business idea is to interview the elderly for their life stories. I'm thinking about buying a call list. My questions are:\r  \n\r  \n1) Typically how are these lists compiled and is it done ethically?\n\n\r  \n2) Is it ethical if I am transparent about my intentions and my business?\n\nOne of the main reasons I chose this idea is because I think it would help people so I 100% want to avoid anything that is unethical.  Any feedback would be appreciated!",

At every stop I spoke with I met the most interesting people ever.  And I worked in Manhattan for 26 years so I know.\n\nMet a guy who travelled the world welding nuclear plant equipment.  He worked at the melting plant in PA!   Told crazy stories. Another guy I met was in the navy and was one of those guys that would pump middle rounds and \u201cduck\u201d as they exploded. Needless to say he was deaf.  I met Two navy Seabees (crazy bastards) teo women that were in the army way back when women serving was not a thing.  \n\nSo long story short, I move to a military town (I am not military) and by military town I mean a town right up against a marine base.  And the retired guys around here have the absolute best stories ever. I met a guy who built 100\u2019s of homes and tells stories of military happenings that would blow your mind.  Met people that helped build this nation (USA) as we know it. \n\nSo I was thinking, like a podcast. But I\u2019m just not that type.  I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re doing this because these people have such great stories to tell. Just things that you never get to hear about.   If I had to make a suggestion, I would target a whole retirement community, and just let the coordinator know what you\u2019re doing. I bet they\u2019d want to share stories with you and you could get a bunch in one shot.  Over the phone? I don\u2019t know.  People are weary now more of the AI threats and if you might be recording them.  \n\nGood luck!",

I've done a few interviews so far including my grandparents and heard all kinds of crazy stories. I'm really glad I did it because my grandpa passed away about a month after. I'm definitely leaning toward targeting retirement communities now. I'm also hoping to make podcast episodes later on.",

Here in the UK you'd be breaking the Law as you can't call anyone who hasn't given \\*YOU\\* permission to call them.  \n\n\nEmphasis on the YOU because that means you can't call a general list of people. Permission to be called by anyone isn't a thing.  \n\n\nI'd still use telephone , but following up on responses to online adverts or something and not touch bought lists with a walking stick.",

It is a group higher in risk of exploitation. There are lots of so called legit businesses that are scams. They have farms of cold callets. I have had many on the phone and can tell them apart right away.\n\nIf your product is so well attuned to this group then the best way should be good clear fine prints, adhering to best consumer standards. Selling such a product make you stand out.",

BUT if ur choosing 60+ because they may not be as savvy and ur relying on them not knowing better...Well that's unethical (and illegal in many parts of the world).\n\nSharing stories is a great idea, though. Not the easiest one, however, as u need to collect rights to share from more than just the individual. Often u need it from the family members, important people in the story, etc. Take a look at those true crime shows. Ever wondered why they can take so long to come out? Gathering rights from all the relevant people (and likely a myriad of other barriers, but a friend does this and gathering rights has blocked many, many stories).\n\nEdit- people have a right to privacy. Public figures aren't the issue, it's the not so public figures who may prefer to not have their lives shared. Just cause Mrs A tells the story doesn't mean Mr B is happy to be included in it.",

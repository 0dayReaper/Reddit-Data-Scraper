    "postText": "\"So, unlike sole traders and partnerships, the owners of limited companies are generally not personally liable for the debts of the organisation.\"\n\nSo let's say that I own and run my own business which is a private limited company.\n\nIf my business gets into debt, and I as the owner am not legally obliged to pay the debts (even with money that I've paid myself for the role of \"company director\", even though that salary has been taken from the money made by the business!), who DOES pay the debts?\n\nI know the answer is \"the company itself\", but I'm talking about if the business itself doesn't have enough money to pay its debts off. Does my business just get either taken over/bought out by someone else who CAN clear those debts, or if that isn't an option, do I, in this hypothetical situation, wind my business up?\n\nEDIT: Not sure it makes any difference to anything, but I'm based in Britain.",

If you continue taking money from the business whilst in debt you can be personally liable. Directors have legal responsibilities and this would come under trading whilst insolvent.\n\nEdit: selling is an also option if someone wants to buy it. Then it's their responsibility.",

It doesn't have to be in the fine print. You'll sign an entirely separate agreement or initial a very explicit rider to get that money. Or you won't get it.\n\nThe LLC protections that folks talk about, in the real world for small closely held firms, are really only for civil court cases not related to debt owed to a secured creditor. Whoops we killed someone thank God I can maintain the veil. Whoops I didnt do corporate governance right, Walmart greeter at 85 here I come.",

Or is it negligible in which the customer who decide to leave or stop using your product are customers you'd lose anyways hence pricing your product on one currency isn't really a big deal?",

It\u2019s super easy and usually just involves upgrading your e-commerce platform to allow for multiple currencies. But In order to take those currencies you have to have a bank in the country of that currency. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not really worth it if you have to ask the question.\n\n You do business in America. Your currency is dollars. People who shop internationally can and will use credit cards which will handle the exchange for them. You aren\u2019t really going to be losing anyone by not offering the product in their currency.",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all!\n\nI\u2019m thinking about leaving my job and would like to work on something of my own. I\u2019ve tried founding a company once before about 10 years ago but I made a TON of mistakes in my youth and na\u00efvet\u00e9. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve managed to build a healthy career in tech overseeing some really large things and have had over 40 people reporting to me. Glad to say I learned a lot from my failure and from my experience. Strategy tends to be a strength of mine, my bigger problem usually is just getting the first steps going, I love to tinker and change things, but am worse as bringing things to their base to start building from there.\n\nRecently someone brought up acquisition entrepreneurship as an option and it piqued my interest. \n\nI waiver between thinking it\u2019s a great idea and that it\u2019s just a part of this hustle economy that isn\u2019t real. For example, while I\u2019d only be interested in businesses that were not \u201cpassive\u201d (ie they need work to grow and scale, etc.), I\u2019m wondering why someone would want to sell a business that is generating profit / cash. \n\nI can think of a couple examples - illness, etc., but not so many that there would be such a huge number of businesses available to buy. Meaning, finding a good business to buy will be extremely difficult just due to competition, etc.\n\nI\u2019m also cognizant of a high number of scams on sites such as Flippa, etc. It goes without saying that due diligence will be a competency I will have to grow (I have a quant background so less worried about that). \n\nI\u2019d love to hear thoughts from this community. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Hey! Interesting post you've submitted. Here are my 2 cents (I'm an Israeli investment banker, so it's mostly from my perspective):\n\n\\- When buying an existing business, don't go to Flippa etc, as most \"businesses\" (they're often really just glorified marketing assets that you are buying) listed on there are built with the sole purpose of selling them later on (hence the huge supply of \"business\" for sale). In other words: A big part of the listings on there consists merely of a website and/or eCommerce account creating the perception of being a fully functional operating business.\n\n\\- Hence you have had experience as an employee managing a team of up to 40 persons, any of those lifestyle businesses that are on offer on online platforms will probably not suit you / gratify you in the long run. To find an existing business that's for sale, go and look around in your network for any business that you find interesting and fulfilling and ask these respective business owners whether they are up for an acquisition in the future. You'd be surprised how many business owners are actually looking for someone to buy and successfully continue the business they built. Often, this kind of deal involves you working for the business at first, and when both sides agree that it is a good fit, you can work into acquiring a majority of the shares.\n\nOn top, retaining a local business broker focused on small and medium sized companies might help you.\n\n\\- Regarding due diligence: This goes a lot deeper than just understanding numbers (which is what a quant does). Its main purpose is to find risk, specifically disproportional risks or any form of liability that has not been disclosed by the owner of the business. That's a whole different ball game than just understanding a balance sheet and P&amp;L statement. Proper due diligence goes into current obligations and contracts, environmental permits, business permits, potentially ongoing legal problems, quality control processes, client revenue verification, etc.\n\n\\- The reasons for a business owner to sell his company are quite diverse: wanting something different in life (e.g. traveling, family life, charity), exploring different entrepreneurial venues, knowing they are not the right person to grow their business to a next stage, to name a few.",

(software) .\n\nYes I could spend the time marketing it and growing it, but as a dev I make more money just building things. The opportunity cost is too high.\n\nThere are hidden sides to everything. For me, my priority is on what I want to be chasing, that's being in code all day solving problems and building. I spent the last 20 years on the biz side in C suite roles, now I just want to develop while chain smoking joints at my desk and playing golf. That is my happiness.",

            "comment": "Hello! I'm glad you're considering acquisition entrepreneurship. \n\nConsider these:\n\n  \nMarket Opportunity: Owners may sell their firms for a variety of reasons. Retirement, new endeavors, and lifestyle changes are examples. Economic conditions, business developments, and personal situations may also provide opportunities. Research and networking can help you find businesses that fit your needs.\n\n  \nAs you indicated, due diligence is essential when assessing organizations for acquisition. Financial records, market conditions, development prospects, and firm health must be assessed. This process is best handled by accountants, lawyers, and industry experts.\n\n  \nNetworking: A strong industry or community network might help you uncover acquisition prospects. Attend industry events, join relevant organisations, and meet professionals who may know of enterprises for sale. Acquisition entrepreneurial mentors and advisers can be found through networking.\n\n  \nValuation and Negotiation: Business valuation and negotiation strategies are crucial. Prepare to value a business based on its financial performance, growth potential, market conditions, and other considerations. Successful acquisition negotiations include price, finance, and contingencies.\n\n  \nContinuous Learning and Adaptation: Industry trends, market dynamics, and emerging prospects change frequently in entrepreneurship. Being adaptive and open to learning from successes and errors will help you manage business issues.\n\n  \nRemember that beginning a business, whether by acquisition or otherwise, needs careful planning, dedication, and measured risks. Success is more likely if you have a supportive network, consult experts, and strive for improvement. Good luck in business!  \nRequest testimonials: Encourage happy customers to recommend you and submit reviews. Online and word-of-mouth reviews can boost your business. Referral discounts and loyalty schemes can encourage customers to recommend your great service.\n\n  \nYou can balance and profit by attracting higher-paying clients, offering competitive pricing, and giving excellent service. Based on client input, market demand, and industry changes, adjust your plan.",

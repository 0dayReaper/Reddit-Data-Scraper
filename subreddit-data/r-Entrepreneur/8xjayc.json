I knew a set normally sells for around 3-6k here and I got in touch with a solar business to do marketing for them. \n\nMy price is always ROI based so I asked how much a normal set costs for people, they told me it was between 10-30k. \n\nMy eyes lit up and I had had to change 2 numbers in my Excel sheet for the numbers to shoot up from 3k a month to 20k a month.\n\nBut then I was told that it was just the price for the customer and in the end the business only makes 500 per sale.\n\nEventually I had set the price at 1,7k a month but I didn't get the client. :(",

You can run about 6 to 8 jobs per month with 3 experienced members, outsourcing all electrical work and using material distributors.

Those types of things are going to happen it's just a matter of time. If you have a high margin then you can sink the cost of those things if you have a low margin and high ticket items then a single bad payer can lose you all that profit for months. For example in this example if something went wrong I could be 10k down which would take 20 months to get back into the black and that's assuming no other problems arise.\n\nThe liability to your suppliers is your liability you are taking on a huge risk selling at that low volume with such low margins.\n\nMy Dad had a \u00a31 million a year business selling carpets years and years back. The problem with them is that people would only pay fully once the carpet was fitted and then if the cheque bounced how did you get the carpet back as it was cut and fitted into their home. On smaller ticket items say at $5 if you have lower margins is easier to swallow the cost of a few bad eggs but you still need that margin.\n\nSome people on here have tiny margins on very high risk products / services and are gloating about how successful they are. They don't realise that you're never that far away in business from complete and utter failure.",

That's not the point though the point is liability isn't taken into account in the comment above mine. Even with dropshipping as the end seller you take liability so often you'll need to absorb shrinkage it's just a fact of retail so you really need that margin. In the counter top business I'm sure the margins are higher that 500 out of 10k gross. I'd say at that margin it's just not worth the risk for an individual.",

The difference points out a bunch of issues about asking for \"profit\" numbers. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think claiming you \"make\" $xxxk when you are selling close to or under cost is as deceptive as hell but gross profit isn't necessarily reliable either. I have made 60-80% margin on manufactured products selling for 10-25k each BUT each took so much of my time, sales effort and ongoing support that I'm still not sure they were economically wise. If we are talking Net Profit should we consider not only those costs but goodwill, depreciation, previous years marketing expense, inventories and returns, our own often unpaid time? You absolutely can draw a line and get a number but you need to understand the business to understand what the number actually means.\n\nI think Net Profit is easy for any entrepreneur to understand because they are thinking about how it works with their own business. Asking people to post it about other businesses kind of asks them to make up a number or post something without enough context to understand it.",

Like, I'm getting some vibes from this post and comments that say that invitations to/promotions of your own business in a post or comment is a no-no (subject to downvotes maybe?), but if you're sharing your experience it's okay?\n\nAlso, if I created another account for a business feed and to ask questions, comment, and give updates on things I do in business, and my username is the business I plan to most use (if it's connected to a personal brand, because I see it as an extension of me), would that be seen as taboo? Would it be better if I use the business name or a regular forum-like name, or does it matter?",

I've personally grown intolerant of advertising, I have an advert-free experience daily (at home at least), I don't watch TV at all because of it, and block everything on my browsers. This does create an odd feeling now that I need to start advertising/marketing lol, but I try to do it in a way that'd be as compatible as possible with me as an individual. Anyway, I personally think that a reddit username for the purpose of a business perhaps should have the business name on it for transparency, at least that's what I'm thinking of doing.

Hopefully you will find some useful information and ask some good questions of your fellow entrepreneurs.\n\nAs for self promotion, your observations are correct about how sensitive many are to it. That is in part why it is against the rules. Entrepreneurs seem to be targeted more than most, likely because we spend money to make our plans happen and no one can know for sure what will work. That begs for liars to step in to take advantage and even honest people often can't understand that what they offer just won't work with a completely new business. \n\nEvery marketing contact or useless bit of chatter also wastes a bit of every entrepreneur's greatest resource - their time. If I read a fiction post I can read one less learning post or I steal time from my customers. That weakens my business.\n\nI think these things make experienced entrepreneurs, the ones who have maintained focus enough to actually build a business, either tend to hate self promotion or completely ignore it (or make a business of it I suppose).\n\nThe guidelines here are this: no posts designed for self promotion, every post must contain enough content for a discussion on site and report anything that doesn't follow the rules on the sidebar. Violations will NOT be prosecuted - mods will consider the report, possibly contact the user and explain the issue, remove content that obviously breaks the rules and ban only after egregious or repeated offenses.",

Tends to burn off layer upon layer of wantrepreneur dreaming. \n\nToo many people jump into business like it is being run by the capitalism fairy. Leave your bliss under your pillow. Dream your entrepreneurial dream. In the morning you'll have a bright shiny quarter. \n\nA while back somebody posted a text wall analysis of Pinterest's rather rapid success. Two important things were tellingly removed from this analysis. A fuckton of venture capital. And the app which got founders funding was not Pinterest -- it was a discontinued app called Tote with lackluster market response. \n\nJust from minutes of research, you could tell ALL of Pinterest's success was due to learning gained from Tote, even when the bulk of the functionality was ignored by users. \n\nThe author of the analysis had clearly put thought and research into the post. Omissions were not due to ignorance. They were done to cater to the wantrepreneral myth. You don't need money. You just 'do shit.' Never end a product, that's quitting. \n\nSo what happened? The guy knew his audience. And gave them what they wanted. These people post because you upvote of course. You upvote because you can't do anything else. \n\nYou want a tl;dr because reading is such a chore? Naivet\u00e9 is not a skill. Stop practicing. ",

I don't think its a bad idea. I also don't do anything fixed rate yet but I'm working towards it.\n\nThe one thing I do do but used to do more of is lower my rates for interesting projects or people. If I thought it was going to be really enjoyable I might give a discount. I don't recommend that all that much though.

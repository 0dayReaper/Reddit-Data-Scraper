    "postText": "Basically I'm 27 and live at home with my mom. I help out with bills and my monthly expenses come up to about $700 a month.\n\nI graduated from college and I was so determined to get a full time job bcuz that's what I was \"supposed to do\". I now work 40hrs a week in and office making $45k a year. With commute and everything I'm dedicating about 60hrs a week to this job. I'm literally exhausted and in a bad mood all the time. Oh ana I don't have dental insurance but I desperately need dental work that I can't afford out of pocket. \n\nAnyway, basically with what I'm currently making at my job I still can't afford to move out on my own. And getting a roommate defeats to purpose of leaving my mom's place. And the way things are going this job won't get me to the life style I want. It feels more like I'm just doing them a favor \n\nI want to start making content on YouTube and TikTok, I'm fairly certain with consistency I could make some sort of income. I see ppl all the time saying that quitting and starting online was a great decision. I don't have the energy to film things or even come up with content after working all day, I just dont. I'm not built that way, ik some ppl can do all that after work but I'm not some people, I'm me. \n\nSo bcuz I don't have crazy monthly expenses, I was thinking it might be best for me to get a part time job while working on streaming/content. But I'm a bit afraid to quit this full time job and idk why, especially knowing it won't give me what I need. \n\nOpinions?",

It may look easy to be a content creator, but try doing it and you\u2019ll see why everyone isn\u2019t doing it. If you\u2019re finding reasons not to do it, you have to be honest with yourself whether you really want it or not. If the answer is yes you do, just getting on and doing it is the only way",

Also I can't make content working full time cuz I'm exhausted all the time. Ik some ppl can make both work, but were all different and I don't have to do things they same way some one else does. \n\nI want financial freedom and I just know working this full time job won't get me there \n\nAlot of u are saying I shouldn't start YT bcuz its not guaranteed, however even at my \"stable\" job I don't make enough to live on my own. Id probably have to quit this job in a year anyway to move with my mom again cuz like I said I can't afford my own place\n\nSo I can either waste a year of my life with a job that won't get me anywhere....or I can at least TRY something different. And if it fails I'm pretty much in the same position I started in",

I don't know much about it myself, but I would think that even getting to $700/mo to cover your minimum expenses is going to take a lot of work and a bit of luck. \n\nFor every person on YT that makes a decent amount of money, there are tons more who don't make anything at all. \n\nHow much money do you currently have saved? Can you go 6 months or more with no income? Even if you do create an income stream from YT, I think it will take some time to get there.\n\nSo, you mention getting a part time job. At $45K, you're currently making about $22-23 per hour. Can you find a part time job that pays that well? What are your options?\n\nAnd then, if you find that you don't end up making any money with YT, how hard will it be to find another job that pays at least $45K?\n\nOverall it sounds like you just don't like your current job. Could you find another one that pays better or that you enjoy more?",

            "comment": "You already got lots of good responses. Some people have stability on their life,so they can quit everything and do what they want. You may not have that flexibility. It sounds like you have not even started creating contents yet, and you want to quit your only source of income. Unless you have other reliable source of income or balances that can cover your expenses safely for at least a year, you should not quit your current job.You need to understand there are millions of content creators and very few of them can make living out of it. Also, you can not monetize your channels immediately after you start in most platforms.\n\nIf you do not have energy to create contents, then you can actually start making notes on what type of content you want to make and create story for your contents.  This way, when you feel energetic, you can just focus on creating content as your \"plot\" is ready. This can be done on the weekends, or take a day off every other week for it. See what contents generates more interaction, and focus on those and keep improving. If everything goes as expected and you can generate at least half of your current income, then you can think about dedicating all your time. At this stage, If there is a possibility, take a month leave whether it is paid or unpaid, and try if it is worth the time before you quit your job permanently.",

I basically have no bills, well now I have a $490 weekly car rental from enterprise but other than that, nothing. I bring in about $5-6k which this ba delivery job but am slaving away to push it to closer to $7k working 10am to 3am everyday. The goal was to save up $25-50k but that kinda went to shit and I\u2019m down to $11k. \n\nBut I\u2019m saving fuck it and quitting and moving to Colombia to study math, coding, build a company/app/website, and explore, and or learn enough/build a portfolio to get a better job. I have a 6 month lease on Airbnb where I pay $1800 per month. I have already paid the first month. The plan is to earn money passively by selling covered calls on the stock market on affirm. It\u2019s not going well for me tbh. But what I\u2019m getting at is that I have somewhat of a plan is what I\u2019m getting at.\n\nYou need to sit down, come up with a concrete plan with set milestones, start and end dates, and execute it. \n\nMilestone 1- save $5k. \n\nMilestone 2- find an Airbnb or rental, pay first month. Once you pick a date and pay, this starts the clock. Try to give yourself at least 3-4 months because something always pops up.\n\nMilestone 3- save $15k\n\nMilestone 4- find companies and sponsors. This is where the money made, not YouTube ads. It all depends on your niche though\n\nMilestone 5- buy all the equipment and everything you need\n\nMilestone 6- start\n\nMilestone 7- upload 50 videos within the first 2 months\n\nMilestone 8- gain 1,000 subs or 10,000 views\n\nIf you don\u2019t see traction after 4-5 months, quit, and get back to work before you run out of money or make a mistake you can\u2019t fix\n\n\nFeel free to hmu, I actually do have 2 YouTube channels I grew from 0-200k views. 1, coding, literally was getting me real life opportunities like jobs and sponsorships. I was so stupid to not have continued. But I\u2019ll be moving to and living in Medellin Colombia from late July to late January. If things don\u2019t work by January, I will come back. Not sure how much you have saved up, but we could split a condo in Colombia if your crazy enough to actually follow through. But please save up a war chest. You don\u2019t want to run out of money early. I\u2019ve been there",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I've been working on a little side project and I'd love to get your thoughts.\n\n\nI built an [AI chatbot](https://www.ideationfuture.com/) inspired by lessons from 35 of my favorite startup books and some Silicon Valley luminaries' teaching. I figured these sources have provided me with a lot of insight over the years, so why not build an AI that I can talk with, to give me the same great advices?\n\n\nHere are some of the books I've programmed it with:\n\n*\tThe Lean Startup\n*\tZero to One\n*\tHooked\n*\tTraction: Get a Grip on Your Business\n*\t\u2026\n\n\nAnd the AI also incorporates insights from leaders like:\n\n*\tMarc Andreessen\n*\tChris Sacca\n*\tJason Calacanis\n*\t..\n\n\nThe chatbot has been pretty helpful for me, especially when I've needed advice on ambiguous decisions. I thought it'd be cool to share this tool, so I've made it available for free on my website.\nI'm really interested in knowing how it works for other people. Did it provide any useful advice for you? Or maybe there are things that could be better? I'm all ears for constructive criticism. My plan is to continue to improve the chatbot, with additional knowledge sources and teachings.\n\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts. Hope you find the tool useful.",

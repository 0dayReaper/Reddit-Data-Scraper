    "postText": "Hi all, i\u2019m currently 19 and have a mobile detailing business with my friend. we have our good days where we do 3-4 cars and make roughly $400 on each car. however, the end goal is to have consistent clients coming each day even if it\u2019s just one car. does anyone have tips to do this? even if you have a power washing business or whatever it may be. i\u2019d really appreciate your help. i just got business cards in the other day, and we live in the most expensive city/town in all of north america; most of our clients will be between 40-70years old with expensive cars as well if that helps with any marketing tactics at all.\n\nThanks again!",

Then go to local businesses and ask if you can leave your fliers/cards. Create social media profiles and buy local targeting ads possibly offering some kind of promo for first time customers just to get the ball rolling. Maybe give your current customers referral discounts so you get some word of mouth going. Just some ideas.",

I'm around the corner in \\[ insert very close place \\] doing a car for a new customer tomorrow. Let me know if you'll be at work as I can fit you in for the afternoon\".  \n\n\nThis works for him - not always but it works. Automate this process and just have it purring away in the background bringing you a steady stream of jobs.",

They can refer clients to you and you can offer them a discount for every referral. Also, don't underestimate the power of social media - post before-and-after photos of your detailing work and encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on your page. Good luck with your business!",

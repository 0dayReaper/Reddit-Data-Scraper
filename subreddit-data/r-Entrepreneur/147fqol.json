    "postText": "I\u2019ve been copywriting since August of 2007. In tang time I have used sites such as Upwork and Fiverr for finding work. If people asked, I sent them my LinkedIn profile link so they could see samples of my writing. But I finally have a website now so potential clients can see samples of my writing. It\u2019s basic right now but it\u2019s live. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to my website https://caringcopy.blog. If anyone\u2019s interested in my writing services, please send me a DM or contact me through my website.",

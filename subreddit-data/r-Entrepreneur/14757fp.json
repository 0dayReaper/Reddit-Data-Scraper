    "postText": "I am pondering the questions, what type of work would be suitable for someone to acquire digital skills on the job, while working remotely.\n\nLikewise what would it make easier for an employer to give it a try without platforms as Upwork etc.\n\nI still believe that many organizations have work that is not done, because it cannot be packaged precisely in a job. Everyone wants the fast lane, but the turtle may win the race because it must focus on the long term. \n\nThat someone leaves education early doesn't necessarily say something about one's intelligence.\n\nIf you can think of examples (kind of work) please add them.\n\nFrom my experience:\n- online searches\n- data entry\n- customer service\n- social media updates\n- collecting information\n- appointment setting\n- help desk",

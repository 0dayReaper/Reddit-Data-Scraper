Even if you find your way around that, environmental impact will be your next hurdle, if you clear that you will have start-up costs that will take a long time to recover, and the asset, the bayside real estate, all of those costs to \"improve the property\" will not necessarily increase the value of the asset and may actually decrease it.",

    "postText": "Here's a great story about an entrepreneur crushing it an unglamorous, unsexy industry: **porta-potty rental.**\n\nPooping is a great equalizer. No matter who you are \u2014 you, me, the King of England, the President of the United States, and the person who does the President\u2019s dry cleaning \u2014 at some point in the last day or two, we\u2019ve all had to sit down and perform this most basic of bodily functions.\r\n\n(If you haven\u2019t, please see a doctor urgently, or at the very least, eat more fibre.)\n\nAnd when people have been doing something for thousands of years \u2014 eating out, building homes, swimming, watching plays, and yes, pooping \u2014 there\u2019s probably a profitable business in that niche.\n\nThat brings us to **Gary Mead, the poop millionaire of Chelmsford, Essex, here in the UK.**\n\nGary has built Euroloo, his porta-potty rental business, into a company with revenue of about \u00a39m and profit of \u00a31m. **Renting porta-potties.**\n\nHow has he built this business?\n\n**Origins**\n\nGary\u2019s story begins in the late 90s. At the tender age of 22, he started a small property management company in his home town of Chelmsford, Essex, about 30 miles northeast of London. According to his LinkedIn profile, he grew it every year for five years in a row, achieved profitability, and sold it. A successful exit by the age of 27 \u2014 not bad at all.\r\n\nPossibly just to prove it wasn\u2019t luck, Gary then started a small property management company in his home town of Chelmsford, Essex. He grew it every year for three years in a row, achieved profitability, and sold it. Again.\r\n\n(If you take nothing else from this post, learn this: if Gary Mead ever sells you a property management company, make sure you include a non-compete clause.)\r\n\nAs a result, at just 30 years old, Gary had two successful exits under his belt. Likely holding some capital and a well-earned degree from the University of Hard Knocks, Gary scouted around for the next chapter in his career.\r\n\nWhat next for this intrepid entrepreneur? Go for the property management three-peat? Start a SaaS business? Rest on his laurels and start a coaching business?\r\n\nNot for young Gary. No, **Gary saw his future paved with brown gold.**\r\n\nIn 2003, Gary Mead founded Euroloo. Euroloo rents porta-potties to you, for a fee, including drop-off, pick-up, and weekly servicing.\r\n\nThis is what Mike Rowe would call a Dirty Job. When these porta-potties are dropped off on site on day one, they\u2019re clean. When they\u2019re picked up again on day seven, they are not. Someone has to make them clean again before renting them to the next customer.\r\n\nThat\u2019s both a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s a curse because, you know, you have to clean up poop. For more detail on this subject, check out this article from the wonderfully named company Poles and Holes:\n\n&gt;*\u201cA good pair of gloves and a spray bottle full of cleaner is all it really takes to keep a porta-potties looking like new!\u201d*\r\n\nIt\u2019s a blessing because grads from Harvard Business School and the LSE don\u2019t want to go into this business. It\u2019s not glamorous, it\u2019s not sexy, and you probably don\u2019t get admiring looks when you talk about it at the dinner table.\r\n\nThat\u2019s great, because you don\u2019t want to be competing against HBS and LSE grads. You want to compete, as Nick Huber says, with the type of person making a lot of money and using a fax machine. You are more likely to find those people in an industry like porta-potties. And with some smart use of technology, you can out-compete them.\r\n\n**SEO works with poop too**\r\n\nEuroloo are doing a couple of things you don\u2019t usually see from companies in industries like this.\r\n\nFirstly, they\u2019re putting time and money into paid search. If you google \u201cportaloo hire \\[city\\]\u201d you\u2019ll see them come up (at least in the UK). I did this for my city, Nottingham, and Euroloo are #2 in the sponsored search results, and they\u2019re also #2 in the organic search results.\r\n\nIf I click through on mobile, I\u2019m taken to a landing page, that includes the city name, and a phone number with a local area code.\n\nBut wait! If I google \u201cportaloo hire Manchester,\u201d they\u2019re the #2 sponsored result again. If I click through, I\u2019m taken to a different landing page, that mentions a different city, with a different local phone number, which makes them look like a local Manchester business.\n\nThis is a level of tech and internet marketing that you honestly just don't see it blue collar industries like this. Definitely makes them stand out. And it's not *that* hard to do either.\r\n\n**Is there money in porta-potties?**\r\n\nShort answer: yes.\r\n\nEuroloo are based in the UK so a lot of their company financials are public info. I dove into Euroloo\u2019s financial statements to see what I could learn.\n\nThey don't publish a full P&amp;L because they're so small, but their retained earnings -- i.e. the total cumulative profit in the business -- went up by \u00a3871k in 2022.\n\nThat means that after **any dividends paid, Euroloo made \u00a3871k profit.**\n\nThe UK corporate tax rate is 19%, and \u00a3871k is the after-tax profit, meaning the pre-tax profit must be \u00a31.075m. \n\nI also estimated their revenue based on the accounts receivable. Euroloo are selling to trade customers, probably on credit terms, so those construction crews and event management teams are paying for their porta-potties after they\u2019ve used them.\r\n\nOn 31st March 2022 they had \u00a3422.8k outstanding in accounts receivable. That includes 20% VAT (UK sales tax) that they can\u2019t count as revenue, so if we strip that out, we're left with a figure of \u00a3352k.\n\nGuessing that their customers are on 14 day credit terms, then you do 352k / 14 \\* 365 \n\n= **\u00a39.2m** **annualised revenue.**\n\nLastly, just for fun, I got a quote from Euroloo to rent my own porta-pooty.\n\nThe minimum rental period is 4 weeks at \u00a3195. That works out as \u00a348.75 per week.\n\nIf their revenue is around \u00a39.2m and each toilet rents for an average of \u00a348.75 per week, we come up with a total of **188,438 toilet hire weeks per year.**\r\n\nI'm guessing each toilet is in use 90% of the time to account for time spent picking up, cleaning, and delivering. That means they need about **4000 porta-potties.**\r  \n\r  \nTheir financials say they've spent \u00a33.2m on fixed assets, which means **each toilet costs around \u00a3800 each**.\r\n\nThis also tells us that the real business here isn\u2019t buying expensive assets and renting them out. Porta-potties are about \u00a3800 each, and you can rent them for \u00a348.75 a week. **Your payback period is less than 6 months.**\n\nSo this is really a logistics and distribution business. The trick here is making sure that your 4,000 porta-potties are on site, earning income, as much as possible.\n\n**The secret sauce**\r\n\nSo our master of poop, Gary Mead, has a business with around \u00a39m in revenue, a fleet of around 4,000 portaloos, netting him at least \u00a3900k a year, while employing 93 people in the process.\n\nWhat I really love is how Gary describes the secret sauce. The engine of growth. It\u2019s word of mouth and repeat business.\r How do they drive that word of mouth? What ensures their incredible reputation?\r  \n\r  \nGary's LinkedIn page simply says:\n\n*We want our customers to recommend us to others and to use our services time after time because:*\n\n* *It\u2019s easy to work with euroloo*\r\n* *We deliver and service as promised*\r\n* *We are friendly and customer focussed*\n* *Our people are trained and good at their job*\n\n\rI love the simplicity. These principles are not rocket science.\r Euroloo is a phenomenal example of, as Charlie Munger says, \u201ctaking a simple idea, and taking it seriously.\u201d\r\n\nSo you can get rich following **the Euroloo playbook**:\n\n\r\n\n1. Pick an unglamorous industry.\r\n2. Focus on operational and customer excellence.\r\n3. Layer in some technology.\r\n4. Keep at it for 20 years.\r\n\nThat\u2019s what Gary Mead has been doing since 2003. Over that time he's built an incredible business worth millions that provides a great living for him, his family, and his team. I love to see it. Anyone could do this. It\u2019s not easy, but it is simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(if you want more detail, check out [this post](https://netincome.substack.com/p/making-a-million-pounds-from-dirty), which includes a bunch of figures and screenshots I couldn't put here)",

If you take your analysis of $800 cost per unit that was derived without any other FA, we could consider the per unit cost to be much lower. Based on your other calculations I would say most of that FA line item wouldn't include porta potties as they would be expensed immediately rather than depreciated with such a low unit cost. You have to ask yourself what is the perceived useful life of a relocatable shitter.",

I'm also curious I'd there's any regulations or even city contract or licensing limitations.  Locally, I've seen a lot of different brands.  Additionally, I've often not seen a consistent brand for a long time.  Every one I see is often a new company name I've never seen before.  I don't know why though.  For the low cost, low tech, ans quick ROI, I'm not sure what other bottlenecks exist.  Maybe it's just a lot of folks simply are not good business people and don't survive the startup and growth phase.  They may never get to a point where they can quit their day job.\n\nOne thing I will very much agree with is a good business understands it's always about the relationships.  Often the product is almost secobdary to the human side for reasons why people pick you versus anyone else.  I've seen this repeat so many times first hand.",

And disposal of said shit.\n\n&gt;The engine of growth. It\u2019s word of mouth and repeat business. How do they drive that word of mouth? \n\nThat's always nice, but if you are a start up and have no customers at all, where to you get the word-of-mouth?\n\nIf this is the case that you have to do marketing in order to get the first 500 customers before you can start getting word-of-mouth (not every customer is going to recommend you), why wouldn't one keep doing that. They probably are, but continued marketing for new clients is important. Coco-cola doesn't depend only on word-of-mouth, they spend $4 billion per year on marketing. For example.\n\n/\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a blessing because grads from Harvard Business School and the LSE don\u2019t want to go into this business. \n\nAhh....no. Top university grads, including Harvard, will get their hands dirty. They've watched Mike Rowe on Dirty Jobs, just like me and you. *Some* of them will be ok doing dirty jobs if the price is right.\n\n.\n\n\nFor example, let's look at garbage companies. All these following graduated from top USA universities:\n\nWaste Management garbage company - $20 billion annual revenue - CEO James Fish, MBA University of Chicago; COO John Morris, Rutgers University\n\nRepublic Services garbage company - $14 billion annual revenue - CEO Jon Vander Ark, JD Harvard Law School \n\nClean Harbors garbage company - $5 billion annual revenue - CEO Alan McKim, MBA Northeastern University\n\n.\n\nThe reason that the porta potty company doesn't have Harvard grads is that the industry as a whole is too small, not because it is too dirty. In the USA, the entire porta-potty toilet rental market size is $2 billion. That is very tiny. The industry is fragmented, so purchasing most of the businesses to make it grow into one large business is very low odds, as many current owners will keep their business and not sell it. If there were 10 or 15 large portapotty companies in the USA that had 80% of the market, then for sure the industry would be a target, but that's not how it is. There are 3,377 portapotty businesses in the USA, employing 15,785 people. Waste Management garbage company has 50,000 employees by itself.\n\nThis is why it is an attractive industry for entrepreneurs. As an entrepreneur, you have to find niches where the big boys don't go. Or it helps, anyways.\n\nGreat post, though, love it.",

Of course not. \n\nThere are so many moving pieces with a business like that, and so many employee hours needed for literally every single rental, that his profit is actually pretty solid. \n\n30+% profit margins in the real world are exceedingly rare for physical businesses at scale (no, Bob who has 2 employees and does landscaping doesn't count).",

My project volumes are going to be good though. So its good for me to get into this mind set.",

The rentals require winning over construction businesses and large events. You have to kick back and play a networking game. I have a friend in the business and he does very well. Perhaps more than a M/year. You also have to keep them clean. His u it\u2019s are always very clean and well maintained.",

    "postText": "So I had an idea that I want to jump on before it gets presented to the next entrepreneur. \nFor those of you that are familiar with gentle parenting, what do you think about doing a fatherhood prep/ gentle parenting course for new dads? \n\nA little background on myself, I\u2019ve been a full time stay at home dad for my twin autistic boys for 4 years now. I\u2019m soul searching, finding what I\u2019m great at and thinking of ways to make my name doing it. The one thing I\u2019m best at is being a dad. In 4 years, I\u2019ve learned a lot. And I\u2019ve taken initiative to do in depth learning to better help my boys. \n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve noticed in regards to gentle parenting, it seems to always land on the mothers shoulders. My wife is the one that introduced me to it, and taught me the ropes. I want to change that. I\u2019m hoping to create an outlined learning course on different thought processes, coping mechanisms, activities, and overall parental guidance. Once again, this is more brainstorming than anything. What kind of conflicts/ roadblocks could I potentially run into? What about profitability/ marketing strategies? I\u2019m not even sure if there\u2019s a certification in that required/ beneficial? Thanks in advance! I absolutely cherish advice given to me.",

It\u2019s shocking how little representation there is of men on parenting groups on Facebook etc. I expect there are willing customers out there and you can reach them via their wives/girlfriends who are already active in gentle parenting groups and wished their partners were more involved.",

One thing I\u2019ve come to learn about Gentle Parenting is that it\u2019s looked at as sort of \u201cfeminine\u201d and that\u2019s just not the case as you know! By no means am I trying to be \u201cthe face of Male Gentle Parenting\u201d but we absolutely need men pushing/ practicing it more. I feel like if more fathers saw the standard masculine dad showing this lifestyle, it would help the stigma around it being a \u201cmothers only\u201d type of parenting.",

Just wanted to throw it out that there are tons of Instagram accounts that focus on gentle parenting there are dad's doing the content too. Just something to maybe check and to your list as a potential marketing strategy. \nWhile others said that you will fall short of content I would say no. Because the market is always growing there will be new dad's in the making who will be your potential clients. \n\nExample sleep training for kids. We follow a sleep doctor who sells a ebook for sleep training for $75. People can think that it's a one time buy and no repeat but the pool of clients is always increasing and young parents will need the guide. \n\nSo work on a good content form course, ebook and then create short form videos with you doing gentle parenting on your kids to create a community",

            "comment": "I think there is a niche there (Parenting stuff focused on Fathers) that is possibly untapped. I'm a very involved father and there are lots of great resources for stuff like gentle parenting,  feeding, adhd stuff. But it's very clear that most of these are designed by women for women. Which is fine, you can still get the info. But they often speak exclusively to \"Mommas\" or stuff like that and it definitely feels alienating as a father who wants to engage.\n\nI've considered something similar to you, but have never taken the plunge to really dig in. \n\nThe challenge,  as I see it, is confirming that there are enough Father's out there who want to engage in this kind of learning, and if they are willing and able to engage in the form of a class and/or social media community. \n\nSpeaking of that, imo, for something like this to be a long term serious business you're going to have to build the social community around it. You'd have to get dads interacting and sharing and commenting. You need to become viewed as an authority,  so when new dads talk your brand comes up. I don't really believe making a class and selling on coursera or something would ever really lead to anything but a little side thing. \n\nYou've got to find people who will take take your course, apply the lessons,  find success,  and share about it.",

The alternative doesn\u2019t seem like something their shut down to, more like just willfully ignorant. I am an eccentric, positive, and confident person that, with time, could make the gentle parenting lifestyle something that dads would be eager to learn about. To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t be trying to build a multimillion dollar career out of this. I believe that Gentle Parenting is more just choosing a more peaceful lifestyle so if I can spread that message and help people incorporate it into their lives while making enough to just keep doing it, I\u2019m happy!",

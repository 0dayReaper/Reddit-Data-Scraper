    "postText": "In 2013 I moved to NYC with big dreams of making it somehow, someway, in something. I knew nobody, had no connections, my English was good but not great and I had never before started a company of any kind. \n\n**Company 1:** in 2014 I launched Beyond Neutral it was an organic cold pressed alkaline forming line of fresh juices (when juicing was a real trend). Our problems were: 1. Saturated market 2. Short shelf life 3. Some were high in sugar 4. Needed refrigeration 5. Pricey\n\n**Company 2:** In 2015 we pivoted to Shotco. A line of organic shots. Meant to be taken at diftimes of day like a vitamin. These shots solved many of our previous problems but they created one big one. At the time it wa only us and maybe 2 other companies, we were going to need to do a lot of consumer education. We raised a 6 figure seed round but ultimately after 2+ years we shut down the company.\n\n**Company 3:** 4 Months before Covid hit I had this idea to eliminate single use cups in coffee shops. The idea was a cup that would connect to an app, you would pre order your coffee, and  the barista could scan and make your desired cup. I raised a small pre seed of 50k, found a manufacturer in China but right then Covid hit and we hit a wall. Our biggest issue was that coffee shops would not under any circumstance accept cups from outside and China was a big issue as well. Bye Bye coffee business.\n\n**Company 4:** This was more of a little side project, Lettair was a way to write someone a lettair online and we would create and mail the actual thing on your behalf. Bad idea, bad execution, i shut it down pretty quickly.\n\n**Company 5:** 2021: Wilder a marketplace for booking outdoor guides. This was crazy,   \nI managed to get a decent amount of hype with people who wanted to join the company, people who wanted to invest and I was able to create a waitlist of a few hundred ppl before we even launched. however within a few months (as we were building) my cofounder left unexpectedly (family issues was the official story) and after that everything kinda dissolved fairly quickly with a couple of months. The momentum, the hype, the inertia, all gone.\n\n**Company 6:** 2023, I reconnected with a childhood friend who I hadn\u2019t talked to in a longtime. We had a long conversation and at the end decided to both make a list of potential idea we would like to work on. Which is how [The Woof](https://www.woofnews.co/subscribe) was born. While its still early we are both really into it, enjoying what we are dong, enjoying working together and solving problems and learning how we grow &amp; scale. So far we are happy with our progress and hope we can hit our end year goal. \n\n**Conclusion**: While I still do not have that fairytale ending (yet) I never let my failures dissuade me from trying again, learning my lessons and improving. Dont listen to all the overnight success stories you see on social media they are either lies or outliers. Most of the entrepreneurs I know and have chatted to have taken the long hard road. If you fail 3 times, you get up 4 times. Dont let the fact that it didn\u2019t go your way today, stop you from trying tomorrow, that's it.",

Sometimes, you need to cut your losses and start over.  I've launched 5 companies.  2 were sorta ok, especially for the goals I set for them.  2 were duds that never really got off the ground.  1 has completely changed my life.  If it's bad and isn't working, quit while you're ahead.",

The idea of a paid newsletter is providing unique content, or unique angles on content, or curated content that saves readers ***time***, which is inevitably what we all want more of. The business model is VOLUMETRIC MRR. Not high ticket. So, think $10 a month subscription that nobody really misses, because it costs more to buy a coffee for one day than a subscription for one month. Then multiply that by X amount, it soon compounds. Plus then you have access to a targeted audience directly. You can negotiate brand deals with relevant companies to bring your subscribers unique offers etc. there\u2019s so many caveats to producing more income. It\u2019s a very lucrative model if you can pull it off.",

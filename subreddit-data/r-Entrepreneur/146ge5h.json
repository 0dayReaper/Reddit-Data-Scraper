    "postText": "Hey guys I run an online tutoring company for elementary students. We've been experiencing massive growth avg &gt;50% increase in students per month. I started this company in the hopes of providing students with great education, despite low profit margins, but as I reach the top I realised the services I provide aren't much appreciated. That is not to say the services provided are not needed. Online tutoring is a huge market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get new students, we provide free trial lessons. Mothers have been signing their child up for free lessons and just either:\n\n1. take it as a freebie just for the sakes of it\n2. straight up ignore any confirmation requests for the trial \n\nIt doesn't get easier when mothers sign up. They have crazy requests and expectations. I am not a mother, so is this something that comes with dealing with mothers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnybody have any similar experiences feeling unappreciated for the services/product you provide to customers? Or is it just about keeping the mindset of making money?",

            "comment": "This is pretty common anytime you offer a free service/product as a lead magnet. If you find that the customers it attracts aren't offsetting the costs of the free sessions that don't result in sales, the logical move is to start charging for the first session.\n\nThat might sound obvious, but there are lots of ways to make it as appealing as a free session to your ideal customers. For example you could give 80% off the first session, which would make it extremely affordable, and find other bonuses you can provide with that first session based on what your existing customers would want.\n\nYou could also switch to a one-to-many freebie model instead of one-to-one. For example you could run regularly scheduled webinars where the mothers can sign their kids up for a free group session. You could also run regular webinars that are info sessions for the mothers and then offer them a discount if they buy within 24 hours after the webinar ends.",

I\u2019ve got pretty good estimate I think on monthly revenue and expenses. \n\nI basically have a sort of ball park on land prices in my area for what I\u2019ll need but as far as construction costs go I\u2019ve found this  nearly impossible to find since coast range significantly between companies, time of year what\u2019s being done and where.  \n\nDid any of you more experienced people run into this? How did you get past it?",

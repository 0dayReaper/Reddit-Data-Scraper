Coffee shops to me aren\u2019t the most comfortable spaces to work long hours and most libraries are good for studying but I can\u2019t take and make calls in between work/ research. Again, I need options until I can afford an office space any other ideas and recommendations ?",

It would not fit the decorum of a 4 or 5 star hotel to approach a randomer in their lobby and say \"can I help you?\". Yes, maybe if you're looking suspicious.\n\nBut, if you're there with a laptop or just generally looking busy, they won't go near you. Because you're a \"guest\" there also. (However, I'm sure it would not be that out-of-place for a member of their cafe-bar staff to approach you asking if you would like anything. In this circumstance, it would probably be rude not to order a tea, coffee or mineral at least!.",

I found that by calling office type businesses in your area and asking if they have an empty office you could rent for a $200 a month, (during office ours only) they would oblige. For me personally I had a friend prepandemic that had a large HR firm with two floors and he let me use a nice conference room on his admin floor for hours at a time (during working hours) a long as I gave him a day or two notice.",

There may be such spaces in LA as well where you can apply and probably get approved.\n\nWe also have a Google Campus for Startups where you can work for free, but you have to apply first as well.\n\nAgain there might be something similar in LA, organized by some Tech Company.\n\nIf you're working on something innovative you can apply for an incubator and they'll usually provide a workspace for free in addition to money, education, etc.",

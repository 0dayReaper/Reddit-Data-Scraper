    "postText": "For the past two months I have been selling lollies and soft drinks in my highschool with my friends. I buy all the product and get all the profits, although I give them some freebies every time they help me. My parents support me and don't mind if I get in trouble, although after I get suspended they say I must stop. I live in Australia, so we don't have any lockers which I could stash my goods in. Recently I've been caught, the coordinator of my grade pulled me out of class and told me that she has heard that I've been selling. I denied it. She didn't seem to care too much about it and let me go.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIn a class, my friend pulled out a pack of lollies from my bag as a joke. At the time, we had a sub teacher and he said, \"Are you the boy's that I've heard are selling lollies and drinks at school? If so, keep it up!\" I'm sure that all the teachers are talking about this in the staffroom in their lunch break.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI make about $110 in sales a day and around $55 profit. I also use a card reader, 75% of the sales are done by card. I bring a second bag to school with 30 soft drinks and carry the lollies in my regular school bag. In class, I keep the second bag next to one of my friends across the room, just in case the go through my bags, they will find lollies, but no drinks.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI believe a good way to minimise the punishment when I get in trouble again is to play the victim role next time I get in trouble and deeply apologise instead of denying the truth. If I were to deny it, I may be off the hook, but if I get into trouble again, it could be much worse. I was also thinking about creating a fake note book that had a low amount of sales each day to show to the coordinator when I get into trouble again. Hopefully, this will make her think that I'm not making that much money, so it's not that serious.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI'm wondering how I can reduce my risk of getting caught and if I do get caught how to minimise the punishment? Any suggestions or comments would be much appreciated, thank you.",

Pitch it as a real life teaching exercise.  If you don't have a business/marketing teacher, draw up a business plan and present it to the school principal \"Hey, I've heard there is someone selling contraband soda and candy.  I have a proposal that we create a legal candy shop that can be regulated but that will undermine the illegal selling\"  Profits would go to the school, but you become the distributor and can markup product that you sell to the shop.",

If the sale of the stuff is prohibited, you need to have a spot in the morning before school. Tell everyone for the inconvenience you will drop price on something, or have some kind of buy one get one promo every Wednesday. Or first 10 people get free lolli with purchase of soda. Some rules you can bend, some break. School is the primary objective, the job is secondary. Also at 250$ in profit weekly, order a pallet of soda. Drastically reduce the price. Promo Promo Promo. Any little free item, even a cheap one that costs you nothing sets you apart.",

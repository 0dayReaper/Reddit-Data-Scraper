    "postText": "I've run my own agency business for 20 years now. For some time I've been considering starting a blog to discuss various topics around starting your own business from scratch, sales and marketing, finding clients, running the books, hiring and firing, building team culture, etc. \n\nI know it's a lot of a work and I'm not necessarily a writer. It's a big commitment if you want to create content monthly or weekly. Also, there's no shortage of content around building a business. But I read a lot and I personally like a lot of different perspectives on things. \n\nSo why am I considering this? There's a few reasons: \n\n1. It's a good way to reflect on the last 20 years in business (almost like a diary).\n2. While I am no Steve Jobs or Richard Branson, I'm sure I have some unique perspectives on things that someone, somewhere may find thought provoking.\n3. My kids are just entering their teenage years and my daughter is going to intern for us this summer. I think about ways I can share my story with them. They may not care much now, but someday I hope it will be interesting and/or inspiring. \n4. Someday when I retire, sell, or flat out quit working I could have this \"project\" to keep me busy and/or make a little money.\n\nI would love some thoughts from the community. What's the pulse on new business blogs from \"unknown\" folks? Are these reasons compelling enough? Thanks all \ud83d\ude4f",

I wouldn't publish your first blog post or podcast until you have 5-7 in the bank.  \n\n\nDoing that allows you to figure out the process and time frame of content creation, gives you \"room for life\" when something happens at work or home and you can't do anything for a week or two, and if you can't do 5 to 7 'in the dark', no way you'll survive in the light. Bottom line if you think it's a good idea, do a few blogs to start and if you don't accomplish that (nothing wrong with interests changing) then no one is the wiser.",

After this much agency life we are kind of thinking \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d or what can keep my mind active and keep me in the game a bit once we are no longer running our businesses.\n\nI\u2019d say that just a blog is probably not the right medium TODAY. Since Google reader and such no longer exist you\u2019ll likely be posting to yourself and it will just be a diary.\n\nLikely better off getting active posting nuggets on Twitter or doing a newsletter on substack or a place you can tap into and existing community.\n\nBut. Yes! Do something \u2026 I need to do the same. Clients though, just always getting un the way. ;)",

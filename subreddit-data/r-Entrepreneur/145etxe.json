            "comment": "I'd say how much you want to spend on one versus the other depends a lot on what you're trying to do. If you've got a custom web app with functionality that isn't off-the-shelf, you definitely need a good developer. If it's something that you can do with a precanned solution like Wordpress or Bubble, maybe not.\n\nBy the same token, if you're putting out a rough prototype, or something where looks aren't that important, then you might be able to use a premade theme rather than using a designer, while if you need something slick, a designer is a must have.\n\nSo it all comes down to what your plans are. Also, although there are people who can do both design and dev, they're few and far between. Most of the developers I know (myself included) are terrible artists.",

Square space for most simple businesses/services etc.\n\nNow if you want to build a platform, SaaS tool or app this requires a different set of tools equally easy and doable it totally depends on your preference but you ultimately need three parts a front end (the bit we see), the platform you build on and the databasing. PM me if you want i've helped a lot of people get things off the ground and run my own stuff. People focus a lot on getting something to see rather than thinking about the whole process. I got into all of this because i went the WRONG route every step of the way at the start.",

I often have to clean up messes on both ends of a project when a client comes to me because they talked with someone who said they could do both, when they in fact, could not. Make sure they have work they\u2019ve done before and can share it with you. \n\nWhat are you building? You probably need both roles (whether they are done by the same person or not). But you might be able to get away with one or the other if you\u2019re building something simple or only need a proof of concept.",

They\u2019re two very different skillsets that requires years to master. Finding someone who can do both at a professional level is very rare and they will be more expensive than hiring them out separately. I personally wouldn\u2019t hire a designer/developer to work for me. I run a web agency, I only work with designers with formal educations and I code their work. I don\u2019t have the time to learn design and it\u2019s not worth it for me.",

Or you already have a substantial customer base producing considerable amount of money e.g., 100k per month, and trying to optimize for customer experience?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow maybe there is no absolute line to tell which one you're at. \n\n**In the early days when you're trying to figure our the core problem-solution fit**, hiring a developer may be a wiser choice (speed up rate of producing new functions, potentially) and outsourcing the interface via third-party (I assume it would take less time to get done than if you outsource the developers to build web features).\n\n**In the later days when your web functions are relatively 'complete'**, you might then want to consider hiring a designer to optimize the UI/UX and make the experience of using it more pleasant (we are all humans after all).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEspecially if your product is relatively rich in functions/features, it might be wiser to recruit the developer before the designer, sequentially speaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers &amp; regards,\n\nCommander Cody",

Maybe if your landing page needs a bit more of originality you can hire a designer when your app is already working. \n\nStill, I may be a little biased because I'm more of a developer than a designer.",

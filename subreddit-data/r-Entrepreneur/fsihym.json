    "postText": "10 years ago I was given  a serious mental health diagnosis, my world was flipped upside down. I was in my second year of college and I was hospitalized for a month. Upon coming out my mom (a psychiatrist), my therapists, and doctor all recommended I track my mood. I didn\u2019t agree with it, but it came at a cost.\n\nI struggled  with my mental health for 2 years and slowly learned the wisdom of mood tracking and seeing how what I do impacts my mental health.\n\nNot wanting to use the flimsy paper given by my psychiatrist and unhappy with the mood tracking apps at the time, taught myself to code and built myself a mood tracker that was used by 1/4 million people, featured by Apple on the front page of the App Store, and generated around $100k from a freemium subscription.\n\nI\u2019ve now built an automatic mood tracker called Mis\u00fc because the top reason folks stop tracking is that manually tracking anything makes it a hard habit to keep up.\n\nWhat is Mis\u00fc?\n\nMis\u00fc ([www.misu.app](http://www.misu.app/)) automatically tracks your mood through facial micro-expressions while you use your computer. Mis\u00fc helps you learn about your mood trends, as well as how various apps and sites impact your mental health. Would love your feedback on the app.\n\nTurns out that 10% of the U.S. has tracked their mood in the past, and using Mis\u00fc, people track their mood for 10x longer than they would for manual tracking.\n\nFast Company covered wrote an [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90483768/if-covid-19-news-has-you-down-this-mood-tracking-app-can-help) on Mis\u00fc today. \n\nIf you want to try Mis\u00fc and avoid our email capture (available for Mac): [www.misu.app/get-misu-app](http://www.misu.app/get-misu-app)\n\nIf you want to be notified when Android, iPhone, Windows and Linux versions, sign up [here](https://dan898734.typeform.com/to/MJJrk7).\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about:\n\n* Where I see the future of mental health tech / industry\n* Raising VC/angel funding as a solo founder (been rejected +100 times and have raised nearly $1m)\n* Learning to code without any prior background\n* Why I choose to use webcams when privacy concerns are at an all time high\n* The experience of having cofounder relationships not work out\n* Surprising things we\u2019ve learned about the product so far\n* A funny fundraising story where my tech read my anxiety during a meeting and the investor called me out.\n* Working through the inevitable doubt that comes when runway is low and momentum is lower\n* Learnings from making pivots (x3) to the business strategy.\n\nUPDATE. Going to take some time for my mental health. Thank you so much for the questions and discussion. Upvote the unanswered questions you want answers to and I\u2019ll answer more tomorrow. Feel free to ask more",

There is more like email and name, and that's all in out privacy [blog](https://www.misu.app/privacy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can you talk about the webcam decision?\n\nChoose the camera because, similar to dogs tails, our faces seem like the most expressive organ of our body. This is the first step, there are other, less intrusive ways to detect mood, which we're working on, like a mobile app that tracks mood without any face data, rather from pedometer, GPS, accelerometer, and phone usage (with the ability to not send any of that data to a server).",

I'll take a stab at it here:\n\nI was actually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, hospitalized for 30 days, later became so depressed I was sleep 12 hours a day, sitting on my computer for the other 12, switching between Reddit, Facebook, Netflix, and League. I was in this cycle for weeks, living with my parents.\n\nI remember one  Sunday afternoon, while on my computer and eating a big bag of chips, my mom was  12 feet away from me at the dining room table, and I heard her start crying. The story I told myself was that she was losing hope her son would ever recover and function normally / independently.  My mom, the psychiatrists whose job it is to fix people like me, was losing hope.\n\nAfter being persistently nagged by my dad to go to the gym with him daily, I finally went once. Two weeks later I went again. Eventually I was going even other day on my own. And finally started feeling glimpses of happiness again as spring came around.\n\nAs I started feeling happy again, I stopped taking meds. I became manic and landed back in the psych ward for another 30 days.\n\nAfter that visit it took me 6 months to get back on meds. I toyed with them, until realizing that they actually really help my anxious, depressed, and manic states. So I take more when I notice those are being elevated, and take a baseline amount in more normal states. An example, after my cofounder and I decided to stop working together, I knew that'd be hard on me, so I proactively increased my dosage.\n\nTracking my mood daily on this journey for the last 3 years has helped me learn more about how certain things impact my mood positively/negatively and this empowers me to make better decisions for my mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you feel better about this information being shared in this post. I know I do. Thank you for bringing it up. And curious if you have other questions, curiosities, or trepidations.",

I admire you for being open about your Bi-Polar and discussing in real terms how it impacted your business life. Surely like many others who get frustrated with casual use of the term \"oh they are acting Bi-Polar\" today just as others who have serious ADHD and Obsessive Compulsive may find it dismissive when someone uses those terms casually (as either a compliment or a pejorative) the use of exact terms can be frustrating.\n\nI myself have worked very closely with people who are diagnosed with various items that are listed in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual). I would say it is a difficult to describe what a person is dealing with in a manner that balances Clinical terms with personal views with Medical necessity that is also terse as well as not unduly impeding on the Client/Consumer/Patients rights to privacy and to express their truth of how they subjectively feel living in their condition.\n\nMy Mother was a Psychiatric nurse on a Children's unit in the 80s and Early 90s that would accept in-patent treatment plans for children who had emotional disorders that may present like depression but would end up in the Borderline or Autism spectrum or need to have other investigation all together to determine if the issue was instability at home. As you may know, some of these issues cannot be dealt with drug intervention and this may actually lead to worse outcomes.\n\nI also am aware that like many items in the DSM there are many types and sub-diagnosis of the disorder (For Unipolar as well as Bi-Polar depression) that help to statistically describe both on severity and how it reacts to external factors like seasons and perhaps medical treatments. Mood tracking is a key to finding out correct interventions that work best with minimum negative impact. \n\nFor many, the long term use of harsh medications can be burdensome, especially if they do not take the time to realize how the side effects of certain treatments are actually affecting their moods and health in ways that are in a feedback with their other lifestyle choices. And while in-patient methods of intervening in the lives of those who are experiencing distress is often viewed as more distressing than medications, that may not be the view of all. Thank you for sharing your experiences.\n\nI would end with a quote from a cousin of mine who works with children with Autism and who also have deafness and other neurological co-morbidity. \"If you've met one Autistic Child, you've met... One Autistic Child\". More ability to recognize the unique treatment needs and history of those who suffer from Emotional and Mental distress is an admirable endeavor.\n\n(EDIT - typos fixed at keyboard as first draft was on Phone)",

It's an interesting disease because I've done crazy things during a manic episode like score a horror film in almost no time that eventually was nominated for best original score. Then right afterwards I wanted to kill myself.\n\nWhen manic, any task or learning session becomes very easy and nothing stops you and self doubts disappear. Anything you've ever wanted to learn instantly appears possible and you uncontrollably have an attitude of, \"oh I'll just learn that and do that, no big deal.\"\n\nThe problem is that it doesn't last and you swing to the other side which lands you in bed for months not wanting to eat.\n\nAt least in my experience.",

Why can yours potentially be better? Who is your target market?) In general, I'm an enormous fan of B2B -- it's just so much less treacherous, more predictable, generally less competitive, and I'd rather charge 2000 people $300 a month than 200,000 $3 a month. (Businesses will pay way, way more for things, but there's a smaller market) It's not as sexy as general consumer stuff, but the upside is you actually get paid.   \n\n\nThat said, from the coding end of things, figure out the platform you want to deliver this on (desktop, mobile, web, etc.) and let that drive the framework and languages you use--then just get to work. Honestly, every resource you need is available at your fingertips. I joke that I built a company off of stackoverflow and google. Start watching youtube videos, take free classes, google everything, and start coding and then keep coding. You will be terrible at first, it's frustrating, and there's a lot of long, long nights, but it gets easier with time. It's more motivating when you're building something that is meaningful to you as opposed to a hello world app.   \n\n\nInitially, 90% of my time was spent reading and researching because I didn't know anything. Once I felt like I had sufficient background, I'd build a rough concept and see how it performed--did it feel good? Was it intuitive? If it didn't, I'd take take a new approach. Sometimes I'd fail completely and have to come back to that feature months later. I've never built a video editor, but I suspect it's fairly complicated and information out there is less readily available, so that may very well be a tough project.",

Of course, if you want to do something like OP where it uses facial detection and more advanced algorithms, you may not necessarily want to do it in JS (Javascript), but JS is what I'd recommend to most beginners. Go to /r/learnprogramming and search for \"full stack\" for tutorials. Full stack development means you create both what the site looks like and functions (frontend), and how it stores and handles data (backend), hence the full \"stack\" of what a site can do. JS is particularly interesting because it can be used for both, unlike most languages.\n\nIf you are interested in the more machine learning side, you can choose Python as that's mainly used in machine learning and data science. If you're interested in mobile apps as well, you can learn Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.\n\nIf you want to program robots or more lower level stuff, you can learn C, or Rust these days.\n\nI gotta give a shout out to Flutter which lets you create mobile, web, and desktop apps from one codebase but I'm not sure if it's the best choice for those just starting out.\n\nThe /r/learnprograming wiki has a lot more in-depth information (/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq).",

If you aren't figuring out how to solve something, you aren't learning to program. \nProgramming is the way you approach something and break it down into smaller tasks. \"Do these 4 things over and over until something happens, then do this\". Doesn't matter the language you learn in because the goal isn't to learn the language. You aren't learning Spanish or French, you are learning how languages work. Once you can say \"ok in order to communicate this, I need to used the past tense, and I need to conjugate the verb to match\"(programming) then you can say \"ok, how do you do that in Spanish, or French\" (language)\n\nIve got a perfect video that I will edit in here shortly\n\nEdit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/fin7bf/children_write_instructions_on_how_to_make_a_pb/",

It's a difficult language when you get to the complex stuff. *cough* polymorphism *cough*\n\nJavascript is just a bad language fundamentally, but very useful, so I normally advise people to learn it second because, while useful, it's just so damn inconsistant it frustrates new people.\n\nC++ was my first language but I would never advise people to go down that route, very complex, huge barrior to entry.\n\nObjective C... Just no... please don't do that to yourself.\n\nC, yeah that's a nice middle ground but it lacks a lot of object oriented stuff which is good to learn.\n\nJava and C#, they're a nice middle ground. Intellij and Visual studio are amazing IDEs and when there is so much documentation around the two languages it's very rare to not find a solution to a common problem.\n\nAlso java has baeldung... and it's amazing.",

We were struggling for months before and I sold everything that meant anything to me (MacBook, drone, pet snake). Shortly after, I was let go from my under-the-table restaurant job due to Covod19, which means I'm not eligible for unemployment since it wasn't on the books. My only income is from my military disability from the VA (70% PTSD rating). I'm two months behind on rent as of tomorrow and my apartment complex is pursuing action. I eat around once every two days at this point. Oh, and I'm bipolar which is just the icing on the cake of my life. \n\nMy mood chart is a fucking flatline. I've been doing it for a few weeks now and it's just depressing. How do I keep going? This is so taxing.

How much processing power do you think this would consume? \n\n- A few people have mentioned privacy which I understand. There is obviously a big incentive for companies like yours to sell this data to advertisers, and I'm sure many VCs would be interested for that reason. Do you have any intention to sell any of this consumer data? What will your privacy policy look like? \n\n- How will you measure sleep, exercise, etc?

I'm very ADHD and I fall into these cycles of hyperfocus and burnout/depression. I want to track them enough to predict my pattern and prevent burnout. I've tried every tracker on Android and most of them are pretty lame or can't export data or something like that. I really like how sleep as Android automatically tracks my sleep because I go weeks without remembering to check in quite often. It sounds like your microexpression mood tracker could really compliment that auto tracking too.",

For example, if someone is at work all day and only uses their laptop for a little while in the evening, is that still effective or does a person need to be using it consistently throughout the day?",

I will be starting a computer science degree next year and I will be specializing in computational neuroscience or cognitive psychology. My goal is to make technology that can help people just like you have. Your insight would be invaluable to me and if you are willing to answer some of my questions that would be amazing.\n\n\\- I'm wondering what it is like to raise capital in this space, are people hesitant to invest in mental health technology? \n\n\\- Do you find that there is a lot of competition in the space?\n\n\\- After the $1M raise have you seen a significant increase in revenue for your business? \n\n\\- I would love to know within what time frame you were able to make the 100k using the freemium model and if you had to put most of that back into the business.\n\n\\- Did you have a job/school to go to while the app was generating revenue or were you working on the business full time?",

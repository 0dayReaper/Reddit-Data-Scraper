Local websites are easier to rank since, yknow, less competition. \n\n2) how competitive your niche is. Ranking in, say, CBD niche is hella harder than ranking a pet site. Likewise, ranking for \"personal injury law firm NYC\" is hella harder than \"landscaping lake Tahoe\"",

Test your site with this \n\nhttps://pagespeed.web.dev\n\nIf it scores under 50, whatever SEO you do to the site will not be as effective. Google ranks your sites based on the mobile scores and performance. So you need that sorted out before anything. If you\u2019re using a page builder it will be impossible to get good load times because of the bloated code under the hood. \n\nThen there\u2019s content. How many words are on your site? Ideally you want over 1000 words on your home page. Do you now how to structure that content and where your keywords go? Do you know what you need to write about? That\u2019s the job of a copywriter. \n\nThen there\u2019s the outreach. You won\u2019t show up in the front page overnight. It takes time. Google takes 6-12 months to properly rank your site and determine your authority in your subject matter. So while you do that, you need to run targeted google ads for short term growth and sustainability. \n\nYou also need to build quality backlinks. Good SEO people have a list of good directories m and sites they can get your site linked on and increase your website SEO with them. They also write targeted blog posts and other content creation to rank on google. \n\nThere\u2019s so much that goes into it. It\u2019s more than just finding some dude on Fiverr to \u201cdo SEO\u201d. It\u2019s not that easy and straight forward. It\u2019s more targeted, purposeful, and time consuming.",

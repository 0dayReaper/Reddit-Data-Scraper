    "postText": "I\u2019m a vertically integrated self publisher. I write, illustrate, design, produce, fulfill, and market my books and card decks. I sell on Amazon Etsy and my website. As well as the occasional bulk order. I have an awesome fan base in some of my niche topics, which has made marketing pretty easy. I get most of my business through instragram posts and tictok videos  (no ads, just posting content). I get dips and rises in sales throughout the year depending on if a bigger creator gives me a shoutout, if I go on a podcast, or if one of my posts gets a lot of views. \n\nBut I\u2019m not growing big enough to feel like I can hire someone to take over my shipping, and if I put my thousands of books and decks in a fulfillment center I\u2019ll loose a lot of profit and I\u2019ll need to find other work to do. Drop shipping is not an option for my card decks which are half my products. So I feel a bit stuck at home with my inventory and slow growth. I\u2019m trying to get creative with other ways to put myself out there. My ideas:\n\n1.Hire a publicist to get me in journals or podcasts (podcasts have been huge boosts in the past but I don\u2019t know where to find the right publicist. \n\n2. Get a publisher. Even though my books have been really successful for such a small outreach I\u2019ve done (2k insta followers and 1.5k tictok) publishers don\u2019t seem to be interested in self published work. \n\n3. Run more ads or make more content. \n\nSo my question is, does anyone have experience with getting over this hump? What would be the best course of action to get to a higher exposure? I feel like other people I know have somehow gotten the floodgates open to large audiences or had investors. Is there a cheat code?",

            "comment": "Content. Content. Content.\n\n1. Figure out how much you need to sell and profit to hire someone to manage shipping. Write that number down and give yourself six months to get there. Commit to working your butt off for those six months for the ramp up where you\u2019re going to work longer hours to market which means you\u2019ll have more orders to fill. Know that number and commit to a time frame. Start writing your processes down step by step so when you do hire you\u2019ll have Standard Operating Procedures someone can follow. A good book for this is the EMyth. \n2. Write a weekly or monthly newsletter\n3. 10x your posts on social. If you aren\u2019t sure what topics start with the questions your most often asked.\n4. Read the book Building a Storybrand. Use it to rewrite your homepage and guide future social media posts. Listen to their podcasts as well - Business Made Simple has many small business interviews with great insights to grow. Marketing made simple podcast has great ideas for marketing.\n5. Direct ppl to your website (assuming the margins are higher)\n6. Does your website look legit or is it dated with poor branding? I wouldn\u2019t suggest a huge investment here now, but you want to make sure your site is clean and \u201con brand,\u201d and you want to focus it on conversions. \n7. Take a day to list out 100 podcasts that have the right audience for you. Write the name, find their contact information, etc. Then write an email to each one asking if they\u2019re looking for guests.\n\nAll of that is easy and near free, just an investment in time. Once you see money coming in from this activity invest more. \n\n8. Find an industry conference or industry adjacent conference (meaning if your typical customer is a female over 30 interested in holistic alternatives to medicine, find a conference for that. You want something where your customers are at, but you\u2019re also unique. \n\n9. Start your own podcast. Invite the other podcasters you\u2019ve worked with to be your first few guests.\n\nGood luck!",

So look at what you can do as the head of the company to be more efficient with your time, such as block scheduling, using calendaring software for appointments. \nThen how can you streamline the process of creating a product?\nHow can you sell more product more efficiently? Can you hire a VA to set appointments up? Can you get into business market - selling to companies, maybe licensing?\nAnd so on. \nMarketing in my opinion is the last process to touch as it can be a big e Penske if you do not know your market.",

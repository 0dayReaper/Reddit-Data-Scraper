Are you a graphic designer? Customer acquisition specialist? Subject matter expert?\n\nSelf-efficacy also counts, but if you had that you wouldn't be here asking to be spoonfed answers.\n\nBasically at this stage you probably don't bring any more value than an idea. I'd work on that, before trying to build a team",

Just like how a website listing all local designers in a way is a competitor to Photoshop (as some people think that if only they get Photoshop they'll be a designer, but that purchase might be diverted into them hiring a designer if one's easily available to them).\n\nAsking someone to build such a plattform for free(/future profit) is quite an ask, because they will have to spend at least months using up their own savings to pay their bills and buying food simply to get something in place.",

    "postText": " TL;DR at bottom - I apologize ahead of time if formatting is terrible. I don't really understand Reddit formatting. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that my initial product, the one this guide is based off of, was very simple. It's 100% polycarbonate. No metals, electronics, textile, etc. It's also extremely small. Maybe 4\" in length, 1\" height, and .5\" thick. Also, I will not disclose my product because there are still corners in the market I have not captured yet but am in the process of capturing.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTOTAL COST: $5,485.33 (+/- $500)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst step: Ideation and Market Assessment \n\nMy cost: $0 \n\nYou have to have an idea. How and whether you choose to litmus test the market or not is up to you. I personally just looked at my market and saw that no one had created a product for it. There were videos with hundreds of thousands of views on how to jerry rig up a device that accomplished what I eventually simplified and mass produced. It was a bit of a risk and at every stage I'd have doubts about whether or not I was wasting my time creating something destined to fail. I went into this product expecting to sell 1,000 units over 2 years.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext step: Design \n\nMy cost: $363.33 \n\nThe next step for me was designing. I drew a very crude drawing on a sticky note at work and wasn't really sure where to go from here. I figured I would need a 3D prototype somehow. I found a local business that does 3D printing, but even better, they did 3D CAD (Computer-Assisted Design) as well. So I was able to explain to them my concept, an engineer made a CAD model (we had to make a few adjustments before getting it just right). Then I had prototypes printed out. I'm not sure what each charge was, but going through my banking history, I can see my charges for this were: $140, $30.46, $170.46, $22.41 - so that's my total CAD and prototyping cost for this phase. Here's a price list from the company I used for CAD and prototyping: [https://imgur.com/a/uMCB5NW](https://imgur.com/a/uMCB5NW)   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext step: Registering Your Business \n\nMy cost: $130 \n\nI probably should have done this step before prototyping but I was learning as I went and wasn't extremely sure whether or not this would come to fruition. Once it became evident that I was actually going to do this, I got an EIN assigned (free) via [IRS.gov](https://irs.gov/). I went through the local name filing and LLC. filing $45 for the name filing fee and $50 for the LLC filing fee (+$35 for expedited service). Also set up transaction privilege tax and anything else I may not be able to think of at this moment.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext step: Mass Production \n\nMy cost: $4,600 \n\nThis is a part in any consumer product where I think a lot of people get stuck. I will outline my process, though it'll vary depending on your product. My process is the way I found with zero guidance. There very well could be more efficient processes that I am unaware of, but this process has served me now for 3 separate, original, inventions. \n\nI had a CAD in .STP and .STL formats. I had prototypes printed. The company I used for my CAD offered to run me a batch of cold casted product for about $12/pc. I put down a 20% ($240) deposit for a run of 100 pieces. There were several attempts to make the product, but the quality was always just not quite there. I think cold casting just cannot achieve the quality I needed for my product. Not only that, but the end product was quite heavy. I didn't follow through with the product and just cut my losses on the deposit. They tried and that matters in justifying my losses, but in the end, they weren't cut out for the work. \n\nSo I reached out to some injection molding companies in the US. One notable one I remember was ICOmold. I found them through some websites as I was searching for an injection molder. They were suggested because they either have no or low MOQ (minimum order qty) and they were supposedly low-cost. I got an instant quote from them and the pricing for that came out to, as far as I understood the quote, $11,520. [Here is the quote I received](https://imgur.com/a/iUKLlsw). Unfortunately, I didn't have $11,500 so I kept looking. Eventually, I decided to reach out to businesses on Alibaba. I found businesses that made products similar to mine or made products that used materials similar to mine (polycarbonate) and simply asked if they could injection mold custom designs. I may have even put out an RFQ (Request for Quote). I got several responses and quotes, and though there were some cheaper quotes, I settled on another company simply because they pointed out issues with the design that other companies had missed. Draft angles and thickness issues, etc. So I could tell they knew what they were doing and provided good quality. They re-engineered the design to be injection mold compatible free of charge. [Their quote](https://imgur.com/a/f0bwuaY) for the mold and 1,000 units (the product is made up of 3 separate pieces that join together) came out to $4,350 before shipping. They made some 3D printed prototypes on a seemingly very high end machine because it almost looked like an injection molded product with how smooth and well-made it was. It was the best prototype I had received up to this point. I paid $50 to have that prototype shipped. Then another $200 to have my first batch of 1,000 final products shipped from China to the US. \n\nProduct arrived, looked fantastic, and was ready for sale.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal step: Sales \n\nMy cost: $392 + varying sales/fulfillment fees \n\nThis step was interesting because I didn't really do any advertising at first for the product. I paid for Wix for 1 year ($204 but after leaving the site, they sent me a 50% coupon so I paid $102). I built out a website and got an Amazon seller's account ($40). I listed the product on Amazon for $40USD/pc. My costs per piece not including the mold are about .55c/pc. Then there are Amazon fees and packaging. Amazon fees are something around $6 per sale for me. Packaging is pennies on the dollar - I use polybags and card stock paper toppers. I know I should, but I don't even take packaging costs into account because the margins are so large. One thing about listing on Amazon is you need UPC codes usually. These are supposed to be obtained via GS1. I bought 10 UPC's for $250 via GS1. Since there was already a market, I didn't really need to advertise it. People just searched basic keywords on Amazon and I was the only option. \n\nOnce it was listed, it started gaining its own traction. I got 4 or 5 sales the first month and it climbed and climbed from there. I remember when it hit $700/week in profit, I was kind of freaking out thinking I had made it and couldn't get over how proud I was of myself for creating this mass produced product - I had never manufactured a tangible item before, so it was really cool for me. Sometimes I would just be sitting and turn to my buddy and say, \"Dude, I can't believe I created this. An actual product.\" It was pretty surreal for a while and I still have moments where I just take in what I've built. It's been just over a year since it hit the market. In that time, I have produced 3 more original ideas. The product is now on sales platforms in 4 continents (8 countries). There's a resale market for my product on eBay, which I found cool. The product alone pulls about $5,000 in profit per week (product costs me .62/pc after shipping from China to US. Then Amazon fees are $6 and change. I list product for $40USD on all sales fronts. Shipping costs about $6 within the US for every 100pcs I send to Amazon. Pretty insignifcant cost. I also sell on my website and on eBay - eBay is 13% in fees. Website I don't have fees aside from my subscription as well as shipping, which they pay for.) If you think about the income this product brings, it's really not much when you consider how large the audience base is. Which just proves to me that you really don't need to make a massively popular product to do well. If you can just take a tiny percentage of a large customer base, you can do quite well. I think a lot of people that call out other businesses for being deceitful about how successful they are (silicone rings) don't realize that. Small products can make large figures with the right margins and the right reach.  \n\n\nOne last thing I want to note; we are in an age where being an inventor is easier than it's ever been. We have an endless supply of information and resources. We are so well connected to engineers, designers, factories, etc. Before, the common sentiment was that ideas are worthless because everyone has them. I still believe this to be true. Ideas used to be extremely worthless because everyone had them and no one had the guidance to create them. We are now at the stage where it is very easy to take an idea to production on your own. It's still early enough in that stage that not many people understand the process. However, it's getting more and more saturated every day. One day, the only thing holding an idea from reality will be money, and even then, it will likely become a much smaller factor than it is now. I expect that product creation will soon find entry numbers comparable to hobbyists entering videography or coding, in that what was once a specialized field of knowledge limited to a small number of people, is becoming easier and easier to enter into with zero experience... if that makes sense. Right now, I feel like the thing holding people back is that they don't understand the \"How?\" of production and don't have the funding. They don't know where to start and the first speed bump they hit is where they stop. Those speed bumps are being scraped off by the efficiency of technology every single day. Soon, it'll be a straight road with a speed limit of 95MPH. I've given you a slightly upgraded suspension system, get ahead while you've got the competitive edge.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of my favorite tools in creating a product/business:   \n\n\n\\-Fiverr   \n\n\n\\-UpWork   \n\n\n\\-Alibaba   \n\n\n\\-Google   \n\n\n\\-Google   \n\n\n\\-Google   \n\n\n\\-Canva   \n\n\nQuick note: I waited to patent this product until a little after it hit the market because I didn't have the funding to do it before that. It's kind of a nich\u00e9 product and I wasn't worried about anyone stealing the idea - and they didn't. The patent application has now been filed, so it's PP and cost me about $2,500. \\*WARNING\\*: Once your product hits the public, you have 1 year to patent it. If you wait longer than that, you become ineligible to apply for a patent (or you can apply but risk someone challenging it if they find proof to go against you)   \n\n\nTL;DR   \n\n\n\\-Hire CAD designer\n\n\\-Prototype\n\n\\-Find production factory (I use Alibaba - they're not only useful for buying already existing products)\n\n\\-Sell\n\n\\-Profit?",

It was purely cosmetic but they were able to fix it at no cost to me. I feel like the whole process was pretty lucky. Felt like green lights the whole way, but I've used the same process 3 times now with perfect results. I think the most amazing deal was my 3D engineer and his pricing. I got really lucky with how inexpensive it was to have my product designed.",

If I request, they will actually mail me the molds. Patent is the best idea as soon as you can afford it - or, if you expect the product will have a very large market, you should do it first. I have a product coming out that I guarantee will be copied, so I am preemptively patenting it first in US, China (getting the right lawyers to ensure it's enforced), EU, and Japan. ",

I think it'd result in a very despondent attitude towards being an inventor and I'd be afraid to try again because I wouldn't be confident in my ideas anymore. I guess it was fortuitous that it worked out, but really, I attribute it to just good risk calculation. All it's done is make me more comfortable in my assessments of what I think are good inventions and I think that's pretty important to recognize. It's probably also important to recognize that if your product bombs, maybe you need to cut the loss and re-evaluate how good your grasp of people's desired products actually is.",

There is no sort of cross reference or anything that the government conducts on products being shipped to America to verify that they are not infringing on any patents. If I were you, I would assume that Chinese manufacturers will try to rip you off and sell your product. Once the manufacturer is regularly making thousands of these, they might try to sell the idea to other business people because they know it\u2019s valuable. They might not, but it has happened many a time.\n\nAlso, I really wouldn\u2019t trust them saying the would never do that either. Surely you have known them for a relatively short amount of time. They will likely tell you whatever it takes to keep you doing business with them. At the end of the day, that\u2019s all they care about.\n\nI am not trying to be a negative nelly or scare you, it\u2019s just that my favorite part of this sub is how people do their best to help each other out. I have never dealt with this, but I have read stories about others who have, and I would hate for you to have to deal with it too. Maybe contact a patent lawyer for help understanding the full scope of what protection your patent offers, or consider doing some more research. I definitely don\u2019t know dick about patents lol, but I know they don\u2019t offer complete protection for your idea!",

It's very encouraging to hear your experience, and I'd hate to hear that it was all for naught as your employer laid claim to your idea/product.\n\nAlso, I had a barber once when I was in the service who invented a pair of scissors that had a comb on one side.  This was in the late Eighties.  He described a process similar to yours wherein he got a patent and found a company in Taiwan to produce his product.  He found out that they would do one production run for his product to send to him, and then two runs to sell for themselves.  It may be easier to catch this now, but it's something to be aware of.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

I think I even asked if he wanted to help me fund it... he didn't seem interested. He also didn't really seem to believe it was a great idea. Since it's launched, he's made about $4k in sales selling his own batch of my product that I supplied to him at a heavy discount.",

This company seems to be marginally cheaper, I think because they use 718 Steel whereas the former uses NAK80. 718 Steel can do about 300k-400k/pcs and NAK80 can do 400k-500k. I will never make that many pieces so I don't have a preference over the HRC (hardness level) of the steel. The former also seems to charge 2-3x in shipping costs so lately I've been using the latter.",

For me, it was a calculated risk and I don't think even my factory realizes the profit it's making. Even if they did, is it worth spending the capital to copy a product that only brings in $250k/year? Considering there's already a majority brand so they can't assume $250k, maybe 50% of that but likely less. Then there's the fact that I have patents. I think it'd be more work than it's worth. However, I do have a new product in the works that I think will be a 7 figure business in its first year. That one is being engineered and produced domestically and has NDA's each step of the way. I do agree though, if it's a product that has a high probability of being copied, protect it preemptively. Another option is to have different components produced by different factories so no factory has the finished product or knows what it is. I've considered this but not sure how feasible it is.  ",

So now I try to have a lot of it packaged ahead of time.\n\nAdding emotes? I'm assuming you meant employees? I want to get this company to a $2mm/year business. I think at that point I will hire an employee or two. I expect to be able to achieve that figure within 16 months.\n\nThis was alongside a full time job up until I was making about $3,700/profit. At that point I pretty much did it full time. \n\nI plan growth by expanding into even more countries. I am continually producing new original ideas. The business is really becoming a known brand name in its community at this point, which is great. Nearly 100% gets reinvested. I have vowed not to take a paycheck until it's pulling at least $8k/week at which I want to buy an entry level supercar ($80k car). I only take money for things I explicitly need.

My product, even though it was the only of its kind, was on page 6 of results when using specific keywords. Once I started doing FBA it got to the first page and has now been an Amazon's Choice product ever since. I think FBA makes sense if the margins allow and you're pushing enough product. Amazon in and of itself is a platform to carefully consider. Some people want to build up their website traffic. This is a good idea if you know how to do SEO or AdWords. I don't. If I pulled my product from Amazon, I would probably only make $1,000/wk.",

In the beginning, I was irrationally paranoid that my engineer was taking so long to design it because he was trying to beat me to production, but once I started realizing that people I told the idea too didn't have my same vision and were not excited about the idea, I wasn't worried. My production factory didn't know what the product was either and they never asked. I think for the majority of people, if they just saw the product, they wouldn't know its use. So I had little concern in that regard.\n\n2: My ideas do get patented now. The only reason I didn't patent initially was because of lack of funding. Now I have a great patent agent and with the business income, the cost of patenting is not an issue.",

But there's still another 'brand name' competitor, so maybe half that... $62.5k per year. Likely less than half though, maybe $40k per year. \n\nIf they have the means to copy my product, there's much more profitable things to recreate than mine. $40k per year, may as well get an entry level desk job. Keep in mind, it's running a full time business. There's just not enough profit out there to justify competing with me at this point, I don't think.",

I literally just explained my idea and showed a crude drawing. He made a 3D model. We made a few iterations but that took very little of my time. I don't know how long he spent designing the model. Once the model was made, the same engineer did the 3D prints. Then it went to China where their engineer optimized it for injection moulding. The majority of time I put into it was researching how to get to the next step. I'm not sure how long that took. However, from start to finish - idea was in May, final mass produced product was in August. I'd say it took 2-3 weeks for my engineer to design it but a lot of that was simply because they always have multiple projects going on at a time. Then it took another couple of weeks for China to get it optimized for injection molding. Another couple of weeks to very final prototypes. Then a month lead time for mass production. Working with China always takes a little longer because each day = 1 back and forth email communication unless you turn into a night owl, which now I am because I'm always working on new products.\n\nNow, a basic product takes me about 6 weeks from start to finish. I'm working on an electronic product that is in its third month and is still in the engineering phase. A much more complex product. \n\nOpportunity cost was limited, most of it was just my time once I had an actual product and was rapidly expanding. Lots of longs days managing and building up the business social media pages, packaging product, mailing orders, building out the website, building partnerships with influencers, etc.",

            "comment": "Just a note- it costs a LOT less to file a provisional patent, which then gives you a year to file the non-provisional 'official' patent (which does cost significant money.) The provisional patent isn't actually reviewed or go through an approval process, it just establishes that you are claiming an invention on a certain date in case there is a dispute later (kind of like getting an early place in line, or putting your name down at a restaurant.) You don't make specific claims in a non-provisional patent, it's more a general description of your invention with enough info to establish why it is novel, what it is used for, etc. So you don't need a lawyer to write and file it (the whole point of the provisional patent application process is to make it less painful to develop and protect new inventions, so you don't spend thousands of dollars patenting ideas that ultimately don't go anywhere.)\n\nIn general the best time to file a provisional patent is before your invention becomes public (through retail launch, marketing, PR, etc.) If anyone tries to copy or patent your idea, you then have the provisional patent to establish the date of your invention. There is no need to file it too early though, since the filing date establishes the 1-year deadline on the non-provisional application. OTOH if say you were presenting your idea to large companies for licensing deals, filing the provisional patent app before you present your idea could give you some added security (in addition to NDA's, etc.)\n\nOf course you will need to apply and get approval for the 'real' non-provisional patent for you to ultimately be able to have a claim to and protect your intellectual property.\n\nIIRC the USPS patent database contains both provisional and non-provisional patent applications, so I think you can review other provisional patent applications at the USPTO web site to get a good sense of how they should be written. There are also plenty of online resources on how to create and file a provisional patent application (I recommend you find some if this subject is relevant to you, I have some practical knowledge of provisional patents but am not a lawyer!)",

Right now there is an opportunity for anyone that has an idea to follow that through and make it a reality. I think it still does take a special combination of abilities and opportunities, but it doesn't have to require a ton of cash or specialized know-how to make it happen. ... I also agree that right now is the time to take advantage of that opportunity.

Then one day, this kind of light went off to try and work with Alibaba factories. Several of them said they only resell products but I did get a handful that custom produced products. Went from there.\n\nI think the thing I'd do differently is slightly adjust the design that I've found minor issues with and probably never put down a deposit for the cold cast contract. Those were both very minor things though. I can't think of anything else I really regret. It felt like I had green lights all the way, which was very lucky for me.",

Not sure how the laser printer toner pans out, but I really don't keep track of these costs because they are so minimal and my margins are so large.",

I used a service called MerchantWords.com to look at the volume of relevant search terms on Amazon. My friend had a subscription so I used his, but I think it's $60 for a month. Another great resource I should have mentioned.",

    "postText": "I've always wanted to live in multiple countries (not visit, live) and am trying to get a job in Australia and then move to Europe for an MBA, making me a resident of 4 continents before I am 30 and a degree holder from 3 countries. \n\nIt's really important to me to do this but so is entrepreneurship. If I pursue my dream of living across 4 continents, I'll be delaying my entrepreneurial journey when I am probably most risk tolerant. \nPursuing entrepreneurship will tie me up for idk how long with the work and I might only be able to take short breaks and travel here and there. \n\nIt's a great dilema for me and I need help processing it.",

If none of that happened i know for a fact i would be in the same position at 30. (I have old emails with legit biz plans that i never followed through on cause i was partying).",

            "comment": "This is indeed a complex dilemma, and it's one that many ambitious individuals face: the balance between personal aspirations and professional goals. You're absolutely right that entrepreneurship often requires a significant commitment of time and energy, which can make it challenging to pursue other life goals simultaneously.  \nYet, it's not necessarily an either/or situation. It's entirely possible to combine personal pursuits with entrepreneurial endeavours. Many entrepreneurs have managed to build their businesses while traveling or living in different countries. They've used the diversity of their experiences to inspire and shape their entrepreneurial ideas.  \nOne aspect that comes to mind is the possibility of building a location-independent business, or a business that can be managed from anywhere in the world. The rise of digital technology and remote work makes this more feasible now than ever before.  \nOne of the recurring themes we explore in [The Champion's Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe) is how successful individuals balance personal goals with their professional aspirations. We've found that many of them embrace the concept of the 'portfolio lifestyle', where they pursue multiple passions and goals, often in different areas of their lives, rather than restricting themselves to a single path.  \nYour dilemma is not uncommon, and it's one many face daily - even me right now. I'm balancing passion, money, what I should be doing and what I want to do. But my theory is to try to blend them all into one.  \nWhatever you decide, best of luck on your journey! It sounds like you have some amazing experiences ahead of you, no matter which path you choose.",

Not all of them are great ideas, but I think a few are worth considering (depending on your skillset):\n\n1. Tour Guide Service: Start a tour guide service that offers unique and off-the-beaten-path experiences for travelers. You could specialize in a particular region or type of activity, such as adventure travel or culinary tours.\n\n2. Language Translation Service: If you are fluent in multiple languages, you could start a translation service that helps travelers communicate with locals in foreign countries.\n\n3. Travel Writing: If you have a talent for writing, you could start a travel blog or write travel guides that help people plan their trips.\n\n4. Travel Photography: If you have a talent for photography, you could sell your photos to travel publications or create a stock photo library for travel-related businesses.\n\n5. Online Travel Agency: Start an online travel agency that helps people plan and book their trips, offering personalized recommendations and travel packages.\n\n6. Travel App Development: Develop a travel app that helps people plan their trips, find local recommendations, and book activities.\n\n7. Travel Insurance Brokerage: Start a travel insurance brokerage that offers customized insurance plans for travelers.\n\n8. Travel Gear Rental: Start a rental service that offers high-quality travel gear, such as camping equipment, backpacks, and cameras.\n\n9. Language Learning Program: Create a language learning program that helps travelers learn the basics of a foreign language before they travel.\n\n10. Remote Work Consulting: If you have experience working remotely, you could start a consulting service that helps other entrepreneurs and freelancers learn how to work while traveling",

He was supposed to install the files after the purchase but asked for more money. I wasted even more money by changing hosting multiple times due to various issues. Ultimately, I dropped the project.\n\nHowever, 2 weeks ago, I launched a job board for [web developers](https://webdeveloperjobs.io/). And after two weeks (I was manually seeding curated jobs), yesterday I received a job post from a company. I'm feeling very happy. This is the same feeling I had when I made my first affiliate commission.\n\nFor those wondering:\n\nI got scammed by this [https://www.reddit.com/r/Domains/comments/lerlp8/selling\\_my\\_state\\_of\\_the\\_art\\_job\\_board\\_website/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Domains/comments/lerlp8/selling_my_state_of_the_art_job_board_website/)",

One recommendation as you travel this journey: spell-check is your friend :))) ... your post stands out not only for the good work you are doing, but also for several errors that seem to say \"I don't care.\" And of course, when it comes to your business, you should. Best of luck, no worries for the past, but can consider going forward :)))",

    "postText": "Title is pretty self-explanatory. \n\nI'll go first, this was 2020. I was running a website about nonfiction books. \n\nSpecifically a website that turned nonfiction books into short fun little stories. \n\n I decided one of the best ways to get traffic to the website would be to run Google Ads. \n\nBut instead of searching how to set up campaigns in Google ads or seeking the guidance / help of someone more experienced, I decided I would just \"figure it out\". \n\nLong story short my ignorance led to me losing hundreds of dollars because I had no idea how to set budget, add keywords, etc. \n\nAnd Google, despite being a trillion dollar company, has a horrible UI / UX. \n\nI ended up realizing my mistake a couple months into running these ads and shut them down. \n\nEventually I learned how to actually run ads (took some courses) and from there I actually grew my traffic, etc. \n\n*Now it's your turn to tell me about a business failure and what you learned from it.* \n\n***Oh and one last thing, you can find more cool startup stories*** [*here*](https://unheardroots.com/)***.***",

Study the market, learn marketing, and add some things to your inventory, skills, and tools but do not stop all work for marketing purposes. Marketing is never done improving, and if you do not have a product or service, well what are you going to market? Follow-through is a critical aspect of marketing. You cannot wait to start making the soup until I order it. No matter how good it is if I need to wait 4 hours for it. \n3. Time is a limited resource, placing a higher value on time will help you prioritize and reduce what feels like wasted or lost time on low-reward\" projects.",

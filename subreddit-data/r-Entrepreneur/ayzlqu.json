    "postText": "With all the success stories, I wonder if people would appreciate hearing about a sheer unadulterated failure of a business.\n\nIn 2017, I started my first business, selling with Amazon FBA. I followed every guru gimmic in the book. I sourced a niche product from China. but the niche became so saturated I ended up selling my product for next to nothing and giving away much of my inventory in the hopes of reviews/better ranking.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the money I lost:\n$4000 on inventory (500 unit order)\n$1000 for Freight Forwarder (Ocean freight)\n$1400 on pay per click ads (got out of hand really fast)\nAnother $1000 between professional photography and artwork/branding design\n$500 misc. (FBA subscription, barcode registration, product samples, etc.)\n\nI learned a lot for sure. My main takeaway was not to follow a cookie-cutter scheme that promises a guarenteed revenue stream after following 5 easy steps. Amazon FBA is not passive income, it's a full time job, one I had nowhere near the time for. If everyone is doing something, it may not be the best idea. Don't run off the cliff with the lemmings.\n\nAs much of a gut punch this experience has been, I have tried to learn from it, and have a better idea of what not to do in future ventures.\n",

You see all these great success stories that hype you up to start something on your own, which can really backfire. Many people are not ready to give in as its needed to or they do but many negative factors roll in making it harder to start your own journey, which unfortunately results in another failure story. \n\nI believe if more people shared their other less fortunate sides of the coin, then more people could learn from those and possibly achieve something out of those mistakes, but people rarely do. Its just probably the inner psychologic side of a human mind to be ashamed of failure. \n\nBusiness is tough, real tough, anyone who says otherwise is probably selling you crap. Its not all milk and honey so thankfully, the guys like OP who share their stories, make starter entreprenuers not do same mistakes. \n",

Yes, some luck as well, but there\u2019s plenty of other factors as well.\n\nI actually run a coffee circle locally in my city here devoted to this. To just get entrepreneurs and business owners talking, sharing, and collaborating. We share a big win and a challenge we are facing each month. People are naturally more hesitant to share at first, but once they start talking you\u2019d be surprised at how many similar things people struggle with, even in completely different industries.\n\nI\u2019ve lost friends and loved ones to suicide. Entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs alike. But that shit is real, and it hurts. I know this is more of an extreme situation, but I just want more people to understand that failure happens. It stings. It sucks. It makes you feel like shit. But it\u2019s a learning moment, and there\u2019s an extremely valuable story you get out of it. Start telling that story to others. You never know what direction it may lead you, as well as what other opportunities may result from it.\n\nI have nothing but respect for all you working to better yourself and create your best life.",

Most manufacturers are willing to go this low if they think its a sample, which, to be fair, it is. You're sampling the market on amazon to see if anyone will buy.\n2. Don't waste $1000 on graphics. There are people on fiverr who will do a 90% as good job for $50.\n3. Don't spend more than $100 on ads before you see a profit. If you aren't seeing a profit, then you have to change something drastically. Sometimes your product is simply wrong. Don't go throwing good money after bad.\n\nOverall i see this time and time again with new entrepreneurs. They think if they just throw enough money at a business it will work. Why act so recklessly? Why throw $5k into one product, when you don't even know if it will sell? Why not throw $3k towards 10 products, then whichever one starts to do well, drop the rest of the products, and throw $2k at the profitable one?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I spent about $1700 bucks and and then had all this inventory that I was trying to sell through my website, creating facebook ads etc. and nothing seemed to work. \n\nI didn't get my first sale until 2.5 months later, for an item on my website that I didn't even have the physical inventory for. I ended up sourcing the same bracelet from Aliexpress and shipping it to my customer but I wasn't really feeling the business any more.\n\nThis isn't exactly similar to your story, but I think an important lesson also is to not give up..In retrospect, I think about how I got one sale on the website after 2.5 months which was some kind of validation, that yes, people are willing to buy on my site, it *Can* work. \n\nHowever, I wasn't completely in love with the bracelets, it wasn't really me. \n\nI learned ALOT from that experience:\n\n\\- wordpress / woo commerce\n\n\\- hosting / SSL\n\n\\- Engaging with suppliers\n\n\\-Negotiating \n\nso yes I was out $1700 bucks but I still learned alot and now I'm more strategic and in the midst of launching a new ecommerce business.

I did all wholesale with 5 different companies. Those 5 companies changed their policies within a year of each other, giving exclusivity to one large seller (not me). My FBA business tanked. I was so discouraged and terrified of this model that I went in a different direction with my career. But I always loved doing Amazon. I love being behind a computer and researching and figuring out numbers. So within the last 6 months I\u2019ve decided to build it back up and it\u2019s going really well and I see the future of doing this full time again. Although if Ive learned any lesson at all about selling successfully on FBA... it\u2019s to diversify. Diversify your brands, items that you sell, etc. I lost 5 accounts and lost 98% of my business. If I lose 5 accounts now I would lose maybe 4% of my business. It happens all the time though, policies change, Amazon changes, companies change.... if you love it, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity with private labeling local USA suppliers with low minimums. I\u2019ve never taken a guru course from anyone. I do 90% wholesale and 10% RA. Just now starting to get into PL with local suppliers. Amazon is so fun for the math brained people!! But it\u2019s a slow and steady build.",

            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for sharing your story OP.  More people definitely need to hear this.  There's way too much lore around FBA as a way to make easy money.  The reality is that Amazon is an intensely competitive channel that will grind the majority of sellers to dust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be successful on Amazon (and in e-commerce in general) you have to understand your unit economics to the decimal.  You have COGS, paid marketing, the channel fee, FBA fees, and various other costs that rip through your margin dollars like a buzz saw.  Anyone who is impressed by articles like \"How I Made $22k a month selling yoga mats on Amazon\" should ask the guru who wrote it how much was left after he net out his costs.  They never mention that.  Usually the article is just a way to make money from affiliate marketing for Amazon seller tools.  It's highly unethical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, Amazon is a distribution channel.  Nothing more.  It provides a way for high purchase intent shoppers to discover your products and a way to get your product to them quickly.  That's it.  It's on you to figure out how to profitably acquire customers, which is very difficult.  CPC is high for paid search, and SERPs &amp; detail pages are full of competitor ads, many of which are lower priced and have 100x more reviews.  How will you compete with them when they're able to convert that traffic more efficiently?  Especially if they're a manufacturer....they have more margin dollars to spare on customer acquisition/discounting than you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Listing optimization\" is not an advantage.  Having better lifestyle images or titles or bullets or backend search terms than the next guy is not an advantage.  It's easily copied in an afternoon.  At the end of the day, your ability to grow on Amazon is a function of your ability to:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Profitably acquire customers\n\n\\- Retain customers\n\n\\- Not go out of stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's a full-time job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinding customers requires you to be hyper-targeted with your ads, so you're not wasting spend on less qualified audiences.  That takes constant attention and testing.  You also need to rank organically for at least some high impact keywords, to take some of the pressure off paid marketing.  But ranking organically requires steep discounts (or giveaways, like the Chinese do in huge numbers) to spike sales velocity, which is a drain on cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRetaining customers is difficult on Amazon, especially if you're not in vertical with repeat business.  Amazon does not provide enough support to sellers for remarketing to past customers.  Amazon DSP is one option, but it's not for small sellers, and I'd still take an email list.  Paying $20 to acquire a customer in a yoga mat business is not a great strategy.  You're lucky to make any money on that purchase, and there won't be future purchases to make that $20 acquisition cost worthwhile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot going out of stock is harder than it sounds.  You have to manage your cash well, something most new sellers have no experience with.  You are going to have working capital funding gaps that cause you to go out of stock, or force you to cut back on all your other spending (e.g. advertising) so you have cash to reorder before you go out of stock.  Financing growth of a physical product business is very challenging.  Most people never really think about this.  If your goal is to do $250k a year in sales, and your COGS is 40% of that, that's $100k in cash you need to pay your suppliers.  Let's say your average customer acquisition cost is 25% of your margin.  That's almost $63k in search ads.  You get the point.  You need a lot of working capital to turn this into a meaningful business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people are thinking, \"well, $250k a year sounds like a lot, I don't need to do that much in sales for it to be worth it\", think again.  After you net out your costs on that $250k, I'd be surprised if you had much more than 10% of that left.  So you'd be risking a considerable amount of capital for inventory, advertising, and other expenses to generate a return of about $25k in a year.  That's why I think anyone whose serious about doing this for a living should ask if they can hit 7 figures in revenue...sustainably.  Again, doing that kind of volume is a full-time job that requires a multi-faceted skillset...performance marketing, supply chain and inventory management, finance/accounting...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, rambling done.  Thanks for sharing your experience OP.  You learned some great stuff from this experiment...call the $8k your tuition for knowledge that's vastly superior to what you'd get in some MBA class.  Best of luck in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

                            "comment": "The problem is it's not just your supplier, it's any of the plethora of other manufacturers that make the same product.  The AliExpress/Alibaba sourcing shit as a business is dead.  All you're doing is buying cheap from China and reselling for more in the US.  There's nothing distinguishable about your product or brand.  In that environment, the winner is whoever has the most margin dollars to give away to acquire customers.  That's obviously the manufacturers...they can discount more and spend more on ads without going into the red.\n\nTo be successful you need to create an actual business that you intend to build out over the course of several years.  Bundling the same products &amp; sticking on some Fiver logo is not an advantage.  \n\nYou have to build a brand.  You shouldn't build a brand in categories where you have no chance in hell at winning.  You have to develop a unique product in a category that you have a strong interest in (i.e. won't get tired of in 6 months).  You need to be willing to put the work into content, for a brand site, for social channels, for distribution on other channels (e.g. podcasts, influencers, etc).  That doesn't pay off in the near term, but it gives you something in the longer term to compete with the low cost players.  That branded search traffic comes over to Amazon and converts extremely well, and you have greater loyalty with those audiences.  You have a better chance of making the economics of the business work.  \n\nThis is why starting a business is so hard -- you'll have to do all of that yourself.  hence the absurdity of talking about FBA like a passive income business.  any passive income that's generated via FBA is either not profitable or insignificant, tiny amounts of money (poor return on capital, esp considering risk).

As I have stated already, the numbers do not lie, I am speaking of the majority here and not the exceptions people. Yes there are some good Chinese people out there, but they truly are few and far in between. In fact, Chinese people are the worst offenders of Racism. The funny thing is, Most Chinese people in China actually sees the white man as stupid.\n\nAlso please understand the country's communism influence that cause the culture to be a certain way with these people. If you learn the language, the history and culture you will understand more. Instead of blatantly calling someone a racist cunt.\n\nMr Japanese over there trying to tell me something but, when I went to japan, the Japanese Taxi Drivers are telling me they don't want to serve mainland Chinese people because of their mannerism.\n\nYou should know people from Hong Kong look down on Mainland Chinese because of China's communistic thinking (Think CCP and Chairman Mao). Although they always give every fellow Chinese the benefit of the doubt, only to have been met with disappointment in the end.",

Someone eventually made a design similar to what I was gonna do and is now the leader in the niche. I think now you really have to focus on redesigning a potential product in some way to succeed.\n\nI found my current product by watching YouTube vids, seeing someone make something and figuring out just a better design.

Thanks.  \nI'm personally not in Amazon FBA.  \nBut to be frank, from an outsider's view about Amazon FBA business...  \n\n\nIsn't it simply just re-packing white label products into your \"own\" products, then using Amazon as a platform to sell.  \nIt feels like I'm 'hyping' mediocre products to earn on a high-margin. But actually, after factoring the other backend work and expenses like design, branding, ads etc... the margin ain't high at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all, I don't find it any difference to running your own e-commerce business using shopify or woocommerce etc... and reselling products instead.

But at least these same old 'brick &amp; mortar' business at least have better/proven products that are already selling on the market instead of your own branding... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps a lot of those gurus are simply documenting their 'start-off' success that probably died down and re-squeezing extra profit from another niche from the internet marketing business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just sharing my perspective...

That is one issue with selling on Amazon, you have very little control over people swooping in unless you're brand registered (which now requires a trademark).",

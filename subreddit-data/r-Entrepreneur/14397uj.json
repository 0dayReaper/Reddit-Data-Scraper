There are so many resources like this for free that without a ton of established credibility, I think free first is the way to go.   \n\n\nI know a colleague who started a community and with a lot of free resources early on but had a button on the site to \"buy her a coffee\" or \"donate to what we are doing\". I don't think she received a ton here, but within 6 months built a CoS community and launched a paid program with a long waiting list and bringing in \\~200k from these",

Make sure you have your niche watertight, and that is plugged into the demographics and audience controls in both platforms.  \n\n\nIf you see some positive results (low Cost per click/conversion/downloads), you are onto a winner - so dial up the $. If you don't, iterate and monitor again.  \n\n\nIt is different for everything. I am having great results with this for waitlist signups for my start-up currently, and have just started another side project, [The Champions Journal](https://thechampionsjournal.beehiiv.com/subscribe) to test a lot of my theories regarding writing, marketing, growing.  \n\n\nIt is a lot of trial and error, and using the knowledge of others to implement and iterate.  \n\n\nI follow some great people on Twitter and LinkedIn who provide extremely valuable content.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

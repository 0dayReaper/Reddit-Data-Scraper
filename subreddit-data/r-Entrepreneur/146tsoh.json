    "postText": "I've got a listing on Flippa for our business which sells ready made web app businesses. I wanted to understand some feedback on our current performance and what we should expect.\nIt has 20 days left on auction and have had 196 views and 14 watchers. I've had 2 messages, 1 very interested and another I think could be a scam. The one in question has messaged me on Telegram asking questions and is now ready to buy - told them to bid on flippa but wants to pay direct. Something doesn't seem right as I've had a couple of calls with parties but this lot are happy to go ahead without.\nNot sure what to expect with a trading business as first time used for a revenue generating business.",

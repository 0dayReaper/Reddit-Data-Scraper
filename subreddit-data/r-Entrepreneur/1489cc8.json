Something about talking to a person like a normal human being is a lot more natural to me than interviewing for a position. That said, you won't learn overnight. I've been doing this for so long, and I still learn every day. You'll be a junior dev until about your 2 year mark. Jr devs, on average, make about 40-60k depending on the language. It is easier, imo to get a junior dev role. A lot of my clients were looking for a junior dev. If I didn't scare you, I'd recommend getting into React Native and building mobile apps. Looks great on a resume. I learned it because I had an idea for a community built around introverts, so I built the app along with an offline idea manager app. Sonny Sangha has great tutorials on making clone apps like Uber 2.0, Tinder, etc. He'll get you started. If you're interested in learning even more, shoot me a message, I have a rubber ducky Discord where I share a lot of packages and libraries that will save you a significant amount of time that Sonny doesn't tell you about. \n\nIf I did scare you, I also own a marketing agency, though most of my clients carry over from the software agency. I have a few local clients that I went around town aquiring. email marketing is pretty saturated, but it's easy, and I see a lot of posts on UpWork and such asking for people. Mautic is a great open source solution that saved my clients thousands of dollars. I've built proprietary software for my software company that adds integrations with various lead generation services and CMSs.\n\nAlso to add, a lot of freelancers don't get insurance. I highly recommend you get it since you have no experience.",

I personally feel like AI demand is only going to get higher as more companys begin to implement it into their workflows and architecture. There's a lot of room for growth, and it's hard to know with certainty if the industry will continue to skyrocket, but it does appear that way. I will say it doesn't appear to have caught up in terms of average salary, but that's just from what I've been seeing. It wouldn't hurt to implement AI into your workflows, but honestly, pick what you like. I've worked with various languages throughout the years and what I might not like, you might love, so I'd say pick what you like and go with it. The way I see if, if a language has decreasing demand, you can charge more for your knowledge and skillset because you'll be one of the few who still know the language. I wouldn't just stick with one tech stack, I'd learn a few so you can have more opportunities.",

It's something that a lot of developers I've mentored who make the switch don't know about, and it blows their mind that it's that easy. Angular may have something like this that I'm not familiar with, but for a free platform (for the most part), it's totally changed my perspective on mobile development. There are, of course, some caveats, that I'd advise you to do some research on. For my purposes though, it has worked perfectly. I'd definitely advise looking at one of the tutorials from Sonny that I talked about in my previous post. He doesn't use Expo in all of his tutorials, but he can at least help get you started on the basics along with some of the more advanced pieces of React Native.",

We order everything straight from our importer and he always has what we need in inventory, or he gets ahold of it, and then ships the parts the same day.

Once you can afford a polisher and learn how to apply coatings, people will pay up to $1000 to have their cars coated.\n\nIt's just a very competitive market and you have to do a lot to make yourself stand out.",

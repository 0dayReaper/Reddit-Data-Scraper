In my mind, people come to to shop there go to items (especially produce and food). Obviously when I\u2019ve done it by myself, I\u2019ve made profit. \n\nShould I look at it from another perspective? Just feeling kinda guilty.",

Have desserts or other related goods to pair with your coffees or try and make friends with other sellers at the market who sell baked goods. 2. Approach local restaurants and cafes if they would be interested in buying your product or at the very least displaying your product. 3. Setup some chairs and tables at your booth, maybe have some cards or board games. 4. Handout sample shots. 5. Make sure you're engaging with everyone that walks by. Say good morning to everyone.

So I\u2019d try to focus more on getting people to buy. What makes your coffee unique or special? Some ideas to consider (and you would definitely know better if any of these could work for your business):\n\n1. Most importantly IMO, brew a large batch of coffee to bring with you for each roast. This serves two purposes. First, you can give out samples. Being able to try before you buy is likely important at your price point. Second, it\u2019s another source of revenue as you can sell cups of coffee to people looking to sip while they walk around the market.\n2. May or may not be a good idea for your brand, but consider selling ground coffee as well. Many people don\u2019t have a grinder at home or are not willing to grind before they brew. Maybe start with just ground coffee for your medium roast as opposed to all 3.\n3. Is there anything else you can sell to boost your average order? The maximum you can likely see per customer is $32 or two bags of coffee. Maybe you can partner with a local baker, for instance, and sell pastries as well. Than potentially gives you more traffic to your booth and a cut of those sales as well.\n\n\nBest of luck to you!",

Since coffee is fairly shelf-stable, I'd suggest having many bags of coffee (30-50) as you'll never sell the last few items on your table. Make your stand show an abundance of product. Fill your table with coffee bags and have a small step display so the bags aren't just flat on the table, have a bowl of beans out for customers to smell, show the green beans that you roast. Have your employee educate your customers on your process and the origin of the beans, flavour profile, etc. \n\nOnce you get clearance from the health department, give out small sample cups and sell by the cup as well if possible. People love to get a fresh cup of coffee as they browse the market.",

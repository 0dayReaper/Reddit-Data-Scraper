    "postText": "Really frustrated with my co-founder and just need to vent. He spends so much time on LinkedIn. We aren't hiring, and we aren't a B2B. Feels like it's all for vanity among his peers.\n\nHonestly, if you have time to be on LinkedIn, Twitter, or FB all day, you are not working. Period.\n\nEdit: woah, definitely wasn't prepared for such a huge response &amp; ironically our own circle jerk lol, but I appreciate the responses and different perspectives. I realize LinkedIn does have a lot of value for certain industries &amp; B2B. And it's not like my co-founder hasn't made good use of the network he's built, but sometimes it seems like a priority for him. We communicate very well, so I do plan on bringing this up(in a more elegant way). Anyways, I was just venting, and maybe in some twisted way looking for my own vanity?",

I wish I would have never put that on the back burner.\n\nBut all points are valid no matter the context. LinkedIn is shit to some. It is a tool for unemployed for some. It's a network tool ...

I\u2019ve been saying this for years, I only use social media to advertise, interact with customers etc. unless you\u2019re looking to give away a buck, or are desperate LinkedIn is your best friend.\n\nI genuinely hate the idea of working and seeing people brag about being a workaholic behind their work from home set up is cringe.\n\n\nLike the fact you need to see a motivational post, or someone\u2019s opinion to get you through the day in general is quite childish, and cringe. I sat through a lecture in sociology that was quite extreme at the time, but LinkedIn made it make sense, in the way society is heading.\n\nLike all social media there\u2019s that human connection bonus, but at what cost? I\u2019d rather just shoot someone an email. Chances are if I need your investment you lost out also because I\u2019m yet to ask. Also I have my own family and life so tugging eachother off is just annoying, plus I have like 6 other areas I want to learn and deep dive into, only the intellectually stupid have time for it.\n\n\nProbably would cut your business partner and hire a freelance marketer. Any types of serious deals should go through you anyways.\n\n\nThis is not business advice but yeah cut him out. You can probably keep more capital hiring a good marketer over your areas general wage demand. I\u2019d be ecstatic to be over paid to promote a product, or interact with people. I hire free lancers all the time and pay their price, tons of pros. Graphic editing, down to can you read this to make sure it\u2019s proper English.\n\n\nIf you can find one person to do those tasks for you, and you pay them well, that\u2019s the bread to your butter, not a co owner.\n\n\nIf he\u2019s a good friend, I\u2019d say the truth look man, here\u2019s how I see your role, I\u2019m not letting my BFF make a killing off my work or let alone brag  lmao, unless it\u2019s for publicity and it\u2019s fine right, I don\u2019t have a BFF that\u2019s a marketer.\n\n\nBusinesses strain relationships. This is exactly why I wanted 0 friends involved with my business.\n\n\nAlso even if I do hire a full time marketer, you\u2019re gonna explain what you\u2019re doing full a long time before you do it. \n\n\nI\u2019d suggest you watch Linus tech tips we have the same disorder and same thinking on small businesses. Lots of good interviews. Trial/error/goodvsbad micro managing, even talking about your first employees. Good stuff as I have absolutely come across the same obstacles/ tough decisions.",

    "postText": "I was hoping to open a small store (with a larger focus on deli/carvery - it makes sense given the area), but the equipment cost is crippling, and thats second hand stuff not new.\n\nI honestly dont have the money to do it and im unlikely able to get a loan given the fact I have a mortgage etc. I have a meeting with the bank and with microfinance but if it doesnt work are there any funding incentives for this type of business in Ireland? What would you suggest doing. \n\nThe way i see it, money spent on equipment would be mostly recouped even if it went belly up (which i think it wont given the research i have done) on the resale of those items. \n\nIts more the day to day running costs that obviously cant wages, light and heat, rates etc. The spot ive looked at is giving it to me at \u20ac1500 returnable deposit at a rental cost of only \u20ac50 per week for first 3 months at which time i can leave the premise or stay on for the next 9 months at \u20ac185 per month.\n\nI studied Accounting. Never used accounting. Spent years in retail and retail mgt and switched to teaching.",

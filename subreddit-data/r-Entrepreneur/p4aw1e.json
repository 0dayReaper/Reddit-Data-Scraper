    "postText": "A year ago, I launched my candle business with $100, and I made 25k in total sales.\u00a0\n\nThis is my first post as a business owner, I always dreamed of making/selling something, anything! I finally did, a year ago, and I thought it would be helpful/empowering to anyone who wants to start a business.\u00a0\n\n**Why candles?**\u00a0\n\nThere is a big market for candles, and the product is validated. The process of making them is easy to learn and you don\u2019t need a special expertise to come up with great scents, many free resources are available to help with that.\n\nYou also don\u2019t need a lot of capital to get started, and it\u2019s an easy business to run from home.\u00a0\n\nMy goal was to find the most convenient cost effective product and to build a brand around it. This way, I won\u2019t find excuses for myself and spend months ruminating about the perfect product.\u00a0\n\n**How did I brand my candles?**\n\nA candle with a story and a purpose is more appealing than just a scented candle on the supermarket shelf.\u00a0\n\nI branded my candles around my personal hobbies, I thought of my daily activities and how a candle could fit in there.\n\nThe first idea I came up with was candles to light when watching a movie, the scents will be based on classics such as the godfather, pulp fiction etc.\u00a0\n\nBut then, I realized that I should come up with a broader use case for my candles, that\u2019s how the idea to base the candles on movie genres was born.\u00a0\n\nI kept brainstorming about my hobbies and I came up with candles for each hobby I had, gaming candles, bookish candles and as I was learning web development at the time, coding candles. Now, I had to choose one of them to brand my business around, it was a tough choice and I wasn\u2019t sure which one would be more attractive.\n\nFrom there, I thought why not create a brand around the combination of those hobbies, as a result I came up with the name geekycandles, candles to empower the nerd in all of us.\u00a0\n\nNow I had to decide how many candles should be in each collection, pick a name and a combination of scents for each one to test.\u00a0\n\n**Starting with $100!**\n\nNow that I have a clear idea of my product. It\u2019s time to actually test the scents I brainstormed for each candle.\u00a0\n\nI went to a candle shop, bought fragrance oils ($60 for 12 different fragrance samples) and 2 pounds of soy wax ( $7 for 1 pound).\u00a0\n\nWicks were cheaper on amazon ($10 for 100 units) then to the dollar store to buy glass shots (4 boxes of 6 for $9).\u00a0\n\nAt this point, I have all I need to start making my candles and testing the combination of scents I brainstormed for each candle.\u00a0\n\nThe shot glasses are used as containers, after pouring the wax and fragrance oil in the glass, I would give the candle 3 days to cure, then light it in the bathroom (a small space), close the door, give it a good 15 minutes for the fragrance to spread, then enter the bathroom to smell the candle. This is how the testing was done. Now my product is ready!\u00a0\n\n[Click here](http://imgur.com/a/L8Yocc8) to see a picture of my testing candles.\u00a0\n\n**Creating the website:**\n\nI can\u2019t recommend Shopify enough, they offer 3 months free of charge and it makes the whole task easy! So many great tutorials are available on youtube to help you understand the whole process.\n\nI took a day or two to look at other e-commerce websites, especially candle websites to get some inspiration. I wanted a clean, straightforward website and I found the right template on Shopify. It took me a week to build the website, add each product and its description.\u00a0\n\nCandles pictures were made on photoshop, so was the label. I am no expert, but tutorial videos and forums did the trick. (I can give more details on this part if you are interested)\n\n**Selling the product:**\u00a0\n\nBefore I dive in, I wanted to make clear that at this point, I absolutely had no supplies. I didn\u2019t want to spend money on a product that is not validated yet!\u00a0\n\nMy idea was to make a list of my suppliers and their shipping delays:\u00a0\n\n* Jars and shipping supplies would arrive a day after ordering,\n* Fragrances, wax and wicks can be bought from the store on the same day (i can\u2019t stress enough the importance of trying to find suppliers that are in the same city! Shipping can be unpredictable)\u00a0\n\nAlright! My website is ready, I am ready! Let\u2019s try and sell those babies.\u00a0\n\nAs a reminder, I moved to Canada a couple of months before, I didn\u2019t have a social circle to help me spread the word.\u00a0\n\nSo I started with creating my social pages, IG, twitter and facebook.\u00a0\n\nNothing came out of it, but I was happy with getting a few followers.\u00a0\n\nThen, I created a 20% coupon code and shared it in Reddit, facebook market and some facebook groups. That\u2019s how I got my 5 first sales in one day!!\u00a0\n\nI was over the top! At this point, I was clicks away from ordering the supplies to make my candles.\n\nThe day after my first orders, I had all my supplies, and made the candles. I shipped them two days later, taking the time to pack them and sort out the shipping process.\u00a0\n\n**Growing the business:**\u00a0\n\nIn my experience, the most challenging part of starting my E-commerce business is to drive relevant traffic to my website.\u00a0\n\nI started to post picture of my candles on relevant subreddits, and recurrently (no as recurrent as I should) posting on my social media. I also made sure to start a newsletter, offering a 10% coupon to anyone who would subscribe. Today, I have around 500 subscribers and I make sure to not spam their inboxes, emailing them only when there is a promotion or a new product.\u00a0\n\nI am still struggling with emailing my subscribers, it\u2019s unclear to me how frequent should I email them and what content would they be interested in.\u00a0\n\nI also went through the influencer path, Dm\u2019d couple of instagramers and asked if they\u2019d be interested on sharing my product in their page. I received many positive answers but didn\u2019t get enough sales, one sale from a bookish instagramer with 24k to whom I sent three candles. The sale covered the expense of the product and its shipping. Atm, I stopped focusing on influencers, I might reconsider this path in the near future.\u00a0\n\nI also emailed bunch of retailers who might be a great fit to resell my product and in one year I was able to sell to 6 retailers. I am not doing enough in this department, I could have contacted more retailers and got more wholesale orders. I am planning on doing that more, specially that I received a great feedback from my retailers.\n\nI created an Etsy store halfway through the year, it barely had a cost and you can take advantage of Etsy\u2019s algorithm to gain some exposure. I made 3k in Etsy alone, for a very low cost.\n\nYou only need to pay $0.20 to list one product for 4 months. So yeah, totally worth it!\u00a0\n\n**Luck**:\n\nHere are some beautiful events that just happened. I have to admit that being a local business and offering a sustainable clean eco-friendly product helped a lot.\u00a0\n\n* My local hospital got in touch with me to buy my candles for their nurses, they simply googled local businesses and found out about me, I sold them 60 candles.\u00a0\n* My domain provider featured my business in one of their newsletter and it got me a huge amount of traffic with a great conversion rate.\u00a0\n* My local library foundation found out about my business through a google search, they purchased 100 bookish candles.\u00a0\n* A journalist included my website in an article written in yahoo, as a sustainable environment friendly business.\n\n**Mistakes:**\u00a0\n\nFirstly, I am not consistent on social media, and it\u2019s because I am intimidated by taking \u201dinstagramable\u201d pictures of my candles. I am working on that, and searching budget friendly setups for taking good pictures.\u00a0\n\nSecondly, I turned my back on paid ads, and that\u2019s because I\u2019ve invested around $300 in google facebook and IG ads. I didn\u2019t get any sales from those ads and gave up on them. I am well aware that paid ads take time and money to figure out, I just felt like I can market my products using free channels as a starting point and once I generate some profit reinvest a chunk of it on paid ads.\u00a0\n\nThirdly, I don\u2019t have clear strategy to communicate with my subscribers. I email them when there is a promotion running or a new product. I feel like I can build a stronger, closer relationship with them but I still didn\u2019t figure out how to do that! I should probably take some time and do some research in this area.\u00a0\n\nLastly, I don\u2019t reach out to retailers as I should have, I\u2019ve had a great response rate from previous emails sent to potential resellers, but for some reason (mainly procrastination) I didn\u2019t stick to a specific number of retailer to email on a weekly basis.\u00a0\n\nI wish I had more online presence, and report more often on my progress, successes, failures, lessons and mistakes. It might be helpful for anyone who\u2019s trying to build a business and also it will make me accountable to my audience and thus STOP PROCRASTINATING!\n\nIf you have any questions about my journey, or want to chat, please reach out, I will be more than happy to share and help. Also, any critic or feedback is welcomed, I am learning and always will!\u00a0\n\nLinks:\u00a0\n\n[Click here](https://imgur.com/a/FkWJhQR) for screen shots of my total sales.\n\nI am adding a link to my website to have an idea about my products and how I built every collection:   \n[www.geekycandles.ca](http://www.geekycandles.ca/)  \nHere is also a link to my IG page to see how I am working on improving pictures of the products and how I suck at publishing more often :/\u00a0 [www.geekycandles.ca/geekycandles](http://www.geekycandles.ca/geekycandles)\n\nAlso if you want to help me procrastinate less!

An acquaintance of mine lost her home in a fire when a candle from the dollar store burned low and got the glass so hot it exploded and sent fiery wax around the room. You should look into getting tempered glass for this purpose, and include a disclaimer/warning that they should not be burned below 25%. This is actually what firefighters will tell you about any candle at all, never let them burn below 25%.",

            "comment": "Amazing! Can't believe how good Shopify is to setting up ecom stores, I'm looking forward to getting used to the platform!\n\nCouple of things I'd do in reference to the marketing side of things\n\n1. Retargeting - I can see you've got a FB pixel installed on your website, run a Retargeting campaign for people who visited the site &lt;30 days. Use the dynamic product ads which run your candles in a feed on FB. Run the objective as conversion purchases and try to lower cost per acquisition by focusing on the offer (20% off? free shipping? whatever you can fit in your margins). If your propsecting using free channels, retargeting ads will be super cheap (Cost per thousand impressions) and you'll get a good conversion rate!\n2. Reddit ads: Not sure if you've used reddit before for ads, but this would definitely fit into your product well! You can target by subreddit and CPM's are quite low too. CTR's are around 0.05% for good performing ads, so try to factor in CPM's if they come around $40, how many of a thousand will click on the site (0.05%), then your sites conv% (4% of total clicks will convert). Then you know how much you can spend to acquire a customer.\n3. Google Shopping Ads: again you might be running them, but very good to get started with!\n4. SEO: Could you make blog posts around films with candles? Try to look on Neil Patel's Ubersuggest site for content opportunities, and just make them easily readable and informative. I can tell you write well by this post, so go for it! Or look for a site called Fiverr and hire someone to write one for you.\n\nMassive congrats on everything and keep up the hard work! If you ever need hand with anything, or some friendly advice, shoot me a message :-) Love to see a fellow Reddit'er succeed.",

The spacing was good imho, but if there's anything that I've taken away from books like 'The Lean Startup', is that the key to you scaling your business in an efficient manner, is A/B testing... and lots of it. Try slightly different layouts, leveraging A/B testing to analyze what elicits more conversions and larger AOV.\n\nThe vibes of the candles are very different, but as a group they are still cohesive. But what I felt was, the concept of aromatherapy for productivity in coding/gaming would appeal to an audience that is disparate from the audience that wants to use aromatherapy for calming purposes.\n\nSo let's think about it from your ad campaign's perspective. The messaging that excites a gamer could be oriented around being more alert and/or more immersion into the fast-paced world of the game they're playing. We're thinking about words like \"fast twitch\", \"hand-eye coordination\", etc.\n\nThe messaging that intrigues a reader could be oriented around calm, and immersion into a story, which is more cerebral... were talking about heavy olfactory keys and memory recall... \"leather\", \"coffee\" and alot of the other sense-inducing words you use seem effective in generating a desire to purchase for this purpose.\n\nSo, imagine you were using influencer marketing? One the one hand you're going to want to use a gamer to advertise the smells, maybe smells that are specifically in concert with a new and wildly popular game. Now that influencer can associate the smell of the candle with a more positive experience of the game.\n\nOn the other hand, for the bookish candles, you'd might want an older influencer who speaks on literary matters. Maybe where they take a more nostalgic tact, which fits well with your \"Old Bookstore\" set, for example.",

Maybe you'll find some of his tips insightful.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience. I've always wondered how household items can sell well online, since you can find them in grocery stores (though when I shopped for candles, most of the ones in big stores smelt like plastic). It seems like a lot of the success comes from applying modern techniques (SEO, social media, online presence) to traditional products.",

Keep your cash, if they give you net 30 terms star by paying in 45. Then stretch them all to pay the monthly after you receive invoice. Some will be 60 some will be 31. Cash is king, if you have a select few you quick pay as they are small like you OK . But stretch it out if you can.\n\nWell done and good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

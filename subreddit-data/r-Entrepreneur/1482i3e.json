Perhaps they could have given up on Water Displacement formula 39, who would have blamed them? \n\nIdeas are a work in progress, they will evolve. You may apply a concept from idea #4 to idea # 15.  You may see something happening right in front of you every day; Become highly inquisitive and question how things are being done and why? \n\nLook for things where people have built workarounds and systems to make things easier.",

I periodically review these notes to see if my skills/assumptions/tech/market have changed enough to pursue it as a project.",

Ideas are easy because no one's challenging them and they don't exist in the real world, and therefore unexpected problems don't arise.\n\nBuilding a business is like running a marathon. You can't run it all at once, you have no choice but to take one step at a time.\n\nEven if they're not in the right order, just do something. Take a first step. Buy a domain name, write down a summary of how the business will work.  Before you know it you'll have a functioning MVP!",

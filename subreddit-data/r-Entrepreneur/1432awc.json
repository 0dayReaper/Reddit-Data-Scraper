    "postText": "3.5 years ago my venture studio was acquired. I was head of product/growth, specializing in CRO/SEO/UX. I got a payout from the acquisition, but not a game changing amount of money by any means. \n\n2 years later I\u2019m a dad with 2 kids under 2. I\u2019ve been daddy daycare while I try to figure out what\u2019s next and my wife works.. But the longer that goes by the more lost I feel. It\u2019s hard to find the energy.\n\nPart of me yearns to innovate and solve problems (I have no shortage of ideas that are worth testing) but the other says get a job or buy a boring cash flowing business so I can pay for a nanny and get back to working full time. \n\n I keep flip flopping on the best move for me .\n\nWould love to hear perspective and advice from entrepreneurs who have juggled family life and been confused on direction.\n\nThank you!",

Either softly launching yourself into it by seeing if either your old company, or any of your old clients need any help?\n\nOr could you start building a personal brand on linkedin, throw up a website and let people know you're available?\n\nOr even put yourself out there on Upwork, or Toptal?\n\nStarting a whole new venture and testing ideas etc is fun and exciting but is unlikely to generate income immediately.\n\nI work for myself now running affiliate sites, but slowly transitioned from 5 days, to 4, to 3 to 0 working for agencies.. It took a few years, but it meant that I could dovetail the two streams of income until I was ready to make the jump\n\nCould you do the same with consulting to get some consulting cashflow going, get the ol' noodle working again, and then test your ideas as you go with a view to shifting over to it when you're confident it's going to work?",

The nanny soaks up a lot of my income so I\u2019m really working 40+ hrs a week for the 401k contributions, a little extra cash flow, and work experience. Our nanny is great but life is exhausting keeping up with the kids, their schooling, activities on top of work and home chores. I\u2019m probably leaving my job in the fall to be a stay at home dad until both kids are in school then maybe go back to work since. We barely get through the week. We plan sub par family vacations at the last minute and and weekends are for errands and chores, not relaxing.\n\nI know it sounds cliche but these moments with your kids are precious and they\u2019ll never happen again. Consider if the difference in money, stress and time away from your kids is worth it.",

            "comment": "I absolutely love this question. I've doing my solo thing for 10 years and I'm kinda sorta at the foundational stages of transitioning into something new. I launched my last thing from zero with a 2-year-old and newborn (and a wife who was at home). Now they're 10 and 12 and my wife works from home. The last thing was driven by urgency and cash flow, the new thing has different circumstances surrounding it.\n\nI think a mindset shift is what you really need. Forgive me for any ill-advised assumptions but I'm gonna roll with it. \n\nRight now, you're caught in loop that's being driven by a focus on the end choice (the outcome). You see 3 paths in front of you, you have no idea which want to pick, and that causes a kind of anxiety.\n\nWhat you need to do is ignore the possible outcomes, and focus on the process of finding your own personal clarity. You need that \"ah-ha\" moment where it clicks and you say - \"The next phase of my professional life is going to be doing X.\" \n\nYou can't force that with a list of three choices and a weighted pro/con assessment.\n\nIt's like telling an 18-year-old that all he needs to answer the \"what do you want to do with your life?\" question is to weigh the benefits and pick a major.\n\nInstead - EMBRACE where you're at. You have an incredibly unique opportunity to enjoy the journey of self-discovery. Treat this like an entrepreneurial problem and be your own client.\n\nRandom note - I've never been a social media type. But new things could benefit from it, so I've been hanging out a bit on Twitter amongst the \"solopreneur/creator\" kind of crowd. It's almost too positive - but what's great is the overall spirit of \"let's hop on a call!\". Maybe networking with like-minded individuals would be a positive step.",

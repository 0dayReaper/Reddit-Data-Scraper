Have your parents take you to Walmart or something and buy some candy in bulk. Then sell individual candy bars at like $1- $2 a piece (depending on the candy). Just remember to not eat all of your profits LOL.",

Also write down a list of things children your age like to do. Hopefully you will find something in one of those lists that will give you an idea of an online business. \n\nGood luck. Proud of you for thinking like this at 11",

He buys what he thinks will resell for profit with his own money that he made cleaning trash bins around the neighborhood with his friend and we will list it on eBay. Last weekend he bought $4 worth of stuff that should bring in around $50 of sales. I will give him his net profit so he can buy more stuff. It\u2019s also a great way for my son to learn how to negotiate and how to discreetly lookup values. \n\nMy wife and I have a lucrative e-commerce business and we got started by accident selling extra stuff we had laying around our house on eBay over 10 years ago. You should look into flipping first.",

Picking up freebies on the walk home to flip on social. It all goes far in the long run and I even keep an eye out now whilst driving what's been left in skips ect. Make money every way you can",

Since you're 11, you might not yet know how the world actually work yet as most of the adult problems you're not aware of yet are handled by your parents and the group which encounters problems that are relevant to you might not have money to pay for the solution.\n\nSo, if I were you I'd be looking at problems in your group which your parents want to pay to solve. One thing that springs to mind is educational materials - you might partner with your teacher and come up with something that is teaching while does not feel like teaching, but rather as pure fun. Look at TT rock stars for example - it attempts gamification of times table learning, but it is still just an educational app pretending to be a game and as such rather more of a chore than fun.",

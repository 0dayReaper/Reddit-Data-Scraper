    "postText": "Hi all.\n\nI'll try and be brief; I'm working with a team to make a type of complex sports safety equipment. This type of safety equipment exists in other sporting sectors, but through a fairly complex adaptation of existing products, as well as an entirely new suite of sensors, we will be bringing the equipment to a new market. \n\nNow, there are numerous OEMs who make a significant part of this safety equipment for various sporting industries, largely by working with established brands.\n\nWe want to find one of these OEMs and establish a similar relationship, buying a significant part of the final product (I would say at least 50% of the products inherent value), and then adding our own electronics &amp; packaging, and taking the product to market.\n\nNow, we're fairly heavily invested at this point, and have done a LOT of the groundwork including complex research, electronics design and prototyping, and my primary concern is that one of these OEMs could absolutely take the idea, and either reverse engineer our product, or design a competing one from scratch (we will be making this much easier for them by providing the specification for the parts we need to purchase from them)\n\nI personally object to patenting. We have ringfenced some cash to do so, but I would much MUCH rather spent that money on a more meaningful part of the designing phase we have yet to undertake. The patenting process would also add at least 6 months to our timeline. I'm also concerned that, if we approach one of these OEMs, they won't be interested due to the possibly restrictive nature of the patent.\n\nThanks for any input. I'm an entrepreneur of almost a decade now, but I have never had to work with complex IP.\n\n**TLDR: I need to buy a part from a large manufacturer for our product. How do I establish a relationship with them without them taking the entire idea, ideally without patenting**",

The only cost of admission is a referral of another like-minded person that has some skill and knowledge to share!\n\nI believe in abundance and in the power of crowdsourcing. This community will be the catalyst for a ton of great businesses coming to market in the near future.\n\nIf  you're interested in teaming up we'd love to have you! The link is in my bio.",
